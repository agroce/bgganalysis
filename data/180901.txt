RATING: 8
Trick taking with area control sounds like a combination that only Friese's 504 would throw together.  In fact Joraku makes those unlikely partners work surprisingly well. In the card play there is a nice tension between playing to win the trick and playing to place cubes in the areas you want.  This grows stronger as the game progresses because the high scoring areas shift towards the low numbers.  Joraku also presents interesting decisions about investing heavily in the final round bloodbath that will be Kyoto or dispersing your forces more economically to pick up points here and there.  The game plays quickly, it's interactive and it gives you a few things to think about.

I find the artwork appealing and production quality is good.  Poorly translated rules sets have plagued games produced in Asia, but the English rules to Joraku are very well done.

Simple, elegant. 30-40 minutes. Two very tried and tested mechanics: trick taking, and area control. Yet it comes together refreshed. The westward migration towards Kyoto and its elevating VPs makes the game interesting.

Lovely package, though very pricey.

Our group has one concern: how powerful is the player who plays the very last card of the game? Having the hammer with Kyoto being worth so much seems to win you the game.

RATING: 6
Pretty neat mish-mash of trick-taking and area majority.

The super neat thing is that each time you play a card, you get to take some actions with it. So, you're not only playing to win tricks, but you're also doing stuff with every card you play.

There is one thing that bothered me a bit about this game. In most trick-taking games, high cards are strictly better than low cards. This is doubly true in Joraku... high cards both allow you to do more stuff AND win tricks. I kind of wish they ad made the decision-making a little more interesting by making low cards powerful when played to balance out luck of the draw.

However, still a neat game overall with some unique ideas.

RATING: 8
Trick taking game where winning or losing tricks can be equally beneficial to you, depending on board position. An elegant and economical area majority game, where a card can be used for putting soldiers on the map, moving them around, or killing opponent soldiers. This multiplicity of uses and an initial draft passing mechanism ensure sufficient hand luck mitigation to allow the formulation of a strategy regardless of your draw. Lovely design, and beautiful art.

Here's an interesting game. There are 6 areas on the board and the card you play into a trick determines what pieces you can move around on the board to attempt to get majorities in the various regions. 

Whilst Joraku does break new ground in terms of translating a trick taking game onto an area control board, it doesn't feel like a ground breaking game. It is certainly different enough to merit further exploration, but I suspect I will move it on by this time next year.

RATING: 5
The concept of Joraku is very strange. A fusion of trick-taking and area control, while creative, often proves difficult for new players to grasp. Players can score points by through trick-taking and by controlling regions at the end of each round, which when properly understood provides a nice flexibility. Additionally, with each passing rounds, the scoring areas consolidate, forcing players to shift their focus, and influence, after each round. The game is a bit too short, but is unique and a nice way to add more 'game' to (insert favorite trick game here) night.

File this under games I don't want to like. It is a trick taking game with an area control board element where it is more important where you are on the board when the trick is won than winning the trick itself, which decides who goes first the next turn. Also, the area control advantages shifts from high dice rolls at the start to low dice rolls at the end.

Lovely aggressive trick-taking/area majority game. Players are spread out a bit at first, but the point rewards throughout the game's three rounds force players closer and closer together, with bloody mayhem as the consequence.

Mechanically, the game works great. Artwork is fine and thematically evocative, but the theme is not particularly strong.

[b]Competing interests:[/b]
The board consists of 7 regions side-by-side. The left-most is unnumbered, to the right of it is region 1, to the right of that region 2, etc. The cards are numbered 1-6. You play 3 rounds (hands) and at the end of each round you score each region. In the first scoring the high numbered regions are worth the most, in the third scoring it's the low numbered regions. Throughout the game attention shifts between the regions and you are constantly having to weigh the expected payout of fighting for a valuable region against a more modest but less contested region. 

[center][ImageID=2600036 medium][/center]
There is another layer. Each hand you will play a card and the value of the card can give you movement points to shift influence around on the board, or allow you to add new influence to the corresponding region. How you value each card changes dramatically as the game progress depending on where you are focusing your attention on the board. The winner of the trick (highest card regardless of suit, although you must follow suit if you can) scores the region where their daimyo piece is, this is just a small scoring awarding 3, 2, 1 points for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most influence in the region. So there is certainly an incentive to win tricks but if you do you play first in the next trick which is a big disadvantage. This structure also incentivizes you to be present where other players' daimyos are. 

Looking over what I just wrote I realize I'm not doing a great job conveying how elegant this system is. There are very few moving parts and they combine to make all the decisions difficult and the game tense from start to finish.

[b]Trick-taking:[/b]
This doesn't feel much like a trick-taking game. You are very seldom using any of the heuristics you have built up from conventional trick-taking games. The decision of which card to play is interesting but is dominated by the state of the board, not usually the state of your hand. You don't need to win tricks, although doing so can be helpful and you will play differently if you have a strong hand versus a weak hand.

Like many games I've played from Japanese designers, it's about 85% of the way to being a great game. I still feel that there is a lot of room in the trick-taking genre for innovative use of a board. But this felt kind of plodding and predetermined. There are some good ideas, but ultimately I don't feel compelled to play this.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Interesting blend of trick taking and area majorities. Can be aggravating to have no way of returning cubes back to the supply making ninjas much less valuable later in the game unless someone does the favor of removing your cubes with their action. Removing cubes really appears to be something I'd recommend only doing if absolutely necessary though since it gives that person a future edge for placement of cubes.

This is a pretty straightforward area control game combined with a pretty simple trick taking game. It's the combination that makes it interesting.

You definitely have to pay attention to both the area control and the trick taking in order to win (unless no one else is); sometimes making sacrifices in one to have greater gains in the other.

The mental leaps required to determine how your trick taking strategy impacts your area control situation and vice versa make it weird to grok, but the rules are straightforward and easy to remember.

What an amazing game and amazing amount of game in such a small box (the TMG reprint)!

Provisional rating based on one play. -- I love the combined area-control and trick-taking mechanism, and the small box. Small and interesting ruleset. One designer on BGG I trust feels there is too big an advantage getting the last move on the final turn--I'll have to see. -- There seem to be variant boards: the one I've got has a snaking score track, others have a score track around the rim of the board. The snake track is TERRIBLE OMG... you should use chips or pen & paper to keep track as you are guaranteed to screw up shunting those cubes around. (Don't forget to remove 1 cube apiece if you do this, rather than add the score cube to players' supply!)

This is an area majority game on a board where placements and scoring is determined by trick taking card game. Very dependent on the cards dealt despite a 2 from 5 drafting mechanism. When would you ever not keep the highest value cards? A bit too luck driven even for me!

Another trick-taking game. But again, that's just the conduit. It's really an area-control game. What makes this game really clever is the double use of the numbered cards for winning tricks AND action points to be spent based on the number on the card itself AND the number of the board segment.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4 -> 4)[/COLOR]

[i]I would play this again only because a buddy of mine likes it. I still think the random nature of cards doesn't work for me in an area control game. I prefer having complete control over my actions in these types of games. Who knows, maybe I missed something.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I was really excited to play this, but was really disappointed after we finished our game. While the game play is nothing like Raptor it suffers from the same issues I had with that game. You have a very basic trick taker mashed together with an okay area control game. The problem is the randomness of the cards not only effects winning tricks, but also what you can do in regards to moving/placing units on the board. The two mechanics feel disjointed and don't work well together due to the amount of randomness in the game. The last thing an area control game needs is a large dose of random, it does not reward well thought out strategies at all.[/i]

Based on one play: Don't be fooled, this is an area majority game and not a trick taking game. The components and theme are very nice but the game is fairly simple. There are a lot of instances where we were mistaken by what was going to score, the number on the card or the location of the player piece, but once everyone got the hang of it there were no issues. You don't have much control on the card play so the board is where you must focus but even there it is tough to actually make a plan as you have so few actions.

So much fun the first couple of times, but after awhile the rush to the palace wears a little thin. Then you realize the last player has such a huge advantage, the game becomes trying to engineer having the last turn during the penultimate turn, ad infinitum. Still enjoyable, just less so as time goes on. 

This game makes me want to provide a graph for every comment of fun vs number of plays. This one is negative slope. At this point I really only care about games with a positive slope.

Disappointing. When a friend said that the game looks like a trick-taking game but it's really an area majority game, he was right! Strategies and tactics you'd expect from a trick taking game are hardly important here. Trick taking mechanics serve to add the required chaos to make an area majority game interesting.

This itself wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the fact that luck plays a too massive role in this game. Most traditional trick taking games balance luck out by requiring players to play a lot of rounds. In this one, there's only three rounds, and the high valued cards are way, way too powerful, especially late in the game when they count more.

I do like the compact size of the game, though.

Mixing trick-taking and area control works surprisingly well. I don't understand the low ratings or people claiming a lack of control or strategy. Everything seemed tight to me.

Balancing the various scoring opportunities should keep things interesting.

Fascinating merge of trick taking and area influence. I like the interplay between cards played in a trick, though I am wary of some balancing of starting positions. But, like many trick-taking games, this merits more plays to discover its subtleties.

It bears to mention that the layout of that score track is absolutely horrendous.

A neat combination of trick taking and area majority.  The luck may be higher than the influence of decisions, but the decisions still feel tests and interesting in the moment.  Probably best with 3 players and a little politics.  The variant cards look neat.

Interesting mechanism of using trick taking to fuel actions and control regions. You can win a trick but someone else could set it up so they get the points for it instead, because winning the trick just sets the location for determining points. Also like how regions drastically change in points over the course of the game, encouraging everyone to migrate their units across the board. Feels like a larger game than its tiny box suggests, and worth checking out.

Played once with 3P. Combining trick-taking with area majorities is not exactly new – take a look at [thing=57759]Tindahan[/thing] – but Joraku weaves the two elements much closer together. Tricks serve a dual purpose here; each card played in a trick helps players expand or eliminate influence in a region, and there are also scoring and positioning benefits for winning a trick.

Despite the extremely slim deck, the multi-faceted nature of tricks takes a little getting accustomed to. I like the thematic push towards capturing Kyoto and the beautiful graphics, but I often felt like I didn't have sufficient control over the outcomes. This is likely due to a combination of inexperience and a few cards being left out in a 3P game, though. At the very least, I'm interested in trying this out again.

Joraku is a really interesting mashup of trick taking and area control, and it works! The game is strategic, tactical, and has a lot of complexity.

Overall, I enjoyed Joraku and would definitely play it more.

1 partial play (1 hand only!)

This is a unique blend of trick-taking (must follow suit if able; no trump) with area control. Your card plays not only help win tricks, they also allow you to place/move your samurai on the 7-regions of the board. Winning tricks awards a few points to players in your Daimyo's region, but the big points are given out at the end of each of the 3 hands, according to majorities in each area.

Need to play this again!

[Tasty Minstrel Games 2015 Edition] {Japan; Trick-taking, area-control; optimal 4p} Joraku is an area control game using traditional trick resolution to move cubes inside an area.  The game is vulnerable to AP.  High cards are obviously more rewarding than low cards (you can win a trick and have more action points); so luck is quite strong, even though there were 3 rounds to compensate this.

The game is less thematic than I am expected.

The variation rules increases replayability and requires different aspects of tactical decision compared to normal game.

I thought that this one was alright, it provided for an interesting dynamic as everything and everyone needed to shift from one side of the board to the other over the course of the game.

As a fan of both area control and trick-taking games, I had to try this one.

So far it seems really good. There's a lot to think about with every card you play because there is a scoring at the end of each trick, plus a larger scoring at the end of each round. You've got to balance placing your cubes, moving your "leader" token, and killing enemy cubes.

The variant cards that are included seem like they would be mostly broken, and not in a fun way. I may try them in the future but they seem like more of an afterthought than anything else.

Really solid so far, will rate after more plays.

After 5 plays I feel there is not enough ability in this game for players to control the outcome.  It's far too important to be playing the last card prior to the scoring phase - and while you can often avoid leading to that trick you can't force your left-hand neighbour to do that.  I like trick-taking games, and a favourite of mine, Chronicle, combines that mechanic with cards that have specific powers, but there the powers are more interesting and with more tricks to play you have more opportunity for hand management.

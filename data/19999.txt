Still the great balanced game it has been.  Its a little fiddly to teach but once its grokked it all hangs together so well!

A quick summary as to why I like it : it has neither perfect information nor total chaos with a nice helping of euro elegance.  Otherwise, Gamegrunt says it best:

[q="Gamegrunt"]The appeal of the game for me is the beauty of the decision process which often involves attempting to predict your opponent's intentions.  The placing of the four cards next to the four cartouches is pure gaming sublimity and how those four cards must balance offense and defense in equal measure against a formidable opponent.  With eight paths to victory, six ways to score points, the ascending power of the temple scoring (don't neglect the lowly 1st Temple - that will get you beat as well!) and the look and feel of the components makes Aton a game that for me succeeds in every way a game should succeed.  Its game play ever varies with a time trajectory that is amazingly brief.

This is a nice, light, and relatively quick two-player game from Queen Games. The game is beautifully produced, with a number of difficult decisions to make each turn. The only upside is that your opponent has it equally tough.

Logical game for two players in Egyptian climate. Like in many Egyptian games, the mechanic is barely connected to the subject. 
Rules are easy to learn, game is short. Some strategic moves can boost the probability of win, however randomness is big and in most cases the final results depends on luck.

Definitely a themeless math-based Euro fitting the "optimization puzzle" definition, but not "multiplayer solitaire" by any means.

I go for math-based optimization puzzles for about 5 plays, so I would definitely play it again and even recommend it.  It seems like the black spaces are too powerful and the green and yellow are underutilized, so it needs a tweaking to re-optimize.

Overall, the card management system and the 4 sectors of the board provide a real brain-burner challenge.  If you had a dinosaur or two in this, the rating would probably go to a 9.  Dinosaurs make everything better.

+ Compact game that can be pulled out and played in a short amount of time; Interesting variable ways to win.
- There is a large amount of luck in the cards that you draw, and when you draw them.


Why it's previously-owned:
The drawing of 4 random cards made it seem way to luck-dependent. In the end, there were just too many other 2-player games and/or other quick games that were better for us. 
This got traded away for Colossal Arena and Pergamon.

Perhaps we're wrong, but it seems that despite the appearance of lots of approaches, a "bug" in the game makes one strategy much more efficient than the rest.  After several plays, this strategy dominates, and it seems that if the other player does anything but copy-cat and interfere, they lose.  And then it comes down mostly to luck, and some small efficiency differences if nobody manages to pull off the temple 1 win (why temple 1?  because 1s in cart 3 are not a problem then, which is worth a lot).  Thus the game becomes tedious and mechanical -- lots of false choices you can't make.

This quick but thinky two player game is a great option if your gaming partner is competition averse : the card draw segments the decision space into manageable chunks and compels the player to move on with the game, while diluting responsibility for the take that aspects of the game, a bit like the fate mechanic in cosmic encounter which randomly determines who you'll attack.

There seems to be room to build strategies over several rounds, but will need further plays to verify it.

Interesting idea for a 2 player game with very quick turns. However, the game felt very random and abstract. I didn't feel like I had much control, or even a plan of what to do to have control over. Just dump as many tokens as possible into any temple. This game would be improved with a a player reference card or better iconic information.

A quick, simple two-player area control game.  Several ways of scoring.  First to forty vp's usually wins, though there are three varieties of sucker punch victory to trap the unwary.  Aton strikes a nice balance, giving you enough to think about, though not too much to slow the zippy pace. Production quality and artwork are both rather ordinary, though everything is functional.

Bastantes partidas no registradas.

Para ser el típico eurogame de mecánicas abstractas y tema pegadísimo (igual que puso egipto pudo poner roma o mi pueblo) no es mal juego del todo. Tal vez el final es un poco anticlimático, pero bueno, no está mal y dura poco. Las partidas cortas dan lugar a piques entre jugadores y a enlazar una con otra.

Eso sí, una vez convenientemente explotado, el juego ya no da para más pq resulta repetitivo. Así que se marchó a la casa de algún eurogamer de pura raza, no como yo.

I led off with like 5 or 6 plays in a row of this game.  Surprisingly good for 2 players, and I think it makes a kinda cool 2P majority game like Dynasties look like crap in comparison.  Super fast play time and a high density of decisions.  A foldable board, super-compact box, and perfect English rules would still make it better.  Queen seems to be on a minor roll after Roma.

Aton seems to be complicated game. Two players fight for majorities in 4 temples to get v-points, and there are several alternative ways to win the game (and sometimes v-points don't matter). Nevertheless the game is simple and quick. Each round you draw 4 cards and play 4 cards. They determine where and how many you can add/remove pawns and who will play first. When I played it I realize many choices in this game were obvious. I dislike it. I think Aton can be a gateway for abstract strategy games but nothing more.

RATING: 7.5
Traded. Didn't hit the table after initial plays. Scoring felt cumbersome after a break, but think that's what made this game great at the same time.

After playing China, I hunted down a good area majority game for 2 to play with my wife. There aren't that many due to its nature but Aton works great with 2. Theme is pasted on but we don't really mind as the gameplay is so good. Scoring is a bit fiddly though the rules are concise and usually works out.

As 2 player games go, this is one of the better strategy ones out there.  At its heart, it is an area majority game.  Game play is quick and games feel like they involve much more than the time the game takes.  This leaves you with a full feeling after a game (which is a very good thing).  Recommended. [GTI: AGSL]

A little gem of a game: the theme is obviously tacked on, but I have no problems playing abstracts when they're quick, light but challenging.

The game feels like it should be longer.

I think this game was originally longer and it was artificially truncated to make it fit a 30 minute ideal.  It's still an OK game, but it feels like a quickie version of a much greater game... and I'd like to play [i]that[/i] game.

What a great two player game!  It's abstract, but I love abstracts.  It also, to me, has a Amun Re feel and not just from the theme.  You have a hand and you are trying to set yourself up for potential scoring rounds but you want the scoring rounds to come when YOU want them to come.  Lots to think about.  To use the cliche, lots of game in a little package.  I'm looking forward to another game of it, soon!

Update 7/09 - raised to a 9.  One of my favorite two player games.  It's quick and the more I have played this gem, the deeper it has gotten.  So many different ways to play and win depending on your card draw.  Why didn't I learn this one sooner?

Heard about this on the Heavy Cardboard podcast and picked it up via a holiday game sale. I really enjoyed my first few plays of the game. The rules seem a little convoluted at first, but in practice once you are playing it is quite straightforward how the scoring works. Of course this is a high dose of luck in how you draw the cards, but it is a fun bluffing game to try to second guess what your opponent is doing.

A quick playing filler game that has a little more meat on the bones than some offerings its length. I enjoyed it and wouldn't turn down a few games in a row if the evening still had a little more time left. 

The only thing that I didn't fully enjoy was a "rushing" strategy that seemed to be emerging as we continued to play. It seemed quite powerful to just push super hard in one region by always putting 4's in the removal and addition spaces. This lets you pound area 1 very hard and could lead to a fast win. This can be counteracted by your opponent, but if they draw low hands and you draw high hands several turns in a row, then it is certainly possible.

This game seems to have an extraordinary number of arbitrary scoring mechanisms for a quick, 2-player game. Nevertheless, I like it (after one play) for what it is: an abstract with some nice artwork. However, it apparently fails husband's "Starfleet Battles" test; if it's easier to figure out how well you're doing in Starfleet Battles as compared to a given game, it should give you pause. He was also heard to say, "It's approaching the Eurogame version of Fizzbin." I feel it will improve with more plays. He feels it will improve with beer (note: he doesn't like beer). Sigh.

After several taught, fiercely-fought games, it's obvious there is a great deal of rich interaction packed into this quick little game.  Perfect for those "just one more!" back-to-back plays.  Stealing a win from the points-crazy leader (either by occupying all of one temple or distinct colored zones) is satisfying--or devastating, given your point of view.

Once you start to get the different kinds of strategy in this game, it becomes a wonderful game. It is quite exciting involving a lot of strategy some luck and a bit of bluff.

It usually lasts for two scorings and can be played several times because it does only take about 20-25 minutes to play.

I really like this rather simple but still very strategic game

Rules were awful. Until seeing the subtlety of actual
play, I was quite ready to give this a 4 or 5, as
a nearly pointless euro. It's an interesting two player
game though. Choices are fast paced, and don't really
require as much thought/memory as the rules seem
to suggest, yet they still affect you greatly.

This turned out to be a much better 2 player game than I had thought.   The trade off between winning by points vs winning by end condition is an interesting one, and adds some tension to the game.  Do you try to put your opponent away with the chance that you won't succeed, or do you slowly but surely score points?

The random cards, while critical to keeping the game interesting, do present a bit of a problem if one player gets a string of low numbers early.  It seems to me that havign an early lead is pretty important, as it is harder to remove tiles than it is to add them, and initial tile placement is probably a big advantage.

Somewhere there is an interesting game here, but the turn order and scoring mechanics are really unintuitive, so it's a real burden to get this to a table. If you haven't played in a while, you'll only start to remember how the scoring works halfway through the game,, but by then you may have made 3 or 4 crucial mistakes that are going to bite you in the end. 

None of this would be a problem if we played this more regularly, but there are just too many two-player games we like more than this. And for us, light, 30-minute fillers like this should not be this hard to learn or remember.

This is a very decent 2-person game. There are times when the play of cards tips the scales significantly in one player's direction. I've discussed with more than one friend about fixing this possible problem. Each player's deck is made up of four cards (valued 1 through 4). Cutting the deck size in half will reduce the likelihood of a single hand of four cards tipping the game significantly. However, I haven't tried this yet.

RATING: 6
Rating is based upon only one play. Aton is a pleasant but not outstanding two-player filler. The first start seemed slow, and the learning curve is steep, but the hill isn't very tall. After one or two turns, things moved very smoothly and quickly, and the ending was closer than I expected it to be. But despite it being a good game, with nothing really wrong with it, Aton didn't grab me as some other two-player games have.

Aton is an area majority game with a clever little card system for determining how you can place or remove guys from the various scoring areas. It also has several different win conditions, so you have to keep an eye on your opponent to make sure he's not getting too close to any given one of them.

However, as clever as the engine was, the game just felt really bland and mechanical to me, with the fun left out. There was also a lot of tit for tat style play that is common to many area majority games that I'm not a huge fan of. A well-designed game, but it just fell flat for me.

RATING: 3
Updated 8/17/10.

Played twice now, and it's official: Aton is simply lacking.  The components are mediocre.  The theme could not be more pasted on.  And the game may actually lack balance.  

As a short overview: In Aton, players draw a hand of cards numbered 1-4 and secretly assign each of them to one of four slots.  The value given to each slot determines a player's abilities for the round.  One slot gives you two points for each integer by which your played card is higher than your opponent's.  One slot allows you to remove some number of your opponent's tokens from the board, and another allows you to place some number of your own tokens.  The final slot determines exactly where you can place tokens.  

So the game is basically a risk/reward gamble to determine whether you can generate more than two points from your board play for every integer that you could have, but didn't, assign to the points-generating slot.  Board play has quickly diminishing returns, however, and a point threshold is one of the game end triggers.  So the answer is, in all likelihood, no, you can't.  As a result, the strategy often looks like this: place your highest card in the first slot.  Then min-max your board play based on the incomprehensible scoring system and hope for the best.  

While I don't despise the game, I can't imagine the gamer who gets their money's worth from it in entertainment value.  Dry, shallow, and partially broken.

I enjoy this game quite a bit. It has a nice bit of strategy to it. Still, I can't quite shake the feeling that it could have been something more and I find that I am starting to lean towards other games in my collection when I am in the mood for a two player game.

Edit: I think I enjoy this game more when I ignore the 40-point victory condition. Most games get to 40 points before the second scoring round which makes it feel fruitless to do anything other than try to win big on the first cartouche after the first scoring round.

Quick playing game where you're attempting to gain control of various areas for points or sudden victory. 

I often dislike games where you both place pieces and remove the opponent's pieces, but it doesn't bother me here. Possibly because it is easier to place than pull, possibly because you sometimes have to pull your own, and probably also because the pull mechanism is linked to the scoring mechanism.

I think it is the same problem I had with Mykerinos, nice mechanics, but I just don't feel anything while playing...
I won't turn down a game but I don't think I'll put it forth, I might get rid of it. This is the perfect example of a euro according to ameritrash players...

RATING: 8
Woah did this game surprise me! It looks bland; boring color palette, little wooden discs, small cards... Luckily, I don't mind as long as the gameplay is good - and it is!

The multiple paths to victory makes this game very interesting; usually the game is won by somebody scoring 40+ points, but it's the uncertainty about the other winning conditions that makes this game excellent; you constantly need to react to what your opponent does! Maybe you're way ahead in points, but perhaps your opponent has neglected one of the cartouches, which means that you can suddenly sweep in for one of the other winning conditions, i.e. completely filling a cartouche with your own discs! The other winning condition (holding all the green or yellow spots) can also be pursued, although it's in my opinion much harder to pull of.

The cardplay each round is amazing; you get four cards out of a deck consisting of cards valued 1-4, and you then have to place them in front of you under four different spots (aka cartouches); one gives you points, another determines turn order and is used to either remove your own (rarely, but sometimes, good) or your opponent's pieces.
If you're going for the points victory, you can use the second cartouche (removing discs) to speed up the game as scoring happens once 8 discs are removed. The last two spots determine in which of the fours area on the board you're allowed to place - and how many discs. During the last couple of turns turnorder can be crucial (if you want to sneak in and complete an area), so you have to think carefully about that, but it's nothing too brainburny; it's just that clever play is rewarded.

So, it's a constant battle of evaluating the different needs, and the game really is quite tense in the ~20 minutes it lasts.

It is probably one of my favorite short "2p only" games, and I've played it a lot with my wife. Highly recommended!

I like the simplicity of gameplay and the head to head competition. I felt the game was a little luck driven with card draw, even though everyone has the same deck of cards, but the order in which a player draws can alter the game. Nonetheless, good game, and a game I wouldn't mind playing.

There are lots of ways to win in this game.  Your offense is very important, but you also need to keep a close eye on what your opponent is doing.  We like the way you draw a set of cards and allocate them to determine what you can do each round.  The gameplay moves along very quickly, you never have to sit around waiting for your turn, and the game stays interesting throughout.  Although you have to maximize the effectiveness of the cards you get, the option to draw new cards once during the game is just right to mitigate a terrible pull of cards.  This game is a definite winner.

Aton is a strong multiple area majorities 2p game. It feels more like an Ystari original (Amyitis, Sylla, Assyria) rather than a Queen game. It is quite tense and unforgiving, with a need to look ahead quite a lot. It has an interesting ebb and flow to it, due to the variable win conditions, where as the leading player you will find yourself playing defensively, even destructively to keep that lead, while at the same time the defender constantly closes in to your position. 

Of course, the game has also a substantial luck-of-the draw element that might turn off some gamers, but I see this element as a strategy selector /variability element rather than  a hindrance to my enjoyment of the game. It is mainly a tactical game with quite a few wrinkles, and something I want to come back to often.  Rating might still go up if the game proves to be .

+ Strong and elegant design
+ The self-balancing victory point mechanism of cartouch 1 is pure genius
+ Easy to teach and quick to play
+ Tense, but also unforgiving if playing against a strong opponent
+ The theme is pleasantly pasted on, this is an abstract that does not feel like one
+ The components and art are functional and good looking.

= Mostly tactical, but with card counting/probability look-ahead opportunities
= Needs a few plays to get into the game 

- The box should have been half the size
- The rules are a bit vague, but the geek has all the answers here

This is a fantastic example of a good 2-player game that doesn't get too involved as to take too much time.

RATING: 5
Fast majority game for 2 with sufficient twists to keep you occupied for quite a while. The majority aspect 'works' in this case because of the multiple paths to victory, which keeps both players alert, and forces the tit-for-tat game into the background: you cannot concentrate on one aspect and hope to win, because someone else might pull off a sudden death victory on you. This keeps the game fresh, and shows that a lot of thought went into Aton's conception. What I dislike a little in the game is the card draw: although you are usually served with usable cards, they do make the game lighter than it could have been. Here Aton loses out to Mykerinos and San Marco: in Mykerinos luck is only present to a minor extent in the shape of the playing area, while in San Marco the divide-and-chose mechanism washes out the randomness of the card draw: both players have to make do with a single draw, after all. Nevertheless, Aton plays a lot quicker than these two, which is sometimes a plus as well. It's not a supergame, but it isn't mediocre either, and comes in an attractice and affordable package.

[b]Update[/b] After several more games, I'm beginning to wonder a bit about the effectiveness of some of the strategies. If you are into points, then control of the 4th temple blue squares, and the black squares is crucial. A nice surplus can be had from the double difference on cartouche 1. The problem is that points are obtained all the time, and thus form a sort of steady income which will see you win if you can keep it up long enough. If the other player is trying to pull off a sudden-death victory, he won't get a similar steady income in points to make up if his strategy fails. Therefore the game is not really forgiving in the sense that you can switch from one strategy to another in mid-game: once you are committed, you are committed, and must see it through to the end. Unfortunately, this means relying on a good card draw more than I deem proper. I will not say that it diminishes my playing pleasure at this point, but it did force me to revise my rating. If both players are after the same thing then it can become an exciting and quick game, despite the randomness as this this evens out between players. Not so when their targets differ, and that's a bit of a shame.

[b]Update 2[/b] After a final game, it seemed empty and hollow to be chasing after targets based on what the cards gave you. I cannot really remember why the game performed the way it did; surely it must have performed differently in the past...? Or did I change...? Either way, I let the game go.

One of my favorite 2-player games.

May 2007 Wife was a bit stressed out on this one, but she beat me soundly on it.  For myself, it seams that luck of the cards has a pretty big affect on the outcome, but I think further plays will be needed before I can fairly rate this one.  It was fun.

September 2007. After a few more plays, this is turning out to be one of my favorite two player games.  I've bumped it up another half point from 8 to 8.5.

Seems the strategy that is most effective is to fill one temple.

June 2008.  Learned that I had one rule wrong since the beginning.  The card used to declare what temple you are working on (card #3) allows you to work on that temple or any temple LOWER than that card.  We only allowed the temple that matched the card.  Changes the strategy a bit.

Decent abstract two-player game.  The unique aspect here is that players draw four cards and then must assign them to four cartouches.  Each defines how and where you can score points - but there is always a trade-off.  For example, you might want to remove several of your opponent's counters from a scoring temple, but to do so you have to give up the right to go first.

A bit of a puzzle - very light and very fast.  It's an interesting diversion that I can see playing from time to time but won't be my favorite.

This is an awesome 2-player offering from Queen Games.  The tough decisions, quick turnaround (which mitigates the luck factor), and multiple victory conditions make this game a must play.  Think the ROMA set-up mechanic extended into an area-control game.  Instant win with my bride.  THANKS JAE!

I don't get it.  I don't feel that it's possible to plan in this game, but the randomness doesn't build tension either.  It seems arbitrary who wins.  I don't think thought is rewarded, but it feels like it should be.  Mostly uninspiring.

RATING: 8.5
The different strategies in this game are subtle, and with a few games, can be fine-tuned to finesse. The 'hall of the dead' is a fantastic timing mechanism in the game that can certainly be exploited to your advantage. 

I give this game high grades for it's simple rules, medium-depth strategy [it's not a true brain burner] and short play time. Would highly recommend as a two-player game.

Another great 2-player game.  Interesting choices, though you can get screwed by some bad card turns that are too close together (maybe that's the time to try for a yellow/green/temple victory if you think you'll fall way behind in points...).  But short and light enough that it's not a big deal.

Good, quick abstract two-player game where you really need to keep an eye on your opponent and all four ways they might be trying to win the game. In the meantime, you've got to keep all four of those ways to win in mind as the game changes quickly and be ready to take a chance on a different route if it presents itself. It's much more of a reactive game and can even present some bluffing opportunities. I like it!

Get over the "pasted on theme" y'all. It's an Egyptian motif. I like an Egyptian motif. 

Plus it's an absolutely brilliant game. 

EDIT: Played this for three hours today with a new gamer and was amazed when I looked at the clock. It felt like an hour tops. Totally absorbing, quick, exciting, and just all around wonderful. I love this game.

A nice two player abstract area control with multiple paths to victory.  Quick, yet meaningful gameplay.  Luck of the cards is manageable because you get to decide where to use each of the cards you draw.  All that said, it doesn't really ever fill me with the urge to play.  I'm not really sure why, perhaps everything feels a little bit too random for an abstract, and too themeless for a Euro.

This is a clever little game that flies under the radar in most gaming circles. It's a crazy fast, yet tight area control game with an interesting timing mechanism that can disrupt the best laid plans.

I should note that I only play it with the unofficial variant where you choose from a hand of 5 cards, instead of the normal 4. This provides each player more control and successfully mitigates the luck of a bad card draw.

Another abstract, number-crunching, calculation-fest of a euro-game. As usual  such offerings are dressed in a wafer thin theme which is irrelevant to game play.

My wife and I have enjoyed this area control with extras game a bunch over the past year and a half. It's really the multiply victory conditions that make this one shine.

RATING: 4
This is a two player area majority/abstract.  Each player has identical decks to one another with cards ranging from value to 1-4.  You use these cards to gain points, determine turn order, remove opponents pieces from the game board, and add pieces to the game board.  The board is divided into four temples.  Each of these temples provide special scoring to the person with the majority of pieces in the temple when you arrive at a scoring round.  Each temple also contains yellow squares, green squares, numbered squares and grey squares.  The grey squares provide points during scoring for the player that has the majority of grey squares and the numbered squares provide that many points during scoring for the player whose pieces is occupying the numbered space.  The game will end when someone reaches a set number of points, or achieve automatic victory by having occupying all spaces in one temple, all of the yellow pieces in the 4 temples or all of the green pieces in the four temples.

As for my opinion.  This feels almost too quick and narrow.  I say narrow because if you only go for an automatic victory condition, you will likely be crushed through points and it's not overly difficult to disrupt.  The automatic victories seem to be there if you can't seem to compete for points.  It also seems easier to autowin through controlling a temple than yellow or green squares since opponents would need a specific numbered card to mess up a temple win. It's a decent two player game but I think there are better options out there.

Received in trade March 1, 2012.

To say the least, Aton is a pretty subtle game. There's lots of choices, most have significance but no one is going to be that super critical game changing choice. The gameplay requires balance between the different avenues of victory. Too much concentration on one aspect may give you the win in that certain area, but your opponent will have three different neglected win conditions to work with. The product is a simple playing, yet somewhat deep 2 player area control game that works with two. The most original concept this game offers is the alternating win conditions. This is the first 2p game I have seen with multiple winning conditions. If you like lighter, quicker 2p games, you may want to look at this title.

The Egyptian theme appeals to me and this was a nice one to try with solid Queen quality components. The scoring mechanism is unique and very interesting. Various win conditions have been fulfilled in our games - first to 40 points, one temple controlled and yellow zones filled. It's a bit too light for us though. We have enough of those 'evening over a coffee' type games that we like better, and I am working on getting heavier games into the collection.

We struggled to understand the rules, especially the 2nd Cartouche, but when we got it, Aton suddenly became an interesting game. The choices are simple, the points values become more obvious as play progresses, and understanding where the value lies is crucial to your choices. So you may get more enjoyment on your second match as you have a better idea of what to do. It seemed best to us to simply race for 40 points. You give up so much by trying for any of the other conditions.

Perhaps I should find me an other opponent than my girlfriend to give this game another try, as the three games we played I tried the three different win conditions and easily managed to reach my goal each time, while I think it's actually hard to win occupying a whole temple and certainly occupying all yellow/green squares. Against an equally strong opponent it could become a real brain drainer to reach those 40 points first, though I'm afraid it may also become pretty straightforward, always using the same tactics (as long as the cards come more or less the way you want). But I might be wrong. It's certainly worth a few more tries to find out.

RATING: 7
Area majority games typically don't work very well with just two players. Aton, however, does. There is a constant trade-off between immediate victory points, board position beneficial for sudden death victory, and superior board position for more long-term goals.

Despite not having much of a theme, Aton isn't a pure abstract in the stricter sense. When things are coming to a head (and they will sooner or later) the card draws can often be decisive. There is some bluffing and guessing involved in figuring out what your opponent is planning this turn, too. And all of that fits comfortably inside of 20-30 minutes (and sometimes much less when taking your first unsteady steps).

You're basically playing the input to a finite state machine, but interestingly... it works!  The random deal is fun, but where it really gets interesting is in the variant where each player gets 1,2,3, and 4 each turn.  I've only played this variant a couple times, but I like it so far.

I really like the Egyptian-themed semi-abstract game going on here. This is actually a very fine two-player game. It is primarily an area control game with a very solid card system to take control over "seats" in the four "palaces". Games are usually very tight, with no player really knowing how it's going to turn out. Much is up to the card draw, but as each player has the same deck, the law of averages should even things out in one way or another. Reads like a convoluted scoring and placement game (the rules are actually terribly written - read an update here on the Geek) but this is actually a very simple game to play. As with all great abstracts, the rules are simple but the decisions always are tense and meaningful. Good show!

After 90 plays (I am currently the Aton leader on the Geek), I can only rave about this beautiful and innovative game.  Learning how to play my four cards to the four cartouches has been fun and satisfying...you've really got to be aware of the score, your opponent's cards, what temples each of you can play in that turn, what temples you can hope to control - so much in such an efficient system!  Aton is the game I most often play with my granddaughter Lacey, and she wins her share using a variety of strategies.

I'm still a little undecided on how good this game is.  It appears rather easy to defend against your opponent getting an instant victory on yellow or green or a full temple.  Since you can only remove one or two of their pieces per turn, it makes it hard to get victory in any of these ways.  Which means it degrades into yet another game of optimising how you get victory points compared with how efficiently your opponent can generate them.  Still, not a bad game.

Very quick game and really simple with some interesting choices to make, both in card selection and token placements/removal. My wife did not get the game at first so now that she understands it the game should be better the next time.

Really wanted to like this game. I love the threat of the early win condition. You always have to be wary that your opponent might try to go for an instant victory. Feels similar to the same mechanic in Attika. Most games don't end this way, but the threat of it will always influence how you play. 

In the end, though, Aton is just a bit too abstract for my tastes.

RATING: 8.25
Nice quick two player game. After loosing a game, one tends to say: "Best out of three?"

There's enough ways to victory to threaten an opponent in various ways. Most of the times you can do a good or a surprising thing with a hand of cards that at first looked like a bad hand.

Seven plays. I like the game, though I think they could have cut out a few of the rules. "Fill any temple" makes for a pretty good alternate victory condition, but "all green squares or all yellow squares" seems unnecessary. The game also feels like it wants to be a little longer. There's usually only two scoring rounds; it would be neat if a player who got way behind after the first scoring could switch to an alternate victory condition, but I'm not sure there's enough time to change gears like that.

Tremendous! This game delivers a huge punch and has set the bar for a 2 player abstract board game.

Q: "Tremendous!" you say, how so?

A: This is a tense game from the word go. Decisions can be agonizing, however, Aton does not seem to suffer from the dreaded AP disease. I attrubute this to the intuitive flow of the game, it gives you the decisions in small but rapid doses. A quick game in 15 minutes and a well thought out game in 30.

The hand management aspect drives the area majority aspect that can be steered towards one or more of the four different victory conditions. This game really feels like a quick and dirty duel.

I thought it would rock, but was actually a rather fiddly abstract that seemed like it was asking too much learning from me in order to actually be able to play well.  Maybe that's why I don't like abstracts very much.

RATING: 3
Irritating.  No hook to make the players interested in the outcome of the game.  The "theme" has no connection whatsoever to the mechanics of the game, and is thus worse than useless.  It would be a better game (though still not a good one) if it were published as a pure abstract, since that's what it is.

But it fails as an abstract, because with the six different ways of scoring, there's no intuitive mapping between the state of the board and the state of the game.  The shape of an abstract game should give some intuition of the state of the game, even (or perhaps especially!) if that intuition is wrong.  The visual intuition draws you into the game, and keeps it interesting.  Aton has no intuitive mapping.  If you weren't allowed to look at the score track, you'd have almost no idea what the state of the game was just by looking at the board.  Instead the designer relies on a score track, which here comes off as the game equivalent of "telling instead of showing" that signifies bad writing.

Blind bidding (albeit in a very restricted bidding space), and tit-for-tatism.  No heart.

A superb little tightrope walk of a game.

If you put Aton under a microscope it seems like it should be a Big Bag of Fail. The theme bears no real relation to mechanics (though it does give a nice graphic design to the components). The multiple ways of scoring are a bit overwhelming the first time you explain the rules to someone.

Really, this is just an abstract game just like any of the GIPF family.

But unlike most abstracts it has a bit of "colour" (much like Hive) that for some reason makes it more approachable and fun than something more nakedly geometric in styling.

As an additional bonus you can take it out of the Queen box and it packs down pretty small for travel; I took it to Bali on a recent vacation.

I also have some concerns about the power of the Temple 1 Rush Strategy, but I don't think Aton is the kind of game that will ever get an analysis proving or disproving it. But since my primary gaming partner doesn't hang out on BGG it isn't a problem in practice.

Reminds me of the sprint event in track cycling.  Early on both players can make whatever moves they like but once one player starts going for the very powerful Temple One Domination Strategy, the other player is forced to also spend significant effort on Temple One.  After that it's a wrestle to contain the other player & use any surplus actions to create a threat to the other player.  If the player going for the TODS doesn't have to fight against anything but Temple One they will almost always win the game ... so make sure you force them to defend somewhere else as well!

Little two-player games like this aren't always big favorites with me, and this one didn't seem too promising, especially since the rules were very poorly written and it was entirely unclear how the final two cartouches worked.

However, it turned out to be rather interesting.  I tend to like games where players can compete in multiple arenas at the same time, winning some and losing others. Plus, it's one of those strangest of all creatures, a two-player area control game.  

There are so many different ways to win that in the first game, my opponent didn't pay attention to all of them and lost because of it--so that felt a little unfair, but unlikely to happen with experienced players. In other situations, it just creates a lot of fires that must be attended to immediately.  Kind of like tic-tac-toe in that respect, but, you know, with a game attached to it. (2 plays)

Totally abstract game in which players have to be aware of many different scoring rules to play well. Once the scoring rules are clear, the game itself is simple and card play almost obvious. However, as the card play is the core of the game, there's just enough variations available to keep it interesting for such a short game.

My wife is enjoying this one. I'm not sold on it just yet. I keep thinking we are playing it wrong. Need to peruse the rules and forums a bit. Looking forward to playing it again though, especially as it is one my wife will request. Automatic 7 for now.

Turns out we were playing it wrong. After some rule clarifications and more plays, we are both enjoying this fast playing game. Still can't beat my wife at it though...

Although the theme is pointless, it looks great. The puzzle board is a great idea for keeping the box small. Could be a lot shallower though.

Gameplay is smooth and offers multiple paths to victory. Perfect two-player game that is quick and deep at the same time.

There is some solid decision making in assigning your numbers to the spaces.  The disc placement has moderately interesting choices at times.

It's really the lack of theme and rough rules about when the hell you reveal things.  I'll give it another go or two.

That was promising until I observed that it is too random.  Scoring at the end usually shows a huge gap beteen the winner and the loser.  You can also lose by bad luck in the midgame.
Simply - the cards you draw determine the outcome too much.  Of course each player has the same set of cards and the difference is _when_ each one draws which cards, but that's enough to create unacceptable randomness.  There are a few scorings during the game and that's why it's crucial to get good cards in a good moment.

RATING: 7
A fun fast little game of Area control for 2 players, the theme is a nice thought but a paste-on and not part of gameplay really. Make sure you have the rules right as there a couple that could be played wrong easily. 

Nice choices in the game and a fair amount to think about for a simple game. You need to keep your eye on several things like: 4 sudden death conditions (a little difficult to pull off but possible), black square majority, 4th temple majority/blue squares, bonus squares and majority in each temple. Nice multiple ways to score however it seems critical that you get at least 1 of the "big 2" (4th temple and black) or one player will come out way ahead and well onto his/her way to winning. 

Some luck in the cards but it usually balances out nicely as you still have choices on where your 4 cards are going giving you some control. One game did get decided by a really lucky draw right before the scoring however so hopefully that won't happen often. Anticipation of your opponents moves is especially important right before a scoring and choices get tougher here. 

A nice fast paced meaty game for 2 in about 20 - 25 minutes.

Update: 7.5 =>7 It seems to me the game needs a couple of tweaks for balancing and with them it is good little game.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2013)

I really liked Aton (area control game), the rules are simple and easy to teach, however there is tension and very interesting decisions outthinking your opponent. The game has some luck with the cards, but I got the feeling that the better player will win (often) regardless of luck. It plays very quickly. 

The game components and art are ok, I like the puzzle like game board that comes in a small box. 

On the bad side, the theme is very weak.

For now this is a keeper in my collection, I want to play it soon with Amy. With more plays this has the potential to go up in my ratings although it is a lighter game than I generally like.

I finally played the game with Amy and she liked it, however It´s been years since I last played it and I have changed a lot. Also Amy said it was an ok game but we have best two player games so I´m going to sell it.

The luck factor is not as small as I initially thought. You can discard your hand once in the game, but  if your opponent has a strong hand twice in the game and you a very weak hand twice in the game, it is very hard to recover. In short, luck can decide the winner of the match. 

Aton is a clever game, but the decisions aren’t as interesting as I remembered before. I crave heavier experiences.

Very solid two-player game. The rules alone suggest a rather dry majority game, but I didn't find the playing of it to be dry at all. There are interesting choices to be made in every phase, and the card play is not as limiting as it is with China. The cards guide gameplay, but don't dictate it. I can't think of a better majority game for two players.

Update years later: I still find this to be a "solid" two-player majority game, but my girlfriend disagrees that it doesn't feel dry. Maybe it is drier than I had thought. :-) With the recent publication of many great two player games, this doesn't quite hold up anymore.

I've played Aton 7 times this month, and I still can't decide if it's actually any good.

I'm half convinced that someone dared Thorsten Gimmler to design a game based on the number four. In Aton, two rival priesthoods position for control over four temples, which include spaces of four colors, by playing four cards face down, from a deck of cards valued 1-4. Admittedly, this is a touch absurd on the surface, but it just might work. The game's strong suit is its pacing. Turns go by very quickly as players allocate their cards to four "cartouches." The first cartouche is a benchmark of sorts, a quick hit of VPs that often carries a stiff opportunity cost in board position. The other three cards follow a simple "when, where, how many" schema, determining turn order, board access, and board strength. Will you play first, where will you play, and how strongly will you play there? Those are the questions the players answer repeatedly until a winner is determined.

The four temples scale approximately in scoring potential, though the rules for each is different. Temple four can easily yield 9 or 12 points during a scoring round (game ends when someone reaches 40), but requires the highest card just to access, whereas temple one usually only yields a couple of points but can be accessed with any card. It's an interesting balance. The temples also include two types of spaces that score independently, creating a second layer of positioning between the players. If that weren't enough for a 20-30 minute game, there are three ways to 'shoot the moon' in Aton, though in practice they are quite easy to stop and simply aren't realistic paths to victory. That's not to say they don't add to the game, though, because they do allow players to create pressure points and force their opponents to respond. Lastly, players drive the timing of scoring rounds, which lends the game much-needed subtlety.

Sometimes, Aton can feel obvious. Other times, it feels as though drawing high cards at an especially crucial moment is more important that consistently good play. Those concerns haven't managed to put me off yet, though. Recommended.

Aton often is judged as an abstract which in my opinion is done mistakenly. It has a noticeable random factor introduced by the card draws and the hidden card placement - both factors that don't have a place in true abstracts and place Aton in the strategy game category of BGG. I understand though where this judgement stems from. Aton is a themeless assembly of mechanisms, victory conditions and various ways to score. All of this works together fluidly, leaves enough food for thought and has replay value. While I can enjoy abstracts and don't mind Aton's abstract nature, Aton doesn't get me. It's a game I more respect for its fine-tuned design rather than I enjoy playing it.

This gets high marks from me as 2p game for three reasons. First, there are 7 paths to victory so there are many strategies to consider. Second, there is a lot of player interaction. Every strategy needs to be balanced against what your opponent is doing. Third, you can play this in as little as ten minutes, and best of three in half an hour. Putting all three of these together means Aton has earned a permanent place in my collection. One of my favorite closers on a 2p game night.

Loving this nice little 2-p game.  So many choices.  What is my best choice?  What will my opponent do?  Do they have the cards necessary to thwart my plan?

A solid 2-player game that seems to me nicely balanced. All the conditional rules and elements were a little fiddly at first, but it quickly made a sort of sense and just streamlined itself. Deceptively simple, but there's some nice decisions to be made here, and it plays quickly. Many of the elements feel well designed and considered.

Update: hmm...flaws become evident with more plays. Just in the sense that certain things should never be pursued, it's hard for the losing player to catch up, and it plays TOO quickly...

Based on the game's size and its profile on BGG, I expected Aton to be a light filler game for 2 players. However, when I read the rules I panicked. There were 4 win conditions; the 4 cartouche phases were interdependent and confusing; and there were like a half dozen or more ways to score. The game didn't seem light at all. I was seriously worried that game play would be halting because of frequent rules lookups, which was not what I wanted. The game was actually deceptively simple and played quickly. It took just a few rounds of our first game before we had it completely down. We were flipping cards and placing and removing counters with ease. But don't be fooled. This simple game is packed with strategy. This might be my new go-to 2-player filler.

Another game that is trying to compete with the famous KOSMOS collection. This game is all about blind bidding, with a hint of control. Being a big fan of control I didn%u2019t appreciate having to guess on a lot of occasions. The rules seem to be too complicated for what they are trying to do, although the game provides a player with multiple different strategies for winning. Over all 2 stars, if you are looking for your first good two player game this is not it, but this might be one that you would like to add to your collection.

Interactive quick 2 player game. This one begs for more plays as there are tons of different paths of victory to be explored. This game seems very dependent on your opponent as what they are trying to accomplish severely alters your line of play. I do wish the first to 40 points win condition was a little better thought out. The only game I played devolved into a top deck war with the first player to miss on a 4 losing. I'm sure tighter play makes this a non-issue.

Quick but deep two-player game in which you simultaneously decide how to assign the four numbered cards you get each turn to the four actions you have to do. The main goal is to build up majorities of pieces in the four temple areas, and the actions allow you to add your pieces, remove your opponent's pieces or take points. Add some alternative winning conditions and you get a sophisticated game, a little dry but made fun by the quick pace of play.

Got this off the prize table at BGG.CON 2009.  The back of the box looks so uninteresting that I almost left it in the hotel room with PisserWizzer or WizzerButter or BezzerWizzer or whatever it was.  But reading the rules on the plane, I'm thinking I may like this.

Update: I do like this a lot.  My only complaint is that the positions of the 2nd & 3rd cartouches should have been switched on the board.  I like Battle Line a little more in the 30-minute 2-player space, but this is good.

This game is "broken" in my opinion in that it is a fight for temple 1.  Any of the other strategies are just not as good as trying to fill temple 1, which causes the other player to have to fill temple 1 also and then it comes down to luck in who wins.  This works perfectly because it's the best thing to do to use your highest card for number of pieces placed and  your lowest card for the temples you want to place in.  There's just no other better strategy.

RATING: 9
Every moment designed for confrontation.  Every action an action taken to inflict pain on your opponent.  Aton is bare knuckle fighting, a punch to the gut.

Fundamentally abstract, the theme is used as a means to organise gameplay rather than enhance or cushion the assault.  Competition is ever present in boardgames but confrontation is often side-stepped or diluted.  In contrast, Aton through the card play which drives the area majority battles is raw in-your-face confrontation.

However, as in life you cannot go out and hurt an opponent without consequences.  Each action has a positive and negative result.  Combined with the anguish in trying to predict your opponents move, do you gamble on certain cards, this is a fantastic attack on your cognitive powers.

After more games the sweet science of Aton becomes more apparent.  Beautifully balanced, beautifully constructed this game which lacks the fanfare of others is one of the surprise hits of recent years for me.

Minor note - beautiful box insert, thumbs up for Queen games for going the extra mile.

Great little 2-player area control game with multiple ways to score (although it seems you need to pick more than one to win). Unique game-play mechanisms in the card management and play of them during the turn. Easy to learn (it is not as complicated as the rules make it seem at first) and plays quickly. Recommended and Significant Other Friendly.

Abstracty goodness! The rules/iconography are pretty obtuse, but a couple of rounds into the game all becomes clear. Thematically the game is supposed to be about the fight between the Egyptian worship of the old gods and the new religion, worshiping Aton. Umm, nope! It's just an excuse to bid for spots and push little circles into square grids. Many different ways to win and collect points keeps this one interesting and engaging. It is also short enough to play a few games in an hour's time. Traded to Dennis Murray

Super weird abstract game with an interesting concept but poor execution. Given its nearly top 500 rank I expected better.

----------

Turns out we had three rules wrong:

1. All 8 cards are revealed simultaneously.

2. The player with the lower cartouche 2 value plays his entire round (removing and adding discs) before the other player acts.

3. Both players remove discs in cartouche 2, not just the first player. This changes the dynamic of the game completely. Must replay and rate again.

06/26/06 Received. The more I play it the more depth and strategy I see in it. I like that there are several ways to win. So one must guard against them all. The only thing I don't like is the usual with Queen; their stupid "tall for no good reason" boxes. It makes them unwieldy to carry.  
As to the two white Exchange counters, the rules do not indicate how to show when its been used by a player. So I pasted "used" on one side and instruct opponents to turn it over to that side when they use its mulligan effect.  
As of 06/25/17 I've played 47 games, winning 34 (72.3%).

RATING: 9
For fans of abstract games, Aton is a real treat because it offers two things that other abstracts cannot: 1) multiple ways to win. Think about a game chess where you are trying to trap an opponent between two pieces, here you trap them in between two types of impending ending conditions. 2) simultaneous planning.  It works wonderfully in wargames, and it works in this type of abstract as well.  It feels clunky at first, but once you get it up to speed its a fine machine.

Elegant 2-player area control game with multiple paths to victory and multiple ways to score.  Each player has a deck of cards valued 1-4.  You draw 4 cards and place those values on 4 different slots.  Each slot does something different but they do interact with each other.  The genius is that each slot seems to be equally important making for some tough decisions.  Somewhat dry but plays quickly.

Despite the gaps in the rule book which leave some crucial questions about the game unanswered, this is a fine abstract game, albeit one which has not grabbed my imagination.

It's not stunningly original or revolutionary, but Aton does that whole "area majority with clever scoring" thing very well. The rules are simple, and while there doesn't seem to be much in the way of deep strategy, card assignment offers plenty of scope for agonising tactical decisions. All in all, the game feels polished: it lacks that annoying clutter of extra detail that's often unsuccessfully used to make a small game seem bigger. Aton has a nice flow and it moves at a brisk pace, it's quick to set up and get playing. I guess it would be an ideal cafe game.

Update Jan 07: Aton just seems to get better and better. Heck, I'll push my rating up to nine!

First impression: Aton is a very abstract. Most of games symbols are clear but at least there really should be a reminder for 8 pts for black majority. Couple others could be clearer. Not much of a issue if you play regularly but I know this is one of those games I surely won't be playing too often. Scoring has several things you need to be aware of all the time. 

There are 4 ways to have sudden death ending of the game. I like these sudden endings as you can try to aim for one of them or simply force you opponent to make slightly non-optimal moves to prevent you from getting too good position on board.

I sort of like most elements and mechanics there are in the game. The game is ok but it is totally abstract and I'm not convinced that you have enough control with your moves. You always draw 4 cards and can choose in which "order" you play them. This doesn't give enough options IMO. I wasn't enjoying the game enough and traded it away.

Aton isn't very innovative - it oozes Knizia influence every way you look at it: both players have an identical pack of cards out of which they draw four each round, these cards are placed in four slots determining how many pieces are going to be placed and removed from four temples, and after some rounds of placing and removing a scoring takes place.

That said, Aton works as a light but still solid tactical game: the play is quickly assimilated and smooth, there are several ways to win and just the right touch of randomness.

Too short would be my major whinge. Not enough time to develop a long term strategy, and the game could easily have been made that crucial bit longer - say to 50 points rather than 40. The theme is blatantly (almost offensively) pasted on, and perhaps there's one option too many. But Aton still garners its marks from some of the best, most intense competition ever seen over a 2-player table.

Excellent 2 player area control game. Very nice cards (small "euro" size) and clear rules, the board is one of those jigsaw puzzle affairs but quite small so it rarely gets disrupted.
Gameplay is quick, and the fundamental mechanism  is original. Each player has their own deck of forty cards, ten each of value one, two, three and four. Hands of four cards are drawn and played each round. The cards are assigned to four sequential actions which have different board effects. Higher numbered cards are better, but rarely do you get a hand that is all high cards, so the skill is in reading the board and the opponent, to see where the cards will get the best payoff.
Aton is a fine game, different to most others.

[i]Wow; it took Mat an I over an hour, including two restarts, to get a game in mostly do to some ambiguous rules. I am glad I got the chance to play, but Aton is not a game for me. After seeing it posted in multiple threads as a great 2p area control game I almost picked it up, but after playing this game fell off my wishlist. I found Aton to be too abstract and the scoring is just convoluted enough to make it seemingly complex and difficult to teach (when in reality it's not). I think calling it an area control game is a stretch, it doesn't offer the same kind of experience that you get from El Grande or Triassic Terror, it is so dry and procedural that it feels like the fun was sucked right out of it.

A really pleasant light abstract that zips along without too much ansgt but produces some interesting choices on whether to attack or defend various parts of the board. Every hand provides a nice decision point. The thing that keeps attracting me back to the game, despite it's abstractness, is that there are a number of ways to win. If you find yourself falling behind on the score track, you can switch tactics and go all out to either dominate 1 area or 1 of the colours, catching your opponent (who was merrily cruising to the finish line) unawares. So there's a constant fear and alertness generated because the game can suddenly change, together with the role of the defender. There's enough luck in the cards each turn to make life interesting, the decision being how best to use them (and whether they encourage you to switch strategies). Lots of decent decisions to make throughout without it ever bogging down because with only 4 cards to lay against the 4 actions, the turns are pacy and it comes in at the right length of 15-20 minutes.

I was very disappointed with this game. It looked nice, as I read the rules I figured it was a nice game until I actually played it! There is not much range to plan things.

After multiple years it comes back into the collection again. I like abstract games enough for me to give it another go. Going to trust Hall9000 on this...

 Not as good as our other 2 player game by Queens, Roma, but a quick and not too brain burning filler for 2 players only. Make sure you get the rules correct or you will be saying 'this is broken/boring'. Took us a while to figure out the details from the rule book which is a bit opaque on important aspects of turn order/scoring. At first we were scoring at the end of every round and wondering why the 'trail of the dead' track didn't fill up. I've come to realize I'm not crazy about 'abstract' games. They just don't get my imagination going, and that's what I want when I play games.

It's quite difficult to create an engaging area control game for two players, but Aton does just that.  There are a number of different approaches that you can take to the game, forcing players to be aggressive and defensive at different points.  Simultaneous card play keeps both players guessing, and while there is some luck with card draws, it balances out as you make your way through the deck.

Decent abstract game of using cards 1-4 in four different spots to score points, remove markers, select the temple and place markers.  I liked the different ways to arrange the outcomes and the different paths to victory by points or covering green/yellow squares.  Game played quickly and easy to learn.  I can see this being cutthroat with similar skilled players.

The game was decent, however didn't blow me away.  Many times the card arrangement had few decisions/obvious arrangement as well as the actions were semi-obvious.  Game had some fiddly rules about card placement actions and temple scoring.

It was fine for what it was, but just one week later, I can barely remember anything about it. I guess that means it was forgettable. Not bad, mind you , but nothing stood out.

RATING: 8
Very under-rated game. This is a wonderful little abstract duel whose rules seem weird and tricky until you play a game and realize they're actually incredibly simple - it's just that a few of the steps in a turn are inter-related, so for instance, what you bid for your 3rd step affects the location where you'll carry out both your second step and fourth step (hence all four bids are revealed before either player proceeds in each round) 

Once you figure out that the 1st step is a simple bidding duel, the second step is bidding for turn order (but penalizes dysfunctional behavior of always bidding the lowest), the third step is bidding on flexibility of where you can attack and build, and the fourth is powering up your build/attack... then it all makes sense.

If you like a good abstract game, (Duke, Yinsh, Onitama) you'll like this Consider the theme to be merely cool artwork which adorns the board and enjoy the game.

Aton is a game that has been dumped by Queen Games, which made the expactations were low. On the other hand, the average rating is 7.00 (01/09/2013), which is rather good. I think 7 is indeed the perfect score for this game. It's a good game, but won't overwhelm you with excitement.

You can tell this is an older game. Maybe I just didn't get it. I did really like the simultaneous card allocation but after that the game just seemed like a race (to lose in my case).

Aton is one of those games I've known the name of for years but didn't really know much about. It turned out to be a delightful surprise, and I played it six times in two days. A quick and highly confrontational 2p area-control game with player-driven timing and multiple victory conditions. My more experienced opponent beat me handily the first few times, but the last couple of games were brilliantly knife-edge affairs. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Might be rated higher with more non-teaching plays.  There are several things going on each turn and the first game for a player may be unfulfilling.  Each player is drawing cards from their own (identical) decks, so it becomes an exercise in using the four cards that you get each turn.  Lots of second guessing opponent needed to do well.

= 2013-01-03 - R: 7

Played 2.5 times so far. The first time was a practice run to get the rules down. After the first scoring, the points were pretty lopsided so we didn't bother finishing. Two days later, we played our first full game. My wife's strategy was to take over the whole 1st temple. I didn't even notice she was doing it until she had all but three of the spots (bad play on my part). I spent the rest of the game trying to keep her from getting those last three. She never got the whole temple, but she killed me in points. Last night we played our second full game. She tried to go after green squares but in the process let me get all four blue squares and a majority of the blacks. After our first scoring, I was past 40 points.

Most reviews for this game say that points are really the only way to win, with the other means of victory mostly just there to make sure you're paying attention. I'm hoping the game can continue to be fun once we abandon attempts at direct victory by dominating a color or temple.

So far, a very fun game and one of the few my wife has requested twice in a row. Starting out at a 7.

This is quite good for what it is: A very fast 2 player game with more strategy than luck but enough luck to cause a late game upset if someone gets enough momentum. 

Normally that extra little bit of luck would bother me but with a nice fast game like this it doesn't. Besides that there are strategies by which you can adapt to that luck. 

Very enjoyable game!

I had very high hopes for this game back in 2011, from the reviews I'd read - but came away disappointed once I'd got my hands on it. It's a good game, but I'm not excited by it, and it doesn't seem to have the tension of frequent agonising decisions that I thought it would. (Not that I'm saying most decision are obvious - they're not - it's just that I don't feel that engaged by any of them.) I got this game for Christmas 2011, we played a few times then, and perhaps once or twice more in early January - but not at all since, and I can't see it getting any more play in the near future either. Certainly not a bad game, but not sufficiently interesting when there are many great games around. And especially when I now prefer longer and more complex games as a general rule.

Drawing four cards, assigning them slots that give you different benefits, and then placing discs on a board. If this sounds fun to you, Aton is a non-stop roller coaster thrill ride of excitement! Thankfully, like most rollercoasters, it doesn't last very long. I don't think it's a bad game, it's just a bland one that does nothing for me. So it's a bad game for me. It might not be bad for you!

(+) Innovative card-pool and bluffing mechanisms that dictate your actions and your opponents. Manipulate turn order or monopolize power: the question is, when?  
(+) Encourages avenues of double-think that keep you invested in another players turns.  
(+) Control of the board state can be influenced through smart cardplay and can win you back majority in areas.  

(-) Somewhat non-intuitive ruleset. Scoring did not seem very clear at the outset.  
(-) Low in excitement.  
(-) Lacking in strategic depth. It is mainly a game about tactics, action, and reaction.

RATING: 10
Wife friendly, fun-filled extravaganza. With 4 ways to win, and a rather large selection of ways to score, this game is never going to be the same game twice, unless someone finds that their strategy is a good one. But that being said, if you put all your eggs in one basket you will not win. A variety of scoring techniques will be needed to win, if anything, a smart player would play at least two strategies in order to confuse the opponent while securing the win. The large set of options are very easy to figure out, and within 2 rounds anyone will have figured out the placements/removals. It takes only one scoring round to figure that out, so within the first 5 minutes you should have a complete understanding of the techniques that are used. I enjoy playing this "short" game. This and Roma are the best 2 player games this year for me. Queen are on a role with the small box sized games as of late. Not sure about before this year, because Inka didn't fair too well over here. Overall, a great game for 2 players. Upped the rating. This game has everything I want in a single setting for two players. Every game has been nail biting at least for half the game if not more. I've won using all the ways to win except for filling an entire temple

RATING: 7
i really like this - i love the different ways to win aspect and the tactical nature of the card play means you never spend TOO long thinking about things. i can see this getting a lot of play. 

my only concern is that luck in the card draw may occasionally decide a game (especially after reshuffling the decks) but the exchange counter does mitigate this somewhat.

Seems to be holding up OK to multiple plays, and seems like a very solid two-player.

I played 5 times on the day I learned this game from Łukasz and Browarion. Quick and addictive. I like that there are various victory paths. The luck of the tile draws is a little annoying, but at least there's the one-time mulligan to get rid of a terrible draw. I want to play more.

Unfortunately the English rules are confusing, and there is a FAQ with (apparently) answers from the publisher which directly contradict the rules in at least 2 places.

A game of majorities that works fine with two.  Nevertheless, I believe that with more players it would gain in depth and tension.

Nagyon jó kis kétszemélyes játék. Full absztrakt az egyiptomi körítés bármi más is lehetne. A játékosoknak fejenként 4 1-4 értékben levő lapot kell minden körben négy helyre elosztaniuk. Az első mezőre, aki nagyobbat tesz, a két lap különbsége*2 győzelmi pontot kap. A másik három helyre letett lap jelzők leszedését és felrakását hívatott jelezni. Minél nagyobbak az idetett lapok annál több jelzőt tudunk ellenfelünktől leszedni és mi annál többet felrakni és annál magasabb szintű templomba. Adott számú jelző lekerülése után egy értékelés zajlik a templombokban levő többségek után jár különböző pont.
Egyszerű, nagyon ötletes játék az Aton. Nekem a Rosenköniget juttatta eszembe, annál kicsit összetettebb, de a szerencsefaktora semmivel sem kisebb. Nagyon sok múlik a lapok feljövetelén, meglátásom szerint a játék azon múlik, hogy az értékelések előtt kinek szerencsésebbek a felhúzott lapjai. Gyors, pörgős játék, ezért több is lejátszható egymás után. Ajánlott kategória.

UPDATE: Moving up to a 9, because it plays so fast and has so many interesting choices.  A wonderful two-player.

very stressful abstract game with agonizing decisions at every turn. it's tug-of-war-ish which is a mechanism that really appeals to me. this is the kind of game i love.... one that seems fun to explore over many, many plays. i also appreciate the multiple end-game conditions - makes strategy even more tricksy. will be playing this one a lot for sure. bonus - i got this for practically free!

Solid two player game with good replayability.  Anyone that thinks that there is a dominant strategy, must be playing with someone who is allowing them to pursue it, unheeded.  Moves quick with nice decisions, and I don't have another game like it.

Superb two player light strategy game with multiple victory paths. Appreciation of strategy builds after a few plays which is indicative of the sort of game we like. My wife was impressed with the quality of the graphics, components and box insert and said the game has a nice atmosphere. We like the little extra once only 'card re-draw' (mulligan) mechanic to compensate for a really bad hand.

An interesting area-control game for two. The only randomness occurs in the order the cards come up. Over the course of the game, though, you'll go through your entire deck (and then some) so you should both see roughly the same cards ... eventually. But each hand is interesting as you try to figure out what your opponent will do, and where you should play your cards. Lots of tension but the game plays quite quickly -- looking forward to more games!

The board shows 4 temples (1, 2, 3, 4) each with 12 spaces in various colors (yellow, green, black, 1 blue each, some uncolored with +1 or +2). Each player has an identical deck of cards (9 sets of 1, 2, 3, 4) which are shuffled separately. Players draw a hand of 4 cards and simultaneously play them face-down to 4 spaces (1, 2, 3, 4), then reveal all cards. Resolve them in order:
1. Higher card scores VP = 2 x (difference in card values)
2a. Lower card resolves 2-4 first; if tied, lower #1 card; if that's tied, flip cards from deck till break tie.
2b. Remove (Card - 2) of opponent's tokens from temples numbered < Card played in 3 spot. If you played a 1 (1-2 = -1), remove one of your own. All removed tokens go to Kingdom of the Dead track (space for 8 tokens).
3. Determines which temples are legal plays for steps 2 and 4; temples numbered the same as or less than the card you play here are legal.
4. Place Card Value tokens in legal temples (determined by card in 3 spot).

If Kingdom of Dead full, score:
- each temple scores differently, with player with more tokens there earning VP
- player with more black squares occupied gets 8 VP
- all players score for bonus squares (+1 and +2)

You win if you occupy all 12 spots in any temple, all yellow spots, all green spots, or if someone gets past 40 VP (most VP wins).

RATING: 6
Difficult to decide between a 6 or 7.  The deciding factor is when I see the game on the shelf as a possibility, I think "it's not bad, but i there anything else?"  I do like it, but it's a little dry to rank as a great game.  It's also one of those games that almost fit the bill to play with my wife if it didn't hve one or two too many rules to remember.

Wide but not deep strategy--tactical with some strategic elements.  30 minutes for a game seems on high side, our games run about 20--typically 3 to 4 in about an hour.  The fun lies in the number of avenues there are to win, but each turn's decision-making is quite fast.  Reminds me a little of Lost Cities in that ease of decision-making while still retaining the pressure and "tenseness" of having to watch several routes to victory.

Upping the rating to 8.5 after more plays with different opponents...now at 9!

RATING: 7
[Queens Game Multi-lingual 06 edition] {Egypt, couple; area-control, programming} Aton is an abstract tactical game for 2 players. It's fast-paced and interactive (with light confrontation).  A typical game runs around 30 minutes, which is very reasonable.  Most decisions are confined by the 4 cards drawn but players still could react to different situations.  It provides (so-called) multiple winning paths for players.  These multiple winning goals drive player to pay more attention; otherwise, they will miss intrigues that their opponent is planning.  So far, the usual winning condition is the 40 points. I can see the potential of winning by exclusively controlling a temple but I doubt the possibility of winning through controlling * all * yellow / green places.

The game system works and is effective, although I think it's not elegant.  The alternative winning goals seem to be crafted in a way that players still have choices to make even with bad hands.  However, these choices do not integrate with the theme well and feel like artificial. 

I like the Egyptian illustration.  I wish the publisher provided wooden pawns rather than counters to represent the priests.

Excellent short 2-player area majority game. Attractive Egyptian artwork, but essentially abstract. Potential score/add/remove opponent actions dictated by drawing 4 random cards from personal card deck, albeit with once-per-game re-draw mechanism. Four ways to win, though realistically one plus 3 "gotcha" victory conditions.

[gameid=19999] is a game set in Ancient Egypt. Players compete for dominance and the right to decide the proper Gods of Egypt - Aton or Amon. There are 4 tempels in the game and each is fiercely contested. Multiple ways may lead to victory for you, one of which is to be the first to 40 points.

Each player is given a deck of 36 cards. Each round you draw 4 cards and place them, one by each of the 4 cartouche. Each card has a value of 1 to 4. The way you place cards determine various factors. 

The first cartouche awards the player with the greater value twice the difference between the players in VP, while the second cartouche determines who goes first, lowest number wins, however, it has a double meaning. The value of the card played also determines if you get to remove 1 or 2 of your opponents stones or 1 of your own - a 2 does neither. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest value on the first cartouche wins.

The third cartouche determines which temples a player can add stones to from temple 1 to 4 and finally the fourth cartouche determines how many stones can be added.

Opponents stones (or the one of your own) are removed first, then you add your new stones. Any removed stones are placed in the Kingdom of the Dead. If the Kingdom of the Dead is full at the end of a round a scoring round is triggered. Once scoring is complete, each player withdraws 4 stones, preferably from all temples, or from the highest numbered.

The game is an abstract game with a theme that works reasonably well, but it just did not click for us. There is a lot of jockeying for positions. Do you ensure you go first at the expense of not removing any of your opponents stones? Do you play the value 4 card you drew in the fourth cartouche, but then only have a 2 for the third? Decisions are tough at times.

There is a lot of luck in the draw of the cards, though you have one "get out of jail" card that can be played once only - allowing you to discard and draw new cards. You can be royally screwed with a hand of 3x 1 and 1x 4 - where do you place the 4? Or you can have an abundance of riches, but no place to put them.

I can appreciate the depth of gameplay, I can even overlook the luck of the draw, but, without being able to point my finger at it, there is something that rubs me the wrong way. Perhaps it is the abstract nature of it. I feel no attachment to the game or the battles taking place.

I have a very hard time visualizing the optimum paths to take, where to squeeze, bluffing your opponent, seizing on an oversight - perhaps it is because I just plain stink at it.

It sat on the shelf for a long time from a trade.  Then, the game took a few tries to find our zone.  But suddenly, something magical happened.  My wife said, "I think I like this one!"  The rounds go quicker and quicker and the down time is minimal as it is almost simultaneous placement.  It is actually an abstract that my wife enjoys.  

Reviewers are correct, you don't really feel the theme much, but I love the tensions and the quick gameplay.  There's also a "sneak" win element if you suddenly fill a temple, green zone, yellow zone or get 40 points.  There are always great choices in this game.

Great play balance here, and the decision of where to place your high and low cards can be difficult. Unfortunately, the decisions about where to add or remove tokens are pretty obvious, making at least half the actions in this game pretty routine. Not sure this is interesting, varied or involved enough to stand up to many plays, but as a very occasional dish in my two-player diet, Aton may stay on the menu for a while.

Only played a few times so far, but this game is incredible. A fast-playing two player game that has multiple paths to victory.

The strategy unfolds more and more as game after game. You can try going for points, but if your opponent gets ahead in points you may want to switch to trying to fill up the yellow spaces. Once your opponent catches on and tries blocking you, you can switch to trying to fill up a temple. Lots to consider on the offensive and defensive sides.

Update: Still love this game after some more plays. I think it should be part of any two-player game collection.

Update again: Played for the first time in a looong time and it's still a 10. I have to say it seems like the rulebook may be keeping it from being more highly regarded, because the gameplay is incredibly solid. The rulebook is just really unfortunate. Lots of ambiguities, and there's even an FAQ that doesn't cover all of the poorly written rules. After reading the FAQ and scouring the forums, I'm pretty confident that I play it correctly, but it took a lot of work to get to that point. Even though the rulebook needs a complete overhaul and you have to work to play it correctly, this game is still well worth the effort.

Excellent little game for 2 players. There are multiple paths to victory (or sudden death) that you need to be continually monitoring (or suffer the consequences). Innovative use of cards to determine in which temple you can play and to what extent. Extremely confrontational - as all good two player games should be.

10 plays: Have downgraded the rating by a point to 7. This is probably a bit unfair. I don't seem to get this game and end up losing a lot by missing one of the many paths to instant victory pursued by my opponent. I'm probably taking my lack of adeptness out on the game.
20 plays: Have now downgraded to 6. I guess the abstract nature of the game is getting to me.
30 plays: I've come to realise that the game has a significant flaw, in that it is always more efficient to play in Temple 1 and that the best strategy for winning is to try to dominate that temple. While not a guaranteed win, I've won in excess of 80% of recent games taking this approach. Perversely, this flaw has rekindled some of my interest in playing as I'm interested in seeing if the Temple 1 approach can be effectively countered. Rating stays at 6 (but would have been downgraded except for this recent interest).

This is one of those games where there are many ways to score and each of those ways are usually decided by one move.  That plus the pre-programmed actions makes me feel a bit like it's all one giant crap-shoot.  If the game weren't so short I'd be bothered, but it is and I enjoy area-majority games so this is a winner for me.

Update: Still like this, but it can cause a bit of anxiety for me. Soooo many possibilities!



Suitability for Travel:

Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1

The cleverness of the design impresses me.  Still getting the feel of good strategy.  Hopefully, it will hold my interest for a bit.  I'm unsure if this will be a game that will really shine with more games against a single opponent as the guessing game begins, or will come down to a single strategy or who gets the cards.  Too soon to tell and I'm enjoying finding out.

I do think the game would shine with repeat play against a similar opponent, but my quality opponent is sour on the game so this tight combination of area majority for 2 will be regulated to the closet most of the time.

Quite impressed and blown away by this neat gem by Thorsten Gimmler. Very well designed and well balanced two player game that is definitely up there in terms of achieving a delicate balance between playing time and complexity. The game is a simple area majority mechanic limited by card play selection. Using a simple combination of number cards, Gimmler is forcing players to tackle three fronts, short term gains for points, long term planning to acquire area majority scoring and playing defensively to thwart opponents from pursuing instant win strategies. It is the latter strategy that makes the game tense and shine. By constantly making players weigh the need for playing defensively, the game see-saws back and forth between winning points from planning ahead while keeping your opponents in check to prevent a sudden victory. The tension is palpable and the decision to sacrifice one card selection over the next each round is agonizing . The play time is reasonable and while the theme is primarily abstract, I did feel somewhat like an Egyptian god fighting over control of puny mortals to win the influence of temples. Currently this is one of the best two player games in this category of games with similar length and complexity (more along the lines of the Kosmos two player series rather than Twilight Struggle).

Luck of the draw is too high for me.  There is no mitigating hand management.  A bad hand will be "mitigated" later in the game by a good hand but the timing of hands is way too important for this to be a real mitigation.  A bad hand on the turn before a scoring round is deadly.  A bad hand when you are trying to go for an instant win condition sets you back multiple turns.

I was initially attracted to this game for the alternate win conditions.  I thought this would create some interesting, nuanced, and flexible play.  In reality the instant win conditions require your full concentration and abandonment of scoring to win.  And even then the conditions are very difficult to meet and incredibly easy to disrupt.

This game has some interesting concepts and a neat tug of war but needed way more time in the oven.  Undercooked.  If less points were available for scoring and the game lasted another round or two, the instant win conditions would be more viable but the game would also severely outstay it's welcome.

Not good.  Not fun, and not tense.  The two plays I both played were decided on good or bad draws just before the scoring round.  There's very little way to mitigate the randomness.  Accusations of degenerate strategy from more experienced players don't make me any more likely to try this one again.  At least the game is fast, but I don't think it's worth  playing when there are better fast two-player games out there.

A fine game with good mechanics. Very playable. All game actions are strategic. Better markers/tokens would improve the presentation but that applies to most games.

Rather simple rule set, but interesting game decisions to be made throughout.   Bit abstract, but that's OK with me.

Очень хорошая игра для двоих. Очень.
Последнее время часто сталкиваюсь с корявым изложением правил. Здесь в смысле методики все ОК, но при переводе с немецкого на англ. кое-где допустили разночтения и непонятки. С помощью разъяснялок здесь на BGG все быстро встает на места. Оценка возможно могла бы увеличиться, если бы важность третьего храма немного приподнять как-то. Но все равно налицо сбалансированность виктори-кондишенов и промежуточных скорингов. Потребуется еще практики, чтобы в некоторых ситуациях принимать более осмысленные решения при размещении четырех карт.

Может быть... может быть Долину Царей я сделал бы чуть длинней (на 2-4 поля), чтобы можно было чуть оттянуть факт очередного скоринга игроку, уступающему в счете, но претендующему на создание к-л позиции под victory condition №№2-4).

Based on one play, it's an odd, but solid little abstract.

One of the deeper 2-players. Not as quick as some others. Seems pretty unforgiving and a fair amount of luck. Still manages to ignite some tension though.

This game is a little unlike anything else I've played before.  It has elements of games I've played before, but everything comes together in a way that's very different.  The heart of the game is in the way you play your cards, but the board is where everything balances out as far as scoring goes.  The different ways that one can win keeps you on your toes, as you don't want your opponent to get too far ahead in any one of those ways.  The strategies aren't necessarily apparent, which makes me think that the game is more tactical, but that's not a bad thing.  It was just different from what I was expecting.  I think that wargamers would enjoy it, but it's best to understand that there will come a point in the game where your opponent has a game-winning move, and there's nothing you can do to stop them.  The race to that point is pretty interesting, though.

Ένα καλό, μάλλον abstract θα έλεγα, μικρό κουτί της Queen όπου προσπαθείς να πάρεις πλειοψηφία σε 4 ναούς και ο πρώτος που θα φτάσει τους 40 πόντους κερδίζει ή εναλλακτικά αν θα καταλάβει όλες τις θέσεις ενός ναού ή όλα τα κίτρινα ή πράσινα τετράγωνα όλων των ναών (αρκετά δύσκολο).

Played this a few times and liked it a great deal.  A tricky little balance of power / occupation game, but not a wargame.  A rare balance in a 2 player game between building your own positions and attacking your opponent's.  The victory conditions are difficult to grasp at first, and some elements are clearly well-calibrated points-balancers, but it still works nonetheless.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but probably not one I'd pull out to play very often.  The gameplay was quick, but it felt almost too quick.  Both my opponent and I were able to rack up over 40 points after only two scoring rounds, and I would have liked the game to have gone on a little bit longer.  Also, I felt like the actions really should have had a better graphic representation on the gameboard.  Things weren't always intuitive when looking at the iconography on the board (resolving cartouches), and some actions/scoring (scoring black spaces in temples, bonus spots) weren't even shown at all on the board.

Light 2 player filler.   Straightfoward to play,  a bit "on rails" (you draw 4 cards numbered 1-4 which determine where you can place,  and how many you place with) with a one-time mulligan.  (Actually played in teams of 2 since we had 4 people).  Pretty much a complete abstract though.

This is a nice looking, fairly quick to play 2 player game. A neat mechanic of having only 4 different cards - all being best played in more than one place. I really like it.

This one left me pretty cold.  Kind of dull and uninteresting, with mechanisms that have all been done before.  Add to that a fair amount of luck in the card distribution, and it just didn't do it for me.

Initial Impressions: This is a nice little 2-player game.  There is definitely pre-planning involved, as well as some opponent screwage.  It plays incredibly quickly, and we really enjoy it.  When it gets played, we usually end up playing 3 or so games.

I love the many choices and decisions of your card-placing and the winning conditions. It feels like a good game of chess with easier rules, lower strategy level and deep beauty in it!

I enjoy this game quite a bit.  I've had huge success playing it before / after Sunday school.

The interesting game play keeps me and others coming back.

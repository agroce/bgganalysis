GAME: Moderne Zeiten
RANK: 3715
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Moderne Zeiten failed to make a positive impression on me in several games with four or five players shortly after it was published.  While there were interesting elements like the stockmarket crash and Tutankhamen-esque progression along a track, the game didn't seem to hang together.  It felt like there was too little control and that the advantage to the player who ended the game was too strong.  In addition, the English rules were poor.  

I recently played Moderne Zeiten with three players and it was a much happier experience.  The lower player count certainly increases each player's influence over their destiny.  On this basis, I have raised my rating a couple of notches.  

I really like the art deco styling of Moderne Zeiten and its cute plastic airships.  Production quality is good.

4 plays. I like it, but am still forming my opinion. I think it has elements that are both excellent and awkward. But as it can last less than an hour, it's not a problem. We're going to try a house variant that doesn't have a sudden death ending, giving everyone an equal number of turns.

RATING: 8
A very pleasant surprise.

While the rules are quite straightforward, there is a lot more going on here when all the moving parts interact. It has a very Knizia-esque feel to it, in a good way.

First of all, the game plays pretty quickly and flows well. The theme even holds up decently.

One of the most interesting aspects of the game is managing your commodity of cards. You may be able to manipulate the stock market crash pretty cleverly, but it will likely cost you several cards. 

I'd like to pick up a copy of this in trade some time and would be willing to play any time.

RATING: 7.5
Finally got a chance to play this. It was a lot of fun. Its easy to teach and plays quickly. It didn't seem to have much depth and there is a fair bit of luck as well. I would still give it a 7.5. There is certainly a winning strategy but I'm not sure it can be executed without luck. There are also some good tactics but again they would lean towards what we call targets of opportunity more than clever play. However having said all that its still a game I'll enjoy playing and keep so considering I lean to the meatier games thats good praise for this game. Plus where else are you going to get a Zepplin as your game piece.

  Defines the problem with small card shuffling for me.  The deck of 'small' cards needs to be reshuffled a lot if the Jumbo rules are followed.  Using the 'Designers' revised rules the stock deck doesn't need to be reshuffled but then a host of other rule problems crop up (ie. with ending the game).   Hopefully sometime a clear and playtested rules sheet will be available.  A good game exists here somewhere.

One play, four players. I found this to be really neat and interesting but also a little maddening because it seemed incredibly tough to get anything done; I felt like if I didn't win the auction to go first, it was a crapshoot as to whether or not I'd be able to accomplish anything worthwhile on my turn. Nevertheless, I'd definitely try it again.

I like this game, which unfortunately is marred by an incomplete set of rules. Once you know how to play, the game is not bad with 4 or 5 players. However, it really doesn't work with two, and I cannot recommend the game for 3 players either. The new version (Batavia, Queen Games 2008) is basicly the same, but with improved rules and board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting 'racing' game where you don't want to go too fast because you need to capture as many technologies in as many cities as you can. My first playing was with a house rule that modified the die rolls (a roll of 1 offered 3 stocks and a roll of 6 offered 4 stocks, the rest are the same) that I think made control of shares tougher, added to that we had some low rolls. The wonkiest part of the game is the person who ends the race gets to place as many stock cards as he wishes to get bonuses in stock majorities without breaking the stock market's 25 shares in play maximum. This might not come into play too much but in the game I played I had a lot of stocks in my hand and was able to get majority in three technologies. Possibly introducing another house rule like the robber in Settlers would help keep someone from hoarding might help. Update: I read the more recent rules .pdf here on the geek and it looks as though the designers corrected the english translation or more likely revised the end game. This will probably fix the only real problem I had with this game.

I did not like the game.  It had really cool air balloons though.  I thought the reward for the cities was so different from crappy to nice that it made it impractical to try and plan for something. 

I did play with 5, and it felt chaotic and not fun.

RATING: 6.5
A good game, where the misunderstood rules work better than the published rules.  We always play that you can end the game if there are no more of whatever commodity type you choose to exercise the majority in -- the official rules are that there can't be any empty spaces between you and the last square.  This puts an uneven emphasis on planes, it seems.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game that is clearly overlooked in my game group. The confusion with rules probably didn't help but with the designers rules the game is very good and tense. Controlling stocks, deciding on your focus of a particular city or business, and how far you want to move along the game board provide interesting decisions on your turn. The game is usually very close. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
In the past I've played this a few times with 5 and found it fun, tense, and frustrating.  Frustrating because there were so many times when I could not secure a majority in any industry and became pinned down.  

With three, I found the opposite effect.  It became almost too easy to gain majorities, and so buying cards seemed to be secondary.  Many turns I could advance just on the strength of cards I had already placed.  My wealth of cards was exacerbated by the fact that we rolled LOTS of sixes, resulting in big auctions.

On the plus side, with card management becoming less important, the actual boardgame offered more control.  I found that I missed the tension of the greater competition in the cards nonetheless.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Love the Zeppelins, but hate the paper money.
This is not a financial game.  It's a game about gaining majorities and crashing the market at the right time. 
I'm going to call this one a cross between Acquire and Tokaido.  Yes, you heard me right.

I love the Alphonse Mucha-style game art.  I finally bought a copy of this in 2008, and have really enjoyed having it.  My good initial reaction to this game started at a '7' rating, and has now climbed into "Excellent" or '8' territory.

There is a lot going on in this game, yet the rules are simple and the play is brisk.  An excellent combination of speed and depth!

RATING: 6.5
This is one of these games that has got a retheme but I was eager to get the original with the zeppelins. The components are excellent. Nice to move the Zeppelin Markers. We had to score with an extra rule that whoever was closest to the Zeppelin track (read the spot next to it because of movement ) breaks the tie.
It was needed as our game was extremely close. 10-10-10-9. Karl won this one with the extra rule.
the stockmarket crash. remove the cards  highest in total when 25 cards are played in a 4 player game is a great mechanism. 
However it fellt a bit dated. That's why I can't give it a 7 right now.
I don't think it will work with two playersIn all I think it's a solid family game.

All these years I was waiting for the moment to try this and... it didn't impressed me. Scoring table is not balanced and that's not a good thing. Components are bad ones too (but hey, that's Jumbos' style). The game was a disappointment for me! Try Batavia instead, it's a little bit better.

Mixed thoughts on this one. Only 1 play, and I didn't get to grips with it until halfway through (wanting to keep the game moving to start with), so then found myself in an unenviable position. I like the crashes. I like the auctions. Seems like a few ways to progress - hoard for now or play for what you can win now. Essentially a rummy game with multiple ways to score for each person at different times. Which means you can always blame it on the cards not coming that you need!

The revised rules from MKW improves the play, especially with market crashed cards being discarded rather than reshuffled into the draw pile, preventing the problem of high probability of those cards being reintroduced into play. So now there is card counting and speculation. An interesting game of realising when or how to get ahead (and when or how to slow down yourself and others),but lacks any intrinsic humour. Other negative attitudes: Involves a little lookahead, causing some downtime, so best played with 3. The colour of the shares could have been brightly different to help the comparing attitude. The management of the white zeppelin is littly offputting. The central scoring table provides a spatial puzzle of evaluating rows and columns, and with the fluctuating score status, this maybe too fractured for a tired mind. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Several things going for this game - with a few issues.
The heart of the game looks to be the city scoring tiles getting majorities for the higher cities are vital. However the game play very much drives you into a tactical flair by trying to win majorities in industries, which can translate on the industry side of the scoring. 
The race mechanic along the city track is interesting As is the the zero sum auction for initial cards (industries) in the turn. 

Pity there is so much confusion on the end game conditions - think it is because of the difference between the city majority and the industry majority track. 
The designer's revisions (all spaces from your position to the end must be filled in before you can advance to the end) will benefit the person who holds back and tries to fill in the spaces while penalizing the one who is pushing to end the game. 
The original translation (if you don't have a majority in an open industry location between your position and the end point, you can advance to the end) leads to a quicker end game and more control to the one trying to end the game.
Personally I prefer the original translation.

My suspicion is 4 is the sweet spot. 5 is too crowded, 3 too open.

Finally I love the Art Deco art work and the use of zeppelins for the game pieces.

Moderne Zeiten has some great ideas for a game.  When you first get into it, you can see how it would be a fun, there is the zero sum auction that Traumfabrik later used, there the investment track that creates a neat race matched finely with the share chart and some nice hand management.  But after the first bust I realized that there was really no way to control the victory conditions.  There just isn't enough that you can do on your turn and if you are forced to pass due to a bad draw or from being outbid beyond your control, you will always be one chit behind on the chart. Even then the chart itself isn't an assured pay off and even if it is it doesn't pay off well enough to compensate for the absolutely random endgame scoring.

The real problem is that if you go out you get one point. If you have the most money you get points. If you end the game you then get to lay down your cards and those that come after you in turn order don't get to play, thereby allowing complete control over busting the market and getting majorities which are worth real points. These are the only way to assure points.  

So it seems the best play of the game is to forget trying to compete on the chart (which is the heart of the game) and just hold out on bids and not move until you have the most money and a bunch of cards, in which case you can just jump forward and end the game.  This goes against the spirit of the game.  

This game is all about controlling extreme chaos, and you may achieve this control but high chances are you are going to sit back and watch the game play itself.

Cool balloon bits, although the board is a bit on the drab side. I really like the auction style, deciding when to take control of an industry vs. protect against a crash, the area-majority (in cities and industries); it just plays pretty cleanly!

After playing it, I only later realized it's a lot like another game ... Batavia. But I liked this better than I remember liking Batavia! Going to have to play it, and/or Batavia, again!

--- Summary ---
The board shows a spiraling path of cities with one of 5 industry types pictured on each space. The center has a table of industries cross-referenced with cities. The game starts with players getting a hand of stock cards, and $15 (million) each.

Each round starts by rolling a d6 and revealing as many stocks. Then reveal as many cards, which are auctioned off as a lot. The auction is a closed style: pay other players $1 at a time, starting with player to left of winner, till all money is paid out. The winning bidder becomes Start Player. On your turn, may either draw 2 stocks, or play as many stocks as you want. If you play stocks and have a majority in any industries, advance your marker on the board to the next closest space of any of these industries; place a claim marker on that space, and a marker in the corresponding chart in the center of the board.

A track is used to keep a running record of the total number of stocks in play -- if it exceeds a number (varies with player number), the market crashes: whichever industries have the most total stocks in play crashes; those stocks are shuffled back into the deck.

After everyone has had a turn, begin a new round (repeat above). The game ends when someone advances to the end of the path. Score VP:
+3 for triggering the end of the game
+1 for most money
+3 for having most chits (on table in center) in each industry; ties --> all tied players get 1VP
+1 to +7 for having most chits (on table in center) in each city; ties --> all tied players get 1VP
Most VP wins!

It's a real shame that there's been so much confusion about the rules for this game, because it really is a very good game -- maybe three or four different games, since there are so many different ideas in circulation about which rules should be used.  Our group still prefers (and will continue to champion, since it now appears that no definitive rules will ever emerge) the rules we learned from the first available English translation, where a piece can be moved to the game-ending square (just as it can be moved to any other square) without all the intervening squares already being occupied.  In this form the game has a unique and wonderfully incisive quality and works well with every number from three to five.

End-game has always seemed a bit quirky to me, and something indefinable seems to me to be missing or just off-kilter.

Played with 4, using the designers' rules.  Nice game, attractively made.  I suspect the outcome is quite random, due to a lack of control over which city spaces can be taken leading to unintended ties for majority - or maybe, with more play, that's the subtlety of the game.

I adore the utterly closed system of the game.  No money in or out.  The ever-crashing stock market provides very interesting challenges.  I'm sure it helps that in my first game, I was 2 points ahead of all the other players, who were tied... until the money was counted up, and one player beat out another by one bill, taking first place by one point.  Nonetheless, Moderne Zeiten is fun every time I play it, and I keep wanting to play it yet again.  Brilliant fun!

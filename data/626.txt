Just the right scale for simulating Napoleonic warfare for my interest in the period.
BTW: The 'river of convenience' AH created towards the eastern edge and blasted by SPI for its stunning unreality almost kept me from getting this ~ but I've never played a scenario where I've gotten that far yet, and I imagine it was placed there for more 'meta-simulation' purposes, so this has not been an issue for me.

An odd, well done, blah looking little masterpiece. The system is nothing short of brilliant in the way it portrays the differences between the French and Allied armies, and the maneuver and concentration of operational warfare during the period. The campaign rules are flawed, but the Tete a Tete rules expansion in The General look to make it a really interesting game. But the scenarios are great for both two-player and solitaire. Another gem to be had for cheap.

This game won't work hardly at all for solo play. Thats my main beef with it. I also don't like the fact that its merely strength points instead of real units. Just a preference of mine. BUT, it you can get several friends and have the time, it can be a blast ! But again, if you play alot of solo, it wont work period. The designer put NO thought into the political system for solo play. I could write a book on the flaws in this area. Some of the scenarios work ok for solo play, like the Spanish campaign.

This is a very simple game that has been eclipsed by more complicated games and newer style games, but I played a lot of it in the 1980s and early 90s, but solo and play-by-mail (??), so it has a place in my heart.  I still have it and might use it to play with my son in a couple years.  The community updates to the rules and alternative maps and counters available for purchase (!) look quite tempting.

Going by the suggested ratings.  Tried the campaign game a couple times, never got into the feel of the era the way, say, World in Flames brought a WWII feeling to a complex, long game.  Just not worth the time invested. A good effort in it's day, and worth having for the student of the era, or of the history of gaming.

RATING: 10
Updated rating; comments are years old.

The graphics are dated, and even for the time they weren't top notch (the map could have used a baseline color of pale green, pale yellow, tan, whatever, instead of the glaring hi-gloss white), but this game was the first successful rendition of the full Nap wars from Spain to Russia.  I have not played the campaign game, but have played the scenarios a ton, and have enjoyed them a lot.  Some simple and brilliant differentiation between the armies regarding troop quality and leadership  satisfies historicity, and has rational victory conditions too.  (Too bad this was forgotten when they started on TNW). For 30 years, this was the only decently functioning, broad sweep Nap strat game out there.  An extra .5 kudo for that alone.

Strategic game of the the Napoleonic Wars.  Not a bad system, but it seems to get stale fairly quickly.  Have not played in a long time, but would try again with the right group.

RATING: 8
I might be speaking mostly from nostalgia, but I always thought this a user friendly Napoleonic grand scale war game. Map could be better looking, but works well. There are some excellent scenarios but this game is a two player (maybe 3 player) game and the grand campaign game has some issues. (I've never seen a campaign game last more than four years)  Still I had a lot of fun with this one.  Lots of variants in several issues of the General magazine might be worth trying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Another of the games from the 70s/80s that is almost irrelevant today. War & Peace is far too long, tedious, and fiddly to play today; the endless attrittion rolls and tedious managing of supply lines is just not interesting, entertaining, or particularly authentic. Empires in Arms is where it's at, or at leat, more so than War and Peace.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A noble enough effort for it's time.  Strategic Napoleonic games had to start somewhere.  I'll keep it as a rather unreliable reference.  This is really imho somewhere between strategic and operational level of detail.  Gave to Curtis.

RATING: 7
Neat strategic simulation of Napoleonic warfare, with fairly simple mechanics and a host of scenarios. Supply and the resulting attrition is key, as armies slowly die on the march, and grand offensives peter out in the Russian waste. A neat combat system gives the potential for truly massive battles through ongoing reinforcement from nearby columns. Achieves a lot with a minimal rules overhead. Elegant in operation, even if the graphics are bland - except of course that wonderful cover, thanks to the generosity of HRH
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great game of the Napoleonic Wars, including short and fairly simple two-player scenarios, all the way up to a five-player Grand Campaign game.  Tactical Matrix adds flavour to the outcome of field battles.  Map's geographical accuracy is somewhat suspect.

Have only played the Austerlitz scenario as The Little Corporal.  Beat the Austrian Army (and my own French Army) to a collective pulp in a field battle 3 hexes east of Ulm.  100,000 casualties.  You really need to compute the odds in every prospective battle like a poker hand.  In that regard, the game is good for getting across the concept of manouevering against lines of supply so as to force battle at odds and in place that suits you.  I need more play at it though, but right now it feels unusually hard to develop an edge against your opponents.  I am wondering if the system is missing something that conveys the essence of that French momentum in the Happy Years until 1808.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The campaign game does not work well with two players and I have heard bad things about the downtime in the campaign game with multiple players.

I can recommend the individual scenarios and the multiple hex battles work well.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

The scenarios covering the major campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars are excellent, but the campaign game falls flat because it's a two-player experience.  That might work for the latter era but is disappointing in the earlier years when there was so much friction between the states that opposed Napoleon.  A very ambitious effort that still retains some fans, but I'm not one of them save for some of the scenarios.

Interesting strategic napoleonic wargame but would have gotten a higher score if it not for the following:

1. Poorly written, at times confusing, convuluted and conflicting rules. Because of this, gamers waste a lot of time just playing the game.

2. The Campaign game breaks and gets confusing in the Spanish section but can be fixed by house rules.

3. For some weird reason, the Ottomans are not included in the game and they were a major country and a factor in the Napoleonic wars.

4. Huge number of errata needed to fix the rules.

Now with all this, this game would have rated lower than 5 but I think that most of the problems have been fixed by the errata(well most of them) and I think that with all the major problems solved, this game can be smoothly played and played rapidly though I think that beginners will probably be turned off by this game for the reasons above.

The game was ahead of its time in using tactics chits. Attrition is brutal, and forces you to use multiple corps as opposed to massive concentrated armies; that is very Napoleonic. The game is however colorless from the bland map and units, to the absence of even light chrome. Strange for such a big bold scope. I like the simple rules and multiple scenarios, yet the flavor of the times doesn't come through. The variants, while complicating things, add enough chrome and is what boosts this game from a 7 to an 8 in my eyes.

Sort of a Third Reich for the Napoleonic Wars.  Good combination of grand tactics and strategy, that still holds up 27 years later.  An excellent introduction to someone wishing to game the Napoleonic Period (and you can actually FINISH the campaign game here, as opposed to..well you know the game I mean).  Biggest issue is the depiction of major rivers on Map 4 (Russian Empire).   The designer took A LOT of flak over this; he tried to defend his decision both in the General and at a wargaming convention I attended.  He failed miserably.

Another great classic. You can fight every napoleonic campaigns from 1805 to 1815 and also a long campaign 1805-1815. Simple game system but very efficient.

Outstanding game mechanics on top of a flawed overall package.  The Unofficial 3rd Edition of the rules helps tremendously.  The new, 3rd Edition map really completes the package.  This game had enormous potential when it came out, that is being fulfilled now, and is great fun to play even as it was.  Thus the high rating.

This game has always a magic appeal to me. I have played Frederick the Great with similar scale and map. That is a very good game, more so than I expected. I wonder if War and Peace is the same. Also, the movie of the same name has grown on me. I have a friend who owns this but we never manage to play it. I really hope someday we'll do. The rules on diplomacy might have some problems for a 2 players game.

Whenever I try to play one of these hoary old AH wargames, I always end up feeling guilty. I would dearly love to somehow get myself into the mindset of an oldschool '70s gamer lovingly recreating history's greatest conflicts. But the towering, unstable stacks of cardboard chits drive me to distraction, and the rulebooks are always structureless, grimly meandering prose narratives that have to be double-checked every single turn! I tried the introductory scenario of this one, and managed to get Napoleon's ass hauled about halfway to Vienna before sanity demanded that I stuff it all back in the damn box, probably never to emerge again.

This is an old time hex and counter game that I played with a friend a number of times.  Quite good scenarios as I recall.  Not overly complex for an Avalon Hill wargame.  These days, I'd rather break out Age of Napoleon and play the whole campaign in a couple hours.

I think this game is the best strategic non-card driven Napoleonic game around.  The third edition rules have brought together all known erata and have cleared up some of the anomolies in the system.

The quality of the components is typical of Avalon Hill at the time.  The designers played with the geography of Europe in order to make everything "fit" however there are some anomolies that exist but these do not detract from the enjoyment of the game.

The game plays very well PBEM.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Ok, this is an old cardboard chit game that recreates Napoleon's campaign.  It has none of the cool slick graphics of Age of Napoleon, but it is a good game nevertheless.  One reason that I like it is that you are not confined to just the cards and can try a different approach - not that it changes the outcome much!

A grandiose game, but you need committed opponents willing to see the game through if playing the Grand Campaign.

War and Peace is a classic conflict game with all the well-known elements: leaders, infantry, cavalry, artillery, fleets, hexes, supply centers, supply lines and so on. Nevertheless, it's simple and lets the players focus on diplomacy, strategy and tactics instead of rules. War is merely the continuation of politics by other means as Clausewitz said...

I liked the innovative combat system. Attrition is better if you roll separately on each map board section, rather than one roll for the whole board. Silly tactics such as the French sailing to Plymouth and stealing the British transports, just because there's no garrison on the first turn (as recommended in an article in the General) are annoying.

*sigh* I really like this game. Have played it over many years, recently started playing a few of the scenarios again with one of my friends.

Provides some good, balanced scenarios - 1805 Austerlitz, 1812 Russia and the Spanish campaign spring to mind.

We played the Grand Campaign multiplayer several times. There are some grey areas in the rules but still a lot of fun with the right group.

Mark McLaughlin has developed 'the Napoleonic Wars' - effectivly a modernised War and Peace - worth a look if you get a chance.

Well designed and fun game covering the Napoleonic Wars. Not difficult to learn and set up, but you'll likely be playing a few weeks if you go for the grand campaign. Not many games have taken this approach (Hex and counter) to a strategic Napoleonic Wars game and this one I think does so successfully. Most play like Empire in Arms, this plays more like Third Reich. Still one of my favorites 25 years after I bought it.

Bought this game because it reminded me of SPI's 'Frederick the Great', in terms of mechanics. Larger scale game where stacks of strength points, representing your armies, are moved around by leader units. Battles are at a very abstract level. High level strategic/operational game of the whole of the Napoleonic Wars. Decent counters, nice mounted (in mine) map of Europe, stretching from Portugal to Moscow, albeit at fairly low detail. Game play was about as I imagined, and I had a good time with it. The map came in handy for some other home brew games.

This is my favorite overall Napoleonic war games - great coverage of both the whole war and individual campaigns. It came out of the box with many rules problems and confusions, but there have been plenty of fixes as well as additional rules for a piracy option for the French (!) and others. If you like the game enough to have the patience to collect all the downloads, it will be well worth it.

I've actually played games with Mark McLaughlin, a very pleasant fellow, at the CT Game Club in Middlefield, CT. His forte is big war games with miniatures, not mine.  I'm unlikely to ever play this game but am glad to have a copy in my collection of Avalon Hill games.

No es comparable al Empires in Arms, pero los escenarios están bastante bien y las batallas son bastante originales.Le tengo cariño a este juego.

Only played the first 3 scenarios but I liked the system and the scenarios were interesting and seemed kind of balanced. Though the first one seems pro French.

New games like Age of Napoleon/Napolionic Wars or old monster game Empires in Arms are much better.

The rules are a good combination of "straightforwardness" and "chrome". The French have built-in advantages of the "attrition", "forward marching," "morality," etc., which with my limited knowledge seems to make sense. A good & fun game!

Need to get a copy, the one I got via math trade is very poor condition, suitable only for some parts and even than not much even for that, certainly not the counters.  Individual who sent me the poor copy going to make good by sending me a copy of Iron and Oak so I am okay with that.  I have since got a second copy of War and Peace and all is well, picked up on Facebook,  the other copy is barely suitable for a parts copy I certainly would not want to play a game with it.

This is a good choice for a strategic Napoleonic Wars game if ANY of the following apply to you: (1) You only have two players. (2) You want to play solo. (3) You want an old-school hex-and-counter game. If you have four or five players and are willing to try a card-driven game, I'd suggest Napoleonic Wars.

Great simulation of the Napoleonic Wars, especially if using the optional rules. Campaign game is very good but lacks an incentive for the French to invade Spain (in fact, it's a pretty bad idea all round for them) which tends to skew any more 'historical' replay of the Wars.

Gets the job done I guess, but really lacking in period flavor, with all units just generic strength points with no real nationality differences. Smaller scenarios just don't capture any feeling. Could do worse though for a grand strat title.

My first proper game in 1980.  At the time it was all I ever wanted from a boardgame.  A real history lesson on Napoleon, his marshals and the alliances of the period.

Try as I might, I tried to like this game. I gave it my all. But in the end I have to count it a failure. It's just not "Napoleonic Warfare". The Order of Battle is too generic and the counters, in particular the leaders fails to inspire.

I know there have been some valiant efforts to revive this classic but what it really needs is an overall with new counters and where leadership will mean something. In the end, it might just be too ambitious a 
Reject to succeed.

In many ways this game is a lot like AH's 1776 game.
They both use generic counters. And the heart of both games is the tactical cards, which make the game interesting against an opponent, but almost unplayable solitare.
What really hurts this game is a map that just doesn't inspire me. And the counters don't use standard nato symbols. What is with these silhouettes? They make the counters look even more generic than they are.
Still, the game has leaders! And that is an improvement. And it is the only game I know of that tries to recreate Napoleons wars from start to finish. After he became emperer, that is.
It plays relatively fast once learned. The day I bought this I was with a friend who had never played a wargame before. I took it home and we learned it together and played an entire campaign game that same day in less than three or four hours.
If the map and the counters were better looking I would play this a lot more. But as it is, I haven't played it in years.

Our gaming group in Jr High and High School played the heck out of this game in the 70s...

Other games have far surpassed it since and I used the counters out of the game to make counters for personal wargame designs...

The CHEAPEST source of 1/2 inch counters for many years...

pure BLASPHEMY I know...

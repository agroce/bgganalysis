A great example of fair division principles used in game play. This is a fun, light filler that gets quite a bit of mileage out of the simple "I cut, you choose" method. And it plays really fast too. Recommended!

RATING: 6
Tasty components serve up a rich feast of fun. There's a bit of strategy too. It is mindless and fast - so just what I was looking for. It is a bit cut throat at times and a touch mathy. Not sure if it will last much longer in my collection. Just not a good place for it.

Seemed brilliant during explanation, and I really enjoyed the first play.  Kinda surprised by how much the shine had worn by the second, but I still think it's a very solid design.  Cut/choose mechanic, good box, good theme, fun decisions, etc.  I wish that eating instead of taking pieces wasn't so painful to the point of seeming bad.

High marks for the original concept and simple strategy.  The components are very well designed, and the game itself is surprisingly challenging.  I'm sure it would be even more thought-provoking with more than two players.

RATING: 8
I like the simplicity of this game, and the difficult decision of how to slice.  It's interesting that they're able to create some strategy in such a simple system.  Choosing which piece to take is often rudimentary, but knowing when to try holding onto a slice instead of eating it is a little more difficult.  After one game I thought the game was devoid of any strategy, but after another game or two I really started to see the strategy emerge.

The real meat of the game is in deciding how to slice.  Often there is one or two slices that you will want to have for yourself, but it can be quite difficult to figure out how to slice the pie so that you can get the pieces you want.  Are you willing to get stuck with only 1 piece if it will insure that you get a 10 point bonus?  That's the most intriguing aspect of this game.  Also of note is the very high production quality.  The slices are nice thick cardboard and the art is pretty appetizing.  The designer even had the foresight to make each pie out of 11 pieces.  This way, no matter how many people are playing, you can never divide it evenly.

(Note:  There is an interesting variant for the 3 and 4 player games posted by the designer here on BGG.  It really balances out the disadvantage players get from slicing the pie and getting stuck with the last piece 2 times in one game.)

If you play this game quickly, it's a good little filler.

Well, something must be right about a game that you play once the morning after you bought it, then play again 3 times that day. And in fact there is a lot right about this 20 minute filler. A small box, simple pieces (57 cardboard pie slices and nothing else), very simple rules and yet some very difficult decisions.

I know this one will be coming out again and again. One qualification is that I have only played this with 5 so far - we will have to see how it scales down to 3 or 4.

Update: Worked very nicely with 3. So much so we played it 3 times in a row. One thing I really, really like about this game is that you do not know who has won until you count the points at the end.

Update: Seems to work very well with 2 as well. Some excruciating decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A different type of filler game.  I imagine it would really be good with more than two and my rating could go up.

Considering how easy it is there are choices to be made.  How to cut the cake, do you go for the dollops or most of a type.  There is a little bit more than meets the eye with this one.  There comes a point where it's more beneficial for you to eat the pieces than to collect certain types. I like it and will definately bust out again.

Played with four.  The divying is much more difficult.  Good stuff.

This game reminds me of dividing the cards in the game San Marco.  It is fairly abstract, but it can be light if you don't over-analyze.  Card-counters and people with a good memory are more likely to win.  It's certainly playable with both children & adults.  Unfortunately, it's too much of a brain burner at the end because it's almost a perfect information game.

Couldn't really get into this one... I played this game by simply eating the cake every turn, and had every chance of actually winning the game, losing narrowly to someone who was playing strategically.   Not convinced that the design is all that sound.

Rating upped to a 7.  On second play, the game does seem to have good depth... there's a tradeoff between eating and scoring majorities that isn't so clearly obvious at the time.

This is a game where you can make your cake and eat it too.

A 3 feels a little harsh, but "probably wouldn't play again unless nothing else was on offer", which is about what I felt, seems like a 3. This is another one of these simple, light, brutally calculational games, which as a group feel very wrong to me. There just isn't a lot of nuance here; what you see is what you get, and what you see isn't a whole lot. Not terrible, but there is far better stuff available in this category.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very quick and stripped down "I split, you choose" game.  One player flips over 11 tiles to form a pie, and then divides the pie up into sections of slices.  Then, going around the table everyone picks the section they'd like.  

You can either keep slices face-up, in which case you're vying for the biggest set of that pie flavor, or you can "eat" the pie, in which case you lock in points equal to the dollops of whipped cream on the pie slice.  So, you either go for the big points for set collecting which others are competing with you for, or you can lock in fewer, but uncontested points.

As usual, the "I split. you choose" mechanism often makes for some tough choices for the splitter, and often tough choices for the chooser as well!  Pretty good for a quick 15 minute filler!

Initial rating a "7." What a clever little filler! I might even pick this up at some point, as it seems like it could play well with kids and adults alike. The "you split, I choose" mechanic is wonderfully simple and effective.

Cute game, with great components. Its got very straight-forward rules and plays in a short amount of time. A great little filler. 

Ever since San Marco, I've been interested in games with a good "I divide, you choose" mechanic.  Here we have the Coloretto-level implementation. Its not particularly filling (ironically as a filler) but this is a good little game to pull out occasionally. I'd love to see someone take this into a meatier game that works well.

I don't need to own a copy, but I'd be happy to play Piece o' Cake any time.

A lovely short game, perfect for any moment you need to pass a short time. It is a game based on the I divide-you choose mechanic, and features two separate scoring mechanisms to make the dividing and chosing a little trickier than you'd think at first. I do not yet know how the game works at high player numbers: I do know that the power of the dollops of cream goes down, and that of the majorities goes up as there are simply less pieces of pie per player available. But it's simple, doesn't take more than a few moments to explain, and looks gorgeous. Why aren't more games like this?

Components: Delicious-looking pie wedges. Sturdy tiles.

Experience: Fun set-collection game. Plays quickly and simply. Lots of math, to calculate profit margins on securing a type of pie vs. eating the dollops. It's fun to divide the pie, it's fun to select my wedge; it's fun to decide what to do with each slice.

Most people I've played with enjoy this game. Plays very quickly. Interesting.

Interesting take on the divide and offer mechanism.  Coloretto still does it better, but this one gives the option of cutting your losses on things you don't want, which helps people who are stuck with a lot of dregs, but also introduces a bit of risk management for players who are ahead in a category:  do you score your excess and risk being surpassed, or do you forego points to ensure you maintain your category leads?

Relatively painless 10-minute filler where pies are split into pieces.  You choose how to split the pies, and whether to keep your pieces for majority scoring, or eat them for whipped cream points.

First off, the English name of the game sucks.  These are more like pies than cakes.  The German name makes way more sense given point scheme: "...but please with Cream." This is one of the few games that features one of my favorite mechanisms: I split, you choose.  The game is extremely easy, you randomly make a pie of 11 pieces which will have different pies.  Each pie has a number.  This number tells both how many pieces of the pie are in the game and what having the majority of that pie type is worth in points at the end of the game (ties mean both players get the points).  Pies also have cream dollops.  The higher point pie types have more cream dollops than the lower point ones.  So, after the pie is split, the player left of the splitter and then clockwise will choose a portion of the pie.  They have two choices at this point: (1) Discard that point and eat all previously acquired pieces of pie of one type, or (2) Keep the portion of pie and deciding which pieces to acquire and which to eat.  Eating a piece gives you points equal to the cream dollops.  To win, people will usually have to do a mix of eating and acquiring for majorities.  As I previously said, I love the splitting mechanism.  There are a few oddities to this game for me however: (1) it seems very rare that you would choose to discard a portion in favor of eating/acquiring, (2) It almost feels as if 5 rounds isn't enough.  Maybe I would find 2 sets of 5 rounds better or maybe I just want this to have more substance than it actually has.  It's a decent filler but there are others that I prefer.

Game is OK, but I don't think I'll ever play again.  We have found other types of games to interest us and this isn't one of those.

This game is a great looking, fast playing I cut you choose style games. Although this genre may be problematic from a design standpoint, gameplay is fast enough for me to be forgiving.

I wish the design process would have made this game a little more random and a little less solved - this could have been done by making a second set of pie worth 3.

Excellent components, simple mechanics, game play is tense and fun. I've played with 4 and 5, works great with both those numbers. High "let's play again" value. Great as a filler and also as a light main event if scores are cumulative over multiple rounds.

RATING: 8
Interesting fun game.  I would rate it higher, except for heavy kingmaker effect (final player to go first). Also, there is too strong of a negative impact of being the first player.  Instead, suggest 6 rounds for 3 players (play with 48 slices, 8 per pie), and 4 rounds for 4 players (play with 52 slices, 13 per pie).

It's okay, but there's not a lot here. The designer has taken the mechanism of one person dividing the pie and the other choosing the slice, and applied the theme of ...er... dividing a pie. It's okay, very fast, it's okay, but well, not much else to say. The pies look really nice.

On Bruno Faidutti's Best Games List.  Visually attractive, sturdy comonents, small box, easy rules, fast play, some strategy.  Great family game.  Love it.

You can effectively win by just watching what your opponents collect, face up in front of them.  But the "Card" (tiles) counter does have an advantage.

Clever little filler. One player cuts the cake, everyone gets to choose one piece, and either eat it immediately for (few) points or keep it in the hopes of collecting majorities which score more.

Since the player who cut the cake goes last the main concern is cutting the cake in such a way that the other players don't get anything useful. Usually that means you won't get anything useful, either, but such is life. The game works pretty well but decisions in later rounds are obviously much more important than the early ones so it's not particularly balanced.

Backe, backe, Kuchen: Pro Spieler werden verdeckt komplette Kuchen vorbereitet, die zufällig aus verschiedenen Kuchenstücken von Erdbeerkuchen bis Sachertorte bestehen. Coppenrath & Wiese lässt grüßen! Der aktive Spieler teilt den Kuchen nach seinem Gusto in Teile nach Spieleranzahl. In Spielerreihenfolge nimmt sich nun jeder das Teil, das sein Herz begehrt. Dabei kann man die Kuchenstücke gleich verschlingen und erhält die Sahnetupfer auf dem Leckerbissen als Siegpunkte oder man legt Kuchenstücke beiseite und versucht die Mehrheit in dieser Kuchenart zu erlangen. Wer jemals bei seiner Großmama zu einer Tasse Kaffee Haag zwischen Bienenstich, Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte und einem Stückchen Linzer wählen konnte, während im Fernsehen Peter Alexander und Waltraut Haas im Weissen Rössl zueinander fanden, weiß wofür dass das hier ewig gut ist.

Fun light filler that illustrates Rawlsian "veil of ignorance" well (since the person who divides up the cake must go last, he would want to divide it up as equally as possible), but makes for a limited game with low replayability. Good for non-gamers maybe, as the cake pictures are nice.

So it turns out you can boil "I cut, you choose" all the way down and, just like a delicious fruit pie filling, that just makes it better.

Contains more depth than it first appears, but still just a light set collecting game. The game consists of randomly drawing pie pieces which are arranged in a circle. Then, the "serving" player divides the cake in as many pieces as they would like (up to the number of players). There can be some interesting decisions regarding how to divide the cake and when to eat vs. collect pieces.

Interesting game.  But, it can be frustrating when you build a split that will give a LOT of points to one person that that you have a better chance of getting what you want, but then they go for the much lower scoring set for them just to screw with you.  I game that should be based on logic, yet still has so many illogical moves.

That's a damn good game!

It plays fast, has interesting decisions, and is quite fun.

I don't think the strategy is too subtle, but it is cool.

It's actually a game of chicken.  You want to have just enough of each pie type to get the majority.  If you don't get the majority, you should have been eating the slices dammit!

The process of getting the slices is a lot of fun.  "I-Cut-You-Choose" is a seldom used but very fun mechanic.

I wish it were released over here in the states.  For now, it's worth the $20 to me, but that might not be the case for you.

This game was fine. It was very much a distilled 'I split you choose' and it did that pretty successfully. I'd say at the beginning you're mostly just playing by feel and then at some point it becomes the case that you can start calculating everything out, so I sort of wish there were some more interesting decisions. Also, there's a minor card counting aspect, it's not bad as far as those go, but I really hate that kind of thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
"I cut, you choose" as a multi-player game.  The pieces you choose can be used either for immediate scoring or for most-of-a-set scoring.  Collecting the sets generally pay out more, but if you're going for a set and you don't get the most, you score nothing.  It seems like so much of it's outside of your control that it's hardly worth the effort to figure out the optimal play.

takes one mechanic (one person divides the options, everyone else picks 1st, though in this case you are restricted in having to preserve the order of the offerings) from "San Marco" and makes a very nice filler out of it that takes only 20 minutes to play.

could see this also becoming a card game edition some day to make it even more mass market (Target or Walmart) like "Loco!" is to "Quandary"

To be honest I played the game a long time ago, in that year I didn't comment games I played so I don't remember much. 

I remember I thought the game was gorgeous but very thin on decisions.  It has some resemblance to Coloretto and Amy liked it a lot. The main mechanic is kind of interesting (you cut, I choose). And that's all I remember. 

The theme is unique bit not that interesting. 

If and when I play the game again I will recommentand re-rate.

The cake rule is the game. Piece o' Cake is so true to theme it could almost be called Ameritrash. Joking aside, this is a thematic little 20 minute filler game that only takes so long because the mechanism of splitting is an AP inducing element in any game that uses it. In the game, each player gets to take the split decision once or twice and has five actions to choose his part of the cake. This is channeled to a majority scoring at game end with players deciding  between safe lower immediate points or potentially more but uncertain points at game end they only receive if they have the majority of a type of cake. Good filler if there are no AP victims with a potential disadvantage for players splitting more often and especially splitting in the final round.

The idea here is that one player will split the board into pieces of cake but all other players will get first pick at which pieces to take.  Essentially it is a sort of set-collection where you're betting on whether or not you'll get majority in each type of cake.  Fun game and it seats 5!

It is a good example of how a designer creates a game which focuses on a few key decisions but through clever design and production deccreases the likelihood of analysis paralysis.

Very simple game in concept, the mechanic is literally "I cut, you choose". The addition of collecting slices or eating them adds an extra dimension to the game and I just found it light fun and surprisingly low in calories (especially that game where I hardly ate any slices). Two player it felt a little odd and I am sure it will even better with more players. But even with 2, I found myself thinking hard over whether to eat or keep each piece or how to cut the pie so I get what I want. So simple in presentation, it is a game with layers.  This is a highly requested game in our group whenever short and light is needed.

I got this primarily because I felt my daughter would enjoy it. She does, but so do adults.  Even non-gamers will try this out and like it!  Once you understand it, you think more carefully. Anytime I introduce this game, the newer players always want to run it back to have another go.

Added to my collection in January 2010. First played in February 2010.

A game that I purchased just because of the cool parts and the chance to play it with my daughter. We play a variation where we choose from the face down slices and are trying to make a cake with one of each slice in it. I enjoy the game with my daughter more than the game itself, but that justifies its place in my collection.

Initial rating a 6.

Delightful filler based on the concept of "you cut the cake, I'll choose the piece I want". In each of 5 rounds one player divides a pie into pieces for each player, which are then selected one by one. The aim is to collect the most slices in the most valuable types of pie, but also to collect cream dots. Very clever. 2-5p.

On further play: the skill level seems to deteriorate with the number of players.   This is a very tense game with two, and challenging with three.   4 players is too much, though.

The choices are difficult, and there is a push-your luck element as to how many slices of the cake to eat, and how many to hold to preserve the majority.  have played with 2 and 3 players; not sure how the game will change with 4 or 5, but I am sure it will be quite different - skipping a selection to eat some old pieces wasn't worthwhile in our games, but I can see it being important with more.

Piece o' Cake is one of those 'I divide and you decide' games where the players are trying to earn points for collecting the most pieces of various cake/pie pieces. Players can't afford to make divisions too generous to help the opposition or too poor unless they want to be left with the scraps.

It's very much like the central mechanic in San Marco...except here it is the entire game bar the scoring.

In this quick filler, the game pieces are made up of pieces of pie. Each pie slice has a number ranging from 3 to 11, with a number of cream puffs on it. The first player, without rearranging the order of the pies, must divide the slices into a number of pies, so that there are enough for each player. Then, in clockwise order, players choose a portion. After choosing, they must decide whether to eat the slices for VPs, counting the cream puffs, or keep them face up to score points for having the most. However, points are only awarded for those who have the most of a suit, including ties. 

It's an interesting game, and plays quickly. A little bit of luck, a little bit of majority control, and some decision on whether to consume right away. I have only played once with 5 players. so there may be more skill involved with less players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite a delicious little filler: You split - I choose. Two point-scoring avenues: Eating (safe) or keeping (risky). I like it insofar, not much variation though. Works quite well with the whole range (2-5) suggested number of players.

Wrings the bare minimum out of the "I divide, you choose" mechanism, but it's really enough to make for a solid filler. The scoring assumes others at the table will act sensibly, which won't always be the case. Strange that the graphics show pies instead of cakes, but that's really quibbling. Fun for what it is, not much more than it first appears.

RATING: 7.6
Arguably the best game I own for introducing non-gamers to gaming. Very, very simple rules, takes a minute to teach, often very short to finish, but forces players to make meaningful decisions, think about strategy, and base their decisions on what the other players are going for. Great introduction to the "eurogame" style of games, where the player interaction is indirect.

Gameplay-wise, not my favorite game in the world, but a great addition to my collection nontheless.

I'm really pleasantly surprised by this one.  There is a decent amount of strategy involved as you decide how to cut the cake to ensure you get the piece of cake that you want or prevent your opponents from getting the pieces that they want, especially if you know your opponents well.  For example, my daughter has a hard time saying "no" to strawberry when it is available.

RATING: 5
First impression (5 players): The game has a nice basic idea. You form a pie and you must divide pie and then everyone gets to pick a slice (with divider being last to pick). You can either eat pie pieces immediately or leave them wait for later to possibly gain more points. It's an okeyish filler but definitely shouldn't be played with 5 players. There you have too little room to maneuver with slicing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice little filler. Might be best with five, since otherwise the point difference between going for majorities and eating every slice is too small.

Agreeable mini-strategy loosely based along the lines of the mathematical theorem. A bit of a lottery with high player counts, at which point Coloretto appears a much better option.

The pie-cutting problem, reduced to its simplest elements and beautifully presented as pie wedges. [i]Piece of Cake[/i] is hardly the most complex game, but it requires some thought about probability and and the likely actions of other players.

Oh Yeah! This game rocks! The name is really bizarre but I like it (...With Whip Cream Please)! This game is all about pie...yes pie...and how to go about slicing that pie! You will lay out 11 pieces of pie into a round pie shape! You will then slice that pie in such a way as to give your opponents an "equal" share...I'm of course kidding, you don't really want them to have an equal share...do you? No you don't...because you will collect points on the kinds of pie slices you will collect...and you want those points! But, you might get hungry along the way and need to eat some slices...that's ok because the whip cream puffs will count as points in the end too! So do you collect the most points in pie slices or do you eat your pie and count your whip cream? That is the question! Bon appetite!

*每次輪到時可選擇
1.拿走一分派並選擇要吃掉那些或保留那些，吃掉的翻面，沒吃掉的正面疊起放面前
2.不拿派改將之前放面前的一種派全部翻面吃掉
*所有玩家行動後將剩下的派棄掉然後換起始重新一輪，擲到五輪結束
*所有翻面的派上面幾個奶油幾分，正面的派個數最多的拿上面分數(平手都拿)
*派的分數同時也是他的總張數

I believe the solomon's choice mechanic is the worst possible mechanic to be used in a game. It creates a bunch of downtime, and it's no fun watching someone go through all the contortions of creating the perfect choices. Mostly they give up to keep the game moving, approximate something, so you effectively get a random split anyway. So why bother. And this game takes the cake in this regard. The split decision is no fun, and the take decisions are pretty trivial once offered. Happy to leave this cake out in the rain.

What I liked:
- Very clever design. Simple but very difficult decisions

- Thematic confusion between cakes and pies

Based on one play: You create a pie with a pre-determined number of slices and then divide it into the number of pieces that there are players. The next player then chooses which slice he wants and it goes around till you get the leftover slice. Not much too it, light but some may over think it and make it longer then it should be.

The gameplay is nice. It's just so simple that it's great! One divides the cake and everybody chooses before that guy.
I don't like the scoring methods. They are simple but too weird for my taste. The good thing is that there is options (whether to eat now or save). Apparently both are needed.
Components fit into small space and look good on table. Of course they could have been smaller but this is ok too.

A good filler game for relatively large groups. I give this rating especially because of its fast gaming time. Provided that the one who divides the cake isn't prone to AP!

'Cake slicing' mechanism expanded to a quick light weight filler (1 player divides, then gets last choice). Theme and components mesh quite well.

RATING: 8
It was an inspired idea to take the "cut the cake" mechanic from San Marco and use it in a game about... cutting cake. I really like the see-saw balance in the two scoring methods. If everyone likes to fight over majorities, then just eating cake becomes preferable. But once everyone decides eating is the way to go, you can get some steals on the majorities. When cutting the cake, you want to set up your opponents to fight over majorities, in the process making them less valuable. It could easily be a card game, but having the cake slices really adds to the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game has a lot deeper strategy then its simple rules and concept would seem to imply. Cutting the cake can be tricky as you try and balance what you hope to be left with, and what you hope other players aren't able to get.It does have a little bit of "player to your right"  syndrom, but it is not to bad.  Overall the game is simple and fun, but still requires some thought, planning, and risk taking to do well in.

Good game that is based on the Canal Grande and San Marco mechanism where you have to make groups of pieces of cake that each player will have to choose. Of course the one making the groups is the last to choose. the rules are very simple, the game plays very fast and is a good starting game for our gaming night or a end of the night game.

Bon jeu basé sur la mécanique de Canal Grande et San Marco oèu vous avez des pièces de gâteau que vous devez regrouper de façon à ce que chaque joueur ait une part.

At your turn you may cut the cake in pieces, then all other players choose a piece and you are left with the last piece. When you obtain cake you have to decide to keep it or to eat it.

Played this at three. Very quick.

The mechanic of scoring a tile instead of saving it for area majority scoring at the end is clever ... it gives the last player drafting for tiles a decision, and gives purpose for useless tiles.

I could imagine this game drag for more players, though, because it's a drafting game.

To have your cake or to eat it, too?  You can try to dominate a flavor of cake to score more points than just eating it on the spot. But if you have to hold onto more pie than the printed reward, you are likely leaving points on the table you would have been better off eating on the spot.

I liked the game theoretic aspects of this game.  I liked the splitting mechanism, even though there weren't enough pieces or rounds to really lead to complex/creative splits.

This game has two things going for it: 1. It's quick. 2. It's easy to teach. I like divide and choose games, but this one has a little too much arithmetic and too little else.
Probably best suited for playing with kids maybe six years and above. Should be good for parents to play with their kids as a quick evening game.

Fast and easy to teach filler. Should be renamed "easy as pie" for the American edition, because these look like pies not cakes. There are several types of pie slices here. Each pie slice has a number on it. This indicates the number of slices of that type that are in the game at the start. It also tells you how many points that category of pie is worth. You can also tell the slices apart by the artwork. Each slice also has 1-3 dollops of whipped cream on it, which can also be worth points.

Shuffle up all the slices, remove a few from the game at random, and deal up a number of piles. Each player gets at least one turn forming a whole pie using the pie slices in a pile. Then they "slice" that pie, separating it into segments (so there's one segment per player, a segment being at least one pie slice and probably more). Each player (ending with the slicer) claims one segment.

When you claim a segment you decide what to do with each slice of pie in that segment. You can either turn it face down -- getting one point for each dollop of whipped cream -- or you can leave it face up. This decision can't be changed later. At the end of the game, for each type of pie, the player who has collected the most face up slices of that type collects the printed points for that category. For example, if you have two face-up cherry/5 slices and nobody else has that many, you get 5 points. Everybody else with face-up cherry/5 slices get nothing for those slices. As I recall, ties are friendly. Then you collect points from your face-down slices, one point per dollop of whipped cream.

That's it. It's very interesting to play the slicer, trying to figure out what people are going for and trying to make sure you get something useful since you get the final segment whatever it is. Because some pieces are secretly removed at game start, you can't always be sure if there is another boysenberry in the next pile, leading to some juicy risk/reward choices. This game has everything I like in a warm-up or filler game.

This game is so devilishly simple and clever that it makes you wonder why you didn't think of it first. It takes the pie rule, makes it multiplayer, and adds in the always interesting decision of deciding whether to accept a low riskless payoff (eat your slices), or to go for the high risky payoff (collect your slices). You want majorities, but you don't want to collect too much for it, because you'll probably have been better off eating all those slices instead.

Ties in majority are friendly in this game. That completely went contrary to my normal thinking and meant I didn't know how to cut my pie. Eager to play again just so I can cut a pie well this time.

The pie rule was a new concept for me, and this game proves that you can form a good filler from a simple rule. It's  played under 15 mins, yet there is a decent amount of tactics involved not only in dividing the cake, but choosing which pieces to keep and which pieces to eat. You probably don't want to overthink on this one though as part of its charm comes from how quickly it plays.

The one downside is that this game is pretty pricey for the amount of game time you get out of it. The golden brown crust on the back of the tiles looks real delicious though...

Very easy to learn set collection game. After a couple of 2 player games, seems like a strategy of getting early majorities in higher value slices, then eating any further slices that come your way for cream bonuses has worked for me so far... 

Wondering if games with more players will work the same as will only have 1 slice per round to choose...

A cool, and more importantly for me, quick game to play.

Ok drafting game where others are making the sets for you.  I'm not big on drafting.  It seems like this is the kind of game where you just take what your best option is rather than a choice of best options.  There are occasional exceptions, but in most cases this wasn't the result.  

The decision to be made are less what to take for yourself and mostly how to slice the pie to prevent others from getting something good and what not to leave others down the line. You only slice the pie once in a five player game and the decision making process in the beginning of the game is far less interesting or relevant as the mid to late game.  Because of that the game tends to slow down as you near the end because of how calculable everything is.  

Taking slices to prevent others from winning them is rarely a good idea unless it will net you something.  Usually this will be something of a tiebreaker result if you may actually have a worthwhile decision to make in what you take.

It was too quick to be offensive, but I really wish I felt I had more to do with my own success or failure.

I LOOOVE the concept of "I cut, you choose!"  Very clever.  I love trying to come up with the most diabolical ways to cut the cake (SIDENOTE: these are clearly pies, not cakes. wut?). Not the most complex game ever made but FUN and the pieces make it super charming.  There are decisions to be made about eating or collecting PIE (not cake) and you may want to shift gears once you discern what your opponents are up to.  Sneaky.

Fun, very different game.  The mechanisms aren't novel, but it feels different than anything else we play.  It's short, although people can take awhile deciding how to split the cake.  Hasn't felt like AP/downtime yet, because you see what decisions they are faced with and try to figure out what you'd do.  So it's kind of an engaging puzzle even when it's not your turn.

Amazon.de has it at a reasonable price to the US if you have enough other items to justify the 14 euro flat shipping.

Neat little game that reminds me of Coloretto. Loses a point because while optimal play is difficult, it's roughly calculable; it just requires a lot of thought, so much that turns take a bit too long, which makes for less fun than quick suboptimal play. That's an uneasy tradeoff.

It is a nice pie splitting game -- I split, you choose. Each round (5 total) a player makes a pie with 11 random slices. THere are 11 types of slice. Each slice has 1-3 whip cream dollops. The start player splits the pie as they see fit (but no more groups than the player number?). Then, in turn order, player. choose a group. For each slice the decide to save for the end, where th player(s) with the most of each type score VP equal to the number of slices of that type in the game, or eats it now, flipping it face down and s oring 1 VP per dollop of cream. At end, any face up pies where you don't have majority are worthless. Most VP wins.

The game plays quickly but the splitting and choosing actions are still pretty thought provoking. I like it!

-----
From designer Jeffrey Allers:
unofficial variant I came up with for the 4-player game is to award the player who is the first server with one of the "extra" two slices in the game.

For example, at the end of the first round (after everyone has chosen their slices and eaten or collected them), the starting player looks secretly at the two extra slices put aside at the beginning of the game, chooses one, and puts the other back face-down, so that the other players do not see what it is.
As usual, she/he must decide to collect this slice or eat it immediately. Then the next player begins the second round, forming the second pie, etc.

In the 3-player game, the second divider receives the remaining slice after the second round is completed, and must immediately decide to eat or collect it.

One of my very favorite games is San Marco.  I love the I-cut-you-choose mechanic.  Sadly I know of only three games using it (San Marco, Canal Grande and this).  Happily the mechanic is stripped down and implemented brilliantly in Piece O' Cake.  I really don't need another game with I-cut-you-choose.  San Marco when I want a heavier version and Piece O' Cake for the lighter filler.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4


Overall - 3.5

This game is actually a great little filler, visually appealing, nicely produced and some interesting decisions with nicely quick gameplay and easy to explain scoring.

The game is based around simple set collection of several different sized sets of different pie slices by a divide and choose-last pie cutting mechanism. Players are also forced to choose between risking everything to collect a set or eating cake slices right away for a smaller number of points.

DIY. This reminds me of Mammut in that you have a pile of things and the players need to figure out how to split the pile fairly. Mammut splits up the math homework among all the players and also uses interesting Ra-like scoring. In Piece O' Cake, one single player is making X number of piles, and his incentive to make it fair is that he gets last choice. The scoring is also based purely on trying to get majorities/pluralities in each type of slice, with a secondary way of scoring by essentially junking gains that aren't going to get you anything otherwise.

The first player (the splitter with last pick) really seems to get screwed. I don't think he has interesting choices to make, either. Don't make a pile that somebody else will benefit greatly from. Aside from that it's hard to do a relatively bad or skillful job.

I suggest using Piece O' Cake's rules with some Ra tiles. The dilemmas that arise would be a lot more interesting I think.

...Actually, what I think is good is using Piece O' Cake's components with 7 Wonders' drafting (or a card market, or a time track). It removes the AP hell, and the fact that all the scoring is based on majorities is in fact not dull, as I had been thinking. I find it very enjoyable to play this way.

I am pretty convinced there is no up-side to the "I split, everyone else chooses" mechanic. It's painful, unbalanced, and downtimey.

I also think it's better to not be able to eat your pieces for points. I think it muddies the scoring and reduces tension.

I cut, you choose...the game! But this is much deeper than it first appears. Do I eat these pieces now and get the sure-fire points or risk going for the majority of this type and getting more points (or 0) at the end of the game? Don't ask me, I'm not very good at it, but it's a lot of fun!

An "I-divide-you-choose" mechanism reminiscent of San Marco and Oasis. This simple game strips away the complexity of the other games and boils it down to the core mechanism of dividing and choosing. The server cuts the cake and the players choose which section of the pie to take. Points can be obtained either via immediate scoring(slices are eaten)or long term set collection where the majority scores points. The rules are as simple as that. While the game is straightforward, there remain many design uncertainties. For one, it is unclear why players would choose to divide the cake any less than the number of players. I yet to see an advantage for doing so. Even when the server opts to eat the slices retained earlier, it is best to just discard the slices rather than giving it to the opponents. Another aspect that is troubling is that a total of 5 cakes are divided. With five players, each player gets to serve once. Perfect! With any less than five, some players will have to serve more than once, a distinct (at least up to this point) disadvantage since the server gets to choose last. Too many questions remain for this game to be a standout.

Rarely has a game made me stare into the souls of my opponents as much as Piece o' Cake has. This game is an intense psychological exercise in deception and trickery. Put on your best poker face while your enemy searches your psyche, a finger on each slice of strawberry cake, threatening to split it into two pieces, or combine it into a single deadly temptation...

Alas, I have to ding some points off of my score because some of the pieces are *obviously* pies. Who has ever heard of a pecan cake?! I kid, I kid. Piece o' Cake is great fun, plays fast and is awesome filler.

Interesting mechanism where the active player splits the cake into enough section for everyone playing but will get last choice. Worth trying.

First plays were a lot of fun. Seems like a great little game. My wife really liked it. Let's see if it has staying power.

Takes the classic "One divides, the other picks" and creates a fun game that looks fantastic.

Played the game with two people.  It's not really a two player game, but I can certainly see the potential with more folks at the table.  Rating could easily go up or down depending on how it plays with more than two.

Update:  Played with three players now.  MUCH better.  It's harder to keep track of who is taking what.  I assume it would be even better with more.

Dion introduced this game to Jerry, Ruoyi, hubby and myself. It's a neat simple game! Fun! Will consider letting go for the right offer as hubby is not too keen because of the splitting of the cake AP.

Got old after a few plays.  Still a good, quick filler game that would be good for kids.  Oh, multiple misprints on the cards, with only a 2 pieces of information per card, is lol-worthy.

...aber bitte mit Sahne is a great filler, or even a real main course for a few quick plays in a row. The game appeals to just about everyone I played it with because it looks good, and is extremely easy to understand. Everyone loves to hate the "I split, you choose" mechanism.

The best part is that this game has some oomph! There's a depth in ...aber bitte mit Sahne that you might miss at first glance. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cute, and fun filler. In fact, it works great as  dessert after a long night of gaming.  ;)

I also feel like I must point out that the official 2-player variant in the published rules is very good. It is a much better 2-player game than I would have imagined.

What a great filler.  Set out a pie, divide it up and let your opponents select their pieces with you getting the leftovers.  Dividing the cake is interesting... deciding what to take ranges from automatic to agonizing... and deciding whether to eat for immediate points or save cake hoping for the end game bonus provides a nice bit of press your luckish strategy to this nice filler.  Fast, colorful and fun.  One of my favorites!

The only tension from the game comes from guessing what others might choose.  However, this becomes clear towards the end when it is obvious who will be getting what majority, thus you can literally count how many points each section is worth to you.  There is also a problem with the "eating the cake" option, it is basically a last ditch effort and seems to have no use at all before then.  Good game, but not as deep as most of the comments are claiming to be.

Fun and quick. At times the choice of how to split the pie is really frustrating in a good way.

This would be considered a filler because it plays in a few minutes, but the thought process behind playing the game well can be quite intense. That puts it, I think, in the "gamer's filler" category, whatever that might be.

The components are okay and the theme is nice, but that cake just wasn't my taste. Sold on ebay.

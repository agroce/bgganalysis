I love boggle.  It's just as fun as Scrabble - but each round only takes a few minutes to play.  My kind of game.

I'm slightly embarrassed to have this rated as a "8".  But then again, I play it all the time and never get sick of it (weird, since I don't even own it.  I mean come on, it's what, like $10 or $15 at the store!? Pathetic).

After some time you learn the game and everyone is seeking for the same words. Tedious and leaves little room for creativity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I am crazy good at this game, because it isn't so much about finding words as it is about recombining words into anagrams.  Because once you find a word, there is a good chance that all the connected letters can be rearranged into at least four other words.  I beat my sister and her friends so often that I stopped playing with them because it felt unfair.  Finally I took to playing it alone as a computer game, since then I could see what words I missed and improve my score, without having sad little eyes stare at my winning word list.

Guess I'll rate this since I've played it during my board game tenure.  It's Boggle, a word game.  Something of a brain-burner.  Those with Scrabble experience, and particularly those familiar with the annoying Scrabble-allowed words, will have a huge advantage.  I like word games, but this one is not for me.

Probably my favorite game of all time. I love words and word games, and Boggle is one which anyone can play and which anyone can get good at. The time limited round format gets your adrenaline pumping, and there's equal opportunities for feeling clever and brilliant for finding long words noone else could as well as feeling like an idiot for missing those same great words. Always fun, playable with family and friends, and a good workout for you mind, too!

Maggie *always* crushes me in this fast-paced, real-time word game. She has really helped herself by memorizing three-letter word lists. The object of the game is to find as many words as possible in a grid of letters that changes every round.

A good lunch time selection.

Recommended with 2-8 players (best 3-4). 10 mins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best word game, with absolutely zero dead time. Get a vintage edition for a more challenging letter distribution - the ones from the 90's onwards are so full of CAR/CAT/RAT/TAR/ATE three letter words that it's mostly an exercise in how quickly you can write.

[i]Posted: 6/1/05, Rated: 6[/i]

[i]Boggle[/i] isn't for everybody.  The largest hurdle to overcome is that you should have an extensive vocabulary.  This requirement automatically excludes younger players from being competitive with older ones.

There are sixteen cubes, each of which has different letters on its sides.  These cubes are shaken, and then fall into place on a 4-by-4 grid.  Every player now has three minutes to write down as many words -- of three letters in length or longer -- that she can form by following an unbroken path through the cubes.

Therefore, the second attribute that is necessary is pattern recognition.  Most people do well at following straight lines, or making right-hand turns.  However, following diagonals, or being able to see a word whose path crosses over itself requires the development of a new skill.

The learning curve to satisfy these two requirements is steep enough to dissuade most new players from continued playing.  With the right crowd, [i]Boggle[/i] can be a blast.  With the wrong crowd, it can turn people off to word games altogether.

I enjoy Boggle for its fast pace and common pool of letters, but really prefer the game with some extra rules: (i) four letter word minimum; (ii) no plurals; (iii) no guessing (e.g., ''camt' sounds like it might be a word...'). Big Boggle takes care of the first point [i]and[/i] adds potential for longer words, so I would never pick Boggle over Big Boggle. However, I could be convinced to play the regular game (with or without my house rules) on occasion. (2011-02)

I'm an English major, so I have to like Boggle.  Gets a little lame after a while, though, because the repetition of similar letter patterns means you end up writing the same words over and over.

I think Set is a superior incarnation of the "search for stuff on the board" theme.  It plays faster, is more exciting to watch, lets people jump in without ruining the game (if you've ever had someone kibitz on a game of Boggle, you know what I'm talking about), has more tension, and doesn't make you feel like you're finding the same dang thing every single time.

Removing three-letter words from the game does improve it a little, but common word repetition still really kills it for me.

I can't help but love Boggle.  I played this as a means for creativity when I was actively writing for a few years.  When I needed a break, I played boggled online.  Not only was it a good break, it drastically improved my typing skills.

RATING: 8
fun, fast to play, great with the kids. I enjoy the stimulation of word games! My wife and I play with Cameron where we have a handicap of -7 when we play 1 on 1 against him, and -4 when we play at 3. It works well.

RATING: 2
Not a big fan of this one. I like the 5 x 5 boggle quite a bit but the normal size one just seems like child's play to me. Can't find any big words on the smaller board and just doing 3-5 letter words all the time is boring of you ask me.

I can't get enough of this game, and rarely find takers. My father and I played this when I was younger and my sole goal in life was to beat him. Now it's a rare round when he outscores me, and my fifteen year old son has the itch (the itch to beat dad).

RATING: 6.5
A number of years ago my wife and I played this obsessively.  But then we got tired of writing the same short words again and again.  As soon as my daughter becomes a decent reader, though, I am sure we will trot it out again...

UPDATE:  We now play this as a family in the form of Scramble on the iPhone.  It's a great implementation.  I can't see us going back to the physical version.  Even my daughter (now age 7) loves it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Gets a lot of hate from the community, but Boggle is probably my favorite word game - unlike Scrabble it is over quickly so you can play out a few rounds and not just get hopelessly behind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

If my choice is this or Spill and Spell, I'll take the other.  Not a bad game, just not quite as fun or as much time pressure as the other makes you feel.

RATING: 7.5
Classic word game.

Pros: 
Quick and Simple
Easy to teach
Travel version is compact enough to bring "everywhere"
A classic game that survives through the years

Cons: 
Old game that doesn't appeal to everyone
People with more vocabulary  might be better
Not a game for game[r] nights.

Note: A game I used to play with my family, even learned words playing this, so I really enjoy it.

Another word game that I am probably better at than other word games.  Overall, not a bad game, and a good, challenging one at that.

Caution - this game does not play well with more than 3 people.  The law of diminishing returns can get very frustrating with a lot of players, because it is so much easier to have your best words go for naught when someone else also gets your best word.  Stick with 2 or 3 players.

I wish I could convince others to play by different scoring rules, such as each word scores whether it is unique or not (who gets the unique words seems to have a large random element), and scor ethem by length (e.g. number of letters minus two), and have an equal but opposite penalty for words attemped but not in the dictionary. I don't like debating whether a word should be included, not do I like the allowance for people to add anything that might be a word, nor do I like "only add words you're pretty sure really are words". I'm a gamer, I like rules systems that make sense.

Although I own this game, I don't play it much.  Most people I know don't really enjoy word games.  However, IIRC, when I was a kid, I had a solitaire version of this game.  The letters and timer were both sealed in an acrylic cube.  You just flipped the cube over to start a new round.  I loved that game!  It was my favorite activity when I was home sick from school.
Not a bad game.  Had to be given away due to a lack of space and an unexpected move.

Yay, reclaimed from a friend.  My wife doesn't care for it because it's too noisy when you shake the dice, but too bad!

I played this addictively in grade school and it has been a favourite ever since.  For now I'm a bit bored of it, but it will always serve as a useful filler on a game night with casual gamer types.

My partner learned it recently and she really likes it, so Boggle might be seeing some more frequent plays again.

I suck at this.  
 
Even as crossword fan I get crushed by people who know how to work the variations. This is the sort of skill some people learn that I have a hard time calling a game. To most folks a game involves strategic decisions, this is a brainstorming and visualization exercise.

I first played this game during the summer of 1983. I was hooked from my first play, and introduced it to my family immediately so I'd have someone to play with. As my kids came along they started playing as soon as they could read. I don't play it every week, or even every month, but this game has a permanent place in my game collection and my heart.

I guess I just love the challenge of finding words in the random letters, and of challenging my vocabulary against that of other players.

I played a lot when I was a kid growing up. I enjoyed the game as a kid, but I won't be playing again as an adult unless to spend time with niece's and nephew's etc. Or possibly some non-gamers. If so, they should have a copy of the game in question. I don't have my own copy since I switch from American board games to euro board games.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

One of the best word games ever.  However, I have found that people are either very good or very bad at it.  There definitely seems to be some kind of congnitive spatial ability that goes beyond spelling and vocabulary that is required to play this game well.  Those who don't have it, are often in for a frustrating experience.

I'm dropping my rating on this from an 8 to a 7 because I've NEVER lost.  Now, any game that I can play against divers groups of intelligent people and still never even get close to losing, has to be broken.  And I think it's because my trick is to write down a BILLION 3 letter words.  Why waste time on some fancy 5 letter word that everyone else is going to spot as well?  Go for short and go for quantity over quality for an easy win.

I like word searches, and crosswords so find Boggle to be a very entertaining brain teasing game that allows the players to create the time alloted to finishing a session.  Depending on the roll of the dice the games challenge changes frequently, yet even when a nice combination comes around the challenge stays as this word game quickly becomes an abstract race.

We got the game recently and it was a pleasant diversion.  When playing with kids we discovered working in teams is best.  This game was a recommendation from our non game playing son, so we just HAD to get it.  First night of it went really well.  The play was challenging, however the scoring and duplicate elimination seems to take overlong like all timed find-a-word games (Picture Picture, and Scattergories.)
We will certainly play it often (like Apples to Apples) if it brings everyone to the table.

I like word games. This one has simple rules, but infinite combinations.
Interesting variations can be added in my opinion, such as

varying the scoring system (even more points for longer words);

multiplying the score based on the player's age (x3 for 6 and 7 years old, x2 for 8 to 10 years old, x1.5 for 11 to 14 years old).

adding bonuses for finding a certain class of words (animals, things in the room, things with gears, thins with wings, motors, professions, etc.)

Grouping players into (balanced) teams

A interesting game unless you play with a word whiz. My wife beats me every time. While I am getting words like "dog" or "cat" or sometimes a big word like "boats" she is getting words like "extra-curricular activity." (not really but you get the point)

I have NO chance!

In my Scrabble days I looked on this as an inferior game. I can't remember why. It's an awesome filler (a round takes about 8 minutes including scoring) that supports any number of players and generally leaves me wanting to play more.

Boggle is a great game for just about any number of players.  It's fast and intellectually stimulating.  The main drawback to the game is that you have to constantly look up words in the dictionary to prove that the word you found is a real word.  Get a laptop with wireless internet access to dictionary.com and it's way more fun.  :)

Timed game. Word game. Noisy game. But really not bad other than that. It can be fun to come up with a word that no one else saw. The more people that play though, the worse this game gets. More than four and most everything you found will be canceled out. But I like that a novice can still do okay as the experienced players cancel the good words from each other.

Boggle is great! I can play Boggle several times a day. I often play it by myself, but the more people that play Boggle the better. I don't mind watching other people play Boggle either.

I've always regarded word games as fairly dry, even though I'm reasonably good at them. This adds time pressure and a positional element to the usual word making mix. I'm less fond of this than I am of Scrabble or Dicewords, associating it with children doesn't encourage me to take it seriously.

Unlike most people, I actually didn't grow up with Boggle and I've only played it a couple of times. I'm surprisingly bad at it; I guess it's a little difficult to read in several different directions at once and that is, after all, the basis of the game.  I like the brilliantly simple scoring system that rewards unusual words and, you know, word games are always fun. (2 plays)

--------------------------------

[i]Boggle[/i] is one of the best word games out there, above [i]Scrabble[/i], not because of any mechanisms that [i]Boggle[/i] has, or any gameplay issues present, but because of the fun that you can have playing it. While [i]Scrabble[/i] is a highly competitive game, [i]Boggle[/i] caters to a friendlier and more casual audience, and the game can be as ruthless or as gentle as you like. [i]Boggle[/i] supports any number of players from 2 upwards, though, like all games, it gets impractical to manage large groups of people. The game can also be played by a younger age group, and may be helpful in expanding the vocabulary of children, if it is used in the right way.

The only things you need to play [i]Boggle[/i] are the letter dice and grid container that come with the box. The aim of the game is to try and accumulate the most points by finding words in a randomised grid of numbers, which is determined by a player shaking the container and rolling the dice into the grid. At the end of three minutes, the players announce all the words they have found in the grid, above three letters. The players then receive points for each word they find that is unique to them. The values given in the rulebook as rewards for finding words can be changed any way the players to desire, and for games with varying skill/age levels, experienced players can be given simple handicaps, such as only being allowed to find words of five letters or greater. This method is particularly useful for family games, where adults are playing with children.

[i]Boggle[/i] is a game that I enjoy a lot when it is played in the right environment, and is particularly enjoyable with a family; the game allows plenty of scope between rounds for conversation and jocularity. It loses much of its appeal when played in a serious context, however, and I find that if I am looking for a serious word game, I would choose [i]Scrabble[/i]. [i]Boggle[/i] fills that widening niche for games with the family, which includes the majority of my gaming.

[b]Pros[/b]
- Easy rules, easy to teach
- Good, friendly atmosphere
- Can be used as a learning aid in the right situation
- Easy to modify for different experience levels
- Easy to modify playing time
- Sufficiently challenging for almost anyone

[b]Cons[/b]
- Does not scratch that strategy itch
- Not suited to serious play

Some of the improvements here a great if in contradiction.  The 'soft' cover for the dice tray does quieten the noise to some extent, and the electonic timer is great for those who get caught up in the game and forget to watch a sand timer.  But the electronic timer is loud and noisy.  Guess you can't have it both ways!  (I bought a sand timer from my local game's store for late night play)

Woordspelletje uit de oude doos, van oma en opa. Een doosje met 4x4 letterdobbelstenen wordt geschud, waarna de spelers tijdens een zandloperronde zoveel mogelijk woorden moeten proberen vormen met aaneensluitende letters (horizontaal, verticaal, diagonaal). Daarna worden de resultaten overlopen, en worden de woorden geschrapt die door meerdere spelers gevonden waren. Van de overblijvende woorden telt elke letter voor een punt. 
Noor (10) vindt dit een leuk spel, en ook Pepijn (8) deed in de marge goed mee.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2010)

I kind of like this game, I’m better at it in English that in my natal language (Spanish). The game can be played for a short or for a long time, it can be boring if the skill difference of the players is big, but if all the players have more or less the same skills the game is a blast. 

Nowadays I don’t feel the urge to play this as I feel it is a mainstream game and one I have played before realizing there were soooo many good games out there, so if I can choose I almost always will chose to play something else.

5 - Average game, slightly boring, take it or leave it ('Geek Definition). Not bad truely...the timer makes it much tougher. You need a vocabulary to play it well.

This game would get a higher rating if only the friends that we consistently play against weren&#039;t always kicking my ass.

If you are good at anagrams, you'll be great at this game.  The object is to find long words that your opponents haven't found within a 3 minute time limit.  I usually don't care for games with timers... too much pressure... but for this game it works fine.

Classic game still in my collection, but likely won't get played again. We played this until the sound of shaking the dice had boggled our brains. We put a dryer sheet (light foam) in the top of the lid to reduce the noise so we could play while my father slept.

This is a simple, but fun game of finding words on the randomly distributed grid of cubes with letters. I had one of the newer designs where you would rotate half the device and mix the letters. The kids played with it and it stopped rotating. I may get another copy.

I enjoy word games, and I like this one because there's less work to do.  The large amount of freedom given to rearrange letters in a game like BuyWord can be daunting, but just trying to find the letters among the dice is a nice, quick (I love the time pressure) diversion.  It's also really funny playing with people who tend to make up their own words.  :)

I despise word games. This is one of the worst offenders. Boggle is, "how many 3 and 4 letter words can you find?" and whoever has the largest 'small word' vocab will just spam their list with these words.

What gets even worse are the people that think they can turn the gameboard during the round because they just can't see any more 3 letter words... I hate this game.

I always have people ask about this game.  A friend of mine was teaching English in Japan and wanted to use it to help his students learn.  I gave him a copy that I had thrifted.  Now I have the older edition which I hear is preferred for the more difficult letter cubes.  I haven't actually played in years, but there it is on the shelf just in case we run across some boggle nuts.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The purest word game there is, in my eyes. I'm told that once you get too good at this, it becomes an exercise in writing down more 3-letter words than anyone else in the allotted time. Thankfully, I haven't reached that stage!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Mining a seam of similar words can get a little boring, but the lack of luck can make it a lot more satisfying than Scrabble. Doesn't even need the dice - I play it as an emergency standby game by just picking an arbitrary sentence and writing the first 8 letters checkerboard-style across a 4x4 grid, and the second 8 letters in the gaps.

I'm a sucker for word games.  When I have energy, I'm very good at creating a word blitz, but it's often more effective to find just a few long words.  I think I prefer Boggle Deluxe, though it probably weakens my style of play.  I enjoy the Yahoo! Games variant, Word Racer, as well.

Recently, I've been a lot less interested in playing Boggle competitively.  There really isn't much interaction or tactical brilliance.  You just keep skimming over the letters.

Classic word finding game. This is a great game for people who like words and patterns. It works best in groups of 3-4 -- too few people and it's too easy for one person to dominate.

Because the board changes with every play, there's always a challenge, even for experienced players.

I love word games in general, but what I like about Boggle in particular is the way it makes you go backwards, forwards, and all around to find words -- it's a different approach than any other word game I've played.

I also dig how tense it is, and the way it rewards you for finding longer words. Factor in its short play time, and Boggle hits a lot of high notes for me.

Oddly, it seems clumsy after playing it in app form (and Ruzzle, a more interesting clone). The letters don't all face you, you have to write every word and get many fewer, and it's harder to see connections while also reorienting letters. It's less fun than it used to be.

This is my home and travel edition.  I like this game... the only downside is when you roll the cube and come up with not enough vowels.  Try making words with just two 'i's.

RATING: 8
I have been playing this with my Aunt Sue since I was very young. It is a very good little "how many words can you find" game. Because the letters are on dice, and some letters appear more frequently than others, a letter may share a die with another single letter, eliminating a lot of words, for example, the only "F" is on the same die as the only "K", this is obviously done so you can't spell "FORK". It is hard to come up with long word (no I don't care how good your vocabulary is, that isn't going to make it easier to make 8 letter words out of the jumble letters on the board.

Bought for 75p, this is such a nice, simple word game which can be explained in 30 seconds. At just 3 minutes a round, it's short, too, which means it's easy to get in multiple games. 

My only quibble is that I'm not really a fan of against-the-clock games. Despite this, I enjoy Boggle, its main failing being largely personal preference...

... That and the fact that I can't get anywhere against my wife.

I generally enjoy vocabulary games when I play them, but they aren't a favorite genre and I rarely suggest them(or hear them suggested).  That said, I prefer this to Scrabble.

Some of my earliest memories of family gatherings involve sitting around the Boggle cube.  My rating may therefore need adjusting to account for the nostalgia factor.  Those with the broadest vocabulary of course have a distinct advantage and would probably also influence your experience of the game. Still one of my favourites because you can play as long as the group wants to, then count up the scores and determine the winner.

It's not so much the game mechanics itself that I don't like.  It's the eternity it takes during scoring for my wife to verify every permutation of letters she could conceive regardless of their relevance to the English language.

When I actually find people to play, I'm usually hooked for a solid hour.  While most of the game is silent writing, you are in direct competition with other people and can reduce their score by being awesome, which is probably why I don't have a lot of people want to play with me.

I used to play this a lot in the Facebook incarnation, Prolific. Given that I hate Scrabble because of the number of games where people just stare at the board and their hand and moan about how they can't make anything decent, this is perfect: 3 minutes of frenzied activity and that's it. And the computer version takes care of the counting and verification of words!!! -- Still, I don't really like word games all that much when the actual meaning of the word is irrelevant and to get good at it you need to memorize wordlists. Something like Codenames where you care about semantics is much more interesting.

A game I play quite a bit with the wife, but if there's a gulf between skill levels, then it's not much more than an independent skill test for both parties for their own satisfaction. Periods of quiet intensity, followed by a tick-off scoring. I like it, but it's only for wordsmiths.

This game is great fun when you're looking for a simple word game.  I really enjoyed word finds as a kid, and this game provides that kind of enjoyment plus an added geometric element of being able to bounce around the board.  The ban on 2-letter words prevents the pseudo-word silliness that Scrabble suffers from, though many of the three-letter words are almost as bad.

Very nice word game. Those who like Scrabble will definitely like it. Electronic edition with build in timer is great as you don't have to measure time yourself and the locked inside dices will never fall out and can't get lost.

A light game that is a lot more entertaining than you expect but you have to like word games and I do not.

Pros:
* Plays incredibly fast.

Cons:
* Playing with someone with a large vocabulary or who studies the dictionary will not be much fun.
* This game desperately needs an electronic timer so you know exactly when the game ends.

The best word game I've played.  Quick to set up, quick to explain, quick to play.  Not very dependant on vocabulary, which makes it an excellent game to give decent competition between adults and children.

A game we played frequently when I was a kid, both at home and at my paternal grandparents' house. My plays of this game tend to be nostalgia-driven and they come in waves. 

At the moment, shaking the letters is too loud for a nightcap game (lest we wake the children we so lovingly helped drift off to sleep) and so it sits waiting for some other opportunity to present itself.

RATING: 8
One of the better word games.This is fun for people with good vocabularies and who spot words fast. For all others it will soon get dull. This is a common flaw with skill games. The player with the skill will win almost all the time. Boggle is at its best in a group with the same skill level. Boggle is a game in serious need of an official handicapping system to even out things and make the game more challenging for the stronger player. Another plus for boggle is that it will often interest people who are not regular gamers allowing a gamer to play something with those people.

Not too terrible... more enjoyable than Scrabble with most groups. On the downside, the shaker is loud after a few red wines, and the dice often have trouble settling into the grid properly. Maybe a Boggle dice tower is in order?

Apart from being an enjoyable word game, it has an egg timer and you get to rattle a box full of letter dice then shake them into the grid.

A classic. The first positional anagramming game, and still a lot of fun if you like word games. Which I do. If you play this game like my sister and I do, there is a bluffing element as you each try to pass off some made up words on each other. Heehee. C'mon, it's all in good fun! A game only takes about 4-5 minutes (half of that playing, the other half word checking), so it's not uncommon to play a dozen games in a single session. Again, if you're not into word games, don't bother with the game. It's clearly just for word freaks, and at that is a fun piece of filler if you don't overdo it.

I like Boggle a lot.  Hardly a Gamers game, but probably my favourite word game.  Takes about 30 sec to explain the rules.  Each game takes about 3 min to run.  Play for as long as you like with whatever crowd you like.

RATING: 5
I only played this once in my younger years and I didn't do very good at it.  Still, I wouldn't mind giving it a go these days, perhaps with the kids as they begin to develop more of a vocabulary.  As I've mentioned elsewhere, I have a really odd relationship with word games, generally because of the degenerate play often found in Scrabble.  I would hope this one might be able to make it onto the like list if I ever got to really try it again.  [08/14/2007]

Arrrggghhhh ! Boggle brings pain !! 
I have very bad memories about this game. I had a girlfriend who wiped the floor ( and just about every other household surface ) with me in this game. The humilation was too much. I mean - she was some kind of &quot;Boggle&quot; demon ! I&#039;d have, like, 2 points at the end of the round and she&#039;d have fifty three. I got burned too often on that game, and if I ever play it again, it&#039;ll be several lifetimes too soon.

In my view a slight improvement over [GAMEID=320] since the action is parallel and you do not wait. Also not a game where you would talk too much during the play.

This is definately a game you are good at OR not!!! I am reasonably good at it so I enjoy it. One thing it does have going for it is practice makes perfect. I would recommend playing it solitaire if you find your skills aren't up to par for the opponents you play against.
It really is a matter of training your brain!

[400+ plays] My younger sister, my Grandma, and I used to play this for hours. Word games are great fun when played with others that love them.

Most recent play Christmas 2003 with Barb, Mom, Andy, and I.

RATING: 6
Simplistic word game. Some people do well because they can 'see' the words. Other people twist and crane their heads right and left to no avail. Took part in a tourney once and got thumped good. I was 7. I suspect that this is a knock off of another 70s word game I saw in a thrift store but can't remember.

RATING: 6
With an unknown opponent, I'd rather play Scrabble. Scrabble introduces enough luck to level the playing field a bit. The problem with Boggle is that if one player trounces the other in the erudition and pattern recognition departments, the game is very lopsided (i.e. NOT fun!). With two well matched opponents, Boggle just shines. There's no downtime. Games are quick (there's an hourglass timer, after all), but you can always play many rounds. And it's fun to see the different words that you and your opponent can find. I'm always impressed by the amazing words my wife can find in this game.

It is simple and requires a knowledge of english and a quick mind for spotting words.
The best thing about this game is you can play a few rounds when you have a spare 5 minutes and leave it at that.
I orginally bought it for my nephew who was having trouble at school. Games trick kids or encourage them to learn in a fun way. Boggle is an excellent learning tool and a fun game for anyone.

Had trouble rating this one.  I don't think it's a bad game, I just hate it.  Jill is great at this game, while I am average.  My test of a good game is whether or not I mind losing a bunch of times until I crack the learning curve.  I have no such interest in getting better at remembering to write down all the possible plurals and past tenses of the same word, etc. Pan Pane Panes Pant Pants...bleh.

A good filler.  Simple mechanics and works very well.  It's the sort of game you either like or don't.  It is the only game my partner will play with me, and consequently it is the most played game in my collection.  It comes out about 4 or 5 times a week after dinner with chocolate.

Despite liking word searches, I don't really care for Boggle.  Huh.  Maybe it's that word searches sometimes have a bit of a theme to them, and I'm looking for specific words rather than any ol' word.

I'm good at Boggle, just don't really like it.

RATING: 7
My favorite word game of all time.  I'll play this over Scrabble any day.  I grew up playing this with my mother and grandmother all the time and learned a lot of basic tricks (spelling 3-letter words backwards often gives you another word, double up on words by adding -s, -ly, -ed, etc. to the end).

It also helps that I'm really good at it, probably because I've played so much.  I've never gotten tired of this game and have been playing for at least 20 years.  Writing these comments reminds me that I should get a new copy, the one I have is the same one I got 20 years ago and is getting kind of raggedy.  I'm thinking about moving on to Big Boggle now that I'm all grown up.

The ability to directly challenge the vocabulary and the pattern recognition skills of others made this game a favorite of my (very competitive) family's while I was growing up. It was probably my favorite game until I was introduced to the modern eurogame scene. The 3-minute game durations and the virtually unlimited number of players make this a great couples / family / party game. The ability to expand one's vocabulary through playing is an added bonus. I consider this game a classic and certainly more fun than most of the Parker Brothers types.

My wife enjoys this game, but I continue to feel like it's a poorly designed education tool for children. I have a degree in English and enjoy writing, yet I find word search or scrabble type games terribly boring. I do enjoy crosswords but Boggle doesn't even offer that much of a third demension. Nothing but flat word search with a timer here.

My wife and I are word game fans and have a ball with this one...although we usually can't get people to play with us since other people almost always score "0" each round as my wife and I end up with tons of words and our struggle is to find the small handful of words that the other person missed.
Good times. :)

So many games have been born from the original idea of Boggle that it's impossible not to love it. If you are a word fiend, then this is where the fun started. I often play solo, because not everyone loves the game, but it works just as well (at least people can't steal my words!).

Big Boggle is the one true Boggle. 4x4 Boggle's only appeal in comparison is that it comes in a cute little keychain version. Sadly, at this tiny scale, the embossed word "Boggle" on the attached plastic top obscures the letters more than it should.

'Boggle es un juego de palabras tiempo en el que los jugadores tienen 3 minutos para encontrar tantas palabras como sea posible conectados desde la cara hasta las letras que descansan en una cuadrícula de 16 cubo. Cuando se acabe el tiempo, los jugadores comparan sus listas de palabras y eliminar cualquier palabra que se encuentran por varios jugadores. Puntos se otorgan por palabras restantes, dependiendo de cuántas cartas están en la palabra. (En el Boggle original, todas las palabras deben contener 3 o más letras para ganar puntos.)

Un ejemplo rejilla dada en las normas canadienses franceses (de Deluxe Boggle) tiene un sorprendente 459 palabras!

Un número de variantes se han producido por Parker Brothers lo largo del tiempo, como el Big Boggle (que utiliza una cuadrícula de 5 × 5 de letras y obliga a los jugadores a buscar las palabras más largas).

Boggle is another classic word game that i like to play but will rarely ask for it. I enjoy the game but it gets old too quickly. I usually enjoy the first 3-4 rounds but then after that, the game loses its replayability....until the next time it gets pulled out. Luckily, the duration is short and the game is over before you even get tired of it. I like word games in general and I am decent at it. But, the problem is that my group sometimes have people at different skill levels and it is hard to integrate folks into the game if English is not their first language. Overall though, this game is still a classic and will always enjoy playing...bring out the game...but what are we playing next?

Boggle is a fast and fun game.  Few games allow for an infite number of players!  However, I don't like three things about this game: writing all those words can be exhausting (hand cramps!), scoring takes longer than playing and certain players (like my wife) absolutely dominate.  For the first, I have a house rule where the minimum word length is four.  For the second, nothing can be done (although the house rule helps here too)!  In regards to the third, if someone's brain is hard-wired for seeing the words (notably by playing countless times as a child) then nobody else can compete.  I'm happy to see my wife win but the fun rarely lasts when the same player always finishes first.

Playing online Boggle at weboggle.shackworks.com while bored at work ruined it for me for a while until I forgot all of the hundreds of random 3 letter words and the people that know them. I still kick the asses of casual Bogglists. All in all, it's pretty ok.

Pros: moderate replayability with variable set-up, quick playtime with no downtime, no luck

Cons: the best wordsmith wins majority of the time, not a strategy game

Still one of the most challenging word games I've encountered, and one you can generally always improve upon if you work at it. However, unless you have a particular talent for finding words, it can be mentally tiring.

Have an old 4 x 4 copy, we play with a 4 letter minimum. A good word game that I occasionally don't feel like playing. Paperback may have replaced this for smaller groups but this is still one of the better filler games out there and I think underrated due to its age and ubiquity.

This is one of those games that I really enjoy playing but have a hard time finding another person to play with. I've always liked word games and am pretty good at this, which might be why nobody wants to play with me!  LOL!  I found a handheld electronic version I could play by myself a few years ago.  I wonder if there is an iPhone app available now?

Excellent game for the brain. 
I find the modern version of Boggle a fair bit easier then one my father has from the 80's - more vowels.
When I play we house rule - no 3 letter or less words - they clog up your page and people scramble to write those instead of finding a few good words. And we don't count our scores unless you find at least 1 five letter word.

I'm really not a fan of most word games, and this one is no exception.  It gets a little bit like [gameid=320] as you look for obscure words.  It doesn't expand beyond five players very well, and it requires a whole group of word-oriented people to play well.

Being a Scrabble nut I'm always willing to try a word game. Sometimes the downtime on them is so long and painful that it just isn't worth it. Thanks to the 3-minute timer Boggle isn't one of those. It's great practice for finding all those 3-letter words that I've been studying on my Scrabble study guide. Of course finding the 7 and 8 letter words is the way to score the big points. I played 2 game with some word-novices so I stayed away from using words like ECU, CRU and AIT. It moved quickly and it was interesting to see what words they found that I had missed.

Interesting game.  Randomness of the cube throw is offset by everyone using the same values, and knowledge of 3-6 letter words dominates (in a few dozen or so rounds, don't think I've ever seen a 7-letter word come up).  Makes an interesting alternative to 'Scrabble' for wordsmithing, but...I think I prefer 'Scrabble' at the moment.  May just be familiarity.

Any number of players. A word game that comes with 16 unique dice that have different letters on each side and are shaken up and placed into the grid base of 4x4. Players then have a decided amount of time to simultaneously find as many words as they can using dice adjacent to one another.

I got this game at a garage sale when I got into the board gaming hobby. Enjoy this lighter game, but need to make room for others.

Used, and in good condition. No box though (although it's not necessary since the 4x4 grid base has a lid).

The three minute word game.  A buddy and I used to play this in high school german class.  At that time, we allowed english and german words as valid.  Good speed word game.

Really fun word game that plays extremely fast. It's my favorite word game I've played.

A simultaneous seek-as-many-words-as-possible game. No downtime makes this word game more interesting than most other word games. 

Replayability is not high, as the same words tends to come up often, and it is essentially a multi-player solitaire type of game. The time constraints does make it intriguing though.

An OK filler game, good for a few rounds.

One of my favorite word games of All Time. I literally played this hundreds of times growing up. I haven't gotten to play nearly as often since college, as my knack and experience keep folks from wanting to play. It's a fun game, but can be tense since it's timed, and some folks don't like the added pressure -- but in my mind, it keeps things brisk and challenging, as opposed to the overly long pauses in something like Scrabble.

Good game. It makes people very quiet - my father loves when we are playing it, lol. But it becomes a bit boring after a while.

An enjoyable word game my wife and I bring out once in a while when we need a break from cards but don't have time for Scrabble.  She regularly beats me as she has a quicker eye for patterns (including words), but I always have a good time all the same.

This is one of my wife's favourites too.

I was thinking about this game the other day and how many hours I spent with my family playing it when I was younger.  That alone gives it a decent rating, plus the fact that it's fun for people who like a decent word game.

This is the only word game that I consistently beat my wife at.  Usually I'm at her mercy in that genre.

For some reason, I had this rated at a [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5.6 [/bgcolor][/b], but when I more recently played 8 times in a row, it was a good time.  Since that time, I continue to enjoy it.

Quick, challenging and as short or as long as you want it to be, Boggle is one of my favorite word games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I love this game due to some good experiences I had with helping kids at an after school program through use of Boggle.  In general, they went from barely grasping the concept to holding their own.  I was absolutely thrilled the day one of them got a five point word!

I used to thrash my wife, but of late, she has been holding her own.

The purest make-a-word game I know of.  It's great fun as long as at least two opponents are fairly evenly matched.

I'm a big fan of anagrams and word games in general, so this game is right up my alley.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After 5+ Plays: Fun, for a while, but you end up writing the same three letter words over and over every time you play.

After playing Big Boggle, which is on a larger grid and requires 4 letter words, I don't see myself ever going back to this version.

The best word-building game around. Knocks the socks off Scrabble, as all players are involved all the time. More interesting when only building longer words.

My ears can't stand anymore hearing these dice shaking in the plastic cover... awful! And don't be surpised if you can't find a single word during these long 3 minutes... sometimes it seems like there's no voyel, except for that damned "Y" (not really useful in french!)

RATING: 5
A tense game that I'm not that good at. It kind of bogs (har har) down when you have to read aloud your words. Also it makes a holy ruckus every time the word cubes get shaken.

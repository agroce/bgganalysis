This was my first programming game I have played. It took along time tell I got it on the table but the wait was worth it. The whole time I was playing it I was smiling and happy. The game also has a nother mechanism that I liked a lot, the scoring. A three part elimination scoring system. Will play any time someone asks to play.

Another good game... easy to learn hard to master... the scoring is a bit cruel but interesting ... i do modificated scoring rule by reveal first assessment in round 4, then second and third assessments in next round or round 8, so the game can be played more unpredictible and more competitive

Having not played the original, I still liked the idea of doing "trade" in the game rather than "draft and fight" better. The end-game scoring ruins this game for me. Some people might get to win just by "dumb luck" in the end.

You play a member of the nobility of the land of Xidit, which is the same land as the game "Seasons" takes place in. So if this mythology is something you are in to than there is added value there. For me it is about as useful as the "key land" keythedral is in. Players program their turns simultaneously in similar fashion to robo rally with the goal of moving from city to city throughout the land and either recruiting specific combinations of units or using said collections of units to conquer monsters spawning throughout the land. Timing is key. The game is a reimplementation of an older game called, "Himalaya", probably because lords of xidit sounds more interesting to gamers than Sherpas of the Himalayas. Fun game, perhaps limited in replay ability. Though so far the multiple tiered scoring system has kept me interested. The fact that you have to master three areas of influence in the right order to over come your fellow lords of xidit in the end game is really interesting and cool to me.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Lords of Xidit is one of the most stunning looking games I've seen so far. The board, the pieces... everything is just so beautiful! I sat down and I though: "Wow! I hope this is fun, because I would like to own a game like this". I played it and I was kinda disappointed, although the game is by no means bad. Just ultimately forgettable.

I enjoyed the programming and the pick-up and deliver mechanisms. I didn't particularly care for the scoring system, but I didn't dislike it either... it's for sure unique but nothing really exciting at the end. Instead I dislike how easy it is for other people to mess up your plans... I know it will probably get better after multiple plays, but it's still something that really annoyed me so far. Worse than that is: I never got a sense of achievement in the game. From the first to the last round I felt like I was doing the same thing over and over again... and I never felt that I had some big decision to make.

Maybe it's because I went into Lords of Xidit looking for a strategy game and I was disappointed to see a light family game instead... but I think it's just a very average game. The components are absolutely amazing, maybe to the point of being unnecessarily so, but the game-play is too light and shallow for me. Such a pity!

Great game. The system of programming your actions at once is so clever and frustrating sometimes, but everything works well here. The art are gorgeous and the components are great.

The final scoring is weird in the first play, but after the first time everything make sense and in future game sessions the strategy are clear.

A great aquisition in my collection!

1st play: Lighter than I expected, the art is a highlight of the game, and the programmable actions is implemented in an interesting way.  I have to play it again to figure out what kind of depth the game has.

We never played this a second time, so hard to judge, and I don't really remember it so it must not have been that good.

Played with 3 players and used a Dummy player. Not a good Idea. A lot going on to worry about scoring for the Dummy player.
 
4 player Minimum 5 good also? Will need to play again. With more player. I felt like something was missing during action Phase. 

Scoring is cool. Need to do everything when scoring cant not ignore any of the scoring options.

Components are top notch.  

Rating may change with further play.

Once set up actually easy to Play (Mechanically)

I really like it as an updated version of Himalaya. The biggest thing for me that improves upon the old game's formula is that three end game scoring conditions are randomized to determine in what order players are compared to one another for elimination. Nice. I like that.

The biggest mark against this version is the graphic design on the board. It's so messy it's kind of crazy distracting on the eyes when trying to see what's going on. Ugh. But on the other hand, this version adds plastic miniature units to replace all the cubes from Himalaya. Instead of cube pushing we're pushing miniatures around to defeat wacky monsters. I think it's a fun theme. 

The only sad part is that this version doesn't have any plastic yaks. Shed a tear for the lost yaks.

:'(

Both Xidit and Himalaya suffer from being a bit too drawn out (long) for their weight level. The worst part is if you get stuck in a rut and have to wait a long time to watch yourself get eliminated in the first round of scoring (sorry!). But I think repeated experience with Xidit and Himalaya mitigate these problems somewhat. The games reward experience. But just try not to play with especially slow players. Things won't go well.

Although the components are amazing - especially the little miniatures – the game left me feeling quite flat. I actually liked the scoring mechanic which I’ve heard a lot of grumblings about, but I didn’t like the fiddly way recruitment/fight counters are replaced and I never felt like I had interesting options. Once you’ve figured out how the mechanics work it’s basically about choosing the optimum move as you predict where fellow players will go. I’d play it again; I didn’t hate it – but if there were other options I’d probably try and steer the group towards them.

Mix of the following:

Programming - Space Alert/Robo Rally
Pick up And Deliver - Any PIck up and Deliver Game
Uses resources to attack monsters - Lords of Waterdeep (the colors even match fairly closely)

Love the elegance of the recruitment and monster cards playing off of each other.

Victory condition with Olympic style elimination with different criteria is excellent and adds a twist to every game.  

Downsides - If you happen to run into 1-2 series of events where the person gets there JUST before you or you get the wrong recruit, it can be very damaging and make for some bad gameplay.

Beautiful looking game with a lot of colorful components in the box, the designer has re-skinned and re-themed an older design, now set in the Seasons universe. A game in which you program moves to travel around a board, score influence and towers, recruit different adventurers and take on monsters. Might seem a little weird at first, but the gameplay is smooth and simplistic, and the scoring is quite interesting, you don't necessarily want to win in each phase, but you want to hang in there. Great!

Easy to learn, and the rounds go fairly quickly. The game seems to be mostly about timing, and understanding what the other players are going to do the next couple of turns/rounds.

Just one play in, but it was a great experience. The game rules are trivially easy, yet the game itself presents all kind of interesting decisions, while keeping the amount of options you have to choose from low, decreasing the dreaded AP problem of most games of this weight.

I need to play it again, but it does fit my sweet spot in terms of weight (a nice medium weight game with streamlined rules). The score might even rise with further plays.

A HUGE, sprawling, colorful game that is based on successfully guessing what everyone else will do, and the order in which they will do it. Not as complex as it initially presents, it is very unforgiving if you make a mistake or guess incorrectly.

[i]Jugado en BoardGameArena[/i]

De los juegos de Pick-and-deliver, pero no es tan malo realmente. El sistema de juego es peculiar y uno debe estar muy al pendiente de todas las "puntuaciones" para no perder pisada en la carrera hacia la primera posición. Se precisa muchísima "astucia" a la hora de predecir los movimientos de tus oponentes, creeme que predecirlos te dará tanta ventaja a la hora de reclutar como batallar.

Es divertido, sobretodo cuando se juega con 4 o 5 jugadores, en la versión de 3 puede llegar a ser algo simplón aun con el "jugador dummy", pero es recomendable.

Good game for sure. Perhaps lacks some of the bang from other games in my collection, but I believe that is due to the game being very fiddly. With more play time, the fiddly aspects will be more intuitive and I think it will result in an overall greater experience. I think my rating has more of a chance of going up then going down as I play a few more times.

2014, 3-5p, 90 min.  simult axn, programmed mvmt, pick-up-deliver, area control, likely AP prone (due to planning your 6 choices/actions per round), it's mostly tactics, chaos and take that... along with some bluffing regarding the pawns behind your screen.

Compared to Himalaya: still chaotic, still very tactical, and still has brutal scoring where you don't have to be the best in the 3 categories, you just have to be better than 1-2 opponents in the category (i.e., you don't have to run faster than the lion, just faster than your buddy).  The issue here is that you can just get hung out to dry with little chance of catching up in 1 of 3 categories (and the worst part is that you'll likely see it coming and have to sit through a good chunk of the game knowing you're out of the running)... on the positive side, supposedly the luck of where things will appear (previously 1d20) has been fixed and you'll know exactly where things will appear (however, I'm guessing it's still random and imbalanced like Himalaya based on Vroenis' comment below).

BGG user SeerMagic says the main flaws/issues are:  (1) mistakes cost deeply, (2) once behind, it's hard to catch back up, and (3) the bidding phases is a strange catch up mechanic that doesn't really work.

BGG user Vroenis sums it up as "...overly tactical with random opportunities...", which sounds like Himalaya all over again to me.

Fairly simple movement programming in a fantasy theme setting in the Xidit world. It's all about guessing what your opponents are going for to get the most efficiency out of all your movement steps. It's a solid design and the game looks great with the cartoony fantasy outlook. But the fun/challenging balance isn't such that I feel the need to play this more. It's an okay game.

I enjoyed the programming mechanic that made you plan carefully - yet best laid plans can go awry occasionally if you don't properly anticipate your opponents' moves. We especially got nailed in being too careless about players going before us in turn order, and winding up chasing them for an entire turn and coming up empty. Need to pay attention to other players' positions at the beginning of the turn, so that you don't waste a turn running behind them while they mop up what you were wanting! Well balanced, with a simple rule set. Great medium weight game with an interesting 3-tier final scoring that can knock you out on one assessment, even if you scored first on the other two.

I love, love this game.  I love the little figures, I love the opportunity it gives me to create this epic adventure story in my mind --saving towns by defeating monsters and having the bards sing my praises, gathering townsfolk from across the lands-- while at the same time still having some strategy to play and having to try to figure out what my opponents will do, and I love that things can look bleak for the win but you are still never out of the game entirely and because of the unique scoring method may still come out on top in the end by just not scoring the lowest in a couple of categories.  There's risk, there's gambling, there's getting into the minds of others, there's bluffing, there's set collection, there's planning, there's storytelling and battles... there's enough frustration to cause a few people to rage quit on occasion, heh... what's not to love about this game?

A great pick-up and deliver game with simultaneous pre-programmed movement.

This game definitely improves on it's predecessor, Himalaya, by allowing for much more forward planning.  Himalaya could be a bit of a crap shoot where the supplies and demands showed up, but Xidit allows you to see where they'll be popping up in advance, which is a big improvement.

Player interaction is very good, as you're always trying to predict what the other players will do in order to plan accordingly.

[I]Seasons promo card included in the Seasons base game.[/I]

I had been keeping an eye on Himalaya for quite a while, but then gave up once it was out of print and increasingly hard to find. And then I heard about the reprint...

After one play, I'm impressed. I really enjoy the combination of programmed movement and pickup/deliver. The game runs very smooth and feels like a very polished design. Plus, the unique scoring situation really adds to in-game decision making as you work to have "just enough" in the first two scoring categories.

Component-wise, the game is impressive. The dials work fantastic, the figurines are very well done... the only knock is a slightly undersized cardboard fortress that is placed in the middle. That's an incredible nitpick though.

This is a very approachable game, not quite a gateway, but one that should work with fans of midweight games.

Update: I ultimately traded this away. I like it, but it fell flat with everyone else in my gaming group. If I'm honest, there are some similar games I'd rather play like Edo and Maharaja... somewhat similar programming route games, but more complexity and better reception in the group.

This game involves programming actions into your hero, as your travel the kingdom recruiting armies and fighting monsters.

Gold, reputation and influence with the mage guild are your rewards. In the end, there can only be one Lord of Xidit!

Great production quality, great art and fantastic mechanics make for a really great game.

Loses one whole point for the overtly complicated set-up and village placing mechanics. Once you get going the game is pretty straightforward, so don't get scared by the rulebook.

I liked Himalaya, and I like this.  Fixes the biggest complaint of Himalaya, which was the die rolling.  I think I slightly prefer the theme of Himalaya, but in all other ways, this is better.  Very chaotic!  Do not play with players who cannot tolerate this.  I play with open gold holdings but with secret workers, which makes a decent balance.

Works wonderfully with four or five players, and makes a *great* first impression. Such initial positivism tends to be a warning sign when it comes to potential longevity, but I've got so many (too many) games that any game of mine at this point is unlikely to overstay its welcome.

Dummy player in a 3 player game is well implemented. Colorful art and theme is present only in the art. Programming board connector pieces are not durable or of sturdy quality like FFG material but the cardboard is good.

Simple programming game of planning ahead and guessing where your opponents are going. Rather large memory element but in this game it is forgivable due to the unique end game victory conditions.

This is a neat game but I think it probably looks better than it actually plays. I do enjoy a good programming game and this isn't bad (I think the fact it's set in the same universe as one of my favourites helps), but it's just lacking something. It needs a little more escalation I think, extra powers or something as the game goes on. Just a little expansion would REALLY help it out.

This is an action programming game with the beautiful board and production. I did enjoy myself quite a bit playing this game. I do think the ability to mess with the others players leaves the game a little more random than I would like. Would definitely play this again. I really like how the end scoring can be randomly chosen and that you need to do well in all three categories to win the game

Solid remake of the hard to find Himalaya.  Fun, breezy, chaotic pick up and deliver game.  Enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously, and leave your win-at-all-costs attitude at the door.  The changes improve the randomness of Himalaya, but the port of the theme to a silly fantasy world is a shame.

This is not the sort of game I would normally rave about.  It's not that great a game in pure gaming terms.  So why Game of the Month?  Because it was such a blast to play.  90 minutes flew by and it was entertaining from beginning to end.
Never having played a ‘programmed move’ game before I didn’t know what to expect.   So each player ‘programs’ their next 6 actions and then when ready you all reveal and the actions are executed around the table one action at a time.   The result is a riot of controlled chaos, unpredictability, and pure entertainment.  And tagged on to the end, and then becoming integral to the whole game, is a highly original and tense scoring system.  The scoring system deserves a mention: at the end of the game you score three types of thing that you have been collecting, each is scored one by one.  In a 5p game the last two players in the first scoring get eliminated, then the last player in the next scoring waves goodbye, and then the winner is the best of the two remaining for the final scoring.  So you don’t need to be best in any of them, so long as you aren’t last in any of them.  So if you enjoy a degree of chaos and can laugh at your failed attempts at second-guessing your fellow players, then there is much to love about this game. 
It stands out from the crowd as being something a little different and it plays in the 90 minutes stated on the box.  Entertaining and ka lot of fun.

RATING: 7.2
My favorite aspect of the game was gambling on what the other players were going to do.  In my first play-through, I managed to dominate all three scoring categories which is where the .2 comes from haha  However, I took several risks with programming my moves and really counted on other players being predictable in order to maximize my options (like collecting wizards).  At any time, someone could have done something unexpected and thrown me for a loop.  To that end, there is some interesting stuff going on the board and you are playing your opponents as much as you are playing the board.  A key part of this game is the randomized scoring categories - this really changes the way you approach the game and what you stock up on.

Great fun, but nothing overly spectacular.  Still, I'll gladly sit down and whoop some ass should the invite come.

Honorable mention for the game that caused one player to say, "the priest snuck one in."

The game is gorgeous and should be a winner, but I'm afraid there isn't much inside. The programming mechanic will turn off many people, be ready to occasionally do nothing for the round when a kink falls in your plans, not fun. OK, sure, maybe you enjoy a colossal amount of random effects, but Lords of Xidit tries to be this strategic mish-mash area control game that is inherently at odds. It is a lot work to find out e final score is often marred by more acts of chance.

Decent "Programming" game. I really liked the simple way that the moves were set up each turn. I found it easy and intuitive to understand and plan out the moves. 

The game are is good and the plastic pieces are great.

The only thing I didn't like was the end game victory condition. There is a series of eliminations and whoever is left wins. It's ok, just not interesting to me and the only confusing thing about the game. I would much prefer to see this game with a victory point motif.

I love the programming aspect of this game. It helps emphasize accurate planning/forecasting and allows players the ability to jostle for position, but also keeps the game moving at a very healthy clip. The strongest aspect of this game is the fabulous scoring mechanic, as balancing each of the scoring methods is both challenging and satisfying. However, the game boils down to a pick-up and deliver mechanic which doesn't intrigue me enough to encourage long-term investment.

Rating on one 5p game. I'm not a fan of chaos but the small amount here plays well in this one; it screws equally with everyone so it all evens out in the end. And is it possible for a game to be over balanced? In my game the top player out of the gate ended up at the bottom, and I didn't kill anything until second half yet finished near the top(?). Anyway, decent game that was compelling and fun throughout.

One other cool thing: the priority of the three scoring targets is random each game. Neat little twist that will keep the game somewhat fresh with repeated plays.

The b/f read the rules to this and this weekend we sat down to a three player game. 
Its really interesting there is nothing like this one in my collection despite lords borrowing mechanics heavily from other games.
The turn planned is very reminiscent of roborally but feels nothing like roborally. There are area control aspects with the bard tokens and the reputation track. You collect two of three resources when you defeat a creature and the end game mechanic is quite interesting with a player eliminated if he is the lowest in a chosen resource therefore you have to balance every action you take to ensure you do not neglect one of the aspects. 
The recruitmant mechanic is also quite unique. A city has 4-5 units upon it and you collect the weakest unit remaining when you recruit in the city. This mean you can wait for a turn to ensure a player after you recruits first getting the weaker unit and then you recruit the following turn getting the better unit.
I enjoyed this one and I am looking forward to more games of this in the near future.

Szeretem a programozós játékokat, itt különösen vonzott a sépci "pontozás" a játék végén.
A programozós résszel nincs is baj, persze be lehet szívni egy-egy akciót mások miatt, de ez nem volt vészes még öten sem. Viszont a pontozás végül nem tetszett. Szerintem teljesen feleslegesen vittek bele egy area influence elemet, ami átláthatatlanná és kezelhetetlenné teszi az egészet. Ha ehelyett valami set collection lenne, akkor sokkal-sokkal jobb játék lehetne, de így szinte képtelenség átlátni, hogy ki hogy áll, ráadásul nem is vagy rá túl nagy hatással, hogy hol tudsz újabb befolyást szerezni. A másik két pontozással nincs semmi baj, de lantos szerintem elrontja a játékot.

Lords of Xidit stays fairly close to its source material, Himalaya. That's a good thing as Himalaya is a very good game of majorities. Whether the few small tweaks and the transplanted setting are improvements or changes for the worse is probably a matter of taste more than anything else. Either way, they aren't substantial enough to result in a wildly different assessment.

Its attempt at a mechanical salad falls into the uncanny valley... the three different scoring systems are different enough to make learning hard, but ultimately they all feel the same. And speaking of things feeling the same, numbering the cities and enemies is a particularly soulless touch.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc de planificació simultanea on es tracta de moure't al voltant d'un mapa entre ciutats a través de camins reclutant unitats i derrotant enemics ("pagant" les unitats corresponents a canvi, tipus Lords of Waterdeep). La puntuació final va eliminant jugadors segons 3 "evaluacions" en un ordre que es decideix al atzar al principi de la partida (per exemple, primer s'evalua la quantitat de monedes que té cada jugador, i l'últim queda eliminat, de manera que ja no compta per la resta d'evaluacions).

M'ha agradat el sistema de puntuació final, tot i que e joc em sembla massa simple en alguns aspectes i que es pot fer repetitiu. Al programar 6 accions cada torn suposo que hi haurà molt caos, potser massa... L'estética tampoc em convenç gaire (tipus Seasons).

No descarto provarlo i que sigui entretingut, però no li veig gaire rejugabilitat, de manera que no m'interesa.

This is a game that test players ability to predict other players move or actions. An action dial with 6 possible moves is given to each player and presets those actions. Players can recruit, move, attack or do nothing. Players first have to recruit to attack monsters for area control rewards.

The top two players of each type of thing (money,castle,harp) will score

Cute miniatures and interesting scoring.

I don't think this game is for me though. While I've enjoyed some programmable movement games, I got frustrated when I was hoping to get to the town to recruit a monk or wizard (ie: some of the better recruits) but when it was time for everyone to execute their programmed actions, would frequently get the short end of the stick. I get that I could try to judge what the other players might or might do but it just made the game more frustrating than fun for me.

EDIT: Gave this game another try. Went into it with a different mindset--expect nothing. WOW! What a difference that made. Also looking ahead at what was coming helped too; I was able to head off to the next town and grab fresh recruits/kill a monster shortly after it spawned. When I realized I had was doing alright then I got a bit stressed out because the last few rounds I "needed" to recruit orange people [and there were none on the board at the moment], haha. So the secret is "expect nothing!" and you shall not get as frustrated.

This is really different! There's a little bit of a light pick-up-and-deliver game in here, with recipes (or "monsters") out on the board. There's certainly some trickiness in trying to get the more valuable dudes, because you have to wait for the worse ones to go.  I'm not sure how I feel about the endgame scoring--there are three possible categories, with a certain number of players getting eliminated in each category. (1 play)

Wonderfully fun game. Very simple to teach and get going. Some of the bookkeeping can be a little fiddly, but only one player needs to know that. The scoring is incredibly interesting and fun to wrap your head around. The game plays very differently based on the order of the scoring types. 

I honestly wish this had just been redone in the Himalaya theme with upgraded art and components. The Seasons-world theme doesn't do a lot for me, but that's a minor complaint.

Very easy to understand programming game set in its own fantasy universe.

Programming is done on a set of dials where you program your actions for an entire game year. You have to program around what other players might be doing as you may try to make your way over to a threat only to find someone else has already claimed it. You can use this to your advantage as well as you can see what's coming and try to make your way there to claim the threat or units.

The end game scoring is really interesting as it goes through a series of categories randomized at the beginning of the game where in order to proceed to the next round you just have to not be last (in gold, sorcery guilds, or area control). This makes the choices for threat rewards really important and changes from game to game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2015)

Some time ago I played Himalaya and I recognized it was a novel game, but I didn’t liked it much because it had a lot of uncontrollable luck, however Lords of Xidit removed that luck as now you will always know where the next troops/monsters will appear. I love this. I’m not sure about any other changes but now I’m interested in revisiting Himalaya to do a proper comparison.

In general, I’m not keen on the preprogramed movement mechanism but Lords of Xidit (and Himalaya) manages to pull it off nicely, it is, without a doubt, the best game in the genre out there. You have to (try to) predict your opponents actions to maximize yours.
 
The game components are gorgeous and they look great on the board. The rules are easy to explain, but the decisions aren’t easy or obvious. You have a lot to consider but, as every player plan at the same time, in theory the playtime doesn’t increase much with more players, this is a huge plus for me. It also has a cool memory aspect I enjoy as the troops are hidden. It is easy to lose a complete turn by a mistake, I love this but some friends dislike it. 

Best with 4 players.

I think the endgame goal variable order is new to the game, and if so, I approve with all my heart, this makes the game very different with each play.

Love the theme, I really like how Libellud created and encompassed themes from different games (Seasons) and I like that they share the art. I never cared for Himalaya´s theme.
 
Bottom line, Lords of Xidit is superior than Himalaya in every way (although the Himalaya Yaks were gorgeous too and Xidit´s are cardboard instead of minis), the production values are very high. I will buy it in the near future. I really liked Lords of Xidit so perhaps its rating will go up with more plays.
 
Current Rating: 7.0

According to my rules, Lords of Xidit shouldn’t be able to be eligible for my list of favorite games of 2014, however I’m making an exception here because the last incarnation (Himalaya) wasn’t liked by me. The change to remove the luck of the draw of the monster/troops affects the game positively and it is enough for me to differentiate the games in a big way. I don’t want to play Himalaya while I do want to play Lords of Xidit. So, to summarize, Lords of Xidit is eligible to participate in my main list of favorites 2014´s games.

Getting programmed-moves games right is challenge, but this one pulls it off. Some are just way too chaotic with insufficient ability to control what you do (hello Roborally with its cards - draw a pile of ones and minus-ones and you're in the hands of the gods), others too simple with the decisions being little more than stick or twist.

Here you have to plan 6 moves at a time in a pick up and deliver world taking into account what the others are up to. In general it's best to arrive at the pick up tiles after the other players as the later rewards to be collected on these tiles are better (but not too late as there are only 5 resources to collect per tile before it disappears), while you need to get to the deliver locations first as each can only be completed once before disappearing.

While early in the game which specific deliveries you complete doesn't matter too much, later in the game you need to be more judicious to avoid falling behind in any of the three scoring categories that decide the winner at game end.

Some reviewers/commenters have found it dry, but when we played it we all found it pretty engrossing.

Rulebook isn't a paragon of clarity, but it's pretty simple once you get it. Additionally, the more complex rules are the procedural ones around board refill as the pick up/deliver tiles are completed, so as long as one person knows these procedures it's not an issue.

I like the theme and art. I really like the victory condition as well. It is very unique and adds interesting elements to the strategy space. 

The programming actions is fun but can lead to severe consequences if someone acts in an unpredictable way. I like the struggle to plan and try to figure out what your opponents are going to do but I don't like how incredibly screwed someone can get if things go sideways.

Given the amount of chaos the game is too long. If it played in about an hour I would rate it more highly. The short game tries to address this but 9 rounds is still rather long given the amount of thought that has to be put into the programming each round. 10 minutes a round is not uncommon.

Basically still the same game as Himalaya which means it's a very good game. It also still has rough edges. While the random draw of Himalaya was replaced with a predictable apperance of new resources and creatures, the solution for refilling those is confusing and not elegant. Thematically, I like Himalaya's theme better but that's a matter of taste.

Fun game of programmed movement.  Make your best plans and hope they work out.  But it doesn't seem too chaotic which is good.  And since you only have to be "not last" then everyone has a fair chance at winning.  The occasional slow player will make the game last a little longer than it should but it doesn't seem to be too big of a problem.

Really dislike the silly fantasy theme and artwork but it doesn't overwhelm the gameplay.  Placing the little dudes on the city tiles is a bit tedious and though many praise the game for using minis instead of cubes, I would have preferred cubes.

01-07-2015 - Interesting game involving pre-programmed movement.  It was nothing like I expected it to be.  There aren't too many things you can possibly do, and the pre-programming once set removes the potential for AP (in most cases) so it ends up going pretty quick.  Need to play more.

Lords of Xidit features simultaneous programming and an elimination-based scoring system that leaves no room for complacency! In more detail, at the end of the game players compare their influence in one category and the player with the least influence is eliminated and his pieces removed from the board; players then compare influence in another category, with a player again being removed. The order of elimination is randomly determined at the start of play, forcing you to thinking in different ways each game.

Prepare to ride out, Idrakys, and forge your legend!

I really like Himalaya and I had been looking for a reprint long before the news of Xidit came.

Compared to Himalaya,
con:
*Larger board, harder to go to the other end
*harder to see majority points
*theme/look: missing the yaks and the routes are abstract
*planning boards: hard to see others' planned actions when revealed

*pro:
planning - you know where the "resource" figures are going and which ones are going to turn up
variable end game conditions
the random resource enemies
look: figures instead of cubes 

Overall I think it's about the same good as Himalaya was.

Gran juego que podríamos definir como una mezcla entre el Samurai y El Grande: El Grande por lo de controlar regiones (las fichas de bardo se reparten entre las diferentes regiones del reino de Xidit) y porque hay una región  central donde hay una fortificación donde se guardan fichas de bardo de manera secreta, al igual que la torre de El grande.
Se parece al Samurai en que no gana el jugador que tenga más recursos de uno de los 3 tipos existentes (monedas de oro, fichas de bardo, torres de hechicero), sino que hay que alcanzar un equilibrio  de los 3, pues hay un proceso de criba al final de la partida en el que resulta eliminado el jugador que menos recursos tenga de un tipo. Hay 3 recursos y por tanto, 3 fases de eliminación de jugadores, hasta llegar a una final entre 2 jugadores. 
La final la gana el jugador que tenga más del tipo de elemento seleccionado en último lugar.

El mecanismo de juego es muy diferente a todo lo que he jugado: cada jugador tiene un tablero y debe "programar" con antelación las 6 acciones que va a llevar en su turno. Me parece muy original.

El apartado estético del juego merece una mención especial: el colorido del gran tablero así como el dibujo de las fichas de monstruos. Muy bonito.
También incluye un buen número de fichas de ejércitos y demás componentes que no encarece el juego, que cuesta unos 40 euros.
Otro juego del mismo autor que el Seasons, otro gran juego que también está en mi colección y recomiendo encarecidamente.

Por poner algún defectos, le pongo 3:

1. No es un juego de acciones rápidas, hay que pensar con detenimiento y cautela las acciones que vamos a realizar en nuestro turno. Por tanto, tiene el consabido efecto de análisis/parálisis, que si juegas con personas muy lentas, pueden hacer alargar la partida y hacerlo algo aburrido al resto de jugadores.
De todas maneras, el juego incluye una versión más corta de 9 turnos,en lugar de 12. Se puede elegir.

2. La interacción entre jugadores es escasa: Cada jugador se enfrasca en las acciones que va a realizar en su propio turno y las posibilidades de "puteo" son pocas, aunque puede darse el caso de que un jugador en su turno de adelante a la acción que otro jugador quería realizar.

3. Es a partir de 3 jugadores, y se necesita un "jugador fantasma" para llegar a la cifra de 4 jugadores. Este jugador fantasma lo pueden utilizar el resto de jugadores humanos para intentar perjudicar y eliminar al resto de sus rivales en las eliminaciones finales del juego. Es, por tanto, otro factor estratégico a tener en cuenta en la partida.
El juego está pensado para partidas de 4 y 5 jugadores, que deben ser muy interesantes aunque quizá algo caóticas (no lo he probado aún), pero con 3 jugadores el juego funciona estupendamente.


De todas maneras, estos 3 "peros" no le quitan el menor interés al que en mi humilde opinión es un gran juego, original, sesudo, vistoso, muy rejugable y adictivo.

RATING: 6
While this game's pick up and deliver doesn't really fit the theme of the game at all (in fact, the old delivering of goods theme probably fit the theme better), the minis in this game are still a really nice touch, and the artwork of the world of Seasons is great (not to mention the giant board). Barring the mechanics/theme not matching that well, this game's action programming creates interaction by trying to guess what your opponents will do, and causes you to sometimes want to waste actions so that your opponent will pick up a less desirable unit, allowing you to get the unit you want. Also, it means that if for some reason you need to multitask after a person has programmed their actions they technically don't need to be at the table to resolve the actions unless they fight a monster.

The unique scoring mechanic at end of game adds tension since you never know who exactly is winning the game. However, it's a bit too much hidden information for me.

The census at the end of each 4 years makes decisions even harder because saving units when you could be defeating monsters could potentially waste actions, yet the census bonuses are pretty nice.

There's a tad of area control/majority with the scoring of the bard tokens and blocking people off with your towers, and this area control also incentivizes to move around more on the board instead of just sticking in one corner.

This game is pretty easy to teach.

The dummy player when playing with 3 players is definitely not ideal, but it doesn't make the game terrible. Definitely better with more, but I would play again with 3.

EDIT: Games started to feel samey, and I'm getting pretty burned out on Euros with poorly implemented themes. While technically no two games are the same, there's no real different combos to try or anything just do a little bit more or less of something. Finally, the final scoring while unique is really stressful, and while forcing you to diversify and hiding who is the true winner I still think is stressful unnecessarily so.

Not quite a family weight game, but can be played with a family who really play hobby games or if one player knows the rules well.  Game turns start with programming your moves to move along three different color paths and either picking up resources or fighting monsters.  After defeating a monster you can choose 2 of 3 available rewards.  These rewards are scored at the end of the game.  The end game scores different rewards and eliminates the player who did the worst in that area.  You then score the next track and eliminate the lowest player. You will have two players remaining for final track and the best score wins.  

Only good with either 4 or 5 players.  Bad with 3 players.

Lovely fun game that can be completed in 1.5 hours. requires planning and luck as well as an appreciation of where you need to be in 6 moves time. Rewards are money, prestige or buildings gained from killing monsters with troops recruited from various towns. Love the way the board's geography changes but the final winning tally is a cruel knockout and you have to balance what you collect. Simple concept but a lot going on and as I say great fun.

Quick, the right play length with the option to lengthen or shorten gameplay.  Interactive without being directly confrontational.  You play with others (not MPS) and there are many opportunities to laugh when your plans don't quite turn out as planned because the other players did not do what you expected them to.  The playing board is clear, beautiful, and has little useful reminders and instructions well integrated in the graphics.  A terrific game.

Movement programming game with area majority and my favorite end game scoring. Scoring happens in 3 categories, money, area control, mage spires, the order of which is randomly decided at the start of the game. In each category the last (and optionally second to last) player is eliminated, the third scoring category decides about the winner. So if money is the last category to score, you might get eliminated in a previous scoring although you have the most money.
Horrible artwork.

Because of the unique scoring, you have to be very strategic and not only think about your move, but think about everyone else's move at the same time.

Components are outstanding - though the figures are a little fiddly. I like the changes they made to the mechanics of Himalaya, but I preferred the old theme.

I wanted to like this game more than I did.  The movement programming is easy to understand, use, and can be very tense.

Great game that some of my more casual game friends love.  The program mechanic is fun and not too confusing.  I think the number of monsters and cities can get a little confusing for placing them down and making sure the game stays balance.  A great time, but it requires a little more attention then a typically weighted game.

Initial play left a great impression. A little bit of chaos (nothing like robo rally) and second guessing, but really about chasing goals around the board while simultaneously competing for majorities and very creative scoring.

Quite a neat little game!! A fair bit going on, have to keep track of the three score tracks, being bottom of any of them means your out, which is a cool scoring system I haven't seen else where. Programming makes this a little bit chaotic, turns will be ruined by other people, which again, I think is cool.

After a second play with 5.
Really dig this game! Titans came out which added a nice catch up and they work well!

A good programming type game, but there is a lot going on to keep track of so it is better played on BoargdGameArena.com rather than on tabletop

Still, worth playing if you have a couple of hours to spare and have 5 players (I think playing with less wouldn't be as good)

Ami tetszik benne:
- a programozott lépéstervezés,
- a kis figurák (valahogy ebben a játékban jobban esik figurákat pakolgatni színes fakockák helyett),
- az egyedi pontozás,
- hangulata, látványvilága,
- magas újrajátszhatósága.

Ami nem tetszik benne:
- a magas szerencsefaktor már ingerküszöb felett van,
- a túlbonyolított veszély- és toborzás korong menedzsment (még második játéknál is a szabálykönyvet bújtuk, hogy melyik esetben hogyan kell pakolgatni őket),
- első játék előtti set-up: mire minden alkatrész kinyomásra kerül a nyomótáblákból és az 5x6 tárcsa is felrögzítésre kerül a játékosok konzolaira, valamint a szortírozás is megtörténik, már el is ment jó fél óra, pedig még szabálymagyarázat sem volt...

Összegzésül: a játék nagyon hangulatos, biztosan előkerül még, ha négyesben szeretnénk valamivel játszani, ami nem hardcore euró. Ha a szerencse szerepét csökkenteni lehetett volna, biztosan jobban szeretném és legalább 0.5 ponttal magasabbat is adtam volna neki.

I have not played Himalaya but have always wanted to.  For my money, I much prefer the original theme, even though I did enjoy Seasons and loved the artwork.  But in this case, the art and the Seasons theme are pretty incidental.  

However, it is a smooth, well-designed game.  To me, it felt like RoboRally meets El Grande.  In the beginning, it seemed a little chaotic, but after a while my strategy of "doing the opposite" of what was expected was successful.  The dials work well and the board is pretty clear, although a color-blind friend did have an occasional blunder so I'm not sure if the colored roads were different enough.  The game-play is pretty straight-forward -- secretly order six moves on your dial which can consist of: traveling from a city in 1 of 3 directions, taking the action of a city with a tile (either to collect a fighter, or fight an enemy with fighters already collected), or do nothing (wait).  The fighters that you collect are actually pretty abstract, somewhat like the cubes in Lords of Waterdeep (although they are represented by awesome little plastic figures in 5 different molds).  Their value is tiered increasingly so you're always trying to pick them up after your opponents.  To fight an enemy, you must have the exact combination of fighters required, and then you collect 2 of the 3 available resources in varying amounts.  

After 12 rounds, it only comes down to the 3 resources you were attempting to collect.  One is guilds, another is money, and a third is bard tokens which you place around the board in area-control style.  At the beginning of the game, the 3 scoring systems/resources are ordered randomly so that everybody knows which scoring will happen first (but every game will be different).  Whoever has the least is knocked out of the running.  Then the next scoring happens and the least is knocked out, and finally the last scoring.  In our game, for example, we scored guilds, then bards, then money.

I also found the way the city tiles came in and out of play interesting.  When you take all the fighters from a city tile, it then flips to the opposite side which has an enemy to fight which will eventually probably cycle back onto the board to a city location.  And vice versa.  When the enemy is fought it will then cycle back as a tile in which you can collect fighters.

Although I don't prefer the retheme, I found this an enjoyable game.  I look forward to trying it with more or less players (we had 4).

second hand

Seems to work best with 4 players - Lords of Xidit clearly borrows its mechanisms from a mix of different games i.e. the castillo from El Grande, the programming from Roborally, movement and set collection, hidden bidding etc. Most of the times it doesn't work in the end but this time it does! Even if you do well in 2nd and 3rd rounds, you might even not participate for the end victory if you lose in the 1st challenge. Clever end game scoring, a bit resembling Knizia's worst color counts! 

The board game components and board are very nice and you could easily tell that they are from the same artists and designer as Seasons.

I highly recommend this game, the only downside is that you need at least 3 players and even better 4 to shine.

The programming is fun and the art and pieces are cute, but it's not an especially flavourful game otherwise (defeating random numbered monsters and getting troops from random numbered cities). The scoring conditions and the uncertainty around tracking hidden info are so complicated that I find it easier just to try scoring decently in all three categories rather than directly compete. The dummy player in 3p games adds an extra headache.

I like the end game scoring mechanism which means that for the first two criteria you survive if you are not the lowest and for the final criterion you need to be the highest. But, in my only game (so far) it felt too long with rounds alternating between picking up resources and killing monsters. Underneath the good production quality lies a fairly dated feeling pick up and deliver game.

Really nice program your movements aspect, much better implemented than Roborally. You definitely vs the other players as you must gamble on what they do. However, this introduces luck as someones gamble will pay off fantastically, while others will be significantly disadvantaged. You can also become stuck in the game as scoring points requires gathering certain types of fighter resources that you may never get. End game scoring and elimination is very unique and fun: ensures you must have a balance of cities, bards and treasure. However, this does mean that there are not multiple paths to victory.

RATING: 7
Great component design, but in practice somewhat fiddly for a Euro with dozens and dozens of pieces to move around the board. The movement programming mechanism is not nearly as brain burning as it can be in other games, which keeps this feeling nice and light. As such the emphasis is on guessing the moves of other players instead of meticulously devising a master plan in a vacuum. The scoring mechanism is clever, although I'm not sure it's improved by having one of the categories (the gold) hidden and the others easily trackable.

Simultaneous programming game (RoboRally, River Dragons) with an elegant and streamlined indirect conflict mechanic. I like the wicked elimination-style endgame scoring, but it's a little too wicked for a 1.5 hour game. I'd advise doing what needs to be done to keep it to an hour -- either playing the shortened game or putting out the timer on a first play. It's got a high fun factor but might seem a little samey on subsequent plays, so the paradox might be that it's only good for first plays.

With 3 players there is dummy player - a mechanic I don't like a lot. Also 4+ players probably would've been better.

It's Himalaya on steroids. Very similar route-planinng but more rules and more fiddly parts. I'm still not sure if i like this "last player in category is out" -scoring as it is tedious to track you're true position during game.

[b]Lords of Xidit[/b]

[i]The scoring mechanic feels like an inelegant Knizia solution to scoring. For example in Tigris your score is the lowest total among all four colors; simple and brilliant [i](in my opinion)[/i]. This is something you have direct control over and can plan for.
In Xidit you score three different resources (fame, gold and buildings), but in the beginning of the game you randomly decide an order that they are placed in [i](first, second, third)[/i].
Then the person with the lowest total of the first resource is eliminated from the game. 
You score the second resource and again the person with the lowest total is eliminated.
Finally the winner is determined by having the most of the third resource.
The problem is that there are situations where you know you need a certain resource, but you just can't get it. I understand that this scoring system adds tension to the game, but at the cost of simplicity and elegance. Why not adopt the scoring system found in Tigris, your score is the resource you have the least of.

Overall I really had fun playing the game, and I especially enjoyed having to plan out 6 moves at a time and then see how things worked out based on other peoples actions. In the end though, after playing a game for a few hours it really feels crappy getting eliminated from any possibility of winning because of a convoluted and wonky scoring system.[/i]

So funny the first time we played this game, my wife had just taken some medicine for her cold and she was literally falling a sleep at the table. This could have been the best game in the world and i don't think it would have mattered in her current state. Anyway I ended up playing both her and my turns. My own character ended up winning much to my surprise. I think this is a super cool game and I don't have a programming game in my collection yet, i like the theme of this as i am a seasons fan so this is probably better than the game it was rebooted from for that alone. The scoring mechanism is awesome, be good at each thing not always great at any one thing. Though to be fair the scoring is accomplished the same way, by attacking monsters, so its not fair to say there is really different routes to victory. I really screwed up the placement and usage of tiles during the game which made it a little chaotic but we made due and still saw the game as quite good.

RATING: 7
Satisfying pickup-and-deliver game with monsters. So Euro mechanics with an Ameritrash theme on top. I wasn't expecting much because the art is meant to appeal to a younger, non-gamer crowd who are lured by the idea of fighting monsters and growing an army. The game isn't really any of that, to be honest. It's less aggressive (there's no player interaction) and warlike, and more of a tactical strategy game. There is simultaneous action selection (which cuts down on some of the AP) and its only twelve short turns. The scoring mechanic at the end can be a little unforgiving but I wouldn't know how to change that. Overall, an enjoyable game that has terrible artwork but solid mechanics. I resist anything Paulo likes because we have such different tastes. But this eventually won me over.

I found this surprisingly enjoyable for a dodgy-theme game. I've always liked programming games and this does it nicely, with just enough information to provide intel on what might happen this turn, but with some trackable hidden information (which you wouldn't bother tracking) creating some tension on what other people might do to potentially upset your plan. Upon which you can make a decision to plan safely or riskily. I was impressed by the way the city tiles alternated between getting resources and providing rewards, and I enjoyed the newness of the knockout win conditions over the 3 different races at the end of the game, providing enough freshness to entertain us. A second play for me highlighted that each play is going to be much of the same though, and as long as you're doing appropriate look-ahead and risk assessment of other players options, there's not too much clever you can do - try and note what other people can/can't do, collect as best as on offer, and convert it into rewards as best as on offer. So I feel like I’ve explored it enough after 2 plays and am happy to move on, but would also happily play it if someone wanted to explore it.

I love programmed movement games.  I'm terrible at playing them, but I love them, just the same.  I love how, at the end of the game, where if you are the last place person for a given consideration, you are eliminated from winning.  Someone once said, "You don't have to have the most of the first two considerations, only 'enough'."  Figuring out how much is 'enough', though, is the whole key, especially if you can't directly calculate how much your opponents have in a given category.  :)  It's a completely brilliant concept!

Everybody programs his actions and then tries to pick-up (= recruit units) or deliver (= fight monsters). The trying is due to the fact that if someone takes the last unit or fights the monster before you, you will have nothing and wasted at least 2 actions (1 movement and 1 recruiting/fighting action). 

What you should take into account (and I neglected completely during our game :s), is that you know the next location of the 'future' monster or recruiting place. So if you think someone will empty a recruiting tile or fight a monster, it's smart to go over there if you're in the neighbourhood.

I seem to be the only one in my group that likes this game. I do prefer the Himalayan theme of its predecessor, but Lords of Xidit is the better game mechanically. Having foresight to what monster/city tiles will be coming out is clever and helps when planning out a move.

The most novel part was the tiered scoring mechanic. It added a layer of tension where you have to balance your points so you don't fall last in the earlier scorings. Programing 6 movements at a time was interesting, forcing you to make some guess when there was contention. However, it could really hose you if you guess wrong. 
It is more pick up and deliver than fighting monsters, but along with the census for scoreing what you have on hand keeps a balance of using your resources for fighting or alternate scoring. There is a bit of area majority with the scoring for the hero tokens and towers which makes you want to move around rather than mine one area. 

Thinking about it I would only play with 4 players

Programmed movement is tricky to implement without players feeling like they're "riding the fail train" when someone beats them to the place they want to go. Thankfully, this game makes it so that this is a calculated risk rather than just something that can happen.

At first glance, Xidit seems very very simple, and the core game mechanics really are very easy to learn/teach despite the overly complicated rulebook, but this is a game about playing the other players more than the game mechanics. There is A LOT to keep track of once things get going, especially if you are playing with a large group. Basically, you cannot win if you place last in any of the three scoring categories, but that requires a keen eye and memory. The theme also helps bring this game to life, even though most of the art is borrowed from Seasons (but what a beautiful game to borrow from!) I only wish the Sleeping Titans were named something else or they were more difficult to defeat. The name implies they are some terrible threat with a great reward for defeating them, but they are merely a consolation prize for losing your action to another player or a last ditch effort to get a few more points when other scoring methods are too far out of reach.

The mid game is quite interesting.  You sometimes second guess other players, you need to start completing quests while still collecting stuff, and you should start to secure tower positions.

The late game is extremely frustrating.  Just finish quests whenever possible.  Hope the randomness of where things spawn and whether your resources match works out.  Often, feel locked out because randomness doesn't go your way.  Maybe do some kingmaking or just flail wildly and pray.

Also, hidden trackable information galore and yet there is still irritating math towards the end.  This game seems to have squarely landed in the 'worst of both worlds' camp on that debate.

RATING: 5
Just a bad mixture of good mechanisms that's worse than the sum of its parts. The programming is very predictable and completely lacks the fun of RoboRally - getting your sequence messed by a push beats a wasted turn because someone beat you to a key resource or threat. The area majority is much less interesting than El Grande. The variable sequencing of which scoring will be done first, with the losing players being eliminated no matter how well they're doing on the other scoring, is quite interesting, but it makes what you need to go for very predictable. Gold is hidden but easily trackable since it's not spent, tower amounts change by small amounts, and the locations of the threats overly dictate where you can place tokens to compete for majority, so there's just not a lot you can do if you are losing to change anything.

RATING: 7.75
The programming mechanic feels well-executed in this game.  There is no question that players will be thinking hard about what their opponents are going to do, and trying to outmaneuver them is entertaining.  The available actions are interesting enough, though they aren't particularly thrilling and sometimes don't uphold the theme very well (why is a powerful Mage useless against this monster which can be defeated by a couple of Farmers?).  

The victory mechanic is very interesting.  I think I'll always enjoy the endgame evaluation, whether I win or lose, but I also feel that planning to win, if you want to really optimize your last several turns, requires such convoluted thinking ("To win, I must do better at X than the player who was not the worst at Y, and better at Y than the player who was not the worst at Z, etc...") that I will generally just play this game with a vague mindset of "do decently in each category".

RATING: 6
I find serious programmed movement games (i.e. not RoboRally or the like) somewhat lackluster and this one does nothing to change that.  It was alright, but it is hard to feel too strategic when someone does (what seems to be) a suboptimal move and ends up taking your resource/monster/etc.  They don't maximize their points, they screw you up, and you end up not doing much on your turn as a result.

That isn't to say this was awful.  I had an okay time and it had fun artwork, but I likely wouldn't play it again.

A beautiful looking game that plays very well too. The board looks big but it's very easy to move around it quickly when trying to keep up with the ever changing recruitment and threat tile placements. The programmed turns play out quickly and offer much hilarity and gnashing of teeth when things don't go to plan, though there is an opportunity for a bit of AP during the actual programming. The player elimination at the end-of-game scoring is a great way to finish and builds tension nicely.

There is nothing I don't love about this game. I love the programming trying to out guess your opponents and also trying to throw a monkey wrench or two in their plans, while also planning for the next recruitment station or monster that hits the board (the true separation between expert and novice). It's a great balance of simplicity and complexity and the winning conditions are an absolute stroke of genius, how they are different order each game, how you go from one to the next eliminating the person who finished last. That surprise of "WOW I WON!" makes the whole thing fun. It also has one of the better "dummy player" systems I've seen, as you can actively utilize the dummy as part of your strategy.

Nagyon régen játszottam már a régi verziójával, a Himaláyával így csak a korábbi beírásomra tudok hagyatkozni, hogy a két játék szinte semmiben nem tér el. Amiben biztos, az a három játékos verzió, amihez ügyesen kitaláltak egy NPC-t, ami teljesen jól működik, így a pontozás a 4-5 játékos változatéhoz hasonlóan megy. Apropó 5 játék, az előddel max. 4-en lehetett játszani csak. Ebben a játékban embereket bérelünk fel, akik szörnyeket ölnek meg, az előd kiszállítósdi megoldásához képest. A játék nagyon szép, jól átlátható, amit korábban a Himalayánál ellentétesen megjegyeztem. Szebb pálya, jó működés 3-an és még 5-en is játszható, viszont a szerencse rendesen szerepet játszik és kicsit talán hosszabb a kelleténél. Marad a Himalaya pontja.

Amazing mechanics meshing together to make each play memorable.  You are constantly watching the other players - second guessing their plans ... while trying to distract others with your plans.

Already a classic for me

A quality reprint of the classic Himalaya. I like pretty much everything about this new version: the bits are all nicer, except that the player pieces themselves should have been mini-figures rather than standup cardboard pieces. It's still essentially the same great game: programming routes performing pick-up-and-deliver across the board, area control in the various areas and player elimination in the endgame. I do miss the chaos generated by actually removing eliminated players' pieces while evaluating later endgame criteria, though. Nevertheless, there's some nice variability in changing up the order of endgame variations, and the pieces used to supply the figures and provide threats to accomplish are much better than having a die roll determine where to place the pieces.

RATING: 7
This is a hidden programmed movement game somewhat in the vein of something like RoboRally set in the world of Xidit, the same one used in the game Seasons.  The thematic relation is the only thing this game shares with Seasons though.  In this game players will secretly choose 6 actions, they are moving across 3 different colored paths, recruiting units or using their collected units to defeat threats, or simply waiting.

When a threat is defeated, you collect 2 of 3 different rewards.  The game is decided at the end by process of elimination.  First the lowest player in one of these 3 goal categories is eliminated, then the lowest of the players left in the next category is eliminated as well, and finally the lowest of the third category from the 2 players left in the final round is eliminated.

This game has room to be incredibly strategic depending on how much you want to devote to that.  Movements are carried out in player order, so much like a faster robot can push you into a pit in RoboRally, in this game a player acting before you can take the last unit on a recruitment spot or defeat a threat before you get there wasting your action if you try to do one of these things and there is no tile available.  You can also see the next two recruitment and threat locations in the queue at all times and plan for that as well as keep track of where each player is in the ranking of the 3 scoring criteria.  After all, in the first two elimination rounds you don't need the most, just not the least.  And in the final round you simply need more than the other guy left.

This is incredibly deep with some awesome colorful well-made components done in the same art style of Seasons, which if you read my comments on that game you'll know I love the artwork.  While this is also a 90-120 minute game it also, to me, doesn't feel that long.  Players are pretty frequently involved and playing this game well means constantly paying attention to the ever-changing board state.  I also think, despite some somewhat convoluted and fiddly rules with the tile queues, as long as an experienced player handles that the rest of the game is very accessible.

The one thing keeping me from really loving this game though is that while something like RoboRally (which also has its problems) is incredibly thematic and makes me feel like I'm actually programming a robot, I don't get that here.  This is incredibly abstract, you just put different kinds of tokens down in different places when you accomplish a goal.  I'm not particularly a fan of overly abstracted games, after all, but the depth and interaction this game does offer elevates it above others.  It just also keeps it from flying too high in my eyes as well.

I did not want to like Lords of Xidit (AKA Merchants of the Empire 3.0; AKA Himalaya 2.0) as much as I do.  First off, I hate the name and feel that it is going to hurt game sales because people like me who want to sing its praises can never remember what the game is called!  (I know they wanted an anagram of "Dixit" to tie it into another popular game that the company produces, but that reason is just as dumb as the name itself.)  When I saw the box cover, I immediately hated the new theme and the weird illustration style.  Why oh why would they take a refreshingly original theme like moving caravans of yaks around the Himalayas and make yet another generic fantasy game?!  (Again, I know that they wanted to keep it in the "world" of Seasons to tie it into yet another popular game that they make, but I didn't enjoy Seasons at all and certainly didn't see any sort of interesting theme coming through in that particular game.)  But then the box was opened, a beam of light shone forth, a rainbow formed over the gaming table, I saw the beautiful (and visually very clear!) board and all those cute little plastic minis, and I started to warm up to the game.  Then I played it and, despite the misgivings about changing my beloved Himalaya, I loved it and immediately recognized that, while they did make some fairly extensive changes to that game, it did not lose the overall feel and pretty much all of the changes did improve the play experience.  After three unique editions, the design has gotten fairly tight!  Now I love the physical production of the game (though I still think that some of the monster illustrations in particular could have been more interesting); a lot of smart decisions were made to improve ease of play for the players, and those planning dials in particular are genius!!  But why on earth (or whatever planet that is) did they produce all those plastic minis, only to make the 5 main heroes that move about the map cardboard standees?!  Such a missed opportunity!  And there's also the confusing bit about flipping and moving and flipping again those circle tiles when stacks run out.  But what it comes down to is this: I'll be selling my coveted copy of Himalaya and purchasing... what's this game called?... Seasons of Dixit??... because it is more fun, more strategic, and has a higher replay value.  I'll miss my yaks, though thankfully they still provided one to my black player!

A solid smooth gameplay experience. Think Robo Rally + Waterdeep but with much less plan derailment and sniping. Whereas Robo Rally is known for frustration, this game has almost none. Effectively a 4-player only game as the dummy player is a speedbump to an otherwise incredibly fluid experience. Fun and satisfying. Wish I could play it more often, but the 4-player requirement can be a challenge.

I have owned [thing=3800][/thing] for years, but every time we thought about playing it, we only had 3 players, and since we hate dummy players, we always played something else. And after some time we forgot about it. But a new edition is always a good excuse to play an older game.
In this game you program 6 moves which you use to walk around, grab resources and kill bad guys. Of course timing is very important here. The order in which you do things depends heavily on what spot in turn order you occupy. A fun puzzle to figure out.
While the programming aspect is something that we still don't see often, the other elements of the game give it a bit of that classic game feel. And while thematically you are slaying bad guys, it's not really a fighting game. You move to the bad guy and chose to pay the required resources to kill him or simply move on. So it's like completing orders. Wait, that probably was the old theme :)
I found this to be a solid design with some novel mechanisms.

Perfectly decent, but I'll stick to River Dragons; it is a lot more fun.

Gyönyörűszépen kivitelezett szállítós játék. A táblán lévő állomásokon vagy összeszedsz valamit, vagy leraksz valamit. Minden állomáson vagy valamiket le kell rakni, vagy fel lehet venni. Csak akkor teljesíthetek küldetést (ez a lerakás), ha minden megvan, ami az állomáshoz szükséges. Ha meg felveszel, akkor csak egy dolgot lehet felvenni, és minél később veszel fel cuccot valahonnan, annál értékesebbet kapsz.

Mindemellé 6 lépést titkosan tervezel előre, amit aztán egyenként léptek le. Tehát ha valaki hamarabb odaért mint te, akkor az övé a küldetés, de ugyanakkor ha felvevős állomáson történik ugyanez, akkor a tied az értékesebb cucc.

Node nem ám csak egyszerúen győzelmi pontot gyűjtünk, hanem egyenesen három féle győzelmi pontot. A játék végén sorban megnézzük, hogy ki miben a legjobb. Aki az első kritérium szerint utolsó, kiesik. Ezután többiek közül a második kritérium szerinti utolsó is kiesik. Majd a bentmaradottak közül az aki a harmadik kritérium szerint első, az nyert.

I didn't know much about this game, but I knew it had programmed actions.  I love [thing=18][/thing] for the programming, although this doesn't have the real time aspect.

:star: Components are high quality
:star: Virtually no downtime

[b]Cons:[/b]
:nostar: Occasionally decisions can be obvious
:nostar: Sometimes you can get totally screwed because someone messed up one of your actions (not necessarily a negative to me, but maybe to some)
:nostar: End game scoring can be pretty swingy, especially if it comes to tiebreakers

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
I was pleasantly surprised by [thing=156566][/thing].  I expected to like it because of the programmable actions, which are done well.  But the victory mechanic was also very unique and created for some tense gameplay.  For those that don't know, there are basically three scoring tracks.  At the beginning of the game, the tracks are put in a random order.  At the end of the game, whoever has the least of the first category is eliminated.  Then whoever remaining has the least of the second category is eliminated, then the same for the third category.  So you wanted to focus on the last category, but needed to not get eliminated by the first two.

This is a solid game.  I almost never buy non-coops that don't play well with 2 people anymore, but I would consider picking this up for the right price or in a trade.

Good four-player-only game (the three player game is a variant and I've heard that the five-player game isn't very good). Would need to play some more to see how my rating changes, but there's a lot to like.

The production is just fantastic. Bright, colorful art all over the place and plastic miniatures where cubes would have been sufficient. The player screens are nice and sturdy. Just a great production all around.

The gameplay is fun. You program six moves at a time and you have to be careful because other players might beat you to your destination before you get there, leaving you with nothing. So you have to try to outguess your opponents and sometimes push your luck, hoping the next player isn't going after the same thing that you want.

Good game, but more plays could make my rating go either way.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4-5[/b]
You need more players because of the way final scoring works, and also just for the competition and double-guessing of moving around the board.

This game really deserves more credit for how much fun it is to play. The mechanics are very smooth and the entire game is a elegant as it is colorful and pretty.

Even if you make a programming mistake it doesn't hinder gameplay for long, and the scoring mechanic always keeps you guessing what people are doing for victory.

My only comment is that it is hard to get your towers out after people start putting them out. So do that early and have a good balance between the three conditions and you will likely do well.

For 3 and 2 player games there is an AI who is actually very easy to manage, and can be used to leaver your opponents out of the game if they are lacking on one of the win conditions. However if people are wanting to fight each other more you could simply buff up the last win condition and forgo the first one to make sure it is eliminated first, but I feel that make the game lose some of its strengths. 

Over all this is a must buy for those people looking for a quick and colorful adventure.

Changes from Himalaya appear to be a mild but relevant improvement across the board.  Basic gameplay has the same nice programming tension and gives a solid bunch of decisions in an appropriate timeframe.

What a slick and enjoyable game! Surprisingly easy to teach despite it's daunting appearance and lengthy rulebook.  The game moves along briskly while jogging your brain in a fun, original way.  

I can understand the comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep after playing, it almost feels like a fully fresh take on the same game.  Something that I feel more enjoyable and engaging than alternating worker placement turns. 

Whether or not it has the lasting power is yet to be determined.

Fairly good game. Not a ton of other options for programmed movement that work as well as this. 

My main attraction is the scoring mechanic, but the game is pretty long to be sitting there and waiting for that cool part.

Lords of Xidit is a far less complicated version of Roborally. Players preplan five moves and then sit back and laugh as they all go horribly wrong. Unlike Roborally however, the player pieces are on rails and movement is point to point, so play is brisk and there is never any chance of finding yourself bored and pinned in a corner.

Instead of collecting flags, in Xidit players are collecting soldiers, which they then use to slay monsters. They are then rewarded with two of three different resources, which are collected or deployed in order to pursue the game's victory conditions.

The end game is by far the most interesting aspect. Players are judged on the success of their resource collection, one category at a time, in a random order determined at the start of the game. After the first comparison, the lowest ranking player(s) is eliminated. After the second, another is removed from the competition. The third and final comparison determines the winner. This unique scoring system makes claiming monster rewards a delightful game of chicken. Do I lock down the third category so I only have to barely survive the first two? Do I try to go big on the first two challenges and hope to eliminate the player that has a big lead in the third category, kicking them out so that their big score doesn't even matter?

I think Roborally is a great concept that works better on paper than in practice. Lords of Xidit does not suffer the same problem and performs exactly as you would expect. Lots of frustrations and lots of laughs at those frustrations.

Always wanted to try Himalaya for its mechanics of elimination in stages in the end. I wasnt disappointed by that, the mechanic is really interesting. The componenents in LoXidit are also wonderful.
Unfortunately in 5 players there's a lot of chaos and the game is scarcely controllable. I'd like to try it again with less players, probably 4 because i dont like the idea of a "robot" player around.
The setup is quite long.

I like the idea of programming games, RoboRally being one of the few I've played with that mechanism. However, RoboRally can be both hilarious and frustrating depending on the other players and the shuffle of the cards. 

Lords of Xidit on the other hand has the programming without the chaos. Your options are always available, but you may get to a spot either too early or too late and that's where the game comes in: do you activate your spot immediately or wait for someone else to activate (waiting to activate can let you get a stronger unit)? I'm very much looking forward to trying this again, but I'll probably avoid three player games since it requires a dummy player.

We are noble heirs of a corrupted fantasy kingdom competing to defeat a common threat--the Black Southern Host(?). Simultaneous programmed actions and movement to build forces of bards and wizards to reclaim overtaken human cities. I guess the trick is to out guess where the other players are going so that you get there first, purposely arrive later, or go a different route. The victory goes to the player who was NOT lowest in a successive elimination of scoring paths of castle tokens and stacked wizard towers.

This game had some very interesting mechanics. It's not about being best in some areas, it's about not being last in everyone, except the last category. It also had nice interaction between the players since you had to program your moves and try and calculate what everyone else intends to do. Beautiful game too. Big surprise for me.

I have so much fun playing this game. A wonderful use of programming, beautiful production and fun scoring system makes this one of my faves to play. I usually like heavier euro games but this is just a blast. I do though suspect that I have developed a liking for programming games so maybe not so good if you don't like those.
Rating based on 4-5 players and only a couple of games so not sure about longevity yet.
EDIT:
After a few plays the novelty is wearing off. I still enjoy it but reduced rating from 8.9 to 8

The game certainly feels and works uniquely. But it is very mechanic. You are so into programming and analyzing best ways to get tokens to get other tokens, that theme has no chance to pop out. Programming is interesting (and anticipating other players turns, also looking forward and anticipating how board will change). But this game is also very prone to AP. In overall it is fun to play and twist your brain by figuring out how to win all 3 titles at the end (not to lose to be exact), also it involves memory aspect, by memorizing how many money others get or how many bard tokens they've dropped into the Bastion. But it feels too dry and too clunky to enjoy it more. And certainly only the short game to go!

Wonderful and refreshing concept. I know it' snot completely original, but it's done better than I have seen before. Only reason it doesn't get a 10 for me is because you need at least 3 players and even then it's done with a "dummy player". I understand why you need 4... but it's still makes the game tough to play as 4 human players is really where this game shines. Would love to see some expansions for this game.

5.5 after 1 play.

Gameplay was uninspiring with little direct interaction between players. There also wasn't many alternatives if your desired action was blocked out by another player taking that action first. The "wait" action also doesn't seem like it is needed in the game.

It is also quite fiddly as players have to remember to add new territories with new armies to recruit and new monsters as they get removed.

fantasy themed pick-up-and-deliver in the "Seasons" universe... very cool game, but very frustrating with all the intentional and unintentional blocking... the miniatures are fantastic, but completely unnecessary; they could've been cubes and it would've been just fine...

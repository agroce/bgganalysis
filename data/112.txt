I wanted to like this game but it failed me. It's unplayable with 2, it's poor with 3 but I can imagine it doing well with 4+.

Concept, artwork, box are all great... but it doesn't work with 2-3 players. Perhaps someone is willing to redesign it.

If you want majority control, get El Grande. 
If you want a portable card game, there are many to choose from.

Nice game of battling territories.  My only reservation is the mechanic that the person with the most territories starts the next round with the largest hand.  Gives it a bit of a "Success to the successful" element that could be balanced better.

Seems to be a very random game with card drifting mechanism, but I think the strategy is very important. The weak point is that when other players play against you, you have no chance to win.

RATING: 8
A fine game of trick-taking. I have excellent memories of night-long game sessions with endless games (due to the victory conditions of the 1st edition). I was really happy to find it back in a compact version. It includes a fair amount of luck (card drawing) but offers good opportunities to bluff and to negotiate. I wonder what the new rule (of not attacking opponents' provinces as well as the new cards will bring. Still the original game is still playable from the game bits and there are many variants to test. I guess it will become a frequent "gateway game" at my place.

5 plays / 4,5 players ( FFG 3rd ed.)

LIKE: Some bluffing involved, interesting combat system.
DISLIKE: Random deals. Player elimination. The game can get slightly long if playing with conservative players. Some aspects such as the cards running out can screw over the unaware.

OVERALL: I like the game. I wonder if it even works with less players? With 3 players, I'd wonder about how often two players would screw over the third if that player wasn't involved in a war.

Played once but it was a very bad experience. Don't remember what it was exactly but all of us who played that game are now joking about this game everytime we talk about bad games. It may very well be a nice game but in our experience, that game (that was played right) was pretty anti-appealing. I don't expect a complete and perfect experience out of any game that I play only once, but this one was memorable.

The components are very nice. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun and elegant game with plenty of player interaction, thought and conflict - my sort of game. It's short, easy to learn yet full of depth and Strategy and Tactics.  The powers of the different special cards are very well thought out and bring a lot of bluff and head scratching.  It plays well from 3 players up to 6 and is different with diff numbers of players.

Great entertainment and a perfect filler when you have an hour left.  It can drag on longer than that, but not usually.

I have the bigger box edition and the pieces and cards are gorgeous.

Much better than its predecessor Ivanhoe. Have played 6 player and 4 player. Works better with 4 as 6 doesn't offer the opportunity to win multiple areas in one turn. Board may be a bit too sparse in 4 player though as the middle has too many connections. Still unsure of this.

Very luck dependent, how good of a time you have depends on your draw, especially since sometimes you just dont have the cards to support any fancy plays so outplay potential is limited.

Taj Mahal effect, two+ players fight and win as much as the next player who wins easily because the other players spent all their cards already. I like the cards just not the likely effect it has on players trying to win, sort of like an ebay mentality, people get wrapped up in winning this particular auction instead of the long game of getting what they wanted at a good price.

9-01-11 First play, 5 players, and we really enjoyed this a lot. I love all the interactions that the cards have with each other, and the way someone with a smart play can sneak a victory out that you didn't see coming. Not sure I understand the strategy of it very well yet, but I can see this one hitting the table often at our table.

After a couple more plays, I've decided to drop my score from an 8 to a 6.5, because I would rather play several other things. Maybe it's because I've always seemed to have bad cards, but it seems VERY dependent upon the hands dealt to you...

Pure area control game based on cards. Bluffing and stalling are big parts of the game. The artwork is okay. 
It is a bit luck-prone depending on the cards you draw, however, one can mediate it by bluffing in some way.
The game is quick to play and perfect for travelling.

RATING: 6
Very tight card management mechanisms (you do not get too many cards and you cannot change them) combined with highly unbalanced cards and combos leads to game (almost) totally dependent on luck. On the good side, it takes very little space, is relatively fast and takes up to six players.

 Juego sencillo. Se van jugando los territorios italianos. El problema es que hay un momento en el que el juego inicia un bucle del que es muy complicado salir.

Hmmm... I don't remember too much about this game, except that I wish there was some sort of visual icons or text on the cards to indicate what they do. I really don't like remembering or looking up what each card does when I play, especially since language-independent information would be a simple but serious improvement. UPDATE: Final decision is to trade pile this. Success in the battle line is very dependent on cards drawn. The map is very nice and the game is compact in a good way.

I finally had the chance to replay it with my group, after a year, and we had a great time. The key of this game is the various alliance that last for a single battle, maybe less. Condottiere captures with a simple ruleset the intricacies of diplomacy in the Renaissance Italy.

Juego de cartas sencillo y ligero, se dan lugar a comabtes por diferentes regiones de un mapa. Cada combate es una especie de puja en la que se van jugadno cartas de la mano para ser el que más valor logra reunir.

I would probably give it a 4, but having read other comments that might be unfair as I have only played 3-player (a few people say it suffers for this). Negotiation was mentioned as a mechanism to overcome poor cards or a runaway leader, but there was apparently nothing to implement or control this. 
Taken overall it just adds to my growing feeling that I generally dislike 'top that!' style card-cum-board games. Plus the oversized cards are a pain.

Initially I thought that this would be an area control game based on the components and short description. And it is, in a way, but its really card driven and more about hand management then anything. With that being said, the game plays fast and is a lot of fun with players having to be wise in picking their fights and in bluffing one another. Portability of the FFG version is a huge plus as well. Compact player aids are recommended to give new players a reference to look at when needed.

the rich get richer factor is present and greatly exaggerated with two, but it seems better with more players.  2 cards extra per victory is still ugly.  doesn't seem to be enough you can do with a crappy hand since even if you screw around with low numbers and scarecrows they can just stand pat.  10s, drums, bishops, keys are all gigantic cards to draw, scarecrows seem to make good hands more powerful and not help bad ones, winter seems weak without drums.  opportunity for other players to wipe out your hand and theirs too through overaggressive or mistaken play.  rating is beginning to stabilize.  i've become a bit of a sucker for anything that plays 6 players, so i'm bumping on that.  i'd like to try the 3rd edition to see the ffg changes.

A fine little area control game; a bit like Taj Mahal in that you're playing cards in turn to exert control over an area, but the game's goal and scoring is much simpler than Taj. Pretty easy to explain (if you remember to explain all the cards) and quick to play. A good buy.

This is the first game I've ever had a player throw their cards down and storm out of. A bizarre circumstance...

Nagyon nagy pozitívum szerintem, hogy sokkal több a játék fizikailag, mint amit a doboz sejtet, szemben a játékok többségével. Talán itt már a másik végletbe estek a készítők, tábla, bábúk, kockák, rengeteg kártya, és mindez kb. egy kártyának megfelelő kis dobozban.

One of my gaming buddies moved a mattress for me with his truck, so as a 'thank you' I purchased this game for him at a local game store.  Knew nothing about it, but once we played his copy, myself and one or two others in our game group felt compelled to add it to our collections.  Accessible, fun, and addicting, it comes out rather regularly.  Nice filler. [Gift]

[i]Posted: 7/11/10, Rated: 6[/i]

[i]Condottiere[/i] feels like a multiplayer adaptation of [i][thing=9446]Blue Moon[/thing][/i], with a dash of [i][thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing][/i] or I suppose the more appropriately-themed [i][thing=760]Battle Line[/thing][/i] for flavor.  That may sound like a good thing, as [i][thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing][/i] is a "10" in my book: I think the tension added by the inclusion of "proofs" to capture stones is exquisite.  In [i]Condottiere[/i], players are trying to capture provinces in Renaissance-era Italy.  [b]Yawn![/b]  [thing=8045]Haven't[/thing] [thing=555]we[/thing] [thing=46]seen[/thing] [thing=35572]this[/thing] [thing=24762]before?[/thing]  If one player captures any five territories or three adjacent ones then she wins, just like [i][thing=760]Battle Line[/thing][/i].

The struggle for control of a province is conducted by playing cards in a fashion that feels very similar to [i][thing=9446]Blue Moon[/thing][/i]: play one card at a time, and announce your "line strength."  Special power cards allow you to affect the cards in play.  It works well, and leads to unpredictably wild outcomes as you may decide to stop contributing to your line in the belief that you have the province wrapped up, only to see your line gutted and then be unable to fortify it.

If I'm being fair, then [i]Condottiere[/i] was probably an excellent game when it was originally released in 1995.  [i][thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing][/i] was developed in 1999, and [i][thing=9446]Blue Moon[/thing][/i] in 2004.  It's very possible that the [person=2]Good Doctor[/person] was inspired by it.  In today's market, [i]Condottiere[/i] has a difficult time making it to the table over better entries.  If I want a 2p game, then I'll choose [i][thing=372]Schotten-Totten[/thing][/i] or [i][thing=9446]Blue Moon[/thing][/i].  If I want a multiplayer game, then there's always [i][thing=21882]Blue Moon City[/thing][/i].

Despite its uninspiring gameplay, there are two areas where [i]Condottiere[/i] stands out.  First, it scales up to six players, and I suspect that it gets better with more players.  Second, the [geekurl=/boardgameversion/27409]Fantasy Flight Silver Line version[/geekurl] is packed into a very small box.  Compact games are always nice to find.

This game is just flat out fun. Lots of great moves to make, lots of ways to really affect battles. Depending on who you play with it can be just a beer and pretzels game or you can make it quite deep with lots of thought going into how best to sabotage your enemies. Just a really slick game for me, the only reason it loses points is that if you get dealt a truly bad hand or if your opponent(s) get great hands it can seriously affect the game. Despite this randomness the game shines to me, excellent.

I own the Fantasy Flight version and the Euro Games version. I was a little disappointed when I realized that 2 player mode is kinda useless, since it then becomes much more about the luck of the draw and much less about strategy. Probably best with 4-5 players. The Fantasy Flight Version has much more beautiful artwork in my opinion, and additional cards. The Euro Games version box is huge in comparison. I think the 2 games should have 2 different pages, since they are not the same games.

RATING: 10
What a cool game!  It's quite simple with the cards, but there is room for strategy, bluffing, conspiracy, alliances, etc.  Our first game was with six and it was as lively as any game I had played.  Coop play can help, but yet that means people know what you are thinking of doing so a double cross could be in line.  Board placement is important, but even more important is the ability to have more cards and get the area you want.  From reading descriptions of this game, I knew it would be fun, and even then, I was pleasantly surprised on how much fun.

Dec 2015 - bumped to a 9. 2nd edition is a pleasure to play and the gameplay is awesome, especially with six.

June 2017 - a 10.  This is a great 6 player game.

Is this the perfect abstracted strategic wargame campaign? Sometimes I think so. Other times I think it is entirely abstract and the theme just a thin wash splashed over it. Either way the game plays well, engages all players, even for two, and gives a fast satisfying result.

Luck of the draw is significant.  Seems important to know the card distribution.  After 2 plays, it seems like this game has its moments... but it's over too soon, and you cannot count on your opponents to "do the right thing".  Much like the game Attika, someone usually has to "take one for the team".  ** After 2 more plays, I can say that this game is not good for 3 people.  Also, it wouldn't bother me to wait another 4 years to play it again because the game is too random.

RATING: 7
Simple area control game with card based combat. The combat revolves around mercanary cards of different strengths. To modify this there are a number of other cards which modify your own or everyones strength, remove certain played cards from the battle or even allow you to retrieve cards back in to your hand. A pope counter stops a region being fought over and that's about it. No worres to learn, we pretty much just started playing the game and saw the effects of cards as we went along.

Lovely and simple. It really is 'just' a card game, but the board is pretty and adds something important. I was not expecting at all to enjoy this as much as I did. Feels like a push-your-luck game. Have played with 5 and 2. I dont like it so much with 2, it takes the tension out of the game and makes the Bishop seem pretty pointless. Seems like 4  would be best. I'm wanting to play this many more times. 

AFTER playing with 3, it still seems like it would be best in 4.

Un juego de Cartas con un minitablero de la italia del renacimiento, dividida en 17 estados. Se trata de obtener conquistar 5 estados conectados entre sí siguiendo determinado criterio, o 6 estados no siguiendo dicho criterio. La conquista se realiza mediante enfrentamiento por cartas, con reglas bastante sencillas. Tiene cartas de legionarios, (de poderío militar) y otras cartas especiales que simbolizan el poder de la iglesa, las influencias políticas, las estaciones
El juego está bastante bien, aunque el factor suerte tiene más peso del que me suele gustar en un juego.
Lo he probado a cinco, y después de hacerlo mi opinión ha mejorado bastante. Le subo de 6.5->7

Use your cards to win battles and mark territories.  Win a certain number of territories and you win the game.  In order to do so you need to outbluff and outmaneuver your opponents.  Know when to bow out of a battle and save your cards for the next fight.  You won't get new cards until everybody uses all their cards, and that is what makes this game so interesting.  This game is simple to learn but requires some strategy.

Love this game!  Quick to set up and play, always a challenge!

I like the tension in this game, the choices you have to make about how you play your hand.  The tension involved with deciding whether you are going to commit to a battle or not.  It's a great game.

I own the Second Edition and the Third Edition.

Notes on the differences:

The Second Edition is far superior in terms of art and production, the large board, art style of the board and cards (all art is by the game designer) are an absolute delight.  The cards are large and somewhat unweildy, yet despite this minor drawback, are also imbued with a different personality that is really set off by the wonderful card art.  Aesthetically, I really like the Second Edition.

The Third Edition art is excellent, but typical of fantasy/realistic historical game art of thelast few years.  The art is good, but doesn't really hold a candle next to the Second Edition.  The Third Edition is, however, much more portable.  I am looking forward to playing with some of the new rules, such as those for the Bishop, the Coutesans and the Spring cards.  I will comment on play differences once I have played this edition.

Have played with the 3rd Ed.  The 3rd. FFG edition is far inferior to the 2nd and 1st ed. The added cards dilute the hands and tactics available.  The choices that remian are poorer than in the original editions.  If you go to buy this game skip the 3rd ed and do your best to find a 1st or 2nd ed. 3rd ed adds much that takes away from the brilliance of the game.  The original is wonderful, but the 3rd ed is very poor indeed.

My Ratings:

Second Edition - 9
Third Edition - 6

I own the Fantasy Flight third edition of the game. It is very quick game which tries to mix a bidding system with some kind of very slim wargame. Rules can be a little confusing at first, due to some offects of the special cards that interact one with another. There is a bit of strategy involved with the gameplay, yet luck plays a VERY major role and this tends to ruin a lot of games. If you are dealt with bad cards you've got few chances of turning the tide...
Very superfluos in 2007. Very GOOD packaging for the third edition, slim box and nice cards. Hope more publishers will adopt this philosophy of "big game in a very small box": my shelves really appreciate.

The luck of the card draw makes a BIG difference in this game, but it's still pretty fun. I absolutely love the Bishop and Surrender cards, which curtail the normal ending conditions of a battle. Knowing that those mega-cards are out there completely shapes your strategy, in a good way. And playing them at just the right moment (e.g., when the other players have exhausted their high cards in a war of attrition) is a beautiful moment. We have started playing with more and more table talk and diplomacy, which only improve the game.

Didn&#039;t do anything for me. Like any of these multi-player &quot;take over the world&quot; type games, it seems like the other players can always whack you down from a victory run, so it&#039;s more of a game about timing and sneaking into the win, which didn&#039;t really excite me.

RATING: 6
Not sure about this one; it's fun but feels very 'brittle': if any player screws up they can easily allow another player to run away with the game in the first round, and there's nothing the other players can do about it. The drummer is also ridiculous, basically an auto-win card.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game of hand management.  Once everyone knows the cards and what they're capable of, it's a great, tense game of bluffing and tactics.  Great for a semi-quick filler!  

Note:  My rating is for the original edition.  In my opinion, the new FF release really flubbed the great balance between all the cards with some changes/additions to the card functions.  I'd give the FF version a 5.

[7/11/2007]I'm not sure the game actually works.The card play as such is intriguing. But I'm worried about those bidding in a battle getting past a point-of-no-return where they just have to soldier on and spend all their cards. In that case, much comes down to the card draw luck of those involved in such a battle. Sure, clever play of the special cards may improve your odds, but the card draw plays a huge role if several players power out their hand.The trouble seems that you don't have a good idea what your odds in battle are. So much is dependent on the decision of the other players whether to contest the battle or not. And whether the turn will only feature very few battles or not.Those not involved in such a death-match can gleefully lean back and then collude in the effort of deal ing out a couple of very cheaply gained provinces. Of course, those contesting the first battle(s) in a turn don't want that to happen. But then we're coming back to the issue regarding the point-of-no-return in battles.My feeling is that the winner-takes-all mechanic might be the underlying problem, but there would be other ways how to adress the issues I suspect the game has.I think there's a very compelling game in there. And after one play I'm not sure whether it's a broken design or not. I've merely played one game. It was great fun! I just got that uneasy feeling the game might ultimately not work for the reasons I mentioned above.This is why the rating (6) for this game is very much up in the air. Could easily go up to 8 (it's fun!) or delve right down into the rating cellar (if it's broken). I'm eager to find out what my final conclusion will be.Taj Mahal - using a related system - has several independent objectives in each battle and features a nice balance between getting out early of a "battle" and forcing a swift decision. Apart from the surrender cards, Condottiere doesn't really allow a player to force an early decision. It's all about deterrence and persuading the enemy to forsake the battle. But that's quite a blunt instrument, since the loser will have invested so much contesting the battle he might just power on. Sure, there are the scare-crow cards, but I doubt they really fundamentally undermine the described death-spiral. They just postpone the point-of-no-return.

A nice game of getting the best army to influence various battles around Italy. Aim to make a row of your own pieces or connected pieces or get the most pieces on first. You can be dealt a very duff hand at times in this game though that just shuts you out of it and affects you later in the game which I don't like more and more. 4 Plays.

Recently this has been my favorite. Great tactics, bluffing, and enjoyment for groups--especially 4+ people. A little trash talking spices things up. Don't blow all your cards in one battle! But don't let another player get too far ahead! There's a Diplomacy-like deal-making/back-stabbing rule, but we've never used it.

RATING: 8
A clever bidding game masquerading as a game about war. The game uses dollar auctions effectively by controlling when you can refill your hand. Due to the way the area control mechanic is implemented, the game marches continuously forwards to endgame.

However, it can happen sometimes that a winner is decided by very poor play once the round only has two players left. This is unenjoyable for all.

I can tell this game is from a while back.  Why?  It is a perfect example of the "I got the best cards so I win" type game exemplified in early Euro card games.  It seems the mechanics are not quite developed to the standards of todays popular card games.  There are added mechanics intended to make gameplay important, but they really fail.  I guess I have only played the FFG version.  But I have heard the changes from the Eurogames version, and I am still not impressed.

RATING: 4.5
This game is fairly simple and lacks depth (but it actually does take a while to explain the rules simply because of the fact that there are a lot of different cards all with special abilities - not a good sign). Granted, I only played it with 3 which is probably a less than ideal number, and I’m therefore looking forward to try it with 4 or 5 (which I’m going to in two weeks, so I will eventually update my comments). The main reason it fell flat with three is because it kind of sucks to pass as there are only two other players left; with 5, it would be much more feasible to pass and let the other players fight over the region. 

It feels a little poker-ish in the sense that you have to know when to fold and when to push through – and when to bluff and play in a way that the other players will pass (i.e. playing a lot of low cards and then seing the others drop out because they fear you have a winter card etc). But just be careful, because if your bluff doesn’t work, you’re going to have a bad time indeed as you don’t redraw until only one player has cards left…!

What I do like about the game is the negotiation; “don’t place the condottiere over there because then player X will be able to get 4 provinces in a row and win the game” or “I can’t do much, you’ll have to play cards in order to avoid player X from winning”. 

What I didn’t like was the simplicity of the rules which are in contrast with the number of special abilities and rules of the cards. Also the game is tedious at the lower player count. The luck of the draw also seems significant; some cards truly are a lot better than others, and you might get lucky and draw a lot of those (a Heroine is always good).

Fun, short card-based conquest game.  The artwork on the cards is great and the Renaissance theme is really conveyed by the artwork.  The game is very much like Iliad, another good card-based conquest game, but this one is perhaps a bit simpler in its card battle mechanics.  However, having an actual map w/ locations to be conquered adds a strategic element not seen in Iliad.  Overall, a good game -- especially if you don't have a lot of time to play.  Probably best w/ 3-4 players.  Great companion game to Iliad, as the games share very similar mechanics overall.

After one play, I give this a somewhat uncharitable 4. The cardplay seems chaotic and unbalanced with the non-mercenary cards changing the game too dramatically for effective hand management to be possible. The boardplay seems somewhat meaningless. The bidding does add an element of tension that, while not strategic, could be construed as fun. Overall, very light fare. I'd play it again, but only because it is short and I have the nagging suspicion I might have missed something the first time. I'll never suggest it, though.

This is a 9 with 2nd edition rules and a 6 (if that) with 3rd edition. Newer, in this case, is definitely not better. As to my comment on 2nd edition, see the recipe below.

Step 1.
Take 250gramms of Lost cities, 200 grammes of Ca$h and Gun$, add 50g of No Thanks and 100ml of Diplomacy. Mix thoroughly and leave to rise.

Step 2.
Cream together 5 parts Poker, 2 parts dudes-on-a-map (Risk is fine here), 1 part snakes and ladders, 3 parts Metropolys and 9 parts awesome artwork. (at a pinch you could use 3rd edition ingredients but the flavour will be inferior)

Line a second edition rules tin with the rolled out mixture from step one and fill with the mixture from step 2.
Grate a generous amount of strategy, tactics, bluff and lying over the top and bake in a hot oven until the inside is melted and gooey and the outside is crisp and awesome.

Garnish with a some freshly picked schadenfreude and serve to people who know how to have a good time.

Trust me on the 2nd version rules though.

This game was a lot better than I expected. The maneuvering on the map to get 3 linked territories actually added a very important element to the game. It made each hand a lot more strategic.

Its a well-produced trick-taking game with an added spatial element to put pressure on players to need to go after, or block other players from certain hands. 

It also plays quite quickly, which is a big plus. I would be willing to play if someone in the group was interested, but I wouldn't request it.

Clever poker/bluff style card game where you need to make the best use of the cards in your hand. I enjoy it but it was a flop with my non-gamer mates (probably due to its complexity) and keeps going down in rating the more I play, mainly due to downtime and taking too long with more players, esp if they're not concentrating. Feels more like a filler but plays longer.

Acquired July 2008.  Traded August 2008.

Picked this game up looking to play a group game with my local gaming friends.  Very disappointed with playing it as a group game.

The problems with playing it as a group game is that there is too much down time.  Once a player passes, they must wait until the entire battle finishes.  This causes a lot of side conversations and activity that drags the game out.  Think this game would be pretty good with a smaller player number, like 3 or 4, but playing it with more wasn't much fun.

Additionally, the game is very hard to recover if you are not dealt a very good hand. I've have limited experience here, so I would have to give it a few more tries. 

Traded away for Mission Red Planet.

Played older version on Vassal.  Very strategic, thought provoking game.  It almost reminds me of an abstract, but I do like the theme very much. I do consider this to be essentially a card-driven wargame comparable to Iliade, but unlike that game, there seems to be less of a feeling of futility at times. The game also encourages short term alliance and negotiations, and offers the abilty to help other players win regions when it is to your advantage. Very sharp little game. I have only played with three players and it was a very good experience. Update 1/08: I now own the 3rd ed. by Fantasy Flight. New card types seem to add to the game well but do not overshadow the classic core mechanics

Can be a bit random if you get a poor hand, but the objective is to correctly play the cards you get. Important to take a district before the replenishment of cards, two if you can swing it. The heroine may be overpowered, but there aren't too many of her. Easy to learn, fun to play.

A bit on the simple side, but if you use some of the variants, it can be a pretty fun game.  Really though, it's just about playing higher point cards than your opponent (which comes down to luck of the deal), or bluffing with low cards (and hoping they don't play a "surrender" card to end that battle).  Still, it makes for a fun filler game.

Just bought the FFG version (10/6/2007) - will check it out soon!
First game (11/10/2007) - two player game with my wife. It's a big hit! More fun than Battleline because there are more choices to make. The game also has a bit more flavor as the mapboard gives it some wargame feel. A nice feature of the FFG version is its small size. The two of us could play it on the couch with room to spare!

I've played this game about four times but only once all the way through. People really seem to have a tough time grasping the hand management concept here and then get frustrated with it, but I like it and need to play more. The trouble point for a lot people is playing too many cards early, or holding onto them too long and then being frustrated in not being able to play them. I think that's a great balancing mechanism. I've heard there are some alternate rules that might make things easier (such as with the 2-player variant and redrawing some cards after every round), but that makes it more just like any other game.

My only problem with this game was the rule about drawing more cards for areas you had won. This gave those in the lead a huge advantage.  Any advise on this would be welcome as I do like the premise.

Players represent warlords, trying to conquer chunks of medieval Italy.  A multi-player card game sees players take turns playing cards one per turn to form up armies, announcing their total strength.  The alternative is to pass (pull out of the battle).  When one player is left standing, the highest total wins the battle and places a cube on the territory fought over.  Get four adjacent cubes, or any six cubes, on the board to win.  Okay card "combo" game where you get to bluff, and play a few clever combos.

This game is just brilliant. Quick to play, quick to learn, original gameplay, and serious appeal to gamers.

Update: I played the new version and I didn't like it as much as the original. The original design is obviously superior. Also the extensive gameplay changes make the game less tense and tactical, and a bit too random and unpredictable. I think the new version has all the important components to be played with the old rules though (just remove a couple of cards and use the old rules).

FFG had this stride where they put out three little box games all starting with "C" that are very, very good games (Citadels, Colossal Arena and this one). And this one is the one often overlooked (hell, at this point though these are all so old they're becoming forgotten to time). I wish there were words on some of the more obscure cards though. It would make the game much more accessible instead of passing around the rule book so people can look up what their hand of cards do. That said though, once players know what the cards do and how to use them the game really shines. I was looking to trade but after my most recent played it has solidified itself as a keeper.

Interesting game, although the strategy is fairly difficult to wrap your head around at first. Nice components and artwork, although I find the oblong cards frustratingly difficult to shuffle. This will never be one of my favorites since it's just not really my cup o' tea, but I think it's worthy of play from time to time. Not so great with only two players. 

The old EuroGames version is essentially broken for 2 players since one player can always end the round at any time by simply continuing to play cards so as to run out of cards. This makes the game nothing more than a contest of pure luck- whoever draws the best cards will play them and run out their hand, one battle per round, round after round. I had a peek at the new Fantasy Flight rules, and we've attempted to fix this deficiency by introducing a rule that states that if you intentionally end a round by plaing more than one card in a row after your opponent passes, your opponent can choose to keep any one or two cards in his hand during the reshuffle and draw phase.

This has some good bluff card play. And as always i like the historical theme. Its a bit too random to be serious though. 

Played again recently as I now have the Euros games Edition. This game is awesome with 3, my old ranking (6) was based playing with 5 and it can be a bit slow and chaotic with that number. At 3 this is a short tight game of bluff with beautiful components and a solid rapping of theme.

Probably prefer having no spring card (a new card for the FFG version).

Condottiere is an interesting game. Condottiere can be played fast. It's basically a card game with a board. It's rather light, some bluffing, repetitive. Non-gamers could play this and enjoy it. 

Condottiere feels like a filler board game, though the last time I played Condottiere it took forever that 2 players had to leave so the game ended in a tie. A normal shouldn't take that long.

Winner is the first player who is able to connect 4 regions together. Most cards has numbers on them. There are a couple of specials cards which can affect a game round. The special cards are interesting and adds a nice twist to the game. Having a crappy hand can cost you big. So the luck of the draw is a factor in this game. How you manage your hand is very important. It lacks something to be played more.

Two things intrest me in this game.  First our group plays a lot of lighter games, but they tend to be themeless, so for a light card game this injects a little more theme for me into the gameplay.

Second, I'm not normally a big fan of trick taking, but I've been intrigued with merging trick taking with a boardgame and this is such a design.  I'd like to come across something that is a little heavier, but this will work well with my group.

As for the gameplay, I'm not blown away, but there are moments of manuevering with your hand that can be interesting.  It's fun to lay traps for people and have them waste cards, or bluff your way into an easy victory for a territory.  I'm not ready to go higher on the rating yet because something about it still feels undercooked about the design.  I don't know what it is though.

Ah, I've found it works better with more players.  Three players has problems when one person steps out of the bidding quickly and bides there time, while the others duke it out.  There is also less information being presented in the game due to fewer cards being played.

A classic!  Very accessible card-based strategy game.  In the interests of play balance, we instituted the following house rule: players only get 1 extra card (not 2) for each territory they control.  Otherwise, players who take territories in the first round have a far too overwhelming of an advantage.

This is an interesting light filler card game.  The mini-board that comes with it is pretty adorable.  This game feels somewhat similar to Great Wall of China but with more types of cards.  This could be worse since you can have a hand of more useless cards with this one than Great Wall.  I'll have to play both a bit more to see what I prefer.  Don't play it 2 player because it's very dull and the game is better with the more players you have.

Good, quick simple-to-play card game, with some good choices of both strategy and tactics.  Winning the provinces (battle rounds) is important, but sometimes it's more worthwhile to negotiate with your opponent(s) and save cards for later turns.  Great theme and I was impressed by the interesting application of theme into the game and take-that, even though some battles seemed to progress over many seasons(!)  I think though that fits the historicity of the era, with long sieges, etc.  It's not the deepest of games, but a quick one that's quite portable and I really enjoyed this.  And there's hand luck, but it's a 45m card game and you can afford to lose a coupe of battles, but still win the war.  More players will probably increase enjoyment levels at a detriment to game speed.  Probably 3 or 4 is best.  It's a cheap game with loads on eBay, so go try it out now!

RATING: 7
I'm always partial to Renaissance-themed area-control games. Nice push-your-luck element in fighting the battles. 

The aim of the FFG version seems to be to make the game shorter and to remove as much as possible the arbitrary diplomacy element from the game. Can't say that I disagree with this goal to make it a better game. The changes may have made the game more sensitive to luck of the draw, e.g., a player having a Winter/Heroine combo on his last province to win the game. But as the game is now shorter, I can cut some slack on this.

RATING: 4
[2 plays] This game is certainly not without its layer of strategy, but it has one quality that I really dislike: it's one of those games where you’re always either banding together to stop the person who’s about to win, or also trying to manipulate each other into doing the stopping.  I prefer games where my time and energy is spent trying to win, not trying to prevent others from winning.  

The cards are hard to shuffle. They’re extra long, which can make them a little awkward, and they’re actually long enough that they’re hard for people with smaller hands to get a grip on for shuffling.  They could’ve made them just a little smaller for about the same look, but more ease of use.

Hand management in a neat little package. But the deck is too large and varied to deduce what's in your opponents hand. Getting a crap draw is very possible and feels very hopeless. The game might be too random, or maybe the bluffing and negotiation aspect are just too large a part of a system that don't quite support the randomness. Still lends itself to some exciting moments, but I don't know if there are a lot of clever decisions to be made here.

There's too much of a disconnect between the amount of planning and randomness here for me. I don't like that I spend a considerable amount of time planning only to have my plans undone anyway due to me not knowing who has what cards. Ostensibly, that's the fun here but I don't like either holding back when I should've gone for a victory because nobody could've stopped me or going for the victory and being stomped only to see someone else then win because I'm unable to stop them simply because I didn't know. Also, I still maintain that the Key cards are essential to draw if you're going to win.

this game has the hallmark of a classic, but is undone by a unbalanced mix of cards. The designer fixed this in another game, Iliad which is similar, but lacks the boardgame aspect.

Condottiere was revamped thru FFG this year (2007), this version seems to have been fixed by the addition of some new cards and a toned-down effect of some others, sadly, for me at least the gameplay is still lacking no matter how many people play.

In contrast, Iliade is still a more engaging version of this system.

This is SUCH a great game! The rules so simple but the card play and strategy is amazing. I&#039;ve played the game maybe 5 times now and it impresses me more each time I play it. It has real aspect of poker combined with a geography element that poker and other card games lack. I just love this game, it&#039;s a classic in my humble opinion.

1x 4-player game

Used to be a very good game. Unfortunately it did not pass the test of years. A bit to long, a bit unbalanced, a bit rpetitive. Not bad mind you, just outdated. It nevertheless remains one the prettiest games I own.

RATING: 7
A really fun time killer, Condottiere is one of the few card games that I really enjoy through and through.  It helps that its very brief and encourages a lot of competition and deception, and the included mini-board is a nice touch, that helps draw in people like myself that are more into the board game scene.  The artwork on the cards is also phenomenal.  The game can be played with two players, but really shines with more players.  If you need a filler game, this might be it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played 1 time with 3 players. Very simple, very fun game that plays better with more players. Sort of Taj Mahal light. The only problem with this game is that it is so simple, I'd rather just make my own copy, and customize the cards to include a few more actions. Great game, but needs a small map and a $12 price point to be attractive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
In some respects I guess this is just another little card war game, but I enjoyed it.

* Theme is nicely carried out:  Fighting factions in Renaissance Italy deal with mercenaries, spring and summer, political influence, troop morale, battle tactics, growing armies, and the Pope's interference.
* Beautiful cards, easily understood with no text. Simple rules & other nice components by Fantasy Flight. 
* Simple & strategic.
* Travel sized box same as Red November.  Here the board is not a problem even if a full 6 are playing.
* 110 cards, but maximum 84 used in a round & then reshuffled, so lots of variety and combinations.
* Luck can be strong with the draw of the cards but this can be countered by manipulating the length of the round to draw new cards.
* Short. The box says 45 mins, but with 2 players, less than half an hour.
* Many variations suggested, which extend the play time of the game, but also the re-playability.

I have played only 2-player games, and liked it.  However, 3 or more greatly changes the game because alliances (non-binding) are allowed and players can even show their cards to another.

Some push your luck, hand management, bluff, and round length management.  It's fairly accessible, but offers no easy decisions.  It also scales quite well to 6.

Quem olha para a caixa pensa que é um cardgame. Talvez seja mas é o que melhor disfarça. É um Small Box com cartas, peças e tabuleiro, tudo pequeno. O tamanho não impressiona mas o jogo é bem interessante. Cada jogador deve ocupar, com as peças, um determinado número de territórios mas para tal deve vencer uma batalha em que se utiliza vários tipos de pessoas (cartas) que podem ser guerreiros, heróis, cortesãs, espantalhos e outros mais. Cada um com força e habilidades diferentes. Bem legal. Com dois jogadores é muito tranqüilo mas o jogo permite até 6 pessoas o que deve deixá-lo bem caótico. Bom jogo. Um mini board game com disputa de área. Gostei do jogo.

A great card game with a touch of area control on a map of Italy. Very thematic when you read up on how the Condottieri used to fight their battles for the city states of Italy. Or rather not fight their battles - lots of military posturing, indirect fighting and 'military science' to decide the outcome.

The game scales well for all player numbers and the special cards add a surprising amount of variety and tactics. The finite hand size (until all other players need to draw) adds a touch of (light) strategy to the game, in addition to the tactical card play when engaging in battles. For 2P, I tend to use the variant which allows both players to draw 3 after a battle to add a bit more tension.

All in a nice, little portable box. Highly recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's basically a card game and is subject to luck of the draw... But once you get hold of this one, you can play a couple of rounds in a reasonable time-frame to even-out the luck factor. Also, unless you really get a crappy hand, you can usually figure out a good way to use your cards. The gameplay can look too simple after reading the rules, but there are a couple of neat twists you should discover on your first play. The production value is great, the cards just look marvelous.

Condottiere feels like a slightly thinkier version of Knizia's Ivanhoe. The special cards aren't quite as powerful but luck certainly still plays a big role. The small board is basically just a way to add an alternate winning condition, and therefore labelling the game "area control" - while technically true - places far too much emphasis on it.

A fun, lightweight, quick game of conquering Italy.  I like that in order to win, a player must choose the right provinces in which to fight (and keep track of how they effect their opponents), choose the right time to back out of a fight, and finally conduct their fights well.  The only problem is that anyone who gets a bad hand is totally hosed and whoever gets a good hand is very likely to win.  Still, with a play time of around 20 minutes, theres no reason that one can't play multiple games to help balance the odds.

With 3 players, play "The King is Dead" instead.

Incredible how such a simple game get so much player interaction, strategy, bluffing (poker!), and lots of laughs and backstabbing.  Definitely a gem in my book.

UPDATE:  Rating dropped a bit after playing with a group of female gamers.  The fact that many had to sit out during most drawn out battles bored most of them, and while it is still not a bad game, there are definitely better crowd pleasers.

I like to think of it as an improved version of Knizia's Ivanhoe.

The battle for control of the board by claiming contiguous regoins and the battling of troops represented on the cards almost seems like two separate mini-games. However, these two things work brilliantly together. I suppose that's what war is about, the broad strategy for aread-of-control mixed with the tactics of close fighting. It also plays nice and fast, unlike many war games.

In one of my game groups this is a big hit, often requested.  The game moves all over the board.  When it looks like one player is going to win, the winds of favor shift and someone else snatches victory.  In the other game group they just can't seem to "get it", the game has ended for these knuckle heads with the 3rd or 4th battle every time. Go figure ??

Bought as part of a bulk deal in April 2014. Printed a player aid from BGG which helped a lot with new (and new-ish) players.

Can play a bit long, but usually just right. Hand management is less important with only 3 players, so I'd say it's better with more.

--

I got it into my head that this game can run a bit long so it got left on the shelf for a while. Now it's reached that awkward point where I can't remember the rules clearly enough to teach it spontaneously, so other games just keep getting picked. If I was being harsh this could be trimmed from my collection, except it's such a small box and I do remember it as a good game.

I really like the way this game plays. Condottiere requires enough thought and tactics to satisfy strategy buffs but is easy enough to grasp that it won't put off those who enjoy a light game. My one complaint: I think there are too many bishop cards. A bishop card came up in nearly every hand, which pretty much nullifies those high-value mercenary cards. If you don't have the high-powered special card, your hand can quickly be ruined by the playing of a bishop. At the same time, I essentially won a game by using the bishop to wreck my opponents' final hand. A fun game. We enjoyed it a lot.

An absolute blast to play with 3  players. My friends and I always play with the play cards face-down variant as I believe it adds greatly to the depth of the game and introduces a high amount of bluffing (which I love). The game doesn't take long to play and is full of conflict and area control, simply a must have for any competitive gamer. This game also had the best packaging I've ever seen, no space is wasted and for an area control game with a board and wooden bits, you'd never think that it could fit into such a small box.

RATING: 6
The problematic end-of-round conditions ruined most playings for me. They went something like this:

All but two players are out of cards. One (player A) has a full hand, the other (player B) has a very modest hand. To my mind, the "proper" move in this situation is for B to contest against A very strongly. He'll probably lose but by expending his entire hand, the damage will be limited (the round ends and A has gained a single territory). But what usually happens is that B imagines he can let A win a battle or two (or three!) until *his* hand is strongest, at which point he'll win a battle or two. Of course, what actually happens is that A wins two or three battles (and blows his hand on the final triumph) and B is left with nothing. And since there's a built-in rich-get-richer mechanism, A romps to victory in the subsequent round.

It's very difficult to recognize that, even though your hand looks pretty good, it may be best to spend it all in a losing cause in order to end the round.

Since the core of the game is so very good, I spent much time trying to figure out how to alleviate the above problem -- I never could.

A bit of a disappointment really. A fun enough card game in its own right but seems to lack that something special. Doesn`t scale down very good, needs at least five people to play it properly.

Update 2016: Recently dug this one out during a game night and discovered that it actually held up pretty well with six players. My recommendation would be to play Condottiere only when you have six players, but skip it otherwise. Still, rating upgraded to 7.

The cards are kind of dumb--draw lots of tens (heroines especially) and drummers and you'll do well. That, and the way cards enter the game is kinda dumb. That, and the territory selection is also dumb and kingmaking. 
There are much better games of chicken available--Beowulf is my favourite, but I'd take most of them over this strangeness.

Fun little multiplayer game that ties negotiation and diplomacy style elements to a simple trick taking/card auction/bluffing battle mechanic.  The special characters keep things interesting.  Lots of replayability because there is lots of interaction.  Some luck in card draw BUT diplomacy aspects can mitigate that.  A nice little game that is easy, cheap and portable.  It has lots of depth considering how short and easy to teach it is.  Immediately after the first play, I wanted to play it again.

The basic idea of this card game is great. I can see an opportunity of warm up game in this. It has great strategy options and guessing what the opponents might have. I quite like it, but the fact the rules help the strongest just pisses me off. We tried it with the opposite method if you get one city you get one less card but it still didn't work well.

Pros / Cons:
-The basic idea is great.
-Great warm up game, which can be competitive for the last cities and win.

-It has big luckfacktor that you can't overcome, for example when you get just low value soldiers.
-Bad rules help the strongest.

A quick-playing area control game, with an interesting card play mechanic. Basically, all cards played are lost, excepting mercenaries retrieved using a scarecrow card before end of the round. So all bids are paid, whether or not they are won, which leads to some interesting card play.  7 on a first play solo/4-hand.

This proves better with a full complement of six players- raising to a 7.25.

This seems to be like the card game of War, where players play cards with various ranks, in order to win a 'battle' in a selected province in Italy. The game mechanics are simple, but the gameplay itself is confusing for newbies. Players are trying to get three contiguous provinces, sort of like 'Hollywood Squares', but not necessarily in a row like tic-tac-toe. There are a number of special cards that dramatically alter the value of cards played, such that there is tension during battles. Players must use tactics similar to Bridge, drawing out 'trump' (i.e. the high cards, the special cards), trying to establish your hand with length, as well as strength. With six players, this is very difficult. The first game was chaotic, with play being sporadic and random, since we didn't understand the significance of the special cards. Once we understood them, the gameplay improved dramatically in the second game. There was a lot of tension, and 'oohs' and 'aahs' as various players competed with each other trying to outfight each other, only to be disrupted by a special card. The theme is tacked on, but seems to work. Not a bad filler game. Rating: '7'.

RATING: 8
"Is it better to be loved or feared?" 

Surprisingly deep when you factor in all of the possible player interaction (shifting alliances, etc.) with the boat-loads of strategic and tactical options.

This is not a card game—it is a game of negotiation, alliances, and backstabbing.  If you play by yourself, for yourself, you're missing half of what should be going on here.  Dealt a bad hand?  Two people pulling ahead?  Form an alliance for protection.  Make it 2 v 4.  Hand whole cities over to each other... or get your "ally" to overextend so you can cut him off at the knees.  The card-battle mechanism is very much a sideshow to a vibrant and boisterous game of bluff, counter-bluff, rope-a-dope and intrigue.  It's [i]Diplomacy[/i] lite with an extra helping of whipped cream.

(The Descartes Editeur version with the gorgeous, tarot-sized cards and the wooden condottiere piece.)

Someone told me that this game is broken because if two people work together that one of them has a greatly increased chance of winning the game.

Effectively an auction game, themed around how many mercenaries you're prepared to sacrifice to win control of a territory.

The 1st and 2nd editions are a solid 8: fun, light card game with some bluffing and a bit of negotiation. The FFG version (a company who never fail to disappoint) breaks the good features with needless extra cards and annoying rule changes. They also got rid of the lovely large woodcuts of Landsknechts for some boring and generic smaller cards. It is cheaper though, and the gameplay changes are luckily easily reversed.

First played August 27th, 2007.  Being taught by an expert will take about 15 minutes, however it's worth it and the game itself will only take 20-35 minutes to play (for 4 of us anyway).  It seems to have a bit more luck in it than I usually like, however it played pretty well and we haven't firmly grasped the strategies.  We had loads of fun with it and will surly play it again soon.  It plays up to 6 people as well.  Essentially you assemble an army each round to take territories.  If you get 5, you win.  If you get 3 in a row you win.  Winning a territory requires cards, bluffing, strategy and a bit of luck.  Figuring out when to play cards and when not to is the key her I think.  I'd recommend giving this a game play and consideration in playing in your rotation of games.  I'm told it's pretty cheap by standards and is worth owning.

Very nice albeit unforgiving area control game utilizing an auction like mechanic of playing cards (and bluffing) to hold the largest army.  Needing to control three adjacent territories means you need to hold cards in reserve, so you have to pick your battles when deciding to cut your losses.  Very fast play.  Can have down time for some players.  Very effective screw your opponent mechanic comes into play as well.  Excellent game.

At its heart Condottiere is a bidding game. I think it is miscategorized as a wargame.  The components are quite good and the artwork conveys the renaissance feeling of the game fairly well. The game can be quite tense as players try to bluff and force other players to bid more than needed to obtain territories, or otherwise mislead players as to their own territorial goals. Management of your hand, efficient bidding and good timing in the use of the various special cards is important.

This is essentially a card game with relatively simple rules (the board adds only one additional element to the game) and as such works very well. There is a significant element of chance and no scope for long-term strategy, but at a tactical level it can be great fun. I had played only the first edition until a recent game of the third edition. The rules and changes make a difference to the game, though I'm not yet sure which version I prefer.

Best card based combat I've ever played. The old Eurogames version I accquired certainly seems deeper and much more tactical a game. It`s certainly much less forgiving of mistakes and the combat is less predictable. To my shame I also seem to be much worse at this than at the FFG version.

Neat simple little Auction/AC game, very TAJ like which always sits well with me, basically a spot on map gets picked to be auctioned off, you make a bid or pass, once you pass your out.  Whoever wins, puts a cube on board, you win with 4 adjacent spots or 6 total.  

So like TAJ, you need to pick your wars carefully, and then go big when needed, and make half fast plays in other areas and see what shakes out. Some neat special power cards here, that when timed properly give nice options, there were a couple I wondered about but most were good. Deck might actually be too big, and maybe the number range was too big which when combined seemed to make a fair size luck factor, its only a 30 minute game though so likely still in line with time frame I think but I seen one hand where one guy had all crap and another had quite good hand, probably shouldn’t happen too often.  Likely Best with 4, not very good 2, 3 okay, 5 or 6 no good too crowded and chaotic.

Good game, especially with six players - gave lots of breaking points where different players could win.  Not good for two players.  Now own the 3rd Edition, which is different, but not worse.  You need to use some of the variant rules though - bigger kingdoms for one.

I don't like the card mechanics in this game, everything else is good.  I like how over exerting in one area can make you too weak to take another, and how hand size increases with more territory.  The way battles are played out, however, just strips all the joy out of this game for me.

Went in expecting multiplayer Battle Line and was, as a result, disappointed. More of a bidding game with area control added. Seems like result is a bit too dependent on drawing a good hand, meaning one with a lot of high value cards. I would usually rather play something else that doesn't have that issue. For example: For Sale, because the first round starts with equal resources, or 6 Nimmt!, because the value of cards is so contextual that there's no definitive best hand.

It took me over a year to notice we have played wrong a critical rule. It changes the game from a pile of junk to a tactical jewel :S. It is a good game indeed.
 
It plays more or less in a quick fashion and you have lots of chances to screw with the leader which is always fun (except when you are the leader of course). If you like light card games this is one I recommend you to try.

Also I learned that ALWAYS to read the rules and not trust the player who constantly wins the game with their private set of rules :P.

It’s been years since I last played Condottiere. My desire to play the game again is rather low so I’m downgrading its rating to reflect this fact.

Condottiere can be a good card game, but these days I crave heavier experiences. I could play again if requested, but I won´t seek more plays of the game.

This card game is of a genre I don't care for much - "battle" card games where several players play cards in a set to gain some objective.  Emphasis is often on when to bow out without taking a devastating loss.  Games of this ilk I've played are Iliade, Big Manitou, and the card portion of Taj Mahal.  Truthfully I don't care for any of them, so I have to accept that this isn't the type of game for me, and go from there.  I'm not sure where this game ranks alongside the others mentioned - my feeling says about as good as Iliade and Big Manitou.  There's not much to screw up, to be honest.

Scales well for different numbers of players. Card game with nice mechanics masquerading as a board game. Stalemate situations can develop, especially with larger numbers of players.

The tweaked rules make the game more playable, but I'm not sure they make it better than a "bad" game.  When playing the original game with 6 players, we got caught in a never ending cycle of leader-bashing that meant that the game would never end.  The tweaks seem to indicate that this would not happen with the same regularity, but I still think that the game would be too long to remain enjoyable.

Decent little game.  This is a basic card game where you play your best cards to try to acquire provinces.  Not overly crazy about the run out of cards out of the round mechanic, but seems to work for this game.  The game is really based on luck of the draw which some people may not like, but doesn't bother me in this one.

**UPDATE**

Disregard my last two sentences above, playing your hand to the best of your ability and intentionally running yourself out of cards is a viable strategy.  Good game.

The box says it can play two, which is a lie, the game does not exist with two. With 3 it is okay but a little odd, and with 4 or 5 it is fantastic! You must be very tactical in the card play, read your opponents well, anticipate special cards, manage your hand, and know when to strike.  There is a fair amount of luck in the cards, and there is an unfortunate system of the rich get richer...

Anyone can play--even mom & dad--& can learn it very quickly without a long mind-numbing lecture of the rules.  I love this game & will take it on every trip I go on & entice anyone into playing it!

I find it surprising that this game has seen so many new editions and still is played widely. It's not outstanding as a card game and doesn't shine as an area control game as well. The combination of both doesn't add up to more. I rather play a clever card game or a pure area control game. In Condottiere, a particularly good or bad card hand can throw the game for players, not to speak of the kingmaking potential. At least it didn't take too long.

It's taken a few initial games to figure out the subtleties, but this game has really grown on me. Simple rules and only a handful of special cards make the game quickly accessible. Bluffing and screwage is high. Table-talk and bash-the-leader is encouraged. Hand management and opponent manipulation is key. I don't feel like I'm playing the system as much as I'm playing against the guy across the table, and that is awesome! I haven't been this enthralled with a "light" game since I discovered Coloretto a couple of years back.

A nice mixture of clever card interaction and area control, and easy to learn. Plays from 2-6, but I think the 2 player game might be a little too cutthroat.
I love with the small form factor, although I wish they kept the pieces from the old edition (I think everyone's tired of pawns and wooden cubes). The board doesn't stay quite flat either, but since it's not where the game really takes place, I can overlook that.

Very fun card game with simple rules that lasts about an hour. Board is mainly used for keeping track of the score and where the present battle is, although a victory does occur if a player controls 4 cities which geographically lay next to each other. However that's the only strategic element the board employs.

Even though a bad hand can really cripple a player for a round and have lasting effects, there's still a fair amount of bluffing that can occur, and the rules do allow for players to make deals and pacts (but they cannot trade cards).

Only played with 3 players so far (yes a kingmaker effect can occur), but can't wait to play again! Especially with some variant rules I got cooking in my skull. :D

Seems like it could be a somewhat interesting auction game where you want to avoid getting drawn into wasteful bidding wars but also avoid having unspent cards at the end of a round.

Why is this game so popular? I don't get it.

I won the game I played by pulling ahead early - probably due to good cards - and then just passing immediately in every round until only two people had a few left. I then won a couple of counters simply by having skipped my turns and waited ten excruciating minutes while everyone else took theirs. 

What happens if everyone does this? 

What a ridiculous way to win a board game.

[PNP] This game is a quick and fun card game with very strategic choices. Sometimes you feel luck is not with you on your draw but you know that if you play cleverly you still can get a region or force others to waste cards. Since there are different rulesets I just play with a mix of both which makes the most sense to me. I also find this game teaches hand management very well and before I introduce people to Cosmic Encounter I sometimes use this game even though they have major differences. The game is out of print but making a print and play is not that hard. I Recommend it for sure.

Simple "Whoever has the highest total in front of them takes the city" game. You can play cards that let you put already-played cards back in your hand, to keep them for the next battle. Special cards change the value of other cards, like Winter, which makes all regular cards worth 1 point only. When you win a battle you win a city on the board, and to win the game you need 3 or 4 cities next to each other. This might look difficult but in reality it is extremely easy. We house-rule 1 extra card per city each round, instead of 2, otherwise whoever is in the lead just becomes impossible to beat. Better with more players, but remains a simple game.

A beautiful game that doesn't work well for 2 (and 90% of the time, the game sessions are just with my wife), and drags a bit with 3 or more. I feel like it deserves another chance, but there are too many other games I'd rather play instead.

Condottiere is one of the first games in my collection and got played a lot in the late 90's. It is a good card game, but the game can last too long and might require a player to sacrifice his/her chances for victory to avoid that another player wins.

This game has absolutely beautiful artwork on the cards, and the rather strange mechanic of cardplay will appeal to some, even as some are turned off, I suspect. Still, I enjoyed it quite a bit, and expect I will want to play again whenever there are real gamers looking for a filler.

New edition gets a 6.  Too small, and the loss of the beautiful tarot-style (and sized) cards costs this game a lot of the charm and tactile pleasure of the original.

My comments & rating apply to the 2nd edition; I don't like any of the changes in the 3rd edition rules (the one published by FFG).

A favorite.  Simple rules, only a few types of cards to understand, but they work together in interesting ways.  I like that it's possible to win even when you have a bad hand of cards.  (But of course some hands just can't be saved.)  Also, few things are more satisfying than winning when everyone else at the table is trying to stop you.

2009-10-31: I should probably drop my rating, as this hasn't been played in a while--for a while we didn't have the numbers, and then one of the guys had played this [i]a lot[/i] and preferred to try other stuff--but I'm not going to.

Easy to play but **beware** the rules from the newest edition were changed from the previous edition.  Specifically the 'new' Spring card and the usage of scarecrows is very different between the older and the newer version.  The gameplay is significantly effected by this--the older version is much more cutthroat while the newer one is kinder and someone else can't ruin your army as easily.

Latest play...6 people, was more enjoyable and tense than past plays.

It's an OK game but it not that much exciting. You mostly conflict for some territories by playing cards and trying to have the highest hand.

Some special cards allow you to perform special effect that could screw the out come of the battle.

Very simple game, not so bad, but personally not enough. There is missing twist to the game to make it more interesting.

LIKES:

* There is some nifty card play decisions in this game and some excellent interactions among the cards that really becomes clear as you play the game.  For example, the scarecrow card seemed only good at first at picking cards back up to save for a later battle, but if you have a decent amount of both bishop and scarecrow cards, you can really devastate your opponents by forcing them to discard the highest value mercenary.  
* Fantasy Flight version is quite compact in a tiny box and works very well!  Makes me chuckle a bit that this originally came in a large box!
* Sometimes, you must work together with your opponents or even give an opponent a victory to live to fight another day.  

DISLIKE:

* Player aide cards for the different cards and their powers would have been nice.  If I end up picking up a copy, I will definitely make some!
* While I think it balances out over the course of a game - at least with three players, the luck of the draw can be frustrating but I think there are some clever things that you can do with card combos.  Just depends if you have the time to do what you need to do or if someone ends it with a key card before that can happen.
* I'm not sure I would enjoy this game with more than 3.  Three feels like the perfect number.

Ez az a játék, amit valahogy sosincs igazán kedvem elkezdeni, viszont ha már játszok vele, akkor kivétel nélkül mindig nagyon élvezem, jobban, mint a többi játékot. Azt szeretem benne leginkább, hogy lehetőséget ad blöffölni és folyamatosan más-más taktikával küzdeni a tartományokért. Igaz, két játékos esetén általában terítjük a lapokat, de több játékosnál bejön a képbe az is, hogy hagyhatom a többieket egymással harcolni, és amikor legyengültek, akkor sorra elfoglalni minden tartományt előlük. És mindezt nehéz megvalósítani, mert ha meg már túl gyengék, akkor újraosztás következik, azaz új lapokat kapnak és megerősödnek. Szóval nehéz az egyensúlyt megtalálni, de annyi biztos, hogy minden egyes játékot nagyon szoktam élvezni!

A really great bluffing/hand management game. It does a lot of stuff, and it does them relatively well, but it does none of them exceptionally well. That being said Condottiere gives you a lot of bang for your buck. The game is essentially a card driven multi player battle system with some special cards thrown in. The game will punish the fool-hearty, and reward risk takers. Simple enough to learn in about ten minutes, but deep enough to provide you with many hours of gaming fun.

Interesting card/board game with bluffing and hand management aspects.  Although it can seem like a card game with a board that's really just an elaborate victory track, the determination of which areas to compete for and which areas to abandon is the key to strategic play.

Renaissance Italy plus cards, beautiful maps, tokens and a superficial history backdrops.  It is a nice party game with cards like poker. He who can get out the largest number of mercenaries (read "points" on the cards) can win the battle and control the region.  Controlling three adjacent regions/ provinces can win the game.  A number of hands is played out therefore in attempt to control the provinces.  You develop your strategy based on the cards you are delivered.  Adding in the special cards like drum doubling your mercenaries; winter blowing mercenaries away and thus each card is counted as one point only; scarecrow to bring back your better mercenaries (higher points card) to your hand; bishop to callfor an end to the battle at any point in time; and some mercenaries who stay at the same strength being immune to the special cards.  Yes, there is some strategy in your hand management but the gametends to favormore the one who can have a lead in the beginning of the game.  2 more cards are given to the player hands per controlled region, thus allowing more flexibility to the hand with more cards.  The winner also has the choice to pick up the next province to battle.  This adds a little bit flavor to the game's strategy as to determine when and where to best strike with your hands. Cards are shuffled every time all players pass. Remaining cards on hand would be discarded and therefore wasted.

This keeps hitting the table and getting the 'let's play again!' verdict.  So many board game I have (and most of us addicts buy) get played once or twice and then gather dust, but I see the opposite with Condottiere.  I picked up the new FF version at Gencon '07 and  the packaging, components, size of the board and the clarity of the rules (along with the excellent artwork) make this great for travel.  Has just enough depth so it doesn't get boring while being light enough to bust out on a whim. Highly recommended.

Nice little conquest card game. The hand your delt is important but it is more important to choose the battle you want to fight. Has some similitude with Knizia Camelot/Ivanohe.

12/2009 Briefly tested my FFG version. Although assebled in a more elegant and managable package, the previously played EuroGames version felt slightly more strategic.  The added FFG cards, Spring and Courtesan, dilutes the deck adding a larger element of luck into the cards your dealt.  Rating down 8 -> 7.

This comment is about the original Eurogames version, not the FFG version.  Very easy to teach, very portable game.  The card combat is fun and surprising, with opportunities to laugh and enjoy the plot twists of the card battle.  The mechanics are solid.  Unfortunately there is a bit of "spectator downtime" given that many battles end up as a one to one duel while the other players are relegated to the spectator role, but then again you if you are competitive you will be paying very close attention to the duels to figure out what others have and don't and how they play.  I would like to play it more to get a better sense of the depth of play and test strategic alliances and betrayals.

With one play of the new FFG edition under my belt, I'd say that this is very good, but not different enough from Iliad to make me want to own both of them. The most obvious difference - only winning counts, placing second is not worth anything at all - is something which I'm not sure I like, so for now I'd prefer Iliad. I'll have to have another go at Condottiere, though, since I'm pretty sure this is not a game you'll fully grasp the first time round.

I like the way the card 'battles' play out, the special cards really change things up and keep it lively.  But I don't like the way you claim areas on the board--I guess we played a vanilla version in which already claimed territories can't be fought over.  It felt like if you got a good spot early on, you were in the running, and if you didn't, you were just playing kingmaker--do I want to blow my cards keeping that guy from winning, or keeping that other guy from winning?

An auction game that is simple and fun. Various special cards add some fun twist to the game, as well as some thematic feel.

Luck of draw can influence the play, but hands are distributed many times so the luck is lessened. Moreover, the game is short enough to enjoy.

I prefer original artwork which has flavor of medieval europe.

By far one of my favorite games in Fantasy Flight's "Silver Line" series.

The base gameplay is simple, the actions are simple, but the strategy is bountiful! This is a fantastic game that includes table talk, maneuvering (placing the bishop & condotterie pawns), countering, bluffing and strategic timing.

Every time I have played this game people have had a blast. It takes a few rounds to get used to what the special cards are and what they can do, but once you do...oh boy look out! 

The components are excellent with gorgeous artwork.

It gets better the more people who play it and I think the max is six people.  Its only flaw it that it's not awesome with two or three people.  You definitely need at least four.

I was pleasantly surprised by Condottiere. The mechanics are simple, but they have quite a bit of depth. The table dynamics, and the many nested decisions made around playing the players, the current situation, and planning ahead are delightful.

RATING: 9
Rating based on 3 players.

Early rating, but I found this tremendously fun. Hand management is key: not only deciding what resources you will play, but when to play them (timing is extremely important). When do you go all in? When do you call your opponents' bluff? Yes, your hands can be swingy based on what you're dealt, but making the most of what you've got is part of the fun.

RATING: 8
Very good impression on everyone on the first try of this game. Lite on rules, difficult choices, and has very good amount of drama. Just based on feeling during game (and Not mechanic-wise) I dare to call it Cosmic-Encounter-Lite.

RATING: 5
Too luck-based for my taste (can definitely have rounds where your cards give you nothing to work with), but it had some fun mechanisms/moments. Maybe a variant to allow re-drawing cards would move it up a notch or two.

RATING: 8
Nice game where you make the best of the cards you're dealt and pitch the other players against each other. Not for control freaks, perhaps, because of the luck of the draw.

RATING: 6
A small box card-driven area control game set in Renaissance Italy.
Nice bit of bluffing now and then, let down by contests being more often won by whoever drew the best cards than by whoever played more cleverly.
Can be fun nonetheless.

RATING: 7
Even non-gamers I know like this game.  The components are good quality and it plays quickly.  There's real strategy for a gamer.  What irks me is that Fantasy Flight changes games when they republish them and design them so that you can't play earlier editions.  This edition of this game is that way.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Don't trust the overall rating here on BGG.  
Condottiere is a great game!
Everyone I have shown it to really likes it. 
It is basically a card game where bluff and guile will serve you well. If you are at all a fan of poker, you will love this game too. 
There is a lot of strategy involved and you find a tension that is quite delightful when deciding to play just one more card or pass. 
Make sure you play by the second edition rule set. 
Give it a try. 
I guarantee you won't be disappointed.

Played a four-player game, thrice, and a three-player game five times. All using the third edition. Shades of Iliade and Ivanhoe with a board. Nice artwork. I look forward to playing it again. Though I think the Heroine card is over-powered, as it has no counter-card. So sometimes it seems the game boils down to who is dealt the most Heroine cards, as her 10 points can not be stymied.

Never can get enough of it. Opposed to many, I like the FFG rules more, but similarly to Stratego it's a highly customizable game and with house rules everyone can get the game he wants out of it. Works pretty well with 2-3-4 players. Kids from 6 can play it quite well, however it requires some 'birds and bees' type debriefing regarding the Courtesan cards.

A surprisingly smart and very fun game in a small box.  It's essentially a card-based wargame that non-wargamers will enjoy.  The card play is quite simple, and one could overlook the underlying strategies if you take things at face value, but there is quite a cool game here.  I think it's highly under-rated.  Lots of player interaction and amusing deviousness.  This will be a favorite.

Fun, compact game that seems to play fast. There's a lot of strategy and tactics involved and I feel I didn't scratch the surface. I hope to play again soon.

The more I play this the more I like it. It's a mean, frustrating game, but good nonetheless. 

Update: Why this is listed as 2 players is beyond me. Do not get this if that's all you have in mind.

Decent enough for what it is, with some interesting strategy. The theme is of course oh so light, but it's not a bad game.

If you enjoy card games, this is probably a nice twist that you'll enjoy.

RATING: 8
The more I play it the more I like it.  It offers a huge metagame and requires both logical and psychological analysis.  The bishop and the key make this game.  Without these two cards, the entire game would unravel.  However, as these two cards were designed into the game it is brilliant and has tons of subtle nuance.  The game unfolds a story.  Great stuff here.  This is the single best multi-player card game I've seen.

The good parts are the tactical choices of when to fight, when to pull back, and bluffing your opponents.  The bad part is that much of what you can do each round is determined by the hand you are dealt.  There is not much you can do to improve a bad hand through clever play.

Light filler with some (limited, mostly luck-related) tactics and no theme. This was probably a very good filler 10 years ago, but there is much better available today.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's a card game that involves bluff and timing.  Battles are chosen and the main stategy seems to be to try to diminish your opponents hand while keeping enough good cards for yourself to win other territories later.  I have observed that everytime this is played at least one person really despises it.  Will try again but afraid my rating will not improve.

FFG small box Silver Line edition, well produced, good reissue of this game.

Played it once 3P. I think that this would be best with more players (4 or more) so that there is a higher probability of people missing battles because they are out of mercenary cards. Even though I've only played it with 3, I really am excited to get to play it with more once I get the chance to.

UPDATE:  Upped to a 6 from a 5 with the 3rd Edition.  For some reason this version is a lot more tense and wargamey.  Want to play with 4 and then with some of the optional rules.  Rating may rise.----------------------------------------------------------

I'm not sure I get it.  This is a game MADE for me.  It should easily have been an 8.  But we played one hand with five people, and the experienced player won in the end of that one hand.  The rest of us were *extremely* nonplussed to say the least; on further examination, there didn't seem to be anything any of us could have done, not without having a detailed knowledge of the game beforehand.  There must be something we're missing.  Or is there?

Played once, with 2 players. Not very balanced. One of the players can easily get a 2 or 3 region lead if he gets better cards initially. Probably much better with more players.

Too much kingmaking going on, added to the fact that you can't do much with your starting hand if it sucks. It's also extremely chaotic as if you fight for something, you can only beg your opponent not to overextend or you both risk giving up too many cards. Not uninteresting, but there's too little control.

Plays well with 2 but really becomes fun with 4. The rules can be a little confusing (e.g. When a round ends compared to when a battle ends - not necessarily the same thing.

Play cards out of hand to win bid for cities. Cards are values or special cards. Highest total wins city, and first person to connect 4 cities wins. Game when the drums came out people started making drumming noises or singing "Little Drummer Boy". Now, the mechanics of playing cards and battling for cities is fun. However, the game itself in trying to connect cities potentially leads to long games and stalemates, thus the second edition tweaks the rules so that only 3 adjacent cities leads to a win. Still, it seems the game overstays its welcome everytime we play.

Tactical game with a little luck in how you draw the cards, but I like it a lot. Spend as many cards as you want in this battle, but it forces you to go easy the next time or you will run out of cards. Being able to take back a card you already played in a battle, using the Scarecrow. Double the value of all your Mercenaries with a Drummer etc. etc. The only down side is the small board, which makes placing the cubes a little fiddly.

I agree with the summary that this is more a card game than board game, but still great fun.  I think there should be some adjustment to the rule whereby someone with a province gets more cards than others at the start of each new deal . . . why give those that are ahead an advantage?  Particularly, when that advantage can be captured in the first round with a lucky hand.

Condottiere requires some incredibly cagey play, even if you get dealt a decent hand of cards. The fact that no one can gain any new cards until all players have none left in hand can doom a person dealt a bad hand to a game where they have no chance of winning. Not that anyone else knows that. Bluff your ass off! They don't know you don't have a field leveling Winter card, or the battle nullifying Bishop! You may not win, but their victories won't come easy either. Troll the crap out of everyone!

I like the era accurate pre-renaissance woodcut-style art on the 1st Edition cards better than the art in any later release.

Zu fünft oder sechst kann sich Condottiere durchaus unsympathisch in die Länge ziehen und stellt dazu Neulinge mit manchen Sonderregeln oft vor Schwierigkeiten.

Bei weniger Mitspielern ist dies jedoch ein großartiger multiplayer-Fechtkampf mit Täuschungen, Tücken, Mutproben; lustigen Geschichten und glänzenden Siegern.

Finally got to play this one in a couple of 2 player match ups.  Pieces are excellent for portability - small pieces, small sturdy board, big readable cards, all packed in an almost pocket sized box.

The game has a lot of potential.  I do not recommend it as a 2 player game, but I think 4 or 5 players would make for engaging play.  Here's why.  The 2 player version is too influenced by card draws.  There is also no reason to play more than 1 battle per hand.  What makes it still a 7 for me is the intriguing combinations I was able to play in my limited experience.  I could see some really cool battles happening with a few more players.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I know this is not a want to play all the time game because there are other multiplayer games I'd rather play given the same time.  Their themes and mechanics appeal to me more.
-> Currently, there are several other 2 player games I'd suggest
+ It is a good game and I would willingly play if someone else suggested it - I really want to try this with more people.

You have a hand of cards that are either attack cards, or something that modifies the attack. It seems that you really have to use your whole hand to take an area. Just make the best arrangement or two of cards and hope that you can win an area with it. Sometimes it's good to just bow out early if you think another player is going to go strong into a region, that way you don't waste cards.

RATING: 6.85
Branding this as "A game of Rennaisance intrigue and battles" implies having a lot of imagination :p

It's a card abstract game that involves a lot of bluffing and a minimal area control aspect and some negotiation, if you play with the right players.

The game feels a bit long, but the gameplay advances very fast, there are no dead times. The rules are very smart, they allow a lot of options and plenty of bluff. Of course, there's the luck of the draw too.

The rules are very simple, it's a game apt for everybody, as long as the player count is 4+.

The rule that allows you to take one card more per territory you control has been critized for its snowball effect, but I like it, since it promotes offensive playing styles, more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First impression (4 players): Condottiere is about choosing right battles to fight. You have 10 cards with numbers or special powers and you should try to make most of them. Problem is that players get new cards only after there is only one player with cards. Ideally you want to play to areas others aren't interested or when they have weaker cards in hand. You'd like to save your good cards for a good spot but then you might have no chance to play them at all before getting new ones.

Winning "battles" is straightforward, one with the highest sum of numbers wins. Problem is that special cards can force players to discard highest card(s) / nullify all numbers to ones / end battle early. You cannot plan too much ahead and some cards simply are a lot better than others so luck plays quite a big role in the end. I liked the basic mechanic as it is pretty clever but amount of chaos is a bit too much. 

Oh yes, the icons on cards could be clearer. You do learn them in one game and if you play regularly this isn't really a problem but in the first game I actually would have preferred to have text also reminding what special cards do.

Semplice da spiegare e da apprendere ma non per questo banale. Le partite sono certamente condizionate dalla fortuna con la distribuzione delle carte, ma il tenore del gioco è appunto quello di un filler divertente. Durata media di 30' minuti ma ho assistito anche a partite lunghe il doppio. Esistono diverse versioni: i materiali delle prime sono più curati sia nelle carte che nel tabellone, ma anche troppo ingombranti. L'ultima versione invece ha un formato pocket decisamente più comodo da trasportare ma forse meno pratico da giocare. Anche i poteri delle carte sono un po' differenti tra le varie versioni. Gioco che per la sua semplicità si lascia giocare spesso e volentieri.

It's okay but, I found remembering all the powers of all the special cards difficult for the first couple of games, I'm beginning to get used to it though.

I find Condottierre a little too long for what it is; if it took 20-30 minutes it would be a lot better, but it is closer to a 1 hour game.

The newer edition is better because it is shorter.

Though there are some decisions to be made, it seems to boil down to if you have a bad hand you have a bad turn, if you have a good hand, you have a good turn. It just seems like one big luckfest.

The fun here is the escalating tension of watching people getting sucked into a war, knowing that the losers are getting smacked out of contention for not just the rest of this round, but possibly the game. (Winners get more cards than losers next round, perpetuating the cycle.) The downside is being on the losing end. There's some meta-gaming ganging up that can happen to even things up, but that just evens things up and makes an unattractive game longer.

This game deserves a reskinning with The Games of Thrones.

Very Cool Quick Hand Management Area Control Card Game ! Light-Medium Filler Game. Negotiation is encouraged. This 1995 game which was ahead of it's time. Has an occasional luck-of-the-deal problem. I'm not saying this game is for everyone, but I think this is an excellent game for what it is and does. Okay with 2-players; Better with more than 3 or more. Easy to learn and teach. 

Portable Game! Casual Game! Beer-N-Pretzels Game! Not a Gateway Game, IMO. As Joel Eddy says, it's an "Ameri-trash Filler".

Oh how I wish I could play this more with groups.

I cannot compare this to The Iliad. I like them both and think they're both different enough.

Really like this one. Beautiful components & art. I replaced the Condotierre token with a D&D Mini for better effect.

I retrograded my FFG copy by removing all the Courtesans and 3 Bishops and took out the Pope.  If a Bishop is played, immediate cessation of the battle, no winner and Condotierre token goes to the left of the person who placed it last.  

10+ games in and I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface on this one.  I haven't learned how to use the "show your cards to another player", or "make deals" aspects yet.

2/12 - Update- Bluffing is a fun, key element here. I had a remaining hand of 7, 2 Merc cards and the rest were scarecrows, drums, and bishops. I kept the leader playing his heavy cards before I scarecrow my best one and then ending the hand with a Bishop.

I like the original game better. Fewer cards, fewer rules and less chaos. Now it's not drastically different, but the new FFG changes are generally for the worse. Not sure why they bothered to fuck with the design.

It's a nice filler with a take that design. I do worry the rich get richer, but who the hell knows? I'd like to try this with 4-6 players.

So: throw away: 
- 1 scarecrow card
- 3 bishop cards
- 3 spring cards
- 7 courtesan cards

Download the rules for 2nd edition and viola, you have the old game again. The only other thing you need is 4 more tokens per color. Not really sure that's an issue as you can just use tokens from the other player colors when playing with 2 or 3 and with 4+, you're unlikely to need more than 6 anyway.

Very quick and nice game. However getting good cards is very luck dependend, and thus can result in odd hands - I got 6 purple cards, 1 red, 2 mercanaries (values 1 and 3) and a spring in one round... I never got into competition for the first place afterwards.

Taktikai, területfoglalós kártyajáték, megfelelő emberekkel játszva nagyon vicces tud lenni. Szabályok kicsit bonyolultnak tűnnek az elején, de könnyen bele lehet rázódni. Minél többen játsszák, annál jobb. Az osztásnál kell egy kis szerencse, hogy megfelelő lapokat kapj, de azokat jól ki is kell tudni játszani, hogy meg tudd nyerni a kört. 
Hátrányának tartom, hogy aki az elején elhúz, annak sokkal nagyobb esélye van a győzelemre, mivel egyre több kártyát kap fordulónként.

This is a nice combination of a trick taking card game with a small scale area control game. Each player will value any given hand or battle differently.

Unless all players are equally experienced, hand management causes an unbalance. I am tempted to deal a new hand after every battle, but then it would feel too much like poker or other card game.

Totally based on luck: your draw and opponent's draws. The area is conquered if you have the strongest army there. Only one area at time.

Some cards are just too powerful compared to the others. I just got lucky and got a lot of those red 10 cards. And even though the cards are pretty, I won't consider this a meaningful gaming experience.

Don't ever try this with 2-3, it's not a game then. 4-5 could be ok.

Very much like Ivanhoe (or a much lighter, much more chaotic version of Taj Mahal).  Has some clever card play, but so much investment in each turn is pretty obnoxious seeing as things can have the tables completely turned in a heartbeat, even if you know what to expect.

The rating is for five or six players, where the effect of uneven hands are smoothed out and more people pass early to play more rounds with their remaining cards.
Maybe slightly lower with four

I've played Condottiere a good number of times now and it's always been enjoyable.  I like the cardplay and threat mechanism, and the strategic choice of provincial takeover is an appreciated extra layer.

Condottiere is fairly easy to play and would be a good game to introduce to fans of 'crazy eights' or 'thirty one'.  The game presents an opportunity for bluffing, negotiation, dominance, and strategy that ought to delight any fans of both card games and fantasy.

Really wanted the Eurogames version, so I bought one.  Subtle differences in the rules will make for quite a bit of change in how the game is played round to round.

Bigger cards, bigger map, bigger player pieces, nicer Condottiere piece, and just 'bigger' overall when compared to the FFG version.

Although I haven't actually played this version yet, I imagine the play will be much different.  Notably, there is no "spring" card to counter the "winter" card.  Bishops end the battle with no winner, enabling an easy way to dispatch your opponents Heroines without letting them win the battle, no courtesans means only the winner will decide where the next battle will take place, and there is no bishop token so the next battle can be fought anywhere.  I really like these changes in concept.

RATING: 5
Similar gameplay as in Attacke and Alles Im Eimer, but suffers initially from a deck of diverse card effects to take into consideration otherwise all your oneupmanship can be dramatically reduced, sure it's fun but not when you're at the receiving end of your well thought out plan. There are some problems I have with Condottiere when compared to similar designs:1) flexibility of choice makes for slow rounds, whereby in Attacke etc you have to follow colour or fold; 2)when you're out of cards early, be prepared to sit out for some time 3) tabled values can vary dramatically, and so there is continual re-evaluation, reducing pace. My complaints are levelled at a 6 player session, the game maybe better with at least 4, but I'd rather play AiE etc for similar emotional outcomes in a shorter timeframe. Rating may improve with less than 6 players.

Mini-Risk with cards.  (Or a card game with some board strategy).  Fun, a lot of player interaction (very much on the Risk order).  The second edition made significant improvements to the rules; streamlining play and shortening the game. The third edition physically compacts the game and the new cards breath a bit of life into the game. The third edition balances out some of the earlier cards. Simple to learn, yet more strategy than in most card games.

Condottiere is an area control game. While it plays upto 6, games with 6 can last quite a while - 75 mins or so and are too long for what the game offers. Games with 4 are much better paced.

The fact that hands are not refreshed after every battle adds a delicious tension of not giving away territories that you don't care about too cheaply balanced against prioritizing which battles to fight - literally.

A card game that pretends to be an area control game. The board does not add a whole lot to the game but I suppose it is slightly more interesting than just adding up some scores on a sheet or moving a cube up a point scale. The game is good and more tactical than it would seem at first glance. I still think that some of the cards are overpowered and can win the game too soon and too easily and that can be frustrating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Solid card game that just happens to use a board.  The components are beautiful if somewhat unwieldy.  Players need to keep a sharp eye on what provinces to go for and which their opponents are going for.  This makes for a fun bit of strategic analysis in such a simple game.  I absolutely love the new FFG version!

March 2012: Downgrade from 8 to 6.

There's just way too much passing.

Bonus point for the Fantasy Flight edition's tiny box.

March 2011: Auction game with a lot of luck.

A lot of coercion involved, which to me is a very good thing. One tactic is to choose a territory in which to have a battle that another player really needs. Then you try to get someone else to fight that battle, and waste their valuable cards. Of course, this introduces a huge potential of inadvertent kingmaking, but I find this incredibly amusing!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This game can be fun to play as long as everyone is out to win, however if friends/couples play there is a very good chance for King Making to take place.  To this point this can be a very good game or a very bad game.

Solid short Game.  Played the new FFG publishing. This is the game that I wanted Illiad to be.  There is some good chances for cutthroat play, but you can still make pretty good progress despite what your opponents inflict on you and your resources, and you are at less risk of over-committing your resources into a turn that nets you no reward.  It's easier to see the ebbs of the game develop.

The combat is quite interesting with the different special powers and you are constantly fearing that your opponent might have the right cards to stop your plans. Of course you have a hard time if the cards dealed are constantly of the wrong type. But even than you can delay your efforts to a later combat when the others have depleted their hand in order to improve your chances.

I have only ever played this once, and it was with two players, which I understand isn't regarded as a particularly good player count for this game. But I can't see it being improved a great deal with more - all that happened in the 2p game was that you played some cards, while hoping your opponent doesn't have a particular card which screws you. They did. Oh well. Rinse, repeat...

We have since sold this game, because we simply weren't going to play it again.

I love this game: it's fun and quick to learn and play. The more the merrier: preferably 4 or 5. 

Everyone I introduce to Condottiere seems to like this one: guys, girls, gamers, non-gamers etc... It's like poker on steroids meets connect four (or three) just you have to win the battle before you can place your piece.

When we are not in the mood for a two hour plus game of whatever we usually pull this one out with 3-5 players.

thoughts: mech is nice but mb needs bigger game with variable board and regions of differing values ala taj mahal

also if 1pl has 2regions at start of round and connecting region comes up - someone has to stop them BUT noone else may want that region so whoever stops them hurts themselves

really like the idea but doubt the implementation

This game reminded me of Iliad.  A war-themed hand-management card game with just enough extra components to force a decision if you want to fight a battle or sit one out to save power for later.  Of the two, I think prefer Iliad, but this was enjoyable. 

I just noticed that this and Iliad are from the same designer, so that helps explain why the games felt similar to me.

A card driven, war themed Tic-Tac-Toe. The dollar auction nature of the wars is interesting, and combined with some clever special power cards allows for some interesting decisions. The card game itself would actually be a little dull without the board, and it seems fairly easy to have a hand that has no chance of winning any of the regions that round. Knowing when to cut bait is a difficult decision, but only if you have some interest in the board position or a good enough hand to put up a fight. This game can easily get to a position where one or more people can't possibly win, but are stuck playing with no other goal that to play kingmaker.

Really enjoy the card play - sort of Maria/Friedrich-lite or heavier trick-taking game.  However, the board game element of area control does not work well, as it can leave players with little chance of winning but ample opportunity to throw the game/kingmake.  It can be difficult to stop the leader - there needs to be more ways to interact with each other's hand, like forcing discards, allowing you to draw more cards mid-battle, etc.  Also the game can vary a lot in length from 15 minutes to over an hour.  I am working on a boardless variant that I think will address these issues.

I'm glad they reprinted this. During the game players play several rounds with cards they are dealt. It's basically bidding where everybody loses their cards.

I got drawn to this game because of the box art on the FFG edition...

Luckily, the game is fun. The rules are built on two basic skills: hand management and bluffing. Players all get dealt an equal starting hand (in number of cards, not in their types) and they used it in a series of 'battles' to conquer provinces in Renaissance Italy. The map on the (small) game board is thus used as a scoring track. However, conquering a certain number (depending on player count) of provinces adjacent to each other can also bring victory. So there's a spatial element to the scoring track too.

The 'battles' consist of players going clockwise and either choosing to play a card into their active battleline, or pass. Passing means they're out of this struggle, but they keep their cards for future use. Battles go on untill every player has passed, then the one with the highest valued line gains control of the province. Many of the cards also have special abilities, either augmenting a player's own battle line, removing cards from his enemies' battle lines, or providing bonuses and penalties to all cards played in this battle. 

Player's hands don't get replenished untill all-but-one of them has got no cards left. Then each player gets to draw as many cards as he started with plus bonus cards for each of the provinces he owns. The player who had cards left, can keep some of them. This means that you have to carefully weigh your decision to play another card or to pass, as playing too many cards might mean you do gain the current province, but are out of the battles for a few others because you lack the soldiers to fight for you. Both the bluffing and hand management revolve around this idea.

N.B.: An added bonus is the beautiful artwork that [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameartist/12019/tomasz-jedruszek]Tomasz Jedruszek[/url] - one of my favourite board game illustrators - did on the FFG edition of this game. It is very atmospheric and beautiful to look at.

After some more plays I can see that it's a game more about tactics and bluff than about a pure luck. Of course those hero cards are very powerful and in some cases it's very hard (if not impossible) for someone other to win a territory, but it's a game like this. Emotional, not so deep and more important, fun to play. Great game for trips. Easy to learn. Awarding experience players still giving chance for new-comers.

Years ago, this would have been listed as one of my favorite games.  It's a solid hand management game with a bit of take that.  The game can drag on a bit and become samey, and with as many plays as I've had with this one, it's a bit mechanical at this point.  Still, there's nostalgia with this one, so it stays in the collection.

This quick little card game has many fun aspects. I found, however, that it is too easy for players to gang up and shut out others completely. I like the card play, but the aspect of the board makes this a "gang up on the leader" game.

RATING: 7
In Condottiere players are trying to win control over areas of Italy by committing militia into a fight.  Players have a handful of cards which they play as they bid for control of an area of Italy, as determined by a marker on the map.  The winner of the contested area usually gains control of the marker for the next fight.  Among the various types of cards in play some merely add a numerical value, some wrest control of the marker for the next fight away from the champion, some invoke the Pope thereby removing the highest valued militia from play and marking an area off limits, some alter the value of militia, some allow a player to put a militia back into their hand, and some immediately end the conflict.  Players each get an opportunity to play cards or pass, but once they pass they cannot play again for that area.  Once everyone has passed the conflict is resolved, meaning the last person to pass has an opportunity to play lots of cards.  The caveat: you do not get new cards until only one or no players have cards left!

Not all the cards in the deck will be played, because when new cards are dealt the deck is shuffled again, so counting cards will not help.  This adds to the tension in the game because no one is certain what the other players have.  People can start strong committing high-number militia only to have the Pope remove them, or they take them back into their hand again.  Players have to carefully consider how many cards they are willing to play, and which ones, and decide when to allow their opponent(s) to win an area.

Minimum of 5 players! Better with six! An underrated game. Great fun. Bluffing, teaming up, strategy, making the best of the cards you get. Play rewards patience and timing. So long as you play with at least five players, and give the game a chance, you'll realise that it's not so much the cards you get, but how you use them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Easy to teach and learn, even easier to play, but with a lot of difficult decisions, bluffing and tension.  Players are Condotierres in Italy struggling for power in the provinces mostly with valued cards.  But, some of the cards have special abilities, and the game strategy is based on play them wisely.  Besides, the new third edition is so cheap that becomes a must in everybody's collection.  A minor complaint:  the board doesn't seem to get totally plain, but the other components are OK, nevertheless they aren't outstanding.

A comparaison between second and third edition:  The second edition has better and more elegant art and components than the third edition, except card backs that are horrible.  It presents Tarot kind of thin and large cards.  The Pope card has a better and more strategic use in the second edition, however the lack of spring cards is a flaw.  The rules about moving the Condotierre token are easier and more elegant in the second edition.

Which is better:  Form me, a technical draw.  In general, second edition has better card effects and it is more elegant, but the lack of spring cards is unregretable, which are the best addition of the third edition.

RATING: 6.5
Fun but a very flawed game.

The cards are fairly unbalanced as some are simply overpowered while others seem to have little purpose. Also, since you basically get a whole new hand each round, there's no reason to be tactful with your choices in play - you pretty much can always play all your cards. As such, cards aren't that valuable a resource, adding chaos to the proceedings. The battle system has limited interaction - you can't really affect other players too much, thus rendering you impotent when you have a poor hand. Indeed, luck of the draw plays a huge role in the outcome of battles. Besides the randomness, my greatest qualm is the king-making aspect of the rules - players in the lead get *more* cards than those straggling behind! Really? One would think it should be the opposite. I understand this requires those losing to band together, but as I said before - sometimes luck of the draw keep the stragglers from having any hope at all - and when leaders gets more cards, chances are in their favor.

All that being said, this issue is mitigated (somewhat) with more players - such as 5 or 6 - as it evens out the playing field and makes runaway leaders more difficult to happen. With 2, it is a rather irritating affair and not worth your time, with 3 it is simply okay, and with 4 it only begins to entertain.

But there is light at the end of tunnel! The designer of the game improved upon it with [b]Illiad[/b] - which is essentially the same game but with a more balanced deck and improved battle mechanics. I highly recommend potential buyers seek out that over this.

Felt a little Great Wall of China/Taj Mahal-y to me, but without the Knizia design skill applied. 

Lots of luck with the card draws. Lots. 

And I don't like that you can kinda force your opponents to take the brunt of stopping someone by dropping out early in the turn order--hurting your opponents and helping you. 

And I'm not thrilled with how much ganging up there is, leading to someone sneaking in a win by virtue of being picked on slightly less. 

And the tiebreaker is an insane "duel" that's completely dependent on who draws the better cards for the duel. Wha?!

Great game for 6 players.  The rules are learned quickly, and the game plays quickly as well.  Yes, there is luck, bu there are many different options for strategy and revision of strategy during the game.  Our group plays with the variant that each captured city only generates 1 additional card, not 2.

RATING: 6
Lots of good card interaction, but the "surrender" card seems unbalanced.  Also, there's a big trade off whether you will try to stop someone else from winning or take the selfish route and let someone else take the battle (and there usually isn't so much benefit for that person).

The precursor to Iliad and although similar if you like that game this will be disimilar enough to be worth a buy.

RATING: 7.5
I've been eyeing this game for a long while and when I've found a cheap German copy online I took the plunge. But that was but a beginning of a journey. Tried it with eurogamers and it didn't lift off the ground, I suspected it's them, not the game, but was hard to really position the problem. Yeah, it fell flat. Played it with 2 groups of much more relaxed people who are also both more familiar with card games and then it all made sense. The game is basically traditional card game meets Risk and the fights in the game, are actually bidding. The first trick is managing your hand through various rounds and picking your "battles" (auctions). The second trick is in combining this with negotiations and groupthink. The whole idea of the game is in passing the buck - [i]there is a player who needs to be stopped? Great, I'll pass, I'm sure you guys can deal with it.[/i] The reason the game didn't work with eurogamers was in them evaluating their hand and thinking they're only as strong as their hand, but that's not true as your bad hand is a bargaining chip and a stong hand comes with a duty to stop other players with a strong hand. When it all works it's a beautiful game of risk managment against assestment of other players, sometimes a game of chicken, sometimes passing the buck. Really happy I bought this. 

My edition is FFG, yet I haven't played it with FFG rules yet - Eurogames edition rules are simpler and push more towards psychology which is what this game is about.

has similarities to battle line. play cards to win 5 territories or win 3 adjacent territories. Except, more players can play, and managing your hand is crucial because if you run out of cards, your out. that is, until the last person has play their cards, then you are dealt back it. This game certainly has more "take that" than battle line. But equally good game.

[7 plays] 3,4,5, and 6 player games. Nice game. Board game element is fairly discreet, instead this is mostly a card game that is about hand management, psychology, and bluffing. It will play well with a decent sized group that is interested in having a good time with this type of game. May fall flat with folks seeking something deeper. I really enjoy it despite the fact that luck of the draw can result in some major screwage. 

Played 9-14-07 with Gail, Jerry, Mindy, Garrett, and Mike. Most recent play Feb '16.

RATING: 5
OK, let me say that the cards are really gorgeous. In the game, players are using numbered cards to win battles. Once a player has 3 adjacent territories, he/she wins.

That aside, the gameplay is ok: number crunching with the ocassional use of special cards and some bluffing.

The rule that allows a player 2 extra cards for territories is just a little on the strong side.

Seems to be quite luck based as far as getting the right cards is concerned.  If you're the only one not in a battle you lose out from the fact you are sat twiddling your thumbs then have to just throw away your cards as no-one else has any left.  Seems to work OK with 4 though.

Card, Hand Management. Really enjoyed this. It is similar yet different from Iliad from the same designer. It is a little more abstract but still plenty of conflict and probably more clever card play than the other. I think the hand-management is a little tighter here, too.

Update: after a couple more plays, I find the board adds tremendously to the game strategy. A city that can win or lose you the game obviously alters your play in a particular battle, and there is some strategy in choosing which city to fight over. Bumping this rating up a half point.

Nicely concieved card game, where players bid to control regions through their cards.  Beautiful artwork really add to the joy of the game, but overall I never felt engaged. That said the artwork is downright fabulous.

There is an irritating bit to the game where it is possible for the two people left in the round can just make a deal to choose different regions and capture them with one card trading this ability back and forth.  A real joy killer.

Strangely simmilar to Kill Dr. Lucky in the aspect that you sometimes force other players to use up their cards in order to stop others from winning.  I would imagine that this strategy could backfire.

UPDATE: First I gave this game a 7 just because I thought it had some good ideas, I then dropped it to a 5 because of my irritation of heavy contests that devolve down to who gets the best cards, and bonus card advantage to the leaders.  That's not to say that good play will won't the game, rather it is not a whole lot of fun to lose.

UPDATE: I now never want to play this game again.

Ugh.  This game is WAY too random, as you basically are screwed if dealt a bad hand, and a strong hand will generally give you victory.  There is a small amount of strategy in deciding when to enter a battle (or leave one), but that's about it.  I like the big cards, but that's about all I can say good about it.  Definitely OVER-RATED!  I recommend Il Principe as an excellent alternative to this one.

Condottiere is a card game of bidding and bluffing for territory on a map of Italy. Good strategy involves picking your battles and reading and manipulating others, playing them off against each other. I knew I'd like it before I played, just from reading the rules, so I picked up the Eurogames version in a trade, and I'm glad I did; the cards interact more intuitively than in Fantasy Flight's redesign. I also like the tarot-style cards. The player count is a lie; 4p or 5p is best. 6p is acceptable. Otherwise, play something else.

While I much prefer the length of the 3rd edition, it does set up a situation where some players can not win the game, but must continue to play.  So much depends upon getting good cards.  I wish they had come up with a game where everyone had the same deck to help balance that out...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The board shows a bunch of provinces in Italy, each with 1 city. Players each get a hand of 10 cards (  2/city controlled). At start, the Condottiere is randomly chosen; later, it's whoever won the last battle. Condottiere chooses a city to battle over, and plays 1 card. Players in turn either play a card or pass -- continue till someone plays either the Surrender (battle ends immediately; resolve as normal) or Bishop (no battle occurs; all played cards discarded; Condottiere rotates to left), or all players pass. Then resolve cards played. Cards are either Mercenaries (base strength 1-6 or 10), Heroines (str 10), Scarecrow (str 0; when played, allows you to return a card to hand), Winter (str 0; reduces all Mercanaries' base str to 1), Drum (str 0; doubles str of YOUR Mercanaries). Highest sum wins: place control marker in city, and become new Condottiere. If no one wins, pass Condottiere to left. After a battle, all played cards are discarded; also, players MAY discard all their remaining cards if no more Mercenaries left in hand. Continue the Round till only one person has cards left in hand after a battle; resolve battle, then round ends. Deal new cards and start over; game ends when any player controls 3 adjacent cities = winner (4 cities in 2/3er game). If all cities conquered with no winner, player with most cities wins (no tiebreaker).

Good game! Some similarities to Taj Mahal, but plays more quickly. May play better with more players and/or with higher goal to win -- luck of the cards may be too important otherwise.

RATING: 7
This game has been built on an interesting idea, but there is something it lacks. 
The less players, the more random it gets , with  a 2 player standard rules game being decided completely by the cards they get.  
It gets a lot better with 3  players, but still the random factor is a bit too high for my liking.
What I like about it is the art on the cards, the interesting tactical possibilities provided by the special cards, and that it is quite quick.
The small size of the board and the box makes Condottiere an ideal game for taking along for a longer train trip  or a similar travel. 
I give it a 7.

I want this game to be more entertaining than it is. A good concept stumbles on high downtime issues once you are out of a fight.

It's also very challenging to predict how long the game will last. I *want* Condottiere to be a filler game, but that's not always the case. Sometimes it is 20 minutes, sometimes it is 45-60.

This should never have been published with 2 players on the box.
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/251125

To mitigate this issue, we played with each player drawing back up to 10 cards at the end of each turn. This worked ok, but still was lack-luster.

I do think it will work really well with 4+ players and look forward to trying it.

A quick, portable small box game with easy to grasp rules where you battle to control territories on a small game board using your hand of mercenary soldiers, special character cards, and, more importantly, cards that break the rules, add chaos to the game, and frustrate other players' plans.

RATING: 3
[One play] A slogging game of tedious number adding.  The frequency of forced discards makes it difficult to even 'pass' a battle to build up constructively.  Getting one of the 'key' (alliance?  treaty?) cards is incredibly powerful.  Reminds me vaguely of Havoc: The Hundred Years war, but Havoc is much faster playing and far more interesting, with actual choices of hand management. The one point I'll give Condottiere is that its nice to include the 10 strength heroine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An interesting game which almost feels like a trick-taking game.  Going last is incredibly powerful in this game.

I like the variety of cards and how things constantly get messed up.  There's a lot of chaos when you play with 5 or 6 but it makes the game a lot of fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Both simple to understand and deceptively strategic. The aim of the game is to conquer a set number of regions in Renaissance Italy and this is achieved by constructing battle lines of cards with varying strengths. You always have to consider what cards your opponent might possess as well as your own i.e. you can't just play your weaker cards first and build from that as you may fall victim to the surrender card, which instantly ends that combat turn, and greater strength cards can fall victim to the nullifying effect of the bishop card. Presentation is basic (it has one of the smallest boards possible) but that doesn't detract from the game at all. I do however feel that the replay value of the game is a bit limited due to the repetitive nature of simply playing cards to conquer regions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
OK game, but I found it rather too dependent on luck, and a bit too easy for one player to draw ahead of the rest. Being a quick game saves this from damaging the "fun factor" in the game (i.e., at least you don't spend an entire evening knowing you have already lost). Taj Mahal has pretty much all of the same gameplay elements, and is a far superior game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This game was fun and enjoyable.  The random factor is high, and some skill can be used to overcome the difference, but watch out for the leader.  Cards are cool, but a bit hard to shuffle for smaller hands.  2004/06/17

I have mixed feelings about this game.
The basic idea is good, and the FF edition has beautiful materials (the map is simply adorable), but I feel like the turn mechanics are kinda clumsy.
I recommend avoiding the third edition rules and just play the 2nd edition because it's much more balanced and simple.
Basically ditch courtesan, spring, and favor of the pope token. The bishop card becomes "end the current battle: nobody wins it" (as opposed to the surrender card where the battle ends and the player with the highest current sum wins).
Guaranteed to be much more fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's an excellent two player battle mechanic that is quite bizarrely married to the concept of multiple players having a multi player battle. This has no connection to real warfare although I get the idea of the Italian city states. Still one player can create a showdown and lose the whole battle for four other players. It's not history and it takes the strategy out of your play. However, the mechanics are well worth checking out similar to Iliad, and Clash of LIght Sabers to name a few. Not great game, but good creative mechanics.

tl;dr: nah, not for me

Yeah, some games just aren't made for some people. This game is not for me.
The main mechanism is: play cards of different values. Whoever lasts the longest (has the highest value at the end of the round) wins a region. Win enough regions and win the game. The problem I have is that the game simply is too unpredictable. I guess that is what many people like about this game, but having cards that can bring a 10 point card down to 1 point and take away any chance you had at winning. Quite often you have good cards and throw everything you have into a round because it seems you can't loose only to find out that you wasted everything on nothing because of a chaotic card that you knew could come up, but you have to try something, right?
So yeah, not for me.

How to describe this... It has aspects of area control, bidding... but it is mostly a game of bluffing and reading your opponents. There are times when the game ends too quickly (2 battles or so) but that is mostly due to inexperience on the part of the players.

A great little game that we often play multiple times in a row.

Update: The game can also drag on too long sometimes; over an hour is probably too long for this game and it turns people off.

Good bluffing game that serves as long filler in our group. I traded my Fantasy Flight version in for a copy of the original edition with the wood-cut artwork. The new edition is good, but I prefer the 1st edition rules and artwork. My one criticism is that players will often drop out of the bidding to force another seemingly reluctant player to commit cards. If that player is actually holding a poor hand, the entire game can end prematurely and somewhat anti-climatically.

RATING: 5
This is kind of an area control game where you play cards and try to win battles so you can control regions.  The interesting aspect is that you don't have to participate in a battle, so you can theoretically let everyone else use all their good cards, then try to claim a few regions for cheap.  However, if there is only one person left with cards, they have to discard and everyone draws back up.

So, there is some semi-interesting card management.  But, otherwise is a fairly bland card-battle, area control game that I don't need to play again.

A great card game full of feinting, counter-acting, swiftly overpowering the opposition or patiently biding one's time as others burn through their hands.  If you like hand management, you should like this game.

My main complaint is that the rich get richer when new hands are drawn.  I'd rather that each player is dealt up to 10 cards, regardless of how many territories the players control.  I house rule it that each player always draws back up to 10 to start the next round instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fight wars over territories with a fun card mechanic and no wasted time. Some problems exist with the end game, as well as players who do well being rewarded with additional resources resulting in a runaway leader problem.

All told, Condottiere is a beautiful, simple game that nevertheless captures so many of the things that make board gaming such an appealing hobby. Namely, stabbing your friends in the back. Lying to your friends. Betraying your friends. Burning bridges. Destroying relationships that took years to build. You know, that sort of thing.

The Good:
- Decent filler for 3-6 players, preferably as a warm-up game. 
- Fits into just about any group and you'll rarely find players unwilling to play. 
- The theme is good and fits to this game.
- It creates a great sense of accomplishment and the map is an extra bonus feature.

The Bad:
- The game is a combination of draw luck (lots and lots of luck) and some card management.
- There is a small runaway leader problem
- The cards are few and your options in battle even fewer. After a few plays you'll have figured the game out. Sessions from then on will depend significantly on luck.

You get a lot of game for the price and size of Condottiere. There are a lot of hard decisions in this and it can get pretty mean. Luck can be a factor too and I'm fine with that. Its a chaotic good time. Non gamers at work LOVE this game.

Update: Had a game where temporary aliances formed. It was really fun. I think our group might try to create rules for a team version on this.

Update 2: Played with alternate rules where 3 cards are drawn after each battle. Players only draw to 10 if all are out of cards. This is the best way to play the game. Adds more push your luck along with timing and card counting.

This one got off to a rocky start. After taking three whole weeks to arrive, due to some problems with the online retailer, my group didn't even finish our first game. My wife was chief among those that did not enjoy the game. I finally convinced her to give it another try (2-player) so that she could fully understand the mechanics involved. Not only did she enjoy that second game, but she has *never* gotten so excited as she did when she played winter, which turned my 10-strength mercenary unit into 1 point -- I countered by playing spring, which turned him into a 13, and she went in for the killing blow, with the pope. She actually shouted, "BOOM" and all but got up to dance in my face. This one is destined for my top 10.

Condottiere is difficult to spell and to pronounce. But the little box packs enough game for six players. In a way many recent microgames remind me of aspects of this game: small map, area control, influence markers and quick deterministic combat. I love how the seasons of Spring and Weather can upset the accumulated scores.

Top-notch, what-will-s/he-play-next game.  Dull with 2P, good with 3P, great with 4P, and maybe the best card game I know with 5-6P.  The tarotesque renaissance-style cards are my favourite in gamedom.

All comments are based on the Eurogames edition, not that debacle (though with nice art) by FFG.

I think Condottiere will have a wide appeal, not because of its theme or artwork, but because it can be played quickly and has a huge amount of interaction. The cards, while appearing simple on the onset (and this is a good thing for player level entry), actually can be used in several combinations to great effect. An engaging game that can fit into half an hour, Condottiere allows players the feel of war - but without a lot of dice rolling and epic battles. The card system makes the game what it is and will be found enjoyable by many. See my review for more details...

Perfetto! Actually, this game is about perfect for 4 or 5 players. But with just 3 it doesn't work at all. The game is short, and rewards cunning, while essentially remaining simple. Wish there were an expansion! (I am only rating the shorter second edition.)

FFG (3rd) edition. Another great game by Dominique and Duccio (the same authors as Serenissima). Condottiere is a relatively simple cardgame that is mainly about guessing, gambling, risk-taking and bluffing. And with 5 players, everyone had a blast with it! During those 45 minutes, players were often laughing and crying out in surprise or dismay, making for a lot of drama and a really good time. Even now, in 2011, I was surprised by its fun factor!
UPDATE: Make sure you play with people who "get" the suspense of bluffing and risk-taking - not everybody does. Also, better with 5 than with 4 players.

A small game that packs a big punch, and one of my stand-out surprise games from 2016. Simple mechanics, and enough difficult decisions to make it a good light-strategy game. Awful bend in the board though. Publisher needs to fix that.

A mediocre card game with a very unappealing theme. Again, luck of the draw is really a huge factor in winning this game. In our several plays, there was very little opportunity to stop the run away leader if certain overpowered cards were played such as the heroine. In addition, one person ends up having to stop the leader. I do, however, like the bluffing aspect of the game with the scarecrows and hope to see it incorporated in other card games. Pass

RATING: 6
The game that made auction-based gameplay fun for me! One of the most fun realizations I had was that some level of cooperation could be encouraged as a catch-the-leader check against runaway players. I don't mind that the 3rd edition changes make the decisions less tense: the strategy of playing and removing cards is still present and interesting.

This is a great option for a card game in the poker-weight territory that has the feel of a board game.  It's simple, but there's a lot of great hand management, pushing your luck, and trying to fake people out for victory.  Lots of surprises, cheers and jeers while you play.  Love that it also comes in a compact package and can play up to 6.  I don't suspect I'll ever get rid of this game for those reasons alone.

RATING: 5
In Munchkin, some player inevitably rushes to 9, and then all players work together to stop him.  Blocking another player from winning weakens your own position, so the real strategy in the game is convincing the other players that you are incapable of stopping the leader.

Unfortunately, Condottiere uses the same mechanic.  It is still a far better game than Munchkin, but I think the Munchkin dynamic really hurts the game.

So I know this game can be too random or even too long to play. And I know players can really misjudge the situation and let one player take over a lot of regions. But something about it keeps me coming back to play. I enjoy trying to keep my good cards ready until I know I can win in an important region. I like the scarecrow cards a lot and while the bishop, surrender, winter, drum and heroine cards are powerful I think their presence really adds to the play experience. They are like aces and kings!

Although the theme of Renaissance Italy is beaten to death, I enjoy this game.  When you tell folks they're going to be warlords and bring out the old big box version, people think they're in for some big old conflict-heavy wargame.  It's surprising to see that it essentially is a game of card management, and a clever one at that.  The tempo of card play and the decisions whether or not to pass make this game really interesting, and it plays VERY quickly.  This is a more-the-merrier type game, and is best experienced at the maximum of six players.

This game has a large deck of oblong cards and a fairly simple map of provinces in Renaissance Italy. The object of the game is to acquire four connected provinces. Game play is fairly simple as players use numbered cards to get the highest bid for a given territory. Unlike standard auctions, in which only the highest bidder loses their bid to the "bank", in Condottiere, every player loses their bid. Players are, in effect, bidding the number of troops they are willing to lose to win the territory. However, several special effect cards shake the contests up and keep the players guessing.

Very simple area control game with a neat bluffing element, but it's too random and unpredictable for my taste. 

Just remember - keep the player count low (I would say that 3 players is the sweetspot). Never play this game with more than 4 people, it's no longer a filler game this way, it just drags and the downtime gets unbearable, especially if you run out of cards too fast and all you can do is just sit and watch. 

By the way, there's a really ugly stalemate "glitch" in the third edition rulebook, you have to use some homerules or common sense to deal with it.

RATING: N/A
Micro interactive card game for area control of renaissance Italy provinces game board. Play from your hand sequential  English mercenaries of differing numeric strengths. Successive players decide whether to raise or fold. Winning merc value total claims the province. Players move the conflict and the Pope token. The thrill of the game comes from the anticipation and uncertainty of the Special cards' effect on the merc values. You are also torn on how much your are willing to commit for a province and when it is time to cut your losses to fight another day. Hands do not refill until everyone exhausts their mercs. First to control 5 provinces (or 3 adjacent) wins. Play scarecrow to get back one of your good cards. Cool that you can play surrender card on the other players. Pass option adds bluff strategy. Luck influenced. Hits a lot of gaming levels; negotiation, calculated risk, bluff, hand management, area control strategy all in a type clever package.

Decent area control/hand management game. Have to know when to play and when to bail.

I think it's totally broken with two people and it seems unfair that the special 2 players no hand effect apply, where is the hand management then with 2 people? I like the home rule to take three cards after each battle, it could fix this problem. With 3 or more people it's a totally different game, but it could be a little repetitive. I really like another card games to spend my time. A dissapointment, I was expecting more with this game.

Pienso que está del todo roto a 2 jugadores y se ve injusto que se aplique el efecto especial para 2 jugadores de no tener cartas en la mano, ¿donde queda la gestión inteligente de la mano? Me gustaría si se añade la regla casera de robar 3 cartas tras cada batalla, podría solucionar el problema. Con 3 o más personas es un juego totalmente diferente, pero puede ser un poco repetitivo. La verdad es que me gustan más otros juegos de cartas en los que ocupar mi tiempo. Una decepción, esperaba más de este juego.

At one point, this was the most requested and most played game I own. Simple to play, quick to learn, and loads of fun... strategic, confrontational and affordable. Despite the board, it's really a card game. But not trick-taking or even climbing. It feels far more like an Auction game using the cards as currency, with a bit of bluffing and push your luck introduced by the special cards. Still one of my favorite "gateway" games to introduce people to designer style gaming.

I love to pull out this one when the guys get together. It is a very good, quick, fun game. Highly recommended! I just ordered the 3rd edition, and am quite excited to get it to the table. The only thing that I'm iffy about in the new rules, is how you can't fight over an already controlled region. It should have a huge impact on gameplay.

This is a nice light area control/card battle game.  I enjoyed the interplay of the cards (particularly the courtesan ability to determine the next province... even if you don't win the battle).  A solid filler for a small group.

RATING: 5
Far too random for my liking.  Reminds me of Ivanhoe and even to some extent the bidding mechanism of Taj Mahal, but certainly not as sophisticated.  I don't care for how one can win the game in as little as 4 rounds.  Not one I'd care to own or play very much.

Rating based on 2 playings.  May go up or down with more playings.  This is another game like Bohnanza which may be a "bridge" game, playing this before more brain-busting fare like Puerto Rico or Taj Mahal.  As it stands now, I like it.

I've played this game far too much. It's great for beginning gamers or those who love card games. A few killer strategies unbalance the game, however, and make it play very similarly in most games.

This game raises more questions than there are cards in the game. Chaos and full of holes, rules are a mess, and frankly, the game too.

After 2+ Plays: Incredibly fun.  Lots of game packed into a short length, and great components to boot.

After 5+ Plays: In light of the infrequency with which I actually suggest playing this game, I'm bumping it from a 10 down to a 9.  I still greatly enjoy playing it, but it's a game I'm fine only pulling out once or twice a year.

After 10+ Plays: Lowering rating from 9 to 8.  I still have a lot of fun with it when I play, but its flaws keep me from wanting to play it often.  

Note that my opinion is based on the older edition, as I have not played the newer Fantasy Flight version.

Good thematic, yet elegant and simple game. Not really recommended for two players, and I do not intend to rate this game until I've tried with two or more opponents.

Fantastic group fun. As we got to know it better, passing became more of a feature of the game, which diminishes the fun somewhat. UPDATE: The passing sort of ruins the game. Reducing the rating.

Played once with wife and son. My 12 yr old got it straight away, unlike my wife, and beat us with some very cunning and sneaky play. Such a great game. Huge amount of randomness from card pulls but the skill is in bluffing and planning ahead with what cards you have. We loved it and will be playing again.

Маленькая игра с полем. На поле сражаемся по очереди за провинции - сражаемся на картах. Карточная механика уникальная и изумительная. Присутствие поле обрамляет несколько раундов в полноценную игру и сглаживает действие случая от прихода карт в руку.

First playing made me feel like the game is horribly broken but after a second playing with CORRECT rules this time the game seemed a bit better. Still not a masterpiece, though.

I originally played the Fantasy Flight version of this game and found it merely okay. The version I now own is, in my opinion, considerably better - not only in its look and style, but in the gameplay itself. It is slightly simpler (which works for me) and the card distribution makes more sense.

A cute little game, from which develops some humourous (if frustrating) card battles. Worth playing until the shine wears off.

1/16/09 -- (FFG (3rd) edition) Condottiere is commonly called a game of bluffing, and it is to some extent, but I believe it's better defined as a game of brinkmanship.  But it's a game about many other things as well:  resource management, tactical withdrawal, manipulation and positioning.  It's really quite marvelous, in my opinion, with systems that are not immediately obvious.  

You should not put a lot of stock in the 6 player game, however, in case you care about my opinion.  5 would be better, and 4 better yet.

RATING: 7
A fun and quick dueling game with bluffing and a map to add some variety. Well worth the money.

Some in my group object to the randomness and the fact you can get suck with a lousy hand. For the most part though it's a solid game. It also appeals to family/non-gamers.

An excellent game. I find that it is best with 4 to 6 players, 3 is ok and a 2 you loose the inter-player bickering and deal making that I find most enjoyable.

Fun. I just wish there were a few more special cards, a few less 10s and way less Courtesans.

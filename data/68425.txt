Pleasantly surprised. My play log says I first played this in 2013, but I do not remember this game at all. I picked it up cheap on a whim at the BGG Spring Con flea market/bazaar, not thinking I would hang on to it very long, but I think we'll play this quite a bit. It is a nice mix of Dominion and RftG, though there isn't any conflict (not a bad thing necessarily, imo, since I hate "take that" as an artificial interaction mechanic). Maybe we'll pick up one of the expansions.

130929 Well now I love Glory To Rome over everything else, and in the meantime I've lost interest in eminent domain.  Something about it feels static-y or something...maybe I just don't like scifi themed games.

111025 Nice mix between dominion and glory to rome.  I'd pick it up if I liked the SciFi theme or artwork more but I find both bland.  I like the cartoonyness but still overall just bland.  And with RFTG, Dominion, GtR, San Juan I have too many games of this type and I don't know if this will hold up.  If i had a choice I'd replace RFTG with Eminent Domain, but I wouldn't go out of my way to do it.

I didn't love Eminent Domain when I first played it. It seemed a little over-complicated, and I didn't really grasp the lead/follow mechanic very well on my first play. With more experience with that mechanic, thanks to [thing=19857][/thing], I tried Eminent Domain again, and had a very different experience. 

The way the core roles fit together is very seamless, and integrating that kind of experience with a deck-builder is sheer genius. Most people will specialize on one or the other role, but you have the option to follow your opponents even if it's a role you have very few of. 

Eminent Domain's multiple paths to victory are nicely considered. I haven't tried Researching my way to victory, but have had a good success with a hybrid colonize/survey role. I'd also be curious to see how the military strategy could work -- could be a nice way to zig when others zag.

Overall, Eminent Domain carries a really pleasant decision space within a short play-time. Tableau-building is one of my favorite mechanics, and Eminent Domain mixes it up with a solid deck-builder, that doesn't overstay its welcome and provides a fun challenge. Every time I play the game it sticks with me for days to come, so I'm really looking forward to playing this one more.

First impressions after three games: 

A solid 7. It's clearly a well-designed and (almost over-)produced game that looks really nice and I kinda like it. It's no [i]Race for the Galaxy[/i], but a good card game nevertheless. I'm glad I backed it. 

I find it a bit dull and abstract, though, and there's hardly any theme (I mean, sure there is a theme, you just don't really feel it at all while playing). Can't really put my finger on what's missing, but somehow I feel something is.. Definitely need to play much more to really grok the game.

Too bad not too many people seem interested in playing it. My gf hates it (but then again, that was to be expected as she hates most games..).

An interesting game, but not that I'd care to own.  Maybe it's because I've always played with new players, but time between turns can get a little long.  Also, game terminology gets a little confusing.  Action should be something like "special ability", and dissenting should just be called drawing a card.

A very elegant mixture of deck building and role selection mechanics.  There doesn't seem to be a point of having the molded ships though.  Little black cubes would have been quite sufficient.  If there were a way to attack other players planets then I would have given this a higher rating.

minor deck management but without the constant reading of the text.

LIKE: space theme. the cards are the same, so no need to read the little print, except for tech cards. multiple paths to victory. my rating went up after a few plays.

DISLIKE: the game was a bit difficult to explain. the rules suggest not using the tech cards, and that can make it easier for new players. new players seem to get frustrated, need to figure out how to streamline the game for new players. the rules don't explain some of the tech cards explicitly enough, which can add confusion.

Un deck building bastante chulo, aunque las partidas que he jugado da la sensación que se terminan demasiado pronto y no da tiempo a desarrollarte un poco mejor. No se, eso me ha dejado bastante frío. 

Habría que probarlo con expansiones a ver... porque lo de las naves de plástico de varios tipos, como en el eclipse, sólo como contadores... va! es sobreproducción exagerada si no hay mecánicas que las hagan servir para algo más...

My favorite Deck Builder. Itches the same scratch as Race for the Galaxy, without the oppressive learning curve.

A 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate,) in deck building form? Indeed! I love this game. It scratches the same itch as Race for the Galaxy, yet is far easier to play and it's name doesn't get confused for some kind of interstellar gran prix. 

My only complaint is that I don't get to play it more often.

This game is niether a ironic attempt at making a Hitchikers Guide to the Galaxy game or a game about a intergalactic government forcing planets to sell their land so that it can build walmarts on them. It is a medium weight galactic civ game that incorporates a deck building mechanic to move the game along and whose only sins are that it incorporates a very popular mechanic I never really liked too much and that it is a sort of "middle child" of galactic civ builders in my family of board games. The mechanic I am referring to is the ability to follow suit when someone plays a like card like you would see in Glory to Rome and Puerto Rico. The "middle child" thing is that every time I wanted to get this game to the table to try it again and give it a fair shake, my attention went to other games about galactic civ building like Among the Stars, Core Worlds, and Roll for the Galaxy. Perhaps the expansion has made it better or I should give it another try. If someone asks me to play it before I get an offer to trade it for something, I wouldn't be opposed to the idea.

This is a blend between RTFG and Dominion, with a little San Juan built in.  The problem is, the interesting mechanic of picking the right role that doesn't benefit your opponent doesn't matter much.  You can almost play in a vacuum and have it still work out ok.  I'd like to be forced to strategize my role picking.

Indeed a much better refined deck building game than Dominion ever was or will be.

With limited choices and deviation with technology cards, snatching VPs even on your opponents turn is a big plus. Does away with the solitaire part of such deck building games.

The production and trade mechanic brings a good add on to the theme and produces a logical VP that links well to the game system and theme.

Nevertheless, it still falls victim to repeated plays on such deck building games.....boredom sets in as eventually gamers will see it as nothing more than an exercise on 'shuffling'.

Good effort wasted on a lousy mechanic.

This one was really bad, I can't see how it's ranked as high as it is. If you wan't deck-building this is not the game you want cause you have no real control of your deck. And you don't have any time to build a deck of combos either. The game end is too easy to achieve for a rushing player which makes the settling-strategy too simple and too effective. Very boring game I though.

Take a deck building game and make it one mechanic in a different game and that's what you get here. The deck building is one aspect of the game. Nice idea and nicely done in this game. The turns get a little samey after a while though. I like the level of player interaction in the game. That's one thing that I haven't liked about some of the deck building games that are out. Too much interaction though, as in Nightfall, is overkill. I think the designer got the balance just right here. All of the strategies that I have tried seem pretty balanced and the games I've played have been tense and enjoyable. Overall a solid game with no negative aspects but the games I've played have seemed a bit dull. It's a well thought out game that is fun but overall I don't think there is anything super special about the game. I doubt it'll be breaking into many players top 10 lists any time soon but it's a good 8 in my book. However, I can see this game getting downgraded in a couple of years as designers take the deck building idea new places in future games. Sure it was one of the first to do something different with deck building but I doubt anyone will remember that in 3-5 years unfortunately.

A slower drafting game, Eminent Domain tends to have very satisfying individual turns. As you settle or conquer planets, your economy grows, allowing other tasks to become easier which in turn makes other tasks easier, all the while you're trying to slim your deck down so that it doesn't bog with useless duplicates. Unfortunately, the "slimming" part falls flat since removing cards from one's hand is too costly and usually never has enough thinning available. The result is that the midgame to endgame is just bogged for every player, even ones who are thinning like mad. It's a bit overproduced and certainly those ugly Buck Rogers ships that you see in every space game are unwelcome. Ultimately, while some of the middle of the game is fun, the end game payoff is almost always a wet noodle. You do all this work and it comes down to point salad at the end. Also, unlike Dominion getting one extra action per turn is completely broken. I recommend not allowing players to take "Productivity" as rushing to 7 research for it is the strongest and easiest guaranteed win strategy in the game. The game takes over an hour to play even when not trying to be competitive, so the payoffs are rarely worth it for a game about as in-depth as faster deckbuilders such as Star Realms or Dominion.

Update: Demoted to a 4. This game never sees play anymore because of the obvious and irreparable flaws. Some of the strategies being outright broken and unstoppable combined with the insanely long play time make it a lot less appealing than other deckbuilders out there. It's way too competitive a genre to tolerate this nonsense.

An interesting game, but one whose whole does not seem to match the sum of its parts. Each element added together should make a very good game, but something about how the different pieces interact just does not synergize well. 

Also, the planet conquering/settling mechanic feels odd. There should be some kind of benefit or detriment to using one method vs the other. It's thematically and mechanically weird. 

EmDo is still a cool, unique space themed deck builder. But it makes me want a bit more.

Pros
- Tech tree is fun to explore
- You get to at least do something on other people's turns so the downtime is smaller
- Multiple paths to victory
- The cards are pretty nice quality
- Warships are fun to look at
- Good length 

Cons
- You're going to need to pass the rulebook around or make colored copies so everybody can see what Techs are available to them in the future
- An experienced player has an edge
- Colonizing concept is hard to grasp at first

Purchased Eminent Domain with both expansions in the delivery package. One play of vanilla Eminent Domain under my belt, and -- all in all -- Jen and I found it a nice, albeit light, diversion. 

+ The game play was fun. 

+ The techs and planets seem fun, in concept. 

However, if we didn't have Escalation and Exotica, I'd probably find it a touch tame, and lacking in variety. The core/base experience is certainly fun, and would be better than scrabble for passing the time whilst trapped someplace (cruise ship? I don't know, never been on one), but I probably wouldn't seek it out unless my options were really limited. 

That said, I highly suspect escalation will add the needed depth to put it over the top. 

Only major minus, thus far, is the game is a touch long for what it is (and I feel the same about Dominion). I found myself making strategically suboptimal decisions just to drive down the clock (and cheated to close the game out by taking two cards to empty the game closing stack--a move which spoke to my desire to see things end rather than a wish for competitive gain). 

Worth adding I purchased this till fill a card game void, and I think it works nicely. A few more plays will help me decide if the experience is just too long for what it offers (and, if that's the case, I'll experiment with removing cards from the stacks to find a sweet spot). 

Humm.. Not sure about the rating here. Right now? 6/10 seems about right. 

I suspect that will go up.

I'm a great fan of Race for the Galaxy and Eminent Domain puts us in a very similar place in space.  Here again are planets, technological enhancements, military options, production and trade.  Yet it seems a bit emptier in Eminent Domain's part of the universe.  There's little of the clutter of icons that is found in RftG.  That's in some ways a good thing as it shortens ED's learning curve; and yet it makes me wonder about replay value.  While ED offers alternative strategies, I'd expect next game's colonization strategy to play out pretty much the same as this one's.  For now, I'm quite enjoying ED's blend of mechanics pilfered from RftG, Dominion and Glory to Rome, although I fear it may not last.

ED's artwork isn't memorable, but at least it stays out of the way of the game.  Production quality is decent.  We struggled a little with the rules.

Update:  another play and, as I feared, ED has shown me nothing new.  Its merits remain that it is easy to learn and a well-honed design, with no rough edges.  However, I don't expect to play it again unless others request.

Sci-fi Euro with role selection and lots of different paths to victory.  This caught my attention a while ago, and since I've played it several times I've learned to like it very quickly.  The different powers of playing cards during the Action or Role phases really changes how I've previously viewed hand management.  That said, the base game has a lot of sameness to it, and while you can end up trashing lots of cards quickly through Research actions, I find that the out-of-the-box experience is a little bland.

However, adding Escalation to Eminent Domain is incredible!  I think the base game is still fine without this expansion (it's not a game whose first expansion is "the other half of the base game").  That said, what Seth Jaffee added to Eminent Domain through Escalation takes the game to a whole other level.  Asymmetric starts through Scenarios are awesome, and all very balanced through tons of playtesting.  The level of interaction between different classes of ships as a resource for conquest and technology is very high and intuitive, the new technologies are awesome (looking at you, Double Time), and the tighter and clearer paths to victory really help streamline the game.  Again, the base game is still a good experience, but I highly recommend anyone interested in Eminent Domain to pick up Escalation as well!

My primary critique is game length. Every single time I play I feel that the game is too short--it ends too quickly. You necessarily run out the role piles faster than I'd like. My secondary critique is one of mechanics. Put simply, I'd rather play Roll for the Galaxy or Puerto Rio if I want good role-selection.

This is not a deck building game! Well... it almost is, but I'd rather place it in a category of its own. When people say deck building game, my thought runt to Dominion or games alike, but Eminent Domain is much more than that. The strategy is more complex, the game play is much longer than what is written on the box (-1 point) and the aim of the game is not to add as many cards as you can in your deck but rather have the right cards in the deck at the right moment.

Eminent Domain is an innovative game, it plays well in two - which is not typical for games that are not especially designed for two - and ... well, I want to play it again

This one put Race for the Galaxy on the trade list. It is such a simple deck builder but with enough strategy to keep it from being too easy. Components are awesome but what can you expect from Tasty Minstrel Games. We do wish the technology cards were handled a bit differently. We hate having to keep referring back to the rule to see what we can get as ALL the tech is available from round 1. We think it might work better by categorizing the tech cards into levels that come out for purchases as the game progresses. But other than that this game plays perfect and without Race for the Galaxy's lexicon of iconography.

19 April 2012: After a few more plays, it seems like there's not that much game here.  It seems to be more or less the same thing each time, with the winner being the person who drew planets from the survey deck that best matched what they'd already committed to do.

17 Oct 2011: After one play, I like this quite a bit.  Rating may drop a point or two after repeated play if there isn't much inter-play variability.

There's something about the feel and artwork of this game that I really like. Also, I like the "role-building" mechanics very much. However, whenever I play it, I always feel like there's something missing; a bit more variety maybe, or a little more interaction. I'm not sure. Still, it's fun and has a good ratio of strategy / rules.

An interesting twist on the deck-building genre.  After one play, I'm not sure how well I'll like it.  There's not a whole lot of variety in the cards that are available, and it feels really repetitive after a while.  The game has been compared to Dominion, RFTG, and Glory to Rome, and I like all three of those better as of right now.

This could be described as Race for the Galaxy meets Dominion - except that does a disservice to all the games.  Race is a longer, more complex game.  Dominion is.... well go look at my comments on that one.  And saying that the game is between these fails to give credit to what Eminent Domain brings to the table.  The core of the game play is deck building, but the action each turn by others and the ability to control how the cards in your hand are managed really bring the game to a higher play level.  Game play is quick and this is another advantage to the design.

A solid meat and potatoes deck builder with a space empire theme. It's not as good as RftG, but it doesn't have the teaching overhead which does give it appeal with new players.

To be completely fair, I had read two negative reviews before playing this game, which probably influenced my opinion on the game.

Yet I came away feeling unimpressed by this game. First, from the name to the planet art, this game is very dry and with almost no chrome. I would go as far as to say this is the driest euro game I've every played.

Second, I've come away feeling that I know how the system works and how to work it, something that happens to me rarely in games. I would contrast to Glory to Rome, which after one play I feel like still. This might be indicative of the lack of depth in EmDo and wealth of depth in GtR. Perhaps it's because I've played so much RftG, which this game shares most of its engine-building characteristics.

Still, it's fairly easy to learn and quick to play. I would give it a few more plays before giving it a final verdict.

After two plays, I think that there's something there. I'm not sure what it was, but it didn't excite me. (After my first play, I kept turning down games of this. Never a good sign. I played again, and won ... with a produce/consume engine, even. But I was bored).

Unlike the games people mention in the same breath (Dominion, Race, G2R), it has no obvious differences in setup from game to game, apart from the starting worlds. So I feel no need to explore this further. You have to make sure not to get left off a bandwagon, but try to keep people from leaching.

I see Eminent Domain as the Frankenstein's monster of card games. Its designer took various parts from at least three great card games (Race for the Galaxy, Dominion and Glory to Rome) and put them together. Is it the definitive card game? Definitely not. It is an enjoyable game and very well produced indeed. It is a game I intend to explore for sure. But the initial sensations are not stellar. Tentative initial rating is 6 (so, for now, I feel Eminent Domain is worse than its three "ancestors"...).

RATING: 6.5
This rating is after a few plays of the base game. The base game screams out for incorporation of the expansions and bonus planets for replayability/more interesting plays. However, the mechanisms seem to be a good mix of deck-building, tableau building and a GtR-style follow interaction.

Edit, June 2017: I like this game quite a bit. It just fits in a weird space where other games get pulled out more often. I find that it's a little more opaque to new players than other more typical deck builders. I also find it a bit less accessible to new players than Roll/Race for the Galaxy. Roll/Race's accessibility is dependent, primarily, on understanding iconography. This game requires players to be comfortable with both some iconography/card abilities and some atypical game mechanisms. This game likely needs a dedicated group willing to stick with it for a long time. I want to give this game a 7-8, but, sadly, I can't due how much it gets played. The idea of it really appeals to me and the interesting mix of mechanisms will allow it stay in my collection for a long time.

Deck builder that employs action following mechanics, somewhat reminiscent of Puerto Rico / San Juan / RftG. Tight, excellent game play with frequent difficult decisions and a rewarding weight vs time ratio.

AP can become a problem, particularly while research actions are being executed as each card needs to be individually examined. Otherwise, downtime is relatively little, particularly because you either take a mini action or draw a card on every opponent's turn.

This is my deck builder of choice. I also enjoy tableau building. I don't have time or the playgroup to play a serious civilization game. So, this and 7 Wonders has to do it for me. I enjoy the science fiction theme. The art and graphic design is excellent. This wouldn't be ranked nearly as high if not for the expansion - Escalation. It really rounds out the base game. I enjoy the ability to piggy back on your opponent's actions similar to Puerto Rico. I haven't played Exotica yet, but I expect it will further expand your options. This is an excellent two player game that plays well at higher player counts.

First Play: Suggested for an end of evening filler+. It became clear that to play successfully you need to know what the tech cards are capable of but when they are upside down and diagonally opposite you across the table you will be struggling in the dark. Our game had no player interaction and no use for collecting different resources. Apparently some set ups address this. Seems to be a rehash of well trodden mechanisms (Puerto Rico and RftG) but the repetition and general lack of meat makes this the blandest of experiences. Seems to appeal to the Dominion fans but predictably left me cold.

Sort of a cross between a deck builder and a role selection game.

Really solid deck-builder with an awesome theme- conquering planets. What sets it aside is the fact that, when one player chooses an action, the other players have the option to follow and take a less powerful version of that action. This means little downtime. On top of this, there's plenty of strategy to be had within the few simple decisions you make each turn.

Low complexity deckbuilding game. This game is not just hitching along the deckbuilder craze though. The designer has managed to add enough twists and original idea to the game to make it a very original offering. Furthermore it is one of the few deckbuilders that actually makes some sense themewise, which is a nice bonus. Game seems a little long with two and a little short with 4 players. Maybe something that could be fixed with some house rules. Or maybe we'll just have to accept 3 is the sweetspot for this one.

Played a few play-tests.

After playing Race for the Galaxy, Dominion, and Glory to Rome; I find that I like Eminent Domain more than Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome.  The deckbuilding aspect is their as a mechanic and not the whole game so it is actually quite different from Dominion.  Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome are both very dependent on what cards become available and rather you can get your strategy going based on that.  Eminent Domain allows you to build your strategy and manipulate it over the course of the game.  I see a great advantage to this.  It's also fairly simply so teaching to new players should be easy.

I can't wait to get a copy.

This seems like a pretty well designed game, but not one that will be in my collection. It's very similar to several others and, while it seems decent, I don't think it separates itself from the crowd.

Kickstarter Limited Edition FINALLY arrived. Box #15/500 Played a few times tonight, not sure I'm 'getting' it yet...

Some notes:

- I like the way that following has a variable relationship to leading. Leading the same thing too often ends the game really fast and pads out your deck with the wrong cards. On the other hand, if you ca leech off another player for warfare or colonise, you get full utility out of your deck without draining the stacks. Learning to manage that seems like half the battle.

- The game feels partly (and oddly!) unfinished - there are four types of resource but this only has an effect when a given technology comes into play. There are three types of fighter token, and they feature int he game art (which suggests they knew beforehand that these components would be int he game), yet there is no rules distinction drawn between the three tokens.

- The cards are very crappy quality. They are thin and flimsy. I didn't sleeve my RftG cards, and after over a hundred plays they are looking very used, but mainly around the edges and they look more worn than banged up. After only three plays of ED the cards were starting to show wear, and that bad kind of wear where the printed face peels back a little bit from the cardstock, leaving chunks of white showing through.

- Personally, I don't like the art. It's too cartoony. I'm warming up to the graphic design of the cards, which at first I thought was too colourful for a space themed game.

- On a related note, selling off the option to name cards during the kickstarter process has made for some VERY strange planet names. Some are called totally outlandish things like  'Warlord Betzel's Domain' (or whatever), while others are names in reverse (like 'Sednim', Mindes backwards), while still others are just people's names ('Evan Platt'). It makes for a very incoherent set of names and bugs me in a small way.

- Benj pointed out that warfare and colonise work very unthematically, and the name of each role should be reversed (while the mechanic remains identical) - Thematically, your fleet would be tied up on a planet and would come back to your deck all at once (the way colonise works), while colonists would be slowly built up and then would permanently be assigned to a planet, reducing your pool (the way warfare currently works). It's not a problem, just an interesting observation.

- While I haven't yet plumbed the depths of complexity available through the tech tree, I can't help but feel the tech tree is too limited. I really want twice the number and variety of tech cards.

- Similarly, I don't think the game scales well because you only get 16/20 of each role card. 4 players is quite short, 2 players can drag on. More cards and variable stacks would seem to make more sense.

- Some strategies (trade/produce, I'm looking at you) seem REALLY hard to manage without draining the deck super fast. I'm coming from RftG, where produce/consume can go on forever and the other players have to race to finish the game to stop you winning, while military is a fast 'rush' strategy, in EmDo it's almost exactly the opposite.

- Despite my two comparisons (one in terms of card quality and the other in terms of strategy), comparisons to RftG are vastly overstated, as are comparisons to Dominion. The only thing EmDo shares with RftG is a few similarities - the broad theme, the word 'settle' and the dual produce/trade role. Role selection in EmDo seems more inspired by Glory to Rome, but comparisons there are overstated too. In Rftg, almost every card is unique, and you need to carefully slot it into a strategy. In GtR there are three copies of each card, but each has a specific effect. in EmDo there are basic generic role cards that form most of your deck, plus research cards that let you make tiny tweaks to the deck.

- That's not to say EmDo isn't derivative - it really is. The only mechanic I personally have never seen before is the learning deck - as you do actions your deck gets better at them. The inclusion of that is extremely clever, and makes the game pretty different to everything else in the Deckbuilding category.

An enjoyable deck-building and role-selection game.  I'm anxious to play again, mostly because I'm still not sure which card combo's work best to milk the system for victory points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It has role selection very much like Glory to Rome.  It has planet colonize / conquer / produce / trade like Race for the Galaxy.  It is slightly "deck-building" like Dominion / Thunderstone / etc etc etc. (but really it feels more like "deck-clogging" than "building" with all of the role cards you have to take.)

So, it has aspects of several games that I like, but I don't think it uses any of these aspects as well as their originators.  They just feel forced together, and it doesn't seem to jive well.

I appreciate that there are very few unique cards to learn and the mechanics are very straightforward, but in the end it just isn't a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a solid, fast-flowing deck builder which is streamlined and doesn't involve too much AP and card-reading each turn. It has some similarities with Race for the Galaxy, but without the depth of strategy that involves. As a result, however, it has a much more comfortable learning curve  and is much lighter fare. Not convinced yet of its replay value, suspect it might get a bit samey, but not played it enough to tell yet.

A winner.  My only deck building game, and I love it.  It's easy to get into, keeps you engaged on each players' turn and has enough strategy to keep it interesting.  Haven't tried the expansion yet, but looking forward to the "conflict" nature of some of the new rules.

This is a cleaner and more controlled version of RftG.  Having all the technologies open from the beginning gives players much more control over their game.  The game still has a solitaire feel to it and drags on for much too long.

Rated highly because it's a fun game with great art, but not a single original bone in its body.  I feel like I'm playing Glory to Race for the Dominion, 1/3 of each with no new ideas of its own.  Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing, those are three great games you're taking mechanics from.

RATING: 7.5
A solid deck building game, possibly the first I saw which really broke strongly away from Dominion mechanics. I like the way decks specialize themselves. Still, the game seems to end too early, and too often from the same cards running out. I get the feeling this could have baked for another six months, but as one of the early Kickstarter hits the schedule might have been off.

Less than average deckbuilder, up there with Nightfall.  One victory path, meh production, the WORST run Kickstarter campaign to date, and as a bonus it's rated a 10 by the designer and publisher, who are the types to gripe about manufactured ratings, and in Seth's case be extremely critical of well designed games.  Do yourself a favor and don't bother.

A nifty deckbuilder with some role selection added for the hell of it. The amount of control is impressive when building/tweaking your deck, and the decision to leave one pursuit for another - specifically the in-game timing of such a twist - is fascinating.

Eminent Domain is the crossbreed of Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome, but unfortunately I find it inferior to both. While the mechanisms work and the components are real eye candy, I suspect the game lacks the replayability of its forebears, mainly because once you commit to a strategy, you have no choice but to stick to it, i.e. there is less room for tactical moves. Not my cup of tea.

The most overhyped game of 2011 I thought. This one just doesn't capture my interest, probably since the different possible strategies can be counted on one hand.  It seems very much at its core a strict optimization game with very little in the way of creative elements.

Going into the start of this game I was thinking of it to much as a pure deckbuilder. Needless to say though I was alittle underwhelmed and confused. But once I realized that this is more of a strategy game then a deckbuilding one everything started to fall together. I definatly look forward to playing this one again in the future.

Race for the Galaxy... the Deck Builder! I thought I was going to hate this, principally because of the number of space-themed card games that are out there now. But I actually think it's a lot of fun. The choices are tough, and hand management is much more important than in other deck builders. I still don't know the techs very well, so I'll have to play around with them more before I feel comfortable with them. Even without them, however, it's a nice design, regardless of any similarities it may have to other games.

A very good game.  I am a bit worried about the replayability of it though.  I've heard that it works best with 3.  I've only played with 3 so I can't say how it plays with 4.  My understanding is that it can end too quickly with 4.

Update: It took several plays for me to get that "Aha!" moment and understand the game.  I bumped up my rating because of that.  I've now played it with 2 and 3 and it is a very enjoyable game.

Yeah, OK, I think the lights are on here but nobody's home. I haven't played a game where the point spread has been more than 2-3 - and that's between first and last, even with four players. There are some obvious game miscalibraitions that make it unwise and hard to do anything more than conquer and run up some tech. Produce/trade seems completely DOA. A shame, but the fact that the game is such a straight mash-up of pieces from much better games should have been a giveaway.
---
What's up with the title for this one? I don't understand what it's supposed to mean in this context. Kim wandered by and wondered if we were sleazy property developers getting local governments to expropriate property from old people and sell it to us to make a huge profit. It's a very strange title.
---
This is a clever mash-up of other people's ideas, and it does play reasonably cleanly and smoothly, but my strong sucpicion is that there isn't much going on here. The reinforcement of actions - you have to add a card to your deck for an action each time you take it - is the sole identifiable piece of originality, and it seems somewhat problematic - because it makes it so comparatively expensive to do anything you don't specialize in, and comparatively hard to change course, you get locked in to a course of action pretty early. Anyway, I don't want to judge it too harshly, because it's good for a few games, but I suspect the replay value will turn out to be low.
---
No rating yet, but first play was reasonably positive, even though I doubt the game has much staying power. It's completely unoriginal, being basically a mash-up of Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome, but it's pretty streamlined and compact. It doesn't quite feel right, the small hand size, often limited benefits for following, and the somewhat slow and uninteresting pace of colonizing and conquering leaves me feeling like it isn't quite balanced right, but there are interesting and different tensions in the deck management element. Worth trying out if you like the various games being ripped off.

RATING: 5
[i]2 plays.
4 players.

[/i]This is yet another game that has been out for a little while, but which LobsterTrap gave me a chance to take my first real look at. The first play went rather poorly for me, as I struggled to learn tech trees at the core of the game. Additionally, I forgot the endgame condition, leading me too over-invest in game strategies premised on a longer session. Because of this, I made an effort to play again before the end of the con just so that I could have an opportunity to play better.  In my second game, things ran more smoothly and I very nearly won. 

After two games, I am still not convinced that I would choose this game over [thing=28143]Race for the Galaxy[/thing]. However, it is an enjoyable game. If you are not already a Race fanatic, I can recommend exploring this as an alternative option. The games are not identical (and I hope that I am not implying that they are full substitutes). But, as mentioned above, I am not a fan of tableau games. And I do not see the need to own many games that share similar qualities. 

Some people have suggested that [thing=68425][/thing] is more akin to [thing=36218]Dominion[/thing]. I see where they are coming from, but I felt that it was much too tactical to support such comparisons. [thing=36218]Dominion[/thing] is a game that requires long-term strategy, chosen at the outset. [thing=68425][/thing], by contrast, seems to turn on see ability to manage one's hand, and to acquire technologies that allow for more efficient use of one's current cards. In this sense, it is more reminiscent of [thing=28143][/thing]. This is a decent game that I would likely play anytime it was offered, assuming there are no better options on the table. Mostly, this is due to the short duration of the game; 30 minutes or so with four players seems just about right and inoffensive enough that I wouldn't bother to push back against it at a game day. But neither am I enthralled with the game, so I think it ends up at roughly a [BGCOLOR=#9999FF][b][COLOR=#9999FF]_[/COLOR]6[COLOR=#9999FF]_[/COLOR][/b][/BGCOLOR].

Interesting game in which the expansion takes it up a hell of a notch.  Like a bastard child of Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome, and Dominion.

After a repeat play, I'm now not so sure.  The game is just a bit clunky and awkward to teach.  The technology deck is also a pain to be constantly fumbling with.  Not sure this game has a place with Glory to Rome already existing.

I am just not a fan of deck building in general. There is too much exactitude for me. Remembering how many of each card you have, and what is remaining in your deck, planning out sequences so the deck is giving you what you need when you need it. 

You would never be able to describe a move in a game like this as swashbuckling. There are no "oohs" and "ahhs" over the table. There is zero decision tension. 

And I can see this being harmless for a few plays, but I fail to see why games would be substantially different from one another after a few plays.

Meh! It’s a little mix of GtR, RftG, Dominion and such games, but it’s much worse than any of those… It really wasn’t engaging to play. Maybe it was because we played it with 4 with 3 new players, but it really didn’t click for any of the new players. In a 4p, it also seemed there is some luck concerning when you get to do the actions; I almost always ended up being half a round behind, meaning I needed to produce when the others traded and such (maybe it was just poor play). Of course you can plan your way out of a lot of this, but random card draws always make the game harder – it sucked so much when you just needed that other card or one more of that card etc… It also seemed as if there were only 3 viable strategies, and research should probably even be combined with others to be strong enough… But the settle new planets and produce goods seemed very strong indeed. Won’t refuse to play it (with 2 or 3), but won’t pursue it either.

It took a round or two for me to get this under my belt, but once I got the flow and understanding the differences between an action and a role I found it to play super smooth and actually enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I'm not a huge deck builder fan, but I actually felt like I was accomplishing something with EmDo. I definitely want to try this again as it really did surprise me. The only thing that bugged me was the techs and having to look through all of them to find one I want without knowing them.

I like the game, but it feels a little flat in some places.  There should be something more to do with resources.  There is no inherit meaning to the different ship sizes in the rules.  Like the early complaints about RFTG, there is no way to attack other players.  And finally, the Utopian and Prestige planets seem to suggest something more is coming.  I am sure there are some expansions planned for ED based on our first plays.  Though in some respects it is compared to RFTG as "RFTG done as a deck building game," it is not RFTG, and lacks depth and richness to compare to one of the highest rated games on BGG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A decent, albeit ultimately forgettable game. Mashes up deckbuilding, tableau building and role-selection in a somewhat interesting way, but the ultimate effect is watery and domestic, without the stimulating variety and unexpected card-synergies of Race For the Galaxy, or the strategic depth of Dominion. It is probably the best of the crop of post-Dominion deckbuilders I've tried (at least as far as pure card games are concerned), but that's really not saying much considering how much derivative shite followed in the wake of that classic. I'd play it again if there were nothing better on offer, but it would take a pretty grim set of alternatives.

Likes: A quick, high-depth game with pretty simple mechanics. With the following and dissenting mechanic, there is almost no downtime during the game as everyone plays on others' turns. Smooth game play and good theme.

Bought this game as a 'Race for the Galaxy' lite. But that is being unfair to this game and RFTG. While they share a very similar theme, they are uniquely different, and have different play styles. The biggest positive for this game is the simplicity of it's play design, and the ease of teaching it to new comers. These two features alone means it gets to the table more often than many other games I own.

If I have one complaint about the game, it is the quality of the cards - while they are gorgeous, they just don't feel very sturdy. This has been resolved by placing them all in sleeves, which actually works quite well.

Deck and tableau building card game.  Play goes in rounds.  A player first chooses and performs an action, or may skip that.  The player then must choose a role.  Other players may play cards of that role to follow or may draw a card from their deck instead.  In choosing a role, a role card is taken from the board and put into the player's deck.  This may be augmented with additional cards from hand.

The object is to add worlds to one's tableau by either settling or conquering them.  Most worlds are worth victory points, may generate extra symbols to augment roles, or may produce goods.  These goods can be sold for victory points.  Having enough worlds of a type allow one to research technology cards.  These cards, different for each of the three world types, provide better actions.  At the second and third levels, they also provide victory points.

Combining technology that aids in better production and consumption can be very powerful.

To compare this with Core Worlds is not really correct. They only share same theme and same year of release. But Eminent Domain relates more with RFTG (and somewhat Glory to Rome). Unfortunately the combos are quite simple, so it's not as deep as RFTG, which occupy more or less same gametime. So it's not really worthed.

RATING: 4
Components: Nice artwork on the planet and research cards. Good iconography. Very cool ships. The design of the role cards, though, which occupy the bulk of the game activity, is very plain.

Experience: Dominion + Race for the Galaxy, but without being as good as either. The overlap is so extensive that I don't see this game adding much to my gaming life. (It's a bit of a turn off for me how the roles map so similarly to RftG phases, how the starting deck size and hand size match those in Dominion, and how there are the same number of VP chips as in a 2-player game of RftG; just feels like a mash-up.) 

It's cool how cards can be used as actions, as roles, or to follow another player. But it gets really confusing when someone chooses their action, and we all think we can follow it, since we're using the same language to describe actions and roles.

Military seems much more powerful than colonizing, since cards don't get tied up on the table (and can thus continue to produce ships), and I needn't commit my ships to any particular planet until I have enough to conquer. I follow on colonize just to get the cards out of my deck for free.

Like in RftG, I can see there are some different strategies to employ. I want some diversity, because that will allow me to be flexible and piggy-back off my opponents, but mostly this seems to be a game of specialization, to pick a couple of roles that work well together and hammer them into the ground.

The game is over very quickly, but without being satisfying. Lives in the shadow of its predecessors.

Game is dry and rather unengaging.  The choices are logical - survey, colonize, research, militarize, etc., but the game is lacking in interaction.  It would have been much more interesting, had the players all been competing for these planets on a map, and given the opportunity to actually fight over the more choice planets and locations.

In short, I don't see a need for a deck-building version of Race through the Galaxy, that does absolutely nothing that Race doesn't already do.  This game feels like an excuse to use deck-building, when there was no need to actually do so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great card game. It's a cross between Dominion and Glory to Rome. 
It takes about 3 or 4 turns to get over the counter-intuitive parts, but once you do, it's plays great.
The standard 6 cards make up 80 percent of your hand which could lead to boredom, but I don't think it will. 
I enjoyed it a lot and plan to get it when it's released.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
I want to like this game more than I actually do, I think. I love the theme and the mechanisms, but it never quite seems to coalesce into a game that's as fun as I would like for some reason. Maybe it's the lack of *interesting* interaction between players? With Race for the Galaxy and Roll for the Galaxy, I'm trying hard to guess what the other players are going to do, which is inherently thrilling when you guess correctly, and that seemingly is just a lot less important in Eminent Domain.

RATING: 9
I like deck builders, as my collection will show. I like Science Fiction, so this is a no brainer for me, had to have it.

Thankfully, it's also really really good. :)

Unlike many a deck builder where you sit patiently awaiting your turn, thus game allows you to take actions on other players turns.

Plus in addition to building your deck, you're also finding and settling planets and researching technologies as well.

The planets are the main source of points (though you can get into producing and trading resources as well) and you can peacefully colonise them or cry havoc and go military!

It's a great game and the only reason I'm not giving it a 10 as it gets better with the expansions, so 9 it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Does not feel like Dominion in any way. Your deck is your civilization's memory and skill set that develops over time. The more you do something, the better you get at it, even if it doesn't help you and changing your culture from Warfare to Production/Tradecan be difficult, but sometimes necessary.

I like the game, but it is a little dry. There is not nearly as much screwage or nail-biting tactical decisions that exist in Glory to Rome or Puerto Rico. It is still a very solid game.

I'm really not sure if I like this one or not. It is, on the surface, somewhat more interesting than dominion.

One would expect property taken by eminent domain would become land available for public use, but no, it is to be exploited for resources and control.

This game was disappointing and underwhelming for me. Essentially all the cards are available from the start and there are only several of them. I didn't feel like I was building an deck that was an engine of progress and advancement because the cards were all the same. Sure as time went on I was able to play more of a card at a time, but it didn't feel fun or powerful to do so. With the relative lack of change in the game, it felt like it dragged on.

Pros: A mix of game mechanics from other games come together in an interesting blend. Some tactical and strategic decisions to make in terms of how to treat each card in hand. Deckbuilding, role selection, follow/dissent, tableau building with minor special powers.

I need to play this more.  I enjoyed it more with 4 players than I did when I played it with only 2.  Randomness of opportunity is mitigated by allowing you to choose your role on your turn letting you do what you want to do.  I could easily see myself falling into a rut in how I choose to play, but perhaps with a deeper understanding would learn to modify my play based on what planets were available to me.

Decent space based card game. A sort of [i]Race for the Galaxy[/i] meets [i]Dominion[/i] I suppose. Multiple paths to victory. Good art work.

There's no interaction, which is a downer. And after repeated plays I just didn't find it that interesting. It felt like it was over just as you got your deck set. I'd play again from time to time, but it's not something I'm clamoring for. I think [i]Core Worlds[/i] has kind of killed this for me.

It's a deck builder grafted onto San Juan-style role selection. The whole is less than the sum of the parts. There's not much variety; the resources, for example, are fungible, regardless of type, except when a certain few cards are in play. I suspect an expansion could perk this game right up.

To say that this is a "deck building" game is quite a misnomer. The game has a heavier "role selection" application to it.

I understand all the references to other games, but this particular game is a well thought out game system that takes its cues from other games.

That being said, what I find the most intriguing part of this game is its potentiality. I can see that with only expansions, the game can get even better.

My rating could go up on further plays, because I quite enjoyed my one so far.  But I do worry about long term replayability.  With different sized ships and different coloured production, neither of which currently has any in game use, I have to believe there are expansions coming.  If they can solve my replayability concern, then this is a real keeper.  Side note - the kickstarter bonus card is ridiculously awful.  It gives you effectively half a point, when for the same cost you can buy a two point card with other benefits.

A solid good-but-not-great game.  Its deck-building elements are a minor part of the game.  The true strategy lies in the technology cards.  Playing the planets that come to you and building a tech strategy around them is satisfying when it works well.

It has a feel that is surprisingly similar to Race for the Galaxy, while remaining a very different game.

Eminent Domain, by Seth Jafee, is a meaty card game that shares some lineage from Dominon, Race For the Galaxy, and, most noticeably, Glory to Rome. I went to BGG.Con with the expectation that I would play it, like it, and pre-order it through the Kickstarter program. That did not happen.

Eminent Domain is centered around role cards, each of which serves both as a tool for performing an action as well as a means to lead with a role or follow someone else’s role. These cards generally serve to allow a player to add planets from the draw deck into the play area in front of them, claim these planets to get their benefits, produce and harvest resources for victory points, or research new technologies that give special action powers and cards that are available for multiple roles.

On each turn, a player optionally plays a card for an action, leads in a role, thus adding a card of that role to the deck, discards any cards from their hand, and draws new cards until they hit their hand limit. This repeats itself over and over again until the game comes to a completion by either depleting the victory point pool or until a number of decks run out based on the number of players.

I found my plays of Eminent Domain to be enjoyable, but a bit repetitive. I am sure that there are all sorts of interesting strategies to be found in the game, but the lack of character in the cards, particularly in comparison to the games which it is similar to, held me back from really liking the game. With all of the other meaty card games that I own and like (7 Wonders, Innovation, Glory to Rome, Race For the Galaxy), and the amount of time I currently spend on these sorts of card games (not much), it just doesn’t belong in my collection.

Players are space travelling races, surveying and settling planets via colonisation or conquest.  A fast moving card game, where players on their turn play a card for an optional action, then play another card (which can be boosted with more like cards) for a role.  Actions and roles do stuff like survey planets, increase technology, conquer or colonise planets, and so on.  All this stuff is done through card play and deck building.  The idea is to get the most influence (i.e. victory) points through planet acquisition, trade and technology purchases.  This game borrows a lot of stuff from the recently heavyweights such as Glory To Rome, Dominion and the like.  To it's credit, it does feel different enough from the others, but the similarities sure are there.  It all leads back to the old gamer's dilemma of why play this when you can play Glory To Rome?  Perhaps if space is your thing...

RATING: 8
The game it's most similar to is Glory to Rome, but it's much less wacky and much less confrontational.  Despite the deck-building element, it doesn't actually feel much like Dominion at all.  I like it, though-- despite a lot of familiar mechanisms, it's clearly its own thing, and well-built.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Deckbuilding games come and go, but very few are elegant enough to not need lots of expansions to keep people interested.  Eminent Domain is one of those few.  The mechanics are simple, and yet the game play is deep and rewarding.  Although at first glance it seems fairly straightforward and one-dimensional, there is so much subtlety to how to play any given hand of cards that skill will almost invariably win out over luck, and to me that's the hallmark of a great game.  This is, to my mind, the best and most elegantly designed deckbuilder to date.

This is a game that got better as I played it more.  Each time I play my strategy gets a little better and I'm more able to roll with the randomness of a deck builder. The expansion's asymmetric starts make it easier to really get into your role as well.

Good game.  The rating has increased with more plays and I'd like to continue playing it.

I've been watching this for a while, and was apprehensive due to the label of "[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2664/deck-pool-building]Deck building[/url]", and some perceived similarities to [thing=28143][/thing]... but all that has changed.  My apprehension has evaporated after a 4 player game.
It has elements of deck building, but I didn't feel it was.  It has several different things going on like strategic paths to victory, role selection, and mitigating your deficiencies and your opponents strengths.  This is a very impressive "race" style conquest game.  Now it's a must-have.

RATING: 4
Played once.  Starter decks are standard, simple action cards a la any deckbuilder.  The issue I have is that the cards you add to your deck are mostly these same standard, simple action cards.  In other words, it felt like all you really do is play one of 5 basic actions over and over and over again while adding more and more of the same simple cards to your deck.  For me, deckbuilders shine with the combos that can be played - Ascension or Star Realms would be a great example.  This didn't have any of that.  Before buying, I read that ED incorporates a lot of mechanics, but doesn't do any of them particularly well and I found that to be true.

PERSONAL COPY. Illegitimate love child of Glory To Rome and some deck-builder. Does not flow as well as Glory To Rome, but still remarkable fun. Still I'll play this if I'm too tired/lazy to teach Glory to Rome.

Excluding Dominion this is only one deck-building game I realy like. Also significantly different from Dominion.

+ deck-building implemented in good way
+ not another Dominion
+ space theme

Man alive, this was a dull experience. This game is an efficiency engine for purists. If that floats your boat this might be fine, everyone else play race for the galaxy or something else instead. Many of the mechanics feel stripped down and derivative either from Race, or another San Juan clone, or deck builders.

I got to hand it to TMG - they make pretty games.

Eminent Domain is an interesting deckbuilder.  When you hear or see that word, chances are you think of Dominion-style games where you buy cards from a pool.  Most of the time you end up thinking, "Huh, I'd rather just play Dominion," or even, "Eh, I'm sick of deckbuilding entirely."  Fair enough, but take a look at this one.  It might not grab you by the yayas and pull you into its world - I think we're all past that point now, but ED has a neat take on the genre (at least I've not seen it before).

While you still build your deck by drawing from a common pool, the neat thing here is that you're not playing cards for currency and buying stuff up.  The common pool is simply all the types of actions that you can do, and that's it.  If you have some in your hand, you can play them for an action, but when you draw from the pool, you are basically doing action selection and then boosting that same action with similar cards from your hand.  Then, should a player wish to do so, they can follow your action out of turn at the cost of staring their own turn with a smaller hand, which typically isn't going to hurt too much since your hand probably sucks if you're going to follow.  Of course, there are benefits for leading the action on your turn, but otherwise it gives you an opportunity to get some stuff done before you get some stuff done... if that makes sense.

I liked it.  I don't know if it's something that I would play regularly, but I liked its twist of action-selection  blended with deckbuilding.  The unique cards are your research cards and planets you can "draft" into your tableau, but you'll have to settle them first before they can become useful to you (generally by providing icons; think free money here).

That being said, despite its unique outlook on the genre and its overall beautiful graphic design, I felt a bit of a lack of engagement.  I don't expect a lot of theme from a deckbuilder, but even still, I need a little bit of it to stay engaged.  Core Worlds, in contrast, is insanely meaty and feels like you're building an empire.  The Legendary series also play into their themes quite well.  Eminent Domain... felt like gaming cards and never took me out of the meta.

RATING: 6.5
I liked this game a lot the first time that I played it.  The second time, I was a bit sour on the same cards always being available.  May re-rate on future plays.  I'd like to try the expansion to see whether it keeps things fresh.

RATING: 8
Rated this 7.5 after trying the first game without the tech cards - a sure 8 after trying with the tech cards.
Was thinking that it was a 9, but then it suddenly ended just as I was building up.
Needless to say: I would like the game to be longer.

I really like that you get to do something on each other players turn - it is hardly any downtime at all.
The theme is also very well integrated into the mechanics.

And you really feel that you are expanding and building you're empire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Maybe I would be all over this game if it was the first time I played a game that claimed to have no downtime. The mechanic of attaching cards to an opponents action seems better suited for a game like Glory to Rome or Nightfall.  I didn't feel like it added anything to the gameplay of Eminent Domain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pleasantly surprised by this. It's definitely Glory to Rome + Race for the Galaxy + deckbuilding, but very enjoyable regardless.

Just as San Juan made RftG unnecessary for me, this may make SJ unnecessary.

Rating change to 4 (May  2016) from 8 (November 2011).

San Juan (second edition) is better than this, but I still don't feel the need to own that.

RATING: 3
Feels a lot like Glory to Rome with Sci-fi elements thrown in the mix. The cards look great and the research cards seem interesting, but the game doesn't seem to last long enough to make very good use of them. Ultimately without the research cards, this is a very basic game.

RATING: 6
2015-08-18 : First play and the game dragged on a bit as we were all unfamiliar with the possible strategies and just did a bit of everything which surely was sub-optimal. Well designed and good graphics and layout so will hit the table again soon enough so it may rise to an 8
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Obviously has inherited some genes from Dominion and some from Race for the Galaxy, but has challenges of its own. Well worth getting this in addition to the other two if you like both!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Let's look at aspects of the following:

Dominion: Deck building/thinning

Glory to Rome: Choosing roles and other players being able to follow that role or draw cards.  As well as boosting role actions.

Race for the Galaxy: Similar sci-fi theme and actions such as settling colonies, conquering worlds, and being able to produce goods and exchange them for VP

Eminent Domain is a combination of all of these games but yet feels like it's own unique thing.  On the complexity side, it's much closer to Dominion than Glory to Rome or Race for the Galaxy.  This sometimes leads to the game feeling fun to some or being considered tame/boring to others depending on where your tastes lie.  I have heard friends call London a relaxing game and I understand the sentiment but it feels too long to be relaxing.  I find Eminent Domain to be relaxing and relatively quick.  In fact, players should be wary that if multiple people are trying to use similar roles in the game the game will end very quickly almost to the point of being unsatisfying.  Overall, it's enjoyable and I will probably use it as a gateway to the more complex card games in my collection that I prefer.  I'm hoping the game holds up to repeated plays (at least long enough for an expansion to be released).

RATING: 1
Almost the worst deck building game.  It is slightly different, but feels very fidgety, and its one of those games that always makes you feel like your losing, even when your doing well.  It clearly lacks replayability, since the games vary so little from game to game, mostly due to the lack of stressers that would encourage a player to take one route or another.  You only get to make one of five actions, but realistically 4, since colonization and warfare conflict with each other, and its at least slightly detrimental to try doing both.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At first, it just seems like a mash-up of Dominion and Race For The Galaxy, but there's some uniqueness to the game, here to.  A good space themed deck builder that may have you thinking more than you expected to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I expect that it will have less replay than Dominion (but hey, I've been wrong before).  It does seem to have more depth to it than Dominion or any of the other games in its loose lineage.

I have to say - I really like it.  It's quick, but full of really interesting decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A San Juan style deckbuilder. What I mean by that is SJ is a little more nuanced than Race for the Galaxy. SJ's cards are a little less flashy, and a little less dynamic. It's not a bad thing, the game is just different. So, you see a lot less wacky, huge combos in Eminent Domain. That is interesting in its own. Deckbuilders don't particularly interest me, which explains my rating. For deckbuiders, I enjoy the tactical ones much more than the strategic ones. Think Ascension over Dominion. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
I've played this a couple dozen times, mostly two player, and am enjoying it a lot.  The follow/dissent mechanism works really well, and adds that bit of interaction that makes this way better than Dominion.  It still doesn't have quite as much interaction as I was hoping, but not too bad.

The game really works quite well; the different elements (flipping planets, researching, and selling goods for points) all integrate nicely, and provide a good amount of tension.  I really like the fact that thinning your deck (via the research action) is always an option.  It really scratches the deck-management itch.

Play time for us is a a little longer than reported, but it is worth it.

Overall, I like this game, and yet it doesn't quite have the touch of greatness it would need to become an 8.  Like most card games, it is short on elegance, and probably doesn't have huge depth (although we are still exploring that.  So far we are not tired of it, but I think that the luster will eventually fade.  It also does have a bit more luck than I like, particularly in the planet deck.  Also, as a minor irk, there are a few bits that seem "incomplete," as if it is just waiting for the next expansion.  I'm not a big expansion fan; I like complete games.  

But these are all minor points.  It's a good game.  7.5

2-8-2014  Not playing this quite as much anymore. The problem is that the significant luck factor in the planet draw makes me feel that it is a fairly light game, which I want to go by quickly, but the fact that there is a good amount to think about makes my wife feel that it is a serious strategy game that she should take her time with, and so drags it out a little too long for me.  But 

I still like the deck manipulation quite well

4-27-2016 We haven't played this for a couple of years, and I can't really see myself going back to it - it doesn't hold any interest. It was fun enough for a while, but apparently doesn't have lasting charm. Down to a 6.2 (cause it's still better than Dominion)

RATING: 5
Only one play so far.

*Update: Just can't get this one to the table. The theme is not popular. The game is a Role Selection/Deck Building hybrid with a little Tech Tree thrown in. I have San Juan for role selection, and I have Dominion for deck building. I don't really want to get rid of it, but when will anyone ever play it with me?

*Update: Traded for Flash Point. Another lovely game falls victim to the "Jones Theory." If I already have Glory to Rome, San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Dominion, then do I need Eminent Domain? No, no I do not.

I'm very much a fan of variety in my card games. I compared Eminent Domain to Race for the Galaxy and felt they were too similar. That was a mistake. Eminent Domain is a great deck building game that rewards the occasional repurposing of your deck.

Common images are a minor detractor. The gameplay is very solid. It is lighter, due to limited variety of cards, but a few major techs grant variety.

RATING: 5
The role selection part is not nearly as good as in [thing=28143]Race for the Galaxy[/thing] and the deckbuilding aspect is worse than in [thing=98351]Core Worlds[/thing].

What I mainly dislike about it is that for the most time you're filling up your deck with basic cards. This isn't much fun to me. When I play a deckbuilder, I want to toss out the basic cards and get more powerful new cards.

The expansion might fix some of the problems, but I don't like the game enough to get it.

RATING: 8
A fun, varied deck-builder.

RATING: N/A
The bottom line: "Eminent Domain is certainly indebted to its respected ancestors, such as Dominion, Race for the Galaxy, and Glory to Rome, and unmistakably bears their influence in its design, in terms of the deck-building and role-selection mechanics, and also the space theme that it shares with Race for the Galaxy. But this blend of mechanics and influences does result in a product that is quite different from anything we've seen before, and allows it to stand on its own despite being constructed on a foundation that is largely derivative. If you enjoy these other titles, there's a very good chance you'll love the card-play and dynamics of Eminent Domain enough for it to earn a place in your collection on the basis of its own merits."

Averaged score. Mel's a 9, Ruben's a 7, so ...

Mel: Simple game play once you can get through the rules explanation. Great choice for introducing folks to a deck builder. Only problem is that this is yet another game that's over before I feel like I've gotten into the groove of whatever scoring mechanic I've stumbled into. 

Ruben: I have a hard time pruning my deck, so I think one has to make a concerted effort at choosing how to build your deck.

1 play - 8: so far so good.  I like the Nightfall aspect.  I say NF rather than Glory to Rome because i like that you have very little idea of which lead will benefit opponents.  No Patron means most of your leeching is hidden information.

I can tell that this won't have the level of replayability nor interest for me that RftG does.  Still seems a lot more interesting to me than Dominion and such.

Don't like all the spaceship bits, especially the ginormous ones.  I like my card games with just cards, to maximize portability.


18 plays - 6: pretty much bored of this.  There's a good game in there somewhere, but something's missing.

RATING: 6
You play roles a la G2R but get a card of that role every time you do such that your deck begins to grow and possibly bloat. You produce and ship goods a la Race for the Galaxy and buy tech upgrades to give you bonus points and bonus powers. It all sounds really good on paper but somehow isn't as compelling in action. I mean it's OK but why choose this over either of the other two?

One of our favorite games. The ability to follow or dissent someone else's action keeps you constantly involved and your options constantly changing.

Played 1 time with 2 players for .5 hours.

Combine Race for the Galaxy + Dominion and then whittle the games down to a simpler structure, and you have Eminent Domain. It's a decent game. Worth two plays, but I'd rather play either Dominion or RftG.

New Years day.  This is my first new game played in 2012.  

Another deck building game, but another good one.  I guess I am not tired of them yet.  

This is one of the easier to play deck building games.  Even though it is not complex, the combination of familiar mechanics creates a new strategy platform.  This game is not interactive, yet paying sharp attention to how an opponent is playing is vitally important.  

The interesting mechanic that makes this game unique, is that the more you do a particular role, the better it becomes.  However, at some point it can choke your hand, and also end the game very fast.  Like other deck building games, thinning the deck can be a key to winning.

There are strong similarities to the Client mechanic in Glory to Rome.  If your hand does get choked with one type of card, many actions that you could share with your opponents are lost.  Like Race for the Galaxy, the planets on your tableau can produce one resource which can be exchanged for V.P.'s.  Like Dominion, there are some stacks of cards which are all the same and when a certain number is gone, signals the end of the game.  And the start deck is the same for everyone, as it is with many of the deck building games.

Components:  The plastic fighters are great looking, but there seems to be no reason for the very different sizes and shapes.  Will this be addressed in some expansion?  The cards are of very poor quality--before the first game finished some of the corners showed wear--I sleeved immediately.  In contrast, the start planets are thick cardboard with a nice finish.  I'm not sure why they are so different from the rest of the cards.  The game is visually attractive.  The rules are nicely written, but a clear explanation of how the symbols on the tech cards are used is sadly lacking.

Despite my displeasure with the horrible card quality, and my lack of understanding some of the components' design logic, I really enjoy the play.  I am looking forward to testing different strategies.

I preordered the game but traded it due to having too many card games.

The interaction is quite nice, I like the "use improves" concept, and I like the way you can either conquer or settle the planets.

However there are rough edges to the game: the planetary resources are undifferentiated, except for 3 technologies, and you kind of want to focus on a single planet type.

Ordered via Kickstarter.  I really like this game.  Its like a lighter, easier to understand Race for the Galaxy in terms of theme and superficial structure/mechanics.  But it is really its own semi-deck builder that is difficult to master and that rewards repeated play.  The two-player game is outstanding.  The three player extended game is very good.

But... the four player game is simply too short.  The game ends just as we are getting our respective "victory engines" cranked up.

I know the experts tell us that this is simply because we are not playing optimally (in other words too many of us are grabbing all the research/colonize cards and not enough of us are doing the warfare approach), but that isn't what makes a game great.  It shouldn't require four experts to play perfectly for it to shine.   That said, I'd play any time whether with 2, 3 or 4.  I can't wait for the expansion.

Very fun game that is much easier to set up and play than other deck-builders, yet remains tough to master.  I love it with 2 players and 3 players and like it with 4.

Egy játék után még kavarognak bennem a gondolatok, így nem tudok végleges ítéletet hozni.
Egy biztos: elég sok hatás fedezhető fel a játékban, ám mégis van benne egy olyan új alapmechanizmus, ami miatt jelentősen megváltozik a játékmenet. Viszont vannak benne furcsaságok is sajnos. Az illusztráció szép, de ha már ennyire lekoppintották a race for the galaxyt, akkor nem értott volna egyedibb bolygókat csinálni, mind névben, mind grafikában, mind képességekben. Jópár utat végig lehet próbálgatni a játékban, de alapvetően kérdésesnek érzem az újrajátszatóságot, mert bolygók közt szinte nincs különbség. A 4 féle termény meg teljesen értelmetlen, ha szinte nincs semmilyen kártya, amivel számítana.

RATING: 6
When playing Eminent Domain for the first time, comparisons to Race for the Galaxy, Dominion, and Glory to Rome are inevitable. In fact, you can mostly explain the game in terms of those three, although it does simplify the core concepts of each.

Maybe it's because of this that I would brand the game as a beginners' RftG or GtR (Dominion not so much, since the deck-building aspect is much less prominent), introducing many of the core concepts but in a more forgiving environment. The number of available options is fairly small, the combo building part is rather tame, and the action leeching is much less severe without becoming unimportant.

All this simplification comes for a price, of course. The cards, including actions, roles, developments, and planets, are all very generic and provide very little in the way of flavour or character. While I wouldn't go so far as to say the game has no soul, it does smell of clean-room engineering very strongly. I'm also somewhat unsure of the long-term appeal since there is so little variability. I'm sure you will be able to further refine strategies for a while but I expect those to be very small incremental steps without much of a feeling of discovery or improvement.

RATING: 9.5
Great deck-builder. The buildup of role cards is a great mechanic, and trashing is often the difference between winning and losing.

I think an expansion with more tech cards (allowing you to pick a random set of techs) would greatly help this game, as there is nothing stopping you from running the same strategy every single time.

What could have been? Many great cogs in this machine, but at its heart a giant stack of tech cards you need to traverse to play. This is so much of a dealbreaker I will never teach anyone this game.

After one play, I really like this game.  I like it just as much, but in exactly the same way, that I like Race for the Galaxy.  Since it takes longer to play, the only reason I can think of to play this instead of Race is just for a change of pace.  A good game in its own right, but for me not good enough to replace a well-established direct competitor.

Hand Management, Role selection, Card Drafting and Deck building are mechanics that I enjoy. I can't put my finger on why I don't like this game more.

Box is sturdy enough. Tiles are of good quality. Glossy rulebook is nice.  Wish the cards were a bit more textured and durable The cards will likely need sleeving. A few parts started to break off the plastic ships - bummer.

Military/Colonize strategy is straightforward and appears powerful. Need to explore more subtle strategies involving tech and trading.

Own: Bonus Planets (present in copy I purchased)


This is a very fun, next-gen deckbuilder where your deck more reflects your amount of specialization rather than just action cards and stuff like that. 

It's very much like if you were playing San Juan, but every time you were Builder you got a little bit better at being the Builder.

Plus the dual nature of the cards (Action/Role) is very clever; the interaction comes with "Following" an opponent's roles and playing your role selection in a way that he can't or won't benefit.

Though what makes the game are the cool Research/tech cards.  Those are fun to use, especially when you ramp up your tech curve.

[i]Super Awesome 2014 Birthday Gift from Jen!![/i]

Eminent Domain fortunately lived up to my expectations: a very solid deck builder that does something different. Dominion is all about a variety of cards that come into the hand while Thunderstone just takes Dominion to the next level. ED flips the mechanic of its head. Players now work to specialize in action/role cards in order to maximize particular choices. Of course, balancing these cards is key; but also important is when to begin specializing in one or two types. As well, players must keep in mind how their turns might help out their opponents through the "follow" mechanics (an excellent and defining part of this game). Very streamlined rules and and awesome components. Each planet or technology offers just a couple of extra things to make the game rich without feeling bloated. I can only imagine this gets better with the expansion. When it comes to deck builders, ED might be the classiest of them all. I still prefer Dominon for the sheer variety and Thunderstone for the powerful theme and perfect saturation of mechanics; but ED is definitely on my list of smart deck builders that I'm happy to have in my collection.

All games played now include the 'Escalation' and 'Bonus Planets' expansions.

Race for the Galaxy as a deck building game - some  interesting card play and card engine actions but with not as good art (as rftg) and equally little player interaction. Another iteration of deck building games but with some better deck slimming mechanics and therefore quicker play. The range of available cards is quite small for the base game so needs an expansion to maintain replayability. Ok game with average components and nothing new.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If this isn't a deckbuilding version of Race for the Galaxy, I don't know what is. I can't help but compare. The ability to stack your own action deck in ED removes some of the randomness found in the single-pile draw performed on the static RftG deck. Yet, the choices here are simpler. The challenge here seems to best your opponent, not to achieve your personal best.

Eminent Domain is a little bit better than I expected it to be, but ultimately it doesn't measure up to its competitors. It's a very close relative of some outstanding games like Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome, and Dominion. I did enjoy my first play of Eminent Domain, but I can't imagine a situation in which I would choose to play it over those other games. It's just too generic, too flavorless, too patterned, and too limited in scope.

The most interesting part of Eminent Domain is the way that a new "basic" card enters your deck every turn, matching the role that you choose. You have a lot of control over what cards you will be drawing in this game, and your deck cycles very quickly. Managing your deck composition, so that you're drawing the hands you need, is very enjoyable. You have to know what's in your deck. Even one card more of less of a certain type can make a gigantic difference.

I would play Eminent Domain again if asked, but would not request it.

Feels like a deckbuilding mashup of Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy. The result is weaker than both.

If you don't use a research strategy, the game can feel very dull.  RftG wins for providing a more interesting tableau building experience. GtR wins for providing a more interesting lead/follow card game by making the cards multi-use for buildings, resources and roles. 

People love ED, but whenever I play, I spend all my time wishing I was playing either of the other two.

RATING: 7
This is another deck-building game with more emphasis on deck balance, but is as much a role se-lection game. When I played it I had a good time playing it, as it seemed to go smoothly and it didn’t take much time to get into the game.

That said I have a few problems with the game. You will refine your deck, but there is no sense of change in direction, hence it feels the same during the game. You focus on your strategy and go with it. There are seldom opportunities to have and set up super turns, which create memorable ex-periences and there is surprisingly little interaction considering it seem to share legacy from Glory to Rome.

RATING: 7
This is a good game just not one for us. The interaction is indirect (follow or dissent) and I feel like to get the best out of the game you really need to invest more time than we have. Get to know the tech cards (and how they impact your strategy) and really pay attention to what the other player is doing.

Our preferred deck-builder is Star Realms, much more pick up and play, in your face interaction, quick build-up and big combos. So maybe that explains why we found EmDo good, but a little dull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A solid mix of deckbuilding and role selection (Dominion & San Juan but with space theme). As the roles would not offer enough actions, you have a dual use of your cards with an extra action on the role cards. Of course those actions are reminiscent to the options of the roles. Sadly there is no interaction between players and the cards you may add to your deck are bland.

Deckbuilders with no variable setup are a hard sell for me. This has another strike against it because producing and selling goods for victory points is deadly boring.

I played this a lot when I first got into board gaming. I have barely played it for a year or more now. I think I just have games with more interesting mechanics now.

I was always disappointed with the way planets are just surveyed and then colonised, with no interaction with the enemy empires. Space Empires 4X has since entered my life and taken care of my space building needs, anyway.

I don't think Eminent Domain is broken in any way, but it does feel quite flat and not particularly exciting.

This game is really growing on me.  
It works as a nice blend between Race for the Galaxy and Dominion, though it's dissimilar enough that it's very much worth adding to the collection.  There seems to be plenty of strategy tucked in to the technology cards, though I wouldn't be surprised to find out players who've won without touching them too, which speaks of the quality of the game.
And though a more experienced player will almost definitely trounce a novice, it's not like RftG where knowledge is king and knowing every card in the deck is a must for deeper strategy.  ED includes a chart of all its tech cards on the back of the rulebook, so with a quick glance your options are known to you.  Who knew the deck building mechanic could work in so many formats?

Great deck building space exploration/exploitation card game.  Scratches the same itch as Race for the Galaxy without making me feel I need a math degree to win.  After a few plays, I'm starting to see that there may be a metagame way to win every time, just like in Dominion, but if you stay away from that type of player and keep it light, it is quite fun.  It's also cool to see "emptying a stack to end the game" as having more strategy depth than just as a timer for the game.  Would like to see rules for using warfare to attack other players and we may make our own house rule to allow for that as warfare seems a weaker overall strategy than colonizing, especially since you get one less Warfare card to begin with.  Game is fun without feeling the need to "thin" your deck all the time as the starting cards are as powerful as all but a few cards that you will add to your starting deck.  The addition of a "Political" card that allows you to trade it in for anything else allows you to pick a particular strategy to give an early boost to. Kinda disappointed to hear of a sequel as I don't see how it will help the game and might unnecessarily complicate the game (I'm looking at you 7 Wonders Leaders!).  Could use a way to attack other players though to make Warfare a more viable part of the game, thought.  Highly recommend to any light gamers, especially those that enjoy other deckbuilders.

Excellent blend of deck building, role selection and technology research mechanisms. Plus it has a well fit sci-fi empire building theme. Like Race for the Galaxy (basic version) and San Juan, there is limited ability to damage an opponent's position. Victory is by choosing a strategy that will more effectively produce points before the game ends, all too soon...

So, do I enjoy the game?  Yes … but I am not enthralled.  It is fun and has some challenges, but it is not terribly deep.  There are more choices to be made and greater challenges in all of the three games that seem to have influenced its design:  Dominion, Puerto Rico and Race with the Galaxy.  It is difficult not to compare a game to other games, particularly if they share similar characteristics and/or mechanisms.  If I had never played those three games I might be enamored by Eminent Domain.  However, I have played all three of those games, and prefer two of the three.  

Still, Eminent Domain is entertaining, light game that can be played quickly.  Further, since it is not complicated, it is suitable as a vehicle to introduce folks to our hobby.  There is no direct interaction or aggression.  Each player can play their own game without interference from their opponents.  These are all traits that help make it appealing to folks new to the hobby or folks who do not enjoy player conflict.  Reaction from others will likely be mixed.

Nothing too wrong with it, but nothing really good, either. With only half a dozen cards from which to choose, the deck building is quite dull. And on the rest, the game simply does nothing that "Race for the Galaxy" doesn't do better. The various resources are functionally the same, and I'm not sure the strategies are well balanced. The lack of variety in the illustration of the planets also detracts from the experience.

RATING: 5
This was a solid game but I was a little disappointed. There is less interaction than base set Dominion.  Yes, you read that correctly.  ED is basically a hodge podge of mechanics, and plays a little bit like dominion with glory to rome's roles grafted on.  (I haven't played Race for the galaxy but others compared it to that game too).

Much of the variability and interesting stuff in the game comes from the technology cards, so if you don't start building technology early you can still win but the game is not nearly as interesting.  I built a strong trade economy and was doing well with military conquests of planets but almost completely ignored technology.  I did not win, but did pretty well.  Downside was, I barely used all the neat variable technology cards.  The upgrade cards would be a lot more interesting if technology was not the only possible way to get them.  

The only interaction in the game comes from piggy-backing on other people's role choices.  Sometimes you didn't take a role because you knew no one had taken it in a while and much of the table would benefit.  Other times you intentionally took a role because you knew someone had just done it and few would benefit.  For me, this was not enough interaction.  This game could very easily be converted into a solo game, and other than a few instances where role selection was effected by what had happened before, it was a solo game. 

The game also feels very repetitive.  You do the exact same thing every turn, and your best play is usually dictated by the cards in your hand.  Much like dominion, the best play each turn is brainless and obvious, based solely on what cards you drew- that part of the game almost plays itself.  The real strategy in ED (like dominion) is in what stuff you get to add to your deck and build your chances of drawing a killer hand.  This is not my favorite type of game, but clearly with the popularity of dominion and many clones, I am in the minority.  I enjoy these sort of games but will never clamor to play them because at the end of the day it just isn't enough interesting choices for the time it takes to play.  

The art, cards, and everything else look great.  Game just isn't my cup of tea.  I wouldn't mind playing it a second time to make sure I'm not selling it short.

RATING: 7
This game contains elements of Race for the Galaxy (pick one of 5 roles, including colonize or attack a planet), Glory To Rome (follow the leader or draw a card), and Dominion (deck building).  Luckily, it's much simpler than Race for the Galaxy, because most of the action cards in the deck are the same, until later when you research better cards.  There are lots of planets, but they don't differ that much from each other, unlike planets in Race.

One neat improvement over Dominion is that you can choose to keep a card in hand at the end of your turn rather than being forced to discard all unused cards.  This does make the game take a little longer, I think, but it removes some of the randomness and brings in some strategy.  I also like that this is not as vicious as some other games -- no attacking of others, as far as I can tell, and the only common resources that we're really fighting over are research cards, and perhaps planet cards.

There is lots of other strategy required, of course!  After one play, I could see that, but I don't have a good idea of how to put it all together.  Clearly, getting lots of military cards is one strategy.  Colonizing and then using produce and trade is another strategy.  Getting research cards (especially 7-beaker ones that are worth 5 points each) is another.  Combinations of these can definitely work.  And getting planets that further your strategy, or give you diversity (perhaps allowing you to follow a leader without spending a card) is a good helper.

Definitely want to play this more.

RATING: 6
Fresh take on proven mechanics found in other games that results in something new and its own. Gameplay is based on simple, subtle, but powerful decisions. There's a lot of play in the wheel, and it's easy to over-steer. Artwork is tops, production so-so. Thematic satisfaction comes in sporadic doses.

Have found strategy elusive. Suspect that rating will increase with more play and a better grasp of how to steer the thing.

The role selection in this game is fantastic. You really have to look at what other people are doing to stay on top. 

The four player game feels a little short in comparison to the extended three player and two player games and requires an adjustment in play to account for this. It is still fun but ends just as you feel like you are getting going. 

All in all this is a really great game. It is fast and fun and you often get to make a decision on another players turn.

Forgettable. Imagine a deck-building game but with much of the variety removed. I could see this improving slightly with familiarity but then I don't really care if I ever play again.

===

A couple years later, I played it a second time. On one hand, my previous comments seem a bit harsh. On the other hand, I had pretty much forgotten the game. At a second glance, I notice that it is more of a deck-builder/role-selection hybrid. The role you pick determines your deck contents but also allows everyone to act, as in Puerto Rico. I'm still not very excited about the game but it has its merits.

The more I play this game, the more limited the number of strategies feel. This can change based on your starting planet and strategies of your opponents, but I feel the lack of random elements in the game hinder its long term appeal.

I've played it about 10 times now and I feel like I'm basically iterating on the same strategy. It's a solid game and quite fun, I just feel it needs a little variance.

An interesting approach to deck building that combines elements of Dominion, San Juan, Glory to Rome, and Race for the Galaxy. There are five "common" cards that define actions and roles like GtR. You play a card from your hand to specify an action that you alone execute, which may be to draw more cards, get more fighters/attack a planet, colonize a planet, trade a resource, or trash cards (like the Chapel in Dominion). Then you select a card from one of the stacks of the five common cards to define a role, which allows you do more stuff, like survey new planets, conquer new planets, complete colonization of new planets, generate resources/trade on those planets (similar to craftsman/trading in San Juan), or conduct research which allows selection of more powerful and flexible cards (sort of like buying kingdom cards in Dominion, but there is no money in ED--you have to have the correct type of planets and X number of research cards). Like GtR/RftG, others can follow suit (like in GtR, but at a disadvantage) or draw one card ("Thinking" in GtR). Eventually, decks become specialized towards conquering or colonizing planets, which have VP values. But through research, the character of the decks could get substantially altered without much penalty.

Although it is not as sophisticated as Dominion in card play, there is plenty to like here, but admittedly it will take several plays for me to "get it". I haven't played Ascension or Thunderstone, but I hear this is a touch meatier than those two. There is no player interaction, except for maybe the following the role of the leader. Decks can be tailored for specific strategies, and the planets (one of the sources of VP) do not clog up the deck like in Dominion! The game conveys a similar feeling to RftG, but in a much smoother, straight-forward fashion that plays more quickly. Plus, there are less confusing icons and symbology to comprehend. My initial rating is an '8'. I'd up for another play very soon.

Update (12/29/11) 4+ plays: It's a pretty enjoyable game, but not enough for me to want to get my own copy. The game seems to end 15-20 minutes too early, and leaves me dissatisfied, kind of like Chicago Express. It's more than a filler, but ends too soon. Some of my friends think it is "just right". I'd like several more turns to fully develop my planets.

Update (12/30/11) 5+ plays: Playing twice in one night is too much; two different strategies were tried, but the game ended before either panned out. Again, the game leaves me dissatisfied. Getting dissatisfied twice in one evening is too much. Down to a '7'.

Update (05/18/12) 7 plays: I finally "get it", by managing to win twice with getting 3x advanced planets and getting one or two 7x research permanents. Understanding the tech cards seems to be the key in doing well. I'm still wary to get my own copy, but will happily suggest playing it. Still a '7' for now.

A cute game that I like more than I'd like to, given my general disdain for its publisher. But it's a workable mashup of Dominion and Glory to Rome, two of my favorite games. It's not at all the Future of Deckbuilding as the hype would have you believe (a claim that sounds even more ridiculous in the wake of A Few Acres of Snow, which genuinely takes deckbuilding to a new place), but it's solid enough.

RATING: 7.5
A solid deck-builder in a sea of deck builders. Sadly "solid" deck builders are a dime a dozen nowadays with terrible ones showing up even more. The game is different though than most because you're trying to build your empire with clever play of 5 main cards: Survey, Warfare, Colonize, Produce/Trade, & Research. Honestly EmDo is more on par with Race for the Galaxy, but with a deck building mechanic.

All players start with similar hands(unless playing with the expansion, more details below) and add their decks not by buying cards but when you play a card, you grab another card of the same action to not only add to your deck, but to add to your action. Also what I like is that your opponents can play the same action and benefit, albeit not as strong as the person who leads, or dissent, which allows them to draw. This eliminates solitaire turns which Dominion suffers from.

The main beef I had with the main game is that it wears thin, after only a few plays, since there isn't enough different cards to research or variety in planets. This of course is made better with the escalation expansion, which brings the game up to an 8.5. One thing I hate though is MANDATORY expansions that must be purchased to enjoy a game. Not because the expansion is great and the base game is great(think Legendary and Dark City) but when it's needed to make the game what it should have been from the get-go. The expansion makes the game that much better and varied and allows for many different paths to victory which the base game severely suffered from. 

If you own EmDo, or plan to buy it, purchase it with the expansion, without question. It turns Eminent Domain from a solid game, to a great game. Exotica is also another expansion I'd like to try, but I do not recommend that one as a day one purchase, like Escalation. You're hurting yourself not playing with the expansion

For me, this will always be the poster child for the Kickstarter era. It's highly derivative (Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy, Dominion), the planets and technologies are bland, the balance between the different roles is poor. In other words this is nowhere near as good as the games from which it borrows and in the publisher era it would never have seen the light of day, yet thanks to Kickstarter we're landed with it anyway. I despair.

Meh. I dunno, I like for my card-combo games to have cards that are better differentiated from each other and do fun things.

Some interesting stuff in here, but somehow it's just not all that terribly interesting. It's probably the stiff competition it's got. I'd just always rather play one of the several games that clearly inspired it.

--update 12/2/2011--
Ok, I take it back. This has been a bit of a roller coaster game for me. After I read the rules, I thought it sounded really awesome. My first game was a little underwhelming, and my second game had me ready to trade the game away. I played a couple more just to give it a fair shake, and now after my fourth game, I've put the rating up to a pretty respectable 7. With more plays, I think it might go up even further. Cool stuff.

--update 6/7/2012--
Ok, I untake it back. I nobody really liked it all that much, and though I think I could have gotten about 5 more plays out of it before it got boring, I saw no reason to wait. Traded in a math trade for Core Worlds.

Well, it was okay.  I just didn't find the "fun".  My deck wasn't interesting to me.  It just had a mix of the 5 role cards.  Sure, there were a few technology cards, but they were hardly different at all.  I never got to draw my "fun" cards ala Dominion/Ascension/RftG.

The rest of the game didn't make up for that.  The planets again were just too similar.  Not enough exciting variance.

Then the actual role selection was a little too obvious in places.  The long term impact on your deck was the only interesting outcome to me.

Got it from Kickstarter, and while it is mechanically sound, it just didn't grab me at all.  I found it bland and a simple deck building exercise.  While I did like the fact that taking an action specialized your deck in that direction for the future, making you more efficient, it also made it difficult to change gears afterward.  The basic role cards were also quite bland, not really grabbing me.

Not a bad game by itself, it just wasn't a game for me.

RATING: 7
It's the deckbuilding of Dominion meets the role selection and tableau building of Race For The Galaxy - an odd combination for me because I love the former and dislike the latter.

I do enjoy this game as it fixes some of the issues with Race (namely the learning curve and that leaching off other players' actions is nowhere near as critical), but it does carry over some of its problems (particularly in how knowing the cards that can be researched can be a particular advantage).

Overall, it's a fun mash-up of two types of games that I'm happy to play.

I've heard several people describe this as a cross between Dominion and Race for the Galaxy.  It has some interesting mechanics.  Somehow, though, it went from "you can only play it if you talk to the guy who got it from Essen" to "everybody has overplayed it so it doesn't come out any more" without my actually getting to play it more than a few times.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2013)

I had huge expectations for the game, after playing it, the verdict is, it is a good game. I love the theme but I didn’t feel it when I played the game. It’s like a mix between Dominion and Glory to Rome with some RFTG added for good measure. The game art is ok and the game components are of good quality. The gameplay offers some interesting decisions (I follow?, I keep some cards at the end, which role do I play?), in particular I like the role mechanic a la Glory to Rome.

I think this is best played with 2 player or 3 fast players, more than that and I begin to feel the hated downtime. I don’t understand the name of the game very well, perhaps because English is not my first language?

I want to play it again, but for now I won’t buy it. RFTG, Dominion and GtR are superior games IMO,  I don’t think this has a lot of replayability because it seems there are too few cards making each game too similar. I have to play more to see if this is true.

It´s been years since I last played Eminent Domain. I must say that I had much more fun this time than the first one. Now, I appreciate its design a bit more. 

The decisions need to play the game aren’t very complex, but they aren’t very obvious either. When you play the game, you need to specialize and the more you do a role the better you become at it. 

Eminent Domain plays very fast, in fact the when the game ends you wish you had a little more rounds to develop your strategy. 

The luck factor isn’t very high, it is only present with the planets and the more you explore, the more you can control it.

I still prefer to play RFTG or Glory to Rome over it, but I enjoy it.
 
Bottom line, I enjoy playing Eminent Domain, for now it is a borderline 7.0 to me. I already bought all its expansions and want to try them soon.

Wasn't sure I'd like this one.  It's got deckbuilding so I certainly had my doubts, but it turns out Eminent Domain scratches an itch I didn't know I had.  It's also the first real sci-fi game in my collection.  That was long over-due.

Tasty Minstrel Games is 3 for 3 with me.  This would be a 10 if the player interaction was somehow upped just a little.

Also, this is one of those games that always sparks a post game strategy discussion and we always come up with different things to try for the next game.

UPDATE: November 2012:  the solitude of this game is starting to bug me more.  Not as enthusiastic about it as I once was.  I find the decks just don't build that differently.  If I had one person that I played this with often I think I could really enjoy that, but as it is it only comes off the shelf every so often and being only kinda familiar with it from game to game causes a lot of unremarkable sessions.

Initial feel is that it's an efficiency game at core - make the best use of your turns and in particular piggybacking on others' turns to build points as efficiently as possible.

I had a real tough time with the ruleset on this game...not really sure why.  I haven't read the rules yet but the initial explanation seemed more than adequate.

I would reservedly say that I liked it. I would play again, and want to try a four player game.

The problem as I see it is that some of the paths to victory take time to develop, if more than one of the players employ the same strategy the game just flies by, not allowing that development time.

I am not sure this game has the replayability factor I like.

I guess we'll see.  

Other factors limit my enjoyment, also.  The game definitely does not live up to the hype.  In addition, I kickstarted and the constant problems and delays have soured me on both this game and Tasty Minstrel in general.

After initial plays - comes off as a better game with less luck than Race for the Galaxy.  Looking forward to getting it to the table more.  Afraid it might get stale after a few dozen plays without an expansion.  Not sure what a meaningful expansion would add, tho.

Less stale than a perfect information role selection game like PR, tho.

After many plays - great game.  Has not gotten stale at all.  'Obvious' strategies found after a few play are not nearly as powerful when you get to know it.  Lots of options in the game.  Still have many techs that have not been purchased suggesting that there is still a lot of space to explore.

Eminent Domain does itself a disservice by blatantly copying the core ideas from Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome and Dominion. I was constantly asking myself why I wasn't playing RFTG instead which is both quicker and deeper. Dominion, not so much as I'm no fan of deckbuilders.
Considered on its own merits, Eminent Domain works and provides some strategic challenge of building up your deck. But as there's no variation in startup, I doubt its longevity. A few generic strategies will prove strong, produce/trade is a prime contender for being inferior. Interplay variety stems from the player interactions with leeching on the actions of other players being a prominent feature.

I enjoyed my first three games -- it's a nice twist on the deck building / role selection / tableau mechanic (e.g. a mix of Puerto Rico, Race for the Galaxy, and Dominion).

I often tell people this game feels like Race for the Galaxy lite... and then am told they absolutely do NOT agree. However, you are basically doing both a little deck building and a little tablou building in a role-selection game. That is very similar to Race at its core. 

I obviously love both Race and Eminent Domain... but might recommend this game over Race because it is easier to teach and play. Race/Roll for the Galaxy are amazing games, but they look scary and Race doesn't have great table presence. This game will be a lot easier sell to people who have never played either. Move "up" to Race/Roll later - although with expansion content available this game definitely has legs to last a long time.

A definite disappointment.  I really wanted to like this one, but I'm just not seeing enough variation in the game play to keep breaking it out.

I'm starting to tire of games with a heavy-handed BGG presence.  Tasty Minstrel Games is one of the worst offenders, since the publisher and designer of most of its games seem to be sure to jump in on just about anything said about their products.  I know that many like this, but to me it smothers unbridled discussion of the games.

Chris Farrell pretty much captured my thoughts exactly and expressed them in a much more coherent way.  I'm not a big fan of Kickstarter as a method of making games available and hope that it doesn't become standard.

This is a hard game to judge because its a combination of so many games. There is a good game in there, but its layered by unnecessary complexity and a blandness of mechanics.

An okay deckbuilding game.  Not sure what to say about it.  I liked it but didn't love it.  I want to play it more but that's really only to finalize my opinion of the game.  I'm predicting that it will always just be okay and that's it.  Would rather play Trains I think.  But would gladly play this before Dominion.

Odd decision to make the ship tokens different sizes but each the same value.  Would have preferred they all be the same size (big or little, doesn't matter).

This game just doesn't stack up to the competition of Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome.  In many ways, Eminent Domain feels scripted.  There are only so many things you can do out of order.  Also, you end up seeing the same cards in your hand over and over again.  I found it tedious and fairly dull, although the game is pretty.

I owned this, then traded it, and have since played with some more experienced players and found it a bit more interesting and worth exploring further. Oops. I really like that the engine has "inertia" and part of the game is managing that. On the other hand, there are rarely large score differentials at the end (first and last are usually within 3-4 points of each other) and I think the pacing is a little off; it's a bit too easy for groupthink, or just chance in planet draws, to end the game early by causing a blitz on a particular pile (or two). These two combine to make it the game winner frustratingly arbitrary sometimes.

I suspect playing the game with a public scoring track might improve this aspect significantly by making it clear to some players that they really shouldn't be helping the game to end; it's hard to keep track when scores are so close, so it's hard to tell what your incentives are. But certainly interested to play it a bit more, as long as I can find someone who still has it!

Two plays deep and not 100% sure what I think so far.  It seems like there is a ton of game here but I have yet to figure it out.  Also I dont see much replay value, as the cards will be very simular every game, so once you get the winning strategy it should work everytime. 

4 or 5 plays in now.  I get better with each play and I am really enjoying exploring the different strategies.

I enjoy deckbuilding games. As I've mentioned, my favorite is Legendary, but this game has just enough difference to be a staple in my collection. ]

This game is different in the sense that it isn't cooperative and is seemingly more simplistic. However, there is a lot of strategy to this game, especially with the follow and dissent aspects of the game. If a player takes a role of colonization, everyone else can 'follow' and colonize as well, which opens up advantages for the next turn. OR they can dissent and draw an extra card for their next turn, which is also a great advantage.

The only complaint I have for this game is that once you play it three or so times in a sitting it gets a little stale. This is because the cards and strategies may be the same for each game, whereas in a game like Legendary the objective, characters, and villians change. My solution is to put it down and play it again a month or so later.

Comments after a few plays. EmDo by itself is good, accessible and offers interesting choices. I've played many games of Race for the Galaxy, and many more games of Roll for the Galaxy, but EmDo offers me a feeling of control that is lacking from both those games. The iconography is also much, much more accessible. I've played the base game with my wife and daughter as a family game, and that worked well. I've also played with the Escalation expansion with my gaming friends, and it was a hit there, also. It is surprisingly "thinky" for a deck-builder.

There is a lot to love about EmDo, and I've backed the Exotica expansion, as well. I am concerned that some of the Escalation technologies and scenarios are overpowered, or at least unbalanced. However, even if we continue to find that this is the case, I would rather leave them in the box and keep playing this excellent game.

My favourite deck building game. With both expansions it is a masterpiece that's gotten a little too grand unfortunately.

Wow, a 4?  I'm looking back at my ratings here and I didn't think I disliked this game THAT much.  In fact, I got the Escalation expansion on Kickstarter!  haha  I don't even have the base yet!  And I rated it a 4!  It looked like the expansion would solve some of the things I don't like about this base game though.  Which can be summed up as such: it feels like DoMiNiOn PLUS!!! with no oomph.  We'll see how the expansion goes...

06-12-2013 - Played it last night in a more comfortable setting: at home, all newbs, no rush or fuss.  We had a really good time with it and I've bumped it up to a 7.  It's not Dominion+, and perhaps the fact that I approached it that way is why I gave it such a low score.  It is it's own thing for sure.  Can't wait for the expansion now!!!

[b]Long Version[/b]: read my review of EmDo here for my thoughts on what makes it tick.

[thread=700204][/thread]

Update: I'm finally able to put into words one of the things I really like about this design.  The point scoring is largely incremental, meaning you will generally gain a few points at a time.  There will not often be huge turns where you do so much that you vault out to a huge lead.  This game rewards consistent efficiency rather than a couple big moves and that's a focus I really appreciate, especially in a deck building format.

Sad to give this game a 5, but it just seems unfinished to me. I haven't gotten to play the expansions, but I expect they will bump it up to a 7. I have to wonder why publishers strip out important game content and call it "expansions". (2011 Civilization, I'm looking at you.)

Picked up at GenCon. We got in one play, and I'll play more to see how it goes. The leader-follow system does a lot to break the solitaire-feel of Dominion, since at any time you're hoping your opponents will take the action you need and save you some time.

It looks like there are a lot of different strategies, but since all cards are in play every game, is a master strategy possible? It's not apparent after one game at least. Unlike Dominion, small-scale choices like when to play a card are more important than large-scale ones (such as what to buy).

I think more variants and expansions will make this a solid and strategic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My first deck building game, pick this over Dominion because of the theme and cool mechanics. The game is neatly designed, though you must have the Bonus Planets expansion to enjoy it fully. I still feel Warfare is a bit imbalanced, but not so much that it breaks the game. Looking forward to Escalation expansion.

---

Update 20/9/2014: More plays in with 3+ players and a few problems arose. It's somewhat hard to keep track of what everyone's doing, though maybe it's not the game's fault and more likely my inability to follow the actions of other players. Also I found that for a deck building game, the mechanic that lets you keep a certain amount of cards before discarding/drawing is really clunky. There are also some problems that I don't like that inherently belong to deck building games, like it's really awkward to shuffle your deck when it has 5 cards or less, or when people make honest mistakes and overdraw.. Afterall, the 2-player game is elegant and interesting, but more than that is a bit chaotic to me.

Previously owned the bonus planets promo as well as Escalation expansion. Must have for the game if you like it imo.

RATING: N/A
Eminent Domain is a civilization-building game in which your civilization's abilities are based on a deck of Role cards. At the beginning of the game each player has the same deck of cards, with just two cards for each Role in it. Every turn you must choose a Role to execute (and like Glory to Rome or Puerto Rico, your opponents will get a chance to follow suit), and in doing so you will add one of those Role cards to your deck. When executing a Role, you can boost its effect by playing cards out of your hand matching the Role you have chosen. For example, the more you Research, the better you get at Researching (because you'll have more Research cards in your deck).

LIKES:

* I like the concept of building your deck via picking the action and picking up the card as well as the opportunity for others to follow on a role.
* Game is fairly straightforward to learn and play although it will take a couple plays to play well.

DISLIKE:

* I have some concerns that once everyone knows what they are doing, the game may come down to who had the best luck of the draw for the planets or such.  I realize there are a couple other methods to points (tech/goods).  Time will tell.
* Uncertain if there is much variety to paths to victory.  I wonder if the the deciding point for the victor is possibly who chose the best secondary path to points?  

===================

All that being said, I know I took a while to warm up to Race for the Galaxy so we'll see if the same result happens here.

The action one person selects can the be used by the other players, Planets can be colonized or conquered, you can produce goods on planets, which you can then sell for VP.

We really enjoy [thing=28143][/thing] and [thing=19857][/thing], so we were interested in [thing=68425][/thing] when we first heard about it.  This was the first time we had heard about the whole Kickstarter process, but we decided to go in and help fund the game.  We hadn't really liked [thing=36218][/thing], but this sounded like a deck building game we might enjoy.

When it finally came in, we gave it a shot.  It was...anticlimactic.  The theme and many of the actions are taken from Race, while the role selection mechanism is lifted from Glory.  Unfortunately, it kept the boredom of Dominion.  I think what we don't like about deck builders, or particularly deck builders with a limited pool of commons cards, is that there's very little variety.  A pool of five cards just can't compete with dozens if not hundreds of different cards found in a common deck like Race or Glory.  Plus, the role cards in Eminent Domain just aren't that interesting to begin with.  I think the Planet and Technology cards are supposed to alleviate this, but generally they aren't that interesting either.  

The game had some interesting ideas, but it just fell flat with us.  The game just felt very anticlimactic and lukewarm.  The deck building feels slow and incremental, and maybe we just don't like playing deck building games.  I'm not sure if we would ever play this when we could just as well play Race or Glory instead...

After reading the reviews, I had a bad impression of this game. Firstly it's like Race for the Galaxy and Dominion. Secondly, I love Race and to be compared to Race, I would say it's an unworthy comparison as Race is much better than it and to be compared to Dominion, well I not a fan of Dominion at all. 

However upon playing it, it was pleasantly quick and straight to the point. I do admit that the process are a little long winded: eg. to settle you need to put in settle points not once but twice and then take another action just to settle which could turn out to 3 turns or more just to settle. But all in all, it was rather entertaining to play and because of that I give it a 7 out of 10.

[2012-04] The rules should have made clear and explicit how the Icons on the upper left of the Tech cards are used. It would have been sooo simple to mention in the Boost rules that Tech cards can be discarded to boost the current Role. That would be %80 there.

The other wrinkle with the Tech Card Icons is that when tucked under a planet as a Colony, the other icons on the Tech Card are not used for anything in the way that icons on planets and double-sided face up Tech Card Icons in your Empire are used to Boost the current Role!

%100 there, but needs editing in the wording I provided here. Revise the rule book, this game could be a '9' rating. Makes it feel like the game should have been play tested more.

After having played a bunch of games I have other complaints. The Influence point values should *always* be in the upper right on all cards to help make them easier to find (by eye in your empire during the game and later for counting up for the win). All icons should be in the same place on all of the cards to make it easier to use planets and Tech cards face up in your empire to boost the current Role. As it is, they get lost among the other icons too easily.

Potentially very good game. Fun game, but so far it takes much longer than the 45 minutes noted on the box. The game takes waay too long, still over an hour. The random pulls of the +1 to deck size is extremely annoying - two games in a row I never even saw one, despite constant long survey actions. Frustration level too high but probably just dumb luck. If we could get this to the listed 45 minutes (close) then that might help.

[2012-11] ...and the 'board' is too tiny! I get annoyed at having to constantly neaten the card stacks. I don't feel like taking the time to create a larger board for this, but maybe some day. All of these nuisance factors keep us from playing the game often, which is a shame, as the problems are mostly in the presentation.

[2013-04-09] Oh, and the name! Another reason this doesn't get played is the uselessly misleading name. No one ever gets "space game" from this name. Cowboys and Aliens, maybe? wtf? Are we heading to the Pacific or to Alpha Centauri? This bad choice is further compounded by the unfortunate E.D. initials - what kind of dysfunction is wrong with this game?

Don't let talk of this game [i]merely[/i] being a hybrid of three-ish other games turn you off; this title stands on its own perfectly, and experience in any other similar title will do you no real service, just as that sort of description of Eminent Domain does it no service.  The general principles of the game--deck building being used to create skill specialization--is an intriguing concept, and well executed. The technologies are what really set this game apart, and the race for those that best support the vogue strategy will often define the game.

A deck building game where your deck is built based on the roles you have taken earlier in the game.  Effectively, you get "better" at the role the more you take it.  Other players can follow the role like in Glory to Rome.  You have a number of special science cards that provide benefits throughout the game.  You build a tableau of planets that help you acquire technology or produce goods.  The game blends elements of Dominion, Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy.   An excellent and under-rated game.

Glory to Rome in space?  If there was no Glory to Rome or Race for the Galaxy, maybe I would think this was brilliant.  As it is, I'd rather play either of its predecessors.

This is a deck-building hybrid game, with the role selection mechanic.  

While the role selection is important, it is not the heart of this game like Puerto Rico if you go different routes (esp in 2 player) in strategy then it can feel a little like multiplayer solitaire....or a race to the finish. 

Deck building is 90% by selecting a role, where you must take that card (and so your empire if better or more efficient at it).  The exception is tech cards you "buy".

EmDo could use more interaction or perhaps more strategic paths?  Even a more lengthy game in which you have time to develop something. The game and its end conditions are missing an "arc" or story.

UPDATE:  After 15 plays (with the latest plays 2p games), I think EmDo is a pretty good game.  Its not a game I think about alot or yearn to play all the time, but it is a fun "race" and has a place in the collection.  I don't think replayability is a huge concern, as I am not going to play this so much that it would become an issue.

Its not like discovering Dominion, Glory to Rome, or PR....but that's OK.  It doesn't have to be as fantastic as those games to have a place on my shelf.

9/2013 Another deckbuilding game with some twists.  Though I like this; good theme with very good graphics and components. Only thing is that it could have been "more"; probably to be fulfilled with an expansion.

It's so difficult to describe this game as it is a mixture of many excellent games together, making it very difficult to pin-point any single mechanism as the majority.
After 4 games in a roll (which is my first time after playing boardgames for over 10 years), I could do nothing but rate this game as a 9, though I still don't know why we (total 7 or 8 new players) all love this game and many even asks me where to get this. Yes, it's partly because of the short game-time (less than 1 hour since the 2nd play onwards), but there must be some reason behind this which I'm yet to discover.
The system, at first sight, may appear too simple and leads to repeative play. Actually it's not. The much limited research cards and different plants all forces you to think differently in every single game.
Lastly, I'd like to say something about the distribution of the game. I'm one of the kickstarting supporter of the game and nothing could hurt our (fans of TMG) feelings more than distributing the games at Gencon before delivering to us. I know the supply maybe limited so that TMG cannot deliver the games to all kickstarters, but I think it's still more appropriate to send the games to the early supporters rather than trying to gather a buzz at Gencon.
Despite that (which is totally unrelated to the gameplay), this is simply the best buy of 2011. You should get this ASAP.

Outstanding game, it's Race For the Galaxy, minus the luck of drawing good cards that match your needs. RftG did well by using cards that are useless to you as money, but Eminent Domain relies on careful planning by using some deck building mechanics. One of my pleasant surprises of 2011.

Was quite surprised at how much I liked this game.  I was a little weary at how well a space themed deck building and exploration game would be.  Was pleasantly surprised here.  I liked the differences between actions and roles on the cards.  My girlfriend really enjoyed this one too!  Want to try it out with 3 or 4 to see how well it scales.  I'm not sure we played correctly with the resource function of the game.  I need to look over the directions again before our next play.

Rating 6 based on one play. Interesting game, would like to play more but I'm worried about replayability - with most of your deck being made up of the five basic cards, there will not be much variation in the long run. And there is little control over the kind of planets you might get, further hampering the development of coherent strategies outside of the basic cards.
Second play, more or less confirmed my first impressions. Although I found with an emphasis on research you can make a deck with a higher percentage of special cards.

Added to my collection in November 2011. First played in November 2011.

A very interesting game. I only have two plays 2 player so far but I can see the parallels to RftG and GtR. Less so the Dominion references. In Dominion, deck building is the whole game whereas in ED deck building is the engine of the game.

Initial rating: 7.5

Update: Sold at Con-Quest 2013. This game wasn't going to make it back to the table when RftG and GtR are much preferred games in our group.

Not a true deck builder, since there is more decisions to make during other players turns not just what cards you pull during your turn.The leader/follower mechanic helps this. I rather enjoy this game and think it will get better with some expansions.

RATING: 7
More than the sum of its parts borrowed from more iconic games, Eminent Domain provides an intriguing puzzle of optimizing your own strengths while still being able to do useful things during the turns of the other players. There are a couple of easily missed small rules that delay the point where you’re really playing the game instead of just following instructions, but at that point, it plays pleasingly fast and has lots of interesting things to do and to avoid.

I’d like to explore it some more to find out whether it is as finely tuned and balanced as its forebears, and if this should turn out to be so, I might even go looking for a copy.

RATING: 9
Yes, this is a deck building game, but not quite the way you would expect.  You're not building your deck to make combos, but instead to beef up your role selection portion of the game.  Instead, each turn you're going to look at your hand, decide if any actions seem worthwhile and determine if there's a particular role you need to call.  After that, you get to decide which (if any) unplayed cards you want to keep for your next turn.  So, on a turn, you're making several decisions.  Then, you have an added bonus of decided to follow or dissent on an opponent's turn.  Constantly involved in the game.

The first few plays didn't leave a positive impression on me.  This game can be a bit opaque, when you're first starting out.  Sure, you can see that you can settle & produce/trade for points.  How do you get beyond that level and how do you tie in the tech cards is what can be confusing. It made me feel like I was a terrible player (I probably still am!), but now the game is unfolding.  You start to see how you can leech off your opponents and which tech cards can benefit you at certain times.  Quite a bit to explore.

Once I learned to focus more on the role selection and hand building instead of the deck building, I started to enjoy ED a lot more.  It's more like Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy than like Dominion.  Calling it a deck builder almost sells it short and can give you the wrong impression.  Sure, you're adding cards to your deck every turn, but a lot of times those cards can be a hindrance (hello, Survey!).  On the other hand, you can research and add more powerful cards (due to their actions and symbols) to your deck, which gives it a little bit of the standard deck building feel. 

The Escalation expansion really improves the game.  Adding scenario cards (where your deck starts differently from game to game) really made this game extremely re-playable.  I don't see a problem with this game reaching 50+ plays.  Rules are easy enough to keep straight in your mind that this will be fine for sporadic play, as well. 

I have Exotica, as well.  However, there is so much gameplay in Escalation it might be a while before I can check out Exotica.  These are the perfect type of expansions for me.  Adds a ton of replayability without adding much complexity or changing the base game a ton.  So much to explore and try out!

I'd love a digital version! 

I don't see this surpassing Race for the Galaxy for me since it lacks the depth of play compared to it.  However, this is still an enjoyable game to explore the game play possibilities in.

Update after 49 plays:  This game is addictive.  I tend to play this in bursts - get a bunch of games in over a short period time, think about it between those plays and how I could do better, move on to something else for a little while, then it pulls me back in.

RATING: 4
Provisional 7 rating after 4 plays.  This seems to be an interesting game with a somewhat steep learning curve (see: Race for the Galaxy).  Although it is fairly easy to grasp the basic actions and roles, wrapping one's mind around the way the roles are executed, how the game pacing is (somewhat) controlled by the role selections, and how the technology cards contribute.  

One thing that seems to make this game substantively different from the more typical deck building games is that there are more meaningful decisions to be made.  Someone once made the comment that there are few decisions to be made in Dominion other that what to buy on a given turn. Once you have the cards in your deck, most actions can be executed by rote. In ED, the interplay between the role, the other players, and your deck/tableau both provide more options and make the decisions more meaningful.  

Not to mention the decisions involved with what to discard at the end of a turn.  Should I hold on to my Colonize cards in the hopes that one of my opponents will pick that as a role, or should I go for broke and try to research something big next turn... if I can draw one more Research card... 

Currently I think I prefer two player, although I may also like the three player extended variant as much, I just haven't tried it yet.  

After 27 games, many with the bonus planets, no 3 player extended, and many of those 2-player I have reduced my rating from 7 to 6 because I am beginning to feel that the randomness of the surveyed planets greatly contributes to a player's success or failure.  Getting lucky with planet types and/or symbols early seems to be a dominating factor in the game.  

32 plays - this game is fading quickly as I find myself often in situations where I cannot find any chain of decisions I could have made differently that would have changed the course of the game.  

36 plays - trading this away.  I really wanted to like it, but it is just not enjoyable for me.

10+ plays with 2, 3 and 4 players

A deck-building game that has good game mechanics and amazing components. Even after playing it for more than a dozen times, I still feel that the game is too short. You spend almost the entire time building your deck and before you know it, the game has reached its last round.

RATING: 7.75
This is a different deck-builder in that you take cards by taking actions. That, along with the technology/research cards, is what made it a keeper for us.

I like the game, but I do have a couple of complaints with it. The first is that, at least in the base game, it doesn't feel like there's really a reason for having different types of goods. They're all used in exactly the same way. The second is that colonize vs. military don't feel as individual as I expected. The third is the stacks of special cards that you can get through research. I love that element of the game, but all the cards come out in every game. That reduces the variability. I wish a different selection came out each game, so that there were fewer options and greater variety between games.

(Also own Eminent Domain: Bonus Planets, Eminent Domain: Escalation, and Eminent Domain: Exotica.)

Eminent Domain is a card drafting game of space exploration and domination.  It uses the same mechanic as San Juan, and Race For The Galaxy, in that when the active player uses an ability all the other players can use a less powerful variation of that ability.  This keeps everyone involved in play even when it isn't their turn.

As per all deck builders players begin the game with a starting deck of cards.  Also, players have a starting planet they can either colonize or take by force.  From there players choose an action, by taking an action card from 5 available piles, then use these cards to explore the galaxy to find more planets to exploit, gain new technologies, and build up their war machines.  Once two piles of action cards are exhausted the game ends, and players count up their points.  Whomever has the most points wins.

I like Eminent Domain quite a lot.  I prefer it to both San Juan, and Race For The Galaxy.  It has a more interesting theme than the former, and it's symbology is much more intuitive than the latter.  Play this game now!

The poorer, simpler cousin of race for the galaxy, with a deck building mechanic which initially struck me as bolted on and not aligning well with the theme. That said, I didn't do too well on the deck building when I played. 

In ED it felt like they started with race for the galaxy (tableau building, produce/consume for points etc) then tried to work in a deck build mechanic.  Perhaps ED will grow on me after a few more plays.

Between adding planets to your empire and researching new technologies, the game successfully imparts the feel of building a galactic empire with streamlined gameplay and low downtime, with the only somewhat extended downtime occurring when a player researches new technology.

After only a couple plays, I'm enjoying this one quite a bit.  My wife, however, doesn't seem to grasp some of the strategy as well.  It may not make the table as much as I'd like because of that.  After playing San Juan, Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy, and Eminent Domain, I've realized that I prefer a bit of predictability in my card games.  I prefer both San Juan and Eminent Domain because I can decide on a strategy early on, and it isn't as reliant on card draws.  Glory to Rome is pretty solid as well.  On the same note, San Juan and Eminent Domain also appear to have less replay value.  Hopefully the expansion helps with Eminent Domain...

01/28/12 Played a three-player game. 
I did like Eminent Domain better than Race for the Galaxy and Core Worlds. Yet not as much as I'd hoped. I was certainly glad I tried it before buying it. For I now have no plans to purchase it. But I am willing to play it again. Points in its favor: theme, good use of icons, and the Puerto Rico style concept of role selection and the ability to glom on to another's role. Things I felt held it down: like RftG and CW no direct player interaction, deck building, the generic/interchangeable concept of the goods (the game doesn't even give them names!), and it seems to go on a bit too long. Our game only took 1.6 hours yet seemed longer. The game isn't dull, but it isn't exciting either.

Race for the Galaxy in deckbuilding style. Just like RftG  the artwork is nice and the interaction is quite low...

Towards the end the very low level of interaction get's raised (you start noticing individual advantages more and more), which is a plus. But it should have been that way earlier in the game.

Was nice to play it once. Wouldn't mind playing it again, but it didn't manage to get on my wish/buy/tradelist. I have a feeling that the replayability isn't high enough too.

If you want a more interactive deckbuilder with a S.F. theme: get Core Worlds.

This didn't grab me initially, but the more I play it the more I really like it.  Deck-building and role selection are two of my favorite mechanisms and this game marries them very well.  Good depth-to-play time ratio, ongoing player involvement, and good strategic decisions.  I find myself wanting the end game to be a bit longer, as it often ends just as I'm getting my real engine in place, but I prefer it ending a bit early rather than dragging out too long.  Plus, this can obviously be tweaked by using variants for the end-game trigger.

Only one play so far, but I enjoyed this game even if I didn't really understand what I was doing for the first few turns.

It reminded me more of San Juan than Dominion. Indeed I might even enjoy it more than San Juan, which is high praise because I like San Juan very much. 

Eminent Domain seems smooth and moderately interactive. With 3 new players the game ground to a halt at every research action because we didn't know the cards but I expect that would be different next time.

The other thing that impressed me was the quality of the components and the thoughtful design. It made it relatively easy to learn and play.

Fun version of the deck building genre. Theme is OK, but missing any flavor whatsoever. However, that can be a good thing, as not having flavor text or complex art makes reading the cards across the table easier and therefore makes gameplay a little quicker, especially for new players.

Good balance of weight and complexity.  Engine building is streamlined and brisk. Players make decisions during other player's turns, reducing downtime.  Not much variety or excitement in the early turns, but the game tends to end before the more diverse and interesting cards are introduced.  Sometimes it's difficult to catch up with or influence your opponent.

How do I react to this game? It's Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy, and Dominion wrapped into one. As a fan of all three source games, do I find the combination a recipe for perfection, an incongruous mess, or simply a vanilla reflection of three better games? I honestly can't decide after a single play, yet I find myself more motivated to play any of the other three than this, so that is that.

RATING: 6.8
A quick fun deck-building card game.  Pick a strategy -- produce/consume, military/conquer, explore/settle. (It's not as clean-cut as that -- everyone needs to explore worlds to settle or conquer to get rolling, for example.) Similar to _The Practice Effect_, you get better at things the more you do them, and have more of a chance to hold the correct cards to follow along when other people use the same action (some flavor of Glory to Rome here, but without the outrageous combos.)

It just doesn't work all that well in a situation where there's always new players involved.

Met up with the illustrious designer at the FLGS Amazing Discoveries in Tucson, AZ for a demo of this game and was incredibly pleased by the experience. This game sheds a lot of the stuff I dislike about RFTG and Dominion while keeping the appealing core of both games. Furthermore, I feel like I have far more control over my success and failure on a tactical level from turn to turn, and unlike RFTG, which I really can play inside a non-interactive bubble and still win, I found I had to pay really really close attention to my opponent's strategies and plan accordingly.

This is a must buy for me and will likely replace both RFTG and Dominion in my collection.

I thought for sure, based off the glowing reviews of the Secret Cabal and Rodney, my fiance who is obsessed about deck builders, was going to love it. She wasnt a fan. She loves having the dominion style of cards to buy, and this game just gave her lots of the same cards to play. 

However I loved this game. It was tricky and so different from other deck builders. It was refreshing. I want more but she wants nothing to do with the game. 

I did convince her to give it one more try. So I hope it strikes her fancy next time.

Game Rated: #2690
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If you haven't read any of the early reports, the game is essentially a hybrid of mechanisms from Glory to Rome, Dominion, and Race for the Galaxy. Essentially, Tasty Minstrel has taken the action cards from Race and duplicated them many times over. This set of cards forms your starting deck for a Dominion-style deck-builder, so that when you draw your initial hand you'll see, instead of Coppers and Estates, things like Develops, Settles, Produces [the names are only vaguely changed in Eminent Domain, but the functions are almost entirely a direct port from Race]. From this hand of cards, you'll be able to carry out game actions [exploring for new worlds, colonizing new worlds, producing goods, etc]. As in Glory To Rome, you can boost the strength of the action if you have matching cards, except they come from this Dominion-hand rather than your GTR-clientele. As in Glory To Rome, other players can "dissent" [read: "think"] to draw new cards or follow along to carry out the same action, again taking cards from their hand rather than a clientele of previously-played cards. After you're done, you "clean up", except unlike Dominion you can choose to keep a few cards until your next draw. The game ends when the VP tokens are gone [a la Race] or a number of role stacks are gone [a la Dominion].

The things you're doing in the game are colonizing planets [which give you points and the potential to produce and consume goods] and developing technology [which instead of going into your tableau go into your hand action-card-style as in Dominion]. You can "Survey" which lets you draw planets from the separate planet deck. Then you can engage in "Warfare" or "Colonization" which let you gain the benefits of the planets you've Surveyed [essentially, these two roles are just two ways of "paying for" your planets, akin to the two ways in Race]. Once you've got some planets, you can "Produce" or "Trade", which work exactly as they do in Race except each good is always worth 1 point and you're limited to producing/consuming a number of goods equal to the number of phase power cards you have in your hand. Finally, you can "Research" which lets you pick up the special action cards ["technologies"]; you're limited by the number of research phase cards you hold and the number and type of planets you've settled. These cards go into your hand and then get shuffled through your deck eventually, so that you can re-use them every time they come up. They do all the fancy stuff you might expect: "Settle a planet then settle again", "Produce 2 resources for 1 card", "Gain x points for each y", etc. Your standard powers.

The most original thing here is, I guess, the way the role cards are handled: When you "lead" a role on your turn, you take a card from the role stacks rather than from your hand, with the option of boosting the strength from the cards already in your hand. The little tagline the publisher's been using is that "As you take actions more often, you become better at them" because the role cards you've taken go into your deck to eventually pile up in your hand and give you even bigger boosts next time you take the role. This is cute, but it's not quite the revolution they've made it out to be. After all, the more you buy money cards in Dominion the better you get at buying money cards in the future; the more you buy cards that support a deck-thinning strategy the better you get at deck-thinning. Essentially, taking the free role card for "leading" in Eminent Domain is just a zero-cost mandatory buy. So, you'll be picking up cards that support your over-arching strategy ["Do I want to settle a bunch of planets or go for technology?" with the answer being "Take a bunch of colonize cards" or "Take a bunch of research cards", respectively] and then shuffling through your deck doing those actions. One of the bigger problems seems to be that some of the roles [Colonize] are just way too useful so everyone takes them, removing the specialization aspect and forcing everyone down similar paths.

The technology cards are cute, but are rather limited in scope [there are very few duplicated cards, so they're more analogous to GTR or Puerto Rico buildings in this respect than to Dominion action card stacks] and effect [by the time you've got enough "Research" cards to buy the "big ones", you'll probably only get to use them once or twice each]. Other aspects of the game are limited, as well; you'll probably only end up settling 5 or 6 planets, at most, during the game. Most of your action / progress will be taking new role cards into your deck, but [again] the variety here is limited by there only being 5 roles to choose from. The game ends up not having the heavy super-combo-building aspect of Race or GTR because of the limited amount and expected use of powers, not having the deck-tweaking / diversity-of-approach of Dominion because of the limited set of roles / actions and the need to have Colonize and at least a few Surveys before you can make any use of the Produce/Trade or Research powers that might let you specialize / distinguish yourself a bit. There are certainly some different strategies to pursue, but I have a feeling after you've done the two or three big strategies [Research, Colonize->Consume, maybe Survey-Colony spamming] in the game you'll have "seen it all". This would be fine if it had the depth / scope of Puerto Rico [which has only a few strategies], but it doesn't.

The main problem with the game isn't its scope, though [after all, I like Magnate quite a bit, which has a very limited scope / arc], but the complete lack of anything novel aside from the cute combination of mechanisms from the three heavy-hitters in the genre. Magnate has the funky probability distributions to deal with that drive easy-build-low-yield vs tough-build-high-yield decisions [a subset perhaps of "short term gain" vs "long term gain" tradeoffs, some of my favorite decisions / problems in all of gaming], which aren't really present in Battle Line, Lost Cities, Balloon Cup, the Catan Card Game, or anything else that it pretty blatantly rips from; this gives Magnate an entirely new problem to solve, and gives players a reason to choose it over similar titles. Eminent Domain doesn't really seem to present any new problems; it's a game entirely based on mechanics rather than meta-mechanics [the things you're using mechanics to do: optimize marginal gains, seek out game-winning combos, maintain competitive growth rates, etc]. Or maybe it's just that the central meta-mechanic ["select a specialized path of actions and pursue it more faithfully than your opponents pursue theirs"; see Puerto Rico, Navegador, etc] doesn't interest me much. It felt like Eminent Domain embodied the "nothing new under the sun" dilemma. "This does this, but that does that; pick one and do it more times than your opponent" isn't very interesting or innovative.

Update:  After 4th play, I do like this game.  But I like Core Worlds more.  I only need 1 sci-fi card game and Core Worlds is it for me.

-----

Theme is as good as Race for the Galaxy, with some tough and interesting decisions.  But way easier to learn and play than RftG.  Now playing well is another thing.

After 3 plays, I do like this game. However, it does seem like there is a lack of variety in the cards.  Especially when compared to RftG and Dominion.  I'm also learning that I'm not a fan of constantly shuffling my cards, more so if they are sleeved.

Bottom line is, this is a good solid game.  Trying to figure out if I should purchase.  I already have San Juan, which has some similarites in mechanics, and which I like quite a bit.  So I don't know if I should pick this title up or not.

I will probably wait until I give Core Worlds a try.  Yet another deck building game with a sci-fi theme, but a more war oriented theme.

Played this once and thought it was fine. Trying to play it again though has been like pulling teeth. ED just feels wholly uninspired. I can definitely see the parallels to games like Race for the Galaxy and Puerto Rico, but it brings nothing new to the table. You make your deck out of a series of actions that make it feel really bland as far as deck builders go, and the special actions available are always the same from game to game, so there's no reason to change your strategy once you find something that works. The one positive of this game is that it can serve as a good stepping stone towards RftG, but given the choice, I'd play Race over this any day. Not to mention most deck builders out there.

Replaced by Race for the Galaxy, Core Worlds, etc.

RATING: 7.6
A pretty well-thought game. The mechanics are extremely easy to understand, yet the game play challenges your thinking at multiple angles as the relationship between following, leading the roles and how you get to yur goals are actually quite antigonistic. The mechanisms can probably stand the test of time, but the small downside is replayability doesn't seem very high as there are only a handful of cards to choose from, and once players understand the game (which I am sure should take a while), the game could possibly be solved. Still, it is interesting to explore the first few games with its puzzle-like mechanisms.

Eminent Domain was an early top 15 game in our collection as we were getting started.  The game lost some standing with the swaths of new titles coming in over time.  Just replayed it recently and I was reminded why I like the game.  The game has a fairly simple deck building element that you need to manage and exploit as best you can to quickly expand your empire before the victory points run out.  This game was at one point possibly on its way out, but this reintroduction has me interested in getting the expansions.

This game has flaws, that I hope will be worked out with an expansion.

Action vs. role is not always intuative, and I messed this up sometimes in my head, though playing correctly. Playing with 3 players, we found that the standard version of the game would be over before it even began. Colonize cards were gone almost at the start of the game. We decided to play the extended version only to have the same happen almost as fast to the research deck.

I hope this game will be fixed, because I see great potential, but as is it is shelved in my collection for now.

And we play the third game and we think: Well hell, now we have no idea what we're doing because we just played three games and each one was completely frikkin different.

This one has great potential, but it's early days... stay tuned...

Part deck building part space exploration. Think of this as a lighter Race for the Galaxy. Less variety but infinitely easier for beginners to pick up.

RATING: 4
A bland game that overstays its decidedly limited welcome. Hoped it would be a streamlined version of Race For The Galaxy with some deckbuilding thrown in, but it wasn't. Repetitive actions, uninteresting advanced cards, and clunky role selection make for a drab play. "Not bad, but definitely 'Meh!'" says my girlfriend. I agree.

RATING: 6
Stinks of Race for the Galaxy, which I hated, however this game somehow does it differently.  I have only played race two or three times but remember never wanting to play again.  Even though this game reminds me SO MUCH of Race for the Galaxy, I WANT to play this game more and get better.  

It is a deck-building game at it's core where role selection also goes on every person's turn allowing people to do something as well depending on what role is selected.  You are also building a tiny empire to score you points.

The base game is probably a 7, but adding the expansion makes this a 9. I love how it really opens up the design and makes ships more worth it, gives variety in the play, and in general makes this one of my favorite games of all time.

RATING: 9
A game that takes the best parts of Dominion and adds a Puerto Rico style role selection mechanism. I found it quite fun on a first play, and it's pretty quick too. 
------
On a second play, I still really like this game! It just works. And there's a good tempo going from turn to turn. There is much less of a luck of the draw factor here than in other card games because you are in charge of managing your own deck, and you start with a very small deck. Similar to Dominion in that respect, but in its essentialized set of actions and tactics, ED surpasses that game. (Not too hard to do, since I rated Dominion a 3)

BGG Hype-Train of 2011 (now with Kickstarter!).  Here we go again.

This game means well, and had it not come in the wake of Race for the Galaxy it might have meant more.  But it did.  Tying a deck-building theme to Race doesn't make the game better.  It makes it trendier.  It's not awful, by any means.  It's also not mind-blowing.  It's just kinda... there.  And when I'm playing a game and saying to myself, "I could be playing Race", something's off.

The biggest problem with Eminent Domain is its Act III problem, and its Act III problem is there's no Act III.  The story ends in Act II, often in mid-sentence, and as a result the ending feels rougher than it should.

ADDENDUM 1 (April 2013): OF COURSE they're making an expansion that puts to use the varied ships from the original.  OF COURSE THEY ARE.  OF COURSE that expansion could not have been included in the main game.  That might have gave the game depth.  Grrr.

O Eminent Domain se tornou um dos meus jogos favoritos. Deckbuilding de colonização espacial: você pode procurar novos planetas, desenvolver tecnologias, produzir recursos nos seus planetas e colonizá-los - por bem ou por mal. A linha de aprendizado pode ser meio lenta, mas é difícil achar alguém que não goste depois de duas ou três partidas.

Kickstarter.  Still digging into this one, iconography is clear if a bit garish at times.  Otherwise its been an entertaining twist on the deck builder and the role selection seems to work well.  It takes two established mechanics and combines them pleasingly.  Doesn't really rock the innovation boat but it is well executed.  I am waiting on some more plays before mixing in the expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
No original mechanics, it's an hybrid of Glory to Rome, Dominion and Race For The Galaxy. 

It's fun to play for those who like to build things, but there's not a lot of space for diferenciation.

Key features:
-> Fast pace
-> Constantly involved: you take decisions on other's turns
-> Easy rules, fast to teach

Contras:
-> Shallow; not a lot of posible strategies.

My fears:
-> Not enough turns to evolve decks. The game ends just when you start to do the interesting things.
-> Players with similar strategies will benefit from each other, while players with unique strategies will struggle.
-> Lack of replayability.

I've only played a couple of games, but for whatever reason, it has not ringed my bell. It has left me untouched. I tried to follow very different strategies, but the result was more or less the same.

********************
I played a 2 player game. This time, we had enough time to customize the decks, but it was the planets we got who chose the strategies, not us.

Also, I didn't like is that in midgame, you cannot adapt your strategy. It's not possible to get rid of that many cards and switching, for example, to a production/trade tactic would be extremely inneffective.

Science is the major source of points. Once you get it going, after 2-3 science roles, it's 2-5 points per ROLE. That's way too much, much more effective than any other strategy.

RATING: 6
Deck-building game where you do an action (for yourself) and select a role (that others can use in a bit San Juan style) every round. The role card then goes into your deck. I simply didn't like this "role goes to deck" - mechanic which also is triggering ending in game. I probably should play around it in some clever way but the mechanic has annoyed me in general in all of my games I've played this. Yes, I can see the point in the way it works it feels just wrong.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A deckbuilder that rewards concentrated play; ie, focus in a given area. Like the structure of its game turn, as it keeps the other players involved: 1) perform an action that only you benefit from; 2) perform a role (action) that you get a bonus for, but others can also benefit either by playing the same action or by taking a card into their hand; 3) rebuild your hand up to 5, keeping all, some or none of the cards left in hand. It is the last part of the turn -- rebuilding your hand -- that makes this game shine, as you want to have cards in your hand that you can use on another player's turn.

The theme works, but it is plastered on wafer-thin. This does not work to its detriment, though, and some who might not did the whole "space" thing (like my GF) might just get into this one.

Can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 5
Kickstart finally came through!

Deck building and role selection with a space colonisation theme. [i]Eminent Domain[/i] feels similar to [i]Glory to Rome[/i], in that after each player action the others have the option of joining-in or drawing a card; and perhaps it suffers from that comparison, because [i]GtR[/i] is a brilliant game.
[i]Eminent Domain[/i] has been a long time coming, and the publishers have used the time to provide fantastic illustrations and polish the rules.
The game looks fantastic, but [i]Eminent Domain[/i] feels sightly lacking. There are not enough interesting combinations to explore, and compared with GtR there is too little interaction. EmDo is good, but not great.
The three player game seems best: four players and the game seems to end a little too soon, at the point when players are beginning to exploit their "engine". Two player games seem to drag on longer than necessary. Maybe a little more playtesting was required. [i]Eminent Domain[/i] seems very likely to get at least one expansion, and I hope it does. In the meantime it is a pretty good game that leaves me wanting a little more.

[b]Eminent Domain[/b] was traded away in a math trade 3/12/14. (Received Thebes: The Tomb Raiders)

[i]This an odd one, this was a game we got early on and played it quite a bit. Then we got [thing=28143][/thing] which killed this game, causing Eminent Domain to become a victim of the Jones Theory.

Fast forward to earlier this month and I picked up a copy with the expansion thinking this would add something more to the game. It really hasn't, the new research cards are okay, but they just don't add enough to make this game exciting.

In RFtG you feel the tension of the dwindling amount of turns you have left; Eminent feels more like a crawl with a very abrupt end. In the end this is just not my cup of tea, and as you will notice later on I really don't care for deck building games at all. (The one exception is Super Motherload)[/i]

RATING: 7
Preliminary rating of 7 after first play. I won't record a score until I play it more. It was a fun game and it set up quickly. It seems like it would get more fun playing it several times with the same group and everyone understanding the cards. I think its strength may be in the quickness with which a game can be played and trying different strategies. I wasn't blown away by my first play, but I am excited to try it again. I like the core mechanics and really want to like the game more, but each game felt kind of underwhelming. Especially the 4 player game which we all agreed ended way too quickly.

This has become one of my favorite engine builders, and favorite games in general.  I really like how the deck building works, and this game captures the exploration element of games like Race for the Galaxy. I think this game is easy enough to grasp for a new player and has enough depth to bring players back.

I enjoy both expansions a ton. I think the tech is very thematic and really well done. I hesitate to play them with new players but I bring them to the table every chance that I get.

This game is really a game about exploration and possibilities. Every time I play it there is an excitement about putting together the engine and trying to react to what other players do. For a game that I think has alot of control there is also a ton of variety, which is a great combination in my opinion.

Playtested my own prototype. About 20 games, mostly 2 players. You may like the mechanics or not but the game is solid as stone. I tried to crash it and it won't. At first you'll try winning going full colonize and you may succeed for a while, but then... you'll try going full warfare and think you got it, but then... I think I'll try going full research but that takes knowing the tech cards very well (and those changed in the playtest version, so). From my experience, radical strategies work better in a 2 player setup. But with 4 people, a more balanced approach pays off much better. I think this is due to the "follow" feature, a neat design addition to this game.

Had a good first play, and the game was pretty much what I expected it to be.  I slanted hard towards research and it worked out pretty well.  I do not think I set myself up well to play off other people's turns, and I did not have enough emphasis on getting planets out one way or the other.

Your VP collection aim is mainly achieved by building planets and then using those planets to trade in goods. There's a Survey action you can choose to draw planet cards and place 1 into your tableau, but you then need to bring the planet alive by using later actions to get the needed number of colonise cards (Colonize action) or warships (Warship action). Once they're alive, you use the Harvest action to get goods, and then Harvest again to trade them for VPs. To allow differentiation of strategy, a 5th action is available to buy Tech cards which are useful for their actions and bonuses. That's the essence. In play itself, first you get to play a free Action from your hand of cards which no one else can leach from. Then you choose one of the main 5 actions. You draw the appropriate action card and add it to your personal deck (from which your hand is drawn), and then you get to soup it up with cards from your hand (eg draw survey, play 2 more surveys from your hand and you get to choose from 3 planets, and you've added another survey to your personal deck for future use as well). The strategy thoughts then are whether to concentrate on just a few action types so you'll always be able to soup them up, or do you spread out your deck across all the actions so that you can take advantage of what everyone else does in their turn - because when anyone draws a card and does that action, anyone with that same action card in their hand can tag along and do it too. As a result, there's very little downtime. The game was surprisingly tricky to learn and play correctly at first, given the powers and techs have to be learnt, but it seems simple after the first play. It leaves you with an urge to play again and try different deck building strategies - tech heavy, or specialised in 2 or 3 fields, or balanced. My doubts are that in a 4 player, and even a 3 player, is that: 
a) there aren't enough turns to be able to afford actions to strip decks and work towards big techs (and have enough turns to take advantage of them), and 
b) players who have similar strategies will pull away from divergent players and end the game early
c) there might not be enough game to game variety to sustain ongoing play, compared to other card-driven games like Innovation or Glory To Rome which have oodles of different powers to experience. 

Still, it's been interesting enough to explore and I'll get my money's worth while determining how big these issues are re long term stayability.

Genius! Great compilation of role selection, deck building, empire/civ building, and space! Very cool and streamlined! This varies from the solitaire feel when you really fight for the Tech cards. Seth Jaffee does it again, with Gavan Brown and others doing the graphics and artwork. I really really really like and enjoy this game !! Good vanilla, and with expansion.

Plays great as a 2 player game, but it does better with 3 or 4. The Bonus Planets are cool. I haven't played with the victory promo, but I will most definitely try it out when I can obtain one.

I prefer Eminent Domain over San Juan, and Race for the Galaxy. I love Eminent Domain as much as I love Glory to Rome, and 51st State.

One of my favorite deck-building games. I like players have an option to be doing something during other players turns. It keeps you in the game and also makes the active player think about what they do not what the other players to be able to do on their turn. The art work and quality of components it very good. 

As for gameplay it seems to win you need to pick a strategy and stick to it from the beginning.

Played once so my rating could go either way quite easily. It looks like it could be fun with people who know how to play well, and quickly, with multiple games in one session a possibility. I'm still not sure about the "staying power" of the game as there are many other games that do similar things.

Seemed like a pretty good deck building game; better to play than Dominion (although harder to explain to newbies) and less complex than RftG (easier to explain because there's less iconography to learn). That said, I'm not sure if it's hit the sweet-spot in terms of complexity as it still might be hard to get out in some circles.

SOLD, October 2017 (FalCon)


I really like Eminent Domain, but it was just not hitting the table.  We did play it a few times at bar nights, and while Michael and Weston enjoyed it, they were also not super-enthused.  Still, I'd have kept it around for the occasional bar night, but then Weston moved to VT, murdering bar nights forevermore.  Eminent Domain is not a good two-player experience, so I had to face the fact that it was not going to get played much if at all, particularly since it has no viable solitaire option -- or at least, not one as good as Race for the Galaxy's. 

Still, it was sad to let it go.

11/13/11 - Multiple roles and various paths to victory make this the best deck building card game I have played. The art and lack of art on the cards really fit into the Sci-fi theme of the game. It gets a 8 and has jumped onto my wishlist.

12/28/11 - It is now in my collection and I have managed to introduce it to several new people. So far, everyone has liked the game and I have watched their choices of roles. It seems everyone focuses on Colonize and Research cards with a smattering of Survey cards.
 
I myself have been taking the time to try several different role paths to see how they play and if they are viable choices. My first play, I thought why would anyone want to follow or play Produce/Trade. I researched it away not giving it a second thought.

Now that I have tried it a few times and it works well with Warfare or Colonize to rack up some VP. So what I am saying is this is a solid design and I feel all the roles, if played right, can lead to victory.

Based on one play: I played my first game with the Escalation expansion and I would not suggest that. The base mechanic is similar to many other deck builders with a slight twist in how you take actions and select a role for which others can then follow. However best to play a few game without the expansion since it adds a lot of technology card that you can buy and are difficult to sort out on your first play, plus the starting setup for each player varies causing a strong learning curve for new players. I will play again but only the base game to get a real feel.

RATING: 8
A great deck-builder, simple enough with the core cards and augmented with the researchable tech cards. The role selection takes a bit for people to get used to in m experience but once it clicks the game runs very smoothly. I would highly recommend getting hold of the expansion if you like the base game as the scenario cards are a great way of having asymmetric starting positions.
Although it is a deck-builder it is very much a race to build an engine (your deck) and run it to gain points, something I wasn’t really taking into account when I first started playing and got caught out when the game ended before I could sell a load of goods or attack/settle a planet.

The only issue I have with the game is that when you first start playing your knowledge of the researchable techs is so small you either don’t utilise them or don’t know which ones to buy. After 10 games I still feel that I need to understand that deck better as they are key to building a good deck. I imagine that this game would get even better if your group played it often enough that people knew which techs they wanted early on.

Medium weight game with a space exploration theme.  Uses deck building mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game combines the deckbuilding concept with a Glory to Rome-style role selection mechanic.  The twist is, the more you do a particular action, the more of that action card you get in your deck, which of course means that all players will immediately specialize.  Where this game falls flat for me is in the lack of variety.  All of the action cards are completely identical, and the planet cards only vary by a few icons.  Even the Research cards, which I guess add a little variety to the actions, only tended to differ by a few words.  Some may like the simplicity, but I wanted a little more spice.

Another solid deck building game. A combo of Race for the Galaxy/Dominion/Glory to Rome essentially. You're picking roles and taking actions, which your opponents can decide whether to follow. I wouldn't turn down a play, but I'm not sure it's different enough that I would want to add it to my collection.

(1 play) The thing that led me to try out this game was that it is a "deck-building" game, except that the decks are build in-game, as you play - not in a corner for hours and hours, pining over and over and over about hundreds of cards in a big collection that you have to mix and match and consider every which way (had enough of that kind of game).

The verdict - the game worked great! I really enjoyed the fast turns, the sense of building a space-faring civilization, the fast turns, the numerous difficult choices, the fast turns, and the slow tweaking of your deck of cards every turn to become the civilization you want. The only negative was the amount of time it took to really let the game "click". We had it by the end of the first game, so that's pretty great - but that first game took some patience.

This game features quite a few ways to achieve your goals.

Manage your resources wisely, because the game is over when so many have run out.

[floatleft][ImageID=843608][/floatleft]Eminent Domain is a good take on the deck building mechanism with some clever features but it lacks the depth I yearn for in games. I love the follow vs dissent mechanism similar to [thing=19857][/thing]. I dislike the lack of direct player interaction. I also do not like that their are different types of resources built into the game that mean nothing. It almost feels like the designer had more game designed and cut it out to simplify the system.

Fair deck-builder with a bit of San Juan thrown in, but - out of the box - little variety. I decided, on a whim, to go for a Produce/Trade strategy but the game seemed to not want that to be profitable. While I was waiting for my 'economic engine' to kick in, I bided my time building planets and accidentally won. The parallel to me, seemed like the Big Money strategy in Dominion: unexciting, but potentially powerful. Not sure about replayability, but OK. Just saw the ranking: what did I miss?

Deck building with a jobs system. This game is absolutely a cross between Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy.

Enjoyable deckbuilder.  Turns go pretty fast, gameplay is straightforward, even when it's not your turn you usually get to do something, and a single game doesn't take too long.

That said, there seem to be pretty limited ways/optimizations to build your deck -- I'm either building myself this way or this way, I'm either scoring this way or this way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Having grown accustomed to Ascension where deckbuilding means giant combos, this is another Dominion style deckbuilder where you're not so much building combos as simply changing the odds of getting more cards of certain types.

Use a card to do an action, then take a card from the center tableau to do a role, powered with more cards from your hand. Other people then get the opportunity to either use that same role (with slightly reduced effectiveness) or draw a card, then you discard whatever you want and redraw to 5. Then the next player repeats. So it's all about not letting other people ride on your roles and benefit from them.

I'd say it's about as exciting as Arctic Scavengers, but I prefer the feel of that. I want to have fun when I play a deckbuilder, not just be trying to solve a puzzle to win.

First time playing this and it was exciting. Like a very light RftG and that excited me since the former was too heavy for my group and my taste.

Lots of ways to victory but after a while it seemed clear that mid game research and conquering planets was the way to secure the win.

Will investigate further and looking forward to enjoying this even more as I try out a few other ways to win.

Also I only played one other person (2p game) and don't know how the interactions work with more.

Fantastic fast-paced card game. Easy to teach with some good non brain-burning strategy. Eminent Domain could be described as a light hybrid of Glory To Rome and Race For The Galaxy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Eminent Domain is basically a Frankengame, assembled from the mechanisms of three other games. Race for the Galaxy is deeper, Dominion is more streamlined, and Glory to Rome is funnier and has more eye contact. If you game a lot, maybe marginal improvements are worth seeking out. I don't, and I find "mechanism refinement" to provide diminishing returns in a hurry. 

Yes, collage and assemblage can be cool and take you strange places (see: Cornell, Joseph), but I didn't find any spark here. It was familiar, and it technically functioned. I thought the ability to keep a card in your hand before you drew a new hand was kind of neat, but overall, this was an invitation to stand at the Mechanism Buffet and serve yourself the same frozen food available at any mid-grade suburban family restaurant in a strip mall.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I feel like the mechanism Eminent Domain introduced to add player interaction to deckbuilding games is the best way to do it. You choose an action to take, and everyone else does the same thing except diminished somewhat. The phrase I like to think of is "passive interaction", since while you're directly affecting what your opponents are doing, it's more a consideration than the main tactic.

People complain about the tech cards for multiple reasons all the time, but I honestly don't see what the big problem is. The learning curve isn't that high since most of the cards are just "improved" versions of the basic ones. It's uncommon to have every single tech card available to purchase, too, so your options are more realistically between 1/3 or less of the total pool.

I've played it approaching ten times now, and fail to see anything particularly great about this game.  It works, it's short, but when there are several other card games which I rate an 8 or higher, I struggle to see how it will get many more plays - and I've only played it as much as I have in order to try to extract some value from its purchase.

This is not a game I would have purchased were it not for my having been taken in by the Kickstarter hype.  And beware of certain companies which promise exclusive bonuses for backers, and deliver nothing more than one cheaply-printed card without rounded corners, falling far short of their own promises.  For a game which arrived at its backers several weeks after it arrived in the shops.

Fortunately I only get fooled once by any particular company.

It's quick, it looks awful pretty for what it is and it has some variety, plus the rather unique and organic way in which the deck building mechanic works (if you lead a role, that particular role becomes more prominent in your deck, so if you do it, you get better at it) is quite pleasing. Tasty Minstrel doesn't disappoint, this is no exception.

A simple yet solid deck builder. Reminds me a little of Race for the Galaxy,except you could introduce new players to Eminent Domain much more easily. There's just barely enough player interaction here to keep things interesting, as players who can read their opponent's next move will be able to get free actions from their cards. The game seems to have a decent amount of replay value since what seems like a powerful strategy in one game could easily be much weaker when facing different players.

This is a fun deck-building game, but the more I play it, the more I am just slightly let down by it's range. It plays well in a short period of time, and my wife and I enjoy it together. However, in a four-player game of stronger players, it's faults are revealed.
The game favors very few strategies for success. In full games with each player trying a different strategy, the one player who is taking the "golden path" will almost always win. I'll leave it up to you to discover what those strategies are, but suffice to say some roles that are presented on equal footing with others aren't as viable as others if you are looking to win.

Love the theme, love how the deckbuilding idea, love the role selection, but something just feels a little......clunky. Hard to put my finger on. It's easy just to collect ships and attack all the planets you want to conquer. There is practically no incentive to peacefully take a planet. Also difficult to get some of the more powerful technology cards, as by the time you are ready to, the game is almost over. I'm hoping when we play the expansion, it will fix these issues.

While it is it's own game, with very clever and interesting mechanics, it is hard to escape comparison with race for the galaxy. I would say, generally, ED is a better game but some of the frustrating luck/arbitrary nature of rtfg permeats here as well.

Survey: draw 5 planets looking for something you need? Didnt draw it? Did it get revealed for the opponent to grab for cheap instead? Yup...

Science: like race, it's very high value...hard to imagine winning without it. Which in turn means…

Consume/trade: seems very unlikely to win :(

The deck building plus follow-the-leader makes for a fast and fun experience.  I like how the more you play a specific action, the better you become.  You want to be a little well-rounded though so you can take advantage of what other people are playing (due to follow-the-leader).

Eminent Domain is deck building game in the style of Dominion (thus presumably the title). Unfortunately while it has many interesting aspects the whole is deeply disappointing. The exact problem is hard to put my finger on, but I think it is this. Eminent Domain will only take about a dozen rounds or so to play. In the first three or four you will shape your deck in such a way as to shape your strategy for the rest of the game. So far this is identical with the dynamic of Dominion. But in Dominion the cards you use to alter your deck change randomly between each game - in Eminent Dominion the cards are always the same. So there is no equivalent dynamic of seeking out best combo from a new combination of cards - you never seen anything new.
Where ED should develop its own dynamic (and I would much rather this than a Dominion clone) is that instead of completely committing to one strategy at the beginning you should be adjusting and altering your strategy over the game. But there the game falls down. It all ends a little too fast to allow a shift in strategy, and in practice the cards that shape a deck in the early part of the game simply do not have enough impact on a 20 card deck to allow this option mid-game.

RATING: 7
An intriguing mix of mechanics from many popular card games - deck-building as pioneered by Dominion and copied by countless others, role selection with leading/following, as in Glory to Rome, with a bit of tableau building a la Race for the Galaxy thrown in (and of course the theme, and several of the roles themselves, are very reminiscent of RftG). Unfortunately, overall EmDo is a weaker game than any of those which provided its ingredients - not bad, but a little dull and definitely not as good a game as it might have been.

And having played with the Escalation expansion, I think they really should have included that with the base game. It still doesn't make EmDo as good as the games which inspired it, but it provides much that was missing from the original base game.

This game is very much like multi-player solitaire, which is OK in my book. But as a 4p it also feels like the winner is mostly decided by other players helping him along the way by triggering a chosen role, benefitting one player more often than the others. Probably best played if all players are veterans of the game to avoid this peculiar way for games to unfold.

I have played one complete game at Essen fair "Spiel12".
I like that there are two possible ways to get to control planets: by military and by colonization. The game reminds me of [thing=28143]Race for the Galaxy[/thing].
The plastic space ships are nice to look at but are rather unhandy (why need they have different sizes?); simple chips would be easier to count.

Update: the ship size matters with the expansion, which by the way is said to improve the game very much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very solid deck builder.  The only real difficulty at present is the fact that the starting planets very much set up the likely tech strategy - metallic leads to war/survey, fertile to colonisation & advanced to research/commerce.  In 2 player, this can lead to one player going down the war route, the other down colonisation - this in turn results in a degree of multi player solitaire as neither will follow the other.  

Also, due to the limited tech tree, there are questions as to diversity of strategies.  Nevertheless, my wife and I enjoy it and are agreed that it is worth pulling out at least one a month.

It looks like Escalation will really spice up the game.

I find myself thinking about this game more and more, even when I'm not playing it.

It is a truly brilliant design. I can't wait to play this game, and I am surprised how often I suggest playing this game. My only problem with it is that it only plays 4 players, which limits how often I can bring it out. If only it played 5. . . .

i liked the idea of this game and tried selling my friends on it. one day at the gameshop i was teaching this and a guy sat down who'd seen it online. i had mostly ignored research because the tech deck is so cluttered and unmemorable compared to what i considered the smooth, clean meat of the game. this guy, however, immediately focused on research. he grabbed a few techs, and then proceeded to stomp me and the learning players. okay. we tried again with everybody understanding a bit more about research and maybe a little less going easy on the new players. that slowed things down as they each had to read through the entire damn tech deck, but worse it fed him research follows! he quickly sussed out an untapped research path and push it through towards an even less-contested victory. i should have just given him the box and everything, but, having "solved" the game, he was done. so am i. i'm done. this game is ruined for me. i thought the exploration, colonization, and manufacturing were fun, but apparently that's the side you fall back to when you've got the right research. maybe this awkward puddle of non-random tech rewards repeated plays, but i'll never know. mine is for trade/sale alongside the shiney-boxed kickstarter expansions, if you're curious. or you can go play what this was supposed to be a deckbuilder version of, Race for the Galaxy: a well-recommended game you probably already own which certainly rewards repeated plays.

Good fun game in the same vein of Glory to Rome, not the same but in the same family but with deck building. You pick an action and role then everyone has a chance to do the same role meaning you do something every turn. The biggest issue is everyone starts the same. This was fixed with the expansion. Fun game but I will now always play with Escalation. (RW)

An interesting game. I enjoyed my first play. There are plenty of paths to victory, and all the variability could give the game a bit more life than San Juan. It seems like it's missing something to push it into the "great" category.  player interaction exists, but it may be too subtle for some tastes. Not a big fan of the amateur graphic design, It's gaudy and bland. I like the game, but I could see my rating going up or down depending on how subsequent plays go.

I liked this quite a bit.  Deck building without the game being all about building the deck.  You have to pick a strategy and follow it..  doing a little bit of everything will earn you a loss.  
My first game did feel a bit short, with the ability to buy tier 2 techs happening only in the last round.  I also think expansions will do nicely and I hope Seth will add a little bit of targeted player interaction.

Time will tell if this is really an 8 or if it will turn out to have no replay value and be a 7 or just turn out to have surprising depth and be a 9. As it is, its a great little game, but I definitely think it has some problems looming on the horizon. It feels like there is a lack of size in the strategy space, and the decisions you do make are just decided by the luck of your hand.

Cool and quick game with elements I enjoy: action/role selection, deck building, tableau building.

Thus, this game sits below a lot of other games with similar themes and mechanics, but it's still pretty fun and fits in a good time slot.

Game with bonus planets.

First play of this was somewhat disappointing - with two players, the game seemed to drag on forever. We ended up calling it after I got my warfare engine flowing faster than her colonize/settle one. The game was fun, but there didn't feel like there was enough strategy going on to warrant such a long game.

I've since learned that as I was going for Warfare, and Urse for Settle, and neither for trade/produce, this was to be expected, but it was still a bad first experience. With a few houserules this game looks like it could have potential - otherwise, not so much.

RATING: 7.5
Visual Appeal: (3)
I really think the art on some of these cards could be better. It looks nice, but not stunning. The box art, however, is very nice. I like the small amount of table space that this game takes up. Less than deck building standards like Dominion, but it never feels constrained.
 
Components: (4)
The components are high quality and the designer went with a glossy finish to the centerpiece and cards rather than a matte finish. It makes the cards really pop in a nice way, but they feel like they might wear quickly so I immediately sleeved them. I am glad that the "Escalation" expansion will add a mechanic for the different sized ships. Everyone always asks, "why are they different sizes?"

Theme: (3)
This is a game where mechanisms come before theme. The actions and effects of the cards make sense: Colonize makes colonies, produce makes resources etc. However, most of the theme comes from research and for everyone with whom I've played, this is coincidentally the most intriguing part of the game. Without the research there's little point in having different planet types and there would be little to no differentiation in strategy. This is definitely the one area that makes the game fun and re-playable.

Learning: (5)
This game is a breeze to teach. By this point everyone that I know has played Dominion, and they understand the concept of hand management is more or less the same. It takes a little more time to talk about leading/following roles, but this is the only real point of potential confusion. The rulebook does a great job illustrating the flow of the game.

Gameplay: (4)
EmDom has very few ways in which you can directly affect your opponent. It is like Race for the Galaxy in this way. However, one of my favorite things to do in competitive games is predict my opponents' moves. In this game (and Race too, but in a limited way) you are rewarded for predicting correctly and you can save yourself actions later down the road by planning this way. Sometimes you have to weigh your options. Maybe it is better to rush and end the game before your opponent gets things going. This pressure is also an enjoyable metagame for me as I am often slinging taunts at the same time.

Overall Fun: (4)
This game is a thinker of a card game. I haven't fallen victim to much AP due to my play style being more of a "play your instincts" type, but I've seen a few players who just don't know what tech tree they want to do because the planet surveys are so unpredictable. It is definitely one that I want to play often and it hasn't yet worn out it's welcome.

RATING: 8
Very derivative, but has a charm all of its own, and it's fun trying out different strategies game to game. Probably the most charming aspect for me is its simplicity. You have your deck and there's a satisfying flexibility to how you can build and shape it. With four players the game seems to end just as it's getting started. You don't really get a good run at using your technologies before it's all over. With two players it seems to go on a bit long if the players are running different strategies. Three players might be about right, but it seems to depend on what strategies the different players are taking - a trade strategy will struggle if the other two players are aggressively following say, a colonise / research strategy. The Colonise deck will be depleted quick as a flash and the game will be a bit of a dud. The more varied the strategies between the players the more fun the game it seems. It's a weird game in this respect.

It's a good game. Player interaction is fairly low, but more subtle than you think as players develop their empires and their various symbols grow. Strategic decisions are interesting and a good survey base is more important than I first thought it was as you fish for planets to compliment your strategy. It's fun to try something out, experiment and be different. How long that'll be fun time will tell. I don't think I'd bother with it if I was a Race for the Galaxy fan (which I'm not), but like I said, it has a charm all of its own and judged on its own there's fun to be had.  A good game takes about 40 minutes and gives you something to think about. Looking forward to exploring further.

----------------

After exploring further I've not grown tired of it at all. Quite the opposite to growing weary of it, I have seen the light and what the fanboys have been harping on about. Maybe I'm a bit slow, but it took about five games to work out I was only using half my brain. Maybe I needed that time for the rules to click so I could then focus on strategy? Building up an empire where you can effectively follow another player's role without expending any cards has become very interesting. Instead of using the extra icons to strengthen your roles, you can use them to diversify and set yourself up on your turn for a much bigger play than if you had just been picking up extra card through desisting. The game has a good length and plays well with 2-4 players. Thankfully there's more player interaction than I first thought. You're constantly looking at timing your role actions for when it won't benefit your opponents, or even changing your strategy if need be. Absolutely worth having a copy in the collection.

(note I have only played 2 player thus far) I feel a little dissapointed with this one.  The theme is barely there, and the game can end very quickly if players are going for the same roles.  It is OK, but I might houserule it to last longer so that technology cards can play more of a role.

Neat deckbuilding system with simple and fast turns but lots of different ways to approach scoring.  It's got the same feeling of frustration that RftG has when it seems as though you are doing all the work for other players but because the game is faster this feels slightly less annoying.
Hard to fault the structure and balance though - all the research cards seem to be interesting and have a place, and the trade-off between actions and roles works well.

Everything you've heard is true: it borrows heavily and shamelessly from Race For The Galaxy and Glory To Rome; it's deeper than it looks, but not actually super deep; it's thematically flat as a pancake.

I do want to play some more before deciding whether it gets a spot in the collection.

RATING: 7
Sort of like a cross between Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy, and Dominion. There is a lot of subtlety in the interactions between players, and in the timing for this game. I really enjoy researching for level 2 and 3 tech cards. They don't change between games, but there is a decent amount of variety in which cards you will choose to take due to world considerations and the strategy you've chosen.

I need to figure out the timing on switching into heavy produce/trade, as well as consider how good military vs colonize is. 

The game lasts much longer if people are not overlapping much in their role selection. 

With inexperienced players, Eminent Domain can sometimes devolve into everyone doing settle spam (there's no reason it couldn't be conquer spam, but I haven't seen it), which makes the game shorter and far more luck based than if players actually consider the best option available to them.

-----------------------

Both military and colonize are viable, and their strengths depend on which worlds you have. I sometimes try to delay my decision until I've surveyed a few times in order to make a more informed decision. Trade is viable, but switching from colonize/warfare into trade is tricky, and new players often dismiss it due to this difficulty. It's easy to try to switch too soon, in which case you won't be making many points off it at first, and you'll have an inefficient deck. It's also easy to wait too long, in which case you might not get any return from your investment before the game ends.

Obviously a Race for the Galaxy / Glory to Rome / Dominion hybrid. It works pretty well, gameplay is smooth and interesting, I really like it so far (~10 games).
My only concern is the lack of cards variety and therefore the limited replayability. It reminds me on Rune Age, which also has a very good and somewhat innovative gameplay but loses its fun pretty fast.
Looking forward to expansions, with more game effects, new techs, new planets and maybe components for a fifth player :)

It's easy to call this a Race for the Galaxy lite, but I would say that it has the potential to be more fun than Race.  There isn't the same "I have to look through the deck to get a particular card" feel that Race sometimes falls victim to.  The interplay between players (especially in a 3p game) is pretty cool since you can dissent to get another card.  Quick and easy to learn and the iconography is WAY more intuitive than Race.

[u]First impression:[/u]
San Juan meets deck building while trying to look like RFTG. Some clever things like adding cards to the deck being mandatory and at the same time being used as a timing mechanism. While it is much, much simpler to grasp than RFTG, maybe even San Juan - as everything is done with copies of 5 basic card and the unique cards are used sparingly - it has the same problem as Dominion for me. The logic of playing well is to wrap your head around the system which doesn't exactly hint at how does it want to be used and I guess there is space to explore there, but I don't care for learning counter-intuitive and/or oblique strategies when they're driven by the game (not the players). The game sets strict limitations and asks for optimization within those. Interaction exists and is more important than in RFTG, but it's in the end it's just same old leeching. Another thing I'm not fond of is graphic design, I generally like contemporary approaches, however it doesn't present a thematic narrative, like RFTG does. Instead it's more like being in charge of an empire, but using gameboy controls, so you don't get confused, and with this you're as far from the real going ons as the politicians are these days. 

Still the theme and  the unique playstyle make it more interesting than San Juan for me, but Fleet blows this completely out of water. For a MPS I like RFTG better and for interaction - Fleet.

[u]latest impression:[/u]
Currently still holding a bit above 1.0 rank, but it's close. It's just so uninspiring and bland design which manages to be much more meh than its influences. 
Elaboration: if memory serves the gameplay is about optimisation and memorising those few special cards that shape a "strategy" which means the playing space is very controlled and restricted and like a good little maze rat you count your steps and execute your path to grab a bit more cheese than other rats. If this sounds fun, more power to you. A few cardgames of this type lack so much excitement in gameplay and visuals as this one (for me).

[u]Rating down to 1.0 because[/u]: uninspired. Yeah it's a crime.  
[hr]The more I played this the more bland and pedestrian it felt. It's a kinda blend of tableau builders (like RFTG) and deck building, but being less than the sum of its parts. They decided to go down the path of having mostly a lot of the same cards, so it's more crucial to optimise around them, then to think on the spot how they go together (like in RFTG). Visuals are terribly uninspiring, not evoking anything and mostly looking like a game console. Oh and there's some leeching added to optimisation. Wheee!

2013: Unrated. I'm still up in the air with this.  It's got some neat ideas, which were lifted from the great games Dominion and Race for the Galaxy.  I've only played it twice, but I think I like the original two games better, and it always feels like the game ends just as it starts to get going.  Needs more plays.

2017: Sold, not 'cuz I didn't like the game, but it didn't make the cut during spring cleaning.  Would love to play it again someday, just someone else's copy. ;P

Eminent Domain was love at first play. I quickly requested to play again. I like that this game keeps you constantly engaged as you can choose to follow the role other people call on their turn. I was taught with the expansion, which I'm happy about as I also like the variable setup based on your chosen scenario. I have realized recently that variable player setups are a big draw for me.

Interesting take on deck building. The main meat of the game is role selection, and the deck is just a tool that is used to implement that. 

Unfortunately, I felt that they games were always too short, and that they would always end right as I was getting my deck engine running. Many times I would buy a top-tier card and never get to use it because the game ended soon after.

Card, Deck-building. Really enjoyed this. I know it takes a lot of mechanisms from other games (some of which I haven't played), but it works very well and plays quickly. The specialization aspect of the deckbuilding is brilliant and effective. Looking forward to more plays, and also seeing how it does with 2p and 4p (I only played it 3p so far).

Not sure how long its legs are. I could see the game getting a little samey after while once you've played it enough to see different strategies at work. Time will tell.

Traded. I was worried about replayability, plus nobody else in my group wanted to play it more to see, so off it went.

Well, it's certainly better than the symbol-crazy Race for Galaxy, but it's also certainly not as good as 	
Dominion.  The idea that you get these little plastic spaceships and that you use them to attack yourself rather than your opponents really tells you everything you need to know about confrontation-phobic Eurogame designers; at least Dominion has the cards like the Militia and Witch.  The game reminded me of San Juan, but it's been a long time since I've played that one.

The game too often results in one person going warfare, the other with colonization, so no real competition between players for cards etc.  Variable starting powers doesn't really interest me.

Race for the Galaxy: Dominion style.  It meshes in a way that it feels different enough from either of those two games. It justifies its existence, but it is really hard to play this and not continually think about those games.  That said, it does have one of the things that I've been wanting to see in a game, where when you take an action you get experience at it and get better at taking that action again.

I fear because the same tech cards are always in play that obvious strategies might develop, but it will be fun to play until that wears thin.

This desperately needs the bonus planets expansion.

Six plays in and I am loving this game.

There are many strategies that work well and mixing them is a viable option as well.  

The only con at this point is that every turn is so open that it can lead to some AP. And the large variety of technologies can lead to long breaks looking at the guide to decide what is best for your deck. I am hoping this will be alleviated with more plays by our group.

I am looking forward to continuing to play this. I will update comment after more plays. 

UPDATE: I attempted to teach this to a group of non-gamer friends. This game made their head explode. They hated it. They could not wrap their head around the Lead/Follow and leader bonus. It was uncomfortable playing through the game as you could see them dreading every turn.

I think ED is a good game.  It feels like the designer has meshed together Race for the Galaxy, Glory to Rome, and Dominion to create it.  It's really stunning how the game has taken major parts of those three games to create this and that the game works well enough!  So while it is not an original idea to be sure, it works fine and I thought it was okay.  But is it better than any of those games?  No, I don't think so.  Maybe better than GtR, but not the others.

YES YES! More Seth Jaffee! I love this game! Will always play it if asked and will offer it up to play A-LOT. One of my most played games of 2012. 

The "following" mechanic is a brilliant way to add interaction into a game, but to not have it be "take that" or just dull attacking, or stealing/destroying resources from other players. The deck building is only there as much as it needs to be, and not thrown in just to get on the band wagon. The game has a touch of puerto rico, so some parts may feel familiar, but it will be a very unique experience for sure. 

The tech cards are really fantastic, and the whole game just flows well and seems to have been play tested well. 

Can't say enough about this zippy little game - really, just great. 

Oh, and awesome art too.

This is a good game, but I think the technologies prevent it from coming out more often.

I'm not much a deckbuilding kind of guy, but I have to say that I kind of actually like this one. I like that it is possible to cull your deck with certain cards and that you have to add the Role that you took to your deck, so it makes it more likely that you'll do those Roles over and over again.

It's a space-themed deck-building-ish game that blends some elements of Glory to Rome with Dominion and Race for the Galaxy. There are 2 main ways to get VP: control planets (either colonize them, or attack them with armies) or produce ("harvest") goods from your worlds then trade those in for VP. Of course, you'll generally do at least a little of both. The key highlights in comparison to those other games:
- on your turn, you choose a role; everyone else may either follow (for a weaker version, usually) or draw a card
- the chosen role is taken from a common supply and simply added to your deck; no purchasing required
- you can boost the role by also playing matching cards (icons) from your hand
- you can hold some of your cards at the end of your turn

Clearly, I enjoyed my games. Thinking more about it, though, you realize that little changes from game to game: only the order in which planets happen to come up. And the planets have only minor differences: 3 types, with variable defense/colonization requirements, some with one or two of 4 possible goods (which are really not different from one another). I think this game is going to need some expansions -- maybe new planets, additional roles, some differentiation between the goods -- if it's to have any kind of staying power.

The "learning variant" of the game without the technology cards is a bit too lean for me.

At first what I saw was a Race for the Galaxy clone but once it was taught to me and I started to play I saw that while it may have gotten a lot of its influence and ideas from RftG it changed enough of the formula to have its own personality.  The idea of having the different roles you play actually be the collection of cards in your deck is original enough to be interesting and the uses of these roles seems well balanced and implemented.

Where the game fell short is the lack of variety.  Once the game was up and running it became clear that there wasn't enough to keep me interested through even the end of that first game.  There are only really 3 types of planets (ones that gave bonuses to hand size or symbols for boosting, ones that held multiple resources, and ones that gave you huge amounts of victory points) and because of that there aren't very many interesting strategies to pursue during the game.  You could adjust a little bit to take advantage of the bonus symbols or resource slots on your planets but for the most part what you do at the beginning of the game is what you do in the middle and end of the game.  Namely either focus on warfare, colonization, or a hybrid of the two.

Like I said, the game is different enough to be its own thing rather than just another Race for the Galaxy clone.  It's just cripplingly average.

The above comments only refer to the game without technology cards and with the technology cards it is elevated some.  Each player gets to diversify a little more, the research role is more useful, and each player is given more options for goals and strategy.  I always really appreciated the neat mechanic of collecting cards in your deck that also boosted/activated the different roles you could take.  It was an original mechanic that worked reasonably well and with the technology cards the game has more personality.

That said though I think I would always rather play RftG or a deck builder like Dominion over this.  While it is original in its mechanics and has more teeth when playing with the technology cards I feel like the whole thing still boils down to a "colonize or warfare" strategy which isn't the most interesting for me.  But with the technology implemented it isn't something I would balk too much at playing.

I hate Games that I can't understand and I don't understand space Games or monsters Games. Fantastic themed Games are usually Games to leave apart. Eminent Domain, and the best I can say about it, it's not a bad game. I understand the different layers and the different strategies that players can follow but that's all. I really don't need to play it again because of the 4th wall.
The main thing I have to point out is the time of play which seemed to high for what you have.

This is an amazing card game and the components are out of this world! The games tend to be really tight and competitive and even young kids can pick up on the strategies pretty quick. The ability to piggy back off what other players do on this turn really keeps you involved the whole time. I love that you can succeed going heavy tech, resource, military, or colonizing a ton of planets. The space theme definitely comes through as well. All around, just a fantastic game in every aspect.

Despite that it is very nicely produced, plays quickly as is quicker to pick up than Race and GTR.

4 plays in and I'd have to say this is so derivative, - like a Taiwanese cover  of a beetles song. It takes some great mechanics and manages to make them boring

Unlike what others may lead you to believe, this game is HEAVILY built on the mechanics of Glory to Rome.  Sure it has similarities to race for the Galaxy and Dominion; but those are only uncles, GtR is the granddaddy.  The only similarities with Dominion are deck building and the fact that poor shuffling results in a better hand.  With RftG, it shares planet conquering/colonizing and Harvest/trade.  But the core concept it takes from GtR.  The game plays out by a player taking an action.  That action is generally only performed by the active player, but then the player drafts a card as a role from the available role cards.  This role is played, the active player then gets in add cards of the same type to increase that action, all other players then have the option of performing follow-up actions using that same card type by playing those cards from their hand or they may pass and draw two cards.  

So in reality there is nothing innovative here.  But I don’t want to sell it short.  Put all these things together and the game is good.  It is short, eventful, engaging and fun.  

I have upped my rating to 7 after a few more plays.  It does seem to have legs.  I think it actually has distilled deck building to a little more puity.  In this more than any other deck bloat can be managed and NEEDS to be managed in order to win.

This is an excellent action selection deck building game. Players are always engaged because they have choices to make on other players turns. The need to time when to start to thin your deck back down and change paths is a major part of the game. The paths the other players are taking can be a major influence on your strategy as well. There is no direct player interaction like I like but the expansion is designed to fix that. Hopefully it wont make it too fiddly as other expansions have done to games lately.

5/31/12: I'm biased against deckbuilders, but even among deckbuilders, this was a very boring game.  There is nothing at all interesting happening within the game, with no sense of development or progress.  Each round felt the same, as if the same actions were being repeated over and over again without much in the way of a meaningful gain.  There was no grand maneuvering, no cunning, barely any strategy.  Just playing the same cards over and over again, taking the same effect, reaping the meager rewards.

Not bad, but I'm not in love with it. Fills the same niche as San Juan but I feel like less is going on. I'm sure that isn't the case but I haven't played enough to see many different strategies in action.

What's obvious is that there are a number very nice touches -- like the different coloured VP chips and the start player quick reference -- that speak of incredible polish. Unfortunately, I feel like it's probably an amazing game to play frequently with other experienced players, but I'm not sure I want to play it enough to ever reach that level.

Dominion I like, but I could never play it frequently enough to really grow comfortable with the different cards available for every game. Race for the Galaxy I've never enjoyed - just too complicated for its own good. Too iconific. San Juan, I like - not too deep, not too complex.

After a single play, Eminent Domain feels more of a deck-building version of San Juan. I enjoyed it - a good combination of quick to learn and enough decisions when playing. I wouldn't assume too much about long-term replayability, but I doubt I'll play it so frequently that it becomes an issue.

After a few plays, I realised I wouldn't suggest this game, so it was given away to someone who will hopefully enjoy it more.

195/500 with Bonus Planets and Kickstarter promo.

Tentative rating of 7.5.  A good game that I'm usually willing to play and possibly one that I'd like to play more.  

My third play really opened up the possibilities of deck thinning and following a course of action with slight changes along the way.  Our first plays (2p) were just exploration of the system.  It's great if you can get the technologies to max out turns, it really blows up.  The extra symbols on planets are a must have for role boosting.  The prestige planets are a nice bonus, but the utopian planets are awesome.

I'd like to see if an expansion introduces more powers to the game and more unique planets.  Possibly making the different roles even more useful or interesting.  This would make this game top notch because the system is great as it is.

update : I like trying out different strategies each game.  This makes this game very interesting. 

update : I finally worked out the trade/produce strategy.  This is another viable way to win.  We now know how to really thin out the deck and grab proper techs for what you are doing.

I like role selection games, I also like deckbuilding games. 

This one flows along and tries to limit the amount of down time. It does this with a lack of combos, and the follow dissent mechanic. That mechanic either lets you do something or makes your turn cooler. All in all it does a lot of little things correct.

Originally this just beat out Core Worlds for a space on my short list, but then another of the local gamers picked this up. I enjoyed playing it, but not quite enough to track it down. Maybe it was also a sour taste over the exclusive nature of the Exclusive Victory Kickstarter promo. I get the idea behind trying to keep your original backers happy, but by making the card exclusively out of other player's hands the TMG kind of turned me off of their products. 
I received Core Worlds from my 2014 BGG Senta and it fills my deckbuilder in space niche for the time being.
That said, TMG, my opinion on the game can be bought if you're willing to make the promo more accessible. . .

RATING: 6
Another slightly mediocre deck building game. This time the deck gets clogged down with you taking an action which then gives you a duplicate of that card.

I tend to dislike deck builders because of their inherent randomness in card draws, tedious combo building and also the types of player that get enthusiastic about them.

In this game, I had 2 turns in which had I drawn 1 of the 1/4 of my deck that I was looking for, the game would have ended and I've have won. Because it was not until the third turn (by which point I'd cycled through my entire deck and found the ~4 cards I was looking for), I lost. Satisfying much?

Of course, that one play is not representative of the game as a whole but it does accurately sum up my feelings about it.

You now this from other games, but it`s still interesting. One thing is new. If you choose an action (here i mean role) you will get that card. And when you get more cards of that role, it would be easier for you to play that role another time, or play it better. So if you choose a rol often you learn that role better.

If you want play in a concrete way, you can play it. No mechanic that will disturb you or push you in a concrete way. That is not good, low replaybility.

I think a 4p game ends to fast.

La lecture de la règle laisse entrevoir un genre de Glory to Rome plus simple. En fait, le jeu est plus près de Race for the Galaxy, tout en étant différent.

Les tours de jeu sont très rapide. La mécanique fait en sorte que nous ne sommes jamais bloqué et que selon notre deck building, nous serons simplement plus efficace. Il faut aussi savoir tiré parti des roles sélectionnés par les autres. Le matériel est très bien. J'ai adoré!

RATING: 7.5
I've always lumped this game with Core Worlds because they came out at the same time and they are both deckbuilders about conquering planets. But I was surprised at how differently they played. I really liked the idea of Core Worlds, but the game took too long and it was tough to get any combos going. Eminent Domain on the other hand felt like an actual deckbuilder. I really like how the role selection works ala Puerto Rico and that you can always dissent to draw an extra card. I love how the action you take determines which card goes in your deck. It's funny how you might want to take the same action repeatedly, but then you need to keep getting rid of those cards. I like how researching works, although the first game I thought you had to take the card that was on top of the stack. I'm a little worried about replayability because it seems like there are only two overarching strategies (military vs colonize) and those strategies appeared to be fairly straightforward. Of course I could be wrong since I only played it twice. Either way, my wife wouldn't enjoy this so I doubt I'll be able to play it enough where replayability becomes an issue.

My wife and I haven't been able to stop playing this since we picked it up. It's an excellent deck building/role selection that allows for multiple paths to victory.

Yet another Dominion-like deck-building game, this time with a space-colonization theme and a smattering of Puerto Rico/Race for the Galaxy-like role selection and Uwe Rosenberg-inspired production and sale of goods.

I have played it twice, and I like the mechanics a lot for a deckbuilder, which I am not usually a fan of.  However, the game needs to be longer and maybe something else added....not sure what that would be, maybe player conflict or something.  Perhaps using your ships to steal another colonized planet with the right cards.  I don't know.  I think there is a good base to build on.  

Fantastic artwork and design.  I won't be buying it, but I won't turn down a game.

So far this seems to become a little repetitive, at least in my two player games. I'm hoping to give it a few more plays to see if things change.

Update: I've decided that between Core Worlds, RftG, and Glory to Rome, there's no room for Eminent Domain. Those games are far more varied and engaging with similar mechanics. ED feels like it wasn't very fully developed in a number of areas: a whole deck of technology cards that rarely get used, different sized ships that have no purpose, and different types of resources that all have the exact same function.

Sold.

Interesting mix of deck building and role selection in a kinda-4x-package. I like the theme and the fact that it is playable without needing to join two tables for the needed space and two days for the needed time. But I could imagine if you are not into the spacey theme, it might feel bland. And it does feel a bit incomplete with the elements in the game without actual function (different ship sizes and multi-colored resources). Yes, I know, the different ship sizes get function in a later expansion, but it doesn't look like there will be any expansions out in german language, and honestly, the usage of ship sizes there feels tacked on (maybe because that is what happened), too.

This game is fun and moves fast, but it feels an awful lot like playing Race for the Galaxy with a Dominion style card drafting mechanic built in. The game is lighter than RTFG but moves at the same speed and scratches the same itch.

A good game that, as up to now, seems a little limited by the amount of cards it has. The choice of the main actions is limited (in the likes of Race for the Galaxy), but unlike Race for the Galaxy or Dominion, the different cards come in only one way: technology cards.

The tech cards have a few uses: as per the icons it has, per its power and earning VPs (this is only true for the higher rank cards). But they take a while to get, and considering the "normal" game of ending when 2 rows of actions are empty, it seems to not really be worth - planets and trade earn more VPs and going by tech cards take you somewaht away from this.

Still, what bothered me the most was that, when playing with people not used to to it, you have two options: playing a blander game, without the techs, or going full on and having to halt the game several times while people search and try to understand what the techs do. Not fun either way.

I don't necessarily mind that this is made entirely from large chunks of other games bolted together - every game borrows from somewhere - but I want the result to work better than this. The basic system works OK, actually, but I found it very dull. Nothing interesting happens unless you can purchase one of the higher-level tech cards. Whether you can do this before the game ends is highly luck-dependent (I had very little choice in planets). In any case there aren't very many tech cards, so I can't see there being much replay value.

To me, Eminent Domain feels like a cross between Race For The Galaxy and Ascension (if that makes any sense). Since I own both of those games, I do not feel the need to own ED as well. The addition of planets with symbols that add to the currency required for additional cards is a nice idea, and the role selection mechanic of Puerto Rico works well with the deckbuilding aspect of the game. Unfortunately, the game feels quite solitaire and a bit unexciting. Still, I would certainly play again when asked.

Our game felt too long and we were pretty much fixed in our strategies (that felt like the best way to play for us). I didn't understand why there needed to be some much stuff in there: like many different goods, markers, different action cards etc... anyway, a lots of symbols that many didn't have that big impact on the game (or it felt that way). 

Positive thing to me was that although it uses very similar mechanics to other games, it felt less similar to them than I thought it would.

I'm enjoying Eminent Domain. Yes, it is very similar to Race for the Galaxy in theme and in style. I do enjoy the specialization technique where you gradually get better and better at your chosen course of actions. It's enjoyable as a race game with the one drawback as there is next to no direct interaction between players. Figuring out how to maximize your potential off taking an action rather than a role is one thing but there could be more without making it a war game component. I'm enjoying it right now but am interigued at where it might go in the future.

The idea of combining deck / tableau building with role selection is brilliant. EmDo may have been my favourite game at some point, however it has fallen somewhat. I can't shake the feeling that this level of complexity could support more theme: the planets are quite bland and the uninteresting basic cards tend to clog up your deck. Even the dozens of unique techs don't lend themselves to mouthwatering combos as much as they cause AP. EmDo is very good, but for a game of as much potential, even the smallest shortcomings feel annoying.

It's simultaneously too long and not long enough - you don't really have enough time to really get a neat engine going, but it still takes longer than Dominion. Colonization and Warfare are really similar in practice, and the trading engine feels really bland and dull. There also seems to be a bit more lame duck potential than with e.g. Dominion, though it's certainly possible to lose yourself the game early on there too.

In the end I'd pretty well always rather play Dominion or Race for the Galaxy rather than this somewhat awkward blend of the two.

A deck builder with meat to it, and cool components.  I wouldn't have thought that you could really convey the feeling of creating a space empire and conquering planets and learning technology in a card game with Deck Building, but here it is.

Base game is probably about a 7, the expansion really elevates it to something with a lot of character and variety.

I played 12 games of this before finally assigning a score.  I kept expecting that it may break in some situations, but it never really does, other than in some 4-player games where the game ends abnormally early, making for a very strange game.

It's fairly short to play (especially if all players are experienced), and it has some interesting decisions.  It's the best KS game I've bought.

This one has really stood the test of time, and now with the expansion I doubt I'll ever grow tired of this one.

RATING: 5
Unikely to ever touch this one again.  Samey theme, mindless VP grab, bland mechanics.  I went warfare, and I could tell because I got lots of plastic ships that were used only as currency.  Whoopee!

It doesn't help that the game uses one of the worst mechanics ever: role selection where everybody gets to do whatever you choose.  Eminent Domain is very derivative of another frustratingly boring space empire game, [gameid=28143].  Throw in a healthy dose of deck-building, as well as very generic iconography and art, and this is a real disappointment.  

Also, what's with the name?  Not only does it abbreviate to the uncannily accurate ED, but this game has nothing to do with urban planning or government appropriation, and the name smacks of somebody who doesn't know anything about the phrase deciding it'd make a cool title.  Who wants to play my new prototype?  It's a civ game called Tort Reform!

RATING: 5
I made up a print and play deck, fully expecting to like the game, and commit to the kick starter pre-order system. Turned out I thought the game was just ok, and didn't. I didn't hate it, it just didn't do much for me. The first game I played one way, going heavy on Harvest, then Trading for VPs. Second game, I went hog wild on Colonize, attempting to get a ton of planets. The thing that struck me with the game was that after the first few times of playing it, it was going to start feeling very same-y, as you always have the same 5 action piles every time. Contrast with Dominion, where each game can have a totally different stack of actions available.

(3.2012)  After 1 3p game, I found it to be a nice/quick card game with a sci-fi theme.  I like the unique you choose a role and now your deck has more of that role in there.  The game borrows from a few BGG favorites (Glory to Rome, Race for the Galaxy, Puerto Rico) and that is fine with me.

I am curious to see how it plays with 2 and 4 players and what effect using the "epic" or "longer" game would have on game play.   I can easily see get 20 plays out of this before tiring which is enough replayability for me - maybe not for some.

Gift from Francis December 2012. New in shrink. 

UPDATE: Rating down from eight to seven. I think this game has about ten plays in it, but no more.

I will probably hang onto it until I get sick of seeing it.

RATING: 7
Not a bad deck builder. Race for the galaxy meets Trains (without the area control)/Dominion. Nice that you have control over what stays in your hand. War seems superior to colonization but need more plays to see.

Edit: once you start colonizing or making war, it's hard not to specialize because that's your deck. Slightly easier to start colonizing first because you get 1 more card at the start of the game but not strictly better. 

Moves quickly. 3 players can finish a game in 20 minutes.

Finally I got myself a deck builder! There's a lot of interaction for the player interested in that, which is something other deck builders lack. The theme is great and the base roles are great, the only strange thing is the research cards - but after I played it more I think I'll get a better grip of those.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game has a lot of hype to live up to, for various reasons, and in a way, I think it does.  It takes the idea of a deck-building game but makes it different enough so that it requires a different thinking to bring to the game to do well.  There's no such thing as a "Big Money" strategy here, because there are multiple fronts you have to manage over the course of the game.  Planets are points-getters, but so is a strong produce/trade tactic, and then you have to ask yourself if you want to add planets to your tableau by colonizing them or conquering them.  It's a neat balance that keeps the game moving pretty swiftly, and it has a nice payout for the time invested.  I'm glad to finally have it.

Survey the galaxy to expand your civilization... Will you colonize nearby planets, or take them over by force? Harvest resources for trade, and do research to improve your technology. Build the best civilization and win the game!
\13\\13\
Eminent Domain is a civilization building game in which your civilization's abilities are based on a deck of Role cards. At the beginning of the game each player has the same deck of cards, with just 2 cards for each Role in it. Every turn you must choose a Role to execute (and like Glory to Rome or Puerto Rico, your opponents will get a chance to follow suit), and in doing so you will add one of those Role cards to your deck. When executing a Role, you can boost its effect by playing cards out of your hand matching the Role you have chosen. So for example, the more you Research, the better you get at Researching (because you'll have more Research cards in your deck).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This was a pretty good idea, combining role selection with deck-building mechanisms. I wasn't blown away by its execution here though, as I found the cards to be dull and lifeless, especially when compared to Core Worlds, another deck-builder that came out at around the same time with the same basic theme. I get why people like it, but I just felt kind of apathetic while playing it.

This is the first post-Dominion deck-builder I've played that didn't feel like Dominion at all - a good thing, since all the others (Thunderstone, Ascension, Arctic Scavengers and Puzzle Strike) have suffered for the comparison in my estimation. This feels much more like Race For The Galaxy or Glory to Rome - and my initial impression is that I like it better than those games as well. I really like how it rewards specialization like GtR, but feels more balanced and controlled. I'm very interested in trying this again to see if the strategic possibilities pan out as well as I think they would.

This was an easy one to jump into and enjoy from the very first play. I really like how the system portrays the different roles your growing empire can take. In my first play, being warlike and invading planets rather than peacefully colonizing them meant that my army would become larger and more likely to strike, while making peaceful colonization less lucrative. I think it's a clever way to make the deckbuilding system actually fit the theme. While there is no confrontation between players, each player's choice on how to spend their turn decides what benefit the others can acquire, so you are constantly keeping up with the activity.

#156/500 with promo planets and "super secret surprise"

Have only played twice but it didn't blow me away as expected. I read it may take a few plays so I'm hoping to get several more in and revisit the score.

I liked how you got better at things the more you did them. I wasn't crazy about how it seems you need to do something twice to get it done (colonize -> settle, warfare to get ships then to attack) but maybe I wasn't leeching correctly. The technologies weren't as exciting as I thought they would be either. Games went kind of long with 4 too.

With a couple more plays, things are clicking better. The optional action phase, when utilized correctly, is the answer to my complaint of "doing things twice". Techs are a little more interesting now that I noticed there are common ones in the decks but they have different symbols. Bumped up the rating a little. Also quicker with 3.

Rating bumped up. Played a few more games and each one saw a new strategy, there are really a ton of layers to this game. Played very well 2-player but I would expect 3 to be the best, and even better when everyone knows the game well. Every time we play I notice a few more subtle things that really make me like the game that much more. Really well designed and looking forward to Escalation.

I recall the first two times that I played this game ages ago, that I wasn't overly enamored by it. It wasn't until I watched a top 100 video a year later where the reviewer went on about it and how much they enjoyed it that I thought I'd check it out again.

My impression of the game has changed drastically since my original plays. The base game does seem a little too simplistic for me but I love what the addition of the Escalation expansion brings it. I don't think that I would ever play the game without the expansion.

I've been more and more interested in quicker playing games, especially ones that I can break out during a lunch hour. Hopefully this fills that void.

My rating of this game reflects my enjoyment of the game as a whole (with the expansion).

That first game didn't grab me the way San Juan/RftG did... but there seems to be more staying power here for me as deck building for your actions really makes some long term goals possible instead of hoping to draw just the right card.  The game seemed to drag a bit in the first couple of games... but playing with experienced players helped. I enjoy the flow of the game (save a good action for next round, cycle your deck... hope for a good follow opportunity...) Still... a lack of tension in the game left me at best lukewarm and as it didn't really catch on in my group either I traded it.

RATING: 8.5
Interesting as a 2 player game, sweetspot probably 3. Can be quite strategic and brainburny at times, but without too much scope for AP. Components are mostly very nice.

Most of the game's cards are abstract actions, represented by cards with no pictures, just symbols. Rather than building tangible things like space stations, you refine your deck of action cards to enable you to acquire victory points through claiming planets/technologies/trade.

Plenty of technologies and viable strategies give the game plenty of replayability.

With fewer players the game is very tense and requires a high level of concentration. As the player number increases, the game becomes more relaxed but can start to become confusing as players take actions during each other's turns.

The end of the game is very anti-climactic.

Raised from 8 to 8.5 with expansion which adds more use for spaceships and different start scenarios, amongst other cool things.

Best with fewer than 4 players. Escalation adds a lot, too. I prefer to play with a longer end condition than the rules suggest, as it allows you to build a more interesting engine.

Neat concept, and falls well within my preferred wheelhouse of "generic starting empire, which you can customize into a personal points engine".

It reminds me of Core Worlds a bit, but with less of a military emphasis and more of Race for the Galaxy-style production/colonize/military/tech points VC options.

This one sat on the shelf for a long time before coming to the table. Turns out, I should have got it out sooner. Everyone loves the combination of deckbuilding + role selection, and the Escalation expansion makes this game amazing.

Pretty cool, has a bit of legs but could get old after awhile.  Fun when it's new to you.

I wanted to like this game more, but because of it's short game time, I just couldn't get the hang of it or feel the 'empire building' aspect of it. Too bad.

For me, the drawback of Race for the Galaxy is the randomness you encounter during the game.  You can embark on what seems like a winning strategy, only to lose because of bad luck on card draws (of course, adapting to that is part of the challenge of Race).

This game has a similar feel to RftG but with far more certainty for the strategy you choose.  While there is still an element of randomness to it, you feel like your strategy vs. other players' strategy is what is making or breaking who wins.

I'd still recommend Race for the Galaxy over this one, but if you enjoy Race and are looking for something with a bit less randomness to it, this is a fun option.

A cool deck-building game with lovely artwork and a streamlined feel. I really like the idea that the more you do something in the game, the better you get at doing that thing. This is like a simpler "Race For The Galaxy".

Boring, some paths to victory distinctly better than others. Possibly fixed by the expansion?

What appears to amount to a crappy reimplementation of Race for the Galaxy in a card drafting game format.  It's basically lame.

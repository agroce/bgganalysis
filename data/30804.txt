This is an excellent set of rules for miniatures. You can play with everything from real figures to flat counters. It takes all the cumbersome stuff out and leaves you with the really important stuff. An extremely clever design. The activation system serves soloplay very well and everything clicks together in simple rules that take care of everything in such elegant manners you seldom see. You only need a small number of figures, but you can go for dozens if you want to.

RATING: 7
Very fun rule set. Have greatly enjoyed reading the rule book. Reminds me of how I felt when poring over the old D&D Monster Manual, looking at the (cheesy but cool) black and white line drawings and dreaming up ideas for games, creatures, and scenarios. Here you get to concoct your own warband and there are a lot of flavors to try and themes to create! The online warband builder is fun to tinker with. 

The rules and gameplay are streamlined and intuitive and create some great stories and moments as the figures battle it out. So far I have played mostly solo and am really amazed how much fun that is. Playing with Heroscape minis and terrain.

RATING: 8
Looks really good.  Can't wait to get those minis on the table.

Finally played a game.  It's a lot of fun - the activation rolls can be frustratingly against you at times - but you have to ride you luck.  Aside from that this is a neat little game system - it moves at a good pace and has enough to it to keep it fresh and enjoyable.  I like it a lot.

There are a huge variety of creatures and races included in the roster - and the special powers really make each game different.  It's possible to approach the game from a really fun perspective without the game experience ever drying out or disallowing you a chance at some success in a game.  There are some tactical choices surrounding what to activate and when, what to try and outnumber, what special powers to include, when to use a leaders abilities and so forth that really make for some interesting in-game choices.  And the game doesn't go on for too long!  A real blast to play.

The scenarios make for a fun game experience - where games aren't simply a slog-it-out marathon.  This both makes the game lay quicker, emphasises tactics and makes having a range of abilities in a warband something worth having.  A great fun game that doesn't take too long.

The best [u]skirmish[/u] fantasy miniature wargame and in the "Song of..." series. It works with fantasy miniatures of any scale. Great value game with simple, elegant and deep tactical gameplay. The heart of the system is it's excellent activation system (aka "push your luck"). The manual has a huge number of characters to creating any warband you like and it's possible to create new characters using the [url=http://www.ganeshagames.net/army_builders/SBHbuilderRevised-v1217.html]free Warband builder[/url].
I play it using Warhammer Fantasy Battle and D&D minis. I use a "Zone of Control" houserule, so figures can move a free little distance (under 1cm) to engage in CC.

Skirmish level miniatures combat system.  Players take turns activating their miniatures, one by one, rolling against their quality rating.  Rolls can be 1 to 3 dice, allow for up to 3 potential actions, but if you roll two failures you're done for the turn.  Very nice little system - play it safe and roll 1 die, or push your luck and risk disaster.  Actions are spent moving and fighting - simple die roll and apply modifiers.  Lovely little system - perfect to get that box of old minis into action again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This looks like an awesome tabletop rules set. 

I can't help but see all the similarities to Blood Bowl. Do your important stuff, since if you blow an activation your turn ends. Also every melee results in a push, knockdown, or a kill so there's no static lines.

Lacking in fluff, which is a real problem getting passion for the game. But there's no reason you can't import the fluff from Mordheim or whatever.

RATING: 8
Absolutely love the simplicity of this system. There are only two numbered "stats" that are both very abstract: Quality and Combat. Figs also (possibly) have "special rules" which are basically verbal cues indicating special rules (duh) that apply to the character... rules such as "Undead", "Leader", etc. These special rules go a long way towards giving each character/fig depth that distinguishes it from others. 

I can easily see these "special rules" becoming somewhat similar to "clichés" from Risus or "descriptors" from FU. This opens the system up emmensly towards campaign/story play.

Easy, fast, inexpensive, and flexible.  You simply can't find a more user friendly fantasy skirmish game for the low price.  The monster list in the back is extensive and well done.  All the creature design work has been done in advance. Plays fast and converts easily to any scale and any figures. Excellent support on yahoo group.  While it may not have the depth or detail of some systems they pack a lot of good gaming in what amounts to about 14 pages of rules (including very deadly combat).  I also have Song of Gold and Darkness which is an expansion/dungeon crawl that can even be played solo; Song of Wind and Water, Song of Deeds and Glory, and Song of Arthur and Merlin plus the Mutants and Death Ray Guns.  Converts very nicely to Lego scale (see my photos in the gallery).

Very simple miniatures game.  It gets a lot done with only a few rules.  It has too much luck for my tastes.  If you munchkin the system you can mess up the balance.  It does it's job well as a lighthearted fast paced minis game.

RATING: 8
Best set of miniatures rules (skirmish level) that I've come across.  Somewhat like Command and Colors in that the system maintains enough verisimilitude to produce interesting situations, while keeping the focus on fun gaming experience.  Manages to get rid of the need to track damage, places the focus on an array of relatively simple situational variables, simplifies movement to short, medium and long, simplifies magic into an attack effect or an immobilize effect... I could go on, but it really is a very cleanly designed system.  I much prefer it to Warmachine, which is the other system I know best, even more so b/c it is a product of a single individual whose written up the rules (and done most of the illustrations) all by himself.  Kudos!  I'd rate this a 9 if the rulebook was organized more efficiently and included better summary tables.

No rating yet because I've yet to actually put miniatures down on the board and play it.  Still, I predict once I do play it I will give the game at least a 6, because the activation is so simple but effective, especially for solo play.

The game's author answers emails personally and immediately, and contributes regularly to the game's dedicated Yahoo group.  He solicits and welcomes feedback.  That alone will probably bump the game rating to a 7 minimum.

An excellent miniatures combat system that has several excellent re-implementations.  Vastly less random that it appears at first, with tough tactical choices every turn.

caveat: unit customization is reasonable, but abusable.  IF you use theme to guide yourself, you'll get interesting warbands.  If you optimize for winning, things degenerate.  In general, I use the suggested units, and avoid true customization
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
just a touch too abstract. i played this for a ton of small skirmishes for a stretch. there'd be long periods of melee  rolls where nothing happened. (imagining long stretches of parrying got old.) ultimately, the level of abstraction exposes too clearly the fact that these types of games are statistical puzzles. 

that said, if i still had more time to build 3D terrain, i'd probably still use these rules. they're tight and simple rules for scratching the itch.

A very streamlined skirmish-level miniature system. The rules work, battles play fast and it's quite a fun little game. The push-your-luck activation system is very clever and works well. In general the system is a bit too simple to be a real personal favorite. I certainly dont' mind a game now and then though. The range of missile weapons is way too short and the ease at which units are knocked down to the ground is a little dumb.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A bit too simple (a shooting stat would have been nice) and the point system is not balanced, eg. does only work for certain types of warbands. Other than that, it is a very good skirmish system, which plays very quickly.

OWNED, but I do not list books here anymore as it distorts the figures for board games owned.

An excellent skirmish system with a delightful activation mechanic.  It uses a combat system tweaked from [i]Hordes of the Things[/i], which is a good thing.

I would rate it higher but for the following things which really bother me: 
[b](A)[/b] The lower the quality, the better the unit.  There is no reason for this non-intuitive system and it irks me enough to ding the rating.  
[b](B)[/b] There is no point cost formula given!!! You can find it by analyzing an excel file on the Yahoo group page, but this is silly.  A set of rules which builds warbands on a point system should, by any rational thinking, give the formula to determine points.  And some of us don't care for Yahoo groups.
[b](C)[/b] There is no compiled list of Special Abilities in the supplements.  I own the first two supplements ([i]Gold & Darkness, Wind & Water[/i]), and each adds Special Abilities.  But there's no combined alphabetized master list with point costs and Personality restrictions.  And there really, really should be because you're going to want to create armies based on fiction and you have to look these things up.  You should *not* have to look in three books to find what you need.

As far as play goes, it's a great system provided you're not irritated, as I am, by low quality numbers meaning higher quality.

A quick simple and fun fantasy skirmish game that can be played with any miniatures. If you are looking for a system with detailed magic rules and simulations of varying qualities of armor and weapons, this isn't for you. If you have 30-45 minutes to kill and want to play out an encounter between a small (5-10) group of dwarves and an equal size orc band, this game is great.

This is the best examples of "minimalism" in a core miniature war game design that I've ever seen. Each warrior has 2 basic stats, movement is simple, and command/control is handled in a fun & elegant way. The bevy of special abilities for each race/creature are what really gives the game depth and makes this shine as a fantasy skirmish game. Very approachable and fun, and great for creative people who wish to build their own scenarios.

[b]THE SHARP:[/b]

1. Simple rules.
2. Good points-based bestiary.
3. Small skirmish setting - no Minas Tirith sized battles to be found here.
4. Any miniature will do.

[b]THE BLUNT:[/b]

1. Awful, just awful, "knocked over" ruling. (Remove this from the game to add 1-2 points to the rating). I know that you need an "incentive", game mechanism-wise, to encourage players to maneuvre their troops closer and engage in battle, but their solution here is too clunky for my taste. The best alternative seems to be to add +1 to an attacker's close combat rating.
2. Archery ranges are too short.
3. Model movement needs expanding, or doubling.
4. Leadership is underpowered and undervalued.

RATING: 9
Absolutely love this game but it does have its share of issues. Not enough base pieces is the worst and the price is quite high but for the ww1 genre it may be the best out there in my opinion. Heavily recommend looking up and using Larry Harris' tournament rule updates, makes for a much more enjoyable game.

RATING: 5
Makes me believe I never liked Axis and Allies in the first place. I don't understand the sprawling nature of this one - and perhaps that's more a reflection of my taste in games than anything else. If I want plastic combat, there are other tighter ways to achieve it. If I want historical simulation, there are far better ways to see the arc of history. If I want a dice slinging smash fest, many better games are available. So that leaves this version of A&A with no place in my rotation. So not for me but might work for one who adores A&A and wants a longer, more involved experience.

There are a lot of complaints with this game : first there are not enough armies and discs too play the game. Second the fields of playing are way too small because contested area's can hold armies of different countries. So we used a lot of material of the base game : armies, IPC-money and the numbers to replace the crowded battlefields. Third it seems to me that it's impossible to win with the central powers. Fourth what is the use of the expensive tanks?

Only one thing is right for WWI : action is slow because of only one dice round : this is a nice changement to show the infantry war.

After one play as the British: Very interesting change of pace from the more traditional WWII global iterations. Provinces can remain contested through a turn with several nations pieces inside it. Rules for Tanks, Artillery, and Planes, give battles an added twist. Unrestricted sub warfare doesn't seem to have much teeth. The "side shows" of the war (Africa and Middle East) can be a bit wild and exciting. 

Having one plane in a battle is important, as it could give you air superiority and make your attacks all the more devastating. Tanks are good, but you really need several in one area to make big difference. 

The Central Powers seem to have an edge. Possibly because the Ottomans are so very much more powerful than they were historically.

Good fun and value for the A&A die-hards.

A piece of junk.  I really anticipated something more than this while I waited for the release.  When I finally got it, I was disappointed within an hour of the first setup.  Worth nowhere near the $90 I paid for it either.  One of the first games I'll unload when I decide to start selling off my collection.

RATING: 2
Why!? Broken and boring. The strategy is pathetic, the game is not worth playing to determine a winner. No need for some of these rules, and most just make it take more time for no reason. Everything moves 1 space with tons of territories to cross, and the fact you can only build in capitals makes it even worse.  "The only winning move is not to play." -Joshua

Great game, if slow. It does a good job at capturing the great war considering its A&A.
If you want a great in depth WWI game, I recommend something else, however, this is a fun game that can take all different historic paths.

Some commenters have noted that the Axis and Allies game system may be a better fit for WWI than it is for WWII.  I think there is something to this argument, and after a few plays I think that this is a pretty good game.

Again, like others have already noted, I have some minor complaints about the miniatures (not enough of certain types of certain nationalities, such as German Infantry, for example) and the map (the border areas between Germany and France, and Italy and Austria-Hungary can become very crowded with chips, soldiers, tanks, guns, and planes).

Picked up a copy during the August 2013 "Gold Box" strategy game sale that Amazon ran.

Pretty good so far. Battles are very bloody, as they should be given the casualties in the real war. 

Only issue so far is timescale and the map. It takes 2 turns to get german fighters to the western front! Which is odd since turns represent about 9 months of real time. 

Through turn 4. Lots of fun. Battles are a total bloodbath. Very frustrating exercise in getting German troops to the western front. Austria is really strong in the early going but is running out of steam by turn 4. Italy can't survive without help from France and the US. Ottomans can hold strong for a whild but British have a lot of options to pressure them (Persia, Arabia, threat of amphibious invasion in Ankara or even Greece).

RATING: 6.5
in some ways this game is quite fun, balanced and representative , but it is slow moving, exhausting, too much down time and i never got to see the final result of the one game i played.  component wise the game is a little disapointing as it does not have money/chips and i found that some countries needed a few extra infantry pieces.  i got a bad headache the one time i played this game towards the end of play so perhaps that skewed my opinion of things.  i would be willing to play again but under the right conditions and with more time to finish.

Purchased a second copy in order to augment miniatures, rondels, and chips.  Have 1/2 of a set of miniatures and 5 rondels for each power, a spare game map and battle board, and rules booklet/game box and powers storage boxes.  Remaining items have become a part of my main 1914 game.

RATING: 7
In my opinion it plays best as a 2 player game. At best a three to four player game.

There is talk in my circle of friends of it being heavily unbalanced against the central powers, but I just believe that it is easier to make essential errors early in the game with central powers.

Playability is 9 stars but the game is missing a clear set of rules, enough game pieces to play, no player aids, and no in-game currency that i had to rate it 8 stars. If you over come these obstacles, it is a fantastic game that I recommend.

RATING: 8
WWI grafted unto the Axis & Allies system.  Some decent period flavor, some anomalies.  Italy beginning the game on the Entente side rather than on turn 2 makes since when you play.  Austria needs to be distracted quickly else Russia gets knocked around.  One 'House Rule' I will recommend is making Switzerland impassable.

A pretty slow game when played with 5 or more people, but that's OK. What's not is the needlessly complicated rules book, an awkward way of keeping track on ICP, ineffective submarines, and the lack of essential and useful components. A game that CAN be fun but is in dire need of a few needful changes to become good.

So, not bad.  A nice change from traditional A&A.  The way the battles are slowed down (only one round of dicing per turn, for land battles, really slows down conquest), makes it feel like the ponderous slog that WW1 was, and eliminates the possibility for the Blitz type moves famous in A&A.

New 1 rating reflects my frustration.  Wizards has sent parts to players complaining of too few pieces since the game came out.  I finally write to them, and they let me know the game is good as it stands and that I am playing it wrong.  Game is meant for quick and fierce battles.  Well, if the only way you are supposed to play this game is with quick and fierce suicidal non-thinking non-strategic battles, I give it a 1.

First impressions: Beautiful box, great bits, and stunning graphics, but a lack of components is really frustrating.  The game play feels fresh and period appropriate.  The combined arms change and addition of tanks and artillery have made this a much greater game, although I wonder how much variability in game play there will be. The length. How am I going to finish a game of this!? Who knows but I'm going to try.

The title doesn't leave much to the imagination. Relive WWI in Europe and Africa. Yes, that Africa part was left to the imagination. A déjà vu? You must have read my comments on Axis & Allies Europe 1940. Unfortunately, the WWI version is less enthralling than the WWII version. This is mainly due to the fact that the number of different army types to choose from is clearly smaller.

I have not played beyond the out of the box rules, but I have really enjoyed this offering from Axis and Allies.  We did modify the rules a little bit by making Switzerland off limits (you'll see why if you don't), but otherwise we have had balanced experiences with the standard set up.  That said, even though we have had 50/50 Allied v. Central Powers victories, I will say that the Allied victory seemed to come easier than the Central Powers, but still, not bad.
This version plays very differently from other Axis and Allies games, so if you didn't like the others, give it a try.  If you did like the others, the game will still be familiar, just with a number of different twists that take you out of your comfort zone if you've been playing A&A for a years.
I like the aesthetics of this game.  My only gripe is while the infantry have different models for each power, all the other units are identical.  Not a big deal, but that is a nice touch in other additions.

Not enough components, no money or other way to track resources publicly, and most importantly... the Western Front portion of the board is too small, which means troops in multiple regions get knocked down every time someone puts a hand in.

I think I would rather play the original Axis and Allies, though this game is OK.  


This game is a bit broken with the original rules and so each game seems to start with the players negotiating as to what combination of technology rules and other changes will be used to "balance" the game.  I also don't enjoy the fact that the German fleet can fairly easily wipe out the northern atlantic component of the British fleet on the first turn of the game before britain can even react.  The game is also VERY long.

I like its clever combat system which gives me a fair idea of trench warfare and its difference from WWII. I like the infantry pieces, each power's being unique. The game could use a few more components (chips). The one really unfortunate thing is its potential to last forever. If the Central Powers don't win early then the Allies certainly will later, much later, so why should the C.P., if failing, continue (unless they just like the story)? There is no time scale. Perhaps a slight revision to the rules awarding victory for so much territory conquered (the major capitals were not conquered historically)  and a turn record track awarding victory to the C.P. if they're still around by such a turn would make a longer game worth the playing.

RATING: 6
This game seems so epic, and yet in a way so slow. I'm not sure why I rate it an 8, other than for its potential and my nostalgia. Trench warfare on its face seems like a very compelling wargame mechanic, but thinking about it more makes me wonder whether I'm up for a game of single-territory-per-turn movement.

It is beautiful, though.

Rerated as a 6. It's too large for the Nexus Ops 1-movement-forward-per-turn style of play.

I went into this game expecting it to be bad.  No way could the Axis & Allies mechanic handle WW1.  Much to my surprise, the couple of changes they made REALLY worked well at capturing the flavor of The Great War. 

Lots of fun!  The meatgrinders of trench warfare is alive and well in Axis & Allies: World War One 1914!

There were a couple of minor rule clarifications or tweaks that were needed, but otherwise the game mechanics are VERY sound and worthwhile.  

I will say this, the lack of enough pieces for the Germans and British, and lack of tokens, for even the BASIC SETUP is a significant problem.  If you don't already have a game of A&A sitting around the swipe some extra pieces from, you'll be in a pinch.  If you DO happen to have an extra game of A&A (WW2) around, you can just use substitute pieces for the couple of nations that need it.  

All in all, I had a great time playing this game, and will definitely play it again!  A solid 8 for me!

Just played with four players. Had fun, but took almost 5 hours for 4 turns - actually didn't finish turn 4, Central Powers conceded that they had lost the long game with Russia still in (barely) and the USA entering as well and France in Bavaria. Two players new to A&A, so that might have slowed things a bit. Lack of German pieces actually influenced German strategy, so might need to pick up some more of those, which is certainly annoying. Lots of sunk battleships, which was unexpected for me coming into the game.

The 10 is for game play only! Great WW1 feeling and a very nice alternation compared to the WW2 versions. Be warned, do not compare it with Axis WW2! Our group is complaining its ‘static’ (not my opinion) all the time but of course the game does not own fast panzer divisions or strong aircraft. Despite their critics we play the game since weeks and have a lot of fun. Especially after the game when we discuss the game and new strategies. 
My critics: Dammed cost cutters! Miss a production Chart, sufficient Chips, IPC certificates and a few more miniatures especially Infantry (e.g. Germany has not enough Inf. when it bought them in round one. It has to say ‘this staple of chips is Inf.’!).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This has the potential to be a GREAT game but out of  the box the  game is flawed by two main things things;
1.the lack of any strategic movement rules.Railways were of immense importance in WW1 yet are ignored totally in this game. Harris' own addendum which allows one strategic movement after the combat phase from one area (contested or not) to one other area (contested or not) linked by controlled territories improves the game immensely.
2. The relative naval strengths of the nations in this game are, frankly, silly. The British navy was bigger than that of France and Germany combined and the German Navy was twice the size of the French. For a more historical start, keep all naval set up as per box but ADD 3 German BB's to their fleet (making 4) and add 4 British BB's to North Sea (making 6 British  BB's altogther). Also add one german Transport, one british sub (north sea), one french sub (outside marseille) and one Russian sub (outside St.Petersburg) These changes make a Jutland style battle far more fun(as oppposed to the out the box set up where germany's submarine fleet (all 31 of them!)can usually destroy the entire 200 + ship British Grand Fleet on the first turn! The set up I have given leads to either an epic fleet on fleet encounter...or more likely (and historically) a stand off which can last the entire war.
Additionally, rules are needed to allow;
1.Stosstruppen
2.Some limited reinforcement of the African colonies
3 Tech advances (this war was full of tremendous changes in military advances)

Volcano has some interesting ideas on tech advances in his entry. Definitely worth a look!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
as with all versions of axis and allies, this game looks great and is true to history. for the first world war, however, this accuracy is a two-edged sword as much of the game involves very little movement of troops as you grind it out with your opponent(s) in a long war of attrition.

also, though the components look great, they are quite fiddly and tedious to move about and we wasted lots of time swapping out chips to get the correct number of units where we wanted them. in addition to that, we ending up using so many units that we quickly ran out of the proper components and had to improvise.

on the subject of the components, one thing that irked me was that the game does not include any way to keep track of your IPCs; you need to either write them down or use pieces from another game. for a $100 game this just seems like nickel-and-diming the consumer.

all that being said, if you are into the first world war and you are willing to spend an entire day playing a game about it, you should definitely give this one a try. but if you are just a casual wargamer i wouldn't recommend this one.

Preliminary Rating.  It seems to play ok, and there is good strategic potential, but the components (not sufficient number) is a real problem.
This is a $100 game and Hasbro has significantly shorted the game on unit pieces AND counter chips.  Really no excuse for that.

RATING: 9
There are (were) insufficient pieces in the game.

However, HASBRO has corrected this with me when I wrote and requested the additional pieces necessary to make the game playable.

Overall this game is a blast. It gives excellent feel for WWI with a good set of clear rules. The game is a little long-ish - going to last about 8 hours of play - not a problem for me, but for my A&A buddies this can be long.

I know that there are lots of people suggesting various changes to make the game 'more realistic'. etc. I understand where the designer was coming from, and I think he pretty well covered many of the important issues.

That does not mean there are some rules that should be changed. Personally, I (we) do not play with Switzerland being invadable. I have not decided yet if Italy should be neutral on Turn 1 or not. Beyond that the only chinge I might make would be to allow strategic movement.

But for now we play with RAW and have a blast. I would not recommend the game for more than three, or four - as the down time can be significant (if you have a large group try to get two copies of the game and play with a second set with different powers for the players to have something to do in the 40 minutes between their times.

Overall: Highly recommend this game-  and get ready for a blast!

After a half dozen full plays I have to rate this higher, as I have yet to think twice about the offer to play, and pester others for the chance to play. We play without the optional Russian surrender, and with Switzerland being a 4 neutral power. This game will only appreciate in value over time.

Mechanically it is slightly (but only slightly) reminiscent of Risk, in that combat is determing by rolling dice. But add in bonuses for combined arms, allied defence, and trench warfare and you've got a great amount of fun and strategy.
Few complaints : 1) the chips for units, though not a bad idea, are a bit fiddly, especially in the central european regions.
2) Not enough pieces slows game play down as players figure out how to split their forces properly
3)The track for IPCs (the currency of the game) is too fiddly, so it might be best to use a sheet of paper instead

A strong cousin to the other Axis & Allies titles. There are enough similarities for you to know this is an Axis & Allies game but the difference in units, combat mechanics and indeed the map and alliances makes for an exciting change!

There are only a couple of weaknesses which in the name of objectivity I will point out - there is a lot of talk of stinginess and a little laziness around the pieces available. For instance, no paper money and barely enough German units - which seemed to me to be a bit shortsighted but I wasn't too bothered. It was a bit of a shame that there is only one sculpt for every unit type as it may have felt a little thematically better to have a central powers set and an allies set, but I am happy to just to have a unique infantry sculpt for each nation. The only other slight concern is the universal implementation of tanks (which really did not happen) and it was a shame not to see German Stormtroopers not implemented at all.

Other than these points, I think the game is near on perfect. It's a challenging puzzle, with many different fronts and a whole range of interesting approaches to take. The battles are limited to a single round but nearly as blood thirsty. This changes strategies.

Once you come to terms with the idea that this is a game intended for you to play out World War 1 in an afternoon with some buddies,I think it is seriously worth considering. Some historical accuracy has been ditched but I believe this was to make a tighter game.  Lots of replay value too.

Depending on early dice rolls, this game can go two ways. Either it's A&A Lite, and can be played in a day, or it goes in a more historical direction and bogs down heavily and can take weeks. Being spoiled by years of playing the original A&A with the Gamers Paradise expansions, and then years of playing A&A:1940 (combined European & Pacific), i found myself a little underwhelmed by the paucity in diversity of units. Nonetheless the board is well constructed, the units are well designed, and the strategic possibilities are legion, which makes the game a lot of fun and worthy of a high score.

RATING: 8
Be sure to get the errata for this. Don't try and play the rules out of the box because there are some serious changes to things like movement that are fixed with the errata. 

The map also could have used with a smaller Africa and a larger Europe for practical game purposes. Europe gets seriously crowded with all the units from a variety of nations all crammed into one not so big territory. 

That said once you're playing with the right rules this is a really good game.

A fun light game but very long.  The big problem with the game is that Europe is far too small on the map.  Since the bulk of the action takes place there you would have thought the map would have been modified to create more room for the hordes of troops that end up there.  The game is more interesting if you modify some rules to make them more historical.  Some examples include modifying U.S. Build up and Italian commitment and making aircraft less valuable early in the war.

I really like this game and they've managed to make it feel sufficiently different from WW2 Axis and Allies.  Infact, I think the normal A&A mechanics better suit themselves to WW1.

There have been a lot of people moaning about an apparent lack of pieces for this game.  I normally put these sort of complaints down to overly picky people but unfortunately in this case it's true.  They've been really stingy with the amount of units for each nation.  This is a pity considering it's such an expensive game.  It's also a shame that, other than infantry, there are no nation specific pieces.

However, the game itself is great.

A fantastic twist on the AA system. The rule changes regarding combat rounds and the relationships between pieces works really well in the context of ww1.

The only downside is the playtime. We played a 2 player game which all in all took around 12 hours to complete. We were forces to play the second half of the game online over several days. BUT it was still a very enjoyable experience despite this.

I have seen comments regarding a lack of pieces. For our game this never became a serious problem. At setup units were spread thin but after the first few turns, casualties were so heavy that surpluses were high. Perhaps during turn 6 we were stretched a little thin again BUT by this stage we were spending more on tanks, artillery and aircraft,  and since these were more expensive and seemingly vital purchases we were OK on numbers. 

Whilst playing with a full player count would be fascinating; particularly as allies formulate their OWN plans and the east and west fronts and central powers squabble (inevitably), I think a full weekend of dedicated players would be a necessity and so this won't be hitting the table as often as I'd like.

I really like this game.  It is light enough for quick fun to scratch the WWI itch I get.  It does not really translate to a true representation of WWI, but it is a socially acceptable way for an adult male to play with plastic soldiers and tanks. A few cavalry units would be cool, but I have other games for that.

It's pretty cool.  Surprisingly evocative of WW1 for an Axis and Allies game.  Not having enough pieces was highly annoying. The game seemed more fiddly than WW2 A&A, perhaps because of the large number of chips needed for infantry and artillery.

A "1" may be harsh, but Hasborg deserves this. The game isn't broken, its just that for a $100 price tag, I don't get enough pieces, a crappy IPC recording system instead of money, and a bad rulebook. I'm a little pissed off, because I wanted to like that game. 
And the "1" for declaring the game "broken" is not that far fetched, as with that shortage of pieces, it's a pain in the a$$ to play. Stupid Hasborgs!

RATING: 8
While playing the game, it felt like an old hex and chit war game. This is possibly the best version of an Axis and Allies game I have played. This requires long term strategy and is as far from a typical 'dudes on a map' game. With the exception of the IPC chart, the board is excellent. This may be the deepest of the A&A series. 

My only complaint (and it is simply an echo of the multitude of these to appear) is: why are there not enough units? For the price of the game this is unacceptable. The game seems to have been thoroughly play tested so they must have been aware of the problem. If this was to save a bit of cash, then it was a completely dumb-ass move. 

Given that - I would still recommend the game.

I had my hopes up for this version but was scared off by the initial price tag for quite a while($100 msrp) I waited and found it for $65 online and was very pleased. WWI in many ways is more interesting to me than WWII. the A&A version lives up to much of the hype with a few minor hiccups. The pieces(minis) at times are not in enough numbers, I think the map while very well done, needed a little bit more focus on the western front. but the mechanics of the game are great and well represent the meat grinder that was trench warfare. Left out some traditional A&A dynamics like tech development and physical IPC's(The IPC tracking chart in the middle of the sahara desert is too clumsy and takes away from the map(in my honest opinion) Great production quality of all pieces and components!

The game as produced is broken and boring to play.  With heavy house rules (including the tech rules on BGG), extra purchased components to track resources, and more units or discs, the game is at least playable and can be fun.  I find the unlimited stacking to be annoying though.  Our games tend toward building mega stacks of infantry and playing chicken to see who will attack first.

This game takes FOREVER and I mean FOREVER. Honestly most of the WW2 versions are funner, both because of the time and because in WW2 you can pull off crazy maneuvers with Aircraft Carriers or drop off some tanks behind enemy lines and start a Blitzkrieg. More thematic though I suppose.

RATING: 7
It's a good game, A&A slightly tweaked to fit with the Great War (in a pretty nice way). Only being able to attack once per battle and turn is one palpable change. It feels thematically right, and doesn't actually bog the game down much (or at all). In my opinion, it makes battles more tense, and you have to weigh in the pros and cons of advancing a bit more than usual. Delaying battles, in which you're involved in combat but refrains from fighting on your turn, can be crucial. Another peculiarity is how aircraft and tanks provide small but important bonuses to combat. The third, and perhaps most important difference with regular A&A is that you're only allowed to mobilize reinforcements in your capital, which forces you to concentrate on the front where you really want a break through, due to stretched out supply lines. It also makes colonial warfare precarious. Is it worth the risk or not to engage in battle down in Africa?

The criticism this game has gotten is also valid: Not nearly enough components/minis (Russia runs out of infantry during setup), no money included in the box and a fiddly IPC tracker. Personally, I didn't have any trouble with the map and kind of liked it, once I got to play on it. Also, I had no problems with the straightforward rulebook - then again, I'm familiar with how other Axis & Allies games run.

[1 play] A decent implementation of the A&A system with structure that makes sense for WWI. The atmospheric feel of the conflict is there.

Drawbacks are: a very poorly designed map with the ever present unit and chip stacking problems, too much space dedicated to sideshow conflict areas, the incredible overall length of the game, air power die rolls being so very critical in some battles, downtime, the ineffective nature of Britain for the first 4 turns and America for at least that many or more, and so on.

This game is worth the experience to try, but I don't feel the need to play it again multiplayer when so many great games vie for table time. I would be interested in trying it 2 player or in an online version.

Most recent play Nov '14.

RATING: 6
The way in which the A&A combat system is altered to recreate WWI warfare is simple, elegant and very effective. Other than that, the game is loooong (probably the idea is that players are supposed to concede, but why can't this Larry Harris guy come up with sensible victory conditions?), wildly ahistorical (although flavour is there in a way or another), highly abstracted in handling operational issues, and I find the way in which the geography of France is warped for the sake of playability somewhat disturbing.

RATING: N/A
Initial Thoughts:

- Beautiful components, a lovely board, and the combat system is acceptable. It does seem as if it is an attempt at an abstract representation of trench warfare, which is a nice start.

- Board is too small to adequately handle the number of troops required in a typical engagement. Furthermore, there are too few troops and too few "multiplier chips". I expect more than enough pieces when I pay one hundred dollars for a board game, and more than enough space to play on.

- The entry of Italy as one of the Allied powers -immediately- seems to me to be a major problem and to unbalance the game in favor of the Allies. The Italians didn't enter the fight until 1916.

- The game could do with more period chrome, which I think could only add to the experience, but issues aside, it's a decent enough experience. Just not sure I got my money's worth here.

Rating is for the game using the designer's tournament rules, logicman's outstanding player aids, and Volcano's tech rules (and a blockade rule), as well as the extra components from the publisher and the IPC paper currency from historicalboardgaming.com.

The rules could have been written better for when you refer back to them, but for just reading through on how to play, they are fine. Not enough pieces in the box. That should be addressed,  but I always buy a second one for A & A games. Where does everyone come up with this $100 for the game? I paid $62 from Coolstuff with free shipping & discount. You wouldn't be able to buy many games at those prices. The game itself is balanced well & plays with a good feel for WWI combat. The combat board is the best of any A & A game. I think it's a great addition to the A & A line. How about a separate A & A game for the Guns of August, or the battle of Verdun next?

I would probably have to play a couple more times, but the one game I played I had a few issues with. For one, everything moved incredibly slowly, and you could only build new things in your capital, plus if you erred and accidentally forgot to build (or leave) an infantry unit on your capital, you'd lose part of your purchase to convert it into an infantry, because you HAD TO HAVE INFANTRY IN EVERY ARMY. This dragged the war on too long. Next, the naval minefields were entirely too obnoxious, mostly in their locations. The land combat model was interesting and made battles potentially very lethal, but once someone gets a few tanks together, they're pretty much unstoppable. The naval combat left a lot to be desired, particularly the idea of irreparable capital ships which had to slog their way to port to repair.

I purchased this game mostly on an impulse. Originally I thought I'd be playing it with my sons, however, both have decided not to play it. I have expanded the playing pieces, dice, coloured discs and added paper money, [thank you Historical Board Gaming]. I will play it one day, hopefully sooner rather than later.  
I finally played a 4 person game on October 22, 2016 and really enjoyed the game. This is a long slugfest of a game as we played about 8 hours and ended the game before final victory conditions were met. Now, in fairness, none of the 4 players had played this game before and our first turns were much slower as we all were learning. The last few turns were taking less than an hour each, so with experienced players it will go faster. The Central Powers were the winners as A-H dominated the game completely taking over Russia with a little help from the Ottomans. The U.K., France and Germany were all fairly stagnant while little Italy was pushing around the Mediterranean and the USA invaded Bulgaria. The real beauty of this game is the land battle board. Learn that and see how well the game goes. I'd definitely play again.

A nice change of pace from A&A WW2. Combat feels right, although movement is a touch too slow. Perhaps it needs a "Strategic Movement Phase" where all units can move any number of continuous friendly controlled spaces as long as they don't move to, through, or out of contested areas.

Fantastic old school Axis & Allies.  It does WWI right for a beer and pretzel game.  No messing around with technological breakthroughs, no extra layers of specialty units that would only serve to burden the rules, and a combat system that handles simulating trench warfare and stagnated fronts nicely.  The game does a great job of putting a premium on combined arms making infantry more powerful with artillery, and artillery more effective with air recon.  Tank make a late war appearance and can help get that final victory push going.  And transports?  Well catch them alone and they just sink!  The rules are very approachable and easy to understand.  I like the square map but wish the areas on the Western Front were larger.  The box should have come with a few more infantry units and plastic chips as they can get into short supply early on but I've found simple work arounds.  Still, I'm very enthusiastic about this 1st edition, and the way it plays.  If they ever come out with a 100th Anniversary Edition version I'll get in line for that one as well.

I like this game!  (And it is a GAME as compared to a serious consim like Fatal Alliances or even pseudo-consims like Paths of Glory)  Lots of good decisions.  While "Russia first" seems to be the obvious route, going France/Italy can work too.  Allies hard pressed early, especially since UK fleet is ahistorically weak, but seems to avoid the "scripting" that plagues many A&A games.

Lack of pieces is very annoying, and managing your pieces can be an unwelcome subgame in the game.  But this is an annoyance not "breakage."

Different combat things : only attack 1 round, first dogfight to determine if your artillery gets boosted. Artillery is very important here because of combined armed bonus. Tanks are hit soakers.

Gameplay critics : lack of strategic redeployment causing problems for Central powers. 

Too bad WotC refused to send me some extra pieces, the lack of them is obvious and many players have complained about. Therefor a lower score.

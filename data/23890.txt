Fun, but can be frustrating to kids who don't quickly grasp how to use the billow to generate wind. 

The components are amazing and are the reason my kids keep reaching for this one.

RATING: 6
A very well made game. Blowing the ships around is quite fun. My 6 year old can play this pretty well, but my 3 year old has some difficulties with it. To compensate, I allow him to adjust his ship a bit and give him a couple of extra puffs. Would rate it higher if he could use the puffer better. I may just switch to having him blow through a straw.

(KIDS) It's a dexterity game with blowing little ships around a big board to collect treasure.  I'd heard good things years ago, but it didn't sound all that great to me.  Now we have it and my whole family (ages 5-10) are into it.  It's fun, fast and light.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I like it. I bought it for my young daughter, but when we pull it out at board game nights, there's not shortage on onlookers.

When playing with kids, it's too easy to spot if they have 3 gold in one hand, but they can just put their hands under the table.

Also, the boats sometimes get caught crossing from one board piece to the next, even if everything is flat. Sometimes need to have another person hold the board as you fire away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
Classic Haba. Wonderful parts and great gameplay for kids and adults alike. However, the bellows are hard to use for little hands - kids need to be at least 5 and preferably older to use them, which is a pity because the theme is appealing to a much younger age.

Neat idea for a game!  I think it would be a lot more fun if the boats didn't tip so easily.  Might try playing it without the sails next time, as it appeared that blowing on the sails was a recipe for disaster anyways.  Overall, kinda so-so, but the novelty of the game idea made it fun enough.

Another well-produced, colorful Haba game that is great for kids, but creepy and weird if you're surrounded by middle-aged men squeezing an earwax remover to push tiny boats around a board.  It's a better pirate game than Pirate's Cove, which really says a lot as far as I'm concerned.  I'd gladly play with a table of racuous 8 year olds, but there is no good reason an adult should be playing this game with other adults.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I enjoy watching new players being overconfident about 10 minutes into the game, because this is a game that would easily lull a person into thinking "No problem. I got this down.".

If you squeeze the bulb wrong, the nozzle moves to the side, so it's not pointing at the boat at all. Then the person gets frustrated that the more they try, and more forcefully they squeeze, the worse they perform. I think kids would generally be better at this than cocky adults. :) 

Terrific, inviting artwork. High quality board and components. Good level of complexity, so you don't feel it's too simplistic. Recommended.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The kids love it and so do I.  We play with the rule that you can turn your boat in what direction you want before you use the bellows.

Very fun game of blowing ships about to try and claim gold and a worthy kinderspiel des jahres winner in 2006.  The game is fun for adults and kids, although you probably don't want kids much younger than 5 or 6 playing without adult help as they wont be able to blow the ships hard enough!

Exactly what I expected, but it looks gorgeous! The islands are raised off the board and players must blow their ships around them, collecting points and dodging the pirate ship. I like the robber mechanic: players take 3 of their gold and distribute between their hands. The opposing player picks a hand and robs them of 0-3 gold. Fun! The whole game lasts maybe 20 minutes and is a blast of fresh air (ha).

Hey, what could be more fun than blowing little pirate ships around?  As a kids game, this hits just the right mark.  Kids really enjoy blowing those things around and the production quality of the game is very high.  Make sure, though, that you set up the board on a flat surface, otherwise the cracks will kill your ship!!

This has great pieces and a nice board. The weakness comes in the connections between the boards which need to be smooth to allow the ships to pass. My three year-old had a hard time working the hand pump to move the ships and in the end the puff count comes hard to honor.

RATING: 5.8
2006 Kinderspiel des Jahres Winner.

I like the 3-D board, and the components--however the board is in 4 puzzle pieces & one of my pieces is slightly warped which means a boat often gets knocked over.  

In my collection this game is a little redundant since I have the HABA Black Pirate-The Duel game that also uses the bellows and the sane ships.  However, the game is different enough—this one is a treasure hunt/attack game, while the other a combat game.  Also, this one is best with 4; the Black Pirate is a 2 player game.  I prefer the Black Pirate-The Duel game which I think is more interesting.

I thought I would really love this game, but it turns out that most of the game is spent trying to make the boats not fall over, and that gets frustrating. Also, we were a long way into the game before I even got to squirt my own boat. Little kids will probably love it, but I wonder if they'll love Akaba even more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light wait dexterity game with minimal strategy, some screwage, and a lot of hot air.  The mechanic to move your ships is cleverly implemented as you actually are controlling the wind upon your sails.  The technique is a difficult one to master, and favors experience.  A fun light weight game, with a novel mechanic that lends itself as a filler for adults.

Even with practice, I've found that this is mostly a game of accidentally blowing your ship over and feeling bad. The fun parts (pirate battles, and pushing your ship halfway across the board with one perfect puff of air) happen far less rarely than you imagine they will.

Dexterity games are at their best when surprising and subtle things can happen. I might have to give up on this one.

This game is a lot of fun when we play with modified rules for the kids.  The blower supplied in the game can be a little difficult to move the boats with so we only count it when the boat moves more than a little bit.  I play with all of the full rules which evens the playing ground and makes the kids much happier.  We also play a rule where if the kids roll the black pirate they can move him until they either get to a bay or pillage another boat.  It was way to frustrating to roll him and not be able to do anything piratey on your turn.

Really nice kids game that is a dexterity game of sorts. Each player must use a manual air pump (bellows) type device to blow air into the cloth sail of their ships. If you can make your ship move into the harbour of an island, you can take a piece of treasure from it. 

The over-sized board and 3D islands are nice features. It can be tough for under 5 year olds though as they can find it difficult to blow the air directly into their ship's sails.

this game take a little practice especially for youg kids but my 4.5 year old got the hang of it pretty good.  Having a little practice time before you play will really help.  As the game is it is a beautiful presentation and a fun little dexterity game.  Nothing here that is high educational value but there is decision making whether to press your luck to go for something and understanding your own skill because you can still win if you play smart to your ability. Fun light dexterity game as really unique.

The bellow is hard for young children to squeeze. I was expecting more.

RATING: 6.2
Fun kids game, though small hands can have trouble squeezing the bellows with enough force to move the boats well. My 4 year old gets frustrated trying and loses interest when her boat doesn't move.

RATING: 5
Once you get the hang of the puffer, it works pretty well -- you have to puff hard and against the hull of the ship NOT the sail.  This is a little unintuitive and can be hard for younger kids.  Also, rolling 'pirate' on the die can amount to a missed turn depending on where people are.  So, the mechanism holds the game back for kids and the luck holds it back for adults, but it's ok for both audiences.

A fun game requiring dexterity in using a bellows to blow ships around the board. I seem to always lose to my young son. (I need to practice more.)

RATING: 7
This is a great game for game night with the kids.  I think it must be a bit inferior to Akaba since a lot of people don't like that the ships tip over.  I don't mind that as it offers a risk for going nuts on your 'gusts of wind'   My children love this one and it's a pirate game, so it's a win for me.  Over all I find I enjoy nearly any Haba game I play so I may be a bit biased in favor of them.  To me Haba is like the Pixar of board gaming...  thier releases are always innovative, made with kids in mind, and I know a ton of adults that love them also.

I'm not sure if it's really as great as Geistertreppe, but it gets an 8 anyway, just for having amazing components and being a clever design. Lots of fun for all ages here.

Well themed, well targeted, good fun. The bellows makes another appearance - last time it was for flying carpets, this time for pirate ships. The pirate ship movement and boarding idea in this game really makes it extra special. Fun for adults to play with kids too. Very good kids game, but you'll need to supervise the stealing of goods by the pirate - kids do have a tendency to leak from the eyes when they feel picked on.

I bought this game on something of a whim to fill out an order.  The use of the bellows to move pieces had attracted my interest in another Haba game that I had never bothered to purchase.  This one, however, involved a pirate, which is something that my children have become really interested in recently.  So, I went ahead and bought.  I am happy that I did as they both love it.  (I enjoy it, too.)  In fact, I often find it quite challenging to move my ship around at all as I often try way too hard and end up falling over or on land.  In that sense, I suppose there is something of a handicap when playing with the kids.  [06/21/2008]

[2 plays] In the first play, the kids were learning how to squirt air into the sails effectively, and although they didn't get too frustrated, I'm a bit concerned the skill inequities will be too great - we'll see. Anyway, this is an interesting dexterity game, and they were very engaged. Typically great Haba components.

Second play had all of them doing about the same with squirting the boats around, Orrin having the most difficulty I suppose. They had a great time, though.

Most recent play 11-16-10 with Orrin, Etta, and Ruth.

Meh ... Not so happy with this. Great Haba quality bits as always, and a huge sort-of-3D-ish board. Would have been great for kids 5+ had the bellows not been so hard for them to use, giving older kids and adults an unfair advantage.  Better for kids of the same age (6-7yo)to play against each other. Older kids will consider the game too childish, I think. My kid seems to have soured on this, and I definitely have. The huge box takes up an annoying amount of shelf space. I predict we will be gifting this to a kindergarten or something within a year or two, or it will "disappear" or "go into storage".

Cute kids game, pretty fun.  I wished that the gameboards were a bit more flat.  I play that even if a ship goes over, we let it stay, since otherwise, it would take too much time.  I like how you blow the ships around.

RATING: 6
A cute little dexterity game.

Roll the dice: add a gold token to the 2 indicated islands, then move the indicated ship (yours or black pirate) by blowing the bellows the indicated # of times. If you sail a ship to harbor, take all the gold on the island. If you sail a pirate into another player, that player splits 3 of their treasure between 2 hands: you pick which hand to take as plunder (cannot plunder the same player twice in a turn). Game ends when last treasure taken from board: player with the most gold wins.

An absolute hit with Granny, Grandad, mum and dad, kids, etc. etc. We play more subbuteo than windy bellows, but it works well, and the kids love the "which hand?" gold-pirating mechanic!

Named all the ships, islands etc, giving it a story feel, too.

Most fun and successful kids' game we've got so far.

This is a very engaging kids game that can be played with adults as well.  Using the puffer to blow the ships around is unique and fun.  There is a risk analysis part of the game as well when the Pirate steals coins, which is always fun for kids.

A deserving winner of the Kinderspiel des Jahres.  It takes a bit of practice to work the bellows effectively and very young kids will have some problem with it, but it is riotously good fun with for adults and kids 5 and up.  I would even break this out with a group of adult gamers in the mood for a quick dexterity game.

One of my favorite kids' games. The board is beautiful, and very colorful. The bellows mechanic is great.

My kids and I have a lot of fun shooting the boats around. Until kids are older, they'll probably need some extra squeezes on the bellows to get their ships anywhere. It's hard to control the bellows very well if you're 6 or younger, with very small hands.

Still, the pirate theme is fun, and we all enjoy sailing around for treasure.

I'm not sure the box needed to be this huge though...

I'm giving this a 4 as child's game.  The blowers are simply too hard to use with any accuracy.  It's especially difficult for a child.  Absolutely gorgeous board and pieces, however.  And the interlocking segments are ingenious.  Those who complain about this causing the ships to tip miss the point.  A folding board would have been far worse.  The only solution was to exactly what they did.  And for the most part all the pieces fit perfectly.

Adult, kid... doesn't matter. This game is fun for everyone. The dexterity part is hilarious and often needs to bouts of fist pumping and shouting when something extraordinary happens. 

A super fun family game or silly game with friends after a long night.

Fun kids dexterity game. Working the bellows isn't super-easy, but a 5 or 6 year old can get good at it with some practice. Crazy things as the ships sail around!

The game idea immediately grabs people. Although our 4 year old had trouble with the puffer so I rubberbanded it to a small board which helps greatly! (See my post and picture) Can get a little long. I think I'll try it using double coins for each die roll.

I'm going to give this to my newphew for his 5th birthday.  I tried iit out with my Mom and realized that he is just to young for this Christmas.  The Black Pirate is an interesting little game.  The board is beautiful and if I had a child that liked the game I would consider mounting it on a wall such that it could be taken down for play.  Depending on the children I could leave out the boarding rules but it does add to the play.  Do I avoid that island since the Black Pirate is near?  Do I go for that island with the Black Pirate or will I only make it quite close for the next person who happens to get control of the pirate ship.  Though dexterity is most important and there is luck ... stategy still has an important role in this game.  I say don't buy it since I am giving it as a gift.

Won the SdJ-Award as best kid's game. First I was unimpressed but my feeling really changed after several plays. When you have some experience with blowing the ships around the game runs very smoothly.
Kids often need some advices where to aim at the ship when blowing and I recommend them always to use both hands.
Almost all groups catched the rules very quickly and I am able to explain the game in less then 5 minutes now. It's very nice that you can explain some special rules while the game has already started...
The ships, the wooden coins and the blowing devise (whatever you call it) are of very good quility. The only drawback is the 4 piece puzzle-board that doesn't lie flat on the edges (but pressing it down at the right moment solves the problem).

RATING: 7
Great game, but it's fiddly with the blowing components. Fun and fast and whould have gained a higher rating from me if the board was straight (the board is divided into four parts to fit in the box, but sometimes the boats are trapped in the joints).

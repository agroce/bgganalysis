Love the ideas here, but the money values are way too screwy. All of the math needs re-worked so somebody doesn't win in one or two hands or people aren't completely out of the game after one hand. 

Also, playing through a single hand consistently took WAY too long.

I picked up the luxury set and it has some of the highest quality poker chips I've ever used, if not the highest. The game itself plays like Holdem except with way less lame folding (and no pre-flop!), more chances to improve your hand, and overall more fun and interesting, even when not playing for money. Highly recommended and would play often.

Poker with less reason to drop out of the bidding, and with special powers available for winning a round. Probably not going to be a game that a lot of people will want to play.

RATING: 9
An action game, with lots of decision points. In many ways, this is more Omaha than Hold Em (because you should be more concerned with the number of ways your hand can improve than what your hand currently is). I've mainly played heads up, but also with 3, 4 and 6, and it's a different game.

Here, let's design a Sirlin game together:

1. Take an existing game that is already quite successful.
2. Add a heavy dose of randomness.
3. Add gratuitous "special powers".
4. Write a designer diary about how your game "fixes" the existing game.
5. Serve hot.

Bottom line on this one, skip it.

I don't usually like to rate games as a "1" as most games truly don't deserve them, but I feel that I need to draw attention to the fact that David Sirlin, the designer of this game has behaved in ways that I find unacceptable and I think folks really should educate themselves before throwing money his way.

Mr. Sirlin's book, "Playing to Win" paints an extremely bleak portrait of what's going on in this guys head. What Sirlin's take on things essentially boils down to is that playing board and video games (read TOYS) should be a means of proving ones superiority over your friends and loved ones.  If you hold any other opinion, he's more than ready to tell you you're wrong.  He's told anyone who plays CCGs to leave his forums, nevermind if you're a fan of his work or a paying customer.  And then there's the whole part where he PLAGIARIZED someone else's work for the chip design in Puzzle Strike.

The following link, while humorous in nature, runs through the first chapter of Sirlin's book.  Jokes aside, take a look and ask yourself if you really want to encourage Sirlin any further.

I'm not telling anyone to not buy his games, but given that he is pretty much a one man operation, please keep in mind that you're truly voting with your dollars in this case.

His games entirely derivative anyway.

RATING: 6
Based on 1 play with 5 players:

I dig the betting system here and the way it ties into cost for card draws. That's what makes the game and the bluff aspect interesting and unique.

The special powers I'm not so sure on. Both the abilities you get to use at the end of a hand and the cards you can win seem superfluous and makes it feel like the design lacks elegance.

Being able to keep your cards between hands sounds like a cool idea on paper, but the reality is the cost to get a new hand is so low that ANYTIME you know you've given away information on your cards you're just going to refresh your hand, so it just feels like another unnecessary rule. Meh.

I'd play it again, but I'm not in any hurry.

Print and play edition.

Players participate in Panda Poker, playing through gambits, trying to amass the most gold.  Interesting Texas Hold'Em variant, played with a 61 card deck (6 suits, ranked 1-10, with a joker).  Bets are escalated through the flop, turn and river, and recorded on a private betting mat, so the history is there for all to see.  Interesting twists in that a hole card can be replaced by paying to the pot ("snacking") after the flop and turn, and each suit has an associated power that can be invoked before the showdown, allowing for some clever, tactical plays/bluffs.  The thing I really like is you keep your pocket cards for the next gambit, unless you win a hand, or pay to the next pot have them replaced ("breakfast").  The winner is the player with a certain amount of chips, based on number of players, after a gambit ends.

Clever, looks gorgeous, and plays well.  Can't wait for the real thing.

take my views with a pinch of salt because i got hammered at this, and i'm a little out of love with designer games atm anyways.

Its a bit like Texas holdem but with the betting notched down and the card play notched up. Without going in to detail you are very limited on how much you can bet, but you can change a card each turn. Couple this with the fact that you have 6 suits (1-10 each) you are going to go through a lot of cards making 4 of a kind and such high scores not uncommon. Its really a game about using bluff or luck to force the other players to pay to draw cards to meet their bets. Also the consequences for calling someones bluff, in a 2 player game at least, is pretty low.

Didn't mind it, might grow on me with more players. Probably prefer poker.

No idea what this is actually like other than the brief excited exclamation.... Poker with PANDAS! I got from the b/f.

Interesting if somewhat random poker variant. Immediately have introduced house rules as the 5x where x is number of players if someone calls you and you are not lying is far too much of a penalty, we also reduced the snacking to 1 gold per space below as two points per space was too much for what could be no gain at all. We also did not add in the panda lords aspect in our first game as it is so different from poker. 
I am really disappointed that they chose to oversize the cards as it is really difficult to shuffle the cards properly which is a fundamental aspect of the game.

Sold in 2016.

Very clever concept - or at least a very clever re-working of poker.  This adds much more game to poker, which really is no fun without money.  Pandante, on the other hand, is a great deal of fun if playing for nothing more than bragging rights during a lunch hour.  While I occasionally will play it, I don't love Texas Hold 'em, yet Pandante was still fun.  Don't be turned off from the gameplay unless you absolutely hate card games.

I really enjoyed playing this live online at pandante dot neocities dot org , while there was a critical mass of players there.  The bluffing is not huge, but deciding how high of a hand to claim (hoping to eventually get that hand) is like push-your-luck.

While learning (for your first few games) the rules may feel like there are too many little steps to do each round, breaking up the bluffing drama.  This will pass if you stick with the game.

Update:  I have not tried the new streamlined rules, but they definitely look better.

People who like Poker will dislike this, because it's actually pretty damn hard to learn and really exceptiony and annoying to play.

Let me make this *very* clear: I don’t like Poker. At all. I find it a pretty pointless game that people take too seriously and doesn’t serve any purpose because I don’t find it fun.

I know a lot of people like it. I know a lot of people sing its praises, but it’s just not for me.

Therefore, when Sirlin Games asked me if I wanted to playtest and review their game Pandante, I was a bit.. err… “meh!”. I was feeling that way because Pandante is, basically, Poker with a few bits and bobs added.

The bits and bobs added, though, turn it into a game that I was curious enough to actually say “yes, I’ll review it”.

Pandante is like Poker, but with lying, bluffing (no… bluffing more than in normal Poker) and abilities. And Pandas! Lots and lots of Pandas!

So I sat down with Michael Chamberlain and Max Murray in the review room and we played it. And we recorded our impressions.

If you are on time, you might want to head now to Kickstarter and back this project.

If you aren’t on time, you might want to get a copy… it’s been funded, so it should be available. 

If it isn’t available, get it from someone else. Just make sure you get this game.

Only had a handful of plays with this so far, but I really like what I see here. As a card player who has always HATED Poker this game improves on the model substantially- greater emphasis on bluffing/lying, fun restrictions on betting, player powers, etc. Standard Sirlin, in other words, which for me is a good, good thing. A bit more complicated than the cutesy pandas would have you believe; watch yourself breaking this out for families or hard-core Poker players, as both will struggle with some of the rules.

If you like Poker, you won't like this game because it's...not Poker.  If you don't like Poker, you still won't like this game because it doesn't really change the fundamental aspects of Poker in a meaningful way.  It also adds a lot of complexity for complexity's sake.  Our 1.5 hour game (complete with multiple rules explanations and conflicts between existing rules) dragged on and I found myself engineering ways to dump as much of my chips as possible into the pot in order to end the game more quickly.

A really cool re-imagination of Poker! However, I kind of think that it's a little too chaotic and each round has too many steps. I think if each round was a little bit quicker and I felt like there was a little bit more strategy (other than the lying/detecting lies part) I would enjoy it a lot more.  Too many special abilities for my taste.

Like it, but it took a little pride-swallowing to buy a Sirlin game.  It is basically a Texas-hold-em variant with a bit of theme thrown in.  Has a good player count, scales well with 6, and has high quality components. Not crazy about the "special ability" cards, as they tend to let one player run away with the game with a single win, but it is still a solid, fun poker game.

Pandante is a version of poker I actually kind of enjoy, however, at times it feels like the game is both actively encouraging and discouraging bluffing.

Not sure I've enjoyed the game at its highest level yet (too many noobs). On first glance, it's a marriage of Poker and Coup with a bunch of touch-ups to improve the Poker experience. Very neutral so far, and I'm seeing the game for its patches right now, not as a game. Importing the Coup / Liar's Dice element makes theoretical sense as another form of information control, but it still feels tacked-on.

1st Edition: Fun game. Design suffers a bit from lots of edge-case rules (tiebreakers, breakfast, etc.) and game scales weirdly due to challenges.

2nd Edition: Cleans up rules a lot, and Casino cards are fun. New ability phase is a trade-off. People get to do what they want, but I'm worried that there's a bit less emergent strategy. *Update: Think the trade-off is definitely worth it. Even the most reserved of my players end up agreeing. And there is still a bit of strategy in the abilities we still have.

Some complaints for 2nd edition still:

* Not a fan of the victory condition for casual games. Don't know what it "should be", but I don't like that once someone gets close to gold threshold they cannot win the game by lying against alert opponents, because it gets to a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation where you 100% have to challenge them. Maybe player elimination mode is just plain better even for casual games.

* I think the solution to "5 people challenged the hot seat and now owe him 150 gold" problem from 1st edition needed to be fixed, but making who gets the challenge money based on turn order feels weird.

A lot of people tout Sirlin's game design skills. On the basis of this game those people clearly have no idea what they are talking about. For one thing, this is strikingly unoriginal: it's a fairly standard Poker game combined with Coup. More importantly, it's not actually very good. I am not a big fan of hold-em Poker games (I prefer other kinds) but I would much rather play one of them than this, as all the extra hands and card-purchase options add little to the game and the fixed betting structure massively detracts from it. The suit powers aren't that interesting either.

RATING: 6.5
A perfect filler. The dice rolling mechanic is fun, the interaction is just assholish enough to give it a little zest, you can explain it in about a minute, and it doesn't overstay its welcome. All that and its super cheap too.

edit: dinged a bit after some sour games where no one could ever claim cards doe to bad rolls, and sometimes the game just doesn't end.

I played this game just twice, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Super simple dice game. Usually I'm not positively impressed by these, as they tend to be pretty much always the same, but I actually enjoyed Age of War more than I though I would. The reason might be that the dice rolling is paired with set collecting, which I like, and that there's also a little bit of conflict that spices things up some more.

A nice way to spend a few minutes between bigger games or waiting for other people to arrive. A good little game.

RATING: 7.5
Fun and uncommitting game in a tiny box, I'm not sure it would work well with the maximum player count as it may overstay its welcome, but with 3 to 4 players (my experiences so far)it proved to be a pleasant surprise ( perhaps that's the reason for the 7.5 instead of the, probaly more suitable, 6.5, but then its always nice to be pleasantly surprised:). It allows for a nice player interaction as you can conquer other players castles. bear in mind that it is pretty much Yahtzee, dice rolling pure and simple.

Very light abstract dice game. I bought it for the purpose of playing it at pubs. I think for that criteria it's good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is simple and fast. If I were to break down the involvement of the player, it is roughly 20% strategy and 80% chance. My wife beat me soundly her first time playing it, so skill is not essential. In fact, skill is not at all a factor in this game. Okay, it's probably 10% strategy and 90% chance, says this sore loser.

But it does not diminish the fact that this is a very easy game to learn, and very suitable for young kids to play. The "Ages 14+" rating insults the intelligence of the generation of the information age. I believe I might walk away licking my wounded ego after a 10 year old girl beat me soundly.

That said, this game introduces more interaction with more players. Rolling and attacking each others' conquered castle creates some groans and whining, which adds to the interaction value. However, too many players leaves potential opening to screen-time.

A Knizia, abstract, pasted-on-theme filler for sure. But you know what? It works. You roll dice to match symbols on a group of cards that you are both vying for. Collect sets of cards to get more points and whoever has the most points when all the cards are collected wins. A quick, fun filler.

Luck does factor into this one strongly, but it's a real enjoyable filler if you like dice placement and some competition. Supposed to be a re-skinning of the Risk Express game (which I've never tried), set in feudal Japan where you are rolling and re-rolling hands of dice to conquer fortresses for VP, with some slight bonuses for set collection. I've had a blast with it so far, and it's quite inexpensive.

The best part about this game is that you can play it while doing other things. For example, I'm visiting my brother and he is making breakfast. I take a turn and he only needs to listen to me emote about the results of my rolls to know exactly what is happening. He can come take a turn when he's ready and the game remains to be fun.

Very simple gameplay. 90%-98% luck-based on how good you roll. A plus is the quick set-up, the dice a good quality and feel nice to roll. The box can be easily ditched and the whole game can fit in a small d&d dice bag, or love-letter sized bag. This makes portability about as good as it gets. 

The game can take a bit long for all the luck involved. Think 30 minutes or more if everybody is rolling badly. Way too long for such a luck-based dice game. 

I would likely rate it higher if the games only took 5 minutes.

I can't help but think about tinkering with this game every time I play. Probably the only Knizia's game where I thought that it is "too slim" mechanically and my gut is telling me it is because of a lack of mechanism that pushes the game towards it's end (as opposed to Pickomino and Sushizock where this mechanism exists). Despite this, there is great potential in this game, evidenced in popularity of Elder Sign.

Sold since I would rather play Pickomino.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Elder signs, but not co-op?  I thought this would actually be kind of fun, and while I did do poorly, I didn't have very much fun with this one.  I think this type of game works better as a Co-op, and would rather play Elder Signs than this one.  Even though it wasn't very long (probably took us 30min with 4?), felt like it dragged on.  Not something I am really looking forward to playing again.  Won't be keeping this one long.

The kids liked it. I felt it was okay. You pretty quickly figure out which combos to take first and then it just becomes a wait for the combo to hit. The actual game is in the castles/clans that you choose to take and when. ...It felt kind of repetitive. I'm hoping it will grow on me.

Ok I am rating this without playing but I already know this will be a hit in my group as they love chucking dice in games like King of Tokyo and Zombie Dice.  I also wanted to rate this because I see a lot of N/A which is BS as it drags the ratings down and makes people not want to buy the game.  So my initial rating will be a 7.5. 

Ok I am updating...This game is great!  I have played it probably 15 times now and with 2,3 and 4 people and have really enjoyed it with all numbers.  It is a great filler after coming off of a big long game. Upping my rating!!

Knizia at his best: a stripped down ruleset that reveals more than initially meets the eye. Game play is reminiscent of Elder Sign, but the competitive nature and the opportunity for trash talk appeals much more to me. A tiny bit of strategy is also involved. All in all, a very enjoyable filler.

RATING: 6
It may be that with more plays this game takes on a more interesting aspect, as for now it unfortunately lacks something. I am a bug fan of many a Knizia game, and think Ra: the Dice Game is probably one of the best dice games I've played, but Age of War just lacked options. Once you lock yourself into a castle there seems little to do but roll and hope for the best, an option to fill more than one line, or attack more than one castle at a time may have made the game more interesting (I'm sure there are good reasons why these aren't options), but frankly the game just feels too lucky. 

This lucky feeling seems to come from the fact that you can only claim one row at a time, and that once you are locked into attacking a castle, you must continue to do so - both these have the net result that after the first roll, you are rolling and hoping for the best, any subsequent action lacks choice. May try again and see if there are aspects or rules I'm missing - fingers crossed.

Typical Knizia dice game: all the mechanics of other fun dice games minus all the fun.

The biggest problem with this game is that there are far too many failed rolls from player to player, so ten minutes could potentially go by with no one taking any castle cards. This means the "20 minutes" time listed on the box might stretch to "30" or "40" depending on player luck roll. This is far too long for a dice game, and makes something that should be fun and light into something boring and tedious.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on 1 play with 4 players:

This is a game that will live forever on in our group's collective heart, as our first play was one of our most bizarre gaming experiences ever.

But first, I'll talk about the game. You roll some dice. Literally that's all there is. The decisions are nothing if not straightforward, so you just roll some dice.

The dice are gorgeous though, FWIW.

What we got out of it, however, is not a game but an [i]experience[/i]. Let me be clear: the game did nothing to bring out this experience for us, we brought it ourselves. And it was magical.

So it started when the first turn of the game, my boyfriend, a notoriously poor roller, managed to get one of the best territories in the game. On the second turn, the next player in line managed to steal it from him.

I should at this point mention that it was the end of the night, about 12:30 in the morning, none of us had played before, and we wound up with two spectators. So there were six people standing and sitting around a table watching the events unfold.

When it came back around to my boyfriend's turn, it started small. "A double horse", someone said, "is all you need for that card." "Double horse!" someone shouted, as the active player picked up the dice. "Double horse! Double horse!" Slowly, the crowd began to roar. As mob mentality took over, all that was left but our furious shouting. The double horse. [i]He had to roll it[/i].

He did not, of course.

The player to my immediate right began to average 1 castle a turn. The player across from me was intermittently grabbing them. My boyfriend and I were still stuck with nothing.

The chants of "double horse!" as my boyfriend continued to fail to get [i]anything[/i] turn after turn, and everyone leaning in, staring at me, and saying, like it was the easiest task in the world, "One bow's all you need. It's just one bow. All you need is one bow. Mandy, just one bow. Easy-peezy." *Rolls 4 dice, no bows* "Mandy, it's nothing. It's just one bow. Just one bow. One bow." * Rolls 3 dice, no bow* "All you need is one bow. You can do it anytime you want." - *2 dice, no bow* - "Just one bow. that's all ya need. Nothin' to it." *1 die, 1 bow* - "See? Easy." happening [i]five turns in a row[/i] netting me all 5 yellow castles, will live on forever in my memory.

And, best of all, the game ended when my boyfriend got the LAST property - worth 1 point.

We were all in tears.

It's just a dice-rolling, chance-taking game, so makes for a fun pub game. No real skill involved, but some strategy for sure. We usually end up rooting for and helping each other :)

*5* (Initial Plays)
I'll preface this with I am not usually a fan of dice rollers. This one wasn't bad and it wasn't great. It is quick to play and has some decision making with what to conquer allowing for a little interaction. In the end, the game is highly dependent on the outcomes of the dice, but one could play probabilities to limit risk. Good game to play every now and then to fill time.

I enjoy it, but feel as it relies too much on the luck of the roll. Better than Roll for It, since it has the Set Collect mechanic but you are now able to steal from other people as well.

RATING: 5
The dice mechanics are pretty much the same as seen in Elder Signs. That's just about all there is to the game really, match dice with the card and it is yours. You can also steal other players cards from them. Not much else to say really, if you really love Elder Signs and would like a quicker, less complicated version this might be for you. Otherwise there are better games out there

I bought this on a whim and because it was inexpensive, but ended up really liking it. Pros are it's compact and super easy to teach while still requiring some skill. The biggest negative for me was 4 play games tended to drag on a little longer than ideal. 2 player games have been short and fun, while 4 players lasted a little longer but was a bit more strategic.

Az Elder Sign mechanizmusa (kockákkal dobunk max 3-szor és próbáljuk kidobni azokat a szimbólumokat amik a kártyákon vannak), kompetitív játékra berendezve. Várakat kell elfoglani, amiket mindaddig egymástól is el lehet foglalni, ameddig valaki az összes egyszínűt meg nem szerezte. Ha már nincs mit elfoglani, pontozunk. Előnye, hogy nagyon gyorsan bele lehet ugrani: kirakod az összes kártyát és már kezdhettek is dobálni. Hátránya, hogy ennyi a játék. Időnként azért szórakoztató, ha a társaság tolerálja az ilyen kvázi szerencsejátékokat és a helyén kezeli.

I like dice games, and this gets a solid 8 from me, based solely on solo play so far. It is a fast filler game, that has that 'just one more go' attraction. There is luck, obviously, as this is a dice game, but there are decisions you have to make - e.g. which line do you complete, and how does that affect your chances of completing the rest of the card, with the reduced number of dice? I've also created a solitaire opponent variant which seems to be quite fun and challenging.

A game of set collection and press-your-luck where you claim castles that are a part of sets using dice. You can steal castles from others with a bit more difficulty so long as they don't have the entire set locked down. The art and quality are strong, but the game runs afoul in its potentially never-ending loop of trading castles back and forth. Not bad, but not great.

Bought with "Hey, That's My Fish!" as part of a BOGO sale. Definitely the weaker of the two - a push-your-luck type of game that's a bit more shallow than some of the others I own of the same type (Dungeon Roll and King of Tokyo, for example). Beautiful cards and dice - theme is wonderful, too. Possibly worth it just for that.

RATING: 5
Very approachable dice rolling Knizia game which could have a lot of appeal for Yahtzee families.   There is no dice mitigation, so whoever rolls best will do better.   It's as simple as that.  The only real choice in the game is which card to go for.   And you have to decide early on, so after that...  just roll well.   Not a fan of the coarse scoring, but the set collecting and locking of cards is a nice idea.  Perhaps a little long for what it is.

Huge Knizia fan, but this one failed to appeal to me too much. Bit of fun in the dice rolling, and deciding which cards to go for, but every play I've had has resulted in some players 'phasing out' mid game, due to functionless rolls or inevitable loss.

Push your luck Yahtzee style dice game with nice feudal Japan theme. You have to conquer different castles possibly making set collection by conquering all of the castles of one clan (color), locking them from other players attacks.

It's quick, it's Knizia, but otherwise not that replayable, nor too much fun game in the end.

Its nice and light and also manages to Avoid what I hated about most dice related small games. 
What you roll on the dice and if you should roll more is not the choice you are making like in zombie dice, dino dice etc...
In this game you are choosing what to do and the dice are deciding your level of success, you can scheme what you are going to attempt and make sets for bonus points. 
Printing is really good as expected from FFG.

Roll dice, choose card & fill a row of matching symbols, roll dice to fill remaining rows of chosen card. There's a slight tactical element to card selection, but that's about it.

Perhaps it works better as a children's game.

A great little dice-chucker that gets a lot of play (as Risk Express) at my kids' school game club. Age of War, which I subsequently purchased for home, is nice-looking and is shirt-pocket small (when removed from the box). I liked the world geography of Risk Express, but the theme here is certainly more interesting, and someday I may create a map of feudal Japan onto which to lay the cards.

Nem szép dolog az árral kezdeni a véleményt, de itt nem tudom megállni. Valami döbbenetes: 7 kocka és 14 kártya van a dobozban, mindez 4-5k közötti áron. OMG.
Maga a játék gyakorlatilag egy egyszerűsített, konfrontatív elder sign. Elvileg fun játék, ami gyorsan lepörgethető. Ennek nekem kicsit ellentmond a vár elvevés lehetősége, ami azért szinte nullázza valakinek a játékát, így logikusan a szórakozás rovására megy erősen. Azért nem olyan rossz filler, de van jobb szerintem.

[2014.10.10] - 7.0
The first play was a lot of fun.  The nature of the PYL was such that it had a good amount of tension.  We didn't play any take-aways however.

[2015.70.20]

Over time the fairly straight-forward "recipe-matching" dice games have tarnished for me.  In this particular sub-genre, AoW doesn't have enough to it to sustain.  That said, it's a nice way to pass the time while waiting for food at a restaurant.

Little dice game of conquering castles with different dice results. 

I thought the endgame would be drawn out, but it works out that one or two people can win by taking the last card on the table, while other players need to take cards from each other. It actually made the decisions easier, and made the game work.

But you do have a lot of turns where you get nothing, and you don't feel like you are progressing. So large parts of the game can feel futile.

This is a perfectly passable filler game that works fine with lots of players as there is very little downtime. As push-your-luck dice games go, it's a refreshing change from the "roll three times" genre that is so prevalent. There is a decent amount of player interaction in trying to take other people's stuff, but it doesn't feel terribly nasty or anything. It looks nice on the table, and is available at a good price, which is fitting considering how few components there are. Ultimately, I'm generally happy to play this and it will stay on my shelf, but my collection would be fine without it as well.

It's a much simpler Elder Sign. Purely filler material here, not astounding but fun for the most part. Some games can take longer than need be when players want to attack others castles.

I usually like luck-pushing games, but Age of War falls flat for me. The decisions about luck made in this game aren't as enjoyable because the margins for error are extremely slim. Too many turns all but force players into going for something that isn't ideal (usually centering around collecting a full set). That makes it feel like one has to get really lucky to get a big payout. That, combined with the ability to fall behind further after being the victim of theft, can make the game play out in a very unsatisfying manner. There is probably a good game in here somewhere, but as is, it's a pass for me.

Initial Rating: 3.5 (September 2014)

I had some hopes for Age of War (cool name), however it ended up disappointing me so I’m getting rid of it ASAP.

It is VERY light, has no meaningful decisions, a lot of uncontrollable luck, paper thin theme, very few components  and it is very boring. The game is gorgeous (great art) and the dice are good but the gameplay is awful. To be fair I had fun the second time I played it so it is very group dependent. I think it can be a good game to introduce new gamers to our hobby. It plays (more or less) fast and can be explained under one minute.

The plastic wrapping box was very hard to open. I could not open it with my bare hands, I used a blade and I had to destroy it but he game comes in a much smaller box. Weird, why not just ship the box?

Bottom line, I don’t think I will ever play it again, I feel there is no point. It is way too light for my taste. I vastly prefer Roll for It in this category (which is a surprise for me). Knizia disappoints again.

Age of War packs quite a punch for a small game. Sure, it's a dice game so there is a healthy dose of luck, but there are enough decisions and tactics for a satisfying experience. The design choice of having clans takes the game to the next level by adding tension and interaction. Without this feature, the game wouldn't be nearly as fun. Great artwork, quality custom dice, and a low price tag make this a hit at my house!

Age of War, like most dice games, is heavily dependent on the luck of the roll.  That being said, there's a couple other things here at work that make it more than just luck.  Being able to choose your goals as well as being able to go after other players take this to the next level.  An enjoyable filler that lasts just long enough to remain fun without getting too old too quick.

Cool little filler game, using dice rolling and then using what you have rolled to beat cards and gain points then the second half of the game is attacking other peoples cards to take them, once you get of the same colour they cannot be taken.

You roll dice way too many times for relatively few to no meaningful decisions.  I prefer games with the Yahtzee style dice rolling as your rolls are limited to three and choosing what to re-roll has more meaning.
With zero ways to influence your die rolls the game also becomes tedious and far too long for what it is at times.  A similar enough but far better dice game is Las Vegas.

Fun at fist, then it starts dragging. As all the other Knizia dice games I've played, it has serious end-game issues, as games just go on and on and on. Indeed, they drag until someone decides enough is enough and ends the game, crowning whoever has the lead as victor. Would've rated it much higher if it could be consistently finished in 10 minutes or less.

This is one of the many simple Knizia dice games, combined with a little set collection. I have never played Risk Express but I can see how the card (and even symbol) distribution was even better for the theme of world domination. I can see why all the cards/continents had to be conquered in a game that had the Risk name on its packaging but if FFG really wanted to rerelease the game with a different theme, it would have been wise to change the endgame condition somewhat, because out of 7 plays the game had a very drawn-out endgame 2 times.
Well, even with these problems, I enjoy the game pretty much...

I have played this game a couple of times so far.  I really enjoy the theme of this game and has the same feel of Roll For It, but with some twists.  However, this game can be very frustrating if you don't get the rolls you need.  But, this is a short/filler game, so its not that big of a deal.

Could be playbale solitaire as variant. Comparable to elder sign. Choice seems obvious according to comments. After a video review, it's really elder sign, but you collect cards for VP and try to make sets of cards for bigger VP. The multiplayer interaction is to steal other player's castle.  I guess it could be playable as a solitaire, but you'll have to create some sort of threath to work against.

Il s'agit du Risk Express relooké au temps des samurai. Le thème est plus sympa, mais la petite piste de dés en plastique du Ris Express me manque beaucoup.

RATING: 7
Simple dice rolling game where you match dice to a battle line on a castle.  If you are able to match all the dice to battle lines before you dice run out, you capture the castle and the victory points associated with the castle.  Other players can take your castle if they defeat the same battle lines plus one more with another Daimyo.  If you get all castles of the same color, you flip the castles over and they are safe and provide all victory points plus a bonus of one or two.  When all castles are captured, the game is over.  

Not a deep game, but it does provide for good decisions and when you pull off a capture of a castle it can be very exciting. It is a good filler.  It can run a little long for what it is if you get a lot of bad rolls, but it it will never last more than 40 min.

On the fence about trading this away.  Very random with no way to mitigate dice rolls.  Also, the game can go on for over 40 minutes, the end coming down to each player rolling symbols that do not work and passing the dice.  Frustrating.  Somewhat boring.  However, it is one of the few games that my spouse will play with me, so I'll probably keep it.

For two I'd rather play Tales and Game: The Hare and Tortoise for the same length of time.  For more, I'd rather play no thanks or 6 Nmmt.

RATING: 5
Very light dice rolling and set collection game.  Players are warlords in feudal Japan.  On their turn players will roll 7 dice in an attempt to match icons on cards laid out in the middle of the table.  The cards represent castles within regions of the country.  Each castle is worth various amounts of points.  Collect all the castles within the same region and players will earn extra points.  Once all the castles have been collected the points are tallied, and whomever has the highest score wins.

This should be a filler game.  It should be quick.  However, since players are completely at the mercy of the dice rolls, without any way to modify the results, it could take a long time to play.  On your turn you roll all 7 dice, then you choose a card that you are going to try for by placing whatever dice match a row of symbols on the card.  There are between 1 and 4 rows of symbols on any give card.  You don't have to do them in order, but you can only do one row at a time even if you have the symbols to do more.  Every time you have an unsuccessful roll you eliminate one of the dice, and roll again.  You do this until either you get all the rows of symbols that you need, or you run out of dice.

It's a good game if you want something pretty mindless to fill time, say during a lunch break at work.  However, it's pretty repetitive, and can take much longer than you bargained for.

This is a super light dice-rolling game that requires little to no strategy. I often play this with co-workers at lunch who don't game much because the game is easy to teach and understand, and doesn't take up too much time or table space. I really like the set collection aspect of collecting the castles of the same color, but this can often cause the game to drag on as players are often trying to steal castles of one color from each other. I'll be holding onto this game for a little while as a game to bring out with non-gamers or something to do while we wait for friends to arrive to a scheduled game session.

Preliminary rating after a couple of plays. There isn't much here either thematically or mechanically but what is here is fun and accessible. I think it needs a time limit or a group who is willing to call the game when they get bored (as it stands the endgame could run indefinitely if the dice don't cooperate) but for $10 I got a portable, easy-to-teach dice game that my wife really likes and that plays six. That's a win.

This game is a retheme of Risk Express set in feudal Japan though, like most Reiner Knizia games, it could be set in Smurfland for all the difference the pasted-on theme would have to game play.

I played Age of War at a local games store (Jolt Games in Mitchell) with Little Fish the Elder and it went over reasonably well. As you’d expect, it’s all about dice rolling and making an informed(ish) decision based on what the dice give you and which of the 14 provinces are still up for grabs. The little chap enjoyed the game and wanted to play again immediately afterwards which is a good sign. It’s no brain-burner but is good silly fun.

As Age of War doesn’t come with the ‘roll bowl’ that Risk Express boasts (and is in a very small box) it retails for cheap and might just find its way into an Xmas present for the Little Fish.

Puntos fuertes: Buena presentación, transportable, barato, dados de buena calidad y originales, fácil de aprender y para todos los públicos. Se le puede sacar a cualquiera. Está muy bien la posibilidad de fastidiar a los demás jugadores, aunque no haya interacción realmente entre ellos.

Punto débil: Se hace monótono. Es para una o dos partidas. A más de 3 jugadores se puede hacer un poco pesado. 

Conclusión: Un buen "Push your luck", un juego de azar entretenido, de viaje y buen juego para una sobremesa. No necesariamente para jugones.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/RrWw3X9mWEY

Age of War is a dice rolling game from Reiner Knizia. It is a similar mechanic to Roll for it, Elder sign and fuse where you are rolling dice to match certain symbols on a card. The big problem I had with this is it's just a bit boring with little player interaction. Roll for it had me more invested and fuse and Elder Sign add so much more to the mechanic so there's no room for this in my collection.

Replaces Elder Sign for me.

Additional fan rules:

After failing to capture a castle you receive a lock token, allowing you to lock a die after rolling dice to capture a castle. It is discarded after use.

After an unsuccessful atempt at capturing a neutral castle, rotate it 90 degrees. That castle is under siege and goes into revolt when rotated 360 degrees. Castles in revolt are removed from the centre and require the additional daimyo battle line fulfulled to be captured.

After conquering a clan, you receive as many reroll tokens as there are castles in that clan. Each token allows you to reroll one die.

Post Elder Sign, this looks like a ripoff, but it's actually just a rethemed Risk Express (which never came out in the USA). The game is so simple, but it manages to turn most dice rolls into suspenseful moments. The take-that aspect recalls Pickomino (which is the better game overall). This mechanic keeps the game interesting throughout, preventing runaway leaders, but potentially threatens to push the game's play time past filler status as the same cards go back and forth.

Have to say I was extremely underwhelmed.  After 15 minutes of back and forth we had only managed to conquer one territory.

At that point we basically just started dropping the dice because we had lost interest as the whole thing seemed futile.

Then just packed it up.  

Seems like a lazy game.  I might play it with younger kids who might find the easy rules and randomness easier to handle, or perhaps on a boring plane trip.  

I had to lower my rating after giving this game another try. I pulled it out hopefully for a quick light game later in the evening. 30 minutes in, we're still fighting over the last couple of territories that neither player could roll the right combos for. Went from frustration to complete disinterest before packing it back up.

It's a blatant copy of Elder Sign, without the cooperative stuff + a nice mechanism to make stealing more difficult.

The aim is to win castles, and each castle has a series of combos you need to roll, one by one (using only the dice remaining after each roll) to win it and claim its points. So roll, and pick the castle that has one of the combos you rolled and which gives you the best chance to get the remaining combos (or shoot for a harder castle for higher points if you're keen). Then hope you get lucky, because with each miss you lose one dice and one miss is usually fatal as the odds get vanishingly smaller with each roll missed. And that's it - there's nothing clever you can do, no dice manipulation. You just roll, and roll, and hope you get lucky. The ability to target a castle someone else has already won (you need an extra "daimyo" result to claim it, so it's harder) just makes the game go longer and introduces a king-making element to boot. The game really didn't need any more downsides. A poor, lazy design by my reckoning.

Good, fast, classy, press-your-luck dice chucker from Knizia! I dare say that this is a modern day classic that belongs in every home, whether in this form or as Risk Express. MUCH MUCH MUCH better than Roll For It. Okay for 2 players; better with more players.

RATING: 7
I really like the idea of this and the game is decent, but you are really limited in decisions once you pick a territory.

Once you decide where to attack, you are stuck attacking the province (card) you selected. It feels limited in that sense.

Keeping focus on what your opponent needs and selecting what province (card) to go after is really the only important decisions here.

A very teeny game. 7 dice and 14 cards. Will probably take when traveling.

Update- the ending of a 4P game made the game a lot more exciting that the 2P game. It goes up to a 7 or 8 with more players.

Based on one play: This is just a lot of dice rolling with basically no strategy. You roll and then try to capture cards. To do so you must, at each roll, complete a set. If you can get all the sets before you run out of dice, you get the card. If you can't fill a set on one roll, you lose a dice and roll again. You can steal cards already capture (with one extra set required) and capturing all the cards of one color makes them safe from stealing and gets you a bonus point or two. Just roll dice and hope for the best, not a game in my opinion.

RATING: 5
Not bad for a fun little time waster. It would be better if the cards had powers on them.  I have not played Pickimono, but Age of War and Pickimono have very similar dice mechanics, though it appears Pickimono does it better.  Still, Age of War is a fun 15 minutes or so.  I will say that even though the box is small, it is still too big considering the components.  I threw the box away and combined Sushizock and Age of War in the same box.

Total dicefest. You just throw your dice and try out the best castle, based on your probabilities. No dice management, no special powers, no nothing. Pure luck. First player gets the advantage of playing more turns. Trailing players have no incentive to advance the game-state by taking castles from the center of the table, thus prolonging an already boring game. I like the theme, though.

There's the framework for a great game here, but every time it's an exercise in frustration.  I've seen over a dozen turns go by with nobody conquering anything, despite that players have rolls that are a good fit for their targets.  This gets even worse as the game nears its end and few good territories are available.

My enthusiasm for this decreases with each play.  Some strategy in figuring out probability, but still too much luck (And I like dice games). The end game can really drag on as people steal cards to prevent the leader from grabbing that last card.

A very, very stripped down version of Elder Signs...which isn't a bad thing, but definitely relegates it to filler status.  Can be a little hostile and drawn out at the end (especially trying to conquer the yellow provinces), but it does add to the tension when you're trying desperately to roll that one last daimyo to take your opponent's card.  
I personally enjoyed this one quite a lot.  It isn't particularly novel or difficult, but sometimes simple can be fun.  And, really, you can't beat the price.  I've had more expensive hamburgers, and those weren't half as good of a time.   

Edit:  One point of contention I didn't mention: the packaging is wasteful in the extreme.  Clamshell casings make sense when you're trying to keep people from shoplifting an iPod or something of the sort, but it has no business being on a $12 game.  I appreciate they want to be able to hang it up on posts in local game stores, but I just can't see that justifying the plastic.  I docked a point for this because it really didn't sit well with me, so if you're unbothered by it, you could logically adjust my score upward.

A fast, simple dice game. I like that it's very easy to explain and jump into, with a nice mix of luck and meaningful decisions. It's definitely not a "main event" kind of game, but it's so fast that it works well as a filler. It can have an awkward end game though, with players trading one or two final castles back and forth until the dice favor one of them and let them win outright.

Especially compared to Can't Stop, this game does nothing. There are a handful of games that do a mix of this with Can't Stop, and from my experience, if you want a thematically pleasing dice-rolling game with some mitigation in the form of stopping, there's the Mars Attacks Dice Game. Way better. Still, get Can't Stop, or Incan Gold/Diamant.

Pros:
* Quick setup

* Works well for 2
* Dice chucking goodness
* The ability to steal (and protect) cards adds just the right level of interaction.

Cons:
* I hate square cards! Fortunately, you never need to shuffle these.
* Not much here. Something you might play many times in quick succession and then put back on the shelf for another year.

We've played this over a dozen times and it's a good game. There are a couple cards which seem disproportionately difficult to acquire and sometimes the game will bog down at the end.

Ultimately, this game was replaced in our collection by Pickomono.

Light filler where players roll dice, yahtzee style. 
Each time you roll the dice, you match them to a row on a village card.  Fill in all rows with your dice to capture the village.  Don't match any village rows on the card you attack, discard one dice and try again.
Obtain all the village cards in one colour to solidify your hold, otherwise other players can take them from you.

Why is this in my collection.
Quick yahtzee style game which is easier than king of tokyo as there are no special power cards etc.  I guess making this my yahtzee gateway game.

In Age of War, players take turns rolling dice in order to conquer districts in Japan. Once a district has dice placed on it, players have to commit the rest of the rolls for that turn to winning that district, a row at a time.

The decisions mostly come down to which card to commit to at the first roll since you are rewarded for collecting sets of districts; subsequent rolls are merely playing the odds. Player interaction is minimal despite the lure of stealing opponents' districts, and the game drags a little as you can only watch on during opponents' turns. Not a flawed game by any means, but there's hardly anything compelling about it either.

A light "Yahtzee-style" dice rolling game that works as a nice filler. There is a easily missed rule that was not properly pointed out: If you conquer a castle (and it hasn't completed/conquered a specific clan), then that card is still active and can be conquered by opposing players. To conquer a castle from another player, an opponent must not only fill in all the battle lines, but they must also fill the special daimyo shown at the top left corner of the card.

This game exists because of that one friend out of the four you invited to your board game night got caught up in traffic or some other excuse and would be running late. Also, since he's late anyway, you asked him to go drop by 7-eleven for some chips, beer, and ice cubes. 

This game brings joy and happiness to everyone... especially right after that tardy friend of yours arrives.

This was OK, nothing special to see here. You're rolling some dice for some set collection and there is a little press-your-luck in what you get. I still think Martian Dice scratches the same itch at a far faster gameplay, and given the length needed for this one, I'll pass.

Great filler/intro game takes less then 2 minutes to explain the whole game. Tried a variant where if the first roll each turn fills a card that you take it, decided to allow the rule only on a players first roll of the game, it speeds up the initial captures.

I remembered liking this a lot (when it was Risk Express), but found it a bit under-whelming now. Very minimal choices or tension; just roll and hope to match the symbols you need. Still an entertaining filler.

Press your luck filler game.  It definitely fits the classic Reiner pasted on theme type of game.  It reminds me a lot of Martian Dice with more player interaction (which is good).  With the right group of people it can be quite enjoyable and cutthroat when someone goes to try to steal your hard earned points. This would easily hit the table when we need a 20 minute filler.

Oddly, the Japanese theme is even weaker than the Risk Express theme was - perhaps because it was more obvious - but AoW is a good and straight forward re-printing of that hard to get game.

Not sure why this is even a game.  Dice games are not my thing, but I can play some of them if there is something else going on to compensate.  But this is simply: if you roll what you need, you win; if you don't, then you lose. Why not just get a single die, and take turns rolling it and the first to have rolled a 6 three times wins - you would have played a game with equivalent depth but at least saved some money.

RATING: 6.5
PROS: •Fairly entertaining luck-based game. Although the strategies are easy to master, the game offers more decision-making than most push-your-luck games. You need to decide between things like: trying a "hard" location in order to complete a set; trying a location that my opponent needs to keep him from completing a set; trying to steal from opponents; Trying an easy location even if that card may be easily stolen afterwards... The end condition also should be kept in mind: As soon as the table is empty, the game ends and players score. So if you are winning, you want to get locations from the table. If you are losing, you need to get locations from your opponents unless you can surpass them only by conquering what is left at the table. You also should consider the different probabilities on the dice and their result combinations. These decisions make for a quite interesting and short casual game. •Small box. •Cool artwork. •Every set has its a symbol, color and name, and each location has a name and different art. For a game so abstract, this effort wasn't even necessary but I'm glad they did it.

CONS: •The game can take longer that it would be "ideal" for a game this casual. Of course we can house-rule: "At every first roll of every turn, if you have everything required to completely fill and conquer a location, you can. Otherwise, proceed gameplay as normal". •The colours used on the dice carvings are darker and different from the cards, could be better. •Not a big fan of the beige-coloured dice.

OVERALL: The game would be a 8.5 for casual / party gamers if the variant rule I described was an official rule. That would be it's maximum rating, because in my arbitrary rating system, a game so simple can never be a 9 or 10. And for those who complain that the theme is non-present, well.. Still better than 100% abstract with colours os shapes, in my opinion. If only every abstract had a wash of theme and cool artwork...

I can't rate a stupid dice game higher than 7 even though it achieves exactly what it set out to do.

The mechanic of removing one die after each of your rolls is very fun.  You begin an assault on a castle with a fistfull of dice, feeling unstoppable.  Then, upon failing your first roll, the weight of dice in your hand is substantially lighter, and you are afraid....  Connecting the physical dice with the mechanic is very smart.  It's things like this that Knizia does in order to SQUEEZE the most possible game out of something that should be nothing.  Knizia just gets it.

A wonderful shoot-the-shit game for the bar.

Very light dice game with a single mechanic (like Elder Sign / Roll for It), which I like, but it does not offer anything else...

[+] easy to teach, small box, fast paced, push-your-luck
[+] no way to mitigate the luck of the rolls, I wish there was a bit more to it (each castle could grant you a power when you have it, like reroll 1 dice, set 1 dice to some face... but then when you complete a series of castles you flip them gaining more points but losing the powers)

Components are nice, and art is fantastic, but gameplay is very boring.  Decisions are infrequent and straightforward, and luck factor is high enough that there's very little control.  Confrontation is discouraged, but crippling if it succeeds.  This game is boring and dry like a bad Euro, and luck-driven and chaotic like bad Ameritrash.  Avoid this one.

Really tight, neat, simple but competitive, strategic and tactical little dice game. I like the theme and i like the flow and the ability to steal already stolen buildings and add the extra stress of attaining all of one color to prevent stealing and garner extra points makes for a nice, short, fun, filler. Though Random and apt to lucky dice roles giving an advantage, the dice mechanic allows for plenty of room for adaption, though after deciding placement, those choices dwindle with each roll, which is why it's so great.

My son liked it so much that i can't, in full honesty, leave this to a 5. I raise it to a 6 just because it is fast, light and gives some fun, at least to younger gamers.


----------------
Played in 3, quite disappointing.
To be honest, during the first half an hour it was fun to conquer cards but then, it just dragged forever in a dead end where the winning player tries to conquer Odani (10 katanas) and the others try to steal from him a yellow card. It got extremely boring.
For the math fans, the probability to have at least 10 Katanas with the initial 7 dice is exactly 57780/279936, that is, almost 20%. During all the assault you got almost 34% chances to conquer Odani. I never managed to get it while i was on the lead and then we decided to stop the boring game

This a fun and easy game to play. Once you play a few games it goes fast. I like dice game so for me it was a good buy.

Not much fun. I've only played with 2 players, it might be better with more.

This game was surprisingly difficult. I thought it would take only a few minutes, but it goes on for quite some it. It is MUCH harder to match the tiles than you'd expect. Good thing it was a cheap game though.

Nice light game that can make a good filler and has an interesting dice placement mechanism. However, bad dice rolls can make the game drag on far, far too long if you insist on continuing to play to winning conditions.

It's funny to see complaints that Age of War is a ripoff of Elder Sign (released 2011) when it's a straight-up reprint of Risk Express (released 2006), which never had a US release.  Know your history, dudes.

Like: Surprisingly fun dice game. Always that last symbol on the last roll moments.

Dislike: While not completely luck based, a lucky person can sweep.

This is a dice game heavy with luck (yes, mentioning dice was the first clue) and a splash of strategy. While I am not usually one that likes games that rely so heavily on luck, I find the game somewhat enjoyable (and I am a sucker for feudal Japan themed games). I wouldn't hesitate to pull out this game if a filler game was needed.

Perhaps the best push-your-luck game I've yet played. There actually is a strong strategic component to play, and the game is both engaging and fiercely competitive.

I didn't really enjoy this one so much. It was an easy filler dice game but there didn't feel like many interesting decisions. The dice were lovely though.

Simple but fun dice filler that can be played in 10-15 minutes, perfect for traveling. Fast set-up and lots of fun conquering the japanese Edo palaces. Same dice mechanics as Elder Sign but simplified. Enjoyable.

Fun little filler dice game.  Not sure how well it might scale with larger player numbers, but works well as a two player game.  Some direct conflict, but nothing too aggressive.

Very quick filler that reminds me of the Elder Sign mechanics. Nice components (FFG never disappoint), but, in my opinion, an excessively simple game.

Hra vůbec není špatná. Jako každá kostková hra, je hlavně o štěstí, ale možnost  ukořistit již dobytý hrad to trošku kompenzuje. Grafika je pěkná a atmosféru starého Japonska i navodí.

Decent at lower player counts.  For higher counts you just don't get enough turns to strategise.  Obviously all up to the dice at any count.

Idióta dicefest, egy Japán témájú kockapóker, de vmiért nem rossz. Mondjuk kicsit talán hosszú, rossz dobások esetén baromira elhúzódhat és unalmassá válik, ez mindenképpen nagy hátránya. Hármasban és kettesben is működik egymás támadása, nyilván minél többen vagytok, annál viccesebb lehet.

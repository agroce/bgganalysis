Very tactical -- it's essentially a chess variant, but with no long-ranging pieces. It reminds me of two other chess variants -- Makruk (Thai Chess), because of the limited range of the pieces, and Smess, because pieces can be threatened without being able to return the threat.

 Played a couple dozen games over 25 years - recently bought the game with the intention of introducing to kids under 10 this summer . With the bright colored pieces and fairly quick play ( I have not timed games , but I don't think it plays any longer than 1/2 hour with 2 players ) I figure if I can get them to finish one game , they'll like it . If not , at least I like it .

I find this to be a nice abstract strategy game, although it's as difficult as chess to play in my opinion.  There are certain times when you really need to look ahead and see what the logical conclusion to your move is without rotation, since sometimes, you can't retreat to the same place you originated from.

I like this chess variant. And yet, it's been so long since I've played this game using the original rules. For some reason, my brother and I borrowed rules from other games such as Camelot.

Ploy reads pretty much like chess with a twist, but once it's on the table it doesn't take long to realise that a completely different approach is needed -the task of "opening up the game" by giving some variety to the movement of the pieces is very elegantly tackled; their difference in reach makes for a quicker pace exchanging pieces than in other games of the style, and while the rotation isn't as decisive at the opening, it gets more and more important towards the end, sometimes bringing very surprising closes for the regular chess player.

While not as profound or fleshy as chess, Ploy is shorter and far more accessible while still being reasonably difficult; it's definitely not a mere "chess variation", but a crisp, clever creation that stands on its own and always delivers. Therefore a perfect choice to get someone started into abstract games of the heavier kind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an old 3M abstract game with chess-like mechanics. You must capture the enemy's Commander to win, and each piece has special movement rules. Had this game caught on, it would undoubtedly be as analyzed and discussed as games like chess are. We played 2-player and it played really fast, likely because we didn't know what we were doing. It's easy to learn and play, and it was pretty enjoyable. I actually found it kind of thematic due to the flying saucer-like pieces and the retro/futuristic game board.

I think this game is a bit under-rated by many.  I like the futuristic feel (better than Terrace and smaller too!) and game play.  I find hard choices come in the mid-game, where you undoubtedly have to start thinking about trading in pieces (i.e. let them get captured) to lure your opponent into a trap (you have to look several moves down the line like chess).  Only played with two people so far.  Upgraded my rating.

RATING: 9
As abstract game that borrows some features of chess and checkers (mainly diagonal movement, characterization of the pieces), Ploy was a pleasant surprise, certainly a viable alternative to offer if your friends consider boring or discounted the above games.

The ability to change the direction of the various pieces is a tactic that can give you some problems in the beginning on how to best manage it, because it is rather difficult to determine when is the right time to shoot his own pawn rather than move: do not forget that with this move, it is as if went over the turn without moving anything, and this can be very risky if the opponent is smarter than you in moving your army, you will spend a lot of games before losing the "queen" of the game against the weaker the "pedestrians" just because you have the wrong move / turn your aforementioned piece.

After you become familiar with this mechanism, however, the fun will not be equal.

RATING: 7
A quality abstract, and I consider it an interesting variant of chess, as the pieces have varied movement and capturing the opponent's "king" (commander) is the object.  Underrated, in my opinion, although worth acquiring only if you really enjoy abstracts or you manage to find an average-priced copy (since they are rare).

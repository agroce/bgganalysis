Very similar to original Carcassonne with only minor alterations. As a result, quite hard to pick up the rules since your instinct is to play the original tactics. Frustrating as a result. I can't see that this is better or worse than Carcassonne - just an alternative version for those who want something a bit different.

It's better than [thing=822][/thing], but then again, so is my toe jam.
The scoring system is a lot better: you can place a meeple or remove one and score it.  That works a lot better and makes the game a lot more interesting.  But a more interesting Carcassonne game...you know what they say about polishing turds and putting lipstick on pigs.

более лайтовый, менее конфликтный "Каркассон". автоматического завершения объектов больше нет, миплов нужно снимать в свой ход, начисляя очки. т.о. очки начисляются всем владельцам готового объекта. в то же время миплов меньше, чем в базовой игре, приходится планировать. начисление очков более стабильно и равномерно, меньше подвержено удаче при вытягивании тайлов. 
пишут, что играется совершенно по-другому.

What a disappointment! There are some good ideas in here, like "place OR score meeple" and the removal of farms, but this game plays like Carc on prozac, with little to no tension. And for some reason, the tiles don't offer a lot of choices, so you often feel forced to play them in certain spots. The scoring, while interesting, is actually too complicated and sometimes feels arbitrary (why are mountains so dull?). The art is absolutely DREADFUL, and not even consistent from tile to tile (some cities have shading, others don't). All this made for a very underwhelming Carc experience, and my girlfriend (who loves Carc) has made it clear that she doesn't want to play this game again. Can't say I blame her...

{1 play • 3 players} I really like the idea of this one, especially the score-when-you-want aspect... but the tiles seemed extra restrictive with a LOT of them cutting things off, rather than giving them a chance to expand.  This meant that you couldn't really grow the place where your meeple was, which was too bad both game-wise (8 points was a really good score) and thematically, as well.  I'll admit, it was the first play for all of us, but more experience isn't gonna change what the tiles look like.

In my opinion the best standalone Carcassonne game. It has it's own rules, not just a new theme glued on to Carcassonne.

RATING: 6
A very different game to regular Carcassonne. 
Does seem far less confrontational than the original and sometimes you can pick a tile that is absolutely useless to you.

I do like it though and it leads to some interesting choices of whether to place or remove a meeple.

Similar to regular Carcassonne, but the rules on removing followers give it a completely different feel.  Might be a little easier for younger players to pick up.

The tiles are kind of ugly compared to Carcassonne.

Colovini's take on Carcassonne.  Despite liking Colovini designs, this variant does not match the original in play.  The scoring is clean and affords new strategies.  The graphics are less appealing.  Overall the game feels more abstract and slightly more strategic than base Carcassonne (as one might expect of Colovini.)  [GTI Code: APSL]

OK, I admit I don't like standard Carcassonne, so I'm biased. This is very different from the original! Graphics are muted, but I quite like them. Scoring opportunities are limited (I only scored 3 times before the final turn.) Lots of tile choices, so getting the one you want is perhaps even harder than usual.  Genuine alternative to Carc, but not sure I like it any better!

RATING: 4
Interesting ideas, but the game lacks the cut-throatiness of original Carcassone (or in my case... Ark of the Covenant) to make it interesting. Maybe if I played it with more than 2 people... but if I was going to do that I'd just play Ark. The map also looks nowhere near as pretty as some of the other versions. All in all a bland feeling permeates this game.

It's Carcassone...  but different.  

This one seems a bit more methodical and thinkier than the other versions I've tried, and was therefore slower.

Wasn't terribly impressed, and some of the way that things scored didn't make much sense to me: specifically why certain houses scored for mountains, but others didn't not.

Once again, if I'm going to play Carc, I'd rather just do up the original with expansions.

After reading review on BGG, I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did.  Nice stand alone game.  Take a few plays to really figure out how to maximize your plays.  Odd to switch your brain from playing regular Carcassonne, which I love.  I like the balance of figuring out when to pull your pieces to score and when to hope to draw new tiles and tack on more points.  Definitely would play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's too bad this one isn't talked about as much as the other Carcassonne's. I think it's great. We play with the variant where you always have a hand of 2 tiles.

One thing that you have to keep in mind in this game (mainly in the 2 player version, less with more players) is making sure that you have a meeple in reserve. If you get rid of your meeples, your opponent may be able cash in on one of his unfinished areas. Then you take your turn, and, suddenly, he puts a meeple back on. You've just given him some free points! I really like this part of the game.

There is a tendency to think of Discovery as "Carcassone Lite."  But, I am not sure that this is necessarily accurate.  While the mechanics of the game are similar (tile-placing), it is different because players have the option to remove their meeples and acquire points immediately.  Admittedly, this strategy will not generate as many points as finishing an area, but it does free up labor for other uses.  This introduces a different kind of thinking process than classic Carcassonne.

RATING: 7.5
I think this is an improvement over the base Carcassonne game.  Scoring meeples as an action adds an extra layer of strategy.  Still has some of the lightness of Carcassonne, but overall a more strategic game.  It's not quite as non-gamer-friendly because of this, though.

It took me a while to get my head around the scoring in this version, which is pretty much backwards from the original.  Still, the changes are nice, and it's great to have a version that doesn't have 8 billion expansion tiles mixed in.  I'm not a big fan of the meeples in this one though.  I know they're supposed to be wearing some kind of hat, but it looks like they're each missing half a head.

RATING: 6.75
I like it. I don't know if I like it more or less than the standard Carc, but I like it. I played it on a bad night, when my brain was having some problems. I couldn't wrap my head around the mountain scoring for some reason, and I wasn't seeing obvious places to put tiles. However, I like the added depth of being able to score meeples whenever you want. With the water, it reminded me a lot of El Caballero.

I like the score vs. place aspect, but the game just seems a bit boring based on the tiles. Not exactly sure why. Just seems, I don't know, ultra-vanilla or abstract.

RATING: 10
I like Carcassonne and I'm liking the different variations.  I like the Discovery more than The Castle and The City because it keeps the puzzle aspect of matching-edge-to-edge that some other games in the series have dropped.  The Discovery is easier and less cutthroat so it's better for friendly family play.  (My wife really liked Carcassonne but sometimes found it frustrating with the stealing of features.  The multiplayer scoring of features is better here.)

It needs a little something else... some spice.  Colovini's games seem to be very polished and in my opinion could use a rough edge or two to make them a bit more dramatic.

This game is marketed strangely.  It's a great "first" Carcassonne, but to have the Carcassonne name is to attract people who love Carcassonne and want to buy more -- and these people might be disappointed, since there isn't really anything "new" and the game is simpler than what they already have.  But for me, someone who never had a desire to add complexity to Carcassonne, this is exactly what I'm looking for.

* IF YOU LOVE CARCASSONNE JUST THE WAY IT IS, you don't need this.  You should look at expansions or new games that offer complexity over the base game.

* IF YOU LIKE CARCASSONNE BUT THINK IT HAS PROBLEMS, this might be a good choice depending on the problem.  If you don't like huge-scoring farms, the equivalent in this game (mountains) have scores in-line with other features.  It's also good if you don't like people stealing your points.

* IF YOU LIKE CARCASSONNE BUT THINK IT'S TOO SIMPLE, stay away.

* IF YOU DON'T LIKE CARCASSONNE, stay away.

* IF YOU WANT TO BUY CARCASSONNE BUT DON'T WANT TO BUY EXPANSIONS, this is a fine choice.  If you like it, you'll like other games in the series, and can look at other titles like The Castle or Hunters and Gatherers.  Whether you like it or not, you won't be tempted to buy expansions. :)

EZ a játékverzió szerintem nagyszerű. Carcassonne és mégis új. A lapkalehelyezés szabályain kívül sok minden más. Először is nem akkor értékelünk ki, amikor bezáródik egy részlet, hanem amikor mi akarjuk, hogy visszajöjjön az ember. Ezáltal generálva a kiértékelési pontokat, aszerint, hogy be van-e fejezve, vagy nem. Így mindig tudunk emberre szert tenni. Viszont csak négy emberrel dolgozunk. A kiértékelés is teljesen más mint az alap carcassonne játékban. Szerintem stratégiailag mint alapjáték, jobb ez a verzió.

A minor disappointment.  Not terrible but doesn't deliver the level of play in expanded basic Carcassone or Hunters and Gatherers.  The scoring methods just don't leave you feeling there's much fun decision-making in the game.  Would have expected better from Colovini.

Having played the game several more times since my first impressions, I still stick with them.  There seem to be more "stuck" positions waiting to draw the perfect tile in this game compared to the other Carcassonne variants.

RATING: N/A
The ablility to remove a meeple to score an incomplete feature on your turn makes the game much friendlier: you can't trap meeples, and you can't invade features to steal the points, and you can always get a meeple back if an investment turns bad.

Colovini shakes up Carcassonne.  Place a meeple OR remove a meeple and score it, not both.  Scoring for complete and incomplete features adds to strategy and allows you to get pieces back if needed.  Not a bad game, but I'd rather play Hunters & Gatherers or New World.

Probably my favorite of the 3-4 Carcassonne flavors I've tried. I find being forced to [i]choose[/i] between placing-to-claim and pulling-to-score adds interesting depth to the game. It also makes those 'wasted turns' where someone draws a mostly-useless tile sting a little less (you can always score something, in addition to trying to place in an inconvenient spot for others), which is a fairly minor thing, but seems to increase overall enjoyment.

RATING: 3
Components: Nice artwork; tiles and meeples of good quality; handy scoring player aids.

Experience: Despite the simplicity of the scoring, it is difficult to wrap my brain around, perhaps because cities are counted for two terrain types, and tiles are sometimes counted for two terrain types. I find that I do not like having the choice of playing or scoring a meeple, even though it adds flexibility, because I'm prone to leave it for too long, hoping it will be worth more later, when I should just score what I can and move on. There are some opportunities for clever re-scoring of the same area.

My least favorite of the Carcassonne variants and expansions I've tried. (I like the original and Hunters & Gatherers about equally.)

Also my least favorite Leo Colovini design. (Favorite is Carolus Magnus.)

My primary complaint in this game is that interaction is even more indirect than regular Carcassonne.

Beyond that, it just doesn't seem like you're building or exploring much of anything--but instead just abstractly trying to get an extra point here or there and hoping for the perfect tile to let you put together something of at least a modest size. (A feature spanning 10 tiles is large in this game.)

This is all disappointing, since I really like tile-laying/modular board games. (I even designed one which, at first glance, looks similar to this one.)

I played this for the third time a couple nights ago.  I was teaching two people new to the whole Carcassone play mechanic.  They were totally confused by the scoring and kept asking me how to score things.  I myself had to keep looking at my score sheet before deciding on a move to make sure I knew how it was going to work out.

Because of this, I found it very complicated, as I did the first time I played.  I would take regular Carcassone with a ton of expansions first.  I'm looking forward to play The City soon.

Another in the endless stream of Carcassonne variants. The main difference is that players are allowed to score incomplete regions at any time (which I don't necessary think is better). A player cannot "hop on, hop off" for quick points either, because she has to either place a meeple or score a meeple, not both. End-game scoring is simpler than the original, which is a plus.

Nice variant of Carcassonne.  Place a tile...then place a meeple *or* retract a meeple (and score).  It adds oceans and some funky/powerful scoring for mountain regions.  On the downside, it is still Carcassonne which means there aren't many decisions to be made.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another Carcassonne game ... players place tiles and wooden pawns to try and maximize the scoring potential.  More of the same, terrain restrictions still exist, but the scoring has been tweaked and slightly simplified - it's now triggered when you withdraw a pawn (an alternate option to placing).  It works quite well, and if you'd never played a Carcassonne game before, this would be a good start.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Yet another clever variation on the basic Carcassonne system that I love.  The artwork could have been a bit clearer-- sometimes it's easy to mistake a mountain range for being bigger than it is-- but otherwise I have nothing to complain about.  Especially now that it's finally available in stores!

Not much to this game at first glance, but after playing it a few times, wow!  This is probably my favourite Carcassonne after the original.  Every tile has different art!  That alone was pretty impressive.  The scoring is very different and fun featuring fewer meeples that you can pull off the board at any time (of course you get more points if you finish features).  Highly recommend.

same old carcassone, with a small new spin. 
A player scores by removing meeples.

I did not like the tile designs (small diagonal territory strips that run to the tile corners) and the graphics where hard to see. made point calculation much harder then it should. 

Game play was good, if you like Carc, but due to the difficult tiles design/graphic combo this may be my least favorite Carc.

The rating will be higher for Carcassonne completists, but as it is this is a slightly dry variant that keeps to the basics.

Played 1 time with 2 players. Yes, this is by far the most original Carcassonne. The scoring is different enough that old ways of thinking about tactics don't really work. That's the good news. The bad news? It's still just another Carcassonne, and if you already have one (or more) Carcassonne(s), you don't need this. But if you don't have Carcassonne, I will say that this, while being the simplest, might also be the best STANDALONE Carcassonne out there. So if you are not into buying expansions, and just want the base game, this is a very good one. Tension is high. That's more good news. More bad news? It's also the simplest and most vanilla of the Carcassonnes. (Of course, if you know anything about Leo Colovini, you'd expect that.) But, it also the most tense Carcassonne. (And if you know Mr. Colovini, you also knew THAT! =) Rate it a 7 if you already own a Carc, 8 if you don't. I'll give it an 8 while pretending no other Carcs exist.

AUG/13 - Hasn't aged well for me, especially as I'm enjoying base _ Traders & Builders the most.

RATING: 6
The Discovery is clearly placed in the Carcassonne universe. While the tile-laying and meeple placement are still pretty much the same, there are only three different landscape types with pretty much equivalent valuation, and scoring is completely different. To start with, you only have four meeples which makes careful meeple management much more important, and then scoring is a player action and no longer happens automatically when a feature is complete. You can score incomplete features, too, albeit for a lower score, and this way it's even possible to score the same feature multiple times.

These changes make the game feel more streamlined and quite a bit more balanced than its ancestor. It rarely happens that one player can score a huge feature that allows him to run off with the victory. The Discovery is more about taking small but consistent steps. Sometimes it is necessary to take risks ("Do I score this incomplete feature now to get my meeple back? It's unlikely it will still be completed, but if it is it will score hugely for whoever managed to draw the right tile...") simply because going without any meeples for too long severely hurts your opportunities on the board, and scoring low is still better than not scoring at all.

If this accommodated more than 5 players, I'd universally recommend it as the better Carcassonne.

I think I get more involved in this than in the original Carcassonne - it's just that bit more abstract and so I trust that thought will be rewarded better.

[Original comment] I have played this game only three times. I like it as an alternative to regular Carcassonne, because of the different scoring method. It is a little difficult to switch between the games, because of that difference, though. 

May 2009 -- We haven't played this game in quite a while. It just never caught on too well with the family, although we have enjoyed it from time to time.

I love Carcassonne and tried to love "Carcassonne - The Discovery" as well. But although after a few plays I liked "Carcassonne - The Castle" I can't convince myself to play Discovery again.

Not sure why this is viewed as a Carc for beginners.  Yes, the scoring appears simple, but in reality you have some tough choices, especially with less meeples to play with.

The completely different scoring system makes it a worthwhile addition to the series, better than "The Ark of the Covenant", but not nearly as good as "Hunters & Gatherers".

For a simplification of the game I wasn't really satisfied with the scoring of mountains or sea tiles.

Having the ability to reclaim a meeple from a poor scoring feature is great.  That said, the scoring is really finicky feeling....

* Fields are scored simply on their size. (It is hard to ignore the towns on the fields, but they have no affect on field scoring)
* Mountains are scored on the number of cities on the mountain or adjacent fields.  (This feels really strange, how is this thematically making sense?  a man on the mountain gets points for really far away towns just because they are on an adjacent field.)
* Water is scored for a combination of size and towns.  (This is very different from anything in classic Carcassonne, but I actually like it.)

This variant of Carcassonne brings an intersting other dimension with more painful strategic choice between opening a feature and counting it. Yes you have less meeples and you can only add OR remove one at a time. Remove to count your points.

Off course at the end the closed feature don't count as much as if you had removed the meeple before.

Discovery is, without a doubt, the ugliest of the Carcassonnes, but it makes up for it with some interesting twists on the design.  First off it's a leaner, meaner version with far fewer meeples to place and a mechanic that lets you decide when to score them.  This is probably the only good Colvini game I've played so far, but it still has its problems.  It feels a little counter-intuitive in comparison to the other Carcs, scores just as random, and removes a little bit of the interaction.  I also hate that it was a Funagain exclusive.  Exclusives must die!

I like the map better than Carcassonne and I like the ability to redeploy followers but the fewer choices for what to do with followers do make the game a bit more constrained.

******* on the 2nd play the scoring system was a lot easier.

RATING: 8
It's Carc but it's not! The "actively remove a meeple to score" adds in something extra to think about. An expansion or two might make this even more interesting, bringing it closer to the appeal that normal Carcassonne has for me.
The downside is that, for some reason, in every game so far when there are about 10-12 tiles remaining, I feel like the game should end right there and then. It's bizarre, but I have had that feeling each time I've played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1 play - Better in theory than in practice.  I really like the idea that you need to pull meeples off prematurely, balancing timing against resource management.  OTOH, the tile mix was such that way too often there seemed to be no productive move.  Too many turns were frustrating "wait until next time" moves, and sometimes a lot of work (esp. in mountains) yielded little payoff.  I'll be interested to see how it plays next time.

I thought this was a neat variation on the Carc theme, especially the aspect of not picking up meeples right away.  As with most Carc games, the random nature of the tiles ensures a lot of replayability.

RATING: 5
This was my first experience into "Euro gaming".  I liked the tile laying mechanic, but there was not enough meat here for me.  I have enjoyed the times I have played it so far, but I foresee it becoming one that I want to hold onto, but probably will not bring to the table that often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Got this because I find regular Carcassonne with all the expansions too much, and liked the idea of being able to score meeples at any time. Need to play a couple more times to judge it properly, but it seemed a little slower than regular Carc because features aren't automatically scored when they're completed.

A very different take on the typical Carc fare. This game is more abstract and requires a proper gamer to grasp the rules (i.e. definitely NOT a family game)

Personally I enjoyed this one, but my friends did not. I really liked the fact that you choose when to score a region, and that you can remove the Meeple whenever you want.

Ebben a Felfedezők változatban vannak nagyon jó ötletek. Kevesebb munkásunk van, de őket könnyebben mozgósíthatjuk, hiszen nem kell megvárni, hogy lezáruljon egy-egy tájtípus. Nagyon tetszik, hogy minden játékos számára van pontozási segédlet, ez az első 1-2 játékot megkönnyítheti, még ha a későbbiekben nincs is szükség a használatukra, mert azért gyorsan meg lehet szokni, hogy melyik akció mennyit ér. Egy biztos, teljesen más taktika kell ehhez a játékhoz. Mi ráadásul úgy játszottuk, hogy mindig két lapka volt előttünk képpel felfelé, és a körünkben választhattunk, hogy melyiket rakjuk le. Ez egy kicsit javít a tervezhetőségen is. Ami viszont számomra óriási negatívum, az a grafika. Anett szerint nem rossz, de szerintem szó szerint gagyi. Lehet, hogy ez erős megfogalmazás, de akkor is így érzek. Ráadásul az eredetinek olyan szép rajzai vannak, hogy annál nehéz hangulatosabbat készíteni. Mondjuk én el tudok vonatkoztatni a megjelenéstől, és így is élvezetes volt vele a játék, de inkább számolgattam, és taktikáztam, mint hogy gyönyörködtem volna a kialakuló térképben.
Szóval a szabályok jók, tetszenek a variációk, de az a helyzet, hogy ezeket a módosításokat át lehet menteni az eredeti játékba is, így ha az megvan, ez teljesen felesleges. Ettől függetlenül persze megtartjuk.

Initial impression.  I dunno - its a decent game - but it offers so little that is new.  The artwork is a couple grades below the parent game.  Not as charming as the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best of the Carcassonne follow-ups.  This one distinguishes itself through its clever twist on the traditional Carcassonne scoring mechanic--there is no automatic scoring in the game at all.  Instead, you must remove a pawn to score it or leave it there and score the area as incomplete at the end of the game.

I do not remember much how the game was going on. I remember that I liked the dynamic of the tiles a bit less. 

But the good idea in this game is that you can take back your meeple anytime you want. So you must decide if it worth it to keep it there and score more points or score now, get less points but place the meeple else where.

A pretty good Carcassonne.  Not as good as the original or H and G, but good.  Different, more like a puzzle.  Totally different scoring.  No farmers.  Good for a change.  No instant scoring is different, you take a turn to score anything.  

The biggest negative:  It's the ugliest Carcassone I've seen...  At least it's an okay game.  A retheme would be nice!

Sokkal békésebb bármelyik másik Carcassonne-nál. Ebben egyszerűen nem éri meg mások fejlesztéseibe beszállni, mert elvenni tőle nem lehet, csak a pontszámokat szintén megkapni. Persze, ha már sok pontja lenne valamiből egy játékosnak, akkor érdemes oda nekünk is betelepülnünk, hogy ne húzzon el tőlünk nagyon senki.
Nem vagyok oda ezért a játékért, nem is valami szép, a pontozást sem sikerült megjegyezni rendesen, mindig nézegettük a segédletet hozzá.

RATING: 6.5
I give this game the same rating as the base Carcassonne game because I enjoy the additional tension of having to choose to remove meeples to score as your one action (after placing a tile) per turn and having to allocate fewer meeples but I miss the ability to outnumber an opponent in a region and steal control from him/her.

Carcassone with plains, mountains and water. A player only has 4 followers, and a decision must be made whether to place a follower  or remove a follower (to score partial points). Mountain spaces only score points for adjacent towns, not the size of the mountain, which is a bit confusing. Rivers are similar but do score for number of water hexes, plus adjacent towns.  Because it is so time consuimg to figure out the new scoring system, I think it is the weakest of the Carcassone series. But there is a neat wrinkle in one has to decide whether to keep their follower on the map, giving up potential points if they pull it off. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Makes you think about Carcassonne in a different way that really appeals to me. I love the mechanic where you need to use an action to score a region by removing a meeple. If you played this and didn't like it, I urge you to give it a second try. I really disliked my first game as I was expecting a standard Carcassonne variant, and was a bit confused by the switch in thinking. After I thought about the game for a bit, I wanted to give it another shot and I'm so glad I did.

A really fun and unique Carcassonne. You are able to remove your meeple at any time from the board and take the points currently available, or leave your meeple until the feature is complete and try for more points. The water ways are also fun to try to collect points from neighboring villages.

Carc simple. I think the meadows are too powerful and therefore luck of the draw is magnified. However the version has steadily grown on me, and has the advantage of possibly being the easiest to explain to newbies. There's some interesting timing decisions to be made throughout as well. The non-return of meeples until you actively decide to score them, thereby not allowing you to place a meeple that turn, provides a more engaging decision point than the base game.

This game has some great new ideas. The scoring is altered a lot from basic Carcassonne - and luckily the game includes help sheets to that. Imho the only thing that needs some time to understand is the point system.
It's also a magnificent thing to be able to score and take back those little dolls from the board even though their area isn't completed.

Another great thing is that there are no more majorities. Now everybody could score the same amount of points from an area despite the number of guys there.

As in every Carcassonne, quite a lot of luck is involved. At least now you can control that luck a bit more easily!

I enjoy this game as much as the original, but do wish that you were able to add expansions to it. With that being said, it's nice to have a 'limited' version of the game where it doesn't go on forever and is quite straightforward. Same concept as the original, but with different terrain and scoring; somewhat easier than the original once you understand the rules.

I'm not a fan of the system, but gave this standalone a go, mainly to get some insight as to the appeal of Carcassonne. This one I like because scoring is in 3 areas, though the mountain scoring has that same spatial problem as with farms in the original. Otherwise, the same issues exist as to what turns me off: your scoring meeple is generally a potential, which will either increase (or be limited) with value, and your scoring status is fractured by the # of meeples:in a nutshell, this is an experience which doesn't excite me. Neither does the labourious end game scoring, when I consider how elegantly it's resolved in the other tile placement game O Zoo Le Mio.

A nice Carcassonne variant, which feels different enough to warrant a new game I suppose. I feel that is plays quicker and is also more luck-based (or push your luck) than the original and less complicated (no farmers etc.). The artwork is nice as well and I actually prefer it over the original. Good if you want to play something like Carcassonne but burner out on the original. On the other hand, if you are looking for the superior experience, there is no reason not to choose the original, so this is more or less a novelty alternative.

Alright, so I played this game a few more times, and I must say, it is quite different than the ordinary Carcassonne version. I am not sure if I fully understand the scoring in this game or not, but it is more fun than I had previously thought. I still need to play the original game in order to make a fair comparison. I actually quite enjoy tile laying games. So, I will continue to play this game ocassionally.

Arguably the weakest link the Carcassonne stable. Couldn't quite put my finger on it as the rule for scoring ONLY when removing a meeple is quite good. Then realised it's the tiles - endless tiles of sea and mountains with only the odd port to break the monotony. It's really dull. Half the fun of Carcassonne is seeing the build up of castles and monasteries, not an endless plateau of mountains and a sea of green.

While getting your head around the scoring takes a half game or so, there are some interesting things going on in this game.  Perhaps the most interesting idea is the ability to remove a meeple before its element has completed, but for a reduced score.  That allows for some interesting decisions on when to give up on a region and when to hand in there.

I need to say that, for starters, I am not the biggest Carcassonne fan. I like some of it, but I grow tired of it quite rapidly. In any case, my experience has been colored by the fact that the games I have played have mostly been quite long due to the fact that all the expansions had been included.
In relation to this particular version, I thought it was more of the same and that the theme did not get me particularly.

Jogo bem mais simples que o Carcassonne base, não só na jogabilidade mas também na arte, que não é assim muito apelativa. Parece um Carcassonne produzido nos anos 80, até player aid tem... Quase não se sente o cheiro aos descobrimentos e fica um pouco a desilusão face ao que a capa da caixa sugere, dando uma ideia de caravelas e mercadorias, que não se concretiza. Esperava muito mais, especialmente sendo uma parceria do Leo Colovini, um dos autores favoritos da família.

A very nice Carcassonne variant.  Being able to place a meeple or pull a meeple to score it, but not both, leads to some interesting tough choices.  The game is more forgiving and arguably less luck-based than the other Carcassonnes because of this: there's no "majority takes all" in the scoring, and there's no "my meeple is trapped the whole game in a worthless unfinishable city".  The new scoring systems for seas and mountains are interesting.

Carcassonne - The Discovery -- Played once; four-player.  There's a lot to like.  Particulary the lack of conflict and the choice between scoring or placing a meeple.  But I found the differences between how each terrain scores not only counterintuitive, but downright annoying.  The different scoring by terrain had no thematic tie-in, and it just seemed arbitrary to me.  I realize that the scoring method in the original game is no less arbitrary, yet I find it intuitive and appropriate.  It's clearly worth another try, but I found my first play disappointing.

Yes, we all need ANOTHER carcassonne game.

And this is a Funagain Exclusive. What gives? I have no idea why Rio Grande gave monopoly of a popular game to ONE single retailer. Do they expect Funagain to sell out the print run?

Sounds like bad business sense on RGGs part. Funagain is also risking the ire of numerous consumers. I'm not a huge Carc fan by any means but this just really irks me (and I'm putting it mildly).

Update: The game is a nice twist on traditional Carc with the main change being that meeples are either placed or removed for scoring after tile placement each turn. Also, all players score if they end up sharing the same sea/field/mountains. Not bad at all.

A good implementation of Carcassonne.  The only thing is, it's VERY thinky.  If you like thinky and you want a beefed-up Carc, I think this would be a winner for you.  For those of us that are used to the play-and-go Carcassonne style, it's a bit of a toss-up.  A 6.

RATING: 7.5
A nice, slightly simpler variant of Carcassonne, with Seas and Mountains and Plains, instead of Cities and Roads and Cloisters etc.  Less competitive than original Carc, as you can't 'steal' areas - rather you both get the points for shared areas.  But there are less Meeples too (only 4 to be playing with!), and so it's often a difficult decision where to place them and (particularly) when to take them off and claim your points!  Like Carc but different enough, and recommended.  But what's with the Meeples having pointy hats (or heads) ...?!

RATING: 6
This version is a bit different than almost every other Carc:
- only 4 meeples
- after playing a tile, may EITHER place a meeple OR score a meeple
- score in one of 3 ways (mountains: 2 per city in mountain range or in touching grasslands; grasslands: 2 per tile; water: 1 per tile and 1 per touching city; all score 1 per ___ if incomplete or at game end scoring; the 2-tile mountains only score max 1), all of which seem to be better balanced than in other Carc games.

OK, I guess. Tough to wrap your head around the new rules -- significantly different than what you're used to playing. I do like the tension of working with fewer meeples and having to decide when to place/score. But the game just didn't do a lot for me. I also think the artwork is really bland!

I like this new version of Carcassonne for its little changes from the original.  The ability to score your explorer (farmer) during the game gives a nice twist, much like the Abbey & Mayor expansion will give to the original Carcassonne.  It is a nice alternative to a great game structure.

This is my favorite Carcassone to date. The decision to place or remove a playing peice adds a lot to the strategy. Top of the Carcassone heap for me.

RATING: 6
A bit more "thinky" than other Carc variants because each tile and meeple placement has more ramifications for scoring of opponents' features.  As a result, the game tends to slog along at a slower pace than other Carc variants and lose some of the fun factor.  An interesting alternative in this series, but won't replace Hunters & Gatherers as our preferred Carc.  A true Carc junkie will like this, but I'd recommend going elsewhere (H&G, original, or Castle) if you're only looking to get one Carc version.

Update -- tried it with three players for the first time, and liked it better than with two.  Seemed to have less of a "he who draws more cities wins" issue, although it may have been more balaced luck in drawing cities.

RATING: 7
Interesting game play. If you;ve played any of the other Carc's, you have to totally change your mechanics. Completing a feature doesn't = immediate scoring is one big change. Sprawling mountians with only a few cities being worth only a few points is another. Having only played it once, I can't say it's as good as the original, or any of the previous variants, but it *is* good.

After a long time I finally got this game played. I usually just play Carc but we were looking for better games to play with a 9 year old and this fit the bill whereas our Carc has so much expansion it would be beyond him. It was interesting though. Certainly stripped down but the lack of meeples (you only have 4 to place all game) was neat. Being able to take off uncompleted features was cool too. I liked it.

I prefer this one above regular Carcassonne for a single reason: the possibility to take out a meeple even when the scoring isn't complete. This makes a whole lot of difference in the game for me.

Funny how serious Carcassonne base game players hate Discovey.  To me the two have an identical feel - solitary and slow.  I disliked Discovery almost as much as I did vanilla Carcassonne.  Give me City, Castle or New World any day.  (Haven't tried Hunters and Gatherers yet.)

Definitely my favorite Carc iteration to date! The usual appealing art style is combined with a streamlined scoring system that focuses on sharing points.  
Don't worry though; it still has plenty of evil chuckle moments as you jump aboard your opponent's big scoring payouts. 
A simple yet fantastic rule variant increases strategy by giving each player an open "hand" of 4 tiles. Adding Tom Vassal's suggestion of reducing play time and AP by re-drawing AFTER your turn makes the experience even better. Definitely nicking for the vanilla game!
A wonderful self-contained gateway game that doesn't need any expansions.

This title is my only continued exposure to the series. I bought it on speculation for introducing non-gamers.  I was  only luke-warm mysef, and some of them have had trouble understanding the shape (visually - whether mountains end or continue in the corners).

One opponent asked for it to come out after a long absence.  In repeated plays she learned to beat me, taking special pride in joining her  pawns to an area where  I had already placed a  claim (as she had previously seen me do to steal from her).

We now bring it out at times of subdued energy.  I  compare its role as similar to the way some people will linger over a cup of coffee after a meal rather than begin something more active.

One play.  It worked for me: I liked the streamlined rules, and my initial concern that it would be too solitaire-like was soon dispelled (though maybe we were a group that could find screwage opportunities in Snakes n' Ladders).  Among Carcassonnes, it slots in below H&G and above the unexpanded base and City. *Update* No so fond after a second play.

RATING: 3
First delve in to the Carcassonne standalone games. The scoring system and play style in The Discovery is oversimplified. Useful to test the water with someone new to the series, but rather limiting to players familiar with the traditional play mechanics. I like that I've added it to the collection, but will not likely play it much, as this is my least favorite of the Carcassonne series.

!CC!

Rated after three games. I think the mechanics in this game are better than in the basic Carcassonne, but there's nothing that special. Ok game, but there are better ones, especially if it takes an hour and an half to play. :) But I think with little bit experienced and faster player the game is more enjoyable. Updated the rating from 6 to 7.

Dropped the rating back to 6 after the 4th play. The tiles are not pretty, scoring is not intuitive and it takes too long.

Fifth play with gamers, not that long, but basic Carcassonne is better. This could be a nice change every now and then, but when the basic game is not played much, there is no much need for this.

The worst iteration of Carcassonne I've tried.  The Discovery doesn't add any interesting or meaningful mechanics.  And the tile art is uglier than vanilla Carcassonne.  Even the meeples are ugly.  Got rid of this as soon as I was able to find someone to generously take it off of my hands.

This is standard Carcassonne, with the ability to remove a meeple from an incomplete structure, at half the points.  I like this idea, and the fact that Colovini compensated for this change by only giving you four meeples with which to score.  The way the mountains and seas score take a lot from the Farmers/Hunters scoring, which I think is a good thing.  For now, this gets the same rating as standard Carcassonne.

After playing the original Carcassonne so much, it took me a full game to get used to the scoring in this one. I like it. There's a delicate balance between getting your meeple down and getting him back off the board. This rating may get nudged up to an 8 (where I have Carc and Inns & Cathedrals) after I fully digest the game. For now it's a 7.

The inhabitants of Carcassonne  have discovered a new region far away from their homeland - one that consists of meadows, mountains and seas. The followers, of which each player only has four (with a fifth for the scoring track) get placed as robbers (in the mountains), seafarers (on the seas) or explorers (on the meadows). On a player's turn, he must place a tile and may then place a follower on it.
\13\ \13\
As in the original game, tiles may only be placed so that identical landscape types match up. A follower may only be placed when no other follower has been placed there yet. When the follower is removed, however, then the size of the region in which the follower is located brings points - regardless of whether the region has been closed off or not, although closed off regions score considerably more points. There's also an additional rule that lets mountainous regions increase in value, even if they've already been completed.
\13\ \13\
This is a distinctly simpler version of Carcassonne than the original. This was the goal during the development of the game. It should have simpler rules, but offer greater strategic depth. What is interesting about the game is that regions aren't scored automatically any more (when they are closed off), this is a decision left to the player (the removing of the follower). Since the regions can only get more valuable, this ensures many agonizing decisions.

RATING: 9
Of the 3 versions of Carcassonne I've played (original, H&G and this), this is the best. It's stripped down, probably easier to play (if a little harder to explain), and best of all, it feels much more balanced. There are no monasteries that give you a potential 9-point, one-tile drop. There's no equivalent of field scoring. There's not even any fighting over scoring large structures. Perhaps because of this, it feels much less swingy; we played two 5-player games of this the first time, and we finished in the same order with roughly the same spread, which would never happen with that many players in original Carc.

If there's a downside, it's that you can't play this as aggressively as you can original Carc. The scoring summary cards are also language independent at the expense of clarity - but, on the other hand, at least they have reference cards. These are small points, though. This is good enough that I'm giving up original Carc and its expansions, a game that was previously on my top 10.

Nice stand-alone expansion for Carcassonne. I love the explorer theme and the addition of the sea tiles.  Nothing really stands out about the game compared to the other versions except minor details- there are no meeples that lay down, and you can score incomplete sections at any time. This allows you to have a pretty constant supply of meeples to place at your leisure.

This game seems to have some potential, although I like The Castle and The City better.

Not really sure if I like the gameplay changes in Discovery.  Scoring meeples is now an action in lieu of placing one rather than in addition to, which I do agree makes the game a bit more strategic in that you have to weigh the choice between the two, but not until later on when you probably could not afford to wait until the next turn.  The sharing of points make this version a lot more cooperative than before, which in my opinion is a bad thing, since I believe the competition makes the tile placement in Carcassonne more interesting.  The scoring mechanism isn't very intuitive either, especially for the mountains and seas, between what counts and what doesn't when it's small, complete or incomplete.

Colovini has significantly altered the mentality required for playing this member of [family=2]the Carcassonne family[/family].

Хуже обычного Каркассона, хотя здесь явно видны попытки сбалансировать игру - "горбушки" на две клетки дают меньше очков, видов территории всего 3 и т.п. Но игра пахнет абстрактностью чуть более чем полностью. Райнер Книция в таком случае нервно курит в сторонке.

I got this after being told it was a good introduction to Carcassonne. Although that seems to be very accurate, I think I could have handled jumping straight into normal Carcassonne, as could most people. I think this simplified version is unnecessary and I regret not getting the normal version which isn't much more complicated and has the option for expansions.

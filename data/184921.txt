Interesting drafting game, with strategic elements.  Not the heaviest game, but there's definitely some depth here.  The first play felt a bit luck-of-the-draw dependent, as it was tough to predict how the map would play out.

Would gladly play again, but don't need to own it.  The complexity is a bit beyond what I'd play with family, but not quite up to the level that I'd play with other game groups.

I like card drafting and this game does it very well. It works better with more than 2 players I find. In two player so many cards do not come out so the game loses a lot of its edge. Do not play with spiteful people :)

The game is reasonably enjoyable, but the board feels too small and busy and makes playing it less enjoyable when you have to stand up and get a closer view of the board every few minutes.

RATING: 5
This has to be the most fiddly game with Richard Garfields name on it. The art is great, but the component design is confusing; everything is very small and the board becomes overwhelmed with tiny components. The game plays out with a draft that feels like acquire in some respects, the majority of the draftable cards allow you to claim a grid space, but there are others that allow you to try to formulate a strategy regarding what types of spaces you claim, or even straight VP cards. Everyone finished very close, including one player who eschewed most of the area control for VP scroll cards. Scoring is extremely fiddly as well, you need to count in each of your connected areas all of the small good icons multiplied by your towers in each region. Half of the board is a score track, which just draws even more attention to how incredibly crowded and busy the board becomes. Overall, quite middling.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A perfectly competent design, as you would expect from Richard Garfield.  Bunny Kingdom is called an area control game, but in truth no areas are contested.  I'd call it  an area occupation game.  Occupying areas with resources and developments scores you in-game points.  A whole load more points come at the end from scoring cards players have salted away.  Everything is driven by hands of drafted cards.  

The game gives you a few things to think about, most notably the extent to which you will chase end game scoring at the expense of getting bunnies on the board. Add to that a question of concentration or dispersal of your bunny fiefdoms.  Nothing too mentally taxing, but fairly enjoyable.  

Production quality and artwork are both good.

RATING: 8
Great implementation of area control with a drafting mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game that features a number of typically popular mechanics including: card drafting, with many of the cards selectively allowing you to place your pieces (here bunnies) on a grid, to thereby form contiguous groupings, in order to eventually score your different groupings at the end of each round, while also collecting end game bonus cards that ideally dovetail with the configurations and placements of your bunnies on the board.

Bunny Kingdom plays very nicely, in an almost breezy fashion, and interestingly, the scoring is pleasing in the first few rounds, with the final scoring being a pit, perhaps, too involved.  It is interesting to play a game like this wherein you almost prefer the early round scoring over the final round scoring.  Typically, it is the opposite.  On the other hand, without the complicated final round scoring, there would not be enough of a game here for dedicated euro-gamers.  Bottom line: a breezy, nice game.

Drafting game. First turn game is a bit meh, second turn you are asking is this even a game? Third turn you finally have interesting choices, forth turn is super hard. Finally scoring a bit hard to see probably the only downside to the game. Even so, i quite like it

I really REALLY wanted to like this since it is done by mister Magic the Gathering himself, Richard Garfield.  However, I can not recommend this game to anyone.  i will probably hold onto it because it's simplicity might be a decent way to get my daughter into other games when she gets older but  yeah.  I felt like the rulebook was written worse than a Fantasy Flight rulebook (I absolutely hate Fantasy Flight rulebooks) and it almost felt as though nothing you did in the game truly mattered.  So disappointed with this one.

Excellent drafting game, so many choices as you move through those hands of cards, and I absolutely loved the theme and artwork. The area influence for scoring is also pretty straightforward but gives you a lot to think about as you're trying to line up those resources. Plus the Scroll cards can add a lot of variety to your strategy, and the deck is so big you can play through with different player counts and never have quite the same game. Board is a little on the small side, and some of my miniature cities kept falling apart, but they're easy to put back together. Richard Garfield knocks it out of the park again.

Gameplay:
I've never had so much fun drafting as I do in Bunny Kingdom. The choices are meaningful and difficult. There are many paths to victory and they are all viable! I've won by collecting treasures, playing a very scroll-heavy game, and by focusing on building high-scoring fiefs. The drafting at 2 players is handled wonderfully, too, because the game has a method of introducing more variety to the hand during each turn (you draw one card, draft one card, and discard one card). In addition to adding variety, this helps to obfuscate your overall strategy. There's also something to be said for the sheer quantity of cards you are given, which add quite a bit of variety and replayability to the game.

It's also a very forgiving territory-control game, which I can appreciate; once you secure a location on the board it can't be taken from you. If you're looking to experience territory control without the added stress of direct conflict [and losing everything you've built], this game is definitely worth considering. It's also a delight to look out at a sea of bunnies by the end of the game. 

Art/Components:
The art is adorable, and I haven't had too much trouble with the components. Nothing has broken and the towers don't feel that flimsy to me. My box did come with one pink bunny who was missing an ear, but I'm not too bothered. Adventuring can be a dangerous endeavor for such a small creature. The size of the board doesn't bother me either. In fact, I quite like that I can fit everything comfortably on my coffee table (and still have space for beverages/snacks).


Overall:
Strongly recommend. Has become a favorite in our collection.

Bunny Kingdom is pitched at just the right level in that it is very easy for anyone to pick up but still offers interesting choices and decisions.  It does not overstay its welcome and the board and pieces are quite appealing.  I would prefer it if graphically they had gone more for scanability than prettiness but it is easy enough to see what is going on as much as you need to.  All the end bonuses are pretty hard to keep track of (you could have 8 hidden from everyone) but overall thats not too much of a problem.  Prefer 7 wonders but would teach new people this first and like the different experience it offers.

RATING: 7
Pretty random and slightly chaotic for an area control, Bunny Kingdom is an unexpectedly good game: everything boils down to a drafting, where players have the choice to nab a few easy points at once (that might also increase over the few next turns) or gamble for more in the end scoring, and with a little luck such bets might also have some kind of synergy with each other that more than rewards the risk taken.

But the deck is huge and you never get to see all the cards in a game, which is enough to screw up any long-term strategy.
This is what I like the most in this game: its unpredictability and how it implicitly suggets players to dare and take some well-rewarded risks.

The flip side is that interaction here is pretty low and comes in the eurogames’ favorite flavor of «obstruct your opponent indirectly just by taking something he would probably need», like the card linked to that square that would connect two smaller fiefs of him into a bigger and more rewarding one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's an enjoyable card drafting/territory game. It can be frustrating when you do not get the territory you're needing to connect your areas, but there are work-arounds to that victory is not hinged on getting 1 card. The biggest flaw is how small the board is; a little bigger board or a separate scoring board would have gone a long way.

Like it - don't love it.  Some parchment cards afford huge rewards while some seem rather miniscule.  Enough chaos and randomness that you have to be able to adjust as you go and not fall in love with any one strategy.  Board gets a bit crowded, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

This is the right length of game for card drafting and area control - what Terraforming Mars should have been. It's pretty quick to explain the rules and start playing but becomes difficult in trying to occupy areas on the board without your plans falling apart. The really difficult part of this game and where it gets a lower rating is the scoring. By the third or fourth round there is so much going on with the board that it's very easy to overlook scoring options or lose track of your count mid scoring. I didn't do great in this game but it was because I switched focus from one area in the beginning to another area of the board. It basically made my first round void and that really set me back. The only thing saving my card was some of the end game scoring scrolls. I would play it again but think it would be hard to get others into the game based on how busy the board becomes.

Very immediate and approachable drafting and area control game.   This has all the signs of a well-polished and highly tuned game.   There is zero downtime.  The choices are plentiful, interesting, and sometimes difficult.   You have to weigh some measure of risk with the location cards that you select and be willing to adjust strategies as you go.   It's very satisfying to play.   There are a TON of bonus cards (end game points) which makes things exciting and tense at the end.   Lots to like here.

The art and presentation are excellent.   I'm not 100% convinced of the bunny colors and the city color.   I had a few broken pieces that needed to be addressed by Customer Service, but nothing major.   There have been many complaints about the scale of the board and pieces.  Yeah, they are small.   They aren't TOO small if everybody sits tight around the board, so play on a small table.  Bigger might be better, but the price would have gone up accordingly and $4o (what I paid) is the right price for this game, I feel.

Well this is unexpected. Mechanically very simple, but the design on offer here is sublime. Card drafting and building placement are central here yet BK offers rewards for clever play AND strategy.  Its wrapper is beatiful and fun, the cards are very well done as the variety and power of cards are staggering. After 4 plays this has sky rocketed into my top 5 of all time.  Yes it needs a bigger board, but please do not let that hinder you from playing this.  Yes there is some math involved but figuring out your score is fun imo.

It wasn't at all what I thought it would be. It is a fun and in-depth strategy game if you have around an hour. My only complaint so far is the mapboard is too small. And, the VP track boxes need to be bigger to accommodate more than one player. Also discovered that playing 3 rounds instead of 4 with 4 players. And, just discarding the last 2 cards in each round makes for a more interesting game and a less cluttered map.

The spiritual successor to Kingdom Builder. Just like KB, it seems like there’s little to no control, but within the card constraints, there is better play. Instead of getting one card a turn, here players draft two from a hand of 10 (in a 4P game) and then pass their deck to the player on the left. 

The board is a grid, and the cards are a mix of position cards where you can place your bunnies (for ex, A3), special cards, and endgame scoring cards. The point is to link your bunnies into groups that will score for X (towers) times Y (different types of goods). 

The special cards allow you to put towers and goods onto the board, and the endgame scoring provide lots of different ways to get bonus points at game end.

The ostensible fun of the game is in the draft. Which cards do you take now vs let ride in hopes of them coming back around? Hate drafting is probably essential to keep opponents from creating large groups. Again just as in KB, luck will play a part here. There are only four scoring rounds, so people who create groups earlier in the game will start scoring sooner and more often.

[b]The theme[/b]: The theme is in line with iello games - rabbits build  a kingdom, trying to get as many points as possible (they gain them for harvesting carrot, fish and wood with their villages or castles). And here is the problem - bunnies and fish? Or bunnies and wood? Isn't it a bit weird? Well, yes, the game could have been about a normal, human, kingdom, but with bunnies, it is deffinitely cuter!

[b]The visuals[/b]: As is usual with iello games, the visuals are amazing. Every little rabbit is well sculpted, with ears and everything. Every castle and village is easily recognizable as well. And every card is so, so beautiful! 

[b]The gameplay[/b]: [thing=184921][/thing] is very interesting - you draft 2 cards, you immediately play them to control areas, build more stuff or access a special scoring at the end of the game. There are many ways to victory (which I love) and the area control is very important (which I also love, as area control is my favourite mechanism). 

[b]The fun[/b]: Thanks to the simultaneous card drafting, the game plays really fast. But the decisions are sometimes very hard as you want 5 cards from the hand, not only 2! There is no direct interaction between players but the indirect one, through area control, is really important.

Who knew Richard Garfield would still be making interesting games in 2017? I liked Bunny Kingdom as it felt kind of like an abstract with a decent (if standard) 7 Wonders drafting mechanic. Decisions were hard to make, but usually because your hand was full of good choices or full of bad choices.  Excellent production from IELLO.  Could have been a higher-rated game from me but when the final scoring round is as long as the game itself it makes you question the design a bit. There were just one too many final scoring cards which required a careful assessment of a very VERY VERY!@# crowded board... and frankly that was such a pain in the ass that it left me with a bit of a mixed feeling.  The final scoring cards are pretty necessary to give the game objectives and tension, but maybe some of the more annoying final scoring cards could have been left out. Or maybe the board could have been made bigger so things were easier to see? Overall, it's about 75% a game I really enjoy and 25% game that I would question playing again because of what it put me through.

Cute, funny area control game. But unfortunately it's too luck based imho. It also has a rich get richer problem. If someone scores 20 points, he also scores that much ore more next round. Almost no way to stop that. And the board itself is too small.

Iello missed a huge opportunity here. The board is simply too small. The minis and castles are cool looking and the card art is great, as is the gameplay. But the look of the game is so underwhelming. However, that doesn't completely overshadow the gameplay, which is really good. The drafting is really fun and the decisions you have to make throughout the game are really compelling. The main issue I have with the game is that it might be too heavy for casual gamers, too light for hard core gamers. This masquarades as a family game, but I can't play this with my seven and five year olds. It's too advanced.

I really enjoy this style of game. It's very comparable to Kingdom Builder in terms of the board and placements. The cards indicating placement locations are actually drafted rather than being simply drawn from a deck. Rather than having a few various scoring methods randomly selected before each game, the special scoring cards are shuffled right in along with the placement cards. Drafting is often an interesting choice between picking a personal scoring card or picking a card that will allow you to make another placement. I also really like the system of drafting two cards at a time rather than the typical single card. The biggest drawback for me is how busy the board gets by the end of the game. It can take a significant amount of time to calculate the final scoring round and the dozens of special scoring cards hidden in front of the players.

Played on the prototype at ParisEstLudique Festival

In this game there are 4 rounds where 10 cards are drafted (like 7 wonders). The board score is counted at the end of each round and at the end of the game objective cards are counted.

The drafting system is very pleasant with quite no downtime and offer some difficult choices.
The objectives cards are not shown to the others players and are very interresting at the begining of the game to make a strategy. 

There is no fight in this game but it is possible to block other players with placement.

On the bad side, i found that the scoring system is a bit hard to calculate at the end of the game. I think it is easy to make some scoring mistakes. Each players has at least 5 objective cards which often mean that you have to recalculate your rabbit placement on the board once again. 

The players' score at the end of the game was between 150-250 (4 players).

Sostanzialmente una meccanica di card drafting simile a quella di 7 Wonders - in cui si scelgono due carte da un set e si passano le restanti al giocatore di fianco - combinata con una di posizionamento di pezzi su una scacchiera comune. Interessante, seppur a bassa interazione.

I love drafting games and this one is no different.
Tough choices, smart ideas.  Fun in bunches.

The reported problems with scorings being fiddly and time-consuming are grossly exaggerated.  Unless you play with patented whiners.
Scorings are perfectly smooth.
The only scoring that takes noticable time (but it's not fiddly either) is the final scoring for scrolls which is enjoyable anyway. 

The only caveat I could agree with is the board being a bit small.  Even now it is perfectly readable, but it could've been a tad larger to improve ergonomy.

RATING: 6
The game is ok. It makes you think you have more agency than you actually do. You're hampered by what cards you have; the cards for bunny placement are so specific, you just play what you have and hope for the best.  The end game scoring is tedious, it's not easy to see and count everything on the board.

2018-01-16 - This is a pretty fun drafting and area control game. I'm not sure why the general reaction has seemed to be that it's meaner than it looks (what, with the bunnies), because it did not strike me as particularly mean. You can hate draft, but that's pretty much it. It's a solid game, though.

RATING: 7
I'm clear on the game's flaws - it lacks originality, the board is not changeable, the game is not expandable (a positive for some), the parchment cards are vastly disproportional in value, and I don't think I'd play it at any count other than 4 players. However, I really like it.

The game takes place over 4 rounds with a scoring at the end of each. Every round players are dealt a hand of 10 cards. Players play two and pass the rest. There are 3 kinds of cards: exploration cards which have coordinates corresponding to every space on the board and allows you to place your bunnies, buildings which enhance spaces with towers or resources where your bunnies are already placed, and parchment cards that give you points at game's end for meeting certain conditions. Orthogonally adjacent bunnies form fiefs and every fief scores each scoring round with a simple towers x different resources calculation. There are three basic resources on the board, so to get big multipliers you need to add unique resource buildings and lots of towers. At the end of the fourth scoring you add points from collected parchment cards and most points wins.

I think I like this game disproportionally to its actual quality. I really enjoy placing pieces with limited options and leveraging placements for points as the game progresses. This is fundamentally how Kingdom Builder works as well. KB is the better game, with a variable set up, more options, and powers to shoot for and employ. Even still I'm keeping Bunny Kingdom because it scratches an itch I like to have scratched.

RATING: 4.5
Game is alright, but the annoying part is reading the board state because it looks like a mess when there are so many bits on the board. Gameplay slows down significantly because you have to constantly check coordinates. I guess only chess players wouldn't have this issue. Because of this, drafting is not a very strongly tied mechanic to the game because it would take way too much time to read the board state properly for each opponent and evaluate hate drafting correctly.

RATING: 6
Bunny Kingdom sounded like a drafting Version of Kingdom Builder. Too high hopes, playing it was not as entertaining as I expected. The light-hearted drafting is overshadowed by the heavy scorings. The decisions are not as interesting as I hoped with cards being differently strong, a few of them so strong making some choices obvious. The boardplay can be relegated to second fiddle by strong scroll cards (victory conditions) and is prone to luck of the draw when decisive spots are hate drafted.

Not a bad game and I would join in again. But I rather play Kingdom Builder or my newly acquired filler of choice, Fantasy Realms, if I'm looking for sophisticated end game scoring.

A very fun drafting game with a fantastic theme with lots of tongue in cheek references to pop culture. Works very well for 2 players as well, where it feels surprisingly more strategic, as I find it easier to focus on anti drafting and upsetting the other player’s board position, since you’ll get to both draft and discard a card each turn. I understand that many people find the score calculation fiddly, but as a math geek, I actually enjoy calculating.

Only one game is so far but this landed really well for us.  The hate drafting is epic.  The end game scoring is really important, obliterating what looked to be run away leaders etc.  Great art/bits/presentation.

After 5 games, I had to raise my rating - this is THAT good. One of the best family games in a long time. Just great!

I enjoyed the gameplay. Card design and artwork is great, and I like the card drafting mechanic over the four rounds. Not sure what they were thinking during play testing though. The actual board is mini size, despite coming in a large box. Tough to see the icons on the board, which is a major hassle considering how important bunny placement is in order to score points. The castles are also a big disappointment. They're made of cheap, thin plastic, and are extremely flimsy, breaking easily during the first gameplay out of the box. This was with adults handling them. They would all be destroyed in a few minutes by kids. In summary, I really enjoyed the gameplay and the quality of the cards. I'd take a pass on purchasing the first edition of this game though. Would consider purchasing it if they fixed these major issue in a reprint.

Ein Mehrheitenspiel mit Draftmechanismus.
Okay, Anfangs dachte ich, das Spiel wird es schwer haben mir zu gefallen, aber man kann tatsächlich mehr steuern als ich gedacht hätte.
Anfang der Runde werden 12 Karten gedraftet, wobei jeder Spieler immer 2 Karten behält und direkt ausspielt. Es gibt für jedes Feld der Landkarte eine Karte, eine solche berechtigt dieses Feld in Besitz zu nehmen und einen Hasen darauf zu stellen. Desweiteren gibt es Städte- und Ressourcenkarten, mit denen man auf bereits besetzte Gebiete Städte bzw. Ressourcenfelder bauen darf.
Sobald alle 12 Karten verteilt sind gibt es eine Zwischenwertung in der man in jedem zusammenhängendem Gebiet alle verschiedenen Ressourcen zahlt und sie mit den Stadttürmen (1-3) multipliziert.
Das Spiel geht über 4 Runden mit 4 Wertungen und einer Endwertung in der noch die Schriftrollenkarten (Sondersiegpunkte) eingerechnet werden.
Das Spiel hat mir tatsächlich sehr gut gefallen, nur die Schlusswertung fand ich etwas fummelig, da für die Sondersiegpunkte nochmals genau geschaut werden muss welche Ressourcen hab ich jetzt wo auf dem Plan etc., aber die Zwischenwertungen gingen erstaunlich flott und auch das Drafting war sehr übersichtlich.
Spiele ich sehr gerne wieder mit.

I can see the comparisons to KB, however they're more loose after having played. There are territory types, and goal cards, however goals are individual, more plentiful, and more varied.

The grid system is interesting. Given that you can claim any empty space with camps, I expected more players to get booted from a space claimed in that manner, but more often than not, the player drew the space specific card.

The game felt less directly competitive than KB, and less tense. It was interesting, and fun, but not great; just good.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play with 2 players, but very excited to try it again.  

You are drafting cards (40 total/player IIRC) that either score you points at the end of the game, secure a specific square on the map, or let you add extra resources to a square.  There are 3 main resources in the game (fish, carrots, & wood) and a handful (~5?) of rare resources (1 of each type in the game).  As the game progresses (4 rounds total), you have more to consider with each card drafted.  Was a little thinker than I expected it was going to be, maybe 2.0 in weight or so.

Looks to have various paths to victory based on the end game scrolls cards.  You will want to build areas with different resources & lots of towers (scoring = # of towers X # of different resources) for general scoring purposes, but the end game cards will also give you other options to shoot for.

Update after 3 plays: Played this once at Gencon and really wanted my own copy.  Finally found a trade and played it again - not as fun as I remembered.  Not really enjoying the decisions I'm making while I'm drafting.  I would happily play someone else's copy, but not one I need on my shelf.

Wonderful, crunchy, drafting goodness. If you love drafting (and some area control), this is a game for you. Otherwise, go elsewhere. It does have a small, somewhat cluttered board, and lengthy endgame scoring, so it's not really for casual gamers despite its relative lightness.

But if you can get past that, you have tons of fantastically agonizing drafting decisions packed into a short time frame, which is as good as it gets for me. Also big pluses: the gorgeous card artwork and the groan inducing bunny puns.

Really enjoying this one. I'm a sucker for card drafting. Drafting pairs makes it easier to form combos, but the size of the hands makes wheeling a real possibility too.

Wasn't completely sold on this game after one play, but additional plays have really solidified it for me. This is basically the love child of 7 Wonders and Kingdom Builder, which works for me since those are two of my favorite gateway games. You draft cards two at a time, which I like, and score points from having bunnies on the map and through scoring cards. I do wish that the map play was a little more interesting, as it's difficult to score big unless you get the right cards to give you a bigger variety of resources. Still, a very fun game, and one of my favorites from 2017.

RATING: 5
Draft cards to place bunnies on a map. The more castles and unique resources you get in the same group, the higher your score. In spite of its random push-your-luck decisions, it's an OK game where you need to position yourself on the map so that your opponents are more likely to give up the cards you need more than they do. However, the overly powerful parchment cards not only add too much randomness but also make the end game scoring way too long.

Bunny Kingdom replaced Treasure Hunter for me as my go to Richard Garfield card drafting game.  Not a big fan of the rabbit theme, but it is different enough that I am alright with it.  The board building is fiddly with the little bunnies, but the game play is interesting and made area control fun with two.

Set over four rounds, this has players drafting cards to claim and enhance board plots to maximize points. In the first round, most choices seem arbitrary, but after the first main placement, things get exponentially more interesting. Suddenly, the game turns into a knife fight and land grab on many fronts. There seem to be strategies that reward not just trying to build one giant kingdom, but I'm not sure how likely they are to prevail over the most obvious one...

This game has more theme and roleplaying immersion than Fog of love, a game that was supposed to be all about roleplaying, but was weak on that aspect as well as failing as a game. Seems like a kids game at first but don't let that fool you. This is the essence of MTG draft at it’s very best, with family friendly rabbits adding to the fun. My wife loves it for bunnies, and I love the absolute joy of hard decisions in what cards to keep, what to discard and what to pass on. The board looks great with all the pieces, and we never had any problem with the size of the board. Never had a problem with final scoring as it was easy to see the kingdoms, at least in a two player game. Only neg is that there are a lot of cards to shuffle. 

Mid to light weight complexity, great art on cards, and most importantly, fun!

Loving this light drafting game. Essentially you do four rounds of drafting 2 cards at a time. The cards either have a location on the grid where you place a rabbit meeple, an endgame scoring criteria, or a building that can be added to where you have a meeple, to increase the scoring for that meeple's grouping. At the end of the round you calculate your score by multiplying the number of castle parapets in your orthogonal chains of meeples times the number of different resources in those spots. 

This game does everything right. The drafting 2 cards at a time means you can hate draft your opponents while still getting something nice for yourself. The iconography is clear. The rules are simple and elegant. The components are fantastic. Because every player has a record of everything they do in their discard piles, scoring the end of game scroll cards isn't a bear. There's luck mitigation in the building cards. I've enjoyed this so much, I don't normally play a game three times in one week, but this I have with three different groups and it's gone over wonderfully each time. If you are looking for a 45-60 min light drafting game, give this some serious thought.

It's wabbit season! This is a quick little drafting game that involve picking cards that correspond to locations on the board where you can place bunnies. You get 10 cards each round, and there are four rounds. The scoring is similar to Kingdomino where is multiplicative based on resources and strength. There's a good amount of luck in the game as sometimes you just get bad initial draws while other players get powerful cards such as sky towers or markets. I also underestimated the amount of points that treasure cards can score.

I had zero interest in this when it was announced. The cutesy bunny theme is a real turn off for me. I kind of accidentally fell into giving it a play.

An interesting mix of card drafting, area control and hidden strategies.  The game play is simple.  Chose two cards from your hand and then all play them.  After the hands run out build and then score.  Do this four times and then reveal and score hidden parchment cards collected.  It's a little abstract and a little random but there are thoughtful decisions when choosing cards that matter.   The theme is not really relivent to game play but the artwork and is beautiful and seems to add enjoyment to the game.  If it were just medieval themed it would have that extra charm that the bunny theme gives.  Overall, a really enjoyable game.

I liked almost everything except how it goes from a super-smooth, quick turns game to a stretching halt for final scoring.

Not great. Players draft cards and then play them, either representing a particular space on tbe board which they occupy or an enhancement to that space or an end of game bonus. Each round the players draft cards two at a time and score at the end of the rounds, based on areas they control (number of city spires * goods). 
Unfortunately like most drafting games it involves a huge amount of luck which because the game constantly, and largely pointlessly, interrupts the drafting seems out of place with the relative length of everything.

:) Beautiful popping game art and cute components.

:) I love the way the gameboard forms a colorful classic map with ABC... and 123...- coordinates which relate to game cards depicting images of those areas on the map (a steep mountain on the playcard relates to a mountain spot on the board, a peaceful farm to a farm area, ...)

:) Some engine building aspects in combining town-towers with different types of resources in one big connected area. This mechanic is pretty satisfying. The card drafting mechanic does a good job of keeping everybody involved and distributing the cards in an interactive manner.

:) The game is easy to understand, easy to teach and quick to play. It keeps everbody involved, there is no downtime.

:) The game plays really quickly. It makes for a perfect filler or a suitable family game.

[u]The Negative:[/u]
:soblue: You need to create a connected area on the map, and depending on the cards you are dealt the game can give you an easy or an impossible job of doing so.

:soblue: There is a run-away-leader effect in this game. Players getting their area together quickly will start generating lots of points and others won't be able to catch up.

:soblue: Near the end of the game, the board can get a little cluttered up by different tokens, pawns, ..., making it harder to make the right choices and making the scoring rounds a bit challenging.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
I prefer heavier games, but I enjoyed playing Bunny Kingdom as a filler or family-oriented game. The art really draws you in. The mechanics are simple but work well: using card drafting you try to play interesting cards. When done right, you will quickly set yourself up a satisfying point scoring area which will reap in a ton of points every scoring round. The game is simple, appealing and it doesn't outstay its welcome. I can see this game working with teenagers or with game groups looking for a short simple yet fun game which combines the satisfaction of elementary engine building with a relaxed atmosphere around the table.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) There are only three different resource types available printed on the board. You will need more different types of resources in order to leverage your point scoring potential. Early on in the game focus on getting a coherent connected area on the map, preferably by area cards with coordinates close to or next to each other. During the game prioritize on (ordered in decreasing priority):
1. luxorious resources to boost your scoring potential 
2. 3-tower cities
3. 2-tower cities
4. interesting area cards in order to form an enclosed area (use camps when necessary, but know that they are less reliable) or skytowers * starting mid game and later
5. bonus point cards *
...

Love the bunnies and the artwork.  I really like the idea of the game, I actually was enjoying it ... until the board started getting crowded.  It is just too busy and hard to see the resources.  On top of that AP sets in.   Had to trade away.  Shame.

Interesting drafting game that certainly feels a bit different from other games.  Place bunnies on a board, or draft "mission" cards to aim for.   Cute plastic bunnies!

Demoed at Gencon 2017.

A note about the demo for the publisher:
My group had a bad experience in the demo with this one. We had a big guy with glasses giving the demo, and he started explaining each card before explaining the basic concept, point scoring, and end conditions, then he abandoned our table. We nearly left but got rescued by someone else who very kindly let us play the whole game to make up for our wasted time. Whoever that first guy was, he should not be allowed to give demos anymore until he has been given proper instruction.

The game:
It's essentially a card drafting worker placement battleship mashup. The ladies appreciated the theme. Putting bunnies in castles and buildings was a nice touch. Without the parchment cards it would quickly become dry. I can see this one becoming fairly popular.

Love the card drafting.  One of my favorite mechanics.  I'm not overly thrilled with playing with bunnies so the theme is indifferent for me, it really could have been anything.  Trying to build your fiefs and gain resources is strategic and fun.  Don't overlook the end game scoring scrolls, which is easy to do in the beginning. They can make up a lot of points at the end of the game and you don't know what your opponents have as they are kept face down.  I thought the components could be a bit better and board game a bit bigger.  Overall I enjoyed playing the game and would play again.

Bunny Kingdom is a fun drafting game about building up fiefdoms. I have a few gripes with the game, but overall I've really enjoyed it. The difference in value between some of the cards can frustrate certain players if they don't get the cards that they want, and the better buildings may be a little too important. The other issue is that the rules for 2 player don't work nearly as well as the multiplayer rules.

I did not like this game as much as I thought I would.  It seems it can be too easy to not run across the right cards or not be able to get the right cards at the right time.  I also did not find the game to be as exciting or as thematic as I was hoping it would be.

A lighter area control game with cute theme. In my first game the game did not become too nasty, but I can see it being fairly competitive depending on how the cards come out. I saw few possible path to victory which is a plus. 

For the box size, the board is way too small making the icons on the board difficult to see once you start placing objects on the space.

This is a light take on Acquire: claim random spots on the board, trying to build large contiguous areas to score VP. With a lot of twists:
- each round (of 4), you draft the cards (2 at a time) so you have a bit more control here than in Acquire
- your areas (fiefs) are worth (different types of goods produced) x (total number of towers in the fief). Some goods are preprinted on the board while others come from the card draft; same for the towers.
- you can draft a bunch of end-game-scoring cards as well, which are either worth intrinsic VP or give you VP based on meeting various board conditions (e.g., 9 cities, 10 fiefs, most fish, ...).

I’m not a fan of Acquire, and similarly not a fan of this. I kind of like this a bit better simply because of the drafting. But all that end-game scoring was such a pain in the ass ... WAY too “fiddly”! Maybe this would be better as an app?

On the fence with this one so far.
2 player is clearly an after thought variant that works but is not quite satisfying as far as drafting go.
3 player game as way too many leftovers cards for my taste.
Waiting to try with 4 players to form a final opinion.

Stupendously (over)produced placement game sort of like Kingdom Builder meeting Acquire. Players draft cards featuring either unique grid references for locations on the board, special end-game scorings (X points if you occupy Y forest spaces, etc.), buildings to place and a few other special powers.

At each scoring, a player's controlled areas score for number of different types of production (fish, carrots, wood...) multiplied by the value of the castles therein.

Like most drafting games, the decisions are primarily around which cards to keep and which might make it back around the table to you. There's certainly more than a dose of luck to this, of course; the board is large enough that producing contiguous regions for scoring is a crapshoot. Other cards vary wildly in value, some conditionally (e.g. carrot scoring for a carrot-heavy player), some just always strong.

It plays smoothly and the artwork -- and general production -- is fabulous. There's much too much luck in it for me, however, partly because the balance is skewed much more towards end game scoring cards than I had expected, probably 50% or more of most player's scores unless they luck into large and profitable fiefs.

Card drafting to place and enhance areas on a 10x10 grid in 4 rounds. In the first round, you have little context for anything, unless you happen to draw adjacent spots. By the fourth round, each location card has to be located and evaluated. In the end, a lot comes down to what variable victory point cards you get, and how many special resource cards you get, since you score domains as number of castle towers x number of unique resources; both can be placed with little restriction, so since few special resources exist, who gets what is a major element in scoring. Lots of castle towers, lots of common resources (3 unique, carrots, fish, and wood), few unique resources.

This is a bit more abstract than I typically like, but I enjoy the card-drafting mechanic a lot. Have enjoyed my first few plays of Bunny Kingdom ... hoping it will stand up to repeated play. The bits are great and the theme at least somewhat amusing. Seems like there are some cards, like the ones that link kingdoms together and the ones that supply special resources, that should never be passed to an opponent in the draft, but I guess time will tell. While I like this, it hasn't gone over swimmingly with my game group, which could mean it gets ejected from the collection at some point.

RATING: 4
The Bunny Kingdom board is much smaller than it appears in photographs, with cities and rabbits crowding each other out over top of the few visable pixels of faded art that convey terrain and resources.  Many of the resource icons are the size of a pinhead.  The board folds into a fraction of the box and feels like a travel version, and the game grid was shrunk to a portion of the board.  This game is very difficult to see and play. Needs chopsticks for the bits.

RATING: 9
First play impression: really liking it. Draft some cards, place buildings and bunnies onto the board, and work toward your end-of-game scoring cards. Really easy to learn and play.

I will say that the small board isn't great, but it's not quite as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be. You can tell where everything is on the board easily enough. The only real issue is the lava sections that block off certain spaces. They are printed as a small border and they can easily be covered by playing pieces or overlooked because they don't stand out very well. Everything else is easy enough to see, but a larger board would be better.

My only possible issue is the end of game scoring. You have to go through lots and lots of cards and compare them to what's on the board. I would say it takes longer than 7 Wonders scoring.

Fun game, can't wait to get more plays.

Wonderful game.  Only played as two player, but I feel like it would play just as well with more.  The card drafting is fabulous with tons of cards and interesting decisions.  Multiple paths to victory and play time around an hour.  Very fun and silly game but with some serious meat to it - awesome game!

Tem jogos que você olha o foto de um tabuleiro depois de um jogo completo e vc já sabe "Esse jogo eu vou gostar". Foi o que aconteceu comigo assim q vi Bunny Kingdom pela primeira vez. Uma excelente mistura de 7 Wonders voltado para controle de área, não se deixe enganar pelo seu visual fofinho, aqui dentro tem muita estratégia. Essa característica lembra até Lords of Xidit, talvez sua temática um tanto infantil tenha atrapalhado um pouco um possível hype, mas não deixa de ser um ótimo jogo, tanto casualmente quanto para quem gosta de jogar com a calculadora do lado.

Drafting game, better than Treasure Hunter in that the drafting choices are harder and the perceived values of cards become very different per player. Very luck-dependent, and I've seen two recent games where the winning player was the one with best first round.  The importance of having an early good fief is not only that it will score four times, but also it allows singularity of focus and informs the card evaluation. Hate drafting is the only interaction, and probably essential.

2p game is ruthless. 3 and 4 are interactive but not to the same extent. The grid management is the most interesting portion, but you're forced to take a significant number of parchments in order to leap up the scoreboard at the end and you may or may not see them early enough to form any kind of long term strategy. That isn't a problem if you like tactical games though, and I do.

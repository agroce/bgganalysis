Hmm...this isn't as good as San Marco.  Not by a long way.  Having said that, it, it works ok and can be fun to play. Artwork is not as good as you'd hope and many of the action cards look similar to each other.

RATING: 3
From the rules it seemed like a brilliant adaption of the board game. My first two plays of the game were a big disappointment. Too much special cards came up, and when a Doge came up the fight was over quickly because of lack of area cards. The first four areas were won without the defender even being able to play a card! I could blame this on the bad luck of the draw, but it seems like the card-distribution is off.

It's not as good as the original San Marco (one of my all time favourites) but it's a very good adaptation for 2 players.

Underrated game here on BGG. I think that if the artwork looked more profesional it would appeal to more players.

When we learned this, we had never played San Marco.  We wish the rules were more clear, but we still enjoy this game.  Watching the dealer agonize over how to divide out the cards is the best part, and the most difficult.  Our games have all been close.  Note: now that we have played San Marco, we prefer that.

Components: Standard cards. Nice art for the district cards, but the art for the other card types is very fuzzy.

Experience: In my few games, the strategy seems to have been to use the Doge to resolve a district we were relatively certain the opponent was void in, thus ensuring a victory with only one card spent. Fairly quickly the deck consisted mostly of special cards, with few district cards remaining, thus we had built up our hands and would then spend several turns resolving Doge cards. A fellow player has pointed out that the traitor cards are essential to prevent a player from hoarding all of one type of card, and I must agree, but I don't find it fun to be stolen from so often.

Why don't I like this one more? "I cut; you choose" ought to work for two people. The competition for districts seems anti-climactic, as one of the players is likely not to have enough district cards to make a battle of it.

A really addicting game !
I don't know exactly why, but it's addictive.
Regardings the artwork, districts are ok but the others are quite awfull (the San Marco's action cards are beautiful).
Regarding mechanisms, you should probably play some sessions before knowing how to divide the cards (in fact a lot of).

A dissapointment. I liked San Marco and was hoping to get something similar but for two. And yes - it is similar in a way. A very distant one.

San Marco is a great and deep tactical game. This one is definitely not. Luck in the draw makes the game too random for the idea that stands behind it. These two just don't fit together.

RATING: 5
Although the theme is the same and there is card-dividing as a mechanic, this game does not play or feel like a two-player version of San Marco.  That doesn't mean this is a bad game in any way, it just may not play as you expect.  There is card dividing involved, but how you play your cards is completely different.  On the whole this is a nice game, with interesting decisions on how to play your hand.  Sadly the production quality in this game is a bit lacking, from both a functioning aspect as well as the overall look and quality.  The district cards are nice since they borrow the artwork from San Marco.  The other cards look too similar to each other, are very drab, and look like bad computer models that have a computer 'stipply' effect on them.  The symbols for the cards are only on one end, so you can't lay them out very easily when you make your offer.

The San Marco "I split, you choose" system seems like a natural choice for two players, but unfortunately the game system is prone to spinning off the tracks.  The most obvious problem is that there are too few cards for each district, perhaps because of the limits of Adlung's production format.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Canal Grande, as San Marco's little sibling for two, is an I-spit-you-choose game which captures a good deal of the drama of its sibling (e.g., fighting for districts with matching cards rather than placing cubes).

As the game progressses however, there are less and less district cards available (as they are before the players to represent districts) which means that there are increasingly more and more special cards: the game gets swingier as it progresses. Which means that games are either tight until the end, or the game breaks wide open in the last third and the winner crushes it. Which is generally fine considering the length of the game.

Just like its big brother San Marco, an ugly cover (who chose that font?) but more attractive inside the box.  The cards are nicely illustrated, with a much less attractive design on the back.  But design issues aside, I was surprised to enjoy this much more than San Marco.  You get the same difficult decision-making process in the "divide and choose" mechanism.  The limit points are still there, the districts are still there, you just lose the little bridges (though the gondolas stand in, I guess), and the objective is slightly different (card majority vs. area majority).  The game plays much more quickly and is very engaging as you try to decipher what cards your opponent has and what his/her movtive is in cutting the cards in such a manner.  I don't regret having traded away San Marco - this fills in the void in a very pleasant way.  I more often have 2 players than 3, so this is great.

I really wanted to like this game, but there are too many problems. The elections seem over very quickly- often, they go uncontested because the opponent doesn't have the right cards. Additionally, the Spy and Doge cards are just ugly- dark and out-of-focus (plus, there are too many of them). This has not diminished my eagerness to try San Marco, but Canal Grande itself has not come off the shelf in a good long while.

I love San Marco, and this game captures a lot of the fun stuff in that game, but, of course omits some too. I like the El Grande like scoring, etc. of San Marco, whereas this card game really emphasizes the choosing and selection phase.

Great game. Played it yesterday with a friend and we realy had a good time. We just had one question left after playing the game.

RATING: 8
Designed as an adaptation for two players of the bigger board game San Marco, Canal Grande is a tightly constructed card game involving building sets (the goal is collecting either four cards of one single colour or one card of each of the six colours), bidding and a very clever mechanic to distribute cards between both players at the beginning of each turn (one player draws the cards and divides them into two lots, the other player chooses first). While the play isn't overtly heavy, both bidding and preparing the lots require a good amount of skill and double-guessing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Excellent little push-and-shove for two which is winnable even from a poor position. Bizarre, fuzzy art isn't to everyone's taste but is actually quite atmospheric. The one gameplay flaw is there are perhaps one or two too many Traitor cards in the deck, particularly in later rounds when the districts are largely out of play, and hence they can make a big difference. An easy fix is simply to remove a Traitor at each round-end stage.

Further Thoughts: Pushing the boundaries of gameplay reveals this might actually be a tad broken. Dropped from 7.5 to 6.5 while we investigate further.

I really liked San Marco, but this one played a little stiff the first time out.  Hopefully it will improve with a few more playings.

The Solomon mechanic isn't my favourite, but it certainly makes for a 2 player game that's different from anything else I have. Lots of hard decisions to make each turn, but a trifle repetitive in that regard. A 6 after 2 games.

Kinda strange game... I don't seem to be able to get the strategy to play this. I always lose, no matter how often I try. the 7 is for the playing mechanics which I find to be very original, but I still need to feel that I know how to play the game... which I don't at the moment... :$

This game really looks ugly! But nethertheless I like to play it very much. The game stands now at 9! It is right now my preferred 2-player game due to the playing time and the fun I had playing it. Second only to Blue Moon.

I like it! Interesting mechanism, breaking a group of cards into two pieces. Your opponent gets to pick one of two piles that you have built. Agonizing choices to make. After that, though, play is fairly straightforward. I like the tension that builds as you get closer to the end: do you go for all of one color, or one of each? Neat. 3/06: Dropped to 6. It will be very difficult to get this to the table, as for a 2-player card game (which I play very rarely) it'd probably be San Juan. I do really like the theme of this game, and have never played my copy of San Marco.

RATING: 6
San marco board game has a cool mechanic where a player has to divide cards into two offerings and then gets to the pile that is left after the other player has made a choice. This card game is practically only this mechanic and some set collection added on top of it (instead of gaining influence in provinces). The artwork quality is horrible - very blurry/grainy.

Definitely fun, the mechanic is great but like others have said...this is game is missing something.

The inevitable analysis paralysis of the pie cutting mechanic from San Marco has become palatable for me in this 2 player version. May feel samey after a few plays, but interested to play more of this bidding game.

RATING: 5
Not a bad adaptation of the board game.  Has much of the feel but cards just can't compete with the richness of the boardgame itself.  It is quicker to play and portable.

A cute and clever little game. While certainly not in the same major leagues as San Marco, the lineage and mechanisms are there. This is one of the stars of the minor leagues

IMO, a board game's mechanics are rarely applicable when redesigning it as a card game, but in this case Canal Grande seems to be a natural progression of San Marco. It uses the same, innovative dealer/drafting mechanic used in San Marco, but it implements them as a 2-player hand management/set collection game, rather than area control.

All in all, I enjoy Canal Grande for what it is. A 2-player card game with an innovative mechanic that develops interesting decision making, but if I had a choice I'd rather play its big brother, San Marco.

Only one play so far, but not as much fun as I thought it might be.  The splitting decision was interesting, but I felt like it was missing something.  I think I overplayed some hands, but I can't imagine getting much more enjoyment out future games.  I'll give it at least one more go before I give it a final rating.  Rating - 6  March 16, 2009.

A mini-San-Marco. A lot of cards shuffling and drawing, but the thrill of dividing cards into two offers as fair as possible remains. Why ask for more?

After one game I'm vastly unimpressed: collecting an entire district seems a pretty unstoppable strategy while the randomness of the traitors can totally destroy strategy. But, I may be wrong particularly on point 1, thus the game deserves more plays.

RATING: 8
I had high expectations for San Marco and it didn&#039;t live up to my own hype.  Consequently, my expectations were lowered for the card game and I was pleasantly surprised!  The card game retains the divide and choose mechanism, which I really like, and the elections are intense.  There are a ton of important decisions in that deck of cards!  A lot of drama throughout the game, especially towards the end.

RATING: 4
Although I like San Marco a lot, this fell completely flat for me. The 'cookie-cutting' mechanism just doesn't cut it with two, because the lack of other interested party is a great miss. You could play this with 4, but why not play San Marco instead?

The San Marco based card game.

Incorporates the uniquely superb mechanic of having to split the 8 cards into 2 hands and offer your opponent the first choice.

You are forced to continually get decks balanced.

Old Alan Moon "you divide the pie, the other player chooses first" game. Some nice decisions to be made here, as you pick up 8 cards and can divide them in any way you wish, even 7 in one pile, 1 in the other. But, since the other player gets to pick first, you have to make sure you'll be happy with either pile. It's fun to bury a card you desperately want in the worst pile, but then find the other player chooses that anyway, just to keep you from getting the card. Similarly, try and put some bad cards in the pile with the card that you know that they want, and watch the expression on their face as they take it.

Traded it away at the Montreal math trade 14.

This game has elegant, stripped-down mechanics, but the game leaves a bit to be desired.  Since the Doge cards have to be played as soon as they're drawn, it leaves the action largely out of your control.

GAME: Prussia's Defiant Stand
RANK: 4678
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A underrated game of an american designer about a uninterested theme to the american wargamers. Probably the best game of the Seven Years War to Two Players (Frederich is the best to four players). Brilliant conception of the tactical battles of XVIII century(leader/artillery, infantry, cavalry). Enough estrategic choices to both sides and a very good operational simulation of the 7YW in central Europe.

A session can get in 3 hours.

RATING: 7
Probably the most unique combat system for a low-complexity block game on the market and that is a very good thing.  This is a really clever design.  The original rulebook gets maligned, but the designer published a very [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/88328/prussia-22-rules]excellent living rulebook[/url] that fixed lingering problems.  The end result is a GREAT looking game with mounted board and higher quality cards than its peers, original game play and an excellent combat system.  HIGHLY recommended.

Horriffic rules.  How can such a graphically marvelous game have such murky rules.  I think there is a good game in there. It's just hidden in the mud that is these rules.  One of the worst rulesets I've seen.

Initial Impression: This is the first Worthington game I've seen where I can honestly say that I'm impressed with the production values. The blocks and stickers look great and the mounted board looks simply stunning. I very much enjoyed my first playthrough of the game and particularly enjoy the tactical battleboard. The decisions of how and when to implement cavalry is tense. Being able to merge block strengths in order to conserve units seems like such a simple idea yet is revolutionary in block wargaming. Overall this was a streamlined block game with some innovative concepts that change the overall flavor of the war. I definitely need to revisit this one.

RATING: 6
The '6' rating feels a little rough - I felt like there was a lot of good stuff in PDS, and the tension levels are generally pretty good - but the game is also unquestionably a bit of a mess. The rules are horribly incomplete and unclear in a lot of places, which makes it tough to play. The game itself feels like a "spare parts" game constructed of mechanisms borrowed from a lot of different Columbia games.

It's still pretty fun - those mechanisms are good mechanisms - but it's a bit incoherent as a whole, and pretty long given how dicey it is. The supply cards are particularly swingy.

I dunno. It's not a bad game, if you ignore the horrendous rules problems, but it's not that inspiring either. I think I'd just rather be playing Crusader Rex, Wizard Kings, or Rommel in the Desert.

Defenetely my favourite blockgame. Deep in history without becoming boring, not as easy as an intro-game but not that complex as a just-for-grognards game. It's a mix of the cleverest and most reliable blockgame-rules with some good and incisive innovations. It has not the great fame it deserves. Great graphics, great materials. I simply love it.

RATING: 7
First game was a mess.  To hard to understand the rules.  And the fortress mechanics are strange; formidible in defense, weak is sieges.  Was charitible in the initial rating since we only played once...but I only played Friedrich once too, and the game blew me away. EDIT - score solidifying around a 7. Second game (solo) went much better.  The fortress rules, rather than encouraging too many too random sieges, actually work very well once you understand the strategy of using them properly (only small forces should ever retreat into a fortress, larger armies should stand and fight or run away).  I still don't like the battle board very much, as it takes too long and doesn't add much to the game (Columbia's A-B-C system would have worked better) and the game is simply too long and wears out its welcome.  There are nearly 40 turns (5 per year for 8 years).  At most, there should be 4 turns per year.  See my full review on the game's page.

After a first game played...Simple game on the subject. The game works well even if rules are not well organized and sometimes blury.Luck is an important part of the game (especialy for sieges) and terrain is very easily lost. Everything is subject to fast changes all the time. Bad board conception, spaces are way too small to fit the moving armies.
Traded it away.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tentative rating after one slightly botched play. This is a reasonably good block game. Definitely not a simulation along the lines of [i]Clash of Monarchs[/i] but not as difficult either. You still get the general historical sense of Frederick bouncing around to win individual battles without ever really getting very far strategically.

There are a few things I don't like. The most glaring issue is the often ambiguous rules. A 21 page FAQ for a 12 page rulebook is a bad sign for any game, but we generally managed to muddle through. The other issues are that leaders are just good units that don't play a larger role in battlefield success. There's also nothing to tie in the historical (monetary) reasons for going after Saxony. It would have been nice to see that tied into the RP system somehow.

Still, for all that, I'd try it again.

Gorgeous take on a classic gaming situation. I like the battleboard rules since it abstracts musket combat in a better way than anything from Columbia. The first edition rules are a mess, but the latest update has filled most of the holes.

RATING: 5
Nice board and blocks but the rules need some attention -- they are vague in places and proved poorly organized for reference. Had little of the slashing march and counter-march that I expect of this period -- instead we were slogging up road after road for yet another siege. Compares poorly with the brilliant Friedrich. Rating might go up a point if this proves just to be first game blues, but if my wargame buddy wasn't eager to give it another go to rescue his investment I doubt I'd ever play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
excellent production: map and blocks are high quality.

the game, however, has four strikes against it:

1.  France and Russia are overrated on their ability to attack Prussia.  There is no downside to using these forces to simply attrition the Prussians, even while suffering decisive defeats.  In the actual SYW, Russia and France specifically avoided bloodying themselves for the benefit of Austria.

2.  The rules as written are quite poor.  The FAQ is larger than the rulebook. A living rules set that eliminates the need for an extensive FAQ would fix the problem.

3.  The British support for Prussia is too easy to lose, and losing two cards out of 7 is overrating the British support.  Prussia gained more from holding Saxony than they gained from the British and this is not even included in the game.

4.  The Prussians need more actions than the allies (not less) to recover from the losses the French and Russians are going to cause to give Freddy a chance versus Austria.

RATING: 6
Okay: Strategic - 7 years war - Easy

Plus:
-Board & cards are nicely done
-Accessible: a system in the line of Columbia Games
-Battle map: nice addition to the exisitng ones. you can retreat, reinforce and play cards.

Minus:
-I am not (yet) convinced about this one and should play it FtF in order to give ma final verdict. So far it is just okay.

Did not touch it in the past 2 years. Sold it.
Firts impressions are very good, will update after more plays.
I have been playing and I really like the atmosphere the games capture. As Prussia you can dealwith Austria easily the first few turns but then.....two massive armies at your doorstep in 1757 turn 3.....I have not played but I can imagine the feel of desparation that must have fallen upon the Prussians. So at this point the game really starts! 

Update: interesting concept and fortress play a vital role (as does bypassing fortress!) but the game limits options for movement / strategic choises (friedrich does an excellent job here).

So in the end the perfect game would be a cross over between Friedrich and Prussia's Defiant Stand.

RATING: 7
Rating based on solo play only.

Nice addition to the block wargame genre. Borrows a lot from the excellent Hammer of the Scots, but excellent production values and the interesting situation of trhe Seven Years' War make it feel very different. 

Prussia must make the most of the first few turns when only Austria is against it, with an offensive against Dresden and (if time allows) Prague being a good option. This will give Friedrich a good points cushion, which he will need later in the game.

Things are not so easy for Friedrich after France, Sweden and Russia enter the game, as he is now heavily outnumbered. However, each side has the same number of plays per turn (driven by the cards), so it's unlikely that he'll be troubled by all of his enemies at once. He can probably defeat and heavily damage any one of the opposing armiores, but if the cost of the victory is too high (in terms of damage to his own forces) one of the other forces may be able to capitalise.

It's now beholden on the Allied player to make the most of his numerical superiority by recovering lost victory cities and going after Prussian ones. As there's a good chance that the Russian and Swedish armies will drop out of the game before the end he may want to make the most of them while they're still around, capturing Konigsberg taking the fight to Prussia while he can. If the Russains can wear down the Prussians before they bow out it should make it easier for the Austrians and French to recover early losses and advancing into Prussia itself.

Fortresses (and sieges) add an additional element to the game, and are neatly handled. No fortress is invulnerable to siege, but they can slow down the conquest of a city, possibly long enough for a relief force to be mustered.

The only downside is a lack of clarity atound the effect of cavalry in the combat rules. The designer has posted updates on BGG and ComSimWorld but there are still some ambiguities where players may need to decide on their own interpretations. Further clarifications would be appreciated.

Great game, played for 5 times and it is only getting better and better. With each play new options for both sides reveal so no game is same,

I must admit rules have some holes in them, but designer is active here on geek and providing answers very fast. Once you get through them mechanics are clean and clever.

Aside from theme (which is mainly atractive only for europeans) I do not understand why this game does not top rank.

It is blast to play, moves fast, looks awesome. Highly recommended.

Excellent, tight, tense, block wargame about the 7 Years War. Worthington has outdone themselves with the gorgeous mounted map and counters. The battleboard and cards are also excellent. It doesn't get a '10' because the battleboard rules are just now getting fleshed out and there are no three or four player rules. Highly recommended.

Almost a really neat game.  I like the battle board a lot and the different modifiers that help the Prussians and hinder them.  But battles are all or nothing affairs.  Unless you withdraw in the first round of combat, you will get slaughtered.  Maybe that's how other block games are (I don't remember that being the case), but it makes the game all about maneuver and sieges.  There are very few nail-biting battles.  Also, the replacements are a bit off:  you can very easily build entire units at full strength in home cities, but it's very difficult to bolster armies that have been bloodied in battle. All in all, though there's a lot to like, there just isn't enough meat on the bone for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like block games, as they are essentially games of maneuver where the key decisions are when and where to accept battle with how much forces for how long. This fits perfectly with the hidden information inherent in the block mechanic and the only detriment for my personally is, that I am not a big fan of hidden information games generally. Plus the block mechanic can begin to feel generic as it gets applied to more and more battles and campaigns. This game suffers a bit from unclear rules,

strong columbia block game.  leans toward Roman Civil War (as opposed to Napoleon) in simplicity of mechanics.  interesting, tense strategic situation, but i worry that over repeated plays it may feel to "samey" from game mto game.  the move declaration rule strikes me as inelegant, and makes the initiative less valuable.  RCW seems (at this point, at least) to handle initiative better.

I have owned and played three games on the SYW:  1) SPI's Frederick the Great, 2) GMT's Clash of Monarchs, and 3) this game.  (For the record:  SPI's game was wonderful; GMT's design, dreadful.)

PDS is the best of the 3 with wonderful and fitting card events, good overall design perspective, and a tactical combat system that truly does justice to 18th century warfare.

This is, however, not a perfect game.  Rules, as originally written, are simply a mess, requiring a total rewrite.  Really pleased that the designer has shown excellent support of his product by answering questions and updating the rules.  

That said, I turn to PDS when I have the "7 year itch."

I was truly surprised how much I initially enjoyed this design - it has quite a few subtle and clever concepts that evoke the period and that also make for smooth play. The Battle Board works out fairly well, with a little common sense applied (some other general rules need some clarification and common sense, as well). 

However, my rating is lowered due to continuous rules ambiguities - the designer is not on the same page as the publisher.

Overall, this is a step up for Worthington - the excellent production values are matched by solid gameplay, but the game ultimately ends up being just short of a good release.

RATING: 6
While the mechanics of the game are very good, the game itself can feel extremely linear at times and the action is slow, which is a problem for a game which takes this long to play.  The slowness of movement makes tons of sense for this era, but it does drastically limit your ability to act or react as you would like to.  The best part of the game is probably the combat system, though the luck factor will literally make or break you to a greater extent than your strategic moves.  I am not a fan of the fortress rules, since they fall too easily and don't do anything to protect Friedrich's flanks so that he can go out and accomplish something in between rolling dice against incoming hordes trying to flank him.  Though none of the cards are bad, none of them are particularly interesting and so the game does not have as much character as some other card-driven war games.

Playing as Prussia in this game involves mostly just reacting to the other player and hoping that your die rolls go well.  If I were to play again as Prussia, I would be able to have a slightly better time with it, but I still feel that the game is overly linear for the Prussians and not as much fun as it could be.

PDS's contributions to the block game genre are neat: stand-alone fortress units, leader activations, the Frictions of War table, supply issues, the way that cavalry is handled in combat (via the battle board), etc.  It's certainly worth owning both this and Crusader Rex, its sister "siege combat" game.

The only real negative is that, if there's no decisive victory early on, the game can be quite long.  I never intended to reenact the 7 Years' War in real time, but this one can come close.

The game is absolutely beautiful looking, and looks like it might be fun to play. I only tried it twice, and although I'm not that familiar with the war in Europe the game was like playing in a total fog. As others have pointed out, the rules that came with the game are a mess. If the publisher had come out with some 'living rules' in a rewrite I would have stuck with it. Over a year after purchase there was still nothing so I abandoned it.

I later purchased "Friedrich" and think that game is a masterpiece. The games are entirely different but I learned more about the Seven Years War in Europe from setting up "Friedrich" than I did from playing "Prussia's Defiant Stand". I have since sold the "Prussia's Defiant Stand".

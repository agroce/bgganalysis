The simplicity of the mechanisms hide a surprisingly long and tight empire game. Military strategy in the game is less about tactical victories as it is about posturing, logistics and border enforcement. Have played it twice to first player elimination (at around 2 - 3 hours of playtime with first time players), but would definitely like to play to the bitter end. It's an impressively elegant design. (With a pretty poor rule book :/)

Fantastic game play with amazing components. I like how everything ties in nicely together and each players turn is pretty fast. 

While there is a possibility to turtle, the capitals are located close enough and it generally does not pays to turtle.

The randomness of the dice can be brutal. Looking forward to more plays.

Purchased Amazon $35 free shipping.  Steal.  Great components, manual is pretty decent as well, but the translation from Italian to English is woefully lacking in polish.

Solo variant is ok...not much more than a training mechanic where the AI storms the player's stronghold.

Plan on playing a 2p game in the coming days.  Final rating dependent upon results.

I was really looking forward to play it, as I was following the kickstarter campaign before, and expected a lot from this game. Unfortunately the gameplay was far away from my expectations.
Just to mention few of it's weaknesses, which make the gameplay suffer:
- Very bad rulebook. You have to read through several times to understand, and I am not a newby at boardgames...
- The playing time is extremely and unnecesserily long. Very long. Just imagine: you have up to 6 workers. Each of them may perform 2 actions. Then you can also have soldiers. Two actions each. And mercenaries. And you will have to think of your move after you see others moves... So closer to the middle of the game it slows down terribly, waiting 5-10 minutes for each player to make single move.
And it makes the gamplay slow and boring
- The randomness of the hexes coming around your city screws up this complex game.

Otherwise could be a promising game with some good ideas, but it lost the chance to become this kind of good game.
We were really suffering during the gamplay, as experienced, euro gamers... And after 2 hours of suffering gave it up to play something else. :(

Missed opportunity. This game needed a better rulebook, a better art treatment, and lots of more development to streamline it further and elevate it to a very good game. It has solid mechanisms and it seems well balanced, in fact it is a pity that the whole is less than its parts. Feels uninviting and dry after a while, I really do not like all these micro-turns of resource gathering and recycling. And it's certainly not worth the investment to fiddle with the rules and learn the game. Pity..

Will not seek it to play it again, but might do so if asked (and I remember the rules still).

I really enjoyed this. Combination of area control, war game and economic euro. Similar is some ways to clash of cultures (but without the tech tree). Can see this one getting a lot of play in the right setting. It could however go quite long with four players.

I will need to play the game again as the explanation during Spiel 2013 was, as is so often the case at the stand of Giochix.it, botched. From what I could make out the author took bits and pieces of other games: a bit of transportation from Splotter, a bit of discovery from Civilization, a bit of hex lands from Catan, and so forth, and then brewed this amalgam with rather bland artwork. I'm not sure this process left Romolo o Remo? with redeeming features of its own... but in order to be certain I'd need to play again, as I said earlier.

No rating as a consequence.

Opened, punched, played once (solo). Pristine condition.

Includes "God Demands" and "Hidden Terrains" expansion. 

LOTS going on here....worker 'placement' (movement), area control, resource management, tile (hex) terrain discovery/usage/control....and then there is the matter of BATTLE! Plain old face-to-face, my army v your army. 
Gorgeous high-end wooden bits, nice n thick cardboard on tiles, coins, and "characters"-

In MANY ways, this is probably what Archipelago might have been...dump the stupid I-don't-know-what-the-end-game-or-even-the-scoring-categories mechanic and the broken evolution cards and add a rulebook that MOSTLY makes sense. I can see this being a slow riser that will be around for a LONG time.

Also for sale.

2014-03-25 : Totally under-developed game - there are some good ideas in there, but they're buried under a mountain of stuff that shouldn't be in there. Its greatest sin is that game-killer of being a long, fairly complex game and then have totally random stuff in there - the tiles - that can screw you out of a win. 
Original rating of 5 lowered to 1 after finding out how publisher Geochix treats customers with complaints about missing parts.

I have played it five times (twice 2p twice 3p and once 4p) and several others with the solitaire mechanics. I liked it very much. I should recognize its rule explanation tend to be a little long, but most of them makes sense thematically (well, although it is nice, the market adjustment is odd) Ienjoy the importance it gives to building a power center around the capital and its dominion: most of the buildings provide nice advantages, but they might be even built just for increasing the capital power. As in many other cases, in the characters segments there are excelent, good and just ok examples, but you should consider them very closely due to their strategic advantage and final point award.

Joc de desenvolupament i exploració amb losetes hexagonals. Similar a un 4x "eurogameitzat". Té diferents tipus de recursos, de treballadors, construcció de edificis amb efectes diversos, sel·lecció de personatges amb poders, batalles, mercat, etc... La victoria es pot aconseguir de forma militar, eliminant els teus rivals, o mitjançant punts de victoria al final de la partida. El sistema de mercat funciona molt bé i simula perfectament la saturació i la especulació.

El final de la partida pot arribar de forma brusca i sense que hagi donat temps a cap enfrontament militar. A més a més, totes les partides son molt iguals entre elles i tots els jugadors desenvolupen la seva "civilització" de manera molt similar, el que resta rejugabilitat.

Los jugadores van expandiéndose por un territorio hexagonal en el que pueden crear construcciones, recolectar recursos y batallar contra otros jugadores, hay un mercado de recursos.

El sistema de batalla es curioso. En función del número de unidades que tengas sumas un poder de ataque/defensa. De un set de tokens con diferentes habilidades eliges una en secreto y te ayuda sumando poder, haciendo una baja, permitiendo retirarte ... Luego se retira. Hasta que no las usas todas no las recuperas.

La otra cosa diferente que tiene es que los edificios no son de un jugador, sino que pueden ser usados por todos.

While I really enjoy the game, this was an absolute flop with my wife and I'm growing tired of simply playing solo.

Despite making a few mistakes with the AI character units, I really enjoyed the game.  It feels almost like a lost civilization title by Splotter.  That "simple yet complex" feeling that both "Roads & Boats" and "Antiquity" exude is present.

Interesting civilization building game.  Has a bit of the feel of Roads and Boats in that you spend a lot of time grinding out an engine to exchange for things that let you grind out your engine more efficiently.  Feels like multiplayer solitaire until it very suddenly does not and you are fending off enemies and planning attacks.  The ramp-up is well paced.  I have played with four and feel that this game might shine with two so that the individual turns come more quickly (certainly on a first play).

RATING: 5
Some cool combination of market economy with random terrain for exploration, construction development, and dice less combat with order tokens. The game runs better when the players have time to complete the game. Slightly boring for wargames but certainly a step realistic above normal Eurogame.

First play:

Seemed like you could get arbitrarily screwed for no fault of your own by:

1.) A river suddenly appearing on many tiles around your tower (thus removing valuable building space from you)

2.) A type of resource/area missing near your tower area

The game has some interesting ideas and a nice thematic feel otherwise I would have rated it even lower.

Laborious.  Really hard work for what is a highly detailed, iterative civ game.  Antiquity does this far better, skipping the needless micro-management to leap straight into the functional meat of gameplay.  In contrast, this game muddles along in micro-management for far too long, with continual bookkeeping getting in the way of any sense of progress for far too long.

I've only tinkered with the solo game, but enough to know that I don't want / need to bring it out into a multi-player environment. It's a game of a million micro-turns, of slowly gathering resources and converting them into means to gather resources faster. Then converting them into means of gaining VPs - of which there's two million ways - and/or building a military presence and perhaps trying out the player elimination approach. All buildings are "common", per Roads and Boats / Neuland, so that's been done before, and player elimination in a micro-turn resource game doesn't sit well with me. In the end, I'm not sure I want to play a game that has two million ways to earn VP's - maybe it creates a game space rich with possibilities (which is my loss for not exploring), but my suspicion is that rewarding everything rewards nothing.

Have a feeling that this will either be too abstract, too brain-burny and too boring for me, or I will think it's one of the greatest games ever.  Reading the rule book has made me think that either of these outcomes are possible - probably leaning towards thinking it's excellent.  Will depend on what happens when I play it.

One solo play through - If players can persevere past the initial fiddliness, I think this could be a classic.  Some fantastic things going on here.

EDIT:  Yes, it's definitely brain-burny, fiddly and somewhat abstract, but it's also strongly thematic and bordering on being a genius design.

Includes the 'Gods Demands' expansion and the 'Hidden Terrain' expansion.

RATING: 7
Lightish civilization game set in ancient Italy. Players have to use their pieces (workers, soldiers, explorers) to expand their civilization across the modular board, revealing different types of terrain as they go. Only the workers can be used to perform actions, such as gathering resources, constructing building and trading with the market. The key to the game really is in the construction of buildings as these bestow greater strength on a player and allow for more efficient use of actions. The winner is determined by totalling victory points from a number of sources but primarily from the amount of influence a player has been able to assert over the playing area (this is determined by the power of their capital city based on how many buildings have been constructed there). Point are also awarded for population, characters acquired, money and so forth. 'RoR?' has its strengths as a game and there is a definite balance that needs to be found in trying to construct buildings whilst not being left open to attack from opponents, but the game does feel a bit clunky to play and other games, such as 'Deus' do this sort of thing in a more polished way.

It is strange that buying resources on the market does not influence on any prices. 

The bonus points for being first and second in different categories should be eliminated.

Mercenaries + Foederatus seem to be extremely strong: let's hire four mercenaries (using two workers paying 4 coins) and crash an opponent during 3 turns at no cost.

Number od plays: 2 (W1, L1).

Awful. Very underdeveloped. Super random with no way of recovering once you fall behind. Bad rules. Frustrating. I can't believe it's got such a high average rating.

De bonnes idées, mais aucun combat dans notre partie. Le jeu ne semble pas pousser à combattre. Faudra que j'y rejoue pour me faire une meilleure idée.

With a character that totally breaks the game, this one was a huge disappointment made even bigger by the fact that the game sounded really intriguing. The Praedo is way overpowered. Maybe without him it's not such an unbalanced mess but with this much time spent on explaining and beforehand reading through the terribly structured rules I'm not willing to invest more time to try and find out. 4 people unanimously agreed to call it quits

* Gets bonus points for a very supportive and constructive game designer. The session we played With the Praedo was a 3. There's good in here, our experience was simply marred by what we felt and still feel is one single terrible element.

My first play was unbalanced due to Praedo character that my opponent picked up at the start; since than I wasn't able to improve my city; the rules should be more clear; have to play it again

Weuro.  There are no niceties in this game.  It's not about namby pambiness, it's about land grabs.

Bought on clearance at 7D for $16. Looks complicated, but I was very intrigued by the setting and components!

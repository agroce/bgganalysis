I still have a lot to explore with this new edition of Saint Petersburg - there are so many variant options provided in the box. Indeed, I'm finding it a little overwhelming and am yearning a bit for the simplicity of the original package (I traded it away when I heard of this new "enhanced" edition). Most disappointingly of all, the new artwork is atrocious in places, with poor proportions on the portraits and some scary looking individuals featured. The original had extremely odd, child-like drawings - it wasn't pretty but it did have a lot of charm, which is absent in the new edition.

None of this, of course, changes the fact that St Petersburg is a classic Eurogame, with the pacing of a modern deck-builder, a very simple ruleset, and some lovely strategic decisions.

Very clean tableau building game! Never checked out the first edition because of the artwork. Seems I shouldn't have been so judgmental.

RATING: 7
5 plays / 3,4,5 players

LIKE: Quick downtime, fun, some engine building. Players can control what runs out to end the game (somewhat). Buying cards and managing your tableau is fun. The market adds a nice bit of strategy and interaction.
DISLIKE: The end can come quick. Minimal interaction. There is some luck in what cards come out later. You may not be able to upgrade your shepherd if you have no control of the turn order. Paper money is not so great. Market does add time to the game, but it is a valuable part of this edition.

OVERALL: The game reminds me of a bit Splendor and Nations, tableau engine-building. You could use your hand reserve for blocking another player. You could slow down a round by not buying any cards in the previous round. Subtle dynamics.

Usually I find the "[property=2004][/property]" mechanic to be very boring, but the addition of the market phase makes it more interesting. [thing=156943][/thing] is the only "[property=2004][/property]" game that I actually like.

Avoided it for a while. Better than I thought but didn't have any real "wow" factor. Still, I'd play it over a lot of other stuff so a solid 7 seems about right. 

New version has alternate mode with extra phase. Have not tried it, but have heard awful things about it.

Definitely not my cup of tea... the necessity of getting 'green cards' early in the game does not allow options for diverse strategies and even if expansions may solve this problem, there is no way to catch up with a runaway leader. Still, not a bad game, just a personal preference.

COMMENTS ON THE BASE SET (I.E. FIRST EDITION): Probably the quintessential euro-economic engine building game, even more so than Race for the Galaxy. The higher randomness and the player-driven phase structure of the rounds in Race means that its often better to accept some inefficiency just to leach off other players. Saint Petersburg seems to lack this same trade-off, since the round structure is fixed and in very round cards of every type will appear. Thus its better to go for the more efficient card possible. One the plus side, it's not too rules heavy (I think it's quite elegant for a game of this type) and isn't overly long. However, it strikes me as even more multi-player solitaire ('race'-like?) than Race for the Galaxy (although maybe I just not seeing how the interaction really work). I might want to get this, except I'm not sure of its balance and re-playability.

COMMENTS ON THE SECOND EDITION: It's great. The box insert is pretty good, keeping the money and the different cards separate. Just be careful when transporting the game, as they can get out their slots. You'll definitely need to bag all the little cardboard bits.

The new artwork is fine and perfectly serviceable. I don't really care about the "real" people on the game cards, but it's not really a problem.

The new market phase is a great addition. It can serve as either a small additional income generate phase or another point generating phase, depending on the cards you get. The kicker is that, unlike the building and aristocrat phases, the points in the market phase increase by each round, starting from 1/0 points to 6/3 points by the sixth round (doesn't increase from there, but I found that games often don't good that point). As well, it's an area majority mechanism, where first player gets the full amount and second gets half, rounded down.

This adds some new strategic and tactical decisions, as you could either try either points or money, and then try to dominate either a few categories and just place second in few others.

I would disagree with the rulebook, and say that you can just go straight ahead with the new market phase, even with new players.

All in all, a great second edition. If you don't have the first, just buy this edition. There's no reason to buy the first other than aesthetic reasons.

Nagyon korrekt újrakiadás, sokkal többet nyújt, mint a régi. A jól bevált taktikai-stratégiai sablonok (pl. elején zöldre gyúrok, aztán nemesre) nem működnek automatikusan, mert sok más játékelemre kell figyelni. Talán túl sokra is. Mindent együtt nem is mertünk kipróbálni. A piac önmagában is sokat ad hozzá, szerintem nagyon jól sikerült és ötletes. A modulok pedig... A játékvégi bónuszpontoknál (5.) jó ötlet, hogy több lépésben hozzuk meg a döntést arról, mire kérjük majd a bónuszt. A 6. modul pedig gyökeresen megkavarja a megszokott játékmenetet és minden taktikát felrúg azzal, hogy egész egyszerűen nem engedi tovább bizonyos pontokon a győzelmi pont jelzőnket, ha nem teljesülnek az előírt feltételek (amik játékról játékra változhatnak). Ez óriási ötlet, de nagyon nehéz és szenvedős lesz tőle a játék, csak kemény SztPétervár fanoknak ajánlom. Mi a piacos részt próbáltuk, ezzel a 2 modullal, meg a két kis promóval, és így is 3 órás lett a parti (3 fős) a szokásos 1 óra helyett. Tehát kifejezetten nehéz, AP-veszélyes változatot is játszhatunk ha úgy hozza kedvünk, de persze a régi hagyományos változat is játszható, a 6 modul szinte korlátlan variálhatóságot biztosít. Az 1. modul a régi kiadás bankett kiegje, a 2.3.4. pedig különféle újabb kártyák. A tábla kétoldalas, a kivitel igényes, a papírpénzek is egész vastagok, a grafikus pedig rácsempészett a kártyákra jónéhány társasjátékos hírességet (Chvatil, Feld, stb.)
Összességében egy nagyon nívós újragondolása született meg a játéknak, magasabb szintre emelve a régi játékot, aki rongyosra játszotta a régit, ez az új annak is kihívást jelent majd. Egyetlen bajom a szabállyal volt, egész pontosan a 6. modullal, volt egy félreérthető rész, de persze ennyi újdonságot nehéz letisztultan tálalni.
Még eszembe jutott a külsejéről 2 dolog: a doboz szuper, a kártyák bugyizva is elférnek, minden pakli számára külön fakk van. A felülépítős lapok viszont nem nagyon különböztethetőek meg az előlapok alapján a sima lapoktól, mert az árukat bekeretező kis téglalap elég halvány, ez elég sajnálatos...:(
---
Ja egyébként bármilyen szuper is a játék, a Kickstarter mint olyan a szememben megbukott. Csomót várni rá, aztán sokkal drágább mint pár héttel később a boltokban. Oké volt két promó, meg egy plusz köteg pénz, de ez elenyésző a teljes tartalomhoz képest.

A barebones economic engine building game with cards. Simple but engaging gameplay; Remember to make sure you'll get enough cards on turns where you're not going first. Expansion modules reduce the viability of the nobles strategy which could be very powerful in the original. There initially doesn't seem to be that much in this game, but this has actually proven to be one of my favorite drafting games.

I'll give it the same rating as the original. However I will say that I prefer the original.

The market is fine, it works well, but with no more starting money it makes the whole game feel more constrained and restrictive. Plus it's completely unnecessary with fewer than five players, which I rarely play with anyway, and yet the board is much, MUCH bigger for all player counts in order to accommodate it.

I also prefer the art of the original, which had a more classic, timeless feel. The new art is very nice, but is very typical (almost generic) for HiG games these days — really, the art could be for any game. The original art distinguished (and continues to distinguish) Saint Petersburg from other games.

Definitely play with the market expansion and maybe some more of the expansion modules.  The base game is too simple.  Even with the market, I don't think the decisions are that interesting here and I somehow seemed to make the right decisions because I was the run away leader in most our plays.  You can mess with your opponents a little but usually it's by making a suboptimal move yourself.  The rounds feel a bit choppy with a bunch of different phases and although the game does click along pretty quickly it feels a touch long for what the game offers.

   I really appreciate the thought that goes in to designing a game that delivers a rule book that clearly spells out how to play a basic game (Saint Petersburg) & optionally an advanced version (that is, the second edition /w the addition of the Market).

   I found that with fewer players, money is not nearly as tight & the game not quite so enjoyable.  Great game though...

I've always enjoyed this game but felt it was somewhat broken. The market doesn't completely rid us of this menace - but makes it more balanced and even more fun to play.
Great artwork and components - although the money is a little weird...

This is a fun "engine" game.  Turns go rather quickly in a two-player game, but still moves at a reasonable pace when four are playing.  The game is very dependent on building a good, operational financial engine at the beginning without falling too far behind on points, so experience matters A LOT with this game.

I have not played with any of the special modules that were included in the reprint.  Therefore, it gets the same rating as the original game.

I'm fairly well acquainted with the first edition which at the time of writing I've played for about 20 to 25 times. Well enough in any case to realise that certain cards can unhinge the game, but not so well enough to play with the timing of the game (although I've certainly noticed it is there to be used).

This new edition doesn't make me go out and buy it. Immediately noticable are subtle but effective balance changes, resulting in less extreme games. Strategies which work well in the first edition don't work so well in the second, and vice versa. Those are Good Things. What I dislike intensely is that the crisp and admittedly too cartoonesque art of the first edition has been replaced with photorealistic stuff and  'beautiful' embellishments. This has now made it nearly impossible to distinguish replacement cards from ordinary cards; in addition you can no longer [i]read[/i] which cards are on the table, but have to compare them visually, taking up more time you are not spending productively. Finally, the rulebook: the original was a 6 page-leaflet; now we're dealing with an encyclopedia of 20 pages whose layout is so bad that even answering simple questions turns into a frustrating hide-and-go-seek. The disease of publishers succumbing to idiots who want beauty before ergonomy lest the game is considered 'crappy' is threatening to become epidemic. Even though the improved balance is a nice thing to have... the artwork kills it rather quickly. Hence a lower rate than the original got.

Then there is a shitload of expansions to sweeten the package deal. To date I've only played the market, and conclude that it is likely to help in the 5 player-case. With less players... yeah, you get another strategy path to play with, but there's really very little interesting stuff to explore here. Rating: 0 with respect to the base game.

Pros: Comes with expansion and goes up to 5 players. Good quality cards and board, colorful art. Surprisingly deep game play despite quick playing time, very tactical and strategic.

Cons: Money is subpar. I don't like the post-it style glue that held the money together and when you pull the bills apart they curl despite being thicker than monopoly-thin money. I prefer thicker card board style money rather than fake bills. Plastic chips or tiddlywinks might have be an okay alternative.

A bad fit for me - too close to the kind of thing where you have to completely obsess over optimization with a poor sense of what's coming down the pipe (e.g. Le Havre).  While it's loose enough that you can try to just go with the flow and play improvisationally, the sense of being constantly cash-poor is more frustrating than it is productively constraining.  The expansion to five players is a misstep: too much to juggle and keep track of, and too much switching your brain and eyes back and forth from the real core of the game to the "produce market" stuff.  Some games just don't have space to add a fifth player.

RATING: 4
It's nice that their is an expanded version plus mini-modules included in the box.   However, I rate this one point lower than the base game since I found that the expansion detracts from the game.  The yellow cards make the game literally about twice as long, as there are many more purchases to make and less money to do it with.   Two hours is too long for what is fundamentally a simple card drafting game.

Lastly, I am docking this another point for the artwork.   It appears to be photographed, brushed and 3-D rendered.   The end result is about as unsettling as The Polar Express.   I have to wonder if anybody at Z-Man even proofed these character images?   Awful.

As a hardened fan of the original, I have a hard time stomaching the new artwork, but must admit there is obviously more game in this box with all the added expansions.

The 5th market round and included market symbols on other cards is a great additional layer to the game (akin to 7 Wonders Leaders, just adds another round of the same), the purple "mystery cards" and new base cards are hit or miss (some add welcome dynamics and some are too swingy in power).

If you never played the game before, this is the obvious copy to get, yet I would be hard pressed to buy it having owned the original.

RATING: 5
Second edition carries bland and generic art to new heights of mediocrity.  New market phase/scoring mechanic dilutes the theme without adding fun; also increases the footprint of a compact game.  Newly added expansions add clutter and complexity to a tight and simple game without any return in playing enjoyment.  A great game transformed into a middle-of-the-road euro of no particular note.  A word to the wise game designer:  if it isn't broken, don't fix it.

2017-04-05: The new version of St. Petersburg adds 'goods', yellow cards, to mitigate heavy Red-strategy I think.
I like it. I especially 'like' how the timing always seems to be a bit 'off' for you when you end up buying cards that are not in the right 'phase' to be used right away.
This is a classic which is quite speedy on three and unfortunately a bit dry. 
would definitely play again.

The first thing you notice when opening the box of this second edition is the outstanding production value. The insert is fabulous and everything finds its place comfortably in the box (even sleeved cards). Card stock and wooden pieces are of the topmost quality.
The game is the old Saint Pete you remember, with a new coat of paint. The aesthetic is debatable (but so it was the art of the first edition), but the value has indeed increased: now you can play S. Petersburg with or without the advanced market variant, with six included expansion modules, with two extra modules (for backers only?) and if you required it, with the original New Society expansion, that allow up to five players even without the market variant.

Really glad to have contributed to this new edition!

I am jumping my rating to a 9 after just one playing. I have enjoyed St P version one since it first came out with 30 face to face games. I have only so far played with the market added to the base game but look forward to trying out the other options. I might be missing something but it seems to me like the game end is always going to be triggered by the depletion of the worker cards, certainly in the 4 player game. June 2015

Played the base game + market only and even though the game plays differently than the orignal, I can't say it's better or worse yet. Hence the same rating.

I think it adds a good amount of diversion, but I would need more plays to come to a final conclusion. Problem is, I own the original and the expansion and doubt that I will get the new version anytime soon, if at all.

Good game stays good.

I love the original and have played it fairly extensively. Some of the new additions here are pretty good, and add interesting extra dimensions to the usual play. The new market phase is the most interesting, as it adds a whole new deck of cards, and a corresponding stock chart to compete on. The scoring gates are also pretty good, as they force you to play in ways that you normally wouldn't. Some of the lesser modules are not as good, and can be skipped.

I still don't think this makes a very good 5-player game... There just aren't enough cards to justify it, and my one 5-player attempt ended unsatisfyingly on the 3rd round. 

At this point, I am playing 2nd Edition almost exclusively, but I still pull out the 1st in order to play with my family from time to time or introduce new players to it.

I'm not really a fan of the original edition any more. But the bigger board and the added turn phase and the discount cards all add an element.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2015)

Saint Petersburg was the first Euro game I played, I played it even before Settlers of Catan, so it will always have a nostalgia factor for me. I can say I really enjoyed this new edition of the game.

The art is cool although I prefer the old one. The game components are good.

Saint Petersburg has some hard decisions in it, managing the money is paramount and it isn’t obvious what is the best play, I love this aspect of the game.

This new edition has some new modules but as I didn’t read the rules I’m not sure how many new modules are there. I liked the obstacles one, this one can be very hard on a player if he cannot accomplish the goal he won’t be able to get any more VPs. The big change is the new market phase/cards, at first glance I enjoyed it (area majority) but I’m not sure if it was really necessary, perhaps it add more time needlessly. I need to play more to really see, but the idea is neat, however I think you can play without it if you wish so it doesn’t bother me in the least. There are some cards that have a new cost, I think they did this to balance them. I also like the Banquet, but a bit less than the base game, some of the Banquet cards are very powerful so they can be unfair and it adds a lot of play time.

The previous edition was 4 player only, I’m not sure about the fifth player, it makes the game much longer with lots of downtime.  I think I prefer to play with 3 players. Perhaps I will buy this new edition of the game, I always regretted selling my previous copy along with the expansions. 

Current Rating: 6.0

I love the original game (which I rate a 9).  This version is not as good.  A couple of comments:

- The Market Phase is a wonderfully designed phase that would work well in another game, but it drastically changes the game.  In all honesty, I think there is a little bias on my part because I don't like the change.  If I had come into this as a blank slate, I might like it better.  Still, I think this is an example of how less is actually more.

- The Administrators are not near balanced and also greatly change the game.

- The art - I hated the original art the first time I saw it, but then it grew on me.  When faced with a hyper-realistic alternative, I suddenly miss it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
After seeing the new components, all I have to say is that they are gorgous!  The only minor quibble that I have is that the gold box drawn around the upgrade card values is a little thin and can easily be missed.

The added yellow resource cards add just the right amount to make the game more interesting and fresh after many, many plays of the original.  The nice thing is that the original game and rules are still playable with no changes other than the board... and the resource cards and 5th player are considered optional (however I don't see me playing without the new cards very often).

As an added bonus, the Z-Man edition ships with six additional add-on modules, including the Banquet, Assistants, and Events.

The updated BSW version is a lot more intuitive than the old one and deserves top marks, too.  In some ways I prefer playing on BSW.

Still the same game but a lot of additional content which in part was published previously as an expansion, in another part created for this new edition. Slight adjustments are made to the base cards, namely the costs of the most expensive aristocrats and the observatory are increased. 

From the new content, I've only tried the new market phase which adds a majority element into the game. I'm not so sure what to make out of it. It doesn't improve the game, it definitely changes the game, potentially weakens it.

This is my rating for the second edition which is quite different than that for the original edition.  This is the original game plus an added market phase with related stock market and various special purple cards thrown in throughout.  The market wasn't so bad but it adds a phase of competition and gameplay which is different from the soul of the original game and in all honesty doesn't improve the St. Petersburg experience.  

Finally, the artwork for the people cards (green and red cards) is not appealing.  It's obvious that the pseudo photographs are supposed to be depictions of actual people and that's their defining quality - it's not that these depictions are attractive artwork.  They would only appeal to a limited number of people not many of whom are going to be the target customers for this game.  I think the designers went far overboard on their homage to their friends and co-workers.  I have no interest in owning this edition.

+ Easy to teach

- After a few plays when you start to know the cards planning is easyer/less interesting and maybe even feel a bit samey.

Each player "buying" a card makes the game go fast and provides some tension.
As every phase generates it's own income and you need to get your expensive VP engine going you will need to plan ahead and find a good balance and even pivot money->vp throughout the game. A fun game I like to play now and then.

RATING: N/A
In Saint Petersburg, you'll be buying different types of cards: workers, buildings, aristocrats, trading cards, and the new market cards. In every phase, a new type of card will be available for purchase. You'll start with workers, who are good at bringing in rubles. The new market (yellow) cards bring in new resources. Having the majorities in these resources from round to round will earn you additional victory points. This battle for the lead enhances the game experience and expands the tactical and strategic possibilities of the players. In the next phase, buildings can be acquired, mostly granting victory points. Aristocrats provide a mix of victory points and rubles, and also lead to a large end-game point bonus that can't be ignored.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Glad one can still play the base game with this version, and I do like the marketplace as something different. Didn't try any of the other modules so who knows with those. However, the marketplace does tend to add in a bit more AP and make the game overstay its welcome a bit? I also don't much care for the art in the new edition.

Referred to as a card-drafting game, players purchase cards representing different people and buildings that have varying costs and gold-producing abilities.  I'd have to say it's not as deep as the 2.72 complexity rating that users here on Boardgame Geek have made it out to be.  Still, the game offers a variety of choices and a decent amount of strategy.  I've only played it once and finished fourth out of four, but I still liked the game a great deal.  I suggest the second edition over the original mainly because of the updated artwork.  The original looks like someone drew everything in 1970's study hall.

It was ages ago that I played the first edition a number of times. I had just started exploring boardgames of this kind. I remember that I got very frustrated playing it, because I felt I didn't stand a chance to win it. I also found it quite complex to master. 
Now that I played it again, it felt like a light game. 

You need to know which cards you can expect, to know which ones you have to buy or take at hand. So knowledge of the game is important. 
Once you know what you are doing, you can start building your money and points engine. The game has nothing more to it than that. 

I liked the cards of the first edition more than these. Didn't try the market expansion yet.

It is difficult to rate this game because I love the original so much. I don't have enough experience to judge the pricing changes or included expansion mix. The goods phase is certainly a pro from the perspective of having the option, and my one play of it was pretty fun. This game feels very different whenever the rhythm is interrupted, and this is done by changing the player count, the card count, or, we now know, the phase count. The art is a detractor. I love Doris's original art and, while I understand the need to "update" things now and then, the direction they took is not a good one. For the people at least--the goods look fine.

All in all a perfectly reasonable way to play the game, but as long as I have the first edition I won't track this one down.

Really wanted to like this, but it ended up being so mediocre. I much prefer the New Society expansion. This one's new markets just feel like make work, forcing you to do things to do things, but not adding anything really fun or interesting. My gaming group likes SPNS and a couple players bought this when it came out. We played it a couple times. Then never again. No one really liked it. And it won't let you play the 2-5 player complete NS. So it both expands and subtracts from what you can play. Count me as MEH!

I was a little lukewarm on Saint Petersburg after my first play. However, after giving it another shot, my opinion is much improved. This is one of those deceptively simple games that actually seems to have quite a bit of depth lurking under the surface.

I played this one at the Spel fair in Antwerp, owning the original version. I like the original version better: the artwork of the new version distracts your attention away from the iconography. The board is also too big to put on the table. The action cards also randomise it more making for a less strategic game.

I want to start by saying THANK YOU!!! A Well made INSERT that has a place for everything, labeled and that fits Sleeved Cards!!! HALLELUJAH!!!

I had played the original version before and I have to say that I like the new one better in all aspects... to me, the art is much much better in this one...

Also we played with the Market... this adds to the game a new deck of cards that is played between the Worker Phase and the Building Phase and this adds a very cool new way to play the game because it adds new ways to score points in an market area majority in each product... it's also a way to potentially spend more money (if you only manage to get the expensive stuff!)

Really liked this new addition to the game!

EDIT:
Revised rating after another play...

I get the feeling that in this game the Rich keep getting Richer and there's no way to stop that because it's an avalanche... the person generating more money will always be able to get more cards to get more money and the others can't do much to stop it because they simply don't have the means to do it...

at a certain point the leader will just change gears and start to focus on scoring points, and since he has the money he can get those cards no problem... and it keeps repeating...

Saint Petersburg is like a calmer and less chaotic version of 7-wonders.  At 2 or 3 player, it has a tremendous sense of build-up: in your last couple rounds, you can have turns where you make 30+ rubles or 40+ points - which feels awesome! At higher player counts, the arc is less dramatic, but still enjoyable.  The gameplay itself is laser focused: you are putting cards on your tableau or else drafting them into your hand so you can put them in your tableau a bit later.  That's it - for the whole game.

I've really enjoyed my time with St. Petersburg, but I think I'm done with it. It's a bit obsolete at this point, and there are far better tableau-building games coming out now. Not to mention shorter ones. St. Petersburg has always felt overlong. Still, this game is really great, and one of the best Euros of the 2000s.

Played this with some rules errors 2 weeks ago, so was happy to get to play it again on International Tabletop Day and correct those mistakes.

I pursued a strategy of focusing on the nobles with a fair amount of market presence as well and almost no buildings. I came in second place, just 7 points behind first place, and about 35 points in front of the third place finisher. We won't mention 4th and 5th out of politeness.

If was generally agreed amongst my group that this is a good game which 4 out of 5 of us liked. However it was also agreed that it is a bit long for what it is, perhaps this is the fault of playing with 5 and perhaps with fewer this would be less of an issue.

I think I liked the first edition better. The game doesn't play well with 5 because it might only last 5 rounds, and with the way turn order works, the distribution of who goes first and when will disadvantage at least one of the group -- probably the player(s) to the right of the thumbs up holder. The addition of the market took the simplicity of the original to an odd place that, for me, was not welcome.

RATING: 6.3
I'm not going to talk about St. Petersburg, I prefer instead to compare both editions.

In the 2st edition, you have income, points, the only possible discount is because of having different copies of the same card, and there are 4-5 special cards. That's all. Here, they add the market, a whole new mechanism, and many other small modules and things. One by one, none of them is bad. None of them is diffuclt, and all of them add some little aspect that doesn't change the core game. But the problem is: you to start to add everthing and game lenght increases a lot, and you have also covered the game so much that the original mechanics and aspects that made the game great are not recognizable. The original St Petersburg is still there, but there's just too much noise around it.

Money is scarce in the 1st edition, and the decision of when to spend it and on what was paramount; not only to get the cards you needed, also sometimes to make space for an additional card of the next phase, because otherwise you might get none, etc. In the 2nd edition, the market increases the money you get, and at leats with 5 players, you buy 2 cards in almost every phase. Consecuently, the decisions are much simpler and the game loses A LOT of depth.

In the first edition you must control both money income and point income. You start trying to form a nice money making machine and then start to transition into points, adapting the strategy to whatever cards you have available and whatever your rivals do. In this 2nd edition, this feels much more difuse, since you just take the few cards there are left.

The art of the original game was a mix of Russian orthodox and bizantine art that garnered a lot of critics. It might not look good, but it was a nice representation of the historical period St Petersburg is set on. I liked this art and found it special and original. This second edition art is hyperrealist; I'm not repulsed by it, but I don't like the videogame/computer generated look that the characters have, and some of them look really bad.

Lastly, even if the new market rules allow for a fifth player and BGG users recommend 4 players for the 1st edition, I think 3 is the best player count for St Petersburg. 

Conclusion: Even if they are not bad, all the novelties strangle the original game that became famous. The best news is that you can remove them and stick to the contents of the first edition. I only recommend the new things to hardcore fans that look for some variants.

[b]Saint Petersburg (second edition)[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]In St. Pete's you really need to know the cards in all the different decks if you want to compete and the game play wasn't engaging enough to make me want to put that kind of time into it. In the end I did enjoy playing and I would play again if requested, but I would much rather play games that I love which would fit into the same category such as Concordia.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Please note I haven't played the original game and I was playing with a bunch of sharks who new the game inside and out. The other players were telling me about the changes/additions to the 2nd edition and I definitely enjoyed what the new market phase added to the game. I could see how really good players could basically solve the 1st edition game (not that I'd be able too) so the market added another way to score a variable amount of points depending how hard other people pushed it. 

I enjoyed having to figure out how to manage my income, keep track of the cards in my hand and still actually get something done in the game. The game is very demanding and would take a couple of plays before I think I would have a chance to win. It is not overly complex, but it does reward repeated play because there is very little margin for error and if you fall behind you're not going to catch up.

I really enjoyed my first play, but it ran long (at least 2.5 hours). One player had serious AP so I can't really fault the game, but it did detract from the experience. That said I'd definitely like to play this again, but it is not the kind of game I'd add to my collection or recommend to families (it is very unforgiving, especially if you don't manage your income properly).

RATING: 7
I cannot master the strategy in this game and I think it has something to do with the Market cards (don't underestimate them. They can get you serious points throughout the game). Saint Petersburg is all about card-drafting and I've never seen a game employ one mechanic as well as this. Still can't find a way to win but I enjoyed the heck out of it every time I play. Great board, great components, and fun though extremely frustrating to play. The modules provide endless gameplay and chances to employ different strategies.

RATING: 7
I've played this a few times and first it was fun with the new stuff, but the original game is better. Lat time I played people even said this is the worst game ever. I understand their frustration since they have implemented an elimination function without letting you leave the table: What do I mean eliminating? The obstacles of course; you can end up with a situation where you cannot do anything about getting past an obstacle and it's not your fault. The yellow one is especially difficult. 

Another problem with this game is that they have added two more cards in the card row, and have less cards in the decks (since they didn't add new society in the retail version). This allows less rounds and a too short game, especially with five players.

I've only played this game a few times but I have enjoyed every play so far and all the players I've introduced it to have also enjoyed it. I like the engine building aspect of the game and the themes of the cards (workers make money, buildings points and nobles a mix of the two) make it easy to understand simple strategies. I also enjoy the tension of trying to figure out when to switch from money making to points scoring, it can be tempting to leave the expensive cards until late in the game, but they will score you less points, since they score during each round, so taking a big points scorer early on can be very profitable, but it might well bankrupt you!

I'm afraid that I think this game has some of the worst art I have ever seen, I much prefer the original art, but that version isn't so easy to pick up. Plus this version of the game (Spiel Offensive 'Kickstarter') came with the expansions and some extra modules that I may use in the future. Luckily the art isn't that important to the game, but it is quite disappointing. 

Still this is a fantastic game and I much prefer it to similar games such as Splendor because it has that little bit more complexity and depth.

This edition of Saint Petersburg still plays very much like the original, but the market gives players a new thing to think about. Adding majorities to the game was a nice change of pace. I haven't really played enough to comment on game balance, but in this game, I had a hard time catching up focusing exclusively on aristocrats (but I did). The Observatory is still way strong, despite the price increase. I've yet to try any of the additional modules.

RATING: 7
This is a wonderful and elegant tableau builder, where each round is divided up into sections where a single type of card is available for purchase, and then only that type pays out in points and dollars. Then you move onto the next type of cards. It has a wonderful tension about when you should buy and what you should focus on, as you are constantly short of cash and working hard to balance your budget. The built-in marketplace module adds a lot too as you need to worry about placing in different goods majorities in addition to making sure you have the money at the end of the round to grab up some of the high value buildings and nobles cards, and then additionally that you save enough money between rounds to be able to afford the money producing cards that get unveiled at the start of the new round.

I was never a fan of the original edition. The addition of the market adds a level of strategy I really enjoy, partially because it helps take focus off the boring collection of red cards. I'm not a huge fan of the new art, but I really don't care for that old classic euro style either. Basically, this edition of Petersburg gets a solid rating simply for improving on the old one in nearly every way possible, even if some improvements were very minor.

St Pete is a low-luck tactical game that is great at all player counts. The market addition new to this edition is very good and takes the edge of just collecting nobles and make it possible to compete in different ways. Some of the additional modules are dispensable however and I certainly don't see myself including them often, apart from the assignments.

[2 plays] The market deck with its fifth phase between workers and buildings and the market good symbols on cards in the other decks really changes St Pete. It feels much different than all the other cards and revisions previously. Pat game strategies are thrown on their heads, all phases take on a different tone, noble collection is less dominant, and game time is increased.

So far very pleased and intrigued. Looking forward to many more games exploring this.

Az új kinézet szerintem se nem jobb, se nem rosszabb, mint a korábbi volt. Az kicsit talán közelebb állt a világhoz, ez talán kicsit szebb.
A piacos oldalt próbáltuk, ami egy új fajta kártyát hoz be a játékba. hatféle nyersanyagok gyűjthetünk velük és minden körben pontozzuk az adott nyersanyagból legtöbbet és második legtöbbet gyűjtőt. Minél későbbi körökben járunk annál több pontot érnek az első és második helyek. Ezen túl még pénzt is adnak az új kártyák. Nekem ez a rész abszolút tetszett.

5-ös modul: Mindenki kap három célkártyát, amiért a játék végén jár pont. Érdekes és jó ötlet, hogy ebből a játékban pontokat gyűjtve kettőt el kell majd dobnunk és a végén egy marad. Így a játék közben alakított stratégia alapján tudunk közülük választani. Tetszett.

6-os modul: Nagyon megváltoztatja a játékmenetet, ugyanis adott ponton csak úgy tudunk áthaladni, hogy elérünk egy meghatározott célt. Ez kiöli az egysíkú stratégiákat a játékból, cserébe sok pontunk mehet el rajta és lehet nagyon erősen azonos eredmények felé tereli a játékosokat. Ezen kívül adott pontokon áthaladva még plusz bónuszok járnak különböző dolgokért (pl. zöld kártyánként 1 pont). Kicsit hibásan játszottuk, de összességében sem tudom, hogy ez jó-e vagy sem. Kell még vele próba.

Fejlesztői promó: Nagyon korrekt ötlet a játékban egyszeri lehetőségként feltölteni a hiányzó helyeket az éppen aktuális kör kártyáival. Ez sokszor életmentő lehet, nem felhasználva 3 pontot ad a játék végén. Tetszett.

Sürgősségi raktár promó: Egy plusz lapot tudunk még vele a kezünkben tartani 1 pénzért. Annyira nem nagy szám, nem használtam a játék során.

Összességében jó játékélmény volt, de rettenetesen sokáig tartott. Egyrészt a piac miatt mindképp nő a játékidő, másrészt a modulokkal AP veszélyes is lehet a társas. Marad ugyanaz a pontszám, amit az alapjáték is kapott tőlem. Még mindig nem érzem jobbnak, mint a 7 Wonderst.

Mechanically, this game is quite good, and a OK little puzzle, but there is no fun to be had here. Absolutely no shade of theme, whatsoever. I've seen a few people complaining about the art style, but in all honesty, I barely looked at the art once I understood the game. All you care about on the cards is what they give you.

No level of player interaction at all, textbook cause of AP, absolutely HORRENDOUS downtime for what the game is (on several occasions it took 5 minutes to get back round to me, and that was with only 3 other players). I was the only new player at the table and was often the one making the fastest decisions.

As for a 60 minute playtime, that is just not true. With 4, it was a shade over 2 hours after the rules explanation.

In no way is this a game for me.

Saint Petersburg is a great game and the second edition updates the components to be (mostly) amazing quality while also providing updated content to include 5 players with a market phase.

From a simple aesthetic point of view I love the new larger board as well as the updated art work.  I'm sure it had its fans but the old Saint Petersburg artwork, to me, was hideous.  Also, even the updated symbology and pieces make a lot more sense.  Instead of a misshapen bust, chair?, onion??, and...square...this version comes with a hammer, palace, much better bust, and thumbs up to represent the four phases.  So much better.

This edition also includes new rules for a market phase that can accommodate 5 players.  There was an expansion for the first edition that essentially included just more cards for the initial 4 phases to accommodate 5 players.  I think the new phase works well and is a much more elegant solution but like the base game shouldn't be played with any number besides 4 (some people will say 2 is fine, which it is, but I still prefer only to play with 4), I wouldn't play with the market phase without exactly 5.

The only thing I wish they did a better job with was the money.  It's not QUITE paper money but it is pretty close.  It came glued on the side like a notepad and they are small rectangular thick paper.  Like they are almost cards but not quite and still not quite enough to be easy or convenient to manage.  They should have just printed the money as cards or made it tokens.  This is almost as bad as paper money and I will almost always substitute poker chips instead.

The thinky game my wife likes to play. Nice mechanics, a classic. The look of the new version isnt that nice, as the original, the photorealistic look is not for everyone (my wife likes the old version more). But with all the different modules its worth it and the old one was out of print and hard to get.

RATING: 5
Ooh. I did not like the changes made here.

Playing with 5 players; they fifth player seems to be eliminated as their money engine will always be worse than everyone else's. Getting to choose 5th & 10th will obviously give you the worst selection. In round 2 you choose 4th and 9th and so still get lousy cards and so on. Our game only went 5 rounds, so with no compensation for starting last (and in our game, also starting with the upgrade round starting token) that player had no chance to compete.

The number of cards in each set also seems to have been tweaked so the game ended really quickly and the aristocrat phase seemed completely undermined, with no-one owning more than 5.

(I also hate the artwork)

Oddly, the adjustments in Tom Lehman's expansion were [-]removed[/-] adjusted. The market deck is meh. The physical implementation is unnecessarily fiddly. They couldn't make the market tracks go up to 15? Seriously? For now, I prefer the original plus Tom Lehman's expansion.

SP2 missed a great opportunity to expand a great game well.

Even worse than the original Sankt Petersburg. The addition of the market wrecks the game completely. If you are unable to participate meaningfuly in the market early in the game, you will lose, as it is the most important source of scoring.

Rating for 2nd ed game played with Market. Basically, it's not bad, but it's not good either; 1st ed is an extremely elegant and a rather streamlined game in itself, and the 2nd ed doesn't seem to really add anything worthwhile; the best bit is some of the new cards and their effects. Also - as a minor gripe - the cartoonish outlook of the 2nd ed is a bit of an eyesore compared to the old one, which is quite elegant in this respect also.

I think I'm getting rid of this and keeping the old one.

I like the second edition far better than the original. The new market (yellow) cards bring a wealth of new options and allow players a variety of strategies. I often felt in the original Saint Petersburg that options were limited and once you were trailing, you were in trouble because you were essentially going down the same path as other players but already behind. The new market  allows players to forge ahead in different directions and is a vast improvement. I have to admit, though ... I liked the cartoon-like art of the first edition better than the more realistic art of the second edition.

The second edition comes with different artwork (which is great for the images, but absolutely sucks for the icons, which are now barely legible). It also adds a market phase, which for me adds to the game.

I got rid of the first edition because it has a runaway leader problem. I really liked the gameplay, though, so I bought this version when it went on sale for $30 hoping for an improvement. 

Well, the market really adds an enormous amount to the game. In the first edition, it was just a matter of who got the better cards and when. With the market in the second edition, there is real tension as players jockey for position on the market tracks which in turn makes the rest of the game more interesting because you can try to buy cards in order to block others from moving up the tracks. I've read a number of people who say they prefer the old version and I just don't see how that's possible. The market is essential to the game now.

With that said, I'm still not sure about the runaway leader problem. It seems like it's not as bad as in the old version, but it still seems like you can get ahead and play to just keep your lead for the rest of the game by blocking the market and aristocrats.

Sold.

I like the fact that you can reverse the board and play 1st edition style St. Petersburg if that is what you want to do (the only difference in this sense really is some of the cost to buy the cards ex. like the Mistress of Ceremonies which now costs 20 to play, etc).

The market phase really changes up the flow of the new game and you have to really pay attention to your money synergy more than before since I have found that it is harder to get the maximum amount of aristocrats as in the old game.  Paying attention to the market is now key, especially in the later game scoring.

All in all, I prefer the old art style uniquely better, but the new art style is reasonable for what it is (something for the new kids I guess).  If you're into the old original period Russian style art, I would recommend picking up the 1st edition for collectability on the side.

Having said all that, you get a lot of variability here to mix and match to suit your gaming preferences.  Great game.

This is definitely a "gamer's game".  Theme is secondary in this points tussle but still a nice touch and well executed.  So many ways to gain points but you need to manage your income and its sources. Not a total brain burner but there's plenty of strategy. Bonus, its easy to learn and teach. Overall, a very good game.

Box signed by designer and artists + New Society completion pack + extra stack of game money.

Saint Petersburg is incredibly simple, considering how much thought must go into every card you play. You must first buy money generating cards and then use the subsequent payouts to buy victory point generating building and noble cards. The difficulty is in the incredibly tight economy. Investing in money generating workers leaves you penniless when it comes time to buy the VP generators, but skipping the infrastructure of your economy money leaves you cash poor and unable to compete later in the game. Knowing when to switch from one to the other is very tricky indeed.

This second edition of the game adds a new market phase and majority scoring opportunity, spread across five different goods. The new phase slips in almost seamlessly (although it does slow the game down a hair) and adds even tougher decisions about when to invest and when to save your money for later.

The game is also a breeze to teach. It's a great one to have in any collection because I think it is a nice bridge between light and medium weight Euros, since playing it is easy but playing it well is hard. I'd recommend it to anyone.

Played with classic rules, it's always a good game.
The art, on the other hand, is such a horrible step back or down or in whatever dimension you use to describe a disaster. If you want to play this game with classic rules, stick with original.

See my original version comments. This reimplementation adds and combines a lot of game. I like the scoring track check points, the commodity track and the market adds a ton to strategy dynamic. All the new content plays well together, there is also; choosing a personal objective to discard, select events that offer one time or game end benefits, and assistants. I love the constant frustration of too little cash for too many needs in a buying war during the different phases. For the record, my wife preferred the original artwork as an art history buff.

Engine-building at its finest. It's just so satisfying to see how that engine hums and ramps up as the game goes on. The game play is so streamlined but the simple decision of when to buy what card is wonderfully agonising.

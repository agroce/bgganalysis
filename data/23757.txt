RATING: 7
I like this game. It is quick and feels like you are playing hockey. The score stays low like a real game and there is tension as you wonder if you should use your high cards first to bring the puck up the ice or wait for a good goal.

Great fun....with just the right playing time.  Even my 4-yo plays this;  we just use the numeric cards and a few other simplifications...it's helped him learn the concept of "greater than" and he knows how to decide who won based on the cards and move the puck accordingly.   Manages to "feel" like hockey to quite a surprising degree...

I been playing this one mostly with my kids but I'm starting to see how this is a better game than I originally thought.  My rating may go up with more plays.  Dice Tower recommendation.
Played this now with an adult and it really does give you the feel of a hockey game.  It's a light card game with a bit of hand management strategy.  Rating moved up to 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Light hockey themed game that offers some of the feel of the back and forth nature of hockey. The 'high card(s) wins' format of play works well enough but because you're not always filling your hand with cards you will rarely see any of the card combos beyond a pair. Knowing when to pull out your big guns and when to play your small cards is really half the fun with some reading of what your opponent might have in their hand and bluffing elements spicing things up a bit. Plays fairly quickly. Nice game for an NHL nongaming friend since the core element int he game (poker hands) is well known to most everyone.

RATING: 6
If you like Card Football, you'll most likely like this as well!  The hand management in this one is a little less important, and has been sacrificed for more up-tempo gameplay to fit the hockey theme.  The gold spaces (I forget what they're called) that trigger events also add a lot of fun and unpredictability to the game.  Decent fun, and I'm not even a hockey fan!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a good mass market hockey game that would appeal to hobbyists that are fans of the sport. It's a simple game but it evokes a nice feel of the battle for puck possession. There's some nice touches such as the events triggered by the brown squares and how you can auto-succeed if you have a shooting/save result with your team's logo. Also, you can pull your goalie, which is excellent.

RATING: 5
Not a bad little game, actually- despite the fact that it's a pretty sorry design it captures a good sense of back-and-forth on the ice and there's a few good decision points.  Anytime a game is based around a standard deck of 52 cards you know that the authors are probably not the most, say, "worldly" about game mechanics but nonetheless the simple War/Poker elements work OK in context.  The special abilities (based on the teams actual abilities I guess) don't seem to work quite right and not being able to trump a pair with a higher pair is a little weird.  The production is pretty nice and it's NHL licenseed, and I don't see any reason why it wouldn't be a good gift for a hockey fan who might not be aware of games beyond the usual mainstream fare.

Love this game. Sure, the cards have to go your way, but timely play of what you have in your hand makes it pretty tense for the most part. I play this with my wife and it usually goes down to the wire. Love the Hockey theme. Not a difficult game and it plays quickly.

[Note - I have not tried the new All-Star game variant, which could create hand-management decisions]

Unlike the spectacular game Card Football from the same publisher, the hockey incarnation is an anemic luck-fest. Few opportunities to do, well, anything but blindly play a card and hope you edge out your opponent's card. Dull, little strategy, and certainly not worth repeat play despite attractive components.

Ok game after one play. Although the game ended in overtime, there was never any excitement to the game.

RATING: 5
Basically it's a War variant, with a dash of Poker thrown in there.   Winning cards or hands will move the puck along, and there are some special squares that give "Icebreaker" events from the deck.  Line changes, time-outs, and pulling the goalie are all included in simple but effective ways.   Scoring tends to be a little too high - we've seen 7 goals happen fairly easily, but overall it's a decent implementation of the theme.

Really fun because me and my wife are huge Red Wings fans.  Seems like there is a really good 2-player game here. Turns go fast and the back and forth of moving the puck is quite a satisfying player interaction.  Wish there was more hand management involved (more back and forth between players on a given turn).

Fun card game using poker hands to control puck and score.  In contrast to its "sister game" -Card Football- it is very hard to get winning poker hands because you must make many plays before refilling your hand. This makes the "power hands" much more rare --which is a fun alternative to the wild swings of card football.

The kids have a blast playing this and so do I. We can't help and add the color commentary whenever we play and the game emulates the back and forth of a hockey game. I like Card Driven Games and landing on the the Icebreaker squares really adds to the tension and fun.

The components ranged from ok to very good. 
I liked the quality of the cards and the NHL puck (a round black wooden token) were great. The mounted board was ok but the period and scoring markers (translucent plastic chips) didn't knock my socks off. There's potential for pimping the game components here (perhaps some team markers and better scoring, period tokens). 

I can also see some potential for rules variants here.

RATING: 6
Light game where you face off against an opponent (or 2 pairs of players).  Each hand is played against a single opponent, the winner moving the puck up the ice as per the instructions on the last card played.

When in the shooting zone, hand winner determines if it is a goal or a save.

Your 5-card hand is refilled only when there is a stoppage in play or you run out of cards.

RATING: 7
Fun little diversion.  Not weighty at all, but that is ok as I have plenty of weighty games.  Good flavor and hockey feel, what with the back and forth and puck control attempts.  The rulebook could've been written a bit clearer as it leaves a couple of important details a bit muddy.  Nothing horrible, but, could be better.  The gameplay is the height of simplicity and the small, yet attractive board is perfect for travel or playing in bed.  Solitaire rules are a plus.  I wish the flavor text was more than just flavor as a shot on goal isn't really defined by the flavor text of "blistering slap shot", just "Queen beats 7".  The flavor text gets ignored far too much and this can detract from the theme of the game.  All in all, a good hockey flavored card game and fun for the 15-20 minutes it takes to play.  Any longer and it would be monotonous, but as short filler it is lots of fun.  A close game can get very tense.  Nothing worse than losing on the very last card of the game!  Just like a goal in the last 10 seconds of a real game:  Heartbreaking.  With a little tweaking/house ruling/errata this could be great.

I prefer football to hockey, but much prefer this to Card Football.  Although the system is similar, the mechanics match far better to hockey.  Here, it isn't just about the card play because the board position matters.  You don't have individual players to worry about as in Street Soccer, but this creates a similar feeling of the ebb and flow of the game.  The penalty rules give the feel of power plays without a lot of complexity, and there seems plenty of room for tactics within the card play.  It's no Strat-O-Matic, which I have played, but tell me SOM makes you feel like you're playing or watching a hockey game.

My wife and I like to play this together. The game has a great hockey theme; integrating elements like face-offs, line changes, penalties, break aways, etc. If you enjoy hockey, I recommend picking this up. It's a nice, light card game with relatively easy rules. If you're looking for a deep, strategy game, this is definitly not for you. My only real complaint is that the instructions aren't written very well.

This is basically War with a thin layer of theme. I've only played it once, and I would need to play it more to be sure, but there didn't feel like there were many meaningful decisions.

Edit: It's like War, in that you both play a card, and the high card wins. You have a hand of cards, though, so it's not a blind draw like in War.

RATING: 8.5
[>5 plays] This is a clever little hockey game. Each "play" is based on the boring game of war, but it's got some strategy to it because of multiple cards to choose from. Knowing when to play the small cards and when to bring out the big guns is important. The "ice breaker" spaces make for some free plays. Your dwindling cards (you don't refill until a "stoppage" or you run out of cards) simulate a tired line. The deck is your "clock" (for a longer game, go through the deck twice per period). The "choose your team" option is also quite nice; it gives you the ability to make big goals if you can use them at the right time (and sometimes you can't). 

There are also rules to play multiple cards, such as pairs and trips, to beat a single card (unless that card is a team logo card, which beats everything but power hands). Power hands are five-card combinations (straight, full house, four of a kind, flush) that result in an instant goal. They're very rare in the base game, but the "all star" rules on the publisher's website make for more hand management in the game.

It's not a perfect game, but it's a very fun game. I'm a big hockey fan, so that might bias my view. Please see my full review for more details: [url]http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/120062[/url]

Glorified version of War that I purchased for $3.  It's a decent game and the use of the "poker hands" does give a bit of tension and mind games.  

It says it can play with 4 people, but it feels more like an afterthought.  This is a two player game that can be easily be played with non-gamers.  However, if you are more involved in the hobby, other two player games like 7 Wonder Duels would be more to your liking.

RATING: 5
Rating is for basic rules delivered with the game. The rules require some knowledge of hockey to be able to interpret them correctly and play the game, and there are a couple of ambiguities (luckily the designers were very nice and happy to answer all my questions). I don't like the breakaway tiles, they are too easy to hit from face-off and greatly increase the number of goals scored in a game (greatly unrealistic when the final score is 10-6). The poker/hand-management aspect isn't as good as the other designer's offering (card football) simply because the hand refresh don't happen frequently enough and is very difficult to time. This increases the luck factor and adds a small amount of frustration to the game. 
Still, this is the best hockey game out there after Slapshot, and the advanced rules (available on their website) seem to correct most of my complaints, although I have yet to try them.

I'm a huge hockey fan and this game creates such a great back and forth system of up trumping each other that is great.  Do I save the Ace for a needed save or do I drop it now to get me into the shooting zone only to have a high card of 7 to take the shot?  There still is a lot of luck, but you don't notice it in this fast paced game.  Games are short too.  A MUST for Hockey fans.  Rules can be a bit hard to get at first (when to refill, penalties, power hands, etc).

Rating based on one play -- and that with almost all the luck turned against me.  Unlike CSE Games' Card Football, this game does not let you refill your hand after every play, meaning it is much harder to tune your hand for big plays.  Unfortunately with that loss of control goes most of the meaningful choices in the game.  It's not entirely trivial, but neither is it as deliciously tense as it's older brother.  If more plays don't turn something up, this is getting demoted and thrown on the trade pile.

This game plays like playing War with a standard deck of playing cards.  The cards also have some special ability printed on them to reflect hockey plays like a penalty.  You play by selecting a card for a showdown.  The highest card wins.  When you win a showdown, you can advance the puck.  When you get into a scoring area, you can take a shot on goal.  It resolves like a showdown.

Feels similar to Incan Gold or Diamant - simple push-your-luck with some beautiful components. The game hints that your should be bluffing throughout, but there is no strategy in that aspect of the game - no real way of determining who is lying or telling the truth. Nonetheless, it's a fun, simple game.

RATING: 7.5
Really, really fun and funny.  Similar to Welcome to the Dungeon, where you're pushing your luck when you go forward, except it's really funny when the captain hopes the ship crashes.

There isn't a feeling of "Take That", since you're not technically screwing people over, so I see this going over better with non-combative game groups.

Wasn't the biggest fan of only drawing 1 card at the end of a journey, as it's possible that everyone at the table ends up crashing on the first stage many times in a row JUST to build back their hands, but overall I enjoyed this one and would gladly crash again.

RATING: 8
This is really a fun game and one that comes with a lot of strengths! It's very portable, it can accommodate a good number of players, it's easy to teach, quick to play and very exciting. I was really impressed by it.

I should also give props to the publisher for the production values here: the cardboard is tick, the artwork is beautiful, the airship standee is just awesome. All these elements together make it really pop on the table and that's not something that usually small games are able to achieve! Gameplay-wise instead Celestia is a very simple push your luck game... but it might be the best one I've ever played! The reason why I like it so much is its sort of team aspect, that then turns quickly into a back-stabbing fest when the time it's right. It just makes everything so very exciting.

I'm really didn't expect to like Celestia so much. It's a very good game, a great way to spend a few minutes between bigger games or just to chill and have some fun. Two thumbs up!

I liked this game right away, but ugh, I think I will have to drop my score on this.  I really really wish I liked it more.  I need more plays before making the decision.  

I think my problem is that I'm trying to rate it like a real board game, but it's really designed to be a filler.  As a game, it's terrible, but as a filler, it's pretty good.

An entertaining press-your-luck game that's slightly more complicated and long than it needs to be. It also has memory elements (needing to remember what other people have rolled and played) which I dislike. For this kind of experience, I think Incan Gold is faster, simpler, and delivers just as much (or more) excitement.

An interesting little push your luck party game that's fairly simple to explain and quick to play. This would really benefit from having some player aids to summarize the different power cards though as each one has certain rules about when and how it can be played which are not explained on the card itself.

Similar to Deep Sea Adventure, but much, much better.  Sure, you can get lucky with the cards you draw, both cards to play and cards that score you points, but it's a push your luck game so, ahem, there's bound to be some luck involved somewhere along the way.  Really nice little filler that immediately went on my games to buy list.

Je zit met zijn allen op een boot, en we zijn beurt voor beurt de kapitein.
De kapitein gooit met de dobbelstenen, en moet zien of hij de juiste kaarten in zijn hand heeft om de dobbelstenen te counteren.

Na het gooien van de dobbelstenen, mogen de anderen beslissen of ze aan boord blijven, of afstappen en voor "lagere", maar zekere punten kiezen.

Eenvoudig spel, kort, zeer mooi vormgegeven.

RATING: N/A
I tried this game at my local game shop. As the rules are written, it's fairly disappointing. I had a great hand - four wilds, among other stuff - but was completely unable to do anything impressive with it. The problem is that other players kept crashing the airship before I could ever take over and use my hand effectively. As a result, one player got the opportunity to run the airship a good distance at the beginning of the game, and then just played conservative to secure the win. With the other players crashing the airship before I could use my hand, I was powerless to ever catch up.

I am going to play test some rules changes that I think will improve the mechanics of the game, making it much more strategic, and removing some of the randomness so that players have more control over their own score.

1) Increase the winning point total to 100 (because I think the below rules will make for higher point games)

2) Play as normal to start a leg. The captain rolls and players announce whether they will stay on or disembark.

3) After all players announce, the captain then picks one of three options:
   a. Pay the cost rolled on the dice and safely navigate the ship. Play resumes as normal.
   b. Announce an effort to save the ship and offer to pay part of the cost shown on the dice by specifically naming the portion of the cost they are willing to pay.
   c. Abandon ship by agreeing to pay none of the cost. (For both this option and option b, the captain *could* have the cost available and choose NOT to pay it.)

4) If option b or c is chosen above, players on the airship are asked in turn order if they wish to cover the remaining cost. A player must cover the entire remaining cost. Each player has the option to try and cover and if more than one player agrees to cover, the player with the least number of points wins the chance to cover. If there is a tie for the least number of points, then the option to cover is awarded based on turn order. Each player only gets one chance to offer to cover. Once their choice is stated, they may not revisit that choice.

5) If no player covers, the ship crashes and no points are scored for those remaining on the ship.

6) If a player covered, resolve the cover thusly:
   a. If the captain covered part of the cost, the covering player pays the remaining cost, but then may randomly take the same number of cards from captain's hand. If the captain had enough cards to pay the covering player, the captain stays on board the ship. If the captain does not have enough cards, the covering player takes all of the captain's cards and the captain must disembark. The captain scores points as if they disembarked willingly.
   b. If the captain abandoned the ship by paying none of the cost, the covering player pays the total cost and does not get to take any cards from the captain. The captain scores as if the willingly disembarked.

7) The covering player then gets the final option to kick one player off the airship, which could be the captain if the captain made a partial payment and is still on the airship. If the covering player does kick someone off the airship, that player scores as if they willingly disembarked and may draw one extra equipment card immediately.

Why I think this will work:

Using these alternate rules, a player had much more control over their destiny, especially if they have a good hand. You are no longer entirely reliant on the other captains to make their rolls. Additionally, you now have to strategize about whether you want to pay a cost or not. Paying a partial cost could result in a covering player pulling your jetpack, but then keep you on the airship to earn more points. Since some cards are revealed by offering to save the ship, savvy players can keep better track of who has what, which adds depth to the decision making process. Finally, the captain can abandon ship even if they can pay the cost if they think no one else can, keeping players from racking up points. Sure, it hurts the captain, too, but if someone is running away with the game, the new mechanics can help equalize the total and force you to play carefully.

Like I said - it needs play testing. Covering is a pretty simple mechanic, but I may need to tweak the point total to keep the game length juuuust right.

I will try to post results, but if you get a chance to try this alternative, let me know!

Neat push your luck game.  4 players was fun, but it seems like the chaos of more players might actually be even better.  The art on the game is fantastic, although I do wish the ability cards had better symbol on them so it was easier to tell what they do.  This one is probably another keeper from Essen 2015.

AVOID. 2015. 2-6p. 30 min. Re-imp of Cloud 9.

BGGer sgosaric says:

A reworking of Cloud 9 by developers who didn't understand the original game and tried to make it "better" by adding all sorts of gamey ideas to it of which all missed the point of the original.

Original game's premise: push your luck game. Kinda like Incan Gold/Diamant - each turn players decide either to continue deeper to more rewards or scram and take what they already have (reached). The twist of Cloud 9 is that one player knows whether the round will be a failure or success (and this player - captain - can't run away), while others have to guess by deduction, memory, logic, hunch or whatever there's available. 

Celestia adds "twists":

1. In original game all colours are evenly spread, now the distribution of cards is uneven. This is somewhat balanced by more joker cards, but... The idea is to make the situation more deductible by logic (odds and that). But... what's wrong with reading people, huh? Developers tried to make this game of odds more about beating the game than the opponents. Shame on them. 
This is the only change from Cloud 9 that can't be removed. 

2. Scoring. In original game each new space is worth more points. And there was a score track (so scores are visible). 
Now there are scoring cards - in each location you can get as much as before. Or MORE. You lucky bastard. Why? Because. Oh and there are some special treasures in first locations that can help you mitigate the whole pushing of luck for one round. 
Yup. Idiotic. If this is a game about pushing your luck and odds and trying to be better at figuring this out than other players, why just dispense of it by giving players point they didn't learn by risk or being more clever than others? 
On top of this - scores are now hidden, but the game ends when somebody reaches 50 points. [facepalm]
You can get rid of this feature, but it will be a bit wonky. Making a PnP score track would be the best option. 

3. Action cards. Oh. My. 
There are cards in the deck that can make you avoid taking risks or make rerolls. Err. Why? Why mess with the push your luck core of the game? 
Okay the original original game (schmidt edition) had some take that - but didn't mess with the odds and variants which were more take that were costly (using normal cards to pay for effects, so it wasn't just "take that as I have a card", but something available to everyone if they wanted to pay the price). 
So instead of letting odds mess with people, here people mess with odds and so another dilution of push your luck core of the game. And psychology and doublethink this brings with itself. 
Developers trying to make the game better by adding gamey stuff with "options" is a hint they might gave been blind to the options already in the game. 
At least you can remove this part with no problem. 

So: if you can get Cloud 9, get it. Or make your own. 
Celestia manages to dilute the tension of pushing your luck (which is the point of push your luck games!).

Note: I would rate Cloud 9 probably around 6.0

Rating down to 1.0 because: My rating of 1.0 means "hope nobody does this again" which in this case means inept game development. Now Cloud 9 is probably a game I'd enjoy, but this decadent gamey lunacy ... oh, dear.

Quick and fun press your luck game. Players take turns captaining an air ship. As you travel to a new city you roll a set number of dice and face what hardships are on their faces. Passengers can get off at a city or take the chance the captain has cards in their hand to face the challenges. The farther the city you get to, they higher the points your get, but you get nothing if the captain can't make the challenge and you all crash and start over again. First player to 50 points wins.

On my turn, I have no strategic decisions to make, since I cannot get off the ship and no way to mitigate my dice rolls. When it is someone's captain turn, the game doesn't provide any meaningful strategic parameters for me to make a decision with. Get off or stay on...based on what??? How many cards they have?

Play Deep Sea Adventure instead, which is way more fun.
Though this does have an over-the-top bathtub/ship.

Played Cloud 9 years ago and this is the successor to that. Beautiful game that draws people in but it feels totally random. You are rolling dice to see if the ship advances to the next level and then when you are not the captain you have the option to get out to score some points based on whether you think the captain has the cards that match the dice or not. You have so little information about what the captain has that it is really just a guess on your part. In some rounds the captain was out on the first or second leg due to a bad roll or we were up near the top with good rolls in a row. Compare this to something like Incan Gold where you know it's 2 traps of the same type from a single deck gives you a bit more information about the likelihood of busting each turn. I'd rather play Incan Gold over this, but I'd still play it if someone brought it to game night.

The rulebook is needlessly vague, the gameplay is basic as can be, there is a lot of variability in the hidden scoring cards to make this a luck fest, the function of the special cards is really not self explanatory resulting in constant rulebook diving, and whoever thought it is a good idea to have special abilities in the rewards card pile needs a bit of straightening up. The graphic design is very nice, as are the components. With so many great push your luck / bluffing games out there, it's a no go. The basic idea is good, but the game lacked development. I'd take Diamant over this any day.

GAMEPLAY: :star::star::star::star::nostar: 
A very fun game of bluffing, double bluffing and triple bluffing! Sometimes the game can feel a little long if you are only managing to score small treasure cards, 50 points can seem quite a long way away!

Absolutely BEAUTIFUL game and that 3D ship really makes it!

RULES & TEACHING: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
As it's a bluffing game it's not ideal for people to have to ask what the cards in their hands do incase they forget... all this game needs is some player aid cards, you can find some here on BGG though.

Ce jeu est un jeu de confiance. Faites-vous confiance à votre capitaine ? Lui, bien sur, vous dira "Avec moi, votre sécurité est assurée". Mais, a-t-il raison ? Celestia est un jeu, plutôt joliment illustré, de "Stop ou encore". C'est à dire que soit vous faites confiance à votre capitaine, qui conduit une sorte d'aéronef en 3D, et vous continuez avec lui dans l'espoir d'avoir des beaux trésors. Soit vous le lâchez et descendez pour prendre un trésor moins important, mais un trésor quand même. Car si le capitaine est incapable d'aller à la destination suivante, c'est le crash pour tous ceux encore sur le bateau. Crash = zéro trésor, Evidemment. C'est un jeu fort sympathique, facile à sortir.

There's not much of a game here...most of your decisions will come down to luck, although late in the game you can manipulate things a bit by how aggressive you are. There's also a small bit of hand management, but not much...and keeping your eye on who is doing well and who not can influence your decisions...ok, maybe there's a bit more game here than I thought. I rarely want to play when it is suggested but always find it enjoyable. It gets the nod over Incan Gold.

#1 push your luck for 3-6, best with 4. (Behind the Throne is the best push your luck for 2p, imo.)

The theme of Celestia is wonderfully expressed. It's so satisfying to jump out and watch the airship crash without you, or to get everyone to stay onboard and then crash it yourself :)

I brought this to my brother's house to play with his family, and ended up leaving it there and buying another copy for myself. His daughters couldn't face life without it!

Great fun!

You take turns piloting an airship and get points depending on how far you can make it along the "board." (really a series of cards) You have to read the other players to determine whether they actually have the ability to fly the ship. If they don't have the right cards, everyone goes down and nobody gets any points. You get to tip over the giant, beautiful airship piece and dump the meeples everywhere. 

If you get off before the ship goes down you get points depending on how far the ship travels. If the captain somehow stays on the ship and everyone else jumps out, he can ride as far as he likes and jump ship before crashing. 

The game is beautiful and simple. I'd love to play this with my family - hopefully the English version comes out soon.

This one doesn't quite work for me. I feel like I'm missing something. 

The game was a gift for my daughter and she likes it, so I'm pleased about that.

Unlike other push-your-luck games like, say, Incan Gold, where you can sort of gauge how likely you are to fail each round based on the cards that have already come up, you just roll dice here. And the odds of rolling a particular die result are always the same each time you roll, even if you just rolled that same result 100 times. I don't see much basis for one's decision to stay or leave the airship, and this means few to no meaningful decisions. I'm guessing that you could even calculate mathematically which island/departure gives you maximum odds of success, and then just play the game the same way every time, always leaving the airship at that island. But where's the fun in that? (Granted, there are a few things you can do to improve your odds by a bit. You can count cards, count the number of cards in other players' hands, and play the occasional power card to save yourself or hose your opponents. But those factors still don't provide any interesting decisions and they're fairly minor compared to the mighty randomness of the dice.)

On the plus side, I like the grabbing of treasure cards in this game vs. picking up the gems in Incan Gold. Constantly dividing up the gems between players was quite cumbersome and time consuming. The notion of the treasure cards was one of the things that drew me to Celestia.

Love the idea, love the artwork... but I still feel like I'm missing something. I'm hoping that it will "click" after more plays.

2016-05-21 : It's not often you come across a game where every single mechanic is totally random, but this one sure is : from the captain rolling the dice, to his ability to counter their averse effects to the players guessing whether or not he'll be able to do so to the victory points/action cards the players get if they guessed correctly. And if it isn't random, it's obligatory - as in the cards the captain must play. A game with an almost zero decision space. If it wasn't for the cute airship component, the good graphic design and the short playtime this would be a game to totally avoid, as it is, it's simply a 4
2016-05-21 : Seems we got taught the game incorrectly : the captaincy rotates within every voyage, not after each voyage. This is a crucial difference which turns this game from a turd into something where tactical play can make the difference. The luck factor is still huge, but at least now it's a game. Rating upgraded to 6.

I own and prefer Cloud 9. The slick artwork is a good thing and is a huge improvement over the cartoon feel of Cloud 9, but it feels like the overworked the game to be too gimmicky. Adding variable scoring on each jump and "take that" effect cards, I feel, water down the experience and tension of the original. I would rather focus on the pure gamble and deduction of outwitting my opponent and not rely on chance for a win. The added rarity/frequency of the colored cards does add a nice addition to the game.

I would recommend getting the original Cloud 9, but would not begrudge anyone from picking up Celestia (just take out the effect cards).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Though the art is great, the gameplay does not stack up. Too much card draw luck for my tastes, and certain power cards are objectively stronger than others, something I distain in games like this. Also, the blind race to 50pts is frustrating. I'd rather play with face up treasures or over a fixed number of rounds. Its has more interaction that most purely press-your-luck games, but not enough to keep it afloat. I'd recommend Deep Sea Adventure over this any day of the week.

A simple push your luck game with some hand management and a little take that. I liked the art and the component quality. I didn't like that there are three luck factors in this game: the die roll, the value of the treasure cards, and the draw of your hazard cards. Too much luck for the limited decisions you have. Instead of Celestia, play Deep Sea Adventure, Incan Gold, or Can't Stop instead.

A neat little game. A good gateway game with some fun trust/luck/gamble situations. It was good, but not something I'd hold on to for a long time. There was a too few interesting cards, and a bit too much luck in the card draw. 
With a few changes this could easily go to 7 or 8. But it was a bit short of its target.

I was still interested in this game after my initial disappointment. I had a few ideas to try to make it work for two. However the editor/publisher dude seemed to take my comments very negatively and on a personal level. This culminated in a comment that it didn't work for us because we played it wrong. Won't make THAT mistake again. Promptly sold it.

[b]Rating based on - 2 plays, 2 player[/b]
I've wanted to try Cloud 9 because it looked like fun but since I do most of my gaming with 2 and that is minimum 3, it was a no go. I was very excited to find this game locally, and awaited it with much anticipation. The gobsmackingly beautiful art did not disappoint. What DID disappoint was the gameplay with 2. It was kind of flat and did not really generate a sense of excitement for us. We have other push your luck games that DO so we know it is possible. Some of the cards (Disembarkation and Hard Blow) seem quite selfish and mean spirited. Maybe that's the point? In that case, I would suggest this game for a regular game group who likes that kind of thing. However, this strikes me as a game that is too light for most gamers, so I'm not exactly sure what the intended market for this game is. I feel it's light for ME and I LOVE fillers and family weight games, but playing this with casual gamers would make them feel dumped on. In addition, the art lends itself to play with children but the gameplay doesn't. I don't want to teach kids it's OK to step on other people to further your own goals. Will put it through its paces over the next few months and update my rating after more plays.

RATING: 6
As far as fillers go, this one is up my alley. It takes the press your luck element of Incan Gold (stay or go) and transports it to a die roll. 

Each turn one player is the Captain and they roll some dice with symbols. They must play cards to match those symbols in order to advance to the next "station." Before they play cards -- and without anyone knowing if they have the requisite cards -- players can decide to bail (and grab a VP card at the current station) or stick with the captain and go to the next higher VP station. 

What makes the game fun is the Captain tries to bluff people. If they do have the requisite cards, they don't want anyone going to the next higher VP station. If they don't, they want people sticking around to crash and burn with them (rather than bailing and grabbing a VP card).

Good filler fun. I should probably pick up a copy.

This game is a blast; very light but at the same-time very engaging.  If you are after a competitive push-your-luck style game and don't mind a little bit of chaos, this is definitely a fun one that is worth a solid look.

A common comparison is to Incan Gold/Diamant; while both a solid games Incan/Diamant feel more dry and mathy, there is a lot less luck involved in such a way that I would compare it to Blackjack; you know much of the elements and you are playing off of known odds.  Celestia, meanwhile, is more random/lucky/swingy, but in a game of this nature it feels more engaging, sociable and well... fun.

Quick little push your luck game, where you are gambling on whether a player has the right cards to get past the obstacle or not. Bail out and you pick up a treasure, but stay on for the ride and move on (hopefully) to a richer town. 

Interesting ideas and plays very quickly. Pieces are very over the top and over produced but it is interesting, and I like the art style. I expect this will play very differently with the full compliment of 6 players.

Die Franzosen können Art Direction: lieblicher, hinreissender, zaubervoller wie CELESTIA lässt sich kein Spiel gestalten. Das Wolkenschiff ist von zartmeinender Schönheit. Wie bei ABYSS so liefert auch CELESTIA den Beleg, was Artwork ausmachen und ein Spiel anheben kann. Es macht solch eine Freude verliebt auf das Material zu blicken. Schade, dass sich das nette Spielchen auf einer doch eindimensionalen Ebene durch die Wolken bewegt und kaum über einen "Glaub ich/Glaub ich nicht-Mechanismus" hinauskommt und im Schönheitswettbewerb gegen ABYSS in der Summe als zweiter Sieger den Tisch verlässt.

I'm guessing that I'll be saying the exact same thing that everyone else who rates it in the middle says: beautiful components, meh gameplay. The only decision you make is whether or not to "stay with the captain" and that's based entirely on either nothing or on your ability to memorize all the cards everybody has played so far. Otherwise, if you are the captain, virtually 99% of the cards you play are per-determined by the dice. And the ones you can decide to play are either mean to everyone else or too beneficial to you. And only luck-of-the-draw decides whether or not you get those cards.  And there is no sense of progression as the game forever resets like some Twilight Zone version of hell.  And it drags on for too long.  That being said: beautiful components.  But components do not save a game. I'm guessing if the components were crap I would rate this a '4' - so maybe they are worth something.

Even the most curmudgeonly crack a smile as the propellor spins to the broom brooming sounds emanating from the captain.

RATING: 7
Simple push your luck game that has some enjoyable bluffing added in. 

Components and art are quite nice. I do wish the special cards had text on them, as new players tend to repeatedly forget what they do. As there is so few in the deck, it's not a huge issue, and a couple of printed player aids seemed to fix this.  

Overall a very fun opener/closer game that is often requested to hit the table.

Celestia is a great game.  It may be my most played new game of 2016.  It has gone over well in every game group that has played it.  I have never played a bad game of it.
I will buy the expansion as soon as it is available.

What a pleasant little surprise.
It is incredible what good art direction can do for a game. This simple push your luck game is made much better through solid art direction at satisfying game components.
I generally hate dice, in here I don't even mind them.
Absolutely recommend for almost any group, great with 4 players or more.

Sure, I'm not the audience this game is looking for, but since no one in my group was excited about this, it doesn't help.

It's just push your luck with some take that without any information. All you can do is counting cards and try to cheat the probability.

RATING: 7
It's good & incredible beautiful!
Basic push your luck mechanic, with dice & a little bluffing.

Only problem (except for the theme & awesome artwork) it feels like Diamant / Incan Gold while being fiddlier. The dice rolling & constantly taking of cards is a bit more cumbersome than drawing one card in diamant.

So i'd go with Diamant because it plays quicker & delivers the same experience.

There is a little bit more strategy in Celestia due to the special cards.

RATING: 7
Played a lot and always goes over well with many. Literally feather-light as far as my tastes go, but still enjoyable. My main beef with the game is the power of the Wild cards. The fact that they MAY be played really gives the pilot too much power. Went ahead and cut half out due to those who have them just letting the boat crash and burn more often than necessary, making the game longer than it needs to be
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
Basically same game as Cloud 9.
Main difference is you get a points card when you jump out of the boat. The card could be worth slightly more than what its normal value. Also this is the only way to obtain the WILD card that gets you a free success. (in Cloud 9, the WILD card is in the regular deck of cards.) I like that change for obtaining the WILD.

There are also some "special power" cards mixed with the regular cards, but they're nothing big. I actually take some of them out because they don't seem to add much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A straightforward push-your-luck game with nice components. You need to make a more-or-less informed decision on whether the captain can overcome this turn's hazards, or get off the ship now and take a lower value prize. The value of those prizes perhaps varies a little too much, with the scoring as tight as it is getting a higher than average value prize (or two) can decide the game. Still, a fun atmosphere (no pun intended) and at 30 minutes, no risk of going on too long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very good family oriented push your luck game with a charming steampunk outfit and an optional take that element (IMO the game works best as a light family game - especially with the expansion, that adds a bit of a semi-coop feel to it); the only (very) minor cons: the dice (too light, plastic), card icons (very small, and sometimes difficult to see) and the character cards from the expansion with no special ability description printed on. Overall, a very charming, lighthearted, delicate & pastel, improved version of "Cloud 9".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A good filler in the style "push your luck" ... It has an interesting proposal, because even though it is competitive, there are times when you play it as a coop, but of course, only to meet your interest to get the best treasure in the travel ... It's worth to play.

2016-07-11 - I'll readily admit that I need to play this more before finalizing my rating. We played one time, and I think we did everything correctly, but we found it pretty boring.

For such a light weight game, this is surprisingly fun to play. It works well for kids and borders the "party game" realm with a slightly more strategic bluffing game (think Sheriff of Nottingham or Skulls). Then again the bluffing doesn't matter and you could basically play it with everyone staying silent (which is both a good and bad thing). 

Recommend not playing with the Jet pack cards or simply house ruling them to not work when you are the captain. They are kind of broken in an otherwise well balanced game.

2015-10-13 - 7 - Very light push your luck almost cooperative game (but you can be a little bit mean to others) with very pretty artwork. The cardboard aircraft is a nice addition. This is a realy good game to show to non gamers, but gamers might find something interesting in it as well.

2015-10-17 - 7->7.5 - It's pretty deep and works fine even with two players!

2015-10-19 - 7.5->7 - Another change. But it's a solid 7, which stays in my collection.

2016-01-31 - 7->7.5 - This game has long legs and it's pretty funny!

2016-04-02 - 7.5->7 - How about another 7?

2016-12-29 - 7->6 - I guess I played enough of this one. It's fine but I would choose something else myself probably.

2017-01-27 - The biggest problem with this game are special cards, which are difficult to explain and to remember what they do, especially for casual players. Everyone gets Jetpack, but others are pain to remember who, when and what can do with them. Pictures on cards don't help as some are easy to confuse with others.

Very ligh Push Your Luck game. I'm usually don't enjoy this types of games, but Celestia is one of the best in his category. The players suffers/fails together and the frustration is not as high as the majority of other games in the genre. There is luck, but with a lot of important decisions to make. The game does not play you. You play the game and your decisions matters.

This game is beautifully designed; I've had several people walk by and comment on how nice the pieces look. Physically being able to construct the ship is an added bonus.

Great game! My family has such disparate gaming appetites, it is very rare that we play a game that everyone likes.

I'll play this anytime.

1 partida en Jesta 2017.

Vamos a bordo de un barco que va navegando entre islas. En cada intento de "saltar" a otra isla debemos decidir si desembarcamos (porque pensamos que el capitán no podrá conseguirlo) o permanecemos a bordo (porque confiamos en nuestro capitán, que va cambiando en cada turno). A medida que vamos llegando más lejos, el premio puede ser más suculento (en puntos de victoria).

Un party visualmente muy atractivo, tanto por el barco en 3D, como por las ilustraciones, que parece muy divertido con muchos jugadores y que, por desgracia, probé siendo 3.

A low rating deserves an explanation and it is a simple one. Cloud 9 is 10 times the game that this is. In cloud 9 players can make informed calculated decisions based on limited information, in Celestia the scores are not public and there is a wide divergence as to what points you may pick up on any given space, the whole game has moved into lottery status with no control. Given a choice I will always play Cloud 9 over this game and in all honesty I will be happy if I never play this version again.

People LOVE this game, and I sort of get it. I like the semi-coop nature and push your luck elements. THIS is how push your luck should be done. I just don't like the huge range in the piles. I feel like I always get the low values, and people will win by pulling like the highest or second highest from every stack they visit.

An odd game of betting whether or not the current player thinks that this game is a coöp or not.  There's a ton of luck, from the cards to the dice, but it mostly mitigates itself due to the option of betting against the current player and jumping ship.  What makes the game interesting is unfortunately what breaks the game: the special action cards (jet pack, etc.) are much of the fun of the game, but unarguably whoever gets more of these will win the whole game.

I like to play this with a larger player count (4-6). There isn't much depth to this game but it still creates tough decisions for the player - knowing when to abandon ship.

Pros: The 3D ship and modular board are cool. High player interaction.

Cons: Poor iconography on cards - throughout the game, everyone constantly refers to the rule book for their action cards.

Shocked at the low score on BGG - This is a great little game - A quick Push your luck / bluffing / card n dice game - Plays 2-6 and the more the better - still plays good with 2 or three.
ther are 9 cloud cities each with a treasure deck - the further you can go the hight points the treasures are worth.
Players all travel in an airship each taking it in turns to pilot the ship (roll dice) and hazard sybmols rolled must be paid for by cards from your hand,After the pilot rolls he states wether or not he can make it to the next city,he can of course lie -  if the other players dont think the captain (pilot) can meet the symbols rolled they can jump out and take a card at the cloud city they are at.then the captain plays his cards or crashes - if he plays the ship moves to the next cloud city -Firts player to score 50 wins - Great opener or to finnish a session of with

RATING: 8
This game is excellent for families and player counts of 4+.  An elegant design with press your luck.  The thing I really like is that it has a social element to the game without the need to really sell/act out your position to other players.  People who can't or don't want to sell/act don't have to worry.  Players can use basic deduction to determine when to stay or go most of the time.  So basically you can just relax and be playful when you are the captain.

Probably my favorite of the recent trifecta of press-your-luck style games (which include Incan Gold and Loot and Run).  Where this game especially succeeds is with reveals.  There's a good reveal with the dice roll and the "how confident are you in your captain?" layer brings a bit of humor into the game.  Components are a mixed bag...the ship is a unique marker but the card artwork could have been a bit more clearer.  We found ourselves having to review the rulebook often to remind ourselves what each did.  A reference card would have gone a long way.  Would also have liked a few more of the special power cards in the deck to shake things up.

Out of the push your luck games, i'd say this one is my new favorite. I enjoy the dice chucking element as well as the ship figurine. Being able to jump my meeple overboard, spin the propeller on the ship, and chuck dice seemed to help players immerse themselves into the gameplay a little better than in other games. Some of the special cards i think try and do too much though. A wild card?, sure. A jetpack?, maybe. But more than one or two and i think it begins to overly complicate the simplicity and intuitiveness of the game. Also the artwork is good, which lies in stark contrast to Incan Gold's artwork, which was ultimately it's death blow for me.

Not bad, but quite repetitive and I didn't feel like there was any information to work with. For push-your-luck or bluffing I'd play something else. Very pretty, though the space used for artwork could have been used for bigger iconography. I did also feel that if you had a hand of too many of the same card, then you've a good chance of getting stuck with it for the whole game.

A beautiful looking game that's easy to learn and quick to play, while offering a fun level of simple strategy. On one level it's semi-cooperative as players can help each other to make the airship travel further, but at the end of the day only one player can win. It does work with 2 players but it's better with more.

Szó szerint meseszép. A léghajó is álomszerű. No azért nem érezzük játék közben, hogy a felhők felett repülünk, de 6 fővel családi körben nagyon szórakoztató volt. Jókat lehet mulatni, mikor a kapitány nem tud még egyetlen akadályt sem legyőzni, vagy mikor Anyumra kerül a sor mindenki azonnal kiugrik a hajóból :D. Meg hát mikor kapitány vagyok, dzsókert nem vagyok köteles kijátszani... :P Szóval sok vidám pillanatot szül. Egyedül azt rónám fel, hogy nagyon szórnak a pontok a városokban. Nem szedtem ki belőlük, mert 6 játékossal így is volt város, ahol elfogyott, de kevesebb játékosnál lehet kiszedem az 1-1 kiemelkedően értékes kincset. Persze ehhez a játékhoz nem így kell hozzáállni, szóval ha valaki mindenképpen nyerni szeretne, ne üljön le mellé. De ha csak egy kis kikapcsolódásra vágyunk, remek választás!

5-6 játékos esetén mindig előkerül, és tuti siker. Egy partit még sosem játszottunk, mindig elhangzik a: "Na még egyet!". Ez egy jó játék ismérve! 7->8

The first time I tried this game I loved it. And then the love faded slightly away. 

See, I love bluffing games, and this one also has cool artwork and the good-looking ship. So why am I not enthusiastic? 

This game just didn't click enough for me. The climatic moments when the ship travels past the 3rd city are just too few, and many times it feels like I am grinding for points. I really want to like this one, but I am not sure I do.

I purchased this because I thought that my wife and daughter would like it - I was right.

------------

A fun little game that can be over in less than 15 minutes when people know the rules. It can be a little fiddly because you are constantly moving pawns around to keep track of things. I think the fiddliness/complexity ratio is not quite right as you sometimes remove pawns just to put them on again seconds later. The fiddliness is probably the only thing that prevents it from being a 9...so long as you only play 2-3 games at a time. Probably my favourite filler at the moment.

-------------

Edited rating from 8 to 6.5. Non gamers love it, but I find that there is not enough to hold my interest for very long. In the last game I played I happily walked away from my spot so someone could take over from me.

-------------

This has been a hit with the non gamers I have about, but I am often bored while they have fun. Down by .5 because I am just falling out of love with it. BEAUTIFUL game though.

Celestia is either a board game that plays like a party game or a party game that plays like a board game, but whichever way it is, it works for groups of 4 to 6 people.  I have introduced this game to many people, and the reception has been universally positive, even among those who had a bad game.  It is easy to teach although it takes one play through for players to catch on to some of the basic strategic elements of the game.  Thus, it is one of the few games I know of that first timers are likely to say "Let's play again" right after the first game is over.  

My one criticism of the game is the lack of a player aid for the special cards and the unique rules that apply to them.  No one ever remembers these when the game is taught, and inevitably when someone draws one, you see them scrambling for the rulebook to figure out which card they have.  Although I have created my own player aid, this weakness and this alone keeps this game from being rated a 10.

A fairly simple push your luck game where you move a ship forward by paying cards based on a dice roll. Each player gets a turn as captain and rolls the dice, the others get to decide if they want to stay on the ship but the captain must remain. You can jump off (if you are not the captain) to gain points or risk going forward to get more points or crash and get nothing. There are a few of the mechanics which I find frustrating, I feel with some modifications it could have been much better. Just a cute little game of which there are better ones.

A fun and clever push-your-luck game. I like the combination of light social deduction and pushing your luck in the decision of whether to get off the boat or not. The art and components are extremely well done too. The core gameplay is pretty simple and intuitive, except for a few edge cases for special powers and how the captain role works. The only things I don't like are those few rules complexities that make it feel a bit more fiddly than it could be, and the fact that you have to keep adding up your points to see if you've won. Even so, it's an excellent push-your-luck game.

A below-average push your luck game in my opinion. I'd much rather be playing Can't Stop or even Incan Gold. This one has a bit of memory elements (remembering what cards player's don't have) which I don't personally enjoy, and there just seems to be to much other elements for the fairly distilled push your luck gameplay this is going for. Finally as if luck isn't already a central factor, there are a few really nice cards you can draw, or you could just always draw the most common types, meaning winning can hinge upon grabbing some of the powerful cards. Overall I don't see the appeal versus the options listed above.

Interesting push your luck game where you're all in the "boat" together to see if the captain will make it past the round's obstacles. Good and easy to play in a group even with non-gamers. Still some strategy and advantage if you can remember what people had or didn't have. Seems to play better with the high player counts.

19-10-2015. Rated after 1 play. Celestia is a fun Push your luck game. Starting with a Captain player and going clock-wise, the captain rolls dice. THe other plays try to 'judge' if the captain has the cards to match the dice-results. If this is the case, the ship goes to the next location with better loot. otherwise, the players die and start over. If you exit the plane, you get loot and VPs.

Very, very fun push your luck game with very, very pretty graphics. Highly, highly recommended.

Explorers flying airship visit floating islands to pick up treasure. To get to the next island, players roll dice to see what challenges they will face on their journey. To successfully reach the next island, players must have cards that match the challenges displayed on the dice. The further you get, the more points the treasure is worth. Players can choose to get off the ship to collect treasure or stay on to try their luck for higher value treasure. The beginning islands only require two dice, but later islands require three or four dice, increasing the difficulty. If the captain can't match the challenges on the dice with the cards in their hand, whoever is still on the ship crashes and collects no treasure. The ship returns to the first island and players begin again to see how far they can go without crashing. The player who reaches 50 points first wins. Power cards give special abilities to sabotage other players or save yourself. Players take turns being captain. 

Critique: Played with two players total, as well as solo for learning. Bluffing and guessing can be fun. Games with bad luck can be tedious, spending a lot of time crashing at the first few islands until you get more cards in your hand. There are times where you have three or more of only one type of card and none of the others. It might help to add a power card that allows a player to pick up a card of their choice from the discard pile.

A reworking of Cloud 9 by developers who didn't understand the original game and tried to make it "better" by adding all sorts of gamey ideas to it of which all missed the point of the original.

Original game's premise: push your luck game. Kinda like Incan Gold/Diamant - each turn players decide either to continue deeper to more rewards or scram and take what they already have (reached). The twist of Cloud 9 is that one player knows whether the round will be a failure or success (and this player - captain - can't run away), while others have to guess by deduction, memory, logic, hunch or whatever there's available. 

Celestia adds "twists":

1. In original game all colours are evenly spread, now the distribution of cards is uneven. This is somewhat balanced by more joker cards, but... The idea is to make the situation more deductible by logic (odds and that). But... what's wrong with reading people, huh? Developers tried to make this game of odds more about beating the game than the opponents. Shame on them. 
This is the only change from Cloud 9 that can't be removed. 

2. Scoring. In original game each new space is worth more points. And there was a score track (so scores are visible). 
Now there are scoring cards - in each location you can get as much as before. Or MORE. You lucky bastard. Why? Because. Oh and there are some special treasures in first locations that can help you mitigate the whole pushing of luck for one round. 
Yup. Idiotic. If this is a game about pushing your luck and odds and trying to be better at figuring this out than other players, why just dispense of it by giving players point they didn't learn by risk or being more clever than others? 
On top of this - scores are now hidden, but the game ends when somebody reaches 50 points. [facepalm]
You can get rid of this feature, but it will be a bit wonky. Making a PnP score track would be the best option. 

3. Action cards. Oh. My. 
There are cards in the deck that can make you avoid taking risks or make rerolls. Err. Why? Why mess with the push your luck core of the game? 
Okay the original original game (schmidt edition) had some take that - but didn't mess with the odds and variants which were more take that were costly (using normal cards to pay for effects, so it wasn't just "take that as I have a card", but something available to everyone if they wanted to pay the price). 
So instead of letting odds mess with people, here people mess with odds and so another dilution of push your luck core of the game. And psychology and doublethink this brings with itself. 
Developers trying to make the game better by adding gamey stuff with "options" is a hint they might gave been blind to the options already in the game. 
At least you can remove this part with no problem. 

So: if you can get Cloud 9, get it. Or make your own. 
Celestia manages to dilute the tension of pushing your luck (which is the point of push your luck games!).

Note: I would rate Cloud 9 probably around 6.0

Rating down to 1.0 because: My rating of 1.0 means "hope nobody does this again" which in this case means inept game development. Now Cloud 9 is probably a game I'd enjoy, but this decadent gamey lunacy ... oh, dear.

This is Cloud 9's older brother, almost identical in game-play but a little more thematic. This "version" has added some strategy with the implementation of "power cards", which provide a few more options and a small amount of a "screwage" factor. Treasure cards (vs. a scoring track) help keep a player's score relatively secret to the other players too. Game can move a little faster since there are cards that can allow you to reach the higher scoring cities easier than Cloud 9. I prefer Cloud 9 for parties since it's less "intimidating" and more streamlined. But if you want a more embellished experience with a dose of strategy then this might be the alternative for you.

RATING: 7
This is a light race/push your luck game.  In this game players take turns captaining a ship.  They roll dice which will reveal obstacles they then need to play cards to mitigate and get to the next location.  Each other player besides the captain need to decide whether they jump out of the ship and take a score card or stay in the ship with the captain and potentially get higher value score cards.  If the captain cannot mitigate all the obstacles though the ship crashes and everyone in it gets nothing.

I like this game quite a bit.  There are some special cards that offer a little more dynamics to the gameplay.  And there is the opportunity to bluff to get people to jump out early or join you in your demise.  There isn't a lot of artwork but what is here is pretty with soft pastel colors.  The 3D ship you fly around in is neat and eye catching as well.

There is one thing I don't like though and that is with the game being a race to 50 points a player can be in a position where they pretty much have a guaranteed win with nobody else close enough to challenge them and that makes for anticlimactic endings.

In this game the pushing your luck comes from your choice on each move to drop out and get the current (smaller) reward, or risking it all for a potential bigger reward in the future. Great, light fun. And it doesn't take too long. And it has nice artwork.
No, I have nothing to add to this, it's enjoyable.

Are you prepared to adventure in a giant airship to Jules Verne-esque lands and look for wild and exciting treasures the world has not yet seen? Then look no further, this whimsical press-your-luck style game has a lot of charm and is easy for both non-gamers and gamers alike to enjoy. 

Players (passengers) take turn piloting a cute cardboard airship and must roll a set of danger dice to determine what kind of challenges the journey to the next world will face. Passengers must choose to either trust the captain to get them to the next world, or jump ship and go searching for treasure in the current world. The further you voyage, the greater the return, but can you afford to crash and score no treasure cards at all? You be the judge... 

I highly recommend this game. Super cute, very accessible and light.

Celestia is a push your luck game. Everyone is in an airship, with one player designated as captain. The ship has to keep flying to a new land as long as players stay in the airship. There are possibly hazards along the way, which are determined by dice rolls. The captain must play cards to avoid those hazards, provided he's able.

At anytime the players can jump ship and take a card from whatever land they are at. The captain must be the last one to leave the ship however, and must take a final jaunt on his own. From that point on he can decide if wants to continue or not by himself.

So the game becomes a question of when do you jump ship to lock in points, and when do you risk crashing and getting nothing. The lands get progressively better, with the final land giving you 25 points (out of the 50 you need to win). There are some special cards that make it a bit more interesting but that's the general gist of the game.

It's okay. I'm not really a fan of the push-your-luck genre. It's relatively short, so the amount of luck is okay, but I'd probably rather play something else.

Really wanted to try this game, mainly because of its looks. But after two plays with 5 players, I have to say that the gameplay it offers is not interesting enough to keep me interested.

I have literally never had a bad game of Celestia. For a while it was getting played at least twice a week, every week, for several months, and every game was greatly enjoyed by everyone at the table. I still bring it out fairly regularly, and it still always goes down well. 
It's perfect with any crowd of gamer, casual or hardcore. 
If there is one problem with it, is that its hard to find. I've had several people say they tried to get a copy only to be unable to find it in stock anywhere.

Pretty good and fast game, if a little bit form over function. 
Especially the 4 special cards which look rather similar and have only a tiny not very explanatory symbol on them which require quite a lot of rulebook checking . 
Also different levels of prize card are graphically very similar to keep with the pastel pallet where it would be more useful to ACTUALLY see the difference in colours. 

Generally improved alot by some RP to get into the theme. A bBrilliant house rule is the captain of each starting journey names the ship for comedic or adventurous effect. (FFS Flappy Bird goes down well, as does CloudBoaty McCloudBoatFace)

classic push-your-luck game with a new cool theme, up there with diamant/ican gold as the best push-your-luck games

[+] theme, artwork and components; simple mechanic, fast paced, short game, some cards give interesting options

Played this and instantly bought it for my collection. Definitely a perfect choice for party games among your casual or non gamers. It's hilarious dice rolling push your luck game. Of course not my favorite genre but it's nice to have this kind of game.

Good push your luck game. Better than Incan Gold
Incan Gold has the advantage of playing up to eight players, but Celestia has the bigger advantage, for me, of being fun at a lower player count.

A push-your-luck bluffing game where you can't actually bluff. Too dependent on the luck of the card draw for victory points. I prefer the original "Cloud 9", even if the artwork is gorgeous.

Beautiful artwork. If I rated on artwork alone I would give it a 10 - it floats my boat! And to add to that you get a gorgeous 3D flying machine and all in a small box. A push your luck filler.  Simple to play. It is gorgeous.

I do hope we just misunderstood the rules ... but we read them many times and we probably played it correctly. So... where is the game? where is the fun? we could not figure out the meaning of this game. What decisions should i make and based on what, on the fact that the captain says "oh yes, i have good cards!".
I really can't grasp this title and i am quite sure i won't try it again.

Group push-everyone's-luck dice game filler. Everyone hops aboard the 3-D propelled bathtub bound for successively riskier cloud islands bearing successively more interesting treasure.  Take turns as captain. Each round passengers decide whether to stay the course confident the captain has the proper cards to manage the weather dice or bail safely for the treasure at hand.  Add a handful of take that cards.  The beautiful art and imaginative treasure cards are terrific.  This game has been compared to Inca Gold.  Inca Gold plays 8 players smoothly which is great but it is so passive. I prefer the dice and playing from card hands in Celestia--it is more engaging and always evokes great charming moments and shared good natured enjoyment.  Best with six players.

This game is okay.  Not all that different than Incan Gold.  Yes, it is prettier, but it also seems more fiddly.  Moving the pawns around all the time is awkward.

Incan Gold but with more options, hand management, dice rolling, some take that elements, and reading others faces.

I found this game to be very enjoyable. So simple but satisfying.
Very similar to Incan Gold/Diamant but I may prefer this more due to ability cards.
Although the cards adds a luck element that isn't present in Incan gold/Diamant so not sure which I prefer. Both are good.

A 2-6 player push your luck game. Players take turn captaining an airship on a dangerous voyage. Passengers must decide if they think the captain can overcome the obstacles and get to the next city and risk crashing, or get off and collect a treasure from the city they're in.

Very light yet interesting game. Gorgeous as well. I only wish the characters came with special abilities to increase variety. Otherwise a go-to game for the family. Quite short to play but involving everybody at all times, which is a strong plus for me.

Cute.  Plays like a party game in spite of Euro rules.  

The special cards need to be more streamlined, their timing issues cause an inordinate number of trips to the rulebook.

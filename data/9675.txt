Played twice thus far.  The first game fell a little flat for me, but the 2nd got much more interesting after we all realized that this game is all about the blocking other players.  For this reason, it reminds me a lot of Blokus.

You just minmax your resources by calculating how many victory points you get by spending one resource. The thing I found a bit boring was that everyone's got the exactly same number of resources. Thus it boils down to a pure VP/resource optimisation.

However, I found La Strada offering some challenge at least and could play it every now and then.

I picked this from the free shelf at BGG Con 2009. Figured a bad Wallace game was better than most of the dreck being given away. I was right. I actually consider this a good gateway game. Some conflict, but not too much. Terrain costs match AoS. In a weird way, this is a precursor to AoS but newbie-friendly.

RATING: 7
{1 play, 3 player} Like it for now.  Not sure that'll hold, especially after a 4-player game, but I was really taken with the simplicity and elegance of it.  Yeah, the graphics could be better, and though I didn't see it happen in our game, I can see how the start player could dominate... which would be too bad if that turns out to be true and unfixable because this is otherwise a nice, solid, little game.

9/23/07 - One Play - Interesting game with some tough choices.  It started out quickly with all four players just connecting to whichever city was closest.  It soon became apparent that we had all missed the key strategy and choices began to take a longer and the intensity heightened.   A good connection game with a nice level of screw factor.   Sometimes the cheapest route isn't the best, especially when you're trying to protect your lone cubes.   I look forward to further playings.   Quick and a nice level of strategy.

Another of the few times that Martin Wallace's evil twin has allowed good Martin to escape the cellar and release a gem of a game, free from silly luck-monkey dice and hopelessly fiddly rules.

At no more than 20 minutes play time the game is explained in 5 mins and you have a lovely little strategic filler. 

Second play with 2 players. The 2 player varient rules at the back of the rule book just plain don't work. The first player has such a huge advantage.

Quite engaging and most games are close, but in four player the first player seems to always finish a point or two clear. Maybe with more plays the group could autocorrect this advantage but it is quite difficult to completely block in a player without wrecking your own score.

Rating is solely for 2-player game which seems to be a lopsided race; with the person who builds roads first having the advantage. The 2nd player needs to block, but blocking isn't always easy. Maybe the solution is to take turns as start player and average the score of 2 games. Must say that the random city distribution in our game put almost all the highest point cities close together.

Two 2-player games. We played the variant where each player takes two colors and their final score is the lower of the two. This was a fun game! Took right at 30 minutes. Turns are quick, downtime minimal. A bit brain burny. Need to balance helping yourself while trying to block in the other player(s). Looking forward to more plays.

Interesting little tile laying, rails-lite type game. The action point mechanism and the desire to capture things for yourself makes the game tense and exciting. Not Wallace's best game ever, but a quality offering nonetheless.

RATING: 6
There's nothing novel here but it's actually not a bad game, far better than you'd think from the low BGG ranking. The game only takes 10-15 minutes, it's easy to teach, has a neat scoring mechanism, and isn't nearly so economically constraining as Wallace's other route-building games. I don't like the two-player rules which only allow one cube per city: it completely changes the game to be exclusively about roads as opposed to the more nuanced scoring when you allow multiple cubes per city. Nevertheless it's still a fun, gateway-level Martin Wallace "train game" (without the trains).

RATING: 5
Not sure on this one. On the one hand, I kinda like it, it's short, it's neat, it's got interesting decisions, and the price is more or less in line with the substance of the game (although a few bucks cheaper wouldn't hurt). But I do wonder what, exactly, the game's niche is. It has an awkward sense of being too long for short filler, but not substantial enough for a "bigger" game. So a conflicted rating. I do like it, but I'm not sure I like it enough, given the game's proportions.

A brutal game of Route Building. Kind of like the Anti-TransAmerica. Only played with three, but even at three you are constantly cutting each other off and making life difficult for each other, even if you don't want to. It is simply a side effect of trying to get points. I can't imagine how brutal this game would be with four.

RATING: 4
1 play (3p). From one angle I see this as a nice quick RR connection type game with fast action point type play. From another angle, I read about the turn order advantage problem, and then in my one play, the first player came in first, the second player came in second, etc. Maybe I'm overly alert to it, and I only played it once. Third angle, I'm not too engaged by the competitive mini-maxing of the game, like many other RR games which also don't engage me. But I think a lot of other people do enjoy that; with its easy flow, this could be your cup of tea. Played after eating la strata.

I'm a fan of Martin Wallace after the incredible Princes of the Renaissance and Age of Steam. This game is much lighter but plays extremely well for what it is. In fact my friend joked he bought it because he wondered if Martin could make a quick game. This game will not dissapoint you. It has room for good Tactics and some general strategy. Its quick, clean, fun, easy to learn and rewarding. I'm not a fan of lighter games so my rating of 8 is very high for that type of game. If you like that type of game consider it a 10.

(Played only 2-player games.) The first game I played was with the official 2 player-variant, which doesn't work at all, and relegates this game to the levels of 'mediocre' at best. You would do well to avoid it at all costs, and send a letter of complaint to the publisher for printing misleasing information on the box. However, with the 'Danger'-variant—available from this site—the game becomes a relatively fast but intense brain burner, if fairly dry and abstract. Initial warehouse placement seems absolutely critical, and if you make an error early in the game, it is likely going to cost you the victory. I also find the colour scheme too bland. Eventually, I sold off the game, as I deemed other games more interesting to put in front of others rather than this one.

[b]Update[/b] I have a habit of revisiting old titles from time to time, to see if there was anything I missed. I had the opportunity to try out La Strada again, many years after I sold it, and play it with 4 this time. Then La Strada is a relatively quiet little game in the spirit of Through the Desert and its brethren: create connections while at the same time attempt to prevent others from doing the same. A little twist is offered because of the majority aspect of settlements reached: valuable points can be diluted this way. The game works at 4, and works fairly well, but I think in the end it remains a little bland. There isn't much wrong with it apart from the rather bland artwork which makes keeping track of what's going on a bit of a puzzle... but at the same time the game doesn't really attempt to do anything more beyond the restrictions imposed by the road building. I suppose that if you are a fan of Martin Wallace you need to own this game; but that's where today, in 2013, the buck more or less stops. I'm glad to have been able to try the game anew, but I won't need to play it again. The rate for the game represents the game at 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is one of Martin Wallace's more simple designs. I prefer a bit more complexity in a game. Having said that, is does take only 30 to play and can work quite well as a filler.

REVISED COMMENT: The second time I played La Strada I found it much more enjoyable than the first. I suspect I may have simply had too high an expectation of the game. It is quick and it is fun.

RATING: 6
Initially, this game was a hit because it went over well with the missus.  Looking back, that was entirely because what you do on a turn is quick and simple, not because the game itself is especially interesting.  Still it is an easy game to learn with simple decisions, yet some depth.  Is terrible with two-players, though. 2009-05: donated game to Diabetes Fundraiser

RATING: 5
Not much fun in this one,  I thought.  I particularly dislike the fact that playing well seems to require somewhat vicious tactics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Think of La Strada as the next level up from Blokus.  Once again you have players trying to lay out routes in a way that maximizes their chances for future routes, simultaneously trying to block their opponents' progress.

But the added layer is that the settlements you are building towards have different values, and they also each change based on the number of connections made.  The most valuable tend to be those with the least connections.

Setting aside the pasted-on theme, this is a clever little puzzle game that I enjoyed.  Definitely looking forward to trying it with 3 or 4 players.  NOTE - avoid the official 2-player variant from the rulebook.  Instead just have each player use 2 colors in alternating turns.  Much simpler and it works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
We set up the game and I didn't think I'd like it, it looked uninteresting.  The first game clearly proved me wrong and I lost cluelessly.  The second game had a completely different texture, I made a host of different mistakes and lost very badly.  I'd like to play again, if only so that I can make yet more different mistakes.

RATING: 8
Components: Attractive, sturdy hex tiles, though with some troubling coloration, and the towns could be easier to distinguish. But overall a great looking game.

Experience: Quick, simple connection game with interesting choices about the direction to build, and which cities to occupy. A great scoring mechanism. Best with the full four players. Things get tense as the board quickly fills up and choices are limited.

This is a tough one.  I really liked it when I played it with three players.  I played it twice with four players and the turn order reflected exactly how players finished - the first player was first, the second player second, etc.  Don't even bother with the two player game.  I actually think there is a very nice game in here - with a bit more development it could have been great.

A really cool little tile laying game.  But it is one of those games where the opening placement is 60% of the game.  So the fact that the same player gets to place his city first and then place the first road is a pretty big advantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players are attempting to building roads across a hex-board to connect up to cities, ideally denying the other players connections.  Builds are achieved by banking 6 build points per turn, then spending the points to build roads across plains (2), woods (3) or hills (4).  There are four different sized cities, all earning different points.  The catch is the more players connect to any one city, the more the points won are diluted.  Very good, sometimes nasty, connection game.  Plays in about 20 minutes.

Interesting connection game. I think of it as "Blokus with a theme." There is a problem with the starting player has a HUGE advantage, but it's short enough to play multiple times and give everyone a shot at being first. (I think the box says 30 min, but I taught someone how to play and we played two three-player games all in under 30 minutes) Says it plays 2-4 but the two-player game is terrible. Traded it.

See my review for more details.

GATEWAY - Transamerica 'hearty'.  Or rather, Transamerica is La Strada 'light'.  Very simple.  Not much to it.  Sometimes that's what I'm in the mood for, though.  Needs a good varient involving more resources per tern and different setup and play order, so you have more blocking options and the last player doesn't get screwed.
 
Note:  Didn't really enjoy the 2 player varient.

Very interesting game. Very very quick, nice simple mechanism, intriging game. Played with 4 players, I'd like to try this with 3 and 2. We felt the opening placing of your workshop was crucial, and that the 4th player therefore was at a disdvantage, but he still came second (the starting player won). Very interesting and I recommend you play this. It felt very much like Durch die Wuste to me.

RATING: 4
Played 5+ times. First two plays with 3 players was VERY fun. I had serious misgivings about this title based on the problems I'd heard with it, but this has been one of the most pleasant surprises. A 20 minute game hinging on action points, road networks, and blocking people. This, to me, is a better version of Ticket To Ride. My only complaint is how muddy the colors get. The player colors should have been much brighter to make it easier to see what is going on. Problem is that the outcome always seems a bit random in the sense that it's impossible to determine what other players will do and what options they will leave you open, and vice versa. This factor knocks it down from 9 to 8.

The play is mechanical, predictable and even with enough time, analysis-paralysis could not set in as choices are self-evident.  Will try with 3 or 4 but I fail to see how more players could raise my level of enthousiasm.  A disappointment as it fails to try something new, and the familiar seems dry.

The first time I played this my impression was: "That's it?!?!"  Subsequent plays confirmed that yes indeed: "that" was "it".  From the very beginning I found myself thinking up improvements to the existing rules.  This game is like playing Age of Steam stripped down to only the track laying.  For its price and the number and quality of its components, it really should be more of a game.  If it where Age of Steam with both track laying AND shipping it would be better... but I lacked the motivation to write the rules to make it such.  Perhaps when someone does, it will become a game worth owning.  For now, it's too much price for too little game.  Way overproduced for what it is.

I didn't care for this much the first time through, but the second play was much better.  The board play is too open with three players, but feels appropriately tight with four.  My chief complaint is that there are a lot of pieces to set up and sort for such a quick filler game.  It seems rather obvious to me that the first player has a big advantage over the fourth player. I recommend staggering the starting resources as in games like Attika and Through the Desert. Maybe give 4, 5, 6, and 7 first-turn build points to the players, or something similar.

[Initial Impression: 7]
La Strada boils route-building down to its core.  Using a very simple and straight-forward rule set, it creates a very congested and competitive contest, even with 3 players.  Because players share a diminishing score in each settlement (scores decrease for each additional player who connects to that settlement), there is a huge incentive to move into others' territories. However, the game is won or lost on your ability to block other players out of your larger settlements, while trying to make sure that they can't cordon off their own monopolies. Yet there is a lot of tension in that you must juggle these two goals. The fact that the congested board means that you can't possibly build into every settlement makes for interesting semi-cooperative play - each player relies on other players to prevent monopolies for others, while still trying to set up their own monopolies.

Most of the game's decisions seemed pretty obvious. Unless I've played this wrong, being the first player seems like a big advantage: Going later in the turn is only useful if the other players made big setup mistakes.

I'd play again, but I don't think I'd request it.

A nice, straightforward filler.  The only problem is the rules don't specify regarding placing your workshop directly adjacent to a settlement.  They are NOT connected unless via road, similar to fresh fish!

RATING: 8
A light, easy to learn, easy to teach, fun game that plays in under 20-30 minutes, with a Martin Wallace pedigree. Wallace's pick-up-and-deliver mechanism from his Railroad Tycoon/Age of Steam is distilled to the barest essentials of network building.

You get six action points per turn that are converted into road building on the map board. Two points to build in the plains, three in woods, and four in the hills. Action points can be banked up to ten for the next turn. There are four kinds of nodes on the map, where connecting to them gives a linearly increasing amount of gold (VP) at the end of the game. However, if other players connect to the node, each player gets linearly decreasing amounts of gold. The cities give five gold, if you're the only one. If another player connects, it drops to four gold each, and so forth. The node values scale to the quiet hamlet with two gold. Whoever collects the most gold wins.

Players start from a home station that they place on the variable map board, and then it is a race to connect as many high value nodes, while simultaneously blocking others from sharing your connected nodes. 

The map is comprised of six sections that can be rearranged, such that terrain and locations of the nodes are different for each game. At each node, the type and value of the node will be randomly determined each game. Thus, there is tremendous replay value.

A 3-player game clocked in at 15 minutes, such that we played the game three times. There is great fun in racing and blocking each other, which is the core of competitive network building. There was some concern that the starting player may have more than a slight advantage, but this was dispelled when the start player was soundly defeated. Still, it may be worth checking out the forums for the "fix" regarding this issue, if it is one.

The components were all high quality, with simple, easy to learn rules (4 pages). Very little downtime. This is essentially an abstract, along the lines of "Hey, That's My Fish!" kind of gameplay, with plenty of depth if one is willing to dig deeper, or quick boisterous, mindless fun if not. There is something for everyone here, and this makes for a very accessible gateway game for non-gamers, at the same level of complexity as Trans America. I rate is a solid "8".

Update (01/30/2014) 10 plays: The common criticism of this game is the "first-player bias", where the first player has a significant advantage over the other players. Since they select first the location of their workshop, they have first access to the high VP cities. The last player has to contend with leftovers, and if they are careless, they may quickly be blocked out of a large portion of the board. There is talk about giving the latter players extra action points to compensate. We will have to think about this.

Network building game, with a random (kind of Catan-esque) board set up.  The aim of the game is to connect your starting tile to the other settlement tiles on the map with your roads.  The price of building a road depends on the terrain it's going onto, and each player receives a set amount of resources every turn, with unused ones being rolled over to the next turn (to a limit).  The reward for connection to a settlement diminishes depending on the number of other players that also got to that settlement.

I didn't dislike this game, but I feel like I would get bored of it extremely quickly as it seems to have pretty limited depth.  The scope for strategy is small, as every player always receives the same resources every turn no matter what, this means that there is no risk/reward for adopting a certain tactic.  The main strategic input is from being able to block your opponents with your roads but this isn't much fun.

Not a terrible game at all, but not one that I think I would enjoy playing very often.

Disappointing & Terrorific!!! Players are attempting to building roads across a hex-board to connect up to cities, ideally denying the other players connections. Builds are achieved by banking 6 build points per turn, then spending the points to build roads across plains (2), woods (3) or hills (4). There are four different sized cities, all earning different points. The catch is the more players connect to any one city, the more the points won are diluted. Very bad, sometimes nasty, connection game. Plays in about 20 minutes.

Road-building game. Points are awarded for connection to a variety of settlements. Rating based on the two-player game only. Not a bad game as such, but on the other hand not terribly exciting either. The basic La Strada rules have to be stretched quite a bit to accomodate two players, and my feeling is that the game loses too much of its feel in that process. I suspect I would like the game better with more than two players (a '6', perhaps?), but it will never be a favorite.

I enjoy this road-builder. It's like a simplified train game which is all about laying track and not worried about the economics of keeping a company afloat. Lots of discussion on this site about a turn order problem, but I'm not 100% convinced. And if I do come around to that conclusion I think there are some easy fixes (1. Place workshops in reverse turn order. 2. Increase starting build points for players in later turn order.) Ultimately it is a game about choosing between maximizing your position versus blocking and minimizing opponents. I can't really tell if there is more "meat" here than initially meets the eye.

Streamlined route/network building game with an emphasis on having a presence in as many large scoring areas as possible while not letting anyone monopolies too many locations.

Interesting tactical game with a thin roadbuilding theme.  It offers a series of quick puzzles in which one tries to maximize one's options per turn and (as much as it's possible)leave oneself well set-up for subsequent turns.

I wanted soooo much to make this one work.  Great production (except for the unclear artwork on the city/town tiles).  We couldn't seem to shake the player-order advantages/disadvantages.  In my more ambitious times I actually custom-painted some components in the hope of creating a fix for this game.

My least favorite Martin Wallace to date... still, even then, I still rate it above a 6.

Sold my copy at Unity Games XV convention.

A quick little game that lacks any real depth or strategy. There are decisions in this game, but they are mostly obvious.  There is a turn order advantage that should have been balanced out.  Because all of the scoring is at the end, there is no real way to track progress.  It sacrifices depth to be quick, making for a below average game.

RATING: 6.25
One play so far which I enjoyed. I won because I simply connected the most with the cheapest routes in between. One player was fending off others out of his territory, but that cost him too much roads. That strategy wasn't rewarded by the game. Also I was second in turn order, so the third player after me had one turn less, when I placed my last cube. All in all a mixed feeling: the game should have more cubes for each player, that shouldn't be the limiting factor I believe. Play on until you cannot connect anything anymore. The game should grant each player the same amount of turns as well I believe. But it was fun playing and we can easily adjust our rules for these too omissions: take cubes from say E&T and let people have an extra turn until the starting players' turn comes up again. But so far for a first impression. It is light but OK game. Second play: still not thrilled, starting player has big advantage.

RATING: 7.5
A connect-the-dots style of strategy game where players must build routes between different towns to get victory points.  Points are generated by the size of towns players connect to, but towns generate fewer points for each additional person who connects to them.  Thus, this game is a tactical game of attempting to connect to the most cities while blocking (or distracting) your opponents from connecting to them.  A fun, relatively short game that's not as simple as it looks.  I'm up for more games of it.

Terrible. It felt about as complicated as Tic-Tac-Toe. Place tiles on the board in obvious locations. Score points. Someone wins by a few or maybe just a couple. For simple "route building," Through the Desert is just as easy to explain and is considerably deeper. No need to ever play this again.

I was excited about La Strada when I first heard of and played it, but since then that enthusiasm has been waning. It seemed like it would be a simple route-building game attached to a simple market competition mechanism. Plus, a modular board and variable set-up!

But sadly, I think there just isn't much to this game besides connecting to as many cities as you can, as fast as you can. With people who know what they're doing, initial placement is the clincher, not the specifics of how you build your routes. Often, the person who can place all their cubes first will win. And often, that is the first player. I've tried what seemed like tactically feasible moves, but anything that takes extra building points prevents you from connecting to more cities faster, so it just isn't worth it.

Maybe I'm missing something important, but I traded this away.

Very interesting pure strategy route-building game that combines "surround" elements with route-building elements.

Personally I think this game is underrated.

Based on only 2 playings, but I would say this game does not work with 2 players as depending on the intitial layout in one of our games there was no was to beat the first player...we analyzed it every way and no way to avoid early lead/victory from initial positioning and turn order....too bad.....better with more players I would guess.

Road building game in 16th century Italy to get one's market cubes in 4 different types of cities. Scoring is unique in that the more players there are in a city, the less points one gets.

But then at the end I was left with a little bit of a "Oh, that's it?" feeling.

German Kosmos edition.  An engaging little game that is unfortunately done in by the fact that the 2-player game is horribly broken out of the box.  Add to that the fact that the board gets too crowded too quickly with four, and you have a very limited-niche game: it's great with three but not worth it with any other number.  That, sadly, means it won't get played much.  Tried the Danger 2p variant - it's balanced, but it doesn't feel 'fun' enough.  Too bad.

Based on one play: This is like a very light version of a game like Steam. You build roads trying to connect locations and once connected you can place a cube on it. The goal is to have the most cubes on the board but also to have them with a few opponents on them with you, so you simply try to block others. Once a road is placed it cannot be moved and blocks everyone else. Simply but works all and a nice into to more complex games.

1. This game should not be compared with Magna Gracia. There are a few surface similarities but the games are completely different and intended for different audiences. This is a lite game that is similar in complexity to TransAmerica and should appeal to the same group. That said, there is slightly more meat here than in TransAmerica.

2. The two player game simply doesn't work. (As written in the rules.)

3. The 'first player always wins' will only occur in games where the first player is a thinking human being and his opponents are tomatos.

4. The game is short and offers an alternative to TransAmerica or many other fillers.

Very fast game with the initial workshop placement of critical importance. It's a race to the highest value settlements using the lowest number of resources while attempting to cut off your opponent. If it were only a 2 player game the rating would be a 6 but otherwise a strong 7.

I don't accept the 'first player lock' on the game. That assumes that there is ONE dominant starting position, and that the 1st player will see it, and that the other players won't interfere. Not likely unless the 1st player is actually so much better than the opposition that the win was assured even if in the last starting position.

Wasn't expecting much, so found it a very pleasant surprise. Not super thinky but has enough strategy to be interesting. Seems like it would appeal to Catan players whose favorite part is trying to build the longest road.

The first player advantage is an issue, but I've tried having player turn order be the reverse of the workshop placement order, and that seems to balance things a little better.

Played with four; haven't tried it with two, and I'm concerned it wouldn't work so well.

Definitely NOT a 2 player game, and that's the only chance I've had to play so far.  It was so bad as a 2 player game that I have not tried to pull it out again yet. (Jan 1, 2008)

The two player game put me off quite a bit.  So it took over a year to pull it out again (Jan 30, 2009).  Played twice last night and it's a much better game with 3, although going last still leaves you at a distinct disadvantage.  Much more fun though and plays quickly.  I bet it will come out much more often now!

Needs three or four players to cramp things up a bit. Quick and simple. Game ends with a bit of a fizzle rather than a bang. Experience teaches you to play very aggressively.

Some players complain that it's a mean spirited game, but no more so than Magna Grecia or Age of Steam in my opinion.

Picked up in Santa Fe.

This game could use an art overhaul. Mike Doyle, ya busy? It plays quick but it's a bit fiddly which increases set up time. Players are establishing a trade network among settlements, for which points at the end of the game are awarded. Competition in any given settlement results in a reduction or even elimination of points. While this seems like an interesting scoring mechanism, I bought this game expecting I could play two players, and the two-player rules completely nerf the scoring rules. It's a far-less interesting game for two than three or four.

There is the agonizing decision between spreading more of your cubes onto the board, or defending some of your more profitable holdings. The turn order is broken, but a simple house rule should fix it.

La Strada -- Heard it doesn't work well for two players, but I enjoyed it that way.  Look forward to more players.

RATING: 6
La Strada seems like half a game to me. It is not bad. The game is a track building game like most railroad games, but that's it. Just the track. I kept hoping to see the pick-up and delivery.

In this sense, it is like TransAmerica. I would say that it is better than TA, but still not exactly filling.

RATING: 7
Connection. The lightest Martin Wallace game around, it almost feels *too* simple compared to his other stuff. That said, it actually plays well, has a strong tactical aspect (like any connection game), scores easily at the end, and I think would actually make a pretty good gateway game, weighing in at about 30 minutes per play. Glad I finally got a copy.

RATING: 7.5
A great light tactical game.  Everything that Moreisi wanted to be withought the clutter and confusion.  

As usual in a Martin Wallace game lots of tough decisions  with only so many thing that you can do.  Strangely passive aggressive as the game relies on indirect conflict.  Build roads to put yourself in position to score, but use your roads to block out others.  This takes Twixt to the next level.  Whith three players this gets an 8, with four a 7.  

I'm confused as to why people don't like this game. I'm guessing that people aren't expecting a meaty little filler and as a result they are let down because they want a big box Wallace game.  Don't believe the 1st player always wins talk either I just don't find it to be the case..

RATING: 6
This might be a touch high, but it is a really pretty game, easy to play, and has hexes.  (If you can't tell, I'm a sucker for hexes.)  I really like trying to figure out how I'm going to connect to the next destination.  As an added bonus, I think this would be a fun two-player with my wife.

UPDATE: Still leaving it this high, since it's delightfully fast and strategic, even if it is a bit of a group hug in general.

UPDATE #2: This is bland and uninteresting as a two-player, but still is quite fun with three or four.

UPDATE #3: Continues over time to show its age and simplicity. Nice to show novice gamers, but initial turn order often sets the stage for who is going to win and the scores are often quite close. On the plus side, it does play quickly.

RATING: 7.5
A very cool little road-building game, in the vein of railroad games but simpler and lighter.  Nicely produced (although a few commentators have highlighted minor colour and distinguishability issues with some of the components), and it is genuinely playable in 30 minutes or so.  But deeper in strategy and interest than the average 'filler' game.  For 2-4 players (although some gamers have expressed reservations about the official 2-player rules).  Easy to learn and play, with only 4 pages of well explained and illustrated rules (but there are still a couple of rule interpretation debates in the posts on BGG).  There is possibly a first-player turn advantage question around the game, but if you are concerned about this, a number of BGGers have made different suggestions to try.  My wife and I both really enjoy this game - especially for something that plays in around 30 minutes.  Recommended.

have to play by giving players different resources based on turn order - 4, 5, 6, 7 - because going earlier is a significant advantage. Still, a very fast, interesting connection game.

A connection game where it is surprisingly difficult to distinguish the different settlements.  It's almost unbelievable how similar they look.  Besides that obvious issue, it's short in duration and has a limited appeal to those who enjoy this type of game.

Light game of planning routes and claiming lucrative spots. One of those rare Wallace games that just seem to work without imbalances (development by Kosmos I presume). But in the process of refining, most of the tension somehow got lost. Decent enough to play with casual players, just a bit too little 'bite' to please gamers in the long run.

Solid 2-player game, AP sufferers need not apply!

This game plays very well with 3!  The 3rd player completely removes the AP problems with optimizing in the 2 player game.  It plays very fast and is absolutely loaded with painful decisions.

The only caveat, is that, like most Wallace games, they don't balance experienced vs. inexperienced players well at all.  The complete lack of luck means the inexperienced player will be trounced!

Have played enough to know that the game is not balanced.  player should finish in about the same order as the play.  I.e. player One should win, Player 2 should get second, etc...

Also the game is simply broken when played as a two player game. There is no way for a competent player to lose if they have the initiative.

RATING: 6
Looks very cool and I love the connection mechanic.  *** UPDATE *** I've been waiting to play this for so long and it is great, but it seems obvious that the first player has an advantage and there is NOTHING in the rules to mitigate this advantage.  I've read here that there are some variants that I might like to try and that with superior play the other players bash on player one more to compensate for the advantage.  Bashing on the leader is not a good way to compensate for first player advantage in my book.  I'm sad to say I probably won't pick this up to try out the variants.

RATING: 6
I really like this game.  It is quick in the times I have played it I have not seen the first player have a big advantage as some have said.  I hope to give it more plays with a different group and maybe then I will update my comments but I doubt my rating will go down.  I really like the choices in this game but again others have said there are no choices.  Oh, well I guess it is impossible to make a game that make everyone happy.

Pretty good little filler where you spend resource points to lay roads (strada) between hamlets, towns, villages and cities. You are awarded points for being present in the various locations but are awarded more points the fewer numbers of players share the spot with you. Each turn you must connect to a location or the game ends. You essentially try to restrict access to the various locations so you can keep all the points for yourself. Enjoyed it and would play again.

Played this and Magna Grecia in the same night and I would rather play that. The reason I'm comparing the two is that they both involve connecting cities with roads that can't be crossed by other players. There are more things to do in Magna Grecia that La Strada doesn't offer, but La Strada has that overloading a town rule that seems neat. But, we played La Strada with three players so we didn't really see any locations overloaded. 

Not bad if it's kept as a filler, but once someone starts to think too much about their turn it's a long filler.

Very tense game in terms of competition among players to establish critical connections first. Pretty streamlined design, as well. Still, there's a lack of anything truly exciting here, and this one doesn't seem to hit the table often. The graphics also all sort of blend in together, making it difficult for players to distinguish things like workshops and cities apart easily. The game is good, but not outstanding, and probably not quite good enough to continue occupying space on my very crowded game shelves.

I would NOT recommend this as a 2-player game. In a 2-player game, the first player has an overwhelmingly strong advantage. For 3 or more the game is much more interesting and balanced. Still plays fast.

La Strada is fantastic filler that distills my favorite mechanism from hex-based train games:  the cutoff.  The entire game is based on cutting off your opponents.  Almost no other mechanics get in the way.  La Strada is brisk, surprising, and very easy to teach.  The final scoring feels random, but really just stays out of the way of good gameplay.

RATING: 7.5
I like it. Short, luckless, randomized modular board, not tons of options, and the tempting thought that maybe you could figure out how to solve it, simultaneous with the realization that you really couldn't.

You're just expanding a road network from a starting point, hoping to monopolize as much of the map as possible. Track has to connect to city nodes, and you score more points the fewer other players hook up to the same cities. Building constraints come in the form of varying terrain costs and inflexibility of the road tiles (they can only go straight or turn gently; no sharp turns, forking, or intersections).

...Main gripes would be that the art design makes the board state hard to read, and that scores seem to be close. I think perhaps there isn't enough room to be clever, or it isn't easy enough to block people meaningfully.

I enjoy the decision process for each turn even though first player to place roads seems pretty secure in grabbing the win.  It helps that you can never tell who is in the lead until you count the final score.

As a 2 player we did not like it - one took one end and the other took the rest. As a 4 player it worked much better. I think it may be best with 3. More plays may mean I will rate this higher.  The board is lovely - I really like the 4 interlocking pieces and hence the smaller box.

GAME: Lost Legacy: Second Chronicle – Vorpal Sword & Whitegold Spire
RANK: 2356
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Vorpal Sword is the best version of Lost Legacy. We also enjoy playing the Megamix variant Vorpal Sword + Flying Garden with the Vorpal Sword as the lost legacy.

RATING: 7
The Vorpal Sword is great, and definitely follows the feel of the other sets. The Whitegold Spire, though, feels like a trick taking game masquerading as Lost Legacy.

Vorpal Sword is good. Whitegold Spire is a little odd in that it creates a point system that doesn't mix as nicely with others.

This edition of Lost Legacy comes down a bit because one of these versions ( The Whitegold Spire) includes scoring points for certain cards and winning that way instead of finding the Lost Legacy. We can understand the designer wanting to step up the game play but we prefer the simplicity of just finding the Legacy.

RATING: 7
Vorpal Sword - 8, It's the most aggressive deck of all the released sets so far, and probably the best legacy as well. Overall I think this is the funnest set, it also mixes well with other decks.
White Gold Spire - 6, The gimmick for white gold spire it that it's about points rather than just finding the legacy and I actually like the idea since it's cool to have different themes going in each deck, unfortunately this limits it's ability to mix with other decks. On its own it's okay but not as fun as the rest. It does have the best art of all the sets though!

==2017/11/06==
The two decks in Second Chronicle do NOT combine well to play a 6 player game.  The points mechanic of Whitegold Spire can't blend into anything else coherently.

I usually play Vorpal Sword when I play Lost Legacy.  I only bring out Whitegold Spire when I want variety but want to keep playing Lost Legacy instead of something else (or when I want to run two tables of Lost Legacy).

==2018/01/30==
I don't play this any more.  It's not a good 2-player game, and the gatherings I'm at usually have more than 4 people.  Maybe it's just never the right situation for it.  Maybe the game (even Vorpal Sword) isn't actually very much fun?

RATING: 7.2
With this double-deck release, we finally have a lot of options for Lost Legacy, whether we play a big mega deck or carefully balance them out. Glad to see AEG reverted to the Japanese release format, the art continues to be an improvement over the original, and the new mechanics are added at just the right pace.

   Vorpal Sword:  Contrary to what you'd expect by its name, this expansion is surprisingly peaceful.  Expect a good number of cards in the ruins.  8/10

   Whitegold Spire:  Re-defines the essential mechanics of Lost Legacy, introducing a points-based system to determine victory.  There is no player elimination, and with the inclusion of the Taxes card, the duration of this expansion is all too excessive.  6/10

I really like this game. It's basically my go-to filler if I want to play a fast multi-hand game. I only play the Vorpal Sword deck, which was recommended as being most like Love Letter but slightly improved. After playing Love Letter, I definitely agree. I actually gave Love Letter away, since I like this game much more and don't feel like I need both in my collection. I like the game best when we make it to end scoring rather than an elimination win. That seems to happen maybe 20% of the time. I don't think the game is good with 2 players because elimination victories are much more likely.

Vorpal Sword: This set feels even more Love Letter-esque than usual, with many of the card actions closely resembling those from the original set. That's not a bad thing, however, although I still slightly prefer the simple elegance of Love Letter.

Vorpal Sword is a solid setup with a few ways to win. Elimination or special 2 card

The Whitegold is the worst one I've played as it's all based on the value of the cards in your discard. Could be interesting with deck building but the base setup is boring with no ruins.

I´m tired of Love Letter, in my game group we are replacing it with the Lost Legacy series, which I like a bit more. From this set, I have only played with the Whitegold Spire cards and it was boring for us. The problem, I think, is that there is no player elimination, instead you need to score points. I feel the game loses a lot removing the player elimination, no one at the table had much fun playing it. Perhaps if you mix these cards with other sets it will be better.

Bottom line, a boring set. I still have high hopes for the Vorpal Blade set and I will comment when we play with it.

Nowadays, I’m very tired of most (if not all) micro games. The proliferation of Love Letters all over the place doesn’t help my opinion of the games. My desire to play any of them  is very low now, so I’m rating it accordingly. I already sold all my Lost Legacy sets and I’m very happy about that. If I’m going to play boardgames, I prefer meatier games. 

When I Play micro games I feel I’m wasting my precious gaming time. All the games in the Lost Legacy series of games are way too long for what the game offers.

Much better than its counterpart (Whitegold Spire). In this case I like that the game has player elimination. I had fun playing it but every time I play it, I like it less and less. The campaign mode is VERY long for what the game offers. We usually play 4 rounds and that’s it.

The art is quite good.

I feel the Lost Legacy series of games is superior to Love Letter (except for the Whitegold Spire Set). I like the Ruins and the investigation phase, however I almost never want to play any of them.

Bottom line, The Vorpal Sword set is ok, still it is most of the same. I’m getting tired of these microgames. The only reason I have not sold them is that I want to mix the sets and see what happens.

One of the Lost Legacy series! I think this is Love Letter for people that want to play the game more and the player less. There are certain types of people that just don't "get" Love Letter, and that's the group I'll play this with. Or with larger and less experienced groups. Love Letter shines at 2-4 that know what they're doing, but Lost Legacy is great for everyone!

Vorpal Sword Deck:
I have to say that I like the Starship deck better than this one, this has some pretty cool cards but the interaction between all the cards makes it a bit easier to know where the Vorpal Sword is because there are a lot of cards that allow you to look at other player cards, at the ruins, at the top of the deck... it also as a lot less shuffling of the Ruins so it makes it a lot easier to keep track of what you know about the ruins.
Not saying that it's a bad deck, it isn't but I prefer the Starship deck.

I like the additions here, but this should have probably been called Lost Legacy 2, because they changed the rules just enough to where the game feels slightly different. Basically instead of being the one to find the Lost Legacy, you win by having the most points equal to the numbers on the cards you play. I actually didn't mind this as much as I thought I would, though I'm a little bummed that the Whitegold Spire cards don't integrate as well with other sets as a result. There are some really neat cards in here, but I think I would have been just as happy without these additions.

The Vorpal sword is another very nice Lost Legacy set, different enough from the others but still the same great game. In fact, it's among my favourite of the 8 sets so far releasedt.

The Whitegold Spire though is a very strange beast, partially replacing the pure deduction of the other sets with a VP-based mechanic (albeit one in which the deduction plays a large role). I find it less interesting than the other sets, but it's a decent enough game all the same.

Two new card sets for Lost Legacy.  I'm really liking this idea of being able to combine and replace cards from different sets for really varied games.  It still lacks the simplicity, elegance, and charm of Love Letter but this is starting to shape up to be a really intriguing game with a decent amount of variability.

The one new addition in this set is that you can play with scoring rules instead of winning via finding the lost legacy/player elimination.  It doesn't really change up the formula much but at least they provided a variant for more gameplay variety.

Whitegold Spire is garbage, but Vorpal Sword is great, even better than Love Letter. It has better balance and much more interesting choices, in exchange for just a little extra complexity. Of the Lost Legacy sets I've played, I like this one best, by far. None of the cards are overly complicated, and many of them involve gaining information or hiding cards in the ruins, which works well with the legacy mechanic. I might even like this better than Coup.

If you want a microgame that's gamier than love letter i'd suggest Cypher, or Braverats for two players. This is just not different enough from Love Letter.
Whitegold Spire is different enough, because it doesn't have player elimination. But Cypher is still better.

RATING: 6
If you know Love Letter (by the same designer), you will quickly understand how to play this slightly more complex version of the game. The principles remain similar: there are a number of card types, some cards exist several times. Players always have a single card in their hand. During their turn they draw a second card and decide which one to keep and which to play. Then the played card effect is executed which may allow you to look at an opponents card, exchange your card with, guess which card an opponent has etc.
 

As in Love Letter the goal is to eliminate the other players through the lose/win conditions built into the cards. In the case of Lost Legacy there are a few more cards plus the Legacy that is hidden in the deck and influences the final results.
 

There are at least 4 decks of Lost Legacy and the cards from these decks can be combined. They are sold in pairs of two decks.
 
If you enjoy the principle of Love Letter and want more of the same with a little more complexity you can't go wrong for the amount this costs (I think 12 euro for two decks).
 

I'd be willing to play this again. We didn't buy it however, as we already own the Munchkin Letter. Also not sure about replayability.

RATING: 8
This combo had my absolute least favorite set in it, that being the Whitegold Spire. It has a few interesting cards in it, but man, the whole thing just feels really random, and comes off as more frustrating than anything else, least of all strategic like the other Lost Legacy sets. Vorpal Sword was a super cool set though, and is one of my favorites! So, in a way, it truly makes up for the lack of goodness in Spire.

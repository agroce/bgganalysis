151117 Classic, still holds up.

101120 I  have played it on and off over the years but somehow fell into playing it big time for a three day period while vacationing in China.  Wow, its a fun game with a surprising amount of depth.  In the end, the memory element of the game will most likely turn me off for playing it too much, but heck, if you're bored or just out of it, Hearts can be a great way to while away the time!

RATING: 8
My favourite traditional card game.  I love the tension of trying to shoot the moon.  While there is obviously some luck with the card deals, this is mitigated a lot by the brilliant passing mechanism.  My least favourite part of the game are the no pass rounds where you can get totally screwed.  

I played this a lot in high school.  We played with lots of table talk and would always announce after the pass if we thought someone was trying to shoot, which led to a fun meta-game.

RATING: 10
For me, without a doubt, the best card game going.  I enjoy Whist and Poker, too, but this one has more depth than those and much more lightness than Bridge.
I've probably played this more than any other game on the planet.  Have had several groups of regular players and played many, many times in pubs.
I prefer the English rules, where each heart is worth it's point value - so Jack to Ace is worth 11-14.  Having said that, I've played the American version (all hearts worth only 1) many times, too.  I usually use the 10 of diamonds, which is worth minus 10 to your score.  That adds a twist, but it's very hard to win!  Rollicking fun.  Decisions at every turn.  What do you pass? Can you void in a suit?  Can you force another player's cards out?  Can you shoot the Moon?  Lovely!

Trick losing games are a lot of fun as a change if you are sated with the middle-ranking trick takers of comparable complexity (like Five Hundred).  Hearts also gets points for being good with three players.  But then it loses lots of points for having too many commonly played variants in which shooting the moon gets too many points.

Gains points because it's easy to learn and quick to play.  Loses points because the strategy is just too simple and interesting decisions rarely seem to crop up.  Might be a good introductory game for trick taking, but Spades really serves the same purpose, only better.  Doesn't seem to fit a very good niche; if you want a "family fun" game that is accessible to everybody (ie. kids as well), then Uno is better.  If you want a more competitive family game, then you want to move on to the games with more depth, like Spades or Bridge.  It's playable, but certainly not exciting.  I know this game as a cult following, and to people of that cult I say, please don't kill me.

If it wasn't for the capacity to shoot the moon, this game would lose a lot of it's shine. Not just because shooting the moon is tremendously fun and gives me a sense of accomplishment, but because it means one has to pay attention during play in order to prevent it from happening, and because it varies the types of hands which are good.

Passing also includes some opportunity for clever play, by helping you build a certain hand, but also by giving you information about who has what.

By forcing players to follow suit, it gives one an idea of who has what. You also get a good idea of what people have in their hands from their early leads.

A downside is, though, that it is often the case that there are no decisions regarding the last few cards played in a hand.

Also, it sometimes happens that you get a dog of a hand and have little control, just being forced to pick up the Queen of Spades, plenty of Hearts, but, without the good cards necessary to shoot the moon.

As well, it can be frustrating when you see players not blocking a shooting of the moon attempt, or not stopping the player in last place from going out even though that means they won.

In the end, the biggest problem for me is the necessity to count cards to do well. I despise counting cards, but knowing that you are holding the final cards in a suit is essential when determining how to play.

Winning tricks with Hearts is bad, but getting the Queen of Spades is a b*tch.  Probably the best 4 player non team trick taking game.  Easy and quick to learn, but difficult to master.  Always great satisfaction throwing that Queen of Spades to someone other than yourself.  Awesome when able to Shoot the Moon as well (collecting all Hearts and Queen of Spades) Makes all other players lose 26 points instead of you gaining it, unless it would end the game with you not in first, then you subtract points.

RATING: 6
Hearts (aka: Reverse) is a classic trick taking game that I probably would like more if I hadn't played Spades into the ground first. Hearts is much more simple in comparison, as players are only looking out for themselves, the goal is to avoid rather than to take tricks (which is always easier and less interesting to me) and there is no bidding.

On the positive side of things, Hearts is playable in 3 player groups, and it is an easier game to introduce newbies to...and because they aren't stuck on your team, there aren't the moments of extreme tension that Spades can produce.

All of this said, there are a lot of trick taking games around these days. I don't mind playing this game, but it will only get the nod when someone else (or a non-gamer) requests it as there are just too many things that I prefer to it as straight pitching games like this are the least interesting variation of the trick-taking family to me.

Also try: From Wikipedia:

Double-Pack Cancellation Hearts is a variant of Hearts for 5-11 players.

With a large number of players Hearts can be played with two packs. This allows each player to hold more cards and gives a four-person feel to the game. However, this means that there are two of each card and can lead to confusion about which is the highest card to take the trick. The normal convention when playing with two decks is that identical cards cancel each other out. For example, if hearts is lead, and both Aces (of Hearts) are played, then they cancel each other out (yet still count as points) and the next highest card takes the trick. If all the cards on that trick are either cancelled out or do not follow the suit, then they go to whoever takes the next trick. If the trick happens to be the last trick of the hand, then the trick is won by the second of the two highest-value cards.

This double-pack variation also adds a strategy often called “The Aardvark,” in which a player leads the queen of spades hoping that the other player holding the queen of spades will also play it, thus cancelling them out from being the highest cards, and giving 26 points to the unfortunate player who takes the trick.

5 players

A 5-player game is played with two packs of 52 cards and a joker (giving a total of 105 cards; 21 for each player). The joker starts the first trick and is treated like a "zero of clubs", meaning that all the other players have to follow in that suit and that the joker cannot win the trick (unless all the other cards in the trick cancel out).
6 players

A 6-player game is played with 102 cards (two packs of 52 cards, excluding one 2♣ and one 2♦). Each player gets 17 cards. The first trick is started by the other 2♣.
7 players

In a 7-player game, each player gets 15 cards (giving 105 cards in total; two packs of 52 and a joker). As in a 5-player game, the joker starts the first trick.
8 players

An 8-player game uses 104 cards (2 packs of 52 cards, excluding a 2♣ but including a joker). Each player gets 13 cards. The joker starts the first trick.
9 players

A 9-player game is played with 99 cards (two packs of 52, excluding one 2♣, both 2♠ and both 2♦). Each player receives 11 cards. The remaining 2♣ starts the first trick.
10 players

This game is played with 100 cards (two packs of 52, excluding one 2♣, one 2♠ and both 2♦). Players receive 10 cards each. The remaining 2♣ starts the first trick.
11 players

An 11-player game involves 99 cards (two packs of 52, excluding one 2♣, both 2♠ and both 2♦). 9 cards are given to each player. The first trick is started with the other 2♣.

Alternatively, an 11-player game could be played with 154 cards (three packs of 52, excluding two 2♣). Each player gets 14 cards and the first trick is started with the remaining 2♣.

[1 play since 2005] I've played the computer version of this a lot, which was how I learned, and only a few times in real life.  There really seems to be a big difference between the 3-handed and 4-handed game; with 3 people your suits are longer and it's just harder to maneuver.  I don't like this as much as Spades, but would enjoy playing more with people and getting to know the game better. As usual with classic games, there are variations in the rules: I absolutely can't tolerate anyone who plays with the idiotic jack of diamonds rule.

RATING: 7
I don't much like trick-taking games in general, but this is my favorite one!

Every player plays for himself, but you have to form temporary alliances in order to make the player in the lead eat the queen. I also really like that you can't just blindly throw away point cards because if everyone does that, then the fourth player will shoot the moon.

It does have some built-in screwage and sometimes the cards - and the constellations - just don't go your way. If you've ever lead with the 4 of hearts and ended up eating 16 points (3 of hearts, 2 of hearts, Queen of spades), then you know what I'm talkign about.

I love Hearts to pieces but only occasionally get into a game (though I just got my Hearts AI working!). If I happen to have four people willing to play a card game our inclinations tend towards things like Bridge or Sticheln instead. That said, there was a time when my friends and I would hang out at a high-school friend's house all day and night, every day and every night. I suspect a lot of kids had friends like this with homes amenable to a communal kind of congregation. We would hang out and listen to hardcore and the B-52s and talk, Tarot (divination), and play card games. One such game was Hearts. The games would go on all night and only end due to one or more players falling asleep at the table.

This is my preferred method of playing Hearts.

2014
====

My logged plays are a few orders of magnitude too few as I played this countless times on lazy days and nights in high school... in between skating sessions or while waiting for punk shows to start.  I've seen relationships ruined and fist fights break out due to hearts.  I had a friend in school who's parents were absent most of the time and as a result his house was the place to be -- day and night -- night and day -- any day of the week.  Many a games of Hearts happened at his house.

All told I've probably played close to 200 games of Hearts in my life, most happening back in the day.

[Original comment] This is a favorite family card game. We play what I consider the original version -- no Hearts or Queen of Spades on the first trick -- with no other variation.

We usually have 5 players, so there is no Pass Across round. The first trick with a Heart or the Queen of Spades also catches the extra two (face-down) cards left over from the deal. Sometimes this includes the Queen of Spades, which is a nasty surprise for the person catching the first Heart trick.

May 2009 -- It had been quite a while since we played Hearts, until recently. We decided to play a game of it, and my grandson played with us for the first time. He did very well, and we may play it more often in the future.

October 2011 -- I believe this has become one of the favorite games of our teenage grandson. He requests it often, and we all enjoy playing it.

November 2012 -- I've played Hearts since I was in college in the early 1960's, and I enjoy it as much today as I did then. Our family often decides to play a quick game of Hearts (to 75 or even 50 points), to end a game day.

2013-November:  Still a family favorite, especially to end a game day.

Definitely one of the best card games ever!  Love the fact that you can play with anyone anywhere with just a simple deck of cards.  Brings back a lot of college late-night memories...

RATING: 4
A traditional trick-taking card game that is easy to learn, but takes some strategy in planning out your hand.  The goal is to avoid taking points, with each heart card being worth 1 point, and the queen of spades being worth an evil 13 points.  The most interesting part of the game is the possibility of one player "shooting the moon" by taking all of the point cards, thereby reversing things and giving 26 points to all other players.  You can either plan to do this when dealt a particularly good hand, or try it if you're forced to take lots of point cards early on.  The main way that you'll fail to shoot the moon is when someone blurts out that you're trying to do so.  In general, the game is highly dependent on the hand you draw, and it is nearly impossible to fail in shooting the moon with some hands.  This is especially true if the other players are primarily conservative and you can react to that by holding onto more of your high cards, which will be added to those they pass to you.

Perfectly good, classic, trick-taking game.  I try to "shoot the moon" too often, but pulling it off is the best part of the game.

RATING: 7.1
Nov08: Ah yes, hearts.  A staple of my high school days.

It gets big dibs for a couple things:

A. The mean spiritedness of dropping the bitch on someone.
B. The tension of someone trying to shoot the moon.

It loses a ton of appeal for not being a partnership game in my book.  I like the team spirit in trick taking games, and Hearts just does not bring that.

Still, I won't turn down a game at a family gathering.

One of the first trick taking games I learned, great game that plays great on the computer thanks to windows, different enough from all the other games to still play the occasional time, fun giving people the "bitch" (kind of like the old Maid in game of the same name

Turbo Hearts varaint - 6 (rating) - At first I thought holy random screwage, but then I started to like it, its kind of like there is more than one nasty queen in play, but when you get one of the extra ones you can choose whether or not to make it nasty so you have some control over that aspect, and when you are long in suit you can sit back and wait to plug someone with it sometimes even picking your target like the person winning.  On the other hand, it can be hard to protect against them, you do know at beginning of round which nasties are coming but if you don’t have the cards to protect yourself your doomed.  Good fun anyway.

Ok game. Pretty much at its best on the computer where you can play very quickly. I played a game in person recently and it was crazy how slow it went. It's a simpler and more casual game than bridge so counting cards and my memory issues don't come up here to the degree they do there.

One group I'm in has a subculture of Double Deck Cancellation Hearts players.  Most of my plays of Hearts are DDCH, although occasionally, we don't have enough and we play straight Hearts.  This group almost always has a Hearts table at every Games Night, but I'm usually in on the eurogames or party games instead.  Update: we don't really get a critical mass of hearts players any more, so we're usually just playing eurogames.

I learned this around many a holiday-dinner-table. My dad and grandfather taught me how to play. Inevitably, we would rope my mother or sister into playing with us. Dad would always try to shoot-the-moon, I was always a point-avoider who liked to hold "the Witch" and my grandfather liked to ruin your hand on the pass. We knew what we liked and what we were good at and we had a great time.

This is my favorite card game with a standard 52-card deck.

This is still probably my favorite trick taking game, even though I've learned many others.  I think it's probably because the rules are so simple yet there is still a lot of challenge.  Also, because I've played this countless times I feel much more competent as a player than in the newfangled euro trick taking games, which sometimes (Sticheln, Schnappen Jagd) feel so counterintuitive.

Played it from 9am to 5pm in my first years at University. We were completely addicted to it. The winner would win 1 EUR and the second place would get 0.50 EUR. Sometimes we went for 2 - 1 EUR games (when we felt lucky and when we needed the money for tobacco or food)... Sometimes there was a big queue of waiting players - the second place would then leave at the end of the game. This left the winner and both loosers in the table.

RATING: 3
This is definitely a fairly strategic trick taking game, but it combines a lot of things I don't like: trick taking, heavy memory of what other people have played, some metagaming without cool special ability cards to make such metagaming interesting, and the fact that a person who has no idea what they are doing can totally mess up the game for other players. While for example in Race this could also be the case, in Race unless the new player plays completely randomly being able to to outguess what the newbie is going to do and taking advantage of that is part of the strategy. Here, a newbie can give someone cards that are quite excellent for their hand without any inclination at all that they are doing so, and there is nothing the other players can do about it.

One of my favorite classic card games -- simple and vicious. I would nearly always rather play Wizard (which has a very similar appeal, but with the dial turned to 11), but I thoroughly enjoy Hearts.

Points avoidance is one of my favorite mechanics overall. I enjoy trying to play games "backwards," and I tend to be pretty good at it. With Hearts, my favorite things are drawing a shitty hand and trying to make the most of it -- and drawing an absolutely fabulous hand, and making everyone else miserable.

There's no crying in Hearts.

A classic and favorite from college and for my family. I probably played it on average once a week sophomore year, and I should probably double it for plays outside that.

GeekBuddies seem to have the same reaction to this game as they do to Euchre, pointing out Spades and Tichu as preferable, more interesting alternatives, but there seems to be a bit more of a baseline of support for Hearts due to the ability to shoot the moon and its ability to play three. I haven't played Spades enough to know whether I prefer it, but I can certainly agree with the sentiment around Tichu, though that's really a 4-player game and is a lot tougher to teach.

A three-player game of this a while back convinced me that three-handed is not anywhere near the game that four-handed is (I believe I recall the kitty just being randomly infuriating), but four-handed is a fine game.  None of the people I play with frequently have any desire to use the jack or ten of diamonds rule, so I haven't much experience with it; "standard" for me is therefore Black Lady (does anybody actually play "Hearts" as according to Hoyle these days?), two of clubs has first lead, rotating pass of three cards.  It varies (between groups) whether or not the first trick is safe.  Shooting the moon requires the queen; usually the shooter gets their choice of -26 or +26 for all opponents.

A fun and fairly straightforward trick-taking game, good for practicing card counting.  Shooting the moon is really what makes the game, IMO; passing and play become a lot simpler if you don't have to worry about being able to stop someone else from taking all of the points.

I used to play Hearts quite often and for what it is it's an ok game. Shooting the Moon was always a fun twist to pursue...except for when you miscalculated and it didn't quite work... doh.

Now that I have played the game a fair bit though it doesn't have any real draw and is something I'd rather not play. Even with just a deck of cards there are better games to play.

Good card game.  While the strategy does get more or less obvious after you play this game a number of times, it is still a lot of fun.  I think the player interactions are what really make this game great (like dropping queens on people and passing terrible cards).

RATING: 6.5
Deal out an equal number of cards to all players. Start playing out the hand, but each hearts are turmp, and each heart you take is worth a point and the Queen of Spades is worth 13 points. Lowest score wins, so you want to avoid taking hearts. However, there is the option to take all the hearts and Queen of Spades, which is worth -25 pts. One of the earliest games with trump, and easy to play, with strategy as well. I would still be playing it were it not for the multitude of trick taking games out there.

Game I grew up with.  Taught by the best teacher; my Grandfather.  It has been a family favorite for as long as I can remember.

We play the American version.  A heart is worth a single point, and the queen of spades is 13 points.

A masterpiece. Considering how old this game is, it would be remarkable if it was playable to any extent, but Hearts exceeds that by being deeply strategic and full of excellent design. It's also amazing how well this works at various levels of play; just throwing down cards and trying to avoid the Queen is fun, but there are a ton of cool tactics that interact with each other to give this game lasting appeal. Learning how to aggressively shortsuit yourself, manipulate the lead, count remaining suits, predict other players' cards based on their previous plays, bluff and counterbluff those players, and account for the current game score is all stuff that keeps experienced players coming back but doesn't scare new players away. Plus, no other individual game is so good at uniting players into a team in certain situations; heroic moments where two or three players close to 100 points must work together are common and always awesome. 150 years later and this game is still the best reason to own playing cards.

It's a shame in a way that most people's only experience of this game is playing against 3 very dumb computer opponents on a Windows PC (it's certainly the primary way I know the game). It's probably a good game when played with humans - I think I've even done it once, many many years ago.

Hearts is a great twist on the familiar trick-taking formula.  There's no trump, and instead of trying to win tricks, everyone is trying to lose them!  In Hearts, point cards (any heart + the Queen of spades) are undesirable and thus everyone playing is trying to dump them in a trick someone else is winning, which makes for a very cutthroat, but highly satisfying game once you get a feel for it.  

I like playing with the extended rule that the Jack of diamonds is worth -10 points (which is a good thing).  It makes the choices more interesting as you're trying to dump those point cards, and it also makes it so someone who gets stuck with that nasty Queen of spades can still salvage the hand with fewer points.  

Hearts is great fun, but can be very nasty- make sure everyone is in the mood for such a cutthroat game!  I like that it can play from 3 to 6 players- not a lot of trick takers do well outside the rigid "4 players" range.

Probably the best introductory trick-taking card game, but it isn't very deep. Once you're familiar with the rules, the game "plays itself". The Chinese version is more interesting. Spades beats Hearts too.

My relatives play this Chinese version ('Roll the Pig'), which doesn't add much...

- 2-5 of Hearts do not give any points, J/Q/K/A of Hearts are +20/30/40/50 points
- Queen of Spades ('Pig') is +130 points
- Jack of Diamonds ('Goat') is -10 points
- 10 of Clubs doubles your points (including if it's negative)

Well, I don't specifically OWN a game of hearts, but I do own several decks of cards.  Hearts is easily one of my top 2 or 3 games played with a standard deck of cards.  I've played everything from 3 handed to 7 handed, and had fun at all of them.  It seems to me that this game allows for good play moreso than most standard card games.  It's also a great game to play with people who "never get anything good".  Of course, once they play, all they will ever get is high cards -- which isn't necessarily bad -- if you know what you're doing.

I've only played this once--and lost horribly--but I was very impressed, nonetheless.  There's some serious depth here, and you only need a deck of cards, a scorepad, and four people to play.

RATING: 5
It's a'ight, but it ain't no spades.  I do like how mean it is.  This is one of the first games that I played with any real strategy.  This is also one of the first games that showed me that I can respect a design without enjoying the actual game.  It takes a rare trick taking game to get me going.

Not keen on winning the game with shoot the moon, and prefer other players scoring full points instead

RATING: 5
It's just not that interesting as card games go. It's above Rummy and the like, as those are mostly luck-based, and at least you have the elements of passing, but there's no trump and no bidding. Spades has all of these elements and is still pretty playable by many (before you get to other cool games like Doppelkopf, Pinochle or Bridge).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I'd rather play bridge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I go in phases on this. Play it for awhile and then don't play it for years. I think the best part has to be the interaction and swapping of cards. If you can't get a Bridge group together then this is the next best alternative.

I play this in spurts, occasionally playing many many games (albeit on my Palm). Used to play more in high school and college. Decent game, fun shooting the moon.

A good card game when you have 4 players, one of those that is not very innovative or suspenseful but delivers with a relaxed mood and simple type of fun, occasionally I enjoy this.

RATING: 6
The players make this game.
I play this every other day with a group.  Since we all know each others style and play for fun, I like it a lot.
I also play online and the quality of play declines depending on who I'm stuck playing with.

After over 100 games played, I'm pretty much done with this game.  
Within my group, since we're all at the same level, the luck of the draw determine the winner for the turn.  
It's just not fun for me anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The classic game of Southern Fandom.  Queen of Spades counts as a heart for purposes of hearts being broken or led.  Hearts may be played on first trick.  Left of dealer (not deuce of clubs) leads to first trick.  A player may ask "Are hearts broken?" but not "Are hearts split?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I love hearts.  I don't love that it can be played with 4 and only 4.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
[Poker game] {Card; trick-taking; optimal 4p} Hearts is an interesting trick-taking game. The card exchange action is crucial to Hearts because it provides more tactical options and increases player interaction. Playing too defensively is not good because it will let a player 'shoots the moon' easily.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Very light card game, but interesting none the less.  IMHO not much fun against MSFT computer opponents.  They suck too bad. I'd rather play almost any game though.

RATING: 7.5
One of the better trick-taking games out there.  It can be pretty intense, particularly if you're trying to shoot the moon, but not look like you're shooting the moon.  Like, I dunno, playing casual.

There is a lot of strategy in what you pass left/right/across/each way.  I'm usually up for a game of hearts.

I like this trick taking game, the point system is pretty cool.

Can you "own" hearts?  I own several decks of cards so I guess that qualifies.

dropping down a little bit for me; a card game that is driven by a strong memory element, which is OK but not my preference. Also can be messed up by the interactions of all four players. still a very good game but I prefer more in depth card games.

Fun, light game of trick avoidance. Let's face it, at this point in time, Hearts is a classic. Still, I find the game play too straightforward. The real challenge is in shooting the moon, which can be a bit of a gamble.

My favorite public domain game. Everyone needs to be at about the same ability, or the newbie(s) will be annihilated. Play about 100 hands on the computer, then you'll be ready for f2f games. The key to successful (of course): do whatever it takes to NOT take the queen of spades!

I have coworkers who play every week, so I will occasionally join them. I cannot count cards and don't try, so I just play very defensively and actually end up with very few points, most hands.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I never get to play this except against online opponents.  This makes me very very sad.  The limited knowledge of what your opponent wants to do, based on the card passing.  The "Shoot the Moon" mechanism makes this trick take game fun.  I prefer the Black Mariah variant... which is pretty much consider the traditional hearts game.

A classic in the standard deck of cards type of game, I'm sure I'd play it here and there but most likely will keep it to internet hearts.

RATING: 8
A fine trick-taking game. I played easily over 500 times during my college years. Probably over a thousand. But we did have pretty girls playing, so I can't say up to what point I was playing for the fun and challenge of the game alone.

[thing=6887][/thing] do have a lot of luck built into it, but in every card game, in which you are dealt a big hand of cards (13 cards) this will happen. But, at least, you can do two things to counter this:
a) pass 3 cards to other player (and receive three);
b) shoot for the moon: if you take all the scoring cards (i.e: all the Hearts plus the Queen of Spades) it will be all the other players that will receive 26 points.

Even if I don't love the game (at least as much as I did some years back), I probably won't say no to a game of it.

RATING: 6
Classic trick-taking. Haven't played much in person, but some cool psychology, and shooting the moon is always a cool thing to achieve.

RATING: 7.5
Most people might put this below Spades on the trick-taking complexity ladder (no bidding), but it has a charm all its own as opposed to simply being a step on the ladder that ends with Bridge.  Ducking tricks can often be trickier than trying to take them, and it can scale to numbers other than four.

Since we played this on a game night and it's in BGG, it has to get listed in here.  Played this a good deal with family members early on.  I think I prefer Euchre (4) or Sheepshead (5) because with good players there really isn't much wiggle room to Shoot the Moon.  You'll get junk in the pass and always pass junk.  Euchre 4 has the team going for it while Sheepshead 5 has the silent partner.

This is my favorite of the light card games with a standard deck.  It is a nice diversion on long car or bus rides, because everyone knows it.  It gets an extra point from me because I play it all the time with my parents.  I have fun treating it more like a socialization game and less as a real brain-burner.  Once you reach a certain skill threshold, it becomes about counting cards, which I usually despise, but in this game gets masked by the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia.

This game is just too mean compared to other perfectly fun trick-taking games. While I enjoy the tension between blocking people from shooting the moon and avoiding points altogether, the negative feeling that you get when you get the queen of spades is not fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like many in my generation, I've played this far more on the computer than in person. A fun game that plays quickly. It feels like one's hand dictates one's moves much more so than in most card games, but I've also found I consistently win against the AI and consistently lose against human players who have a lot of face to face experience, so I think reading people must be important as well.

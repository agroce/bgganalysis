While the metagame and double think around this could run indefinitely between a pair of equally skilled players, the gameplay itself is too simple to ever have me pulling this out except as a 2-player filler.

A very clever game.   The game is about trying to make your hand and the pool total to the same value (or as close as possible with the pool being higher). Managing your hand and the pool size simultaneously such that its your opponent that makes the pool and your hand match thus allowing you to call for the scoring. Delightful and quick, this also has the possibility of becoming an 8.

Got in 1 quick game of this and really like the potential this has. First game was 11-10 with 11 on the table. With 4 simple choices each turn: play a card to the table, take the top table card and permanently put it in front of you, discard a 6, or end the round. The goal is to get as close to the total on the table without going over. So quick and simple, but a fun bluffing/deduction game. This could surpass Love Letter for me as the quick micro game that I enjoy the most. I got to play with the Khmer tile edition, but looking forward to see what Pegasus does with this.

Owned as a subset of a traditional deck. Pocketed in rules.

After my first play, I REALLY like this game. A lot of interesting bluff and deduction in 15 minutes and 16 cards. I imagine this game can be played at a pretty damned high level. I feel like I'm just scratching the surface. And that is not usually the case with short games.

Khmer/Elements is a numbers (without suits) game of posturing and bluffing. The rules are simple and the game has some depth considering the few components the game is composed of. If you want to play this you can simply use the some of the cards in Lords of Scotland/Parade/Battle Line and add a few tokens. At the time of writing this, I'm kind of at a loss as to what to say as I've lost every game of this that I've played. I don't dislike it, but I guess I can't help but feel this is very opaque to me. If you enjoy 2-player games that get you in your opponents head, this is the one for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not sure exactly what to think about Elements.  It feels like you should be able to just mentally run the numbers out and make it a game of probabilities, but it is OH-SO-MUCH-MORE.

An interesting observation, the metagame (and there will be a metagame) has been different with each opponent.  

The over-sized cards are high quality and the artwork is great, but this is one of the few times where I will say that the theme is literally just pasted on.  Don't let that deter you though, the game is superb...  I think.

Update: I am finding that at any given time it only takes a handful of plays to scratch the itch and be ready to play something else.  It's very much a filler, a clever and deeply satisfying filler, but a filler nonetheless.

Buen filler de faroleo y algún que otro cálculo. Genera mucho pique porque es muy corto y siempre te quedas con la sensación de que si esto o lo otro, hubieras ganado la ronda.

A quick, nifty game with just a few cards. I can see that there are many layers within this game and barely scratched the surface with initial couple of plays.

Khmer is a fantastic example of doing a lot with very little. That doesn't really change the fact that it is a fairly basic bluffing and double-guessing game (and one that undoubtedly gets better if you play it against the same opponent repeatedly) but for just 16 cards this is a great game.

Great little push your luck, bluffing and deduction microgame where you're trying to create a good hand of cards within a changing threshold. Every move the other player does tells you a little bit of what's in his/her hand, and I really like that the focus is on figuring out the best time to end the game. Short and sweet.

This very minimalistic game is, as I understand it, a game of chicken à la The Price is Right. The SAIEN version has great thick cards and great minimalistic art to match the character of the game. Not my usual cup of tea, but this game effectively achieves that which it sets out to do and that's always a thumbs up in my books.

RATING: 7
PNP Version assembled with standard cards, because I doubt I will be able to grab up an original copy quickly.

This small deck card game is basically a traditional card game with a Gin Rummy-like flavor, but with a twist: players can both increase and decrease the maximum value a hand is worth with played cards, and the sum is the maximum hand value.

Unlike Gin Rummy, cards in hand remain constant in value, so there are no books/runs/sets, but the drive to decrease hand value and the guessing game of what your opponent's hand value might be is very similar.

When players take up a card they cannot discard it later, making it a permanent part of their hand- so the Take action is powerful to defuse a high Play value, but also dangerous.

Khmer is a very clever, two-player small deck game. While I'd love to get my hands on an original set, I'm very happy that I can enjoy playing in the meantime!

This is a great example for "make much out of little". It's a very mathematical game that works on minimal rules, yet creates a good amount of tension. The graphical design looks like some art school presentation (and isn't practical or anything), but the cards do feel special (or should I call them tiles?). I am sure that if I play this more often, I will get better at it. Recommended for lovers of microgames (a single game takes under five minutes, although the game really shines if you play it up to six points).

This is 2-player competitive blackjack, in which the target number, rather than being static at 21, is manipulated by the players. It’s seems like a numbers game at first, then you realize it’s a mind game. If you've ever played Cold War: CIA vs. KGB, imagine that, but with no special powers and instead just all bluffing and doublethink.

RATING: 6
What a neat little game, plays in about 10 minutes and makes a great filler for two people.  There is a little more to it than it would seem from rules, but with 4 cards out of play its not a deep game (nor does it pretend to be).  

In summary, each player is dealt 6 cards and you are trying to reduce the total of your hand JUST enough to equal the ever-changing draw pile, by discarding a 6 out of game or by adding a card to draw pile.  So there is a little tug-of-war push-pull effect, but due to 4 cards missing and not known you are really left to guess whether your hand is higher than your opponents at any given time, even if many cards went back and forth.  You need to be equal to OR lower than draw pile BUT still higher than opponent to win, it is easier said than done, and some rounds DO get interesting and can be a little tricky when it gets to the point both know its very close.  This and the knocking player losing ties, is why its important to play a game to 6 points total. So if someone “thinks” it could be a tie and have no good play, at least they can forfeit and only let them win 1 point instead of 2.  

[u]Tidbit[/u] – Deal 7 cards each and only leave 2 cards out of the game.  Surprisingly it doesn’t change it that much but you do have a slightly better idea of what could be in other person’s hand.  Note that 6 cards each works just fine, I was just curious if this would improve the deduction aspect, maybe a tad but a little less than I thought.

RATING: 7
A sixteen card deck (2 x 1-5, 6 x 6) and a few cubes to keep score. That's all there is to it. Players are dealt six cards and the other four are set aside for the round. Players can play a card to the middle, take the top card from the middle and add it to the total in their hand, discard a "6" card, forfeit the round or "knock", which is declaring that you think you've won the round. To win a round, you need to have equal to or less value in your hand than is in the middle of the table. The player closest to the total on the table without going over wins the round and 2 points. You can forfeit to minimize the damage if you don't think you will win and your opponent only gets 1 point. First to 6 points wins.

The rounds go super-quick, but still manage to be interesting. Players both contribute to building the target number on the table while trying to balance it against their remaining hand value. The trick is that you want your opponent to play the card that puts you under so you can call it on your turn. So the game is about how to guide and influence your opponent, through card play, to play the card that you need them to. There's some guessing involved, some deduction, some luck. I like the game, but I don't know if there is enough variety to play it longer term. We will see. For now, it satisfies.

I have not found much strategy yet, though, after 9 rounds, but I can feel that there is something more to be discovered.

I liked the guessing aspect of it (like in Poker or Netrunner).

Simple but unusual mechanics make for a highly enjoyable little brain-burner. Would be a 10 for me with "proper" graphics.
Match play to 6 points is a must, since the game is only half as good without it.
Update: Raised from 9 to 10, never mind the graphics, this microgame is just awesome. Even if you eventually figure out what constitutes technically good play, it never gets old due to the psychological layer.
PS: If you like this game, do try its younger sibling "Gagario" as well!

Great 2p card game.  Easy to teach, with an element of bluffing and deduction.  Fast, exciting, and fun.  Can also be played with two normal card decks with the same card backing.  I prefer the minimalist approach of the original Khmer cards to the Elements deck, this is a game that thrives on minimalism.  This game gets better with repeated plays against the same opponent, to see how deep the rabbit hole goes.  Guessing, double-guessing, misdirection, it's amazing how much there is in a minimalistic, highly portable and approachable game, a real achievement.

Decent game, pretty much playable anywhere and with a standard deck of cards.  Use the black A,2,3,4 & 5 and all red face cards to signify cards of 6 value and you are away.  Playing matches is the way to go, and it quickly becomes apparent that you need to think ahead to try to manipulate the total in the centre to match or exceed (but only just!) that in your hand and drawn pile.  A handy amount of depth for 16 cards, quick enough to play before your food arrives, tidy enough to play on a plane.

I recently played about 20 games of this with my Dad and we went from "Is this even a game?" to "Wow how can 16 cards do this much!", then proceeded to discover 5 more levels to the game. It feels like mind reading, this is one of my favorite cases about how much information can be transmitted through such a tiny channel. The actions are so simple, and each one says so much. How can we know what is in each other's hand to this degree?  It is blatant voodoo!  Then, once we know (because somehow you know), the back and forth of adding cards to the field and removing cards from the field are one revelation after another!  Find a good partner and dive down this rabbit hole.

A brilliant little filler for two. On the first play, people usually say something like, "I don't understand why you would ever want to ... [i]oh[/i]" and the surprising depth hits them. It's even better with a bit of experience because of the element of bluff. An absolute gem.

Zimeon's suggestion of playing open-handed transforms the game so utterly it needs a separate rating. It definitely still works. I would be shocked if it can't be solved, but for mere humans like me it turns into a painful brainburner. Frankly, I'd rather have a 5-minute filler.

I own an ArtsCow redesign I made because the original was unavailable at anything like a reasonable price for 16 cards.

RATING: 6.5
[Pegasus Spiele 16 edition] {Elements; double-guessing; 2p} Elements is a unique 2p game.  Players complete to win multiple rounds by amassing 6 victory points.  Each round, they try to avoid busting by having a hand of cards which sum smaller than the central display.  The twist here is that the central display is built by both players.  So, if one tries to build a high central display, he/she can benefit his/her opponent.

The tension comes when one "Knocks".  One must be sure that his/her opponents can't win (either with a hand of higher value than the central displayer, or his value is LARGER than you but within the limit).  So calling a "Knock" is challenging because one will lose even with a tie.

Another funny action is "Yield" you can intentionally lose a round so that your opponents won't get 2 victory points, but 1 instead.  中文"投降輸一半"

I believe experienced players can bluff too.  Each round each player is dealt 6 cards, with 4 hidden.  So you can have a feel about your opponent's hard in certain degree.

It is an abstract game - the elements bring nothing to the game...

It is very easy to teach and learn this game (5 available actions with 16 cards).  However, it's challenging enough.  Good.

Giving that it can be played with any standard deck.  One can build their own themed version. The retail price of Elements would be high in many people's eyes.  But at least, we got pretty cool victory tokens :P

We use cards from an old Samba deck, but will soon buy three decks of Poker cards to cannibalize.  I like the simpler design of the original Khmer deck, but will certainly buy the Elements version if/when it becomes readily available.  We usually play this in half hour sessions, getting in as many hands as we can.  This is a wicked little game and we like it a lot.

RATING: 6
A simple game of trying to match your hand value to the table's value by playing a card to the table or picking up the top card from it or discarding a 6 value card. Meanwhile your opponent is trying to do the same, deducing the cards you hold and messing with the table value to throw you off or just plain bluffing to buy another turn to execute their plan. It comes together brilliantly but boy this game pisses me off so much, mainly because I get thumped every bloody time.

*Played using a standard deck

After playing a bit more I'm less enthused. Too many tied hands and not enough options. Still a decent game...

update: its fast and fun and fairly intersting so it is perfect as filler. Its hard to put it away.. its definitely fun and has some interesting thought to it as you try to figure what the other guy is holding, the 2 player version seems like a poor choice for a knocking game but a multiplayer version would not seem to work owing the way the value of the board changes. Seems more of the filler variety as it does not seem that deep. Not sure if this game will keep my attention but it is interesting for now. (may 2014) update jan 2015; still playing this and like it even more. A few house rules make it more interesting  Its fast, exciting and thinky, very good filler choice.

Unlike any card game I've ever played. Two players play cards to the table, trying to push the total value above what is left in their hand so they can be the closest without going over. And if either thinks they are going to lose, they can fold to only give their opponent half a win.

There is bluffing, deduction, hand management, risk-taking, calculation, a need for clever play and a dramatic showdown in every hand... So much is going on with these 16 cards. I can't get enough. 

Finally found a copy in late 2016!

So simple and so addictive. Amazing that such a highly mathematical game works so well with two. It's not a zero sum game because four cards are removed from play but there is still a great tug of war after a couple of cards have been played to the table. Do you play a card and thereby risk your opponent winning or do you take a card from the table postponing that choice? The Japanese version is (of course) beautifully produced.

If Go is a ritualized philosophical conversation, Khmer is the Zen wink.

[thing=73313][/thing] is a beautiful, minimalist card game (16 cards) that is very different than the boisterous dynamic of recent small games such as [thing=131357][/thing], [thing=129622][/thing], [thing=112373][/thing]. Instead, it's a zen tug of war, competitive yet pulling the two players into close sympathy. It prompts a metagame that builds within 15 minutes into a winding deductive chase, and it's cool how the mechanics can move the game back and forth in time to gather information. It has an aesthetic mindfulness in look & in play.

It's brilliant.

Always play with the full rules rather than a single hand. 2 for a win, 1 for a fold, winner is the one who gets to 6. It makes all the difference.

Another microgame with a unique twist for two players. The rules are quite simple, but it is quite tough to wrap your head around the strategies to win this game consistently. This game could boil down to simple deduction if not for the four cards that are set aside. These four cards that are omitted makes the game less of a deduction and more of a "lucky" guess. I would rate this game higher if rules were somehow incorporated to reveal the four cards that are set aside during the course of game play. Perhaps an extra action to draw or reveal cards? Saien should try to see if they can jigger the rules a bit.

In any case, this game is a solid design that will provide some delights but its longevity on the gaming table is at present, unclear.

Really requires dedicated plays with the same player(s) to fully explore. First few games felt random and arbitrary, but further play revealed subtleties not initially apparent.

I expect the rating to grow if I can get it played more regularly.

UPDATE: Absolutely has more depth than initially appears, it's amazing how eloquent such a simple game can be. Raising rating.

Great 20 min. filler for 2. It has a tension similar to Battle Line. But the feel is quite different -- almost as if both players try to step as close to the line without going over. Luck is involved, but it is managed by both players.

Highly recommended.

This is a great little game! I'm really impressed with the small 16-card games that I have played so far. This one starts out feeling rather light, but you quickly realize that there's lots of clever play hiding beneath the surface. The 6-point matches are definitely how the game should be played, and folding should always be considered a way out instead of giving up another point by losing. I highly recommend this.

Upgradet to a 9. This is amazing. I rated it a 5 because I simply didn't understand what was going on; it plays so quickly that the beauty of the game completely escaped me (and my gaming pal, and we're neither dumb-wits) even after 10 plays.
This is a fantastic and quick 2P game that invites small money betting. There are 16 cards with numbers on them; players take turns either playing one of the cards, increasing the value on the "board" and decreasing their value on hand, or picking up one card, doing the opposite. Sixes can be discarded, lowering your hand and not changing the table. A last option is to call the game, at which point you win if your hand is higher than the opponent's but lower or equal to the score on the table.
After trying it again, this game turned out to be awesome. There's some luck involved as a few cards are removed from each match, but generally, it's an educated guessing and bluffing. What's interesting is that this game is even playable with open cards; it's not at all blatantly obvious what the best choice is at any given point.

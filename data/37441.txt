An excellent, very clever, new take on a simple trick-taking game. A very worthy addition to the genre, and an ingenious idea.

Clever! But the melding rules end up being too constraining and the gameplay is not what I wanted it to be as a result.

RATING: 7
A game whose basic mechanics are similar to Die Sieben Siegel in that players bid to win tricks in specific suits or no tricks at all.  What makes Pala unique is its concept of mixing two primary coloured cards to create a higher value in a secondary colour.  Most interestingly, this can be done to a card led by an opponent in order to change the colour of the suite that will win the trick.  I think that Pala is one for the trick-taking geeks as there is barely any theme and it is quite cerebral.  As a trick-taking geek and I enjoy it.

Artwork and production are to the usual poor standards of Cambridge Games Factory.  At least the cards are of decent quality.  The rules are well-written and clear.

This is an interesting trick taking game, with some ability to change the suit being played mid-trick, though it is a little chaotic with six suits in 44 cards, only 40 of which are in play.

Essen '11: Wish it played 2 players... regardless, Pala is a solid trick-taking game (two, in fact) with a lightly-brushed theme (pun intended). This could go up or down a rating point dependent upon long-term replayability.

What a great trick taker!  Unfortunately, I don't get enough opportunities to play with 3+ players.  There's a lot of chances for screwage with the blending of colors.  Definitely need more time for discovery.

RATING: 6
Trick taking card game in which players must follow suit if able, but if not may play off or change the suite to another color. One play isn't enough, but I doubt I'll have another chance. You have some choice, but not the right choices at the right time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very fun trick taking about smearing and mixing paint colors. It has some take-that in the form of smearing someone else's color and offers quite a bit of choices for a trick taker. The only negative is that it is difficult to teach new players. Other than that it is great.

Might be able to use Rage cards : for primary, use 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10  but then halve (rounding down) to actually score them.  (2 & 3 -> 1, 4 & 5 -> 2, etc.)

(As of [b]2[/b] plays) Like many trick-tacking games, it can take a while to wrap your head around Pala, but once you do, the innovative color-blending aspect makes this a worthy addition to the pantheon of trick-tacking games. The dual scoring rules provide a lot of variety. Much better than I had initially expected.

RATING: 8
An actually-fresh take on trick-taking.  The mixing/smearing works remarkably well and the 2 sets of rules make this very flexible.  This is going straight into my "go bag" of games I carry around almost all the time.

Very tentative rating as this is a *very* different trick taker and it was clear we didn't really know what we were doing, but all-in-all I have very positive impressions so far.  Playing the version where you try not to get negative points felt reminiscent of Sticheln, but not so calculational.  The smearing/mixing mechanic sounds confusing at first, but it's actually fairly straightforward.

Pointillism: The idea of changing trick colours by mixng card colours is quite neat, but the game doesn't quite come together. There is probably a bit more control during the first couple of tricks of a round than is immediately apparent but on the whole it feels like the cards play you rather than the other way around. It's extremely dependent on the hand you (and the other players) have been dealt and swingy to boot.

Also, the target scores seem rather high for the 30 minutes the game is supposed to last.

RATING: 9
An innovative trick taking game that combines trick taking with the color palette. Very cool; very fun. Relatively easy to pick up the rules, and difficult to master. 

The game is accessible to gamers and non gamers alike I think. The poker chips in the packaging keep falling out. That aspect is terrible. The art/design is appropriate to the game though. The mechanic seems tailor made to CGF's design style.

The more I play this game, the more I love it. I have come to feel that it is in a league of its own for trick taking games. The depth added with that sensible color palatte mechanism is so incredible. I cannot think of a game that packs more of a punch for what's in the box than this one.

Extremely weird trick-taking game. The first play was a bit of a wash (no pun intended), but once you start to internalize the colour mixing mechanic things seem to come together. A fun variation on trick-taking that doesn't become obtuse.

Excellent excellent game -- I feared it would be a bland trick-taking game, but it didn't feel that way at all.  The way that the colors mix is fantastic, and I really like the mix of two game modes.  Great game!

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting. In the first round(s), this is a bit of a brain burner, at least it was difficult to wrap my head around it. Reading the rules was worse, as there are no images and it took me three runs to really understand them, although they are by no means badly written. 
If you survive the first confusion, this turns out to be a very clever trick-taking game with a very solid bidding system. We played with four players and got to 30 points after four rounds, which was enough for us (can be quite long if you play all the way to 70). But if it hadn't been late, we would probably have proceeded, as at least three of us four really enjoyed it. 

Production quality isn't great, unfortunately; but still, I recommend this to anyone fond of the trick-taking genre.

Two trick taking games in the box, called Impressionism and Pointillism.  With the former, you're trying to get the least points and with the latter, you're trying to get the most points.  I enjoyed Pointillism more.

Had the chance to learn this game at Essen '11, and was impressed. I don't follow the trick-taking scene, (I've enjoyed Bottle Imp), but this one does have a lot of fun. The theme of mixing colors is important, and works well with the the mechanics. 

Changing the color of a trick [I] while it's in play[/I] is fun.

Only Pointillism - This version left the impression that it barely works. To really work, players need the correct mindset. With four players, the only interesting rounds were the ones where one player made a null bid. With all players making a few bids, it was a crapshoot of getting the '5' in a primary colour and high secondary colour cards. Maybe, we didn't mix and smear enough but why if the safe way to score was easier. What remains is an interesting thematic idea and a trick-taker with a complicated mechanism not achieving much.

RATING: 7
POINTILLISM:

After my first play, I'm still struggling to wrap my brain around mixing and smearing and how to calculate accordingly for the bidding that occurs before the hand is played.  I'm not totally sure what is strong although I usually find 9s to be fairly safe as long as you don't lead off too early with them.  The smearing and mixing mechanism is clever and an interesting twist to a trick taking game.  The scoring is different as well as you score the product of the different color chips you bid and the number of tricks you take.  (or you can gain or lose points by going nil but that is slow going in 4-5 player games).  

IMPRESSIONISM:

Have yet to play this game.

Color mixing allows players to change trump on the fly in this trick taker. Looks highly interactive/disruptive. Metzler #14 2013.

Played the trick-positive game a couple of times. Like most, will take more plays to wrap my head around, but I am liking it. Really twisty.

This game deserves better than the 6 rating I currently have it at. The problem is that I can't get my head around how to bid and value the cards in my hand at all. I admire the game but I feel like a big dummy when I play it so far.

Hopefully that will change with increased plays.

Would love to give this one a try. Looks like a really interesting take (heh) on the trick-taking genre.

Update 2017: A hit with the in-laws. Great trick-taking game.

Based on one play: The use of colors gives this trick taking game a little twist where you can mix cards to change the suit that the original player lead. As with most trick taking games, you must follow the lead, however you can add a card to the lead player to change the color and then beat that new color which everyone must now follow. To score you must decide which colors you will win at least one trick in, the more you try for the more points you can get but miss just one and you get no points. Not sur the staying power, but would play it again.

It sounded like an intriguing trick-taker and that's exactly what it is! The 'trick' in this one is that you can play pairs of different-coloured cards to 'mix' a third colour.

An interesting take on a trick-taking game where it is possible to use two cards to 'smear' two cards into one summing up the result. Doesn't really work though. It's too rare to be able to smear and smearing results in players having different numbers of cards in their hand. A curiosity.

Neat trick-taking game where you bid for the colour of tricks you intend to take, but the twist is that you can "mix" two primary colours to create a secondary colour, which allows you to change the suit that was led or merge two cards to create one.

2012-09-14: [i](When playing with a mistaken rule that really diminished the experience.  Mistakes, and observations based thereupon, are scratched out herafter….)[/i] [b][bgcolor=#cc99ff] 5 [/bgcolor][/b] I love the concept:  I have started so many color-mixing game designs that it's ridiculous.  [-]The way it plays out is not particularly satisfying, though.[/-]  Smearing the led primary color, so that a secondary color wins the trick is thematically nice, and cruel to those who played/followed the led color.  [-]Part of the problem with[/-] the game [-]— which incidentally[/-] is impressively colorblind-friendly [-]— is that the traditional mandate to follow suit is extrapolated:  If you can't follow a secondary suit, you [b]must[/b] mix the requisite primaries to follow, if you can.  If you can't follow a primary suit, you [b]must[/b] smear by playing another primary and the resultant color, if you can.  This means that not only are your strategic options reduced through additional obligatory plays, but your cards are getting involuntarily burned twice as quickly.  Yes, you start to adjust your bids based on the realization that having one or two moderately big cards in a color probably means they'll just get bled out involuntarily; however, ultimately, you're even more buffeted by the waves of the current situation than you are in something like [thing=6901]Euchre[/thing].  In Euchre, your choices are so distilled that you can simply focus on those opportunities, and strike when you can.  In Pala, the added complexity just muddies the waters, and constrains the player more.[/-]

The [boardgameversion=126230]first edition[/boardgameversion] has excellent components: bright, beautiful cards, with the paint splotches shaped differently for each color, and the name of the color on the card; bold, tightly stacking bidding chips for each player (these aren't colorblind-friendly, but as long as there is one person in the group who is not colorblind, the worst it does is slow play slightly; if it's a problem, label them).  Of course, it still comes in the traditional, despicable plastic clamshell that is standard for [company=4569][/company].

To clarify, I do still wish to play this a little more, because I believe that the game could rise as high as a [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] for me, given dedicated opponents and opportunities to play.  …but I could be wrong.

Still, it's a very clever design!

2015-02-02: When I played this recently, I literally didn't even remember having played it before — perhaps because of the wrong rules.  Did I really flush my memory of them that thoroughly? Anyway, this does in fact seem like an interesting game I'd like to play more; however, it was made painfully clear to us that this definitely should not be a young player's first trick-taking game: Angrily confused.  I think I like it, though.  :)  Tentative [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] for me.

RATING: 10
By far, the most immersive and precise American Revolution game to date. 

This is a masterpiece, and it's shockingly more so because of the first time designer who took a tried and true system (COIN) and expertly adapted it to another time and age.

The game ebbs and flows with thematic presence. It's a profound and respectful reenactment of the critical period of time, not just from the formulaic "Brits versus Pats", but from the intertwining of influences and interests between the major powers (and a minor but important perspective of the original natives as well).

RATING: 7
Love the less abstracted combat through all out battle.

My only complaint with the coin games I've played is how much importance is placed on the support/opposition track (well no duh). I would like to see more all out combat and more battles just find myself frustrated with changing the influence in different regions. 

However, it works in these games and the plays are tons of fun packed full of tough decisions. 

Just don't go in thinking that most of your interactions will be duking it out on the battle field.

My wife and I have been playing this game.  This is the first COIN game we have tried.  It may be a perfectly good game but it is way to convoluted for our tastes.

For one thing, we even had trouble understanding the tutorial.  It seemed to us that the tutorial was suppose to be designed so one can read it without really going through the rules.  We found that there were several aspects of the games one could not understand without reading the rules.  So the tutorial really did not work as a stand alone learning tool.

After playing is a few times my wife did not like it and gave it a three (Note: She does play wargames.  Her current favorite is C&C Ancients)

Even with the problems I had I still rated it a nine.  That averages to be a six.

Follow-up.  Because of some unhappy experiences playing the game with live opponents, I gave-up on it and gave it away.

Fantastic game that had no players.  I'm not a big solo gamer and typically play with friends, none of whom wanted to make the leap to a game this in-depth.  

The board is beautiful, the production solid, the game play engaging, and the experience memorable.  But, ultimately, I'm a player and not a collector.  If a game is going to collect dust, there's no point in keeping it.  So I traded it away.

The victory conditions push the American towards avoiding fighting the British and focusing on crushing the Indians. I found this very un-historical and, bottom line, a let down. You do not simulate the ARW, but something else. Too bad because the design is elegant.

After two plays of this and two plays of Fire in the Lake, I'm tempted to start with "it's a COIN game" and stop there.  Right now I've got 3(?) more COIN games on P500 and I wonder whether they're different enough to merit keeping them all.  

However, with that caveat, I love the game.  Like all COIN games, there are 4 factions, British, French, Patriots and Indians, and while there are allies (British + Indians vs. French + Patriots), they all have their own objectives.  Also, notice that I keep putting the order as British, French, Patriots, Indians.  That's on purpose.  The Brits are the strongest followed by the French.  They're the super-powers.  I'm not sure if it's historic or not, but the French have a lot of muscle to throw around in the colonies.  The Patriots can do well, but have to be careful about killing Patriots because it often helps the French more then them.  So, in general, the Patriots want to pick on the Indians because (a) they need to for their victory condition and (b) it doesn't help the French.  But if they go off to the frontier to do this, the Brits swoop in and gets the support of the colonists.  It's a brilliant intertwined mess.  

At this point, I'm not convinced how good this is with 2 players.  I've played it with 2 and 4 and with 2, it seems too generic.  4 players creates some very interesting dynamics.  I'll certainly play it with 2, but I'd lean towards something else.

Initial Rating: 8

11-May-16: Just played my first game against the bots (I was Patriots + French).  The Bots are interesting and not nearly as cumbersome as I feared.  I'm not sure why people are saying the flowcharts are so tough.  They're non-trivial, but I'd say once you've played with them 2 or 3 times, the additional time should be minimal (consider them as though you're playing with a person with a little bit (but not terrible) AP).  What the Bots expect is that you know the actions for all the factions well.  If you have to go from the flowchart to the action player aid and then to the random spaces player aid, it can get cumbersome.  But, if you know the actions and just use one die when there are only two or three choices, I don't think it's bad at all.  

As far as the Bots skill, I'm not sure how strong they are.  There were a couple of unclear things (or things I might house rule for the Bots), but overall I thought they did well.  Opposition/Support always hovered around zero (+/-4) until the end.  In the final WQ, I got opposition 9 above support and that was as big a difference as there was all game.  (for the secondary win conditions, I led in Forts/Villages all game and in casualties by WQ3 or 4).  I do think in the future, I'll use the more advanced variant (if during any WQ, you're behind in marginal victory in your weaker faction compared to the NPC's strongest faction, you immediately lose).  That keeps me from playing the long game which was worked so well last night.

I'll definitely be looking to play with the bots more.  It's not as good as a 4-player game, but probably as good as a 2-player one.  With the bots (and with only 2 players), you miss out on the table-talk/deal-making between "allies".

At this point you probably know that I consider the COIN games to mostly be pretty tedious: long, grinding, whack-the-leader-feats at a ludicrous complexity level, and with generally an at-best cursory relationship to history.

But Liberty or Death is the most preposterous of the series. The history is a whitewash which fundamentally misunderstand and misrepresents the conflict (native Americans. Seriously?). The victory conditions are bizarre and fail as both any kind of plausible history and any kind of playable game.

"Aŭ la libereco, aŭ la morto: la Usona Ribelo" estas strategia ludo pri la Usona Milito de Sendependeco (1775–1783). 

Belega materialo (dika detala mapo, solidaj lignaj pecoj,...).

Mi unue ne ŝatis la longajn regulojn, kiuj unuavide ŝajnas nenecese komplikaj. Sed dum prova ludo, oni rapide lernas la sistemon.  Malgraŭ certa komplekseco kaj abstrakteco, oni finas la ludon tre rapide, kaj volas tuj reludi. 

Mi ne scias tamen, ĉu la ludo estas bona simulado : ĉu ĝi kreas sufiĉe akuratan bildon por lerni pri la historio de tiu konflikto? 

Batalo-ludo foje re-ludebla.

Flawed design. 
From historical POV putting four factions into game about AWI is way too artificial, especially in case of Indians, which were not a single faction and not a major faction, which presence drive conflict dynamics.
Same thing with French, because historical role played by them was different.
From gameplay POV shared victory conditions put players on uncomfortable "one-shoe" situation, when we are forced to cooperate, but with no means to stop our "ally" on his way to victory. There is a big kingmaking in this, because if we don't support shared VC's we don't win, but at the same time we help our rival, because there is only one winner.
Yes, of course, we may play 2-player game, but there is a much better game about subject - Washington's War.
Classic example of game, which do not fit into the system. COIN-less I would say.

A very good implementation of the COIN system. Well balanced and highly thematic. The battle mechanism is intricate and satisfying without being either deterministic or overly chaotic. The action set is clever and tactically rich, and the bot charts are reasonably well done. Also, the game has stellar components and art. 

Best played with 4, or 2 people playing 2 factions each. Another win for GMT.

My 2 aborted plays left me with nothing to love about this one. I want to like it, but so far, no.  The combat is an utter mess that should have been developed down into waht the system has used before.  The 4th faction of the Indians is forced at best.  I do like that that they made the Winter/Coup card immediate, and I will attempt to make all my COIN games uses that mechanism so you don't have that forced AP turn where players just spend a turn APing a way to stomp on the winner instead of just letting the game naturally come to an end.

So this is an update to my original review. Liberty or Death is a Euro styled war game, hence, the wooden pieces. For the type of game it is, the Euro styled mechanics play much better and make more sense. You have far more control over your actions and the points accumulation mechanic of the different factions is great.

Now this game differs from a Distant Plain in that there are dice and you use them in full on battles as opposed to skirmishes. So the random element is replicated in battles. However, the dice rolls are HEAVILY modified by your decisions. So the risk management element is very nicely implemented. And I can't really pinpoint what it is, but I prefer the theme of Liberty or Death over Distant Plain because of the subject matter. But that is only if I had to choose one over the other. I think both are needed to round out the Coin experience. I don't know enough about the other COIN games to comment. I got these two because they have different elements which lead to different play mechanics. And I think these play mechanics really do a great job of capturing the feel of the objectives during their respective time periods.

To be honest, I'm not a fan of most war games. This may change, but I've had bad experiences with some PC war games that have turned me off to the genre. Granted, they were considered to be mediocre. This one is different and that's why it appeals to me so much. I love the play mechanics. They keep me really engaged. I had to be pretty dang focused to learn how to play this game. But I did. And I played two rounds. Didn't have time to play the whole game. I played as every faction so that I could really grasp the mechanics of the game. The next time I play, I'll play with bots. And I'm really looking forward to it.

I really like the asymmetrical winning conditions. And also like that the winning conditions appear to be pretty just, relative to each faction, for all the factions. And I really dig having to buckle down to wrestle control of a territory from another faction.

I would say that the three coin games I have, Liberty or Death, A Distant Plain, and Fire in the Lake are my favorite games along with Dice Masters and Eldridge Horror. It's like these COIN games speak to me. Just reading the instructions to learn how to play was engrossing.

Update: Just played through a partial game as a way to learn the game better. I played as all four factions. And I must say that I absolutely love COIN! The great thing is that after playing all the games I have partially played and studying them intensely as I play, I am starting to really feel the differences that each game brings. Each COIN I have brings a completely different flavor and strategy or strategies to the game. They really do feel different once you know how to play. And I'm sure this difference and enjoyment will even get better once I know how to play well.

I have lawsuits coming out of my ears right now so I don't get much of a chance to play anything at the moment. But I'm still trying to make time to learn as much as I can right now so I can really jump into my games when I have more time.

Fun and engaging with true competitive cooperation. Less complex than most of the COIN games, but features very obtuse combat rules that takes some reorientation based on my own expectations.

Overall I enjoyed the progression of the game, but starting with the full campaign made us wished we started with the short scenario. I won as France by liberally giving the Patriots whatever they needed and triggering a few combat events. With the British in trouble I built up my readiness and pounced on the West Indies. I won without ever venturing onto the continent. Maybe the other scenario will put everyone at each other's throats?

Looking to play again soon, but my initial impression is I still prefer Cuba Libre.

Beautiful map art, marred by kinda sloppy layout of boxes (specifically the overflow boxes.

Missed opportunity to watermark the score track (see Cuba Libre)

There are a number of good games on the American War For Independence but this is my favorite.  Yes, a lot is abstracted and for purists who want more tactical and operational detail, this is not the game for them.  But the COIN system does a good job modeling the strategic factors and puts the four players in the right kind of mindsets that govern execution of strategy.  It does take a few playings to get the hang of the system and to begin to understand what to do in each turn, with a full awareness of the prospects and perils of each course of action!

My favorite of the COIN series, and the only one I'd actively like to play again.

As with all of them, you are constantly recalculating what you need to do based on what others are doing.

2nd play, both as the Indians.  In both games we had to quit before doing a full Winter Quarter card.  This prevents the game from fully being fleshed out.  I really want to play this again as either a different faction, or be able to play longer.

Vol V of the Coin series focuses on the Revolutionary War.  The most interesting new aspect is the locked alliances.  Each pair (patriots/French) and (british/native americans) shares one win condition to determine which pair wins and an independent victory condition which then determine which one of the allied pair wins.   I've only played once but the potential for dissatisfaction with your "ally" is delicious.

Not played yet, but the map-board is a wonder- it may be the most appealing one I've ever seen in a game. One of the more complicated COIN games, but one who's subject matter interests me the most. Others made a great point that the Indian & French  factions wouldn't better have been utilized via cards/card actions, & rather than Indians, Tories been used in their place. Honestly, it sounds like this would have been better suited as 2 factions on the board, British vs US Continental forces, with others mixed into the deck (not to repeat myself), but then it wouldn't be a proper COIN game. From my reading of the rules, this might be more work than fun.

RATING: 6
Update: After a few more solo plays, I think the victory conditions just do not work, and the game fails for that reason. Support/Opposition is trivially easy to control, but the other aspect of your victory, particularly casualties, is frustratingly difficult to make any progress on. So as a solo player, you are generally trying to keep your other half from winning. Or, if you play both factions of a side, it's a joke. I won my last game by over 100 points playing both the British and the Indians.

-------

The COIN system works so well for me solo, it's hard for a game to be any worse than Pretty Good. And the bots here are great, without being overly complicated.

But the victory conditions are so frustrating to play with, I never leave the game feeling satisfied. You often have so little control of whether you can win, or your partner wins.

This is one of the better games in the system. The rules are a tad cleaner but I am still not enamored with the layout and found this one a bit of a slog. 

In the end though, I still find this to be the most overrated game systems around, mostly due to rules overhead; there are a few too many fiddly parts. The series to me is a regression from CDGs (remember when those were the rage? ah, the good old days...well mostly) But what do I know? As of 2016 GMT has been laughing all the way to the bank with the COIN series.

Preliminary rating after one session (which we didn't finish, unfortunately). 

Great components, beautiful board. Mechanics-wise this is more complex than Cuba Libre for example, but still the clean, elegant COIN engine makes the real challenge figuring out what your factions best options are at any given moment.

I'm kind of on the fence regarding some of the mechanics - not a big fan of the combat system for example, as it mostly feels like an exercise in modified dice rolls. But overall this is a meaty, in-depth experience. And while it may not be 100% historically accurate (an "Indian" faction, really?) it still has some neat thematic dynamics going on. 

Looking forward to more plays.

Wow. Thick game!  Played the French the first time and I was happy to have some breathing room to figure out what was what.  We have to play this again.  My score of 8 could go higher once we play this a couple more times.  Right now the 4 different angles and rules, have me focused on the rules rather than the strategy.

That being said, a few General tips to the future me:
1. Massing an army of more than 10 doesn’t really help.  The goal is hearts and minds and not control.  However, control can help or hinder the influnce bit. 
2.  Attack in order to get “win the day” feature.
3. Look for the 1,2 combo attack with your partner.
4. Don’t worry too much about events.  Your action really matters.

For the French:
1. Use the early times to get your pieces active and ships out to get money.
2. Transfer money to US to get them going.
3. Cities matter.

Played as a co-op game with two players controlling either the rebellion or royalist factions and bots controlling the other side.

The game provides lots of interesting decisions, but the bots feel a bit clunky. The bots do get easier to handle once you've played a couple of games.

My rating (and understanding) of the game will most likely increase with more plays.

I love the COIN series, but this game goes to show that not every topic can get shoehorned into the COIN model.  Unlike Fire in the Lake, the locked alliances in Liberty or Death just do not work for a system where 4 factions, with their own agendas are competing for victory.  There needs to be much less overlap of victory conditions to make a system like this work in a 2 sided war.

I really wanted to like this one.  I P500 pre-ordered it and was waiting day by day for it to arrive.  It turned out to be a big disappointment.

Like FitL, LoD feels more like a traditional wargame than previous COIN. While not quite as utterly focused on the hot war as FitL, LoD still manages to ditch the green faction and focus more on battles with its CRT chart, battle modifiers, generals, blockades, etc. If it weren’t for the Native Americans I’d be completely disinterested in playing further. 

The game does introduce the more tightly knit team v team concept which is great, when your partner gets to play (see French sitting on the sidelines waiting for TOA and watching as the Patriots get tag-teamed by the Brits and Natives). While this makes the relationships between players more pronounced I can’t decided whether I liked it or am indifferent.

As I mentioned in my FitL comments, I prefer more modern treatments, with muddied goals across the socio-economic-politico spectrum rather than a "hot" war focus. But like FitL, I think LoD will be a hit amongst more traditional wargamers for its more focused look at battles and non-military-centric factions.

Adds some good twists to the system, but the quality has really been upped on the map art and the 4 factions represent very different challenges.

I really want to like this game, and I like many aspects of it. But how easy it is to win a war, or whether it is possible to win at all, is a function of your victory conditions. 
You can’t win a war without resources. It’s not impossible, but really difficult, to win a war if your opponent has easier access to resources than you have. 
So let’s look at the victory conditions and the economics of this game.
There are 4 factions: the British, the Patriots, the French and the Indians. Although this is said to be a COIN (counter-insurgency) game, its rules make it feel much more like a standard war game, albeit one between two sides with asymmetric victory conditions and access to resources.
During the Winter Quarters assessment, the victory conditions are as follows.
No Faction can win unless the absolute difference between Support and Opposition is greater than 10.  If the difference is positive, then the British and the Indians have achieved one of their victory conditions. If negative, the Patriots and French have one of theirs. A second victory condition depends on the difference in Cumulative Casualties of Patriots and British. If positive, the British, and if negative, the French, gain a second victory condition. The Patriots don’t have to worry about the casualties; they achieve a second victory condition if they have 3 more forts than there are Indian villages. The Indians achieve theirs if there are more villages than forts.
In the final Winter Quarters, the victory conditions are determined by the same variables, so though the numbers are different, the logic remains the same.
(Total) Support and (total) Opposition are common to all victory conditions. So how is Support or Opposition changed?
There are four ways. 
1. The British can Muster, which costs one resource, and then shift support by one level per additional resource spent.  
2. The Patriots can spend 1 resource to Rabble-rouse and simultaneously shift opposition by one level. 
While the Patriots are limited to shifting opposition by one level per turn by this means, the British can shift support more than one level provided they have the resources to spend. While changing support is more expensive than changing opposition (it takes 2 resources to change support one level, or 3 to change it two, given the resources the British can change support more rapidly than the Patriots can change opposition. 
3. A battle won by sufficiently large margin can cause a shift towards either Support or Opposition. At the same time, if the Patriots are the winners, they gain a free Rally and permit the French to shift a blockade. If Washington is present at the battle, not only are the Patriots favoured in the battle itself, but should they win by a large enough margin, the shift towards Opposition is doubled. 
4. During the Winter Quarters round, both British and Patriots may pay to alter the balance. Each earlier Indian Raid cost both British and Patriots one resource to remove before any change in Support or Opposition can be bought, but the British are also penalised resources by any Patriot propaganda. 
Thus the rules favour the Patriots over the British in each way that Support and Opposition can be changed – except for the possibility open to the British to buy support. This possibility is only real if resources are sufficiently available. The French and Indian player can do little to change support and opposition.
The second victory condition requires the British to fight and beat the Patriots repeatedly. The Patriots just have to destroy Indian villages. The French control their second victory condition by attacking the British repeatedly, and to encourage the Patriots to attack and beat the British again and again. The Indians, meanwhile, just have to keep rebuilding villages.
The economics are determined in the Resources Phase of the Winter Quarters round. Resources depend on the possession of different things for the four factions:
British: Number of forts, Population of cities not blockaded, Control of W Indies
Patriots: Number of forts, Rebellion controlled spaces
French: FNI level, Population of cities not British, Control of W Indies
Indians: Number of villages
The only way for the British player to build forts (which they need to gain resources) is to reduce military strength during their turns. There is no way for the British player to lift blockades (and although one blockade is lifted during the Winter Quarters, the rules de facto leave to the French player the choice of which one to lift).  Blockade also eliminates the Support of that city, thus reducing the likelihood of victory. Control of the West Indies, hugely valuable in terms of resources gained each year, is made more difficult for the British player than the French by a penalty on the British if they are defending. These considerations mean that the British player is constrained to try to build forts, without which the lack of resources will be paralytic. In other words, to stay alive in the game, the British player must reduce his capacity to win battles. Winning battles is one of the British victory conditions – you can’t increase the gap between British and Patriot casualties if you don’t win battles.
The Patriots don’t have to build forts, though they could – they can instead destroy villages and conquer territory. Building military strength helps both these aims. So the economics of the game provides positive feedback for the Patriots. 
The French benefit by blockade since it increases FNI, and this Faction has an advantage in the struggle for control for the West Indies. It has some interest in reducing the British control of cities, but the rules do not cause it to be conflicted in any way by the game’s economic engine. 
The Indians are on a hiding to nothing. They need to convert their fighting strength to villages, but the Patriots win by destroying their villages. So weakening their capacity to defend themselves is the only possible way for the Indians to win, and a sure-fire way to lose.
From these considerations alone it looks as if the Patriots are almost gifted a win.
It must be said, however, that I would not want to draw a process diagram of this game. The rules are hugely convoluted and intricate, with a complex set of relationships and feedback between resources, forces, forts, villages, raids, propaganda, FNI, populations, blockades, and the processes of Garrison, Muster, March, Rally, Rabble-rousing, and their various links with the all-important Support and Opposition. The rules consist of 22 pages in 10-point font, with an additional 9 pages of solo rules (I bought it to play solo), 3 pages of lexicon, and 25 pages of tutorial. 

The designer, Harold Buchanan, was gracious enough to spend more than an hour on Skype discussing the game with me and pointing out its more nuanced aspects. But despite that generous investment of his time, I have still perhaps misunderstood the rules and the game is balanced in some way that I have missed; I can't get the British anywhere near a victory. The game may be historically correct in that - though I think the war was lost in London, not in the Colonies - but for me a game should be winnable by both sides for it to remain interesting.

One final point concerns the choice of the fourth Faction. It is unclear to me what the Indians are doing in this game. Their role in the historic war was marginal. What was much more important was the role of the Loyalists. Given that the war was largely a civil war between Patriots and Loyalists ("Tory" was pejorative) I don't understand why the Loyalists aren't a Faction instead.

This is a really really really tough game to get the hang of if it is your first time playing a COIN game...  I had tried to play A Distant Plain solo in the past and ended up trading it away.  It was that it was a poor game, I think that A Distant Plain was probably an excellent game, but the depth and complexity of teaching myself to play it solo was overwhelming.  About 6 months later, I picked up this game because I wanted to give COIN another shot and I liked the theme of this one more.

I have studied this game.... intensely.  And after about 2 weeks of solo play filled with forum posting and page flipping, I am getting the hang of not just the rules, but of the Solo non-player AI rules.

It is really an outstanding experience once you figure it out, unlike anything you will find outside of another COIN title.  That said, you need to be looking for a game that needs to be learned.  This is not a sit down for a night, teach some other players, let's go game.  This is a game you study, a process you improve over time, an experience that gets better and better the more effort you give it.

A whole lot to like about this game.  Really like historical games. Especially this time period.  The board is excellent. Best of any game I've owned.  As for COIN mechanics. Just really like how they work. But in the end something doesn't connect. It's where historical game meets euro.  I love both.  But you just don't really win. You just do better at achieving objectives. In a euro, I'm fine with scoring the most points. But not in a historical conflict. I actually think I would have really liked this game with a group that was willing to do multiple plays and get thru the learning curve. I think it might even work best as a two player game the way the objectives work. Then you either win the revolution or squelch it. Anyway - it was not easy, but I sold this game. Good-bye LoD. I know if I ever meet someone who's into games about the American Revolution I still have 1775 and Washington's War.

COIN to the War of Independence!  COIN system is great for club gaming, which can grabs the attention of four at the same time while the game can be completed in just an afternoon.  The abstractions at strategic level are somewhat too much to my taste but the historical narrative of the game is rich.  You can always learn something from the system about the strategic development of the war in subject.  I have many games of the COIN and it sounds like a bit wear-off now.  So I delay the purchase of this game and the other new one on American Revolution.  However, I am sure I will get them someday because you just can't afford to loose them in your complete COIN collection, can you?

Great Euro-style strategy game.  Great components and AI system that allows you to play alone or with others and have some factions controlled by the "computer".  This is a very high-level strategy treatment of the American Revolution.

The only reason why I don't play this more is because of the complexity in running the AI bots.  Running the British as a bot, for example, is incredibly painful and tedious.

I have played this 3 times solo (playing all the factions) and once as a two player with someone fairly new to COIN games. Every play has been a wonderful experience and with every game my fascination with the COIN series created by Volko Ruhnke increases. This game was designed by Harold Buchanan and he has done a fantastic job with it.

Firstly the artwork is outstanding (Artwork credited to Charles Kibler, Terry Leeds, Rodger B. MacGowan, and Howard Pyle) and really brings the game to life. The map board is one of the best I have seen.

Components are what you would expect from a coin game, great thematic artwork on the cards driving the play, good embossed wooden pieces and what Liberty or Death brings new to the COIN system (amongst other things!) leaders, which you can either use cardboard standees or tokens. I was initially unimpressed with the idea of cardboard standees but in this game they have won me over. They stand out from the map and the multitude of cubes and cylinders, drawing your eye to the fact there is a leader there.

But all of this is on the surface, fortunately it is also in the gameplay that the game shines. As with other coin games you have to accept the slightly abstracted representation of events and factions (but how else are they going to be represented in a board game), but it works so wonderfully well that you really become absorbed in the to and fro'ing of political control and feet on the ground (and ships and blockades)!

I do feel this is slightly easier to get into than Fire In the Lake but it is no less of a good game for it. The four factions play slightly more differently to other COIN games I have played (CUBA Libre and Fire In The Lake) and as such I feel there is probably slightly more breadth of play in this game, in terms of the differing experience in the four factions.

I was initially concerned that the 4 different winning conditions were two similar on the two opposing sides. I thought that the Patriots / French and British / Indians were too aligned in there winning conditions. But in my plays I have realised this concern was unfounded. Just like the other COIN games this leads to wonderful gameplay as you work together (well not too much together you don't want to help your allied faction too much!) all the while planning and looking for the opportune moment to act on your own interests and create that political, military, ideological differentiation between you that allows you to gain the upper hand turning the board state to your advantage.

As I said I have only played this solo / two player and am really looking forward to trying it with 4 players. I feel at this number the game will really shine as the differences between the allied factions will become more transparent and game play will be all the more richer for it.

UPDATE

Ok I will start of by saying this is a great game. It's not my favourite coin game, that is always the last one I played and at the moment this is Cuba Libra, but next time I play Liberty or Death it will be my favourite coin game again.

We have played it a couple of times at 4 player and both times had a new player to the game. Everyone has enjoyed it and it has provoked a good discussion as to its merits afterwards. One thing that came out of these discussions is that next time we play we want to try the medium scenario. I have played the sprint scenario solo a few times and 4 player a few times (just had a look ... 6 plays in total) and every time the Patriots or French have won. I understand this could just be group think but we are at the point where we want to devote a bit more time to it and give a medium scenario a go (devoting time is more difficult than you think when we are all busy. Kids hey, who would have them!).

Has any one managed a win with the Brits or Indians in the short game? I would be interested to know. What length of game do you recommend?

At first I was a bit sceptical about the battle mechanic but it works wonderfully and after your first couple of battles the modifiers are very easy to understand. We have found that battles are not as common as you may imagine and the Brits ability to garrison is great for kicking Patriots out a city if they gather too much in one spot.

Really a great game and it is good to see the coin system garner a lot of attention on the back of this.

This adds some new concepts to the COIN series and adapts others to suit the theme. Although the theme may at first appear unsuitable for a COIN, it actually works extremely well, since the American Revolution was largely two-sided with two factions on each side that had very different motives. In particular, Liberty or Death adds innovative two-dimensional victory conditions, bolstered by an exciting battle system to simulate the more conventional warfare style of the time and leaders with varying abilities.

After a solo play of the C3i scenario, I'm excited for more.  It's really not that complicated; the hard part of this game is in how to win, not how to play.  Supposedly the COIN with the most exceptions, so I guess that's good for if I want to play the other games in the series.

A lot of intrigue for many GMT games and getting them played in 2016, but all sessions were underwhelming (fell flat). Games not complicated per se, we feel they are unnecessarily cumbersome; perhaps inefficient outdated mechanics? Not getting enough enjoyment or memorable moments out of the games for the effort put in. Requires extensive rules reading and explaining each session unless played quite frequently (really needs dedicated game group). Even with a dedicated group, I can still see these games overstaying their welcome playtime (even with the short campaigns). Great themes and components for all GMT games, top quality in that department. Perhaps I'm not a war gamer anymore?

COIN isn't aimed at simulation but at plausible narrative within the framework of period history, and LoD is a beautiful realization of that.  And it really is a narrative experience:  the cards, the map, the mechanics, and the asymmetrical commands and activities available to each faction drive a complex story.  The pleasure is in seeing that story unfold.

This is what it has felt like playing the game with my sons, both of whom are interested in the period.  Exploring how the real events happened and how their occurrence might be different in our game's alternate history has been a real joy.

Solid entry into the COIN line of games with a stunning production. Plus, the theme is one of my favorites. This has the potential to be my favorite COIN game but the battle mechanics are a little cumbersome, victory conditions can be a little wonky sometimes, and one side usually just runs away with it after a bit - scores have not been close in my experience. Despite that, it is a solid game and the bot AI works really well. It is fun to play solo.

The British do have a difficult task - spread out and it cost them more to keep the army going or concentrate and they are not building support. The Patriots have a fragile force that is constantly waxing and waning. Nice capture of the issues both sides faced. 

The map is terrific and the components top notch. Player aids were great. Not sold on the rulebook, I found lot of the phrasing awkward. I had a lot of huh, what is meant here moments. Definitely need to dig though the faq's and living rules for clarification.

Did an admirable job shoehorning 4 factions into the game, the victory conditions work well. but I wonder if still would be better as 2 player game like Colonial Twilight and use the French and Indians as bots.
 
May go up on later plays.

abysmal rules. are the French really incapable of attacking Indians? if a leader card is trumped by a different leader card, what EXATLY happens, what order does it happen in and what DOESNT happen?? (ie, an event is chosen by player A, palyer B trumps with leader card can player  A play their leader to cancel player B? or is player A 'inelgible'? WHAT??

My strong appreciation for Liberty or Death may be biased from the fact that it is one of my first 2 COIN games. Regardless, Liberty or Death does an outstanding job of presenting a narrative which drives both the decisions and the outcome of the game. The historical arguments in the game provide an interesting mental exploration space, the challenges and player options are significant, and the depth embedded in the system is compelling enough to hold for large replayability. I have thoroughly enjoyed this at player counts of 1, 2 and 4 (3 untested). 

There are some issues with balancing the implicitly imbalanced asymmetric axes, but nothing that disturbs the game at all. This is one of those games whose 'journey' is so compelling that its conclusion is relatively unimportant. 

Finally, the production quality of this game is tremendous and significantly adds to the pleasure of playing.

Excellent introduction into the COIN series. Highly thematic, with the campaigns and events allowing you to relive (and rewrite!) history. Asymmetric factions and victory conditions leads to different obstacles and opportunities with each gameplay. Bots are easy to pick up once you understand the basic flow of gameplay. I taught myself basic strategy and how the bots work by playing a full-length game with only bots. After the game, the rules were quite clear, and the bot mechanic flowed nicely.

Overall a great addition to the COIN series. Easier to refresh on the rules after some time away from the game than, say, FitL, and easier to teach also. Excellent attention to detail throughout all aspects of the game.

Some points off for several reasons. I find the victory conditions to be too similar between the factions (I prefer the asymmetrical victory conditions of previous COIN games) and a bit unbalanced (British casualties seem far easier to generate than Rebellion casualties). At times I find I have to make "gamey" moves like deliberately expose Patriot forts as the French or deliberately March to a space where I'll take casualties as the Patriots that wouldn't happen in real life.

That said, I've played the game a bunch since it was released and enjoy it immensely.

[1 play] I don’t think I’m the target market for the COIN games.

Long to teach rules. Long to play. Would move quicker with subsequent plays, but will always be long.

The question I always ask myself is does the experience provide enjoyment in a sufficient ratio to the time and energy invested. So far with the COIN games, I find myself in the minority among my friends because I question these GMT games in that regard. I also believe that my tolerance for very long multiplayer wargames has been steadily shrinking over time.

Probably too quick to judge, but I also question the balance of Liberty or Death. The Indians were nearly irrelevant to the history of the Revolutionary War, so while the game accurately makes them the weakest faction, it also didn’t need to have them at all, except to sell the game as 4 player compatible. The French were in too early and too powerful, but that could just be our experience in this particular playing.

The added levels of complexity didn’t give me a greater connection to the history. So why are they there? Others may enjoy them, for me the reward isn’t there. CRTs are a step backward and an indication of an incompletely crafted modern game. 

I would rather play Washington’s War or Liberty to simulate the Revolutionary War, and I would rather play a couple of meaty eurogames with a group than a long multiplayer wargame.

This review could mellow with distance, but for now I’m accurately documenting my feelings the next day.

Most recent play Nov ‘17.

I'm still discovering the nuances of this game (my first COIN). The mechanics are brilliant and I appreciate the scope of historical research that went into its theming. (My family is going trough an American Revolution kick w/ the Hamilton musical.)
 
That it can be enjoyed multi-player solitaire with asymmetric player goals and mechanics is a massive plus. 

The deep theme implementation and asymmetry reminds me of a slightly abstracted War of the Ring. But surprisingly, with even weightier decision-making, LoD's game-play is somehow smoother. It plays easier and tighter, yet gives a similar satisfaction of an engrossing epic. 

Combine all of that with its fine artwork, overall art direction, player-aides, and components and this might make my collection's MOAB (Mother of All Board-games).

This is at the pinnacle of grand-strategic wargame design. If all of the above holds up over repeated plays, this might be my first 10.

My first real COIN game I have played.  The game is flavorful and its ability to adapt COIN to an older time period is interesting.  The battle system is a little funky but overall alright.  The game is fundamentally flawed in how it portrays the French and victory conditions.  Would maybe have been better as a 3 player game: Patriots, Indians, and British with the French involvement being Patriot capabilities via card play.

My first COIN acquisition. I chose it as my introduction COIN because of the theme and I was eager to get into the system with one on the heavier side. It's a beautiful system and a marvelous game. All COINs feel unique even though the base mechanics are the same and each title teaches a concise history lesson.

The worst COIN game so far.  That's not to say I won't play it, but I won't offer it up when there are so many better COINs to choose from.  It suffers from wonky victory coniditions and I find the Indian faction to be completely ahistorical in every way.  I understand breaking from history to make a game a game, but I feel as if the Indians were added in there just to make a fourth faction and there's no real rhyme or reason for their existence.

Enjoyable enough, perhaps an odd fit for COIN... French take a while to "gear up", but the factions do all seem to work fairly well.  As always, I enjoy the table talk & banter between factions and "allies".  Solitaires very well, even without using the bots.

RATING: 5
The French and Indians can't fight. This is a serious problem in COIN. The Indians are an inferior COIN partner for the Brits, leaving the Brits open to a double team from the French and Patriots.  No incentive for the Brits to do the heavy lifting, as they would just be delivering victory to the Indians.  Die rolling and modifiers are arcane.  My least favorite COIN.

RATING: 8
Thematically, my favorite COIN game so far, and very nicely done.  I've only played solo so far but I've enjoyed every game and like other COIN titles it feels tense and precarious throughout, yet never so much that player agency feels missing.

My only issue at this point is the victory conditions and what they represent.  As I've focused primarily on the Patriot faction so far, I keep running into an issue in which early military successes drive up the British casualties without costing me too many units in return.  As such, once the French arrive, they're well on their way to victory and I find myself sometimes contemplating near-suicidal actions just to bring the cumulative rebellion casualties up.  Which feels odd.  I suppose what I need to do early on is show a little more restraint, but when I get an opportunity to do some damage, especially with Washington and his "double Win the Day" ability, it feels weird not to take it.  I suppose a lot of the cognitive dissonance here comes from not knowing the history.  I always thought the Founding Fathers were out to win their independence and weren't terribly concerned about upsetting the balance of powers in Europe, but that's definitely a consideration here.

Highly anticipated COIN title covering an all time favorite historical conflict.  Did not disappoint, some good innovations of the COIN model (randomness in battles, simplified LoC, leaders, etc).

The COIN system works beautifully in the American Insurrection and has its own, unique twists. I agree with the designer's words. This is NOT a four player COIN system shoehorned into a two-sided conflict. The OTHER games on the subject force a multi-sided conflict into a two-sided game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Faction choices are strange. France was allied with the Americans. The Indians were a collection of antagonistic tribes. Tories, Militia, British and Continentals makes more sense to me. The conflict was at least as much a conventional military affair as it was a "counter-insurgency". So the whole premise for this game is, for me, untenable and I fear this is a harbinger of things to come from GMT in this series. Rather play 1776. Or Skirmish. Or 1775. or Washington's War. Great artwork, though.

But, I never liked COIN to start with because of the un-resolved problems of playing king of the hill, bash the leader, and kingmaking inherent to multiplayer conflict games. If a new design does not at least try to address these problems, I see little point in playing it because these problems will ultimately overwhelm whatever other merits the design may have. Your milage may vary.

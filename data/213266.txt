Another fun little wallet game, each round ends up with such different towns based on the objectives. Scoring is a little bit of a pain in the ass, though, lots of numbers to add up for such an otherwise compacted experience.

RATING: 5
This is fine, but nothing special.  The gameplay itself is entertaining enough, though with fairly limited options, but the way the game plays, you're likely to spend as much time counting points each round as actually playing.

Interesting microgame of creating contiguous areas while achieving special objectives. Not a game to binge on, but a good one to wind down with. One of the better Button Shy wallet games.

RATING: 6
Play this game mostly solo, and the different AIs have some good difficulty to them where you have to modify your strategy in order to beat them.  However I do have to dock a point from this game for being very much dependent on luck of the draw.

Tiny little rondel game. I like it enough, though it lasts only a few minutes and it's often hard to see other players' tableaux. I still like how it captures the feeling of some larger area/set collection games in a short period of time. 

Unfortunately, I really dislike Button Shy's Patreon subscription system and their customer service overall, so I won't be getting any of the little expansions to this, which is too bad because I think this game could use a little extra content.

Very fun 18 card drafting game for 2. Plays fast (10 minutes) and different every time. Study the objectives....pick your card, place your card, rinse and repeat til cards are gone...score. Well done.

Excellent micro-game.... a ton of game in 18 cards.

RATING: 8
This game was surprisingly good!  Usually these micro-games are exercises in "look how we can technically make a game with only a few components!" where the gameplay is basic, shallow, and repetitive.  Circle the Wagons, however, manages to pack a really interesting and strategic drafting game into 18 cards.  The ingenious thing, of course, is the variable scoring conditions on the backs of the cards.  With 3 cards per game, that's 816 different games!  The scoring conditions radically change the value of cards, plus there's still the static demand for large territories, leading to interesting decisions about what to draft, what to skip, and where to place things.  All in less than 10 minutes!

Each player in Circle the Wagons is fixin' to build up their own boomtown, but only one'll build the best in the West!

Blaze a trail by draftin' cards 'round the circle and placin' 'em in yer town, tryin' to connect matchin' territories to score prosperity points! But don't forget about them three bonus cards in the center of the circle that can score ya even more points — that is, if ya play yer cards right. With darn near five thousand unique ways to score and millions of draftin' and placin' combos, you'll never build the same town twice!

Small, but clever little game. A lot of fun from 18 cards. You can bring it anywhere. Played just PnP, but for this mechanic production is not of prime importance.
Thumbs up!

KS backer.  This goes with me everywhere (along with my other ButtonShy wallet games, natch). Solo play is well done, although mechanics/victory conditions are different enough that I can't use solo to learn to win against human opponents. I'm happy to play this any chance I get.

This is a really nifty microgame that seems very simple on the surface but has some great decisions in it. It plays quickly, and is easy to learn, but with some nice depth to it and lots of replay value.

In general, though, I've kind of stepped away from the microgame thing. They tend to be short, and short games just don't get played with my group. And I am overflowing with two player games, so I really don't need more of those. If you're not in this situation, it's worth checking out.

Simple to learn, fast gameplay, and variable setup make this an instant classic game to take on the go! The only (extremely minor) caveat is the sort-of large footprint the game has on some tables. But other than that, it’s an AMAZING game.

I enjoy this little game. Quite a bit of thinking involved for just 18 cards. I suggest starting using just one of the scoring conditions in addition to the territory scoring then adding a 2nd then 3rd when you get used to it. Perfect for travel but takes up a surprising amount of table space for it's small size.

2 player wallet sized game. Not many cards at all in this and all double sided but mostly using the grid of icons side. You are overlaying the cards to form a field of cards to try and accommodate the end victory conditions and bonus points. Simple and enjoyable. Lots of replay here and fast 2p game. great micro game.

This micro game seems like it is right in my wheelhouse. I like the way the cards are added to your area. The way you are going for the various bonuses that change from game to game to make a ton of different combinations. That will make every game play differently. I am a big fan of these super short filler games that have some actual choices and decisions. It doesn't hurt to have glowing endorsements from TheOneTAR and Nettersplays. This game is a MUST for people that play on the go. I need to mention the fabulous customer service I received from Button Shy. There was an honest mistake with the items sent and they were polite, responded timely, and are correcting it quickly. They even allowed me to keep the solo expansion that was shipped by accident. I've even already played using it, and it's REALLY good! I'm actually super happy to have it.

Circle the Wagons is a lot of game in just 18 cards. There are thousands of different scoring combinations possible. Think Love Letter on steroids! Two players build their own Wild West boomtown. Players take turns drafting cards from a circle, either taking the active card, or any other card in the circle, but if they draft out of order they have to give any skipped cards to the other player. The largest contiguous area for each terrain type scores in your boomtown, as well as the three unique and very fun bonus scoring conditions that are dealt into the middle of the card circle at  game onset. You might want the largest cow herd, the most or least mines, guns between two deserts or whiskey near your wagons to avoid losing points. It is very fun, plays quickly, is highly variable and ultra portable. There's even a solo play option available from Button Shy. Plus it's great to support a small company doing something pretty unique in our industry! I highly recommend this wallet game.

Really impressed. This is much better game than Patchwork, which uses a similar selection mechanic.

Have only played once, but I'm not sure how the replayability would hold up. It feels like scores will always be close and you always just try to maximize your score with the cards you get while hoping to end up with more points than your opponent.

Whether that holds true or not, this seems like it will be a fun enough game to break out from time to time.

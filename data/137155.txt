Trick taker with asymmetrical suits and one of those low card (Potato Man!) beats high card (Evil Potatohead) things. Hands can end unexpectedly when a player is unable to play a card of the correct colour. It works but there is nothing particularly engaging here, not even girly green potatoes in hula skirts.

Played it two players and it is the best trick taking game I have ever played with 2.  In trick taking games you do not usually draw a card after you play so that took a bit to remember but the ability and requirement to play 2 suits a trick each makes for a strategic game.  The different scoring for which colour wins the suit works very well.  Looking forwards to playing this with 3 and 4.

RATING: 7.5
Really fun trick taking game with a few twists, the biggest of which being is you must play a suit that has NOT YET been played instead of following suit. The variable trump of potato man against evil potatoes is also a nice mechanical touch. Easy to teach and play, but with some strategy to consider. Solid.

Initial Impressions
-----------------------

Really neat take on trick taking, as you have to play a DIFFERENT color (rather than the same).  The 6 cards having special meaning (Potato man vs the villains) also added just enough to add a little flavor.  Probably a little chaotic, but for as short as it is, I found it to be a ton of fun.  I also felt like I had enough control to make my choices of what card to play interesting.  There is also that push your luck element, because you never know when a round might end because someone didn't have a specific color that needed to be played.  Fun game, looking forward to many more plays.

Lasting Impressions
-----------------------
5p for this game has been really fun.  The game was not so good with 3p.  I think if you are looking for something to play with 2-3p, I would go somewhere else.  This game TRUELY has a sweet spot at 4-5 players.

Asymmetric trick taking game - where you have to not follow suit and one low suit (potato man) has potential to beat the highest (evil potato man). Theme is daft and mechanics bear no resemblance to theme, this is just a trick taking card game with a twist.

Problem for me is the twist is sadly lacking, not at all twisty - and with an odd distribution the round could end very quickly.

Overall, totally underwhelmed, if I want a tricksy trick taking game I'll play Spooks or Die Sieben Siegel (Zing!)

Would play it again, as it's pretty harmless.

I like trick takers, and this has enough of a twist on it to make it fun!

The basic mechanic is that there are 4 suits, and each trick, you cannot play a suit that has already been played.  The trick winner is simply the player that has played the highest card.

Each suit has numbers in a different range, and the number of points you score depends on the suit you won the trick with.  Winning with the most powerful (highest numbered) suit gets you 1 point, while winning with the weakest suit gets you 4.

Additionally, the highest cards in the entire game are "villain" potatoes, and may be beat by Potato Man (the lowest cards in the game), adding a little wrinkle to the game.

Overall, just a fun, light trick taking game that I'll add to my trick taking rotation!

I adore trick taking games, and I love the little rules quirks that take such a simple system and elevate it into a really interesting game. It's also great fun to watch people who don't love trick-takers as much as me start out thinking there is no strategy, control or decision-making to realising that once you work out how to play all of those things are very evident.

This time it's the not-following-suit aspect that's the twist and it works very well, at least with 4 and 5. I'm excited that it apparently works great with 2, too.

Trick takers always work well with my husband, so these tend to see some table time at our house.  We enjoyed this one with the kids.  Never knowing when the round will end keeps things interesting - do I save my big scorers for later or use them before the round ends and I can't?

Very light trick-taking game where players have to play a different color (suit) than what is already in the trick.  Tricks are worth different points depending on which suit wins the trick.  There's some push-your-luck as you try to hold out for the gold sacks, hoping the hand won't end before you can get some (it usually does).   Very simple game, almost anybody can play, very approachable.

Another Trick taking game? Surely we have seen it all before. But no, Potato Man offers another twist. This time you can't follow any suit that has been played. And the lowest card in the rarest suit beats the highest card in the most common suit. Those two little twists make this a really interesting game, especially with 4 players. Another group played 5 and didn't recommend it. But with 4 it is a great 20 minute filler.

RATING: 5
The most fun part of this game is embellishing the theme by constantly saying "potato" and "potato man" in a variety of voices. The theme is just funny, but the game itself just simply exists.  The decisions for the most part are straightforward and automatic, so much of it just comes down to the deal. The gameplay is simple and could fill the role when you want a game as an excuse for something to occupy yourselves with while you visit with friends.

Potato Man is a fun, light trick taker which works well for 2 players or more.  The variable scoring tricks, the Super Potato card and the end game trigger of not being able to play all make this one a cut above other similar games.

RATING: 5
Potato Man is a trick-taking game. There are 4 twists to this one:

1) Player's are not allowed to follow suit. In a 2 and 4-player game, each colour must be played exactly once, or...

2) If a player can't play into a trick, the round immediately ends. Regardless of how many cards are in left in each player's hands.

3) The highest number beats the lowest number... except if one of the 3 highest cards are played and one of the 3 lowest cards are played. In that case, the player who played the lowest card wins.

4) When a player wins a trick, the winner takes a point card that has the same colour as their winning card. If there are none left in that colour, you take from a different pile.

It wasn't fussy on the game. That said, I only played this with two people. Though, I've heard it plays well this way. Four is probably optimal. I think my dislike comes down to the instant ending of a round when someone can't play into a trick. It doesn't really matter because at four I would rather play Sticheln, or some other quick card game.

Potato Man is my second favorite trick-taker (my favorite will be in the next post in the series) going right now. I love the asymmetric suits, suit follow rule, and scoring. This is yet another game that I could play for hours at a time in a perfect world.

My current favorite of the custom trick-taking genre.  This can be played with a standard deck, but I like potatoes.

RATING: 7
Potato man is an excellent trick-taking game with a unique twist.  You can't follow suit, but the highest number (or later if two of the same number are played) wins the trick.   The suits have varying ranges so it's easier to win a trick with some suits but the rewards for winning a trick with the lower ranged suits are higher.  Round ends when someone can't follow suit.   Lots of potential for good tactical play here and it works well with 2 as well.

RATING: 8
An amusingly-illustrated trick-taking game, Potato Man provides a few twists on typical games of this ilk. It all adds up to a really different experience with a surprising amount of tension. 

Unlike in a normal trick-taking game, players are forbidden to follow suit. In fact, they cannot play a suit that has already been played. This makes it very difficult to pull a suit from other players. Additionally, if a player has no legal play on his/her turn, the round immediately ends. This means that short-suiting should really only be done if you are in the lead on the round as it hastens the ending. 

Additionally, each suit has slightly different values of cards. The highest card in a trick wins, regardless of color, but the color with the highest cards also scores the fewest points per trick. The color of the card that wins the trick determines how many points (from 1-4) it will be worth. However, after 3 wins for a single color, all subsequent wins in that color are worth 5 points. Fear not, this scoring is very easy to track with the included scoring cards.

Finally, the three highest cards in the game (all part of the red suit) are always beaten by the three lowest cards in the game (all part of the yellow suit). These relatively simple and easy-to-grasp twists make it very difficult to evaluate both the value of a card as well as the proper time to play it. There almost seems to be an element of push-your-luck, since the round can end abruptly (stranding powerful cards in your hand), yet the later tricks are often worth the most points. This is a dynamic that I have not seen in a trick-taking game before, and it really worked for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So simple, so fun. Its a super-accessible tricky trick player that still has meaningful plays. Potato Man achieves it simple but interesting structure by having unevenly valued suits (and inversely valuable trick winnings; winning with the "worse" suits give you more points) and restricting the play such that each suit can only be played once. Furthermore, if you hold out, the 4th+ trick won with a particular suit grants you five points (versus the 1-4 earlier in the game) but the game ends immediately when a player can *not* play. This creates delicious tension around how long to hold out on your best cards -- hold out too long and you won't play them at all! Also the 3 worst valued cards (i.e., the Potato Man!) beats the 3 highest (i.e., the evil Potato Peeler!). Just the right amount of simple, meaningful, and interesting twists to make this a winner: and it works with 2. 

Also, the wacky theme just pulls it together nicely.

EDIT: September 2017
-----------------------------
So I've finally played the game with 4. It's neat how much faster you can make a hand end through short suiting, but gone is the control of the two player game. No more Potato-Pin. Plays are more about either taking the trick or playing in ways to push players into taking tricks of lesser value or emptying out potato bags of colours you're about to have in your wheelhouse. I'm not sure if I prefer it to playing with two, but it's cool how differing player counts produce such different experiences!

Simplistic, but there is still decision making and tactics involved with selecting which cards to double up on (when playing with 5) - so that you can control what cards you still have in hand and which ones others might run out of

Does that mean it's good? Not exactly. It's mediocre, it's ok for what it is.

A really interesting trick-taking game with a totally bizarre theme but great mechanics.  Very simple to teach and with some tough decisions to make, a great pocket sized game to fill in the gaps.

One warning though, this game is not good with 3 players even if you remove one of the colours.  We found that the rounds almost always lasted until the cards had run out or there were only one left in each player's hand.  This isn't really how this game should play and it wasn't much fun.

A great new take on trick taking games.  I love that the players are limited to colors which have not yet been played.  I also like that as the game goes along and trick scoring cards are taken, it opens up the "wild" cards for even more points.  Awesome little card game that is a lot of fun and plays fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There is a bunch of surprising subtlety in this design that manages to set this game apart, but to not be so weird as to alienate most casual gamers. First the easy stuff. In a trick, all colors played (there are 4) must be different (except in a five player game where one color can be duplicated once). High card wins, regardless of color, with ties going to cards played later. While no color is superior for trick-taking, colors have slightly different ranges, with the highest cards belonging to red then blue, green and yellow in that order. When you win a trick, you don't take the cards, but you take sacks of potatoes that match the winning color - the value of which is in there reverse order - red is worth one, blue two, green three and yellow four. There are three scoring cards in each color. If you need to draw from a depleted color, you get to take from a "golden" pile with 5 potatoes. Every player deals once then the game ends. Whomever has the most potatoes wins.

The real standout mechanic in the game is that if you cannot legally play a card (because of the color restriction) the round immediately ends and no more points are awarded. If you are dealt a crappy hand, your primary goal is going to be to prematurely end the round by voiding yourself in a color. This creates a dynamic like no other trick taker I've tried. If you have a great hand, you may need to leverage it quickly and get points before its over. Having great cards is no certainty. This gives everyone a stake in the jockeying for position and points no matter what your cards.

Trick-taking games that scale with different player counts are rare. Potato Man does this well, which means it goes with me to a lot of gaming events. It plays well at every player count, though I think I like it best with 2 or with 4. It's easy to teach, unlike some trick-taking games, and the title grabs people's attention. If you like trick-taking games this is a good one. I would probably give this only a 7 but the ability to play with 2-5 gives it a bump up.

This is a fun filler with a few twists to the trick taking genre.  Each person must play a card of a different color and the highest value card takes the trick, taking the associated sack(s) of the card used to win the trick.  Suits have different ranges much like Foppen but the shortest suited color has three potato mans which can beat the three highest reds (more cards in suit and highest value cards).  Another interesting aspect is that once a color has three suits won in its color, the next time that color is used to win a trick you get a special 5 sack card!

If someone cannot play a different color the current round is over.

Straightforward trick taking game with a few little twists.  A very tactical 2 player game, but also very enjoyable with 4 players, even if you have a bit less control.  You need to play to your hand's strength to gain the most sacks of potatoes and keep in mind the different distribution of numbers for each color.  Since you don't follow suit, it really opens up your options on what you can play each turn.

RATING: 8
If you have kids and like playing card games with them, go out and get this now. It has been a huge hit in our family. Probably more popular than linko but we have played that more this year as it is the newer game.

It is a trick taking game where you are attempting to win tricks by playing the highest coloured potato card to win sacks with (depending on the colour) a varying amount of spuds in. These sacks of spuds are the scoring points in the game. Each of the four colours are asymmetrical in terms of the distribution of numbers in their suit and the points they give for winning with that colour. So it is easier to win with red for example, but you would get fewer points for doing so than say winning with yellow.

There are a few wrinkles with some spuds that have turned to the light and dark side and how they trump each other. It is much better than it sounds or obviously I wouldn't be praising it here. The trick is that you cannot play the same coloured potato card as previously played to the trick. There are special rules for 2 and 5 players and they all work well. 

I secretly like evil potato but that darn good yellow spud keeps making an appearance much to the glee of my kids and I hardly ever win!

A keeper to be played for years to come.

RATING: 6.5
Hard to tell if this is easier or more difficult than Euchre. Not following suit makes for interesting decisions, as well as a press-your-luck feel of keeping your good cards. The ending condition is unique and a player can definitely mitigate their hand to end hands quicker than expected.

The scoring mechanisms are cool as well. Based on your hand, you can either get a nice variety of score cards, focus on one to go right to the "State Fair Winners" (What I call the orange cards) or end the hand quickly to prevent others from scoring to milk a lead.

Do I like it more than Euchre? Hard to tell. It's shorter. It's less card counting. There's no reliance on your partner to carry you. And, maybe the most subtle difference than Euchre, you don't always feel in power when you lead a trick.

[i]This game fell flat for me, the decision space is not very interesting since there are too many instances when your choice is very limited and therefore quite apparent. There is some thought that goes into watching what other people play because the round immediately ends when someone can't play a card on a trick (I've experienced rounds where 2 tricks were played and then ended, not very satisfying).

I know that there is probably a bit more strategy to be uncovered with more plays, but your decisions will still be quite limited too often becuase of the structure of the game [i](way to many times when you have to play a color with no hope of winning the trick)[/i].

[i]I am not willing to put any more plays into a quick trick taking game that doesn't click right away since there are so many others to choose from [i](I much preferred the still very light, but much more fun [thing=151835][/thing] this month)[/i]. [/i]

Another trick taking game with little control but still fun to play (being a fan of trick taking I may be biased). There are different sets for each color but the colors with stronger cards are worth less and each trick can only contain one card of each color. So starting off is almost worthless, you want to be third or fourth to have some control or hope others make mistakes.

A good trick taking game.  The fact that you cannot follow suit adds a lot more to the strategic and tactical space than you would think from a cursory reading of the rules.  The point scoring system is also perfect for this game.  There are a lot of great "traditional" style card games out there.  Potato Man deserves to be mentioned with the best of them.

Different take on trick-taking. Can definitely suffer from the luck of the draw. Perhaps there is more strategy than meets the eye I am not sure. Unique in that there are 4 suits all with different value range and level of trump. It is also unique in that you must not follow suit. If you can not play a different colored card that's already been played then the round is over immediately. Bizarre but interesting. I can't say I was wowed but cute enough. Don't think I will play again.

The twist this time is that only one card of each suit can be played per round, and the suits are asymmetric. So far has worked equally well for 4 and 2, an impressive feat for any trick-taker.

One of the first casualties of having children is this: spontaneous sex. I'm not sure why. It could be that everyone is tired and as soon as you get horizontal, then zzzzzzzzzzzz. Or it could be that the Mother is "touched out" after having a newborn/toddler clawing at them all day. Or it's hormonal. Or everyone's mental focus is elsewhere. Or some other reason. But regardless: it vanishes, for a while at least. In its stead is this carefully planned, Project Management Sex where, days in advance, you pick a time to meet after the kid is in bed provided there's no housework to catch up on and you've showered and no dishes are in the sink and the toys are picked up and you can make time for each other for a little while as long as it's over by 10:15, or can it be over by 10 instead? because sleep is important. Brothers and sisters, the first year of a child's life is HARD. 

This is not permanent. It returns, and you welcome it. And it highlights for you just how important spontaneity is, in anything. Unplanned activity. Spur-of-the-moment whimsy. "Hey, you know what I'm in the mood for? Pizza." Or: "A trip to Belize." "Highland Park 18 Year." Or: "A game." And when you want to game spontaneously, you need a certain kind of game, one that does not kill the momentum. One with no real prolonged set up time. One with no fussy rules overhead that you need to refresh ("so let's just go over the nine phases and the three characters that modify them, and then we'll go over each of the four favor tracks"). No, you deal cards, and you play cards. That's how it's done. You're sitting on the couch, then you take your pants off. That's it. No middle step. No fumbling with the lock or closing the curtains. Just go. Idea leads to action, immediately. 

And Potato Man is perfect for that. It saved my marriage. There's no replacement for spontaneous sex, none, zero, zilch. But spontaneous gaming ends up being important during those dark times, because bad things happen when you lose contact with your spouse. 

This is a very simple game with light-hearted artwork. 4 suits of cards, and in each trick a suit (color) can only appear once. So the last player always knows what color they have to play, which is an important lever in the game. Colors are asymmetric, which adds to the hand management, because being short-suited in something isn't a big deal, in and of itself. For one thing, you can deliberately play those short-suited cards since the round ends when someone can't play to a trick. So if you're short-suited in one suit, chances are good you're long-suited in another. So ride that one, get an advantage, then kill the round while you're ahead and your opponent can't catch up. 

This is the best 2p trick taker I have played to date (excepting Haggis, which I treat as a climbing game), one that I have been able to share with my wife, and one we have been able to enjoy without any advance planning. Just a glance and a head motion. "Cards?" the head motion seems to say. And you're off. No rules explanation necessary, because it's a simple game, expressed simply and cleanly. Play it, and play it, and play it again. Enjoy that there's no time spent reminding one another how things work. Just play the game. And it feels like a traditional card game, which people intuitively understand how those work because they are familiar. And this is [i]un[/i]familiar in just enough ways to be compelling and memorable. Yes, it's four suits, but the suits are not differently-iconned versions of the same A-K run. One is 5-18, one is 1-13, one is 3-15, etc. That's different and makes things a little sideways-feeling.  

There is also a zero percent chance you scar your children because they walk in on you playing Potato Man.

RATING: 8
Sept 2017: Wow, much better than expected.

Lighter and less strategic than "traditional" trick taking games as it's much tougher to deduce what your opponents are holding. In fact, once your sure one of your opponents is void in a suit (because that opponent can't play in that suit) the round immediately ends.

I thought the mechanic of each card in a trick having to be a different suit would make it much harder to coerce opponents to play (or not play) certain cards. However, in Potato Man, the game itself coerces players to play or not play certain cards, which players must exploit to their advantage -- actually, Potato Man is a game more about timing than deducing what's in your opponents' hands.

For example, the highest cards in the deck can be beaten by the lowest, which prevents players holding those high cards winning tricks too easy.

The suits are uneven (for example, red cards range fro 5-18 but yellow ranges for 1-13) but winning a trick with a weak suit gives you much more points than winning one in a strong suit. So players have to be wary when playing high cards in weak suits.

BTW, by nature of this game (all cards of a trick must come from different suits), the game play is slower than your traditional trick taking game.

RATING: 6
This trick-taking game has several weird mechanics that fit together very well.  The uneven distribution of numbers between colors is the core, plus the requirement that players no duplicate colors.  The potato-man-versus-evil mechanic fits well, since the color with the lowest numbers has the potato men and the color with the highest numbers has evil cards.  Also, the 5-point golden sacks for exhausting a color's score pile make for interesting maneuvering as the round goes on, as does the round end condition of someone not having a legal play.  It all fits together to make for lots of neat decisions and devious traps.

That said, I'm a bit worried about how you cannot predict the end of a round or learn info about other players.  In a normal trick taking game, you get information about where cards are as players are unable to match suit.  Here, the moment someone cannot play, the round ends, so there is no inference of card distribution.  There are still interesting setups, but I suspect the game suffers in depth because there isn't an added layer of judging others' plays.

I'm a sucker for trick taking games but they have to do something interesting to set themselves apart. Potato Man is a rare example of a trick taker which not only works with only 2 players but is actually at its best that way! Different suits score differently with only 2 players you can manipulate your opponent's options cunningly. The theme is daft but the play is well worth a look for card game fans. It's also quick - it usually runs to about 15-20 minutes.

Tried this for kids gaming workshops and oops. Too damn hard (non-intuitive, lacks visceral excitement and laid-back-edness). 

3 player game with 3 suits seemed to play itself, so not recommending that. All in all it seemed like a lot of time you don't have much choice what to play (even when you lead, I'm not talking being the last player). So there are very few leverages which you must find and the overall impression is a very thinky one. 
It's one of those games where I must re-assess my gaming background in traditional card games - as in - Slovenian Tarock is a very particular game (kinda baroque, has some exciting twists and can be played in a laid back manner). 

I dunno, prefer climbing games to this as there's more of feeling of being engaged all the time.

Really fun take on trick-taking.  You must NOT follow suit which makes it hard to pull cards from an opponents hand.  Other twists are the 4 suits each have different values, Villian and SuperPotato cards, and the suits score variable amounts when taken.  Finally, the round ends when a player cannot make a legal play, which adds an incentive to rid yourself of a suit to end the game in your favor.  Seems to have the right balance of chaos and control. There is more here than first appears.  I recommend this as 4 or 5P.  Great fun.

Potato Man is a trick-taking game that works well 2p, a rare feat.  The key is that each player plays two cards per trick.  

There are several twists on the standard trick-taking formula: you can't play a suit that has already been played in the trick; the game consists of two rounds and a round ends whenever a player can't play a card, so it doesn't always pay to hold on to high cards until the end of the round; the highest card wins the trick unless it's a red-suited evil potato card followed by the titular yellow-suited potato man.  I can't help but exclaim "Potato Man!" whenever one of those cards is played.

Only one play so take with a pinch of salt. I could not see the game here 4 player. The round ended fairly quickly each time, despite my attempts to keep it going. I really like the idea of the game so will give it another shake - wonder whether 3 or 5 is better?

2 player very good. Control and a little legerdemain and Mr Potato Man causes fear in your opponent.

Rating is for 2 player. 

5p enjoyable as an end of evening knock about with Potato man impersonations obligatory when ever he steals a trick

After a few plays now think is a super game.

Do not be fooled by the silly name and artwork, for Trick-taking game players this is tight, clever and demands difficult decision-making. 

 Play to a score, not number of hands equal to players.  Playing to 25 works for a quick 4 player game which will probably have 4 to 6 hands played.  Play to 50 to smooth the card luck even further.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Clever, bizarrely-themed trick-taker, with the major novelty that each suit can only be played once in each trick. The winner of the trick scores points based on the suit they won with; the suits have different distributions and those with higher numbers are worth fewer points. Adding significant urgency to proceedings is that the round ends early if a player can't legally play a card, so holding on to high cards may not be a good strategy. A further frisson of danger comes from the Potato Man: the lowest three cards, artfully illustrated with the eponymous hero, trump the highest three.

Early impression is that it's not clear whether there is much or any control, but the constraints on play are unusual and without more experience it's difficult to tell if it's incompetence or just randomness. But for now it's a definite keeper.

RATING: 6.6
By now most people know my stance on trick taking games, but for clarity I'll repeat it here: I like the idea but most of them disappoint me for not being as brilliant as [thing=354][/thing].
OK, so this is not a pure trick taking game since you don't count points based on the cards in the tricks you win, you score points for cards you gain upon winning the trick. But you do all play 1 card and the highest card wins. The twist in this game is that all players must play a card in a different suit and that the values of the suits differ. Blue has higher values, but winning a trick with blue yields less points that winning with a yellow card. The biggest points however, are gained by winning a trick with a card for which no point cards are left: a whopping 5 points. Doing that twice almost guarantees winning the round.
I quite liked this one as it does offer nice choices about what cards to keep for later in the round when scoring big points might be easier. But there is always the risk of the round ending early when a player doesn't have a card of any suit that hasn't been played yet.

Initial score: 6.6

Potato Man is a wonderfully simple trick taking game where the better your card that you win the trick with, the fewer points it is worth. of course, being a Zoch game, it is completely nuts and is themed around potato superheroes.

And very fun it is too. 

I'm not sure how random it is, though one player seemed to do too well consistently for it to be completely random. And the theme is wonderfully charming.

Update: No, this is another wonderful Zoch game, though clearly at its best when all players are familiar with it and know how to play and when not to leave opportunities for other players.

What to say? First, the theme: bizarre. Everything from the name down through the artwork makes you laugh or cringe depending on your temperament. I've never been able to get through a rules explanation without someone at the table stopping me with a nonplussed look of "Wait, what did you just say?!" But that's okay! At least the theme gets a person's attention.

It's the gameplay, however, that ultimately wins people over. The rules are simple, but the implication of those rules are subtle and interesting. At first you think you should merely win as many tricks as you can, whenever you can. The more you play, the more you realize it's all about timing. Losing a few early tricks can actually set you up for more points later. Keeping track of what everyone else has allows you to time what colors you should win (or lose) with now, and how you might reverse your strategy at a key moment later on.

Are we talking complexity on the level of Bridge or Skat? -- of course not, but there is more going on here than meets the eye. Bonus points for playing well with two -- a rarity for trick-taking games.

This is exactly what I wanted it to be: a light trick-taking game with just enough strategy to it to still be entertaining.

I love trick-taking games but they can sometimes be really thinky and tense (Tichu, Sticheln, Bottle Imp, etc.) so I wanted a light one to play when I'm not in the mood to get all stressed out. This seems like it will fill that void. 

It's a very, very simple game with just three small twists to keep it interesting. On a turn you play a card from hand and the highest card wins the trick. Simple. The twists are that you can't play a card of a suit that was already played, the suits are asymmetrical (the yellow suit has lower values while the red suit has higher values for example), and then there's the titular Potato Man. The three lowest-value cards in the game depict Potato Man, while the three highest-value cards in the game depict Evil Potato Man. If Potato Man gets played in the same trick as Evil Potato Man then Potato Man will win the trick.

And that's all there is to it. A nice way end a night because you can easily carry on a conversation while still playing this game competently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's okay. Definitely a new twist on trick takers, but I don't feel it's all that deep. The asymmetric suits are interesting, but being able to win a trick with Potato Man is tough. First, someone has to play a high red, then you have to be able to play a yellow card. Most good players save the big reds for when they are safe to play.

I'll give it a few more tries, but if some hidden depth doesn't reveal itself, I'll be selling it off. I have too many really good trick taking games to put up with okay ones.

One and half games, simple filler, should be fun to play with both gamers and non-gamers. Good looking cards.

The idea is that there are 4 suits and you can never play the same suit on the trick someone else already played (not including the five player variant). The highest card wins the trick and depending on the suit you used to win you get points. Add a couple of twists and here you have a simple and good filler.

One short play more, this is a decent trick taking game with a little twist in the scoring (like they all have). Quite easy to teach and play.

This is a trick-taking game that's hard to predict.  The trick (ha!) is that you can't follow the lead; in fact, you have to play a card that's a color that hasn't already been played to the trick.  If you can't, the round is over, and that's part of the unpredictability.  There's also the issue of not being able to predict what other people have, though you can get an idea of color based on your own distribution of cards in your hand.  There's something intriguing about it that will keep me playing, though, to see if this is just a game with a subtle learning curve, like Flaschenteufel.

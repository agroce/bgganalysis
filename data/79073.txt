I like the Resident Evil franchise but this one is very unbalanced, it has some super weapons that could literally destroy anything on that box but also it has other weapons that can't even scratch the skin of those monsters. The artwork is exactly that of the video games, it is deck building though and I am not a fan of deck builders.

Played once with 5 players and all expansions, though not all modules were added. Game lasted nearly 3 hours and no fun was had at any point. Deckbuilding is functional but the Mansion deck is just awful game design -- the winner is basically chosen randomly.

Great style of Dominion play and all the characters and abilities usually make for different gameplay every time.

I'm not too keen about deck building games. This game however, is a good cut above the others.

First though, the rules booklet is really quite bad. The fonts are small and the color of the letters blend into the background color at some areas. Not helpful at all, as some rules are vague. (Eg, the gold to be used and ammo requirements.....are they complimentary?)

The game play though similar to the likes of deck building games, gives a sense of excitement when combating the evil.

That is the only plus point in such games. I gave it a point higher, as the effects does bring the theme, somewhat, out.

There are concerns that the game may drag out, or your first encounter may be the boss itself. This can be easily adjusted without much destruction to game play.

The mansion deck can be reassigned/readjusted to a 3 level mansion deck. The lower level includes weaker zombies, to mid level with skilled zombies and last deck being only 1 card, the boss. A 'kill' limit of at least 3 lower zombies, 2 mid skilled zombies, before the character can face the boss.

Each time the boss is attacked and not killed will lead to a stronger boss by placing counters to indicate an increase till a limit. (Maybe a 100/100 ?)

A below average game, but rises above with the theme flow.

The most simple of the deckbuilding games I have tried. But that is not necessarily a bad thing.
Pretty fun, although random when you do not know what monster you will be facing. But I could easily play several games in a row on a gaming night.
Seems to catch the theme pretty well!

This dominion wannabe is pretty rough around the edges but is very fun to play if a little long.

Becomes a little more refined with every expansion. Mercenaries being the one that turns the game into a truly great deck builder.

Didn't expect to like this, but it was enjoyable for a deck builder. I liked how hilariously unbalanced the dungeon deck could be - "Oh, you found a healing herb! I found an instant death behemoth!"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Frankly, I really liked the base set of this game. I felt that once you got the hang of it, it became a tad too easy. However, having a good crowd of people to play with that kept coming back to kick the doors down into the mansion made the game very memorable. Definitely has a good amount of replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Excellent for fans of the resident evil series or zombies. good fun with friends and can even be played solo.

Some criticise this as a dominion clone; and it is. But where dominion is more about a 'scientific' style buildup of cards with less chance, resident evil adds an element of randomness and luck. its exciting not knowing what foe comes out of the mansion next! and strangely addictive.

An excessively chaotic and random deckbuilder that I will try to give more time. They made some poor design choices with the font on the cards. I really struggle to see why I'd want to play this over Dominion or newer, better deckbuilders. Ultimately the theme feels tacked on to the mechanics and isn't integrated in any meaningful way.

Doesn't excite me at first blush. Love the theme, but thusfar I find "deck building" to be extremely lame. For all those complaining that this is a Dominion clone, well, I'm glad that I don't have Dominion then! Will keep trying this, though.

The random encounter in the sewers seems like a pretty terrible idea, and hitting the worst monster once or twice will put you out of the game. What's the point of a deck building game with such a huge random luck element in *every* setup?

It's not a good game, it lacks deep variety.  I think an expansion would help it, it seems that Bandai broke this game into two or more parts and they should have left it as one game at a higher cost, because as is, it's incomplete.

RATING: 7
Well, it ain't going to win any awards for originality (it's a deckbuilder released during the peak of Dominion-fever), and it's definitely not the most balanced game around. Actually it's basically a clumsier, messier, but more thematic Dominion. If you're a Resident Evil fan you could do far worse.

It can take a while to finish if the cards are against you, but it is fun. The cards need to be sleeved because they are not the best quality.

Okay game, but seemed to have a slow build-up compared to Dominion and other deck-building games... it was too easy to get choked up and draw a handful of guns w/o bullets or vice versa.  This seemed to be partly a newbie issue... but it seems very hard to get the crappier cards out of your hand... (i.e. your deck always seems to be "bloated").

Not bad for a deck-builder, my real complaint with this game is the mansion deck, unlike games like thunderstone where they start out easy and get harder, you can draw the final boss on the first turn and be destroyed.  Plus the lose your turn cards and mechanic when you die makes it hard to catch up.

Not one of the best deck building games but definitely the most thematic. Certainly worth trying. 
It is one of the games where you have to optimize the most and it can seem nearly impossible for newbies to slay the villian in story mode.

Pretty decent little deck building game, much more interesting than I thought it would be. The solo variant is very challenging as long as you play with the rule that you [i]have[/i] to explore every round, which I like even though I have still never won. I have yet to play the competitive multiplayer game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've only played it solo, but I can tell the mechanics are really straight forward and creaky.  The main problem is the extreme variability in the mansion deck.  It feels like you should seed it in a certain way so the monsters get more powerful as you go on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Similar to Thunderstone but I do not like it as much.  The randomness of exploring the mansion is unsatisfying and creates a boring end game condition where players will not go in unless they draw enough damage to kill the badass in the deck (90 damage) because they can't afford to die anymore.  This drags the game out way too long.  

Also, the card quality sucks.  You would think the publisher would use a printer that is capable of cutting cards to the same size.  There are 2-3 mm differences in length between some of the cards, which makes shuffling ridiculously difficult.  Cards therefore tend to stay clumped together, which is bad, and feel like crap - which really detracts from the game.

Wow, this game was really horrendous. A lot of problems, but the back-breaker was the playing time, which weighed in at 2 hours, and we were not playing excessively slowly. I have no idea how it can possibly come in at the 30-60 min advertised on the box.

Couple this with a graphic design that makes Dominion look flawless and uninteresting and hugely random gameplay and you have a game that is objectively bad - I can conceive of no logically consistent taste in games that would make this game anything more than a hack job. Elijah, sorry I missed your comment before trying this abomination. Brian, I expect better :)

This actually is the original + the expansion Alliance in the same box. The expansion box was crushed but the cards are fine. I took a Thunderstone expansion box and combined it with my Resident Evil boxes. The Resident Evil boxes are not designed very well for combining expansions. I separated the cards by the set so you can see for yourself what comes in each set. It also contains the Chris and Jill Promos

Not a bad deck-builder, and it does have some elements I like.  It has two forms or currency (bullets and money) as opposed to games like Dominion.  However, it is extremely luck-driven as to which monsters come up when you try to kill something.  So you can have bad luck and get something you can't defeat -- or have a huge number of bullets, and get something really small.  If you're lucky and things line up perfectly, you'll get the high-point bosses and win.  Still, it's not a bad game to play every so often if you're a zombie or Resident Evil fan.

Review from one play, and watching a second.

This game is similar to Dominion but no where near as good. In fact I found this game rather boring. We spent a lot of time just trying to get decent cards before entering the house, and if you have a poor hand (which happened far too often) you get scuppered when a monster shows up. Half way through the game I was ready to just give up.

Maybe the expansion adds to it but I'm not convinced with this game.

RATING: 4
It could be good, but it needs some serious rule tweaking. Start by removing the Gatling gun. It is completely broken. Next throw out the character powers and make new ones. Some of the existing ones are good, but there is little in the way of balance. After that, you'll need to figure out a set of buy cards that actually make sense together because the deck building is basically nonexistent in the card sets provided. The aren't really any strategies in the cards. Maybe play with all the cards in the box. The rules mention it as an option and it is probably the only sensible way to play with just the base set.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I was pleasantly surprised by this one.  My only deck building game experience so far comes from Thunderstone, and I honestly like this game better.  The Action cards add a bit of variety to the game, and the premade Characters add cool abilities that really change up the experience.

The Resident Evil world is a perfect fit for deckbuilding, and the Explore mechanic has that "what's behind the next door" feel to it, and captures the survival horror genre quite nicely.  You FEEL like you're playing Resident Evil, which was really quite amazing.  If you're a fan of deckbuilding and Resident Evil, it's a must-play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Based off the hugely successful video game franchise, the game and its expansions span the many games, from the classic RE1, up to RE5 (Including bits from RE 0 and even the spinoff Outbreak series). Take control of various characters throughout the games history, purchase weapons and actions, all while fighting the hoard of monsters in the 'mansion' (Monster deck). 

Defeating enemies grants you points which you'll use to figure out the victor at the end. Play resumes until all players have perished, their infection meter has maxed out (Outbreak expansion rules) or the final boss has been defeated (In which players tally their scores, highest score wins).

Each set has a good handful of scenarios to play, using different weapon/item and action layouts, making some scenarios easier or more difficult. Characters have abilities they can unlock which can range for super helpful to super useless, depending on the scenario. (Best to use the characters with their respective expansions to ensure you get proper use of some abilities). 

A rather fun game that can be played solo, is fun to make custom monster decks to adjust difficulty even further and tailor your own scenarios. A great game that I wish had gotten just one more expansion to cover RE 6, even if I do hate that game with a passion :p.

I went about 5 years between plays. This did not survive the test of time. 
You know how much damage you need to do to kill the boss. You make your deck to draw 90 points every turn. Gatling gun=win. Same strategy game after game. It takes to long to shape a winning hand.  It is fiddly to keep track of actions, buys, explores. I want the game to be more simple and streamlined. 
Out of my collection. I have no desire to ever play this again.

RATING: 7
At first I thought it resembles Thunderstone, but after playing it, I think it's more familiar to Dominion. The card effect bearing little to the theme, so it's kinda dry. After couple of plays it's just about the mechanic. 

It's quite a good game actually. You could still play it with strategy (remember, more Dominion like), and the VP card won't clutter your deck (more leeway deckbuilding, and easier to score). But it has push your luck element too. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Thunderstone without the decision to go to the store *or* the dungeon, now you just decide if you want to go to the dungeon after you go to the store. 

That said, the ammunition/firearm dichotomy is pretty good, and now you take hits when you don't kill the beastie. Giving a provisional 7.5 for now, this game could easily go up or down after repeated play (especially after solitaire play).

A game that I like because it is deck building and Resi (both of which I love). But if it wasn't those two things I wouldn't bother with it. It takes longer than it should to play a game, the cards are not very pretty to look at. There are a few logic holes in the game design and there are not enough different cards in the base set. 
I like what they have tried to do, and hopefully any expansions will fix the problems, but it falls short of the mark for anyone who doesn't like Resident Evil as a computer game. 
Only for real fans of both genres.

I love the resident evil series (prefer the earlier horror games to the more modern shooter types) so I love the theme of this nice little deck building game however its too easy to break. Action after action drawing your whole deck each turn gets a bit lame after a few games.

Currently working on a series of house rules for this (possible including a 'mansion' (kill doctor lucky board) and forced exploration.

Everyone who played the game said they liked it, and all rated it above Thunderstone, another deck building card game where you go into a cave instead of the mansion to kill monsters.

Favorable comments:
Like being one character with abilities that improve upon leveling up, and like the variety of characters; Simplicity of the cards and the play; Looks good; Play is fast; Impressed with the strong re-playability with the many scenarios built into the game; Excited about the variant where there are no monsters, and players attack each other.

Unfavorable comments:
At the end of the first game, "When is this game going to end?" (Killing the Big Monster took each of us 10+ turns when we could do nothing because of weak hands--We learned this had happened to another group. In the next two games this wasn't a problem.) Also, not a satisfactory way of keeping score of health--used paper & pencil, but easily jumbled after a player had taken a few deaths.

I find it interesting that the strongest monster ("Infected" one) might be the first one encountered in the mansion. He inflicts massive damage, but when he isn't killed he is shuffled back into the deck--so you never know when he will pop up. Other undefeated monsters go to the bottom of the deck.

Weary of expansions, but yes, will be getting them. (So many more avenues for expansions than the other deck builders--for instance, more items to pick up in the mansion, not just new monsters.)

Deck Building Games in order of how I would pull them off the shelf to play: 

Puzzle Strike (a rising star)
Resident Evil (newest addition)
Nightfall
Dominion (this one has taken a tumble)
Thunderstone (I really like this game. Just like the others better)
Ascension (Still has its time & place)
Heroes of Graxia (Going to sell)

EDITS: When the Gatling gun is discovered very early in the mansion, and the game also has Reload, the player is so overpowered the game becomes broken. From now on I think if Reload is in the game, we will put Gatling gun in the last half of the deck. They are both such powerful cards.

I prefer this game with 3 or more players.

Card quality poor--needs sleeves. 

Poor Box Design:
Unfortunately, once sleeved they no longer fit in the slotted box. 

Before I sleeved & the cards didn't fit in the box, the numbered cards are arranged in the box by numbered slots--note the black numbers on the black insert. I find this curious since the cards you pull for pre-designed scenarios call for the cards by name, not number. Not only that, the numbers do not correspond to alphabetic order either.

The box is too short to add indexes and too narrow to substitute card names on labels.

Despite all these negatives, I really like the way the game plays and is staying a favorite of mine.

EDIT: Have now played all the modes numerous times, including Partnership, and the Versus Mode is by far the best.

Seems like a viable alternative to the other prominent deck building games.  More interaction and some new decorations to the overall mechanics.  Comes with the caveat that if you come expecting Dominion you won't like it.  There is, like Thunderstone, a little more chaos in the system.  So, set your expectations to null and give the game a whirl!

I loved this game! A good substitude of dominion(even they are not the same type of game) A dominion like deck building game,
Strong theme with all chapters' charaters in TV game, easy to learn, allow friendly customize makes lots of varity, lots of fun, difficulty and playtime depend on players and the scenario.., some RP feeling: level up, gear up. The mechinic is good if u can modify it :) 9 out of 10

A deck building game with a full integrated theme (finally!), but also a critical flaw - the monster deck is face down.  There is no way of preparing for what you are about to turn over so there is no planning in this game at all.  Its really quite random.  Still the production is nice and game is well priced.

Rating based on only 1 play. At first I thought this was a decent alternative to Dominion - until I played Thunderstone. Feels like they modeled Thunderstone more than Dominion, but changed the things about TS that made it good - like the dungeon layout of TS vs the totally random "whats in the next room" of RE. Granted, that might appeal to some - not so much to me.

So here's what happened. It's a parable.
Thunderstone saw Dominion, and said, "hey, that's neat," and then riffed on it. It introduced some awesome new ideas, but overall it was designed with less polish and refinement. FWIW, I prefer Thunderstone.
Resident Evil saw Thunderstone, and said, "hey, that's neat," and then riffed on it. It kept the worst bits of both, and decided to throw in lots more randomness and wonkitude. It's messier than a B-grade zombie flick, which I suppose is thematic. That said, it introduced some neat bits--namely new modes (mercenaries in particular) and ideas (characters). 
The fact that I still enjoy it is a testament to my unjustifiable fondness for the RE theme and my appreciation for the neat bits.

Really didn't click for me. REALLY wanted to like it, but it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to my games collection. Most similar to Thunderstone for me, but feels like it has far to much time where you are stuck doing the build up phase. Also to any who are interested in buying: buy sleeves, you WILL need them. After a couple of shuffles the cards love to warp. I'll give it a few more goes, trying it with other people, so we'll see if it changes score later.

Resident Evil: the Deck Building Game is a great entry point to deck building games for new, videogame-oriented players. The RE-DBG shares a majority of the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/36218/dominion]Dominion mechanics[/url] (e.g. trash, action, buy) but with the Resident Evil theme.

I would recommend this game to fans of the Resident Evil series as the multiple game types seem to mimic them quite well.

After my first few playthroughs, I have only a few criticisms of the Base set:

1) The cards do not fit in the box when sleeved. Apparently, this is fixed with the storage box provided with the Nightmare expansion.

2) The game length is highly variable (30 minutes - 2 hours) since zombie behind each door are unknown to the player.

3) Random chance seems to dictate the contents mansion with each explore and your weapon loadout will rarely prove adequate to defeat the boss given the limited draw mechanic and ammunition system. This can be remedied by changing the boss card with house rules.

4) Limited amount of card options in the base set.

The best Deck Building Game, and my favourite Board Game so far.

This is amazing, I had the idea RE DBG was the first, but reading coments I see there was at least dominion 2 years before (RE DBG was released in 2010). 

We love to play it since at least 7 years ago, sometimes making adjustments because we were more than 4 player. It has not stopped being amazing at all. Being in the RE universe makes since start very interesting every card, and even when some could think what you can do with just cards is very limited to describe RE atmosphere, this game is so good that by reading effects you can get the feeling and meaning of it, a claw, an infected poisoning you, Nemesis attacking all nearby allies with his rocket launcher. Weapons also have a very special way of balancing. So sad Bandai and capcom didn't continue with more expansions, there are so many RE games that could be added, and in fact, it could be the only flaw: no expansion is thematically exclusive to a game; but with all the expansions if you want, you can make good scenarios for RE1, RE3-2 (RE2 is really missed to have more), RE4, RE5, RE outbreaks. 

But, specifically about the first expansion I feel is the more balanced and has be best items included in the mansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Dominion meets  Resident Evil, but with 50% less cards. Mechanics are actually pretty solid, You use money to grab different items such as first aid sprays and herbs and more importantly many weapons from the Resident Evil universe. But what I like is that you need to load those guns with ammunition if you want to use them to traverse the random mansion deck. 

Resident Evil DBG is a fairly easy game to play and has some unique mechanics that feel a bit thematic to its source material. My main gripes are that the mansion deck can be overly random. You can fight a huge baddie will traversing with a pistol and a knife and get rocked, or on the flip side, have enough guns and ammo to take on ISIS, and wind up fighting a lonesome zombie. Also there is balance issues with some characters, some of which can be become broken, with only one set. Its main crime is that the base game doesn't have enough in it to keep the game varied and interesting from the get-go. With all the expansions, there will a ton of cards for it, But with only the base, you will wind up using most of the same cards each setup and building your deck the same exact way since it's the strategy that works.  "Mercenaries" feels slightly more complete since it adds "skills" which can vary up game play a bit, which I recommend, over this one, if you were only getting one set.  However the game goes from a 6.5 to an 8 or even an 8.5 with 2 or more sets/expansions to go with it. Solid deck-builder and unique enough to be in the fray with many deck-builders at there.

Fun, thematic, but highly chaotic. Early bad draws when exploring (fighting infected) can hurt, badly, both from the damage (or possible death) and failure to get early XP and therefore get your character's ability. Still fun, but this is NOT a complex strategy game on par with Dominion or Thunderstone.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (February 2011)

Awful game. As I‚Äôm a fan of Dominion and Resident Evil, I though this game was going to be a blast. I was very wrong. 

The game components are adequate as well as the art. What I can‚Äôt take is the monsters deck. It is too random and you don‚Äôt know what you are facing until you go to the mansion, HOWEVER what really piss me off were the 2 weapons hidden in this deck. An RPG and a Gatling gun if my memory serves. Only luck decides if you get this or not and the other players don‚Äôt have a chance at getting a similar card :angry:. The player that gets one of this weapon has a massive advantage over the other players. Also the game took a loooong time to play, I can play several Dominion games in one of Resident Evil, NOT FUN.

Also I have questions about the character balance.

It is a bad copy of Dominion and Thunderstone and I prefer both games over this one.

In conclusion this game has a lot of undesired luck, from the natural variance of the deckbuilding genre, to the random encounter in the mansion and the unbalanced random character selection. I know there are a lot of expansions out there but I don‚Äôt want to play them yet. I will sometime in the future (I hope they fix the base game). For now I don‚Äôt want to have anything to do with this game, I expected a lot better. This is the worst deckbuilding game I have ever played (and I love Zombies). I sold my copy and my promo cards.

This is a biased review but I'll give it anyway.  The reason I like this game compared to some of the other deck building games is the random mansion deck that you go to explore.  The problem I have with the other games is that if you are the better player than your friends then you always win.  The randomness of your deck draw doesn't really reduce your playing ability compared to the weaker players and we rarely are always the same playing level.  In Resident Evil, the random mansion can either really help you or really hurt you so you have no idea what might happen on your turn.  In the other games you know exactly what you can do on your turn and there are no surprises.  I enjoy this aspect of the game because I still try to employ my standard strategies but it always has different results.  This makes it fun for me each time I play.

This game lies somewhere in between Dominion and Thunderstone. It uses the same mechanics, but with an Explore twist, where players can draw monsters and try to kill it for VPs.

I think the game (or the Story Mode variant anyway) needs a way to kick start the game. Because the first 20 mins are spent buying cards and no one Explores. It pretty boring. Only when you get to the monsters does the game pick up.

Always been a resident evil fan and this deckbuilding game stays true to it's colors. This game is very combat driven as your suppose to kill as many zombies/infected before getting butt raped by the boss lol

Having the boss randomly inserted in the mansion is the best part because you can encourage your friends to explore  the mansion only to have him get killed by the boss first turn xD

The artwork is meh cuz it just uses screenshots from the game. But the card design is great and the card itself is very durable.

There has been a misprint on TWO cards out of 1000ish but I'll let that slide...

There's tons of replay value if you get all the game sets. Highly recommended if you like resident evil or deck builders with a lot of killing involved with/against your friends.

Oh, and here's a fanmade card I made for the game xD

This is a dominion clone, yet with a bit more randomness. The way you score points is you flip cards from the mansion deck and hope you have accumulated enough damage to kill the monster, the problem lies in that the hp of the monsters ranges from 10 to 70, which is a HUGE spread. If you die because of a bad flip you lose a turn, which is an awful mechanic, in my opinion. The reason this game is still in my collection and still has some merit, is because it does a few things dominion does not. Your deck acts as an inventory that you fight monsters with. This is an interesting way to use your deck instead of simply building a deck for no reason. The flavor of this game is also very strong, and the special powers are interesting and genuinely unique. Overall, not a perfect game, but definitely worth a play before you write it off, especially if you are a ResIdent Evil fan.

Game kind of breaks down by letting you spend infinite turns not going into the "mansion" to fight monsters. Turns the game into waiting around collecting power ups until you are more than prepared to kill whatever you run into. The Outbreak expansion helps this by introducing a time limit, but I still don't like the game.

DOMINION with Zombies!! Well, OK, that's a little unfair - there are a few extra mechanics added to this that make it trying out at least once if you're a fan of the theme but have played Dominion ragged. The different starting decks and leveling mechanic for characters are nice touches, as is the presence of 'tokens' in the mansion deck, which is a clever replication of the way that easter eggs pop up in video games. 

The game does bog down at the end though, as players spend turn after turn woefully riffling through their oversized decks trying to find that one perfect combo that'll finally kill the boss monster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A solid deck-builder with a zombie angle and a 'common enemy' mechanic. It does seem to suffer from 'momentum' issues; once the decks are rolling and the first leader emerges, that player is almost always the eventual winner. Still fun and engaging though, and the Biohazard theme is a winner.

 The imagery is hard to get behind. I can draw 2 pistols, 3 knives and a shotgun, while walking into a room? Or the next round just hang out in the hallway because all I did was pull a bunch of ammo? Seems like a more intelligent method would be to orient items into two hands and have some sort of method of how you pull cards to support those hands. I appreciate that you run the risk of illogical imagery when making a very thematic game, but it all seemed a little ridiculous and actually pulled away from the theme. Not knowing what is behind the door is neat, but its also a bit annoying because after a while, you don't open the door unless you're packing 60+ damage and then its a crappy shoot on how much you collect in trophies for the cooperative play. Also, why in cooperative play would I have to skip my turn because my "comrade" killed a zombie?

RATING: 6
Listen, there are a lot of deckbuilders out there, and they all have something to like about them. Resident Evil just works for me the best as I really enjoy the theme, I can play it solo (and it is enjoyable solo) and I don't mind the randomness, in fact I enjoy it in this one. 

So it's not the best, and it won't resonate with everyone, but if you want to grab some guns, a fistful of ammo and blast some zombies away, then this will fit the bill.

I loved the Video Game Series (up to RE1: Remake, NGC) so this was a blindshot.

It¬¥s not that bad, but not that good, either. Gameplay Experience enhances by the number of players the more the better (Solo Play possible but not enjoyable, though).

RATING: 5
RE has a lot of commonalities with Dominion, but introduces some nifty tweaks. I particularly like the random nature of the Mansion Deck and the seeding of the weapon piles with lone copies of better guns.

It's got more of a core gameplay experience than Dominion does -- IE, you're doing pretty much the same stuff every time. Our first play took two hours, and the game significantly overstayed its welcome.

I suspect a second game would be faster, but every time I look at the box I'm just bored by the prospect of trying it again.

Dominion with zombies!!  The game adds weapons and an option to explore the mansion that adds random encounters.  The fact that each player has their own character that levels up with new powers and abilities as they kill more monsters adds to the gameplay, as well.  Definitely worth checking out.

This isn't an incredibly well-designed game like Thunderstone, however is still extremely enjoyable. Turns are incredibly quick, so you're never waiting long. Fighting monsters and gaining decorations is very satisfying, and thematically? Awesome. Certainly a worthwhile consideration for any Resident Evil fan. If you're just after a good competitive (and thematic) deck-builder however, and the Resident Evil theme doesn't interest you, perhaps consider Thunderstone instead.

For my money though, I'm very happy with this purchase.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Its been said many times before and I'll agree with them- this is more or less Dominion with a Resident Evil theme.

As in Dominion the idea of this deck building game is to use what you have to trim, modify and improve upon your deck, making each of your turns more and more efficient and powerful as the game progresses.

Unlike Dominion you will be using your improved deck to build up an offensive against a 'Mansion Deck'- an unpredictable stack of enemies and objects which you must best to gain the victory points (known as declarations) needed to win.

I'm not such a great fan of Dominion, and so have found this one to be a slow burner. Only the Resident Evil theme coupled with the chaotic Mansion Deck for victory points has pushed this beyond Dominion into a game I enjoy.

One of my only problems with this so far is that play time is just too long- so far we have not had a game shorter then 2 hours. Whether this is because of early learning is difficult to say. More plays with the game's many variants and alternative builds will determine this, but I just don't have the time or taste for it.

RATING: 3
Played twice (4 player).  Both times the game got quite dull at the end.  Monster deck got down to like 5 cards.  No one wanted to go into the mansion unless they could do 90 damage (enough to kill the big guy).  Pretty boring when the turns go: pass, pass, pass

Solo thoughts here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/656741/solo-mercenaries-mode-quick-casual-observations

UPDATE 2 - the heroes are so wildly unbalanced that multiplayer mode can be a scatter-shot experience.  Lacks the balance and polish of Thunderstone, dropping from a 9 to an 8.  Although I still absolutely love the theme!

UPDATE - been battering Mercenaries mode, and even though you have less options and limited playtime it is possibly even more fun and faster paced than ever.  Just awesome, looking forward to the expansion now...

My first deck-building game this is way more fun than I expected it to be.  Plays brilliantly solo too.  Can go quite long but the guys I play with now have it down so that turns are super fast and there is very little downtime.  That's just Story mode, not even uncovered all the other layouts and Mercenaries options etc yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Only played story mode so far. I was a little apprehensive having read some so-so reviews. After the first few rounds it seemed like we'd never kill any of the infected let alone the boss. But then, resources ran low, inventories got streamlined and hand after hand came up as infected killing machines. The sense of starting with nothing and no hope then building up to almost invincible was brilliant.

Some expansions are going straight on my shopping list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like deckbuilding games and this game is no exception. I like the tension within the game before exploring the mansion and when the deck is almost running out, you know that THE GUY who almost killed some rooms ago, will be there again.
Rules could be more clear and understandable, and some cards really leave you with the feeling of not knowing if they were played right. (with the rules out of the box. I will need to look into the forums for some answers).

Solid 8. Looking forward to play it with more people and to adding some of the expansions.

Got this game after playing a friend's copy. One of the first 'new' games I purchased when getting back into tabletop gaming. I'm a fan of the Resident Evil video games, so I think I liked it out of fanboy appeal. After having played other 'new' games, I've decided that there are better games out there.

RE-DBG draws heavily from Dominion gameplay.

Playing the Mansion scenario is very slow. Our group's favorite mode was Mercenaries as it was faster and felt more like the video game's desperate survival play.

My wife is a Zombie nut. Unlike most people, I think she only knew of Resident Evil from the movies and not the video games. So anyway she purchased this beauty and we are now enjoying a third kind of deck building game. I would say our top 2 deck building favorites are Thunderstone and Dominion, but this game has some fun elements and a whole new theme. 

I will say the cards are not of the finest quality. They are a bit thin and surprisingly slippery (this makes them slip around easily and not stay in their stacks on the table and they warp). I can't really compare them to any other card...since I know of no other card type like them. I'm afraid the rulebook is not my favorite. I think it would have been nicer if it started from scratch for those new to the game, that maybe never played a deck building game before...and for those of us who have...maybe some nice visual examples of how to set up the play area with the decks. The whole mechanic (and I hope I got this right when we played our first couple of games) of shopping and fighting in one turn was difficult to grasp and I still am not sure I did this right. I did like the market items...but sometimes it feels like you are shopping for gun, gun, gun, gun, plant, action card, gun, knife, action card, gun, gun. Maybe not enough variety...not sure though needs more plays!

Overall, I like the theme, I have a blast hunting down those infected beasts in the mansion and will keep playing this one!

I really like this one after giving it a few more tries. Love how different the characters play with their abilities. The base game is not the best thing there is, but add a few extras from this and that expansion and you have a top-notch and super fun deck-builder which I now far prefer over Dominion although this one is not as finely polished as Dominion.

Still, the theme is fun, the mansions are great and diverse and the weapons are generally really cool.

For best game play add:
- Infection from Outbreak
- Skills from Mercenaries 

Optionally also play partner mode. Great game with loads of fun to be discovered and several different play modes, plus the super fast mode that comes with the mercenary expansion to play a quick game in 10 minutes.

Fun game, but I think it desperately needs expansions to help balance the monsters and guns. Either the monsters present no challenge or absolutely own you. Plus I can't tell you how many times we've gone up against the boss just to have him get shuffled back in. You end up constantly passing your turn until you hit a jackpot of a hand and find out you're not going up against the boss...

My failure is thinking a deck building game can replicate a dark atmospheric video game. The only thing which this game can replicate is the graphics on the cards. As you open the door (the deck) you are met with the resident ghoulies and hopefully you have stocked up your weapons well enough, if not, you lose a life. A bit of too much luck is involved in this game and it is just falls a bit flat. It's ironic that it's a game about Zombies and you feel like one afterwards. Is that irony, I don't care I'm dead board.

Didn't make the cut as it didn't replicate the terror.

I would have given this game a bit more points if it wasn't for the super crappy manual. Full of typos and very unclear. If you want to learn to play, save yourself the grief and go to the website for the game and check the live tutorial. Also, peruse through the forum, it clarifies all the untold issues that arise from interpreting the poorly worded manual instructions.
Other than that, after a couple plays, I really like this game. It is very engaging for my kids, who can relate, and it does have a good theme for a deck building game. The fact that there are characters alone, makes for a nicer game than most other similar games. Makes me kind of think of getting "Heroes of Graxia".

Resident Evil plays a lot like many deck-builder games, most notably Thunderstone, with a few exceptions. This game is actually a bit more random and unforgiving.

For the most part, I like the way you purchase cards into your deck and the kinds of combos you can create, but most of the cards boil down to guns/ammo or actions that let your draw more guns/ammo. 

The mansion can be terribly unbalanced, one second giving you a free gatling gun and the other second killing you instantly with a boss monster. Surprisingly, this helps hold the theme of the Resident Evil video games pretty well.

Overall:
It's nowhere near my favorite deck-builder, but it's definitely some light-hearted fun. I'll probably return to try out more game modes and even play the expansions.

Now, here's the thing. I love Resident Evil. It's one of my favorite video games of all time. So, of course, I give special treatment to this deckbuilding game. That said, this game is kind of samey to other deckbuilders but does have a few unique ideas. I have all of the expansions, so I enjoy the variety of cards, scenarios, and characters available to play with. The manual is abysmal.

Theme is of course amazing. Because Resident Evil.

RATING: 7
It has a lot of elements that I was happy to see explored in a deck-building game. My major gripe with this game is that it has a steep learning curve for explaining this to new players (meaning it's probably only going to get played by hardcore gamers and fans of the franchise), and that there are some unnecessary rules.

It's still worth picking up though despite that, and is fun once you've got the hang of things.

Admittedly flawed, but probably my favorite deck builder. It takes Dominion and fixes all of the issues I had with it (lack of a strong theme, player interaction, etc).

This is just a clone of Dominion (Copper, Silver, Gold, 5 cards, 1 action, 1 buy) but then hobbled (must combine treasure, aka ammo, with guns in proportion in order to attempt to buy VPs, which is then done at random. Other bad randomness, the most egregious being the random "make another player lose a turn" effects, make this a groaner. The only deviations from Dominion are for the worse. May as well play Dominion.

Awesome theme and really great artwork (among the best art of the deck builders).  This game is fun if you aren't too worried about balance or losing on a bad draw.  The mansion deck full of monsters is very luck of the draw and you can get screwed by drawing the wrong card even when the¬†odds are stacked in your favor while your friend clean up by drawing lucky loot cards.  Still I play this one all the time and it's a great 2, 3, and 4 player game.

Over the course of 2013 I developed a real love for deck-building games, and this really hits the perfect spot for me by mixing the well known mechanics with the zombie fighting from Resident Evil. I think this one is awesome, awesome, awesome!!!
 I like "Dominion" and its simplicity (and if you don't want to go beyond that straight-forwardness stay away from Resident Evil-DBG) but the added tweaks this one brings are just fitting and enhancing. It is very thematic with nice ideas, I love how you need to combine the weapons with the right amount of ammo cards to use them, the Zombies in the mansion deck are a always a great surprise ( a DBG needs this luck element imho, since by working on your deck you get more and more control this balances that out and makes a more open game play), everyone plays their own character, too, that can level up - oh, boy, I can't wait to get more and more plays in, and down the road add an expansion or two. This is MY Deck Builder.
One thing though: Who designed the box? There is no adequate space to store the ammunition cards no matter how I switch things around, and they could have provided players with some tool (or note pads) to keep track of the character's health/damage. That aside, I love this game, and the card design is also fantastic.

 I think i must be missing something here. sit and build a deck until you can kill anything you come across and then do just that. seems like less of a game and more of a (not that)complicated way of moving cards between piles.

 since buying this i've played a couple of other deck building games and they haven't really held my attention either, so maybe I just don't get on with the genre. having said that, I found more interest in those other games than this. will probably sell it.

RATING: 5
Dominion Clone with a few good twists (like the starting character, partners was interesting, theme worked for me.)  But a LOT of flaws - could have used more time in development (and the rule book was a mess.)  

To wit:

1)  WAY long.  Like crazy long compared to the time on the box.  Maybe we had the victory conditions wrong, but I don't see how'd you play in 30 minutes unless you hit a total fluke win condition.

2)  All sorts of rules questions not well handled by the book and not intuitive.

3)  Why so few of each gun?  Why mix in one better gun randomly to add a third random element (your draw, the explore deck, and then each pile).  It doesn't work anyway since you inevitably knock a pile around and see the next one is or isn't the special gun.

4)  Such a large disparity in Infected - would have probably preferred a Pandemic or Through the Ages Style where you either shuffle in the big guys a bit later or have different levels of cards.  In the video game can you fight the ultimate bad guy on the first board?

5)  Turns bog down even worse than Dominion (though I was glad there was a little less card drawing.  

6)  Very imbalanced characters (maybe each is good in a different mode, but in the modes we played some were obvious clunkers).

7)  Too few healing cards, characters died too much.  It's not fun to have your character die.  

We had some very fun situations come up though, and despite how flawed I think it is, the "fun factor" ended up pretty high.  Plenty of cool cards too to mix up what you do with your character.  (I also thought how they designed the healing cards was cool - where you had to decide to use one immediately or wait until you drew two together to get a boost.)  Still, Dominion is plenty good at being Dominion already.

This is a great deck-building game which builds on the foundation of Dominion.  I think this is the first game that takes the brilliant Dominion mechanism and puts it in an actual game.  My wife and I really enjoyed our first game and we give it a 7/10 to start.  We'll see how it goes from there.

Long set up and large foot print. It's a nice game with some great art. Just never really grabbed me. The expansion "Outbreak" adds some depth from what I hear, I own it as well but haven't been interested enough to try it yet.

Nice presentation.  Different heroes are novel.

But it lacks of variety.  Maybe a part of the game has been reserved for the expansion?

Don't use the original design to store the cards.  Your cards will get seriously warped!

Lots of flaw on rulebook.  No life counters.  And why don't the gold&ammo be 1or2 instead of 10or20?  Beautiful look, and crudely made.

Not as dry as Dominion. Makes better use of theme than Thunderstone. Much lighter than both of the above and alot more fun.
I would also never play without the infection cards from Outbreak.
If I'm to play a deck builder, it might as well be this one.

I love the idea of the mansion deck. The only drawback is not knowing what you're going to face which can lead to some really short solo games, however I guess it's thematic!

RATING: 7
Surprisingly good for a licensed theme.  This is what Thunderstone/Ascension WANTED to be.  Certainly a Dominion clone like the rest,  but better options for interactivity than the other clones out there... and WAY better balanced.  The card layout leaves something to be desired, but that's a small gripe.

Dominion is still top of the heap, but this one certainly shoves all the other pretenders into a corner.

Deck-building meets video games. Why not? The concept and mechanics are sound, for the most part. This would be a very solid game, except for a few things:

1) Character balance - let's face it, they're not all created equally.
2) Card quantities - a 4-player game with only 5 shotguns, including the *fancy* one? 
3) Card cost - Reload is severely under-priced for what it does, while SMG's are pretty much worthless, compared to shotguns. This is crucial in Story Mode.
4) Box design - card spaces are not very well thought out.

Having several game modes is nice, but Mercenary Mode is a complete joke if you're playing a 4-player every-man-for-himself setup.

I would probably rate this a 2, but went with a 4, since I feel guilty for not finishing a complete game.

Like any deck building game, there are cards that are popular early, and different cards that are popular late, but this is exaggurated in this game.  Ideal play of this game seems to be buying ammo and actions first, then concentrate on getting enough weapons before they run out, and then once you have everything you need, start going to do the dungeon deck.  If you jump the gun, and enter the next phase too early, then it really hurts.  So "strategy" comes down to just choosing when to stop buying one type of card and start buying a different type.

The player identities are non-symmetric. They also seem to be non-balanced.  It's a clear sign that the game was rushed out without much play testing.  

Even as a fan of deck building games, I'm staying away from this dud.  I'm glad I got a chance to try it without buying it.  There will always be new deck building games to buy, so don't bother with this one.

[Sleeved]

STORY MODE: The way the game is set up, it does a great job of simulating the experience of the video game.  It encourages loading up on items and weapons before going after the baddies, and the ammo-weapon variety forces you to be a little more careful in how often you go into the mansion, and how much ammo you spend.  It also winds up being pretty hard, again much like the video game.  As the game draws to a close, it can be a monotonous experience of waiting for the right hand to enter the mansion as you draw your hand, don't have enough, and pass until your next turn.  I've seen this happen in Thunderstone, too, so while it's not unique, it's still a little aggravating.

That being said, I do like the game.  It runs a bit long for this sort of game (two hours!), but it could be that we got a little over-eager in getting into the mansion.  There are some complaints about the randomness of the mansion deck being too chaotic, but I think it emulates the feel of the video game there, as well.  Fans of both Dominion and its clones, as well as Resident Evil, will really dig the game.

In Resident Evil, a deadly virus has caused the dead to rise and infect any living thing they encounter! Fleeing to a mysterious mansion, you must gather any materials you can find to protect yourself and fight for your survival against a legion of infected beings!
\13\\13\
The RESIDENT EVIL DBG will consist of 250 playing cards, 3 different game modes (Story, Mercenary and Versus) and hundreds of possible scenarios within each mode for unlimited replay value. No two games will ever be the same!
\13\\13\
‚Ä¢ Story mode is the main version of the game where players must race to claim the best weapons, items, and ammunition before others get to it first. Quick thinking and a good instinct will help you survive the Mansion and be the one to escape to safety.
\13\\13\
‚Ä¢ Mercenary mode is similar to Story mode but this mode rewards the players that take the offensive. Players must prove their skills by defeating as many zombies as they can in a limited amount of time. This mode can be played in teams.
\13\\13\
‚Ä¢ Versus mode removes ‚Äúthe Infected‚Äù from the game and pits the human characters against each other in a battle for dominance. Players must watch their back as they attempt to defeat each other while staying alive themselves. Watch out because you may find that players are not as merciful as ‚Äúthe Infected‚Äù!

The worst of the new deckbuilding games to come out recently by... a lot. 

Adding MORE random dumb luck to a mechanic that already has a fair amount of variance is likely not the best strategy and at the very least could be done a bit more elegantly (Ascension). Oh, and the "take that" element makes it even worse.

Not a fan.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]Comments:[/b][/COLOR] Every one I showed the game to seems to appreciate the game. There is only one thing that seems odd at a first glance: the rulebook. It looks like no one ever revised the rulebook as for some typography nor to see if there was some missing rules or readjustment to be made, which brings confusion and appears to have a lack of seriousness. One of my girlfriends favorite.

an interesting attempt at deck building, although it seems the characters may not be too balanced.  also, the end game is of quite variable length, as you have to end up with the right weapon combination at the right time to kill the bad guy -- he is also worth the most points by far.  a meh.

Downright terrible. Very unbalanced. No player interaction. You pretty much just wait, and wait, and wait, and buildup until you're strong enough to clear everything (there's no point otherwise).

Bought back when I had just discovered Dominion, and deckbuilding games seemed like the best thing since sliced bread, to me (so I went and bought pretty much all existing deckbuilding games that were out at the moment).

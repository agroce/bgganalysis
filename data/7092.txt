Best of the older Bulge games, and may be still the best with all the new ones...Simple mechanics whith enough chrome, fast and furious pace, a lot of scenarios, a low counter density. A great design for a great batlle!

Great quad game of the Bulge and the German assault through the Ardennes in 1940. Nice small folio size means you can play on a small surface. Own the SPI version and the TSR version which are bar the counters almost exactly the same. Can combine to play the entire Bulge but need to cut the maps to do so. Make copies and play the mini Wacht Am Rhein. A Desert island game for me.

I've played the 1940 campaign twice, the Bulge campaign once, and several scenarios a few times.  A solid game for its time; not too complex, but with decent chrome, and the positive attribute of being a mini-monster with one map scenario slices.  About as deep as I want to get tactically in a game depicting ops of this scale.  Historicity also seems solid -- the Germans can win the 1940, and they have a very hard time winning in 1944.

Played one of the one-map games, St. Vith. Nice mechanics (based off PGG, IIRC). But it's so tough for the Germans!

Gave an extra +1 rating because you can play the 1940 campaign as well as the 1944 version. How awesome is that?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm finding a lot I like about this system. First, it's a system, once the rules are learned you can play four one map scenarios, two two map scenarios, and five four map scenarios. The system isn't simple, but it's rather elegant and very polished. You know the type of game where you read the rules and say ... "Ahh, this guy played this thing dozens of times before it saw press". A feeling all to rare now-a-days.

One of my favorite aspects of the game is the way that the turn order interacts with functions like road movement (called Movement mode) and artillery status. It's all very simple, but the result is profound.

Movement mode is a cool concept, a lot like strategic movement ... but in games set in the 19th century (ex: American Civil War or Napoleonic). Units in movement mode are "strung out" along roads, unable to end their turn adjacent to other MM units. They can enter enemy ZOCs and even attack, a technique that I suspect is essential to successful breakouts by the Jerry player. They can move through friendly units, but at the cost of bypassing them at the off-road cost. Long story-short, MM is critical to the game and adds just enough to the decision tree to both challenge the gamer and impart an "Ardennes feel" to the game.

I also like the way that Parker has handled artillery, another aspect critical to any Ardennes sim. Essentially artillery can be in Battery (able to provide support and barrage), out of battery (unable to provide support, but able to move), and out of battery and in movement mode (hooked to prime movers and able to move at distance). It's simply managed by flipping the counter and placing a MM marker, but the interaction as to when in the turn the flipping happens and the marker is placed/removed ... and it's elegant yet profound.

Finally, I appreciate that the game, despite having more nuances and little rules than I'd expected, simply works. It provides all that one wants in an Ardennes sim cleanly and allows a focus on strategy and the session's narrative.

I also appreciate that the campaign scenarios allow one to explore the other operational goals available to the Germans in 1944; plans less ambitious and perhaps more achievable.

I have the SPI edition.  The game plays well and is not hard to learn.  Also appealing is the quad nature of the design that allows focusing on one area of the overall battle or combining.  The addition of a scenario for the 1940 fighting in the same area is a great bonus.

I won't rate this as I am not a wargamer and I don't have the experience to judge it fairly in comparison. I have avoided the genre but asked to play a wargame just to try one out. We picked the scenario at random, Clervaux, and I left my experienced opponent Mike take the Germans, as they were making the greater decisions. Having said that, as the US, I spent almost the whole game doing nothing or being forced to retreat. I got a ton of reinforcements right at the end, but this was meaningless apart from getting me marginally more VPs than Mike. I can see where I made a few tactical mistakes (partly being mislead as to my reinforcements), but the game/sim as a whole just didn't really do anything for me. It was interesting to see how Mike used the different units and brought them in and out of combat, and it was interesting to see a real battle pass along the days. But not a lot happened, it wasn't engaging or dramatic enough for me. I'm not saying it was bad, and I think my appreciation of the scenario itself was lacking, but the game didn't mean much to me at the end. No doubt with experience, or an understanding of good military tactics, I would have got more from the game, but the game itself didn't help me get either. Still I am open to suggestions...

SPI version,1978? great balance of detail and playabilty...still takes a while to play the campaign. Neat Sedan 40 scenario, don't overlook it. Notes from 12/2004 play: Still enjoyable, though we agreed that the US gets to blow up too many bridges, too easily. The system is very tough on the Attacker, and we doubted that the Germans would get to the Meuse given average luck/US play

Always wanted this game when it first came out but being an impoverished student could never find the funds.  Finally got a copy earlier ths year and (at last!) solo'd the Sedan scenario. Turned out to be a much closer game than I expected with a very close French victory. Not the German walk over you would expect. German needs to use march moves as much as he can. French player needs to plan his withdrawals, prepare his lines of defense in good time and dont be afraid to sacrifice the odd unit to buy time. Low French unit density makes this a challenge. The French player wins by slowing the Germans more effectively than they did in real life. I'm looking forward to trying the 1940 campaign game.

Three battles from 1944 and one from 1940 along with two campaign games.

The system reminds me of the old SPI quads with a few wrinkles here and there, but you can be set up and playing in no time at all.  The counters could definitely use a reworking.

Dated but at the time one of the hobbys best designs on the Bulge with valuable information, scenarios and order of battle. Innovative in its use and teaching of movement in the Ardennes. My gripe is that it is predictible that the game will not recreate the penetration and sense of emergency for the Allies. Instead, the WWI style of combat will, more often than not, develop diagonally from Elsenborn through Bastogne give or take 5 hexes east or west, and stay there with stalemate written all over it. The 1940 and Dec 22 scenarios were and still are the best simulations done on their subjects. I hated to have to trim the maps to align them for the campaign.

One of those game's that easier to learn simply by setting up and playing. Personally, I also started by not using all the rules, but rather, the more basic wargame hex and counter rules, particularly of movement and combat, but also all the artillery rules. 

In December 2011 I played the St. Vith scenario, which is a very competitive one, with the Germans needing to smash away at a relatively thin U.S. line, while the Americans try to hold at key spots to avoid defeats or German breakouts. Based on that play I gave the game an initial rating of 7, feeling as though my rating could easily increase as I play this more. After more plays with the Clervaux scenario, raised my rating to 8 (December 2014). I expect to keep and play this one for a long time, as the replay value of the various scenarios seems high, given the relatively complexity of the game.

I was fortunate to have gotten a complete, used copy for free as part of Decision Games sale in September 2011.

(Comments based on 1978 SPI version.) This is from that golden period where SPI hit their peak with great games and great full color graphics. Four games, acting as scenarios for the Battle of the Bulge, and an optional linking version putting them all together. Also a 1940 version of the German attack in the same area that carried their victory in France. Unique, and fun to play. 

Special Note: My rating reflects my lack of interest in the battle, not the quality of the game. It may actually deserve a '10' since it impressed me as much as it did!

Great game (games) on a popular subject(s). Waht's with all the parens? What you got here is a nominal quadrigame, but the way I see it is that the quads are just scenarios for the overall game. This is a mini-monster disguised as a set of four minis covering the BoB at the regiment/brigade level. But that's not all: this chunk of ground also served as one of the main avenues of the German invasion of France in 1940, so Danny Parker and company did a little more research, scribbled a few more rules, drew a bunch more counters and voila! You also get a game on the '40 invasion.
So after you hand your German-playing buddy an embarrassing defeat in the Bulge, you can make it up to him by letting him role over you in 1940 - everybody goes away happy.
The game itself is medium complexity, only made a bit more complicated by the size of the battle and a few special rules for the initial surprise attack, blowing bridges, a handful of special units, and of course the weather. The map is classic late-era RA Simonsen. Until XTR's Wave of terror came out, this was my favorite Bulge game.

Detailed attack and advance system as the Germans attempt to take as much territory before the Allies react.  Great feel of rapid thrusts mixed with desperate defense. Its always great moving the black-colored high powered Waffen SS units in Hitler's last attack. Four games in one with one game (Sedan 1940) dealing with Rommel's thrust against the French.  Fun games.

I like this game, it has two historic campaign battles fought in the same area, 1940 Blitzkrieg to the Meuse and 1944 Battle of the Bulge. Each of the battles was very different. 

This game has been played many times over the years, either the individual scenarios or the campaigns.

Of all of the games I played St. Vith "The Sixth Panzer Army Attack" was the one I played the most, probably because I wanted play Kampfgruppe Peiper

Superb game for the Bulge (CAVEAT: provided you stay away from the DG reprint). The game actually appears on the face of it to just be a set of quad titles, but actually is a major effort by Danny Parker (the recognized expert on Battle of the Bulge order of battle) to present a good quality game at a time when almost every game available had problems with OOB and letting players rip up anything resembling divisional organization, as well as easily dashing about the front to points anywhere additional forces were required. In addition to the smaller scenarios, the entire Bulge campaign CAN be played and is QUITE well done as a full scale battle on all 4 maps. 

The low movement values not only better represent the difficulties in mobility through the Ardennes, but prevent sudden use of units halfway across the map as if they were reserve forces. The effect is that you must plan your advance according to the force you have available in an area, or be prepared to spend the time relocating it as needed. Another unique improvement over other bulge titles of the time was the inclusion of artillery in a more realistic manner. Also the bridging mechanism, blowing bridges or rebuilding them works uniquely well in BftA. 

Finally, considering when this title was originally published, the map graphics were superb. There were some problems in visibility for towns, and the counters were hard at first to read, but the game works so well, those are trivial issues. 

DG did a reprint of the title that has slightly better map graphics but lost some of the the road net somehow (how on earth????). The DG version also has some minor rules changes that really alter the game play, permitting advance with only one unit in a combat for instance. The SPI & TSR editions are identical in regards to the rules, and work very well, but the DG edition really suffers from the rules fubar.

One other really interesting advantage over other Bulge titles is the ability to recreate some of the battles of the initial German blitzkrieg in 1940 against the French. The Sedan scenario is quite interesting.

Well worth picking up on ebay in either the SPI or the TSR edition.

One of the best, IMHO, of the SPI quad games. All the folio games are fun and fairly balanced plus both the 1940 and 1944 campaign games are playable, if a bit large, as well. Highly recommend it.

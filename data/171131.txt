A brilliant, absorbing game that everyone wants to play again and again.

Our group of 8 would normally play 2 or 3 games during a day's session - but Captain Sonar was all we wanted to play for the whole day in yesterday's first try of the game.

All its elements work so well together, resulting in a tense, and intense, team vs team real time experience with each game lasting 20-40 mins.

Our first couple of games were fairly chaotic, with a fair amount of self-damage being inflicted by allowing failing systems to reach breaking point.

But as the day progressed we found that players were becoming far more organized, disciplined, communicative and effective. The last couple of games even had around 10 minutes of hushed team discussions about strategies and tactics before play began.

So this game would be ideal for businesses wanting to provide team building experiences, as it features:

- Planning for long and short term objectives
- Development of effective communication
- Improvement in discipline and organizational skills
- Co-operation: understanding the objectives of teammates and working in a way to assist them in achieving them
- Working quickly while under pressure

We only get 8 players together about once every 6-8 weeks and we're already looking forward to the next meeting so that we can play Captain Sonar again.

Had a good time with my first 4v4 plays of this, but it's very gimmicky and I'm in no rush whatsoever to try it again. The surfacing 'mechanic' where the whole side traces around bits of a ship felt to me like the designers just ran with the first idea that came to them. Suggest playing in moderation - a fun 'occasion' game. Which is probably convenient given the player count!

Jogo estressante, em tempo real, que tem várias qualidades (cooperativo e competitivo ao mesmo tempo, rejogabilidade garantida pelos diferentes papéis etc) e da vontade de jogar várias vezes seguidas. O maior problema é realmente conseguir a quantidade de jogadores suficientes para colocar na mesa. Um jogo para encontro de board games.

A unique gaming experience. It's hard to find 8 people to play, but this is a truly unique game and very likely the single best 8-player game. Exciting, challenging but easy enough to learn, I can't say enough good things. This game is all about teamwork, decision-making under pressure, and listening. On replays, may get upgraded to a 10.

Amazing!  Setup and components are so simple.  Similar to Space Cadets Dice Duel but somehow even more streamlined.  Wow.  This game rocks with 6-8 players.  (1 person can easily run both the engineering and systems boards.)

RATING: 6
3 plays / 7,8 players

LIKE: It is a unique team-based competitive game that plays like the old "Battleship" games. Quite thematic. Both the turn-based and real-time variants were interesting. Charting the enemy sub was quite clever using the plastic overlay.

DISLIKE: The real-time game led to many navigation errors that caused some frustration for opposite teams. Best at high player counts, which can be difficult to corral players. Uses lots of table space.

OVERALL: I liked it better than I originally thought, but I am not sure this game has longevity because the engineer's and first mate's jobs seems mundane, perhaps more boards for them would open the game up more. I could see this working with 6 people, but no less.

This is an impressive piece of workmanship that works much better than I expected. Even drawing lines with an erasable marker was an intense activity here. 
I admire the people who played six games back-to-back - after one, I am pretty exhausted already, but the game itself plays quickly and remains tense throughout. Not sure about replayability, and the necessity to get 8 people together is an obstacle for this getting too many plays, but I am quite eager to try the roles I haven't played yet.

Best way to learn this game is watch a youtube video - 15 minutes and you won't even need to use the manual.  Then watch a gameplay video for 5 minutes and you'll get a very real feel for the game.

Amazing real-time game.  Not like any other boardgame.  When teaching new people play the first 4-5 moves turn-based.  Then go full-realtime.  DO NOT PLAY WITH KIDS.  This is not for anyone under the age of 12-15.  We had some kids join in and they messed it up for everyone.  This game requires honesty.  Super easy to cheat, no one will be able to verify, so usually you want to have people self-verifying.  It's easy to play with 6.  But 8 is still better.  I wouldn't even bother with 4 in real-time.

This is an amazing game though.  Super fun for non-gamers as well.  The crew we played it with was half-gamers, half not and the non-gamers loved it as much as the gamers.  

This is not a laid back game.  In realtime, it's super intense, but very fun.  Battleship elements but so much more about strategy and communication.  

Only slight is radio officer is the most fun, then captain and the first mate/engineer are more just following orders.  So rotate positions as you play.  And give the first mate to who you think is bad at communication or not as quick.

Oh did I mention, do not play with kids.  They like to cheat, they don't get it, they can't handle it, and one person will screw up the entire game if they aren't into it.  Honest  people and high schoolers or older.

1st plays: Even average Matagot games lately have been excellent, and this is a great game on top of that.  The player counts are restrictive 6-8 is really where this will play at it's best, but for that player count it's awesome.  The real time fits well, and this reminds me of what Dice Duel and regular Space Cadets were trying to do, only without all the crazy mini-games that get tiring after a couple of plays.  Tense, fast, and fun.

2nd play: Played again, this time as a role I hadn't played before.  I still really like this.  6 is the best player count, but I like that there are roles that can be given to lighter weight gamers too.  Getting shot by torpedos is scary and this game is a great rush.

One of my favorite games ever for a large group as this game EXCELS with the full compliment of eight players. I could see it being almost as fun with six or seven as the Captain and First Mate positions can be combined without too much confusion. A genuine hit for large gaming groups and quick enough that you can randomize role selection and let everyone have a go at each position in a session lasting an hour or just over.

RATING: 9.5
Fantastic game! Such great tension, but it's not bad tension because you know the other team is under the exact same tension as your team. The communication between the roles with the time pressure is what makes the game exciting. And the satisfaction you get when your radio operator figures out where the other team is, your first mate says "we have torpedoes!" and you verify with the engineer that you have working torpedoes and say "firing at... B-7" ... "direct hit"... it is an amazing feeling. If you have 8 players then you need to play it.

I’m very disappointed with Captain Sonar. Why? I was expecting this to be the greatest game ever made, and it’s not…but it’s still a very good game, nevertheless.

The main problem, of course, is that (ideally) you need eight players. The other problems are communication related: not with your teammates, but with the opposing team. “Did you just say north?” “Did you say ‘stop’, or ‘Stop!’” etc., etc., etc. Have loudmouths as the two captains! As one user here suggested, it might also be a good idea to have a ninth [!!!!!] player as a referee so that both teams know exactly what has happened. Take this experience from the one  game, for example: 

The opposing team started whooping and hollering after they hit us with a torpedo, as if they had won:
“Yes,” I said, “but that’s only two points of damage. You need three to sink us.”
“Right,” was the reply, “and you already had two points from when we torpedoed you the first time.”
“WHEN?!” my team literally cried out in unison. Yes, a referee would have been VERY helpful! We had no idea they had hit us before!

Captain Sonar is a slightly less stressful version of Space Alert (although Space Alert is the better game). It’s like the “threats” in Space Alert have been embodied in Captain Sonar as the opposing team! As for comparing Captain Sonar with Battleship, that’s almost as useful as comparing Scotland Yard with Battleship: both pairs don’t have a great deal in common.

A blast. One of the best party games for 6-8 players. It plays quickly and isn't as difficult to teach as you'd think. Manages stress and tension well.  The engineering role should be assigned to gamers; give your wife that captain slot and let her try to sink someone.

Need to get more plays under my belt, but after a 2 game session this was SUBLIME. Play turn based only to get a feel for it, then real time is absolutely the only way to play. Tense and super COOL, they really created an incredible experience here. It's even really fun to watch. Only doubt is how well it will hold up over many repeated plays, but there were lots of different maps in the box so I think it'll be fine.

In concept, this is awesome. In practice, I can't get past the difficulty of Radio Operator and the huge frustration that comes with it, either playing as the role or relying so heavily on it in another role for overall success. It's a great game, and it's cool to see a team-versus-team competitive game that isn't trivia-based, but I'm not going out of my way to play it. 

That said, this is what Battleship wishes it grew up to become.

A team versus team "submarine experience" game that manages to essentially accomplish what it has set out to create with good tension and action.  I can see this game having considerable appeal for children of a certain age.  In fact, it could be a bit of a bestseller for the young.  As an adult, I do have some concerns about replayability though Captain Sonar likely has a worthwhile amount of frothy fun in it even if you play it a handful of times.

Rating it a 9, may go up to a 10 upon more plays.  

Played 6 time at GenCon, 5 of them being real time and with 6-8 players each time.

Comments that I got from some of the people I played with include: "tense", "nerve-wracking chaos", and "adrenaline rush".  One person who was playing the radio operator was so nervous while trying to draw around the sub during the surface action.

Replayability: Multiple maps are available and throwing in scenarios for the "6th" action can provide a tremendous amount of replayability.

Not recommended for those that don't like time pressure or team games, but anyone who does like those, will LOVE Captain Sonar.

To start off, it's the best 8-player game evar. Gotta give it that right away. Can take longer to teach than to play. 1/4 of the roles (first mate) is low-interest, which may be a feature as much as a bug since an active player can use the slack to liason and strategize, while a passive player can simply run up the dials and do nothing. Even if you think you'll hate it, I recommend trying it once for every gamer.

Some friends of mine purchased this game so we could all play as a group.  To be honest, I was very nervous about starting this game thinking... "this is going to be extremely complicated".  The game recommends starting with Turn-by-Turn play and to my surprise it was very easy to learn.  The game really relies on team work and communication.  I kept saying it would be really handy to know American Sign Language.  We played four rounds of this game in one night, no one wanted to stop playing.  There are so many different strategies, jobs, and maps it never got old.  We never played in "Real-Time" but plan to next time now that we're all comfortable with the rules.  I think Real-Time will give the game a new challenge and excitement.
Overall, I was very surprised at how much I loved the game.

The moment of writing this review I have played the game nothing but once but liked it enough to use the chance and buy it while was in Sweden since it's not sold here in Estonia. Anyhow, what I loved was the real-time chaos and very thematic feel which isn't lost with whatever kind of players since you don't have time to a) drop so-to-say 'off character' and start chatting some not game-related bs b) players HAVE TO communicate to win. It is a great and tense game of teambuilding and otherwise fun connecting.

Good game.
Cheating can be a bit of an issue as there is no control over what the other team is doing. Same applies to get everyone to pause when a system action is perform (especially while the other team are frantically tryng to repair while surfacing).
The Captains also have to communicate clearly - also to the enemy's radio operator - where they are heading. Otherwise the radio operator's job becomes very frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game really is a blast. The co-op aspect is genius: no single person could ever become the real leader here, as there are just too many things to consider in real time. There really is a very good balance between where to move because of positioning, and where should you move because of your systems being shut down.

Also, the deduction aspect for the radio operator, while really tough at times, is a very satisfying experience when you actually can land a torpedo or mine.

Intense team game, a sort of submarine version of Space Cadets: Dice Duel but more thematic. One player role, First Mate, is not that demanding (in fact, might soon become on the dull side), so either give it to a non-gamer, someone wanting a bit of a break, or if there are three rather than four people on the team, combine it with the role of Captain.

Initial Impression: Both realtime and party games are not usually my thing. This game was an interesting experience though. Teamwork and communication is essential to winning and everyone will have a good time if people don't take things too seriously. Unfortunately, the game shares the same weakness with Space Cadets Dice Duel in that you must interrupt the opponents in order to attack them. If they ignore you or are not paying attention, the game inevitably breaks down. The game must be played with 8 people in order to get the full experience so would come out to the table rarely in my groups. I enjoyed my plays of this game but am not excited to play it more often.

This game is the most fun I have had with board gaming.  I have also found it more accessable and easier to get played than many people give it credit for.

RATING: 9
It's a fast-paced, intense game that's almost more like a team sport than a board game. With the right team it's one of the most fun games I've ever played, even when we lose. 

There are only two or three downsides I can see. The first is that playing more than one match in a session is both exhilarating and draining — physically, mentally, and emotionally. But even if you lose it's still fun. 

The second is that it really works best with exactly 8 players. No more, no less. It can be adapted for fewer but you don't get the full experience. Getting 8 people together to play any game can sometimes be a challenge. 

The third, which is a minor issue, and is a direct result of the game's awesomeness, is the apparent complexity of it. It takes a long time to explain all of the gameplay mechanics, but on the other hand, most players don't really have to pay attention to the rules for any role other than their own. 

Overall it's the most fun I've ever had playing a board game, but it's tough to get a game going. So I gave it a 9.

Realtime is very fun! Turnbased mode can even turn off players from this game, so be carefull --> would only play until 1 Hitpoint made for learning and then switch to realtime.

I'll have to test out the different roles more. So far the captain really has a lot of power and decisions. Also the exact communication patterns have to be refined in future games.

---
OLD Entry:
Rating will probably go up.
Only played once in turn based mode for learning. Gets very strategic and too long (90 Minutes) in this mode. It's good for learning the game, but with the next group i play i will only play turn based till 2 hit points. Then the rules should be clear to switch to real time.
Realtime mode will most certainly be better!

This real time team game pits two crews together to try to find and torpedo the opposing submarine. My only frustration with this game is that it can be annoying to figure out which moves are actual moves as the radar tech. However i still enjoy this game a whole lot. It is very fun to fulfill your roll and work together as a team. 

It may take a couple games to feel like you know what you should do in certain positions, but it only takes about 20 minutes a game if you know what you're doing.

Great game. Took a while to get the players to learn their roles, but with a bit of patience from the group and the right crowd, you'll be in for some fun.

However it's sort of ONLY enjoyable at big player counts, and if I get a group this big I'm going to end up having a couple people that are the "Everything beyond cards against humanity is too complicated for me!" types.

And that makes me not really NEED to own this...Which is sad because I really do like it!

I played it only once and we stopped playing in the middle because the other players had issues.
For me the game was exaclty how I thought it would be: you communicate with your team to get modules working and look on your radio man's map to see where the enemy can be and of course you gan and loose contact to the opponent.
We pin point the opponent ship quite good and had 2 indirect hits with one torpedo and one mine but than the enemy went silent and the contact was lost. After a few rounds later there was a big discussion about missing commands from the other team (on our map the opponent ship was outside the map). The discussion was so bad that we ended the game. 
For me it was really okay because this is thematic. You gain and loose contact to your enemy several times in a u-boat :) But the others didn't liked it as much as I did. :(
You should establish (like the rules suggest) and stick to clear communication pattern. You can discuss with your team about going west, west and then east but as soon as you say "course west" the machine officer should say "okay" so that it is hopefully quite clear to the enemy radio officer that I go to west :)
But this can als be the fun part as a radio officer to figure out what is the real command in an ongoing discussion :D

RATING: 8
A brilliantly unique game where 2 teams fight in a submarine duel in real time. People take on different roles as the sub moves around, breaks down, powers up systems to fight or track the enemy, or listens for the enemy to find their location. An easy game to learn and pretty quick to play, but intense and the right amount of stressful while you play. 

When there are a lot of first time players you can try playing it in real time (probably with the smaller map) to give everyone a sense of how to play.

Sooo much fun! In this game, you need to split in two teams each running their own submarine. Each player gets a role (captain, radio operator, engineer, first mate) and need to collaborate with other to find and destroy enemy ship.
The best part is - it's all in real time!!! Captain is yelling where they go, opposite team radio operator must listen carefully and try to track they location based on their movement. First mate is reading ships system and engineer must closely work with the captain to maintain the ship and keep everything working. 
It's a really dynamic game with a little bit of chaos but lots of fun. The gameplay is around 15min. At the beginning, you just try to detect the enemy ship while keeping all your systems ready and working. When you get the signal from radio operator that you know the enemy position the pace changes and now it's hunting game - from both sides. It ends pretty quickly from that point, few well-placed torpedo’s and it's over. Unless someone manages to escape in radio silence (which is hell for opposed radio operator).

Played two 6-player games at Gen Con. An absolute blast and likely the best 'team' game I've played. Unique roles give replayability a high factor: not only will changing team mates change the dynamic, but you have vastly different roles to play as well. 

I think you do have to be comfortable as captain to shout loudly, and the opposing team's radio operator must sit opposite the captain. If they don't hear the opposing captain's orders, it can sink the needed tightness of the game, and this was an issue in the outcome of both games we played, although they both were incredibly tight and tense matches. Can't wait to play again.

The best team game ever made. Strategy and skill matter yet it's just casual enough to maintain a very energetic atmosphere of high-fives and trash talking. Yell over the screen and curse like a sailor as you have to live this one up and experience it with a full 8 players. It's unreal with the right group. We played over 10 games at Gen Con and I still haven't gotten my voice back.

RATING: 8
Mechanical and thematic comparisons to Battleship and the Space Cadets games aside, Captain Sonar is a game that [i]feels[/i] like nothing else you've ever played. On a pure experience level, it stands alone. And that is awesome.

This is a stressful game, so it is definitely not for everyone. The large player count + real time thing might tempt you to label this a party game, but it is most definitely not. It's strategic, but in a chaotic sort of way you could easily screw up, and there's an extent to which it can feel like madness in a box.

Often I find asymmetric multiplayer games a tough sell because learning each role takes time, but the beauty of Captain Sonar is that the rules for each role are pretty simple. The advantage of this is twofold: 1) Nobody likes long rules explanations in the first place and 2) It leads to people being up for switching roles between games, which is really nice.

Because the game is so intimidating and tense, Captain Sonar has a really tricky line to walk - one, I am happy to report, it pulls off expertly. It was probably tempting for the designers to treat each role with the same importance and level of strategy, but again Captain Sonar takes the smarter route: all roles are not created equal. The Captain and Radio Operator are for the bolder players in your group who are quicker on their feet, while the Engineer and First Mate are for players who are happy to contribute in the background and make more straightforward decisions. It's very smart design, as it both accommodates players with different preferences/skill levels, and allows people to take a break from the most stressful roles.

There is [i]one[/i] thing that bugs me about this game, and that is that having to restart your progress as the Radio Operator is absolutely [i]devastating[/i]. It is the harshest role in the game, in that missing one piece of information can throw them off completely (often without them realizing for several "rounds"). Often it feels like if one RO loses track, they've just lost the game for their team. This doesn't have to be true, as a smart Captain/First Mate should react to this by using systems to help them out, but it does feel like it can make or break the game. 

But, the nice thing is the game plays pretty quick and this is the sort of game you probably have to plan its own event for anyway so when that happens, just start a new round, switch up the roles if you like, and have a blast (HAH. +1000 pun points!).

Pro tip: When you're teaching new Captains: take an extra second to drill into their head how vitally important it is to say [b]"Head [Direction]"[/b] . Ignore their commands if they forget the "Head" so they get into the groove. It exacerbates the above issue with the RO when Captains get lazy and just start saying directions as it can be unclear whether they're declaring an action or, say, asking the engineer for advice.

RATING: 6
This was a pleasant realtime coop - a genre that I'm usually a fan of. It's more like Space Alert or Space Cadets than other Wok Star/Escape the Curse of the Temple and those kind of games. What sets it apart is the fact that it's played in two teams (probably best with 4 vs 4, but 3 vs 3 or 4 vs 3 works just fine too). 

What I liked the most about the game is probably the different roles which reminds me a lot about Space Cadets; you are all assigned a unique role, and this - along with the time limit - prevents the alpha player syndrome. Some of the roles are significantly more interesting than others, but if playing in a team of 3, the most boring role is paired with another, so it's not so bad.

However, one thing I didn't like about the game, and what prevents me from (ever) loving the game, is the fact that the game rewards speed; if your team is just quicker at doing the tasks, you will be able to move faster and shoot faster etc. - and this means that you will most likely win. My first 3 plays of Captain Sonar had exactly this problem, as my team was much faster doing all of the stuff, so we could fire torpedos at a faster rate, which just wasn't that fun... Other than that, the game is quite pleasant due to the various roles and the tense atmosphere the realtime presents.

Such a great game to get people involved and off their phones.  Difficult to organize there being exactly 8 people there, but if you can then this is just such a wonderful time.

The hype is real. We played a few rounds turn-based to make sure everyone got the flow of the game, and then unleashed the 8-player real-time game. It was tense ("Blow up the mine!" We can't go east anymore!" "They're surfacing, fire torpedo, kill them!") and a ton of fun. We ended up playing 3 times, switching between the 4 different roles (Captain, Radio Operator, Engineer, and First Mate). All of the roles had unique challenges and really required you to work as a team, communicating under stress. I can't wait to play again with a full 8-player count. The sign of a great game is one that you want to talk about afterwards. All of us stuck around to laugh, tell stories, share strategies, and recount the most stressful moments.

RATING: 9.5
Games that can get people talking are precious, and few games encourage table talk like "Captain Sonar." Every teammate is invaluable, and so every teammate has to be communicating all the time. Consider that the same is true for the enemy team and it becomes obvious that there will never be a moment of silence here. But it's all in service of a very clever, very strategic game that's super tense and superbly paced. It's the kind of game where everyone wants to play again immediately upon the game's conclusion.

I never bought this game because you need 8 players. Luckily, I had the opportunity to play this at AZ Game Fair. The game is great. The first mate's role is a little lame, but the fact that you are all working as a team makes it worth while. besides, a simple role makes it easy for a newbie to join. My game ended in cheers as we returned fire and sunk our enemy's sub!

I love how stressful the game is, how everyone has a unique role, and how those roles interact with each other. One thing I don't like however, is that strategic play often involves set patterns of movements which often results in subs moving in very similar ways. I would love to see multiple Engineer sheets with different layouts on each one for more variety in moving.

I honestly didn't enjoy Captain Sonar very much. There are no overarching strategies, just a continuous stream of micromanaging barely interlocking systems whose mechanics are laughably divorced from the theme with the straightforward plan of "find where opponent is, hit them". Break something enough by going south repeatedly but it fixes itself when you turn west! No thanks. I could -could- be convinced to try it again, but only with the turn-by-turn variant.

RATING: 8
With the right group of 8 players, this is one of the most fun games you can play. It takes a while to explain the rules and get everyone up to speed. I recommend you explain each role, and then do a mock turn-by-turn session where each team can learn how to move, charge systems, and select which systems take damage, as well as execute each system (Sonar, drone, silence, torpedo). Finally, each team should practice surfacing at least once, so they know the procedure.

Once everyone is up to speed, the game is on. Dive into real-time. The first game will likely take a while, as there will be many torpedo misses while the Radio Operator is learning how to track the other team and map their course. Expect mistakes to be made as you discover the finer points of the rules, or simply miss one or two do's and don'ts. Have fun, and do not take winning and losing to seriously. Losing can be as fun as winning, and both teams will have stories to tell about their experience.

Best of all, you can swap players between games and have people change roles to mix things up. Don't let the obvious person always be the Captain, and don;t let "Dream Teams" form unbeatable teams. Split them up if they are too in sync and dominate every game.

One of the highest-rated games that I will never own. Luckily, my FLGS has a demo copy, and most importantly, the table space and the players to play on a somewhat regular basis. I rented it and tried it 2 players, but it wasn't great and definitely not worth buying for lower player counts, in my opinion. I think it's really a 6-8p game. (And Sonar doesn't interest me at all)

Battleship for adults.

I really enjoy this with the caveat that you only play with 8 players and no less. 

The one issue I have with the game though is that you need to find 8 people all interested and ready to play because it only takes 1 person to sour the game due to apathy. It's not the games fault but beware that's all.

If you do have a solid 8 players then you're in for a tense 4v4 battle. Nothing feels more satisfying than when you have this feeling that they are near your mine and then the captain says "STOP! Detonating mine on B7." And then you hear the other captain look up and tell you "Indirect hit." Now the chase is on to finish them off and it's extremely thrilling on either side.

This game is amazing!  I really wish it was easier to get a group of 8 people together to play this, but it doesn't happen too often.  The real time gameplay makes for great tension, and the teamwork and coordination this game requires really makes it special.

2 player turn-based mode is oddly enjoyable and effective at learning the vagaries of each role. A play every twice a week kind of game but a logistical challenge to obtain the minimum 6 friends necessary for getting the most out of the real-time mode.

Real-time mode super fun even with 4-5 players but if any player fails to do their role proficiently (esp captain/radio) it is game-breaking.

Seldom gets played or requested due to the stress generated by playing either mode. Conversely, the stress also generates strong memories of epic gameplay stories of success and failure.

Amazing game that i love to play every single time with some caveat: 
- 6 or 8 players are really the only way to play it
- It can cause frustration to the team that has one player that didn't really understand how it works
- Explaining the rules to new groups is actually longer than the play itself (in other words, it's way better with the same audience)
But when all things align.. this is a blast

RATING: 9
The high player count might deter some people from playing it. It definitely works well with 8 players, and the explanation takes longer than the actual game, if you're playing by the rules the way you're supposed to (I've heard horror stories). The real-time game is fun and frantic, and you can go at whatever pace you like, but it's up to you and your team to determine the best course of action. Requires being able to communicate well. Find some submarine sonar sound effects and turn on some colored lights in a dark room for added ambience.

I played twice with eight... all new players.

Each role has its particular job and is just about as much stress as each job can handle.

An advanced, real-time, team-version of battleship. Great game for when you have eight people. The radio operator is both the hardest and most enjoyable part to play. Captain is good too... I wish the other roles were a little more complex, but they are good to introduce the game to new or younger players. Good balance in the game -- especially when the opposing team fires a torpedo, it quickly gives the targeted team a good sense of where they are to quickly catch up.

I don't get the hype around this game.  We didn't play in real-time mode and honestly I can't see how that would work.  Seems like we'd be breaking rules left and right.  Anyhow, my rating is based around a turn-based play.  It could go up if real-time is more fun.  In my game, basically they found us, we were stuck and had to surface, then they shot us dead twice and won.  :)  It wasn't a very tense affair.

I really like the idea of hidden substrate to find each other. However many the game systems are just absurdly gamey.  Space Cadets Dice Duel also uses little puzzles, but they somehow feel thematic.   Sonar's puzzles don't feel right to me. Why does moving disable ship systems?

However, I do think I'd like playing this, but I'm unlikely to get the right group together outside of a con.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on premise alone this is a must try, especially for convention goers and party gamers. The real time aspect helps this game step out of the party game mold while also facilitating the conversation and outburst moments that are typical to that genre. The 'fun factor' is not consistent through the four available roles, however this is surprisingly one of the game's greatest strengths. The lesser roles allow for rookies, or otherwise tentative players, to immediately mix with experienced players, allowing them to learn the game quickly whilst playing, and eliminating the need to observe for a few rounds before taking the dive. There are options for low player counts, and a turn-based variant, but this game certainly thrives at 8. Unfortunately, it plays long. Since each player repeats their single action over and over, this game would be better suited to a 15-20 minute battle, allowing players to swap teams and roles more often.

At the bottom of the ocean, no one will hear you scream!

In Captain Sonar, you and your teammates control a state-of-the-art submarine and are trying to locate an enemy submarine in order to blow it out of the water before they can do the same to you. Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.

All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.

Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded — then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.

Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.

What a crazy game!

Has a few issues, notably that I feel like a lot of the roles don't really lend themselves to certain types of players, so that can make random role selection sort of rough.

Battleships - real-time cooperative game 4 versus 4 (best with 8 players)

Concern mentioned by some: "too many different roles(each with own rules) makes it very hard to teach, too complex for what it wants to be (party-style fun game)" ?
"Potentially a riot as long as everyone understands the game. There is a bit of a learning curve but once obtained a really fun option for 8 players."
"One person making mistakes can ruin the whole experience."

Two limitations: 
a) Really need to learn the game turn-by-turn first before going real-time.  
b) Not ideal for non-gamers due to some initial learning curve.  
So it can be hard to bring to the table: need 8 players. But with 8 gamers, this sounds amazing and very fun.

Can be stressful.  Two of the roles make less contribution and are more boring?

[b]Sold 12/10/2017[/b] - I liked the idea of Captain Sonar, but it ended up being both a bit of a pain to teach, and too stressful for what it is.  I also dislike playing about half of the roles in the game, so that's another strike against it.  I think Captain Sonar accomplishes what it goes for, but it's not a game for me.  For realtime, I'd rather play pure coop in something like Magic Maze or Escape: Curse of the Temple.

I really enjoyed this one. It is very different to anything else I have played and yet it was accessable enough that my daughter (11) was able to pick up and play with us effectively.

I do think there is more skill and actual game for both the capital and the radio operative, and if you had an evening stuck as engineer or first mate the game could be slightly boring.

The radio operative role is a stroke of genius however we did find and will make a note to ensure it is announced before each play, the captain MUST orate pretty loudly, he must be hear able over the din of the other team mates of this effectively shuts the opponent radio operative out of the game.

I love the look of the 5 scenarios in the game, especially the one under the ice, which also terrifies me at the same time.

Great team vs team game with two modes of play. Real-time mode is tight and engaging where team communication is the key.  Turn-based mode is a light-medium weight strategic game great for 1v1 or 2v2.  The rules are a little iffy but really fun game.

a blast. The only problem is the stress level. So probably you can Play it max. 3 times in one row. Then you are too exchausted.

RATING: 8
This rare team vs team game is so tense and so fun.  When played in real-time mode, the game feels hectic, pressured, and intense.  When played in turn-based mode, the game slows down and becomes very strategic and chess-like.  Both modes are worth trying, although I think the game truly shines in real-time.  This experience simply cannot be replicated by any other game on the market and your gaming group deserves to try it.

RATING: 8
Easy to see why this won the Geek award for most innovative game; such a different experience from anything else I've played. Very intense, and not from going against a clock (you're not), but from trying to prepare your own sub's abilities faster than the other team does. Playing as First Mate was fairly fun, but I especially enjoyed being the Radio Operator and trying to puzzle out where the enemy is.

It is easy to broke the game. 1 Team could just do nothing and wait for the moment they know where the other team is. Then drive their way and shoot down.

It is nothing special here, just a lot of micromanagement. There is barely control of mistakes and cheating.

But it is a little fun playing. Could be convinced to play again, but it is not my favorite with 6-8 players.

I only recently discovered Captain Sonar, but I see a lot of potential for this game as a tournament event. I recently attended a company gathering and as usual was introduced to a couple of new games. The most interesting was of course this odd real-time Battleship-like game. While that doesn't sound all that interesting on the surface, the game turned out to be a blast (and is only a tiny bit reminiscent of Battleship). I played the turn-by-turn mode first and have since played the real-time mode and I'll say that the latter is where it's at. At the company gathering we had hoped to run a tournament of 4-player teams but it never materialized. However, I can see the game making for a great vehicle for such events -- grab 3 friends and start training!

We had trouble because the radio operators weren't really hearing what the other team was saying. The game seems to fall a bit flat if not everybody is on top of their games, so that's a but of a weakness. Having said that, the game is really well done and almost makes up for being a glorified version of Battleship. The theme doesn't really excite me, but overall it's a well executed package.

What hilariously tense fun this game is. It seems like every time I play it, we end up talking about it for most of the night and we also end up playing it over and over again (usually switching roles as we go). I love playing this game but I don't like it with under 6 people.

Needs exactly 8 persons, and noone can make a single mistake.  Or the experience is ruined.  Nice game, but the strict constraints (player number, correct playing during a hectic game, needing a long table, ...) make it very hard to find the opportunity to play this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game does exactly what it tries to do; it's quick, immersive fun for 8 players. The 2 roles I've played (engineer and radio operator) were fun and very different and I think there's enough there to continue being fun while still being accessible enough for anyone to play, which helps with finding 8 willing players. It's fast without being hectic, exciting without being confusing and fun without being complex.

I almost never play the same game twice in a row, but this game can never be played just once!

Shot to the top of my favorite games list after 10 plays in one night! Really captures a theme and runs with it. Loved the different locations in the "submarine" and how they all felt important and different. A must have game, think 8 player battleship but FUN! Only drawback is it only plays well with 6 or optimally 8, anything less is no fun and even numbers are no fun. Still, FANTASTIC game!

The kind of game you play and you immediately say, "Let's play again!" Each person on a team gets one of four jobs: captain, first officer, engineer, and radar operator. These jobs have a sort of mini-game to them that is dependent on the actions of teammates or opponents. The downside is that that means you really need 8 players to enjoy the game. The mini-games are all fairly fun but I think the captain and radar operator are the best jobs.

Probably my favourite party/lighter game. Played turn based both times and don't expect to play real-time. My group is my family so they prefer the slower pace with more time to process things.

RATING: 7
This is a fun game until you get too good at it, which unfortunately happens quickly. Once that happens, the game follows a predictable rhythm that loses much of its luster. It's not bad if both sides are good at the game, but for a game that is best with eight players, there's usually someone learning. Ultimately, there are other games I'd choose over this.

Interesting team deduction game. My first two plays have been nice, but have conveyed a mild gaming experience. I guess the first two scenarios were designed in order to familiarize with the system. 
I feel that the engineering part of the game, while necessary because otherwise you'd move in too straight lines, really tends to make things more difficult since you have to proceed in what looks like a spiral manner in order not to destroy one's ship. Emersion sometimes may be the only good choice for systems which will not repair.

Innovative, intense, and very clever. This game is awesome. Once you play in real time it's in a league of its own. I would rate this game higher, but in order to really, truly enjoy it you need 6 people bare minimum. 8 to truly appreciate what the game has to offer. Everyone has a specific role and tasks to order, with 8 people everyone has 1 task on each side and when you start have less people they will have to take on more than one task. Which if you can handle that by all means go for it, but I've seen it become absolutely overwhelming for some folks.

Immersive realtime teamwork game, in a class that includes Space Alert and maybe nothing else.

I really like Captain Sonar.  I would buy it except I don't think I'd ever get my copy played.  It's intimidating at first but really every job is easy to handle once you learn it. So far I've been the radio operator, which I am quite good at, and engineer which I am not super great at yet. Real time is the way to go, unfortunately most times I get to play there are several new players so we play turn-by-turn which is still fun but not as crazy.

Playing time of 45-60 minutes...?  Maybe for the turn-based game, but 8-player realtime I have yet to see a game go more than 25 minutes.  This game takes a while to explain, and some players who try to comprehend it all the first time get frustrated. But one game in they're hooked. Extremely good balance of excitement and strategy.  It's a weird mix of party game, war game, and intense strategy.  Absolutely one of our all-time favourites.

I Love this game, but it is not for everyone. You have to have an enthusiastic group of 7 friends to play this game to its full potential. It is very easy to teach to two or three people at a time if the rest you have played before. It has incredible potential for expansions and variations. I'm confident that this game will spawn an entire genre of similar games. It is important to note that at the time of this writing the rules are unclear on some points. one of the designers Yohan Lemonnier has been active on the BGG forums and has answers several questions about the intent of some of the rules.

It's one of the best games out there right now. With every group of 8 I've played it with, it's always been a blast! While it says 2-8 players, 8 is really the number you should always play it with - but that does not mean this game deserves a lower score like some of the other reviews say. Only get the game if you have one or more groups of 8 to play it with, and understand that each game is always different and the meta game always changes depending on the map you are on. After playing it numerous times, some will say that the first mate has a subservient job, but I can argue that they have the important role of communicating between engineer and captain. They also have the power to alleviate a lot of stress on the captain by helping them out. Overall, great game. Will continue to whip out whenever 8 people are over.

There is a bit of a learning curb; it's best to play the turn-based version first to LEARN the game. After that you would want to play in real-time because turn-based defeats the point (it can turn the game into a slow game of inescapeable cat-and-mouse.)

Each team is [ideally] 4 people who are assigned a unique role. 8 people might be a bit rough to scrounge up, but the game should work with 6. (someone can double up on the 3rd and 4th role; they pay attention to similar functions and are not as involved as the other two.)

Note: The 6.9 rating ("not something I would usually be willing to play") mostly stems from my sour first play. We were doing turn based, I was captain, and the person teaching the game kept telling me what to do. It made me wonder why I was even playing. In the event that play with the "right group of people", I will re-evaluate my rating.

This game is solid, but would be much better if some of the roles were more interesting.  In my opinion, the radio operator and captain are fun, while the chief mate and engineer are fairly dull.  Still a good laugh, but falls short of its potential.

Great game, and unlike anything else in the collection. The real-time version is a lot of fun, and after a first learning game is how it should be played. Needs 6 players though, and a bunch of space.

Like: The teamwork across the different roles makes for frantic, and often amusing, games. The feeling of everything working well is nice. I particularly enjoy the role of tracking down the enemy sub, not sure anything else in gaming makes me feel so accomplished. 

Dislike: The pause and restart parts can feel a bit clunky, with confusion over if moves happened, and strategy talk creeping into game stoppages sometimes. There's a reliance on the other team not to cheat, which has actually been a concern once or twice.

Conflicted on this one.  The gameplay is successful at generating tension by brutally punishing bad decisions, and each game mode had to have been painstakingly tested for proper balance.  Top-notch components.

Truth is, though, my actual experience varied greatly. All it takes is 1-2 of the 8 people playing to have a lapse in their attention span to make things quite literally fall apart, and that is exactly what happened this past night. Nothing is less fun than re-counting segments in order to determine if the operator and captain segments match. Anyway...this rating could change after more plays; specifically RT ones, are logged. Will work on greasing how things are communicated in the meantime...

Chaotic real time Battleship. Requires a great deal of understanding with all players involved to fairly keep the game in motion. Nothing is worse than someone yelling "stop!" then consulting in silence for long periods of time. If that social contract is broken, Captain Sonar falls apart completely.

I'm disappointed with the rules which are vague and poorly written. My tip is to line up the radio operator with the opposing engineer for clarity. Also instead of saying "ok" everyone should repeat the captain's order. It's strange that the designer is a sailor yet went with such a casual approach to a very thematic design.

I didn't get this one at all.  It seems like an overproduced version of Battleship with teams.  Or Marco Polo without the swimming pool. The teams are unnecessary - only the captain makes any real decisions (and that's debatable).

RATING: 8
This is a fun coop real-time (preferably) I Sunk Your Battleship game.  Ideally you have two teams of four facing off over a screen strung out over the center of the table.  On each team there is a captain (who makes the decision about where to go next and to fire weapons), first officer (who decides which weapon systems to charge up), Engineer (who decides which system is damaged on each move and conducts repairs), and Communications officer (who is listening to the other team's moves announced as compass direction and trying to deduce their location from them).  When you play real-time it's very tense and exciting and you really have to think quickly.

RATING: 8.5
I find Captain Sonar to be unique, engaging and super fun, but have noticed some mixed reactions with the people I played with. Most really enjoyed it, but it's not for everyone.

I actually enjoy it best at six players, as the First Mate role is rather dull and easily managed by the Captain (it's more of a spectator seat, really). That's also the reason why I don't rate it a 10.

There are two teams, each controlling a submarine trying to sink the other. Each player has a role which controls a certain aspect of the sub (including one whose job is to listens to what the other team is doing). It's vaguely like Battleship, except there's only one opposing vessel, and both vessels are moving.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game requires players to state very clearly when they are passing information to the other team or just discussing/acknowledging stuff.  When trying to track the other ship, I found myself repeatedly asking whether the other side were saying compass directions multiple times in order to indicate that they had moved multiple times or whether it was because they were talking about one single order.  This very quickly ceased to be fun.

It's easy to make accidental rule errors, even in the beginners' taking-turns version.  These errors might not come to light until later in the game or maybe never at all, because things are being done quickly and secretly and without any checking by other players.  

Some of the rules are hard or painful to enforce.  In particular, the drawing skill test used when surfacing a submarine is awful;  If playing with anyone with even minor  motor control issues of the hand you might want to consider a different way of enforcing a time break.

And one final complaint - smudgy pens.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2016)

As is usual from me, I bought the game without knowing its nature. When I got the game, I realized it was from Matagot (thus it has great production values) and the game´s box is heavy (lots of components). I also realized it was desgined by Roberto Fraga, a game designer I respect a lot. All of his games are unique in some form and Captain Sonar isn’t the exception.

Captain Sonar is a very elaborate game for a party game, perhaps it is because it isn’t a party game at all. From the BGG wiki, party games has few rules and lots of laughs (and nothing like this happens in Captain Sonar). To me, it is more of a thematic/strategy game, but as of today, Captain Sonar is ranked at #17 in the party rank :/.

The rules are easy to teach, but as each player has a different function, the game explanation is longer then usual. You can explain it under 30 minutes. 

When the game was being explained to me, I couldn’t help but compare it to Space Cadets: Dice Duel , and in every regard (but theme) Captain Sonar is the better game.

The components and art are great as is usual from Matagot.

The theme doesn’t excite me, but it is ok.

I love that each player has a different role, so it plays best with 8 players. By far, the radio operator is my favorite role! Having to locate the opposing sub is so much fun, on the other hand, both captains have to clearly state when they are moving because a mistake here (that can happen very easily) can broke the game. This isn’t a game to play in loud venues. It is very easy to cheat (unintentional or intentionally) in this game and those mistakes won’t be noticed ever :(!

Captain Sonar comes with a lot of maps, but I have only played the basic one. It also features real-time or by turns play. I have only played the real time game and I enjoyed it (but I’m curious about the other mode, perhaps I will play it this way in the future).

You need the right group and the right mindset to enjoy the game

I really like that there is no luck whatsoever in the game.

Bottom line, Captain Sonar is a solid 6.0 for me. I’m still undecided if I should keep it or not. Team vs. Team often sounds great on paper but those games almost always tire me very quickly. I prefer it over Space Cadets: Dice Duel because there is no luck in Captain Sonar, only cooperation and skill. I want to play it again soon.

Played three times as part of an inexperienced crew against a bunch of guys who largely knew what they were doing  ... and got absolutely slaughtered every time.

Wasn't a pleasant experience, but I can see that with balanced crews it would be pretty good. The technical roles in particular seem to require a degree of experience to avoid preparing systems that can't be used due to system malfunctions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
- Awesome team experience. 
- It's a cat and mouse game, where you can not know if you're the cat or the mouse until it's too late.
- Plays best with 6 or 8 depending on the people, as the First Mate role can be a little boring if you're not playing one of the trickier maps. If so, combine the First Mate and Engineer roles - these are manageable by one person.
- Can also fall flat with a crap captain and/or sonar operator. It's a good idea to play with the strongest gamers in these roles first so any newbies have an idea of how they should play. Also gotta watch out for a Captain who micro-manages the Engineer.
- Teaching can take a little while as you have to teach all the roles separately. You may also need to re-teach these if you want to play again with different roles.
- Minor negatives aside, this is a fun game that can make for a great experience, with a story to tell afterwards.
- It also feels like an achievement when you all pull together to find, hunt down and destroy the other team's sub. Particularly if cop a hit or two in the process.

OK... I played my first and probably last game at the monthly Games Day.  We started out all right with alternating turns... seemed like a great little game.  There were eight of us and a referee.  I was Captain of my team.  After four turns the ref switched us to "real time"  and that's where everything I hate about co-op games came into effect.

It was total chaos... and not in a good way.  In order to do anything, you need information from two or three other sources and actual co-operation was not happening.  If played with sequential turns... I might be convinced to try again.  But in real time mode  I think a 3 rating (likely won't play this again) is being generous.

After thinking about the game for a couple of days, it would probably be best played in sequential mode with only 2 or 4 players... then I might bump my rating to a 7... maybe even an 8.  

After reading the comments for this game, I find that a simplified game for 2 or 4 players, 'Sonar,' exists... and that game would probably fix all of the problems that I have with this real-time monstrosity.

2016-08-30 - This is a great 8 player, team game (4 to a side). I only played it once, as the captain, but I think I would play and enjoy any of the roles (okay, first mate is a bit simple). It reminds me a lot of Space Cadets Dice Duel, but less dice is rarely a bad thing, and the hidden movement/tracking definitely distinguishes it.

Have to play a bit more to come to more concrete conclusions, but my initial impression of the game is that it feels a bit chaotic, even when playing turn-by-turn. Second game was much better with 8 players.

I'm not a big fan of real-time games. It's hard to ensure everyone is following the rules and it's even harder to get everyone to run at the same speed without everything quickly falling apart. Interesting concept though.

Prefer Space-Cadet: Dice Dual if I had to choose.

Rating might change after more plays... but initial thoughts are that it is one of the most amazing 6-8 player experiences board game players can have. If you have any fond memories of battleship at all... and you like board games enough to try out something heavier than Sushi Go or Codenames... and have 6-8 people... just buy this immediately. 

Do note that it can be very frustrating to be radio operator... make sure the person sitting in that chair is either fairly experienced at the game or just doesn't mind if the whole team dies because they sucked at their job. The captain has a lot to keep in mind... but just tell new players in that chair to take their time and all goes well.

Also, strongly recommend all movements be made using the phrase "TRAVEL NORTH" (or other direction). And then all action be done as "EXECUTE SONAR"... this helps as players often ask each other things like "Should I go North?" or "We need West" and those things will easily mess up a radio operator.

Like most Roberto Fraga designs, a very unique type game. I suppose one could compare it to Space Cadets: Dice Duel, but the fact that you do not know where the opposing team is located completely changes the game. 

Cooperation and communication really is key here. There are bound to be a few hiccups along the way - groups must make sure that they are properly announcing movement and such, but the experience would keep increasing in fun as groups get better and more coordinated.

Full disclosure - I helped proofread the rules and received an early prototype of the game. But Fraga is one of my favorite designers and I rate his designs (and all other games) honestly.

Such a game full of adrenaline. You have to constantly be on your toes, watch every movement, every step is important. AND YOU MAKE MISTAKES!! But so does you opponent. I don't recommend this game for everyone, but if you enjoy fast paced friendly competitive games, then this definitely is for you. When there are enough people in the room, I will almost always suggest this game. 
I have played every role. Most of the times, I was the captain, but every role is critical and enjoyable. Sharing information, sharing your plan, sharing your problems, asking questions,... Man, this game gets me every time. My biggest problem with this game is finding enough players.

Played once with 8 people. I was the navigator and managed to locate the other submarine instants after it located us.

Captain Sonar is easily one of the most, if not the most, innovative game to come out of 2016. It is such a brand new approach to a party game that I insist every collector have one in their collection. The only reason this game does not get 10 stars is because you need 8 people to play it to get the full game experience, which can be limiting for some game groups.

Fantastic game and wasn't as chaotic as I thought it might be. Definitely more tense than I had imagined and while we messed up a couple of rules around silence, which made the game last longer and become more confusing than we thought it should be, it was still a lot of fun.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely a unique game, it's rare that an occasion provides an opportunity to play this, but when it hits the table you can't help but play a few games in a row. It's best at 8 players, probably works at 6 players but I don't really have interest in trying it with less than 8. Every role on each team is very different and communication between crew members and the captain is so important. Each round start up pretty calmly with both teams moving around the map and gearing up for a fight, but the tension goes up so fast when the chase is on and both subs have torpedos ready to fire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
This bears a lot of similarity to Space Cadets: Dice Duel, which I prefer slightly over this. Both games are different enough that I'm happy to have both in my collection. I find Captain Sonar is a lower-energy game that's far less frenetic. It's still fast-paced and requires more deep thinking. I often feel like I'm solving a complicated puzzles on the clock.
As an added bonus, my 9yo son does pretty well as the XO when he joins in the 3v3 (4v3 with him) battles.

Ez a játék engem nagyon megfogott. Már a koncepció hallatán is izgatott lettem, aztán sikerült vele többször is játszani, és azt mondom, kiváló! Ráadásul mind a két játékmód kiválóan működik. Látom, hogy a 2 fős játék itt is le van húzva, meg máshol is. Hát igen, az úgy nem partijáték, hanem kimondottan taktikus. Szóval ha valaki partijátékként kezeli a kétfős változatot, akkor csalódás, de ha nem, akkor kettesben is kiváló, mindenféleképpen megér egy próbát.

A simple 1-vs-1 videogame distributed hectically across eight players. Nice and nerve-wracking, maybe a bit too much chaos in the real time aspect when the game is approaching its final shots.

RATING: 8.5
Captain sonar is a really good albeit a very niche game. It takes a very specific crowd of 6-8 people for it to really shine. You need to have people that are high energy and want to play. So if you can find the right crowd it is an unparalleled experience for a tabletop game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Definitely need to play it more, but the few times I have it was probably the most intense experience I've had with a board game. People are shouting and scrambling trying to find the enemy. It really makes you work as a cohesive unit to ensure victory. Would not consider this a party game at all though. Getting 8 people to the table can be difficult, but playing with 6 is okay. Radio Operator was my favorite role so far.

1 partida no terminada.

Son 2 equipos en el que cada equipo maneja un submarino y cada jugador se encarga de una parte del mismo. Por ejemplo, uno se encarga de dirigir al submarino (norte, sur, este, oeste), otro de registrar los movimientos del rival para intentar localizarlo en el mapa, otro elige qué armas o habilidades tener preparadas para usar, etc.

La temática está muy lograda y puedes jugar varias partidas con roles distintos, que cambian totalmente. El problema más grande es que necesitas 8 personas para jugar con normalidad (si juegas con menos, habrá jugadores que tengan que ejercer varios papeles al mismo tiempo). Otro inconveniente es que los jugadores deben ser legales, porque el rival no ve lo que estás haciendo y es sencillísimo hacer trampas sin que te pillen.

Buen juego para grupos grandes.

First Mate role seems a bit lackluster, but it does serve the purpose of smoothing Captain-Engineer communication.

[House Rule]  When playing Sonar (not Captain Sonar), use the Captain Sonar torpedo range (4 spaces) instead of the Sonar torpedo range (anywhere in quadrant).  The latter reportedly leads to submarines trying to straddle the quadrant lines.

We played the turn by turn version. This is probably one of the games that is enjoyable for one play, and one play only. Nonetheless, I'd be willing to try the real time mayhem once. First mate and engineer roles are pretty dull, and one can easily handle both at the same time, bringing required players down to six.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.4
Really intense game when played in real-time! Requires deep concentration and the rules need to be made very clear before beginning (I played a game where one team forgot a rule but I did not catch it because I did not see what they were doing behind the big screen). I usually don't like real time games nor co-op but Captain Sonar was fine for me because it made thematic sense and since everyone has their own tasks to do, it still feels individual as well. 
I have played both 4vs4 and 3vs3 and personally I didn't find the experience to be worse with less players. It was maybe even easier with 3vs3 because then the captain doesn't need to have conversations with the first mate anymore and can directly communicate with engineer and easily see his board.

I think Captain Sonar gives a great game experience but I wouldn't be enthusiastic to play engineer or first mate again to be honest. Furthermore, you need a big group that can play uninterrupted for an unknown time (our plays have lasted from 15 min to almost an hour). The rulebook could also be clearer in my opinion (even with the errata).

RATING: N/A
In Captain Sonar, you and your teammates control a state-of-the-art submarine and are trying to locate an enemy submarine in order to blow it out of the water before they can do the same to you. Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.

All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I enjoyed this game quite a bit with 6 players but it is basically glorified battleship. :-) The different maps and scenarios make for different games. If I knew I'd have a group of 6 or 8 that would enjoy this regularly, I'd probably pick it up. Instead, I'll just enjoy it from time to time with friends who own a copy.

Plays 2-8. We had the full complement of 8 players, so everyone had a role: captain, radio operator (listening to the opposing team's movements and tracking their location on a map), first mate (launching functions such as sonar, torpedoes, etc), and engineer (monitoring systems and recommending modifications to the captain's orders based upon wear and tear on sub). We played real-time and it was a frenetic race to find the opposing team's sub, while running away from mines, torpedoes and drones set on destroying our ship. Good game if you regularly play with a larger crowd.

When I have enough people (8 people is the best IMO) this game is incredible. The way everyone has to work together, the yelling, the whispering, the feeling of getting a direct hit on your opponent... It's near orgasmic to be successful in this game. And crazy how adrenaline-fueled it can be when trying to get out of harms way. 

I'm not sure how this game captures the magic of submarine fights... but it does. For me and my group at least. Highly recommend this.

Good game, but the fact you can (ok, should) only play it with 8 people seems like a huge disadvantage. It can also easily be ruined by other team's captain not giving directions clearly which has happened in one of our games. If any of that is not the case or an issue, it's a really good and different (in a good way) game to play.

RATING: 8
Sonar accommodates a large group well, playing up to eight players in two teams of four battling against one another to hunt and destroy the opponent’s submarine. There are a variety of roles to experience and great replayability to be had with this game, especially assigning players to different configurations of team responsibilities (not to mention the inclusion of different maps to explore). The game plays more like a shared experience akin to a fun, competitive team building exercise.

There is constant pressure to perform duties in real time which may feel intimidating to some. The non-turn based nature of the game created a few instances of confusion for us when determining the order for teams to take their actions affecting one another, though it was usually settled after a brief discussion. Communication is crucial in this game, and it may be hard for some to follow all the action which would be a hindrance to performing well.

What a blast! Sonar is a great reimagining of Battleship from the point of view of officers aboard one of the submarines. Sonar generates much excitement in a relatively short play time and has the potential for creating memorable moments which will be remembered long after the game has ended. While I’ve only played the group version of this game with a full complement of players, I can imagine that even the turn based one on one version of the game would be a rewarding experience. I give Sonar high marks for its positive player interaction, effectively sustained thematic atmosphere, easy to understand yet challenging game system and all around fun to play vibe.

This was SO MUCH FUN to play with 8 people.  I would never try it with less - which can make it tough to get to the table.  But for those times you have 8 people and wonder what to play, there is no question.  In fact, it is worth purposely gathering 8 people you know any chance you get.  It is THAT fun!

Before I explain the low rating, just to be fair, I should point out that of the five other guys I played this with, three absolutely loved it and the other two thought it was decent.  I, however, found little fun in the chaotic play of mapping the enemy sub's path as a radio operator, or trying not to stress out our own sub's systems by heading in the same direction too many consecutive times.  People are shouting and issuing commands, meanwhile I want to tell everyone to put a lid on it.  This is just not my thing...at all.  Kudos to the designers who seem to have struck a chord with so many people out there.  Unfortunately, I'm not one of them.

One of the hits of GenCon this year, Captain Sonar has completely killed Space Cadets: Dice Duels for me. It's almost like Artemis in a board game themed for Battleship, and it's great for larger groups, particularly ones that want to both yell and quietly pay attention at the same time. Because both of those things can happen at the same time in Captain Sonar. I also love how everyone has to work together because you really can't just do your own thing without hardcore screwing over your team.

This game is well designed and fun.  But you need to play it a few times in all the roles to be effective at this game.  You really have a difficult time knowing what to communicate at first.  But having said all this, it is an amazingly cool, quick playing deduction game, that is played in real time.  

The only issue is that you can only play this game at a Convention.  You really do need at least 6 to play and it is ideal at 8.  Fun but it is a tough one to get to the table.

The game has a strong WOW factor, but dies off so quickly that I can hardly believe any gamer would recommend this game as a regular collection if not for attracting new-comers. The game got repetitive easily as there is no random factor.

Really solid game at 8 players, not too bad to teach after having done a couple rounds but that's definitely the hard part here, it's tough to have a lot of new players in the game, but just play a couple times and everyone really gets into it.  Radio Operator is not for the faint of heart.

RATING: 8
My first play I wanted to be the radio operator.  I regretted that decision about a minute in after the other team's captain seemingly called the same direction multiple times for one action.  Every time I thought I knew exactly where they were, I was completely wrong.  I was awful; I was stressed out.  I felt like my team was losing and it was all my fault.  We did lose.  I'd love to play again and redeem myself.  Waiting for the next time I've got 7 other people willing to play.

Interesting game that's nearly impossible to get to the table. The conditions have to be perfect for this to work: a group of 6-8 in a quiet area without distractions. A fun time if you're the Captain or the Sonarman, but pretty menial if you're the other crew members. Kudos for being unique and I'll play if the opportunity presents itself, I just can't imagine when that will be.

Captain Sonar is amazing. Very simple at its core, yet frantic and horrendously stressful in the real-time version, but in the best possible way. Good teamwork is the crux of the game. Although it may seem like a one man show (the Captain) at first, every role is critically important, and when the game is going well everyone feels important, too. Can't recommended highly enough, although this is not a "casual" game by any means, and as such won't be for everyone.

Also, despite the 8 player version being the obvious way it's intended to be played, as a 2 player game it's also highly entertaining, and let nobody tell you otherwise. Essentially it becomes a super-involved game of Battleship mixed with Chess. Fantastic fun.

(9/16) 6. Very good, very stressful. My concern isn't getting the 8 people necessary to play this, it's getting 8 people willing to learn their individual stations.  Think it's a step beyond non-gamers which makes the chances of this hitting the table slim probably.

(9/17) 6. My initial feelings still apply.  Great, unique game, but just sooooooo stressful.  Couldn't play this more than twice in a row. :-)

RATING: 5
After playing it for a few times, the idea is fantastic but the execution is meh.

You are given one out of four roles but only two of the roles (Captain and Navigator) are the only interesting ones.  The First Mate requires no skill whatsoever and probably could've been taken care by the Captain himself, while the Engineer is a mixed bag.  I would only play this game if I was the Navigator, because there is a legitimate puzzle to solve that requires tracking information, deciphering, and listening to the opposing Captain at the same time.

Otherwise, if I had 8 people, I would rather play ONUW, Resistance, or Deception: Murder in Hong Kong.

I don't normally like real-time games, so I was pleasantly surprised by this one.

I enjoyed this okay, but boy my group loathed this one with a passion - two people on the other team up and quit in the middle, cursing the game. 

The issue is that some people aren't okay with the chaotic imprecisions in the game. The navigator on the other team was convinced we weren't giving them the right moves, often forgetting that silence moves would throw off his calculations.

You'll need the right group for this one - one that can deal with frustrations, chaos, and other people not doing what they they want them to. Your mileage will vary hugely with this one depending on your group.

A great 8 player game.  Everyone has things to do, playing in teams of two and payed in real time. It can get quite frantic.

Like battleship on steroids.  This game is highly thematic, with cat and mouse action between the two teams, movement constraints due to islands and wear icons in the ship.  Really enjoyable, and a great use of game time.  Packs a lot of punch.  Perfect with eight, but don't think it would be as good with fewer players (although 6 might work okay).

If there wasn't a copy of this already in my game group, I'd happily pick it up.

This is a chaotic mess, and it is so bloody awesome! Requires good teamwork and communication, since each role is fundamental and understanding how the roles function together is key to having crucial systems operational when they are needed, and knowing where the opposing vessel is, and being able to cover your tracks. Definitely recommended.

Captain Sonar is home to one of my favorite board game memories. Unfortunately not every round can be that round, but honestly it hits WAY more than it misses.

Bár volt egy olyan érzésem, hogy ez csak egy pimpelt torpedó lesz, de szerencsére annál azért jóval több.

Nagyon jól szét vannak bontva a szerepek, mindenki felel valamiért és kulcsfontosságú a kommunikáció.

Real time próbáltuk, nem a körökre osztott verziót, nagyon bejött, folyamatosan ott volt a feszkó, hogy mikor melyik oldal lesz seggbe lőve.

Bátor megoldás a törölhető filces kivitelezés, a minőségi paraván meg egymaga kiérdemel egy piros pontot.

Original real-time and team-based take on the classical submarines game, I give them that.

Haven't yet played real time, but did several turn-based 3v3s and could see how it would be awesome! A lot of fun, but in the turn-based format it felt like a lucky hit from your opponent can give away your position quickly, leading to a (seemingly) deterministic death spiral from then on... 

Looking forward to trying the different scenarios and playing in real-time!

Hands down the best 8 player game out there.

Love that this is a team game where every team member has their own role.  It's a fast pace live action version of battleship.

Basically "Artemis: The Board Game", except team-based and in another setting. Still an apt comparison in the sense both have, at max player count, a role designed for a player who wants fewer responsibilities to the point it crosses the threshold between laid-back and boring. Except Captain Sonar's first mate is not laid back at all in practice, because they feel like an artificial Chinese whisper fuse having to deal with the frustrations of both the captain and the engineer not being able the coordinate properly, while having very little ability to take any relevant initiative. I thus can't in good faith recommend the 7 or 8 player count to anyone. And since the very playable but vastly less interesting turn-based version is mandatory if you don't have enough players to fill both captains, engineers and spies, you easily see where the problem lies: Captain Sonar is exactly a 6 player game. My inner cynic is telling me that's why the first mate was designed in the first place.

If it were only for the restrictive player count, Captain Sonar could still easily find itself a spot in my library. However, for simultaneous play to work, systems must be put in place to enforce rules because nobody has the time to correct mistakes or, in less pleasant cases, detect cheating. Video games solved the problem by making a super-efficient entity, the computer, deal with all that fiddle. Board games however must find tricks. It might be a one-on-one affair on a limited game space where mistakes are easily spotted. It might be a playtime short enough that player elimination in case of an illegal move is not a big deal. It might be that the whole game is built around mistakes. Here you barely ever have to show your opponents that you're ever being honest; the theoretical social contract is that no team wants a cheater amongst their ranks. And to be fair to the game, I can't devise a realistic scenario where a group would draft a full team of them.

However in practice, the game is all about flawed communication, which implies nobody does remotely have any time to monitor what their allies are doing. So while it's not easy to cheat, the opportunity window is a bit too large for my comfort. The engineer can, by mistake or not, tick an icon in the wrong column and since surfacing erases the submarine's little snake path, if at the end of game the data from a team's captain doesn't coincide with the other team's spy, you'll never know if it's the spy made a fatal mistake or if the captain, unintentionally or not, mistranscribed a move, ruining the game for everybody.

A brilliantly fast, yet highly stressful game! Great fun and amazingly satisfying when it all comes together. It seems complex at first, but each player needs only know their own role, so it's actually quite simple. Each team controls a submarine through a non-stop, real-time game. There are no turns in Captain Sonar. Each team moves as fast as they can, whilst the radio-operators spy on the other team's commands to try and figure out where they are on the map. It's a cat and mouse version of 'Battleships' that is unlike any other game I've ever played. Definitely one of the most innovative games in the collection. The biggest downside is that to really get the full experience, you need either 6 or 8 players - Very little in between works.

Have only played it in Turn-by-Turn, but have been very excited every time it comes out. The fact we are trying to bring down the enemy sub, and really trying to work together with your team makes it that much more tense.

Very keen to play it real time but it is true trying to find 8 people is very difficult. Explaining the rules can be a little drag due to having to individually explain it to both sides players.

Played it but didn't enjoy it.  I guess depending on the role you get, it may be more exciting.  Overall, it felt as if two players took control and did the majority of the leg work, while others just sat waiting for the next turn or for the game to end.

This game will be hard to get to the table since we normally play with two, but it will be a go to when we get larger groups together.  This game is a fun, chaotic mess with teams trying to sink each other's submarine.  Each player's job is simple, but ties enough into at least one or two other roles that it adds some fun stress to the mix.  The game is doable at 6 players, but shines at the full 8.

In this submarine hunting game, players are part of a 4 player team trying to hunt the other team's submarine. The captain of a team has a map and plots movements of their own sub, and the opponents can hear the direction. The radio operator tracks the movements of the enemy and attempts to triangualte a location on a map. The engineer has to cross off systems (missiles, tracking, silent mode) as the ship moves in certain directions. The first mate can activate mines, torpedoes, sonar, drones or silent running. 

You can play turn based or in real time. 

The engineer has a map of the submarine systems and certain combinations of damage allow him to heal all components of a ship, so the captain has to watch for that.  Using sonar or drones, you have to deduce where the opposite ship could be located. 

I think it fits more into a party type game. It generally plays pretty fast and can get chaotic, especially in real time mode.  I think you can optimize the various roles, and it's got some neat ideas.  It's probalby best with 8 players.

If I have 8 people. This is the game I want to play. Plays better than I expected with 6 as well. Real time with good theme that gives you the feeling of a submarine battle. Components are good except for the dry erase markers which appear likely to need to be replaced with repeated plays.

One of the few realtime games I will play and enjoy. It still have all of the things I hate (general chaos, lack of strategic play, excessive screaming, etc.), but I like it none the less. Each role is interesting to play in its own way but my least favorite is Captain. I also think this game should only be played with max players. Having more than one role to look after is just mayhem.

Captain Sonar description:
At the bottom of the ocean, no one will hear you scream!

In Captain Sonar, you and your teammates control a state-of-the-art submarine and are trying to locate an enemy submarine in order to blow it out of the water before they can do the same to you. Every role is important, and the confrontation is merciless. Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.

All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.

Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous. In the latter set-up, all the members of a team take their actions simultaneously while trying to track what the opponents are doing, too. When a captain is ready to launch an attack, the action pauses for a moment to see whether a hit has been recorded — then play resumes with the target having snuck away while the attacker paused or with bits of metal now scattered across the ocean floor.

Multiple maps are included with varying levels of difficulty.

It confirms that I dislike simultaneous action games. I hated that as the radar operator, if I misheard or didn't hear one direction, it messes up my whole tracking and team. This could easily work as turn by turn simultaneously, 7W style and be easier to track and simpler and less chaotic.

Captain Sonar requires too many people to see regular use, and is a little half-baked. The game is essentially print-and-play quality.

The sonar position and captain are the only thematic positions and work together quite well. Engineering and 1st Mate are dull, less engaged with the hunt, and feel rather custodial in nature.

Its still worth playing, but owning it is something for game clubs, youth groups, etc., not individual people.

Party game geniale da giocare in 6 o 8 giocatori (io lo preferisco in 6 se non si è alla prima partita) cercando di affondare il sottomarino avversario. E' dai tempi di space alert che non giocavo ad un gioco 'live' così divertente e coinvolgente. I due equipaggi cercheranno di sfidarsi e di attaccarsi per scoprire e affondare il sottomarino avversario. Gioco di strategia e di squadra molto riuscito.

A truly remarkable 2-8 player real-time, hidden-movement, competitive, team-based game where the players are divided into two submarine crews and given unique positions on their respective submarines, then tasked with hunting down and eliminating each other!

If it weren't for how relatively weak and boring the First Mate position is, I would honestly give this game a perfect score! Other than that, every position feels unique and meaningful and can dramatically contribute to its team's success or failure!

Captain Sonar fue diseñado por Roberto Fraga y Yohan Lemonnier, y publicado en 2016 por Matagot. En la partida, los jugadores se dividen en equipos, cada uno manejando un submarino, que intentará hundir el submarino del equipo contrario. Cada miembro del equipo tiene un tablero distinto en el que deberá cumplir su función particular en tiempo real. El paso de los turnos en cada equipo depende de la orden de movimiento que da su capitán. El equipo deberá ubicar el submarino enemigo, aproximarse a él sin ser detectado y disparar sus armas para hundirlo.

Captain Sonar es un juego de reglas simples y partidas cortas. El desafío pasa por un lado, por que el equipo pueda comunicarse y coordinar su plan táctico con claridad y eficiencia, y por otro lado, por un juego del gato y el ratón, en el que con astucia y sangre fría se debe encontrar y asechar al adversario sin delatar su propia posición.

Captain Sonar es un diseño sumamente original que viene a revolucionar el género de los juegos de movimiento oculto (hidden movement), como Scotland Yard, Letters from Whitechapel, Specter Ops, Nuns on the Run o Fury of Dracula. Estos juegos son usualmente largos, penosamente lentos, desigualmente divertidos para cazadores y cazados, y complican las reglas para intentar simular profundidad en el desafío. Captain Sonar encontró la fórmula para proponer una dinámica distinta: ágil, colaborativa, inteligente y atrapante.

Best 6-8 player game I own. A great adrenaline rush when either you get a first hit on your opponent or they hit you. Don't think I've seen a game like this where all the players are all in, all the time. It takes a little time to get everyone up to speed the first time - but it's worth it. Once they're playing there's a lot of laughter and anxiousness. It's worth the effort to find at least 6 players.

A real time race to find the other submarine. Ideally you are eight, although it plays at less it is best with 8 so that the roles are spread out. You each have a task to prepare the equipment (missiles, sonar), navigate, repair or track your opponent. But it plays in real time so it is hectic and you must communicate well. As with other games of the genre, you must play with the right people as each player must pull their weight but be sure to have fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Captain Sonar is a real-time team-based game for exactly 8 players; comparisons to Space Cadets: Dice Duel are pretty apt.  On each team of four, one player plays the Captain, who decides where the team's submarine is going, and when to deploy its various weapons and scanners.  Another player is the first mate, who decides which weapons and scanners to ready first, each taking a certain number of moves to ready.  Another is the engineer, who takes damage on the submarine for each move, disabling these same weapons and scanners depending on where he puts the damage.  Finally, a fourth player is the radar operator, who tries to figure out where the opponent is by tracing the opposing captain's announced moves on a clear overlay on his map board.  At any time, the Captain can decide to surface to clear off the damage and re-enable all the systems, but their approximate location must be announced, and the players are given a tracing task that takes a while, as the other team is still moving and shooting.  My only complaint about the game itself is that the first mate role is pretty boring.  However, this is not at all my type of game, as real-time and cooperative play are two of my least favorite game mechanics.

I saw this game being played at ORIGINS the year it came out and was stunned by both the idea and the fun that people were having!This is battleship on steroids! A 4x4  team game, CS puts you under the sea as a team of submarine recruits, trying to outwit each other and be the first to destroy the enemy.  The captain plots a course on a map for the sub and directs all activity.  The radio operator listens to these cardinal directions from the other teams captain and plots them on a clear movable sheet overlaying the same map trying to determine the exact location.   The first mate keeps track of which ship systems are operational as well as damaged.  And the Engineer records sub break downs.  You play at a single table separated by a wall.  There are 2 modes to play turn by turn which is good to learn the mechanics... but the game is best in real time, with the aptian shouting out directions without waiting necessarily for the other team to take an equal number of turns.  it is tense and very thematic. Unique beyond equal

The turn by turn gameplay is fine but this game truly shines when played in real time, I suggest 6 or 8 players, anything less than that and one player has a difficult time with all the jobs he's given. I'm extremely excited to play the game with 8 in real time, I've only ever played it in a 2v2 with myself operating 3 stations in a turn by turn manner. While it was still extremely enjoyable all I could think about was how much better it could be with a full team of 4 members working together to destroy the enemy submarine.

I wanted to love this game, but there are problems with it.

The main problem is that unless you're the captain or radio guy, your contribution to the game is limited. That means in a six or eight player game, where there's an engineer and first mate, you'll have someone who is just checking off boxes.

I wasn't able to play the captain or radio operator. Playing either of those roles looks like it could be fun. In a four player game, the captain plays the captain, first mate, and engineer. That looks like a bit of cognitive overload.

Eines meiner absoluten Lieblingsspiele! Der Real-time Modus ist genial und setzt tadellose Kommunikation und Teamwork voraus. Trotz oder gerade wegen des dauernden Diskutierens, Brüllens und Mitfieberns hat man ein grandioses Erlebnis (allerdings nur für 6-8 Spieler). Leider kann die relativ hohe Einstiegshürde das Spiel für Anfänger/ ein nicht funktionierendes Team unzugänglich und kaputt machen.

Great game, plays well with 8, but you really need a good team of 4 people who understand each other well. Otherwise it can be a bit chaotic which may lead to rules being ignored unknowingly (or maybe the need for a moderator)

A different feeling cooperative game. On each team each player has a different responsibility to perform. Captain determines heading and firing instructions, and must be clear about it. First Mate ready the weapons and scanners. Engineer tracking damage to the various systems and repair. Radio Operator (the toughest role in my opinion) listening to the opposing Captain and recording headings to locate the opposition. All have to work together or fail together.
 
Very different kind of board game, reminds me of a cooperative video game Artemis which I've enjoyed over the years.

RATING: 5
My first play of this was great fun. It's a very cool experience. 

However, I'm not all that driven to play it again or own it. I'll happily play again, but I'm never really going to seek it out. For me there are a few issues that make the game a bit less exciting. First off, at least one of the jobs (First Mate) is relatively boring as there's not a ton of decisions to be had. Captain has lots more going for it. 

But a bigger issue for me is that there's really no way to tell if someone is making a mistake given the realtime nature of the game. Did the sonar operator mess up what he heard the other team is doing, or did the other team accidentally cheat in their movement? It can be very hard to know. Even with players trying hard to stay well within the rules may inadvertently be breaking one in the flurry of activity. 

The other reason I don't really love the game is that I'm not a huge fan of the way the sub breaks down and the engineer needs to do things. The great part about the game is hunting down the other sub and moving about trying to evade the opposing team. It is very fun to try and track down another sub, but the whole aspect of the sub breaking down and only being able to travel in some directions just seems annoying to me. I'd much rather have greater freedom of movement and some other job having to do with really making choices about what systems to activate and use. 

Overall I had a fun time and am sure I could again. But it will take a certain mood I think for me to want to play this and I don't see myself ever wanting to play this frequently. 

Update: Additional plays have cemented my feelings on this, and they fit the above quite well. When everything is working properly, Captain Sonar is an exquisite experience. It's incredible fun, unique tension and teamwork, and provides such elation when your entire team is operating smoothly and succeeding. 

However, the game can also break down quite easily--players can accidentally mess up their movement. One game it turned out the opposing captain said they headed west when he actually marked down East--which completely threw off the game. In others teams didn't work together well and were constantly trying to make and undo moves which lead to mass confusion and disagreements about what was going on. Perhaps playing with an experienced group that was well focused would make these issues go away, but because of the real time nature of the game, there is plenty of incentive for players to try to speed up to the point of haste. 

Ultimately I think it provides a very fragile gaming experience that only occasionally actually provides the exquisite highs, and all to often provides an annoying or wasteful experience ruined by rules confusion, communication issues, or flat out mistakes. I'll still play from time to time, but mostly it seems to be chasing that high from the few rounds that actually work, and hoping to avoid the lows it can provide.

Pros:
1. Excitement. This game is a real time game with lots of excitement. You will be yelling things like "Torpedoes Ready!" or "Systems not available!". So much fun.
2. Tense. There are moments in the game where everyone must stop while the other team launches torpedoes. That moment is very tense as nobody but you're own captain knows where the sub is.
3. Quick. The games last less than 15 minutes once you know how to play.
4. Components. The dry erase components are great.

Cons:
1. Player count. This plays best with 8 players. It's hard to get 8 players.
2. Teach time. The game is easy to teach, but you have to spend 3 to 5 minutes to teach each role. Then the next game every once to switch roles and they have to be re-taught. One time up front expense that's worth it.

Summary: This game is a ridiculous blast. If you can get 8 players to the table then it's 100% worth it to get this game. If everyone is scared of real time games, then you can play the turn based version that is still very good. But the real time version of the game is an insanely good time.

Fantastic with exactly 8 or 6 people, less so with other counts.

Really creative game that I could tell is well thought out. I didn't really enjoy the real time aspect. I really felt like I was doing a job, not playing a game. Again, I really respect this game but it is not for me. The fact that you need 8 players is another set back, but the main thing is that you are constantly in a time crunch with decisions that I'm not a fan of. I just wanted it to be over while I was playing.

A truly unique experience. People are calling it a real-time battleship party game, which makes sense, but quite plssibly doesn't give the game enough credit. The limited communication and frantic activation of systems is equally fun, no matter which station you are operating, which can't be said of a lot of games that attempt to provide a very similar feel. Plus, Captain Sonar manages to provide the total package without overcomplicating the rules. Easy to pick up and play with little prep work.

Intense.

We jumped right into an 8P real-time game, rather than doing a turn-based game as recommended for a first game.

We enjoyed it so much, we played 3 games in a row (changing teams/roles after game #2).

The roles are all fun, but not equally taxing.  You need to have a strong radio operator (to track the enemy ship).

If you have a large group, this is recommended.

I'm pretty good at telling if I'm going to like a game before I play.  Not always, but 95% of the time.  This is one I knew I wouldn't like.  I was not wrong - I very much dislike this one.

I found it stressful and annoying.  Stressful because any mistakes you make are going to be to the detriment of others.  Annoying because you have to rely on others, who inevitably make a mistake.  I don't like games that allow me to resent other players for their mistakes.

This game lived up to its hype. Very thematic, very player interactive, a lot of yelling and everyone gets involved! Can play up to 8 people, with no less than 6 being recommended. I have a large group to work with so we can get this to the table relatively frequently. If you ever wanted Battleship on steroids, this is it.

As with most realtime games, this won't cater to every type of player. Some will not like the stress or be able to handle all the things going on. For those players, the first mate is a great role for them to play as it requires the least bit of effort and the players can have a more calming experience.

A great social game - I traded it away because I wasn't able to get it to the table.  I had it in shrink for a year and a half after playing it at a game night a few times and loving it.  If you regularly have 6-8 this is a must have, but that's not a situation I think we see often.

Great game with the right group. This really is an eight player game and each player needs to be a good fit to make all of this work, but when it does, this game really sings. Radio Operator is clearly the best role for me. It feels detached from the rest of the team, but involves quite a bit of deduction and is a vital role. First Mate can be the weakest if the wrong player is there, as it requires someone who will take the initiative in communication and being an intermediary between engineer and captain.

This game is very quick. Much quicker than I expected it to be. I've only played it with 8 players, but I wager that's really the only way it should ever be played.

There was something about it that didn't quite satisfy me, but I'll need more plays to realize exactly what that was.

The game was a fairly fun experience, but it's not something I look forward to playing again. We played with 8 players, 6 of which were learning the game, and our inexperience certainly caused problems, forcing us to stop the game a few times to discuss things as a group and forcing us to restart a couple times before we made it through a game without significant mistakes. A game with this much coordination and secret information definitely needs to have more detailed information on the player boards for each role to make it playable with new players.

RATING: 8
The sort of game that has an excellent pitch, and gets people around the table excited. The turn-based version is really just a tutorial, and the game actually opens up in the real-time play. Unfortunately, while the game itself is very intense and fun, the ending is typically a let-down as half the players lose on a razor's edge. If it played in half the time it'd be great--people would immediately jump in for a second round--but at the duration of around 40 minutes it's a bit too long to saddle up for a second time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very fun and intense game that is very flexible as it can play from 2 - 8, but realistically you either want 2 for turn based or 6-8 for real time. Turn based loses some of the intensity, yet there is still ample tension to be felt.

This is a great group / team game for game nights!  Very fun to play and great design with in game thrills and tension.  On the downside, it may be a bit difficult to get the full player capacity of 8 (plays with less but not as immersive) together, it will take 20-30 minutes to explain and some patience to play for the first time.  But... it is worth it for those with the interest and patience to play.

Intriguing concept and I don't want to write it off. But after playing the turn-based and real-time versions, both of them kind of failed for us in practice. Turn-based was way too thinky and there's no reason it's not just a 1v1 game. Real-time was way too hectic, filled with fixing rules mistakes and mishearing the other team's movement. I would be interested to try it turn-based with e.g. a 15 second timer.

RATING: 5
Note: The game can really only be played with 6 or 8 players. 8 is much better than 6. Anything else does not work. My thoughts refer to these modes only.
Pretty good game with a great idea behind it. But it is very hectic and it is clearly not a good game for people who have trouble to concentrate in noisy, rapidly changing environments. To me, it was a rather frustrating experience. 
I was also a bit underwhelmed with the engineer role and the rules for this. It does not make much sense thematically and it is very hard to keep track of. Plus, the dilemma of having to damaging things when you really cannot afford to do so is a bit extreme for my taste.
Another thing that I did not like too much was the need to keep track of what the other side did. This includes keeping track of them fixing mistakes, which will invariably happen and is impossible to effectively prevent, unless you would have an umpire for such cases. In fact, this is the thing that tends to ruin the game for me: It is a bit on the complex side, people will make mistakes, and it is not really possible to do anything against this, due to the frantic pace of the game. These mistakes can easily result in one side getting an unfair advantage, which spoils the fun.
Needs to be played in simultaneous play mode. The turn based mode is boring.

It is a very unique game. Try, if you have an opportunity to do so.

An absolute staple of my games collection. I'll only every play it with 8 which means that it doesn't hit the table as often as I'd like, however each time it does it goes down a treat - been played down the pub on more than one occasion. There's often a bit of a rush to be the Radio Operator, which I think is the least stressful role and perhaps the most fun. And the captain often takes a lot of flack, which is great fun. Looking forward to trying out the expansions.

RATING: 5
Like most realtime games with communicatiion etc, relies on subjectivity and is vulnerable to sloppiness on the part of the players so I think it works better in the theoretical realm

However, it is "cool", if it was actually something I wanted, so I can see how others would like this game a lot. I'm not particularly interested in this sort of team game (splitting up responsibilities, with some players having much less to do than others, as seen in stuff like XCOM) -- and a spiritual successor to Battleship wasn't high on my want list either.

Individually, each role doesn't have much to do. The fun here comes from a sense of comradeship and excitement when you get a trail, but I think it's a novelty that wouldn't last long for me.

Coming from someone who has collectively played One Night Ultimate Werewolf and The Resistance over 150 times, Captain Sonar at 8 players is the greatest party game I've ever played. The game lacks a little bit of the excitement with fewer than 8 but still remains a blast

RATING: 9
My rating is based solely on one play and by the metric "ohmygod I want to play this again." I could see that number rating falling with repeated plays. That said... this was hella fun. We only had 6 players and half of us had never played so it was a bit chaotic. My sub never hit anything. The captain kept surfacing for repairs (when he wasn't ignoring me, the engineer, telling him the engines couldna take it. Cuz they couldna). We lost because we damaged our ship more than they damaged theirs. I still had a blast. Problems are: a) You need at least 6 players, 8 would be much better, b) You need fairly experienced gamers. They need to be people who understand game concepts and don't need supervision. Another slight ding, the game is very open to cheating. Both the Engineer and the First Mate's jobs are really hard (impossible?) to spot check. So don't play this with people you don't trust.

This is a game that my friends and I may not get to the table as often as we woul like, since we would never want to play with fewer than eight players.

That being said, this game is excellent! It's intense and sometimes stressful, but the game doesn't take too long and it's an absolute bast from start to finish!

It's very easy to learn/teach and yet still has a nice level of strategy. As soon as we finished our first game, we immediately wanted to play again (unfortunately we couldn't since it was rather late that night), which is a clear indication that the game is perfect for us.

I liked my initial play of this, but would like to have a couple of crews with some people that know how to play to attempt the simultaneous version of the game. I think the time pressure would make it more interesting and increase the need of cooperation, as the captain would have to rely more on his or her crew. Still, the tasks were interesting, and I liked how the roles worked with each other.

RATING: 6.5
This game is 4 v 4 (not sure what happens when you don't have 8 players). Each player on a team has a different role: steering the sub, locating the other sub, weapons, and the systems. Each role has a little mini game to play while you are trying to sink the other team's sub. It's all very thematic, but it's very stressful since it's real time. Also since everyone has a different role, it is difficult to help someone mid game. If I liked real time games, this would definitely be rated higher.

I've only played this 2 player (1 vs 1) turn-based. I was surprised that it's actually a really good game that way.

I bought it for the 8 player real-time mode of course, but I haven't had the chance to try that yet. I'm working on getting friends at work together to play sometime, and several people have shown interest. Hopefully we can get something going after the summer vacations.

Also, I'm going to Essen this year, so perhaps I'll find people to play it with there… :)

Interesting team vs team game that has real time aspects and cooperative play. The game itself feels a little bland and without a ton of actual depth though. A lot of the strategies seem to revolve around combining Drones + Sonar to locate the enemy and then just shoot them hard and fast. It is definitely fun though and frantic at times. If I'm in the mood and we have 6 or 8 people I'd definitely play it again.

Played with 8 players.  good game!  Advanced Battleship!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
NOTE: I have only played two player, turn-based games so far.

Ratings (1 to 5):

Simplicity: 5
--> A one-time investment of 15-20 minutes to learn all the roles is probably all you need.

Depth: 2
--> This is not a deep, thinky game, but there are a variety of approaches you can use in attacking and defending.  The relatively large volume of actions in a typical game (due to its relatively quick turn speed) makes up somewhat for this lack of depth. 

Player Interactivity: 4
--> Obviously you regularly react to your opponent's moves and vice versa, but there are times, such as the beginning part of the game, where both sides are kind of doing their own thing until enough information can be gathered to effectively guess where your opponent is.

Theme: 5
--> The mechanisms and rules tightly align with the underwater sub battle theme.

Fast-Moving: 5
--> From turn to turn, you probably will have a certain tactic that you are following at that specific time of the game, so the decision that you make tends to be obvious and quick.

Replayability: 2
--> The changing maps help but we are finding that the game evolves somewhat the same from game to game (using Sonar/Drone early to locate opponent, then building up Silence if you feel you are close to being found or building up Torpedo/Mine if you feel confident you will find your opponent first, then repeating this process if your opponent uses Silence to escape your detection).  Using the map with the additional scenario action (where they are pre-existing mines that can be detonated) helps replayability though.

RATING: 8
At first, I thought: battleship + space alert: no way.

Then I saw this game getting a lot of playtime and actually viewed some reviews.
While I'm still hung up on the 'realtime' I can see it work in this game, because of the sonar guy tracking the opponent. If you go faster, great but you are also giving away more information to the other guy. So while the faster team might have the upper hand when combat actually ensues, the slower team might have more information to fire the first shot. Great design.

All in all, interesting enough to warrant getting some playtime of this, to see if it is really worth the hype around it currently.

[NOV 2016] Played it, played it again, played it again and requested it the next day.
Fantastic high paced high pressure game which meshes excellent with the theme. We do have two copies already in our gaming group and it is a game to break out with 6+ persons anyway so we are more than covered, but now I want my own copy for the one time I would find myself without a copy and still having 5 friends around.
Simply that good.

tl;dr: [thing=2425][/thing] done right

Battleship is... not one of my favorites. Yet this game that is clearly based on that was so much fun!
So in this game 2 teams both command a sub and try to kill the other team. The fun comes from the fact that each team really needs to work as a team. Everyone performs a different role, but they must co-ordinate in order to be successful. Each role by itself is fine, but not that challenging, but the working together is what makes this game come together as a fun experience.
The first mate role is bot that big, so I would recommend this game with 6 players rather than 8.

Note: This only earns it's rating with 6 or 8 players. It much worse with 4 players.

This is like a party and strategy game put together. It makes your communication with your team very important, while trying to outwit the other team at the same time.

What sets this game apart from other similar games is the simplicity it has despite having a lot to it. Each role is essential even if at first it feels like one of the roles isn't as important.

Plus, the theme is insanely good. It bleeds through the game and every move you make is extremely important. Plus, the real time game actually works well, unlike several others I've tried.

Essen 2016. A great fast playing co-op real time game. And I generally don't like co-op or real-time.

Only downside is you really need to get 6, preferably 8, people together, and that's not always a possibility.

I heard about this game through the Co-optional Podcast with TotalBiscuit, Dodger, and JesseCox. They talked very highly of the game, and explained the concept, and I was immediately hooked. After getting it, it was definitely intimidating to start, especially learning it with only three people. Having two play-styles available (Realtime and Turn Based) was a huge plus, especially when teaching a full group of 8 the rules. It's kind of addicting with how intense the game can get.

Captain Sonar is a cross between Space Cadets: Dice Duel and Battleship. Each team of up to 4 players pilots a submarine with 4 distinct stations. The captain secretly moves around the board, effectively in a game of snake where you can't cross your former path. Each time the captain moves, the first mate gets to charge up the various abilities such as torpedoes, scans, and silence (moving without being detected). However, every time the captain moves, the Engineer has to cross off a box on his sheet. Depending on which boxes are crossed off, some of the first mate's systems are disabled. And the only way to un-cross the boxes is if the captain moves in certain patterns or the submarine surfaces (which partially reveals your location). Otherwise, you have to take damage to reset the Engineer's sheet.

The station I played most and found most enjoyable was the Radio Officer. His job is to listen to the other team's captain and try to figure out where the other sub is. You get the same map the captain has, but you also get an acetate sheet so you can draw on the path of the other submarine. By moving the sheet around the map and receiving clues about their location based on scans, surfacing, and their torpedo fire, you can hone in on their location and sink them with a torpedo.

This game is amazing and will probably be my game of the year. Let me hit on some of the highlights:
- Team-based game (there aren't enough of those, imo) where each player has a unique role
- The game takes literally 1 minute to setup and can be taught in 5-10 minutes, and each game only takes 20-30 minutes (a huge advantage over Space Cadets)
- Very unique gameplay with the radio operator and hidden movement

I feel like I could gush about this for a while. We played 4 games in a row and had a blast. There's heckling during the game (of both your teammates and opponents) and you can't help but discuss it afterwards, which is always a sign of a good game.

The only drawbacks I see are the player count (realistically need 6 or 8), the table space required, and the fact that it might be too loud to play in certain situations. I think this would be an amazing convention game, and is a must buy if you have the group and space to play it. I don't really have the space to play it, so I'm not going to buy, but I will suggest it at every opportunity.

A very different game, a very distinct experience that clearly stands out from the crowd, but also a game in which you (and everyone involved in the game) have/has to accept that mistakes happen. Either to you, to your coplayers or players in the opposing team. And that sometimes you win or lose due to the mistakes made. Nothing to be sour about, but this game's got an even bigger entry treshold than expected.
Not only will you need to find ENOUGH people to play with but also you will need to find the RIGHT people to play it with. 
Also, the included pens are crap. I just removed the shrink from the game recently and during my first game we discovered that two of the eight pens hardly worked at all.

RATING: 10
My favorite game of the season.  Plays great for 6, excellent for 8, and too-fun with 10.  Surfacing your sub is a really good idea, as soon as the other team gets your bearings--this wipes out your track and heals all damage so you're ready for a fight.

Your team of 4 works together to guide your sub in real time, seeking to destroy the enemy.  Real time rather than turn-based means that the faster you're able to move, the faster you can find your opponent and arm your sub for attack.  

The captain's job is to listen to her three teammates.  Yes, the final call to take the sub toward the enemy or flee is hers, but winning teams have someone who is good at listening take the captain's chair.  One teammate runs the sonar system, listening to the enemy sub to determine its location.  One teammate evaluates damage and communicates which systems are available for the captain to use.  The easiest job falls to the one operating the weapons/seeking systems, because she just advises the captain when the torpedo tubes are flooded and receives orders on what system to make ready next.

This game is really really fun.  I haven't played it that much, but I really like how it introduces the stress of real time strategy so effortlessly.

I have a hard time giving this anything less than an 8 simply because it is doing something I found unimaginable.  Two teams of 4 players are basically playing real time sub hunt against each other....and it mostly works, it's silly and funny and exciting all at once.

Yes, people are going to accidentally illegally confuse the radio operators, yes it's very possible that people do things out of order, or activate a weapon illegally or mark off inactive boxes illegally and there is no way to police it...but who even cares.

If you have 8 people and want to have fun for an hour or so this is an experience worth having.

Captain Sonar is a group game where players take on different roles on one of two submarines. The two teams are trying to locate and hunt each other down. There's a turn based way to play it, but mostly it's a real-time game where chaos and hilarity ensue.

In the game, the captain is deciding where to go and what to do. Moving gives your opponents information about where you might be. They track those movements on an overlay which they check against a map to try and puzzle out where you might be. Moving also lets you charge different systems, but also requires the engineer to cross off system icons, shutting down possible actions. If you cross off an entire group of icons, you restore all the systems in that group. Surfacing also clears your board, but announces where you are (and requires the team to do a drawing challenge). Once systems are charged and online you can do special actions. Like check if the opponent is in a particular section, force them to tell you either coordinates or sections they're in (one truth and one lie), move silently up to four spaces, drop a mine, or fire a torpedo.

This is an interesting game, and I like it, at least in theory. It's also a game I should never ever play. I'm horrible at real-time quick thinking games. So automatically I'm a handicap to whatever team I'm on. And I end up making tons of mistakes and feeling bad about them. I want to enjoy this game, but it's just not something I am competent enough to enjoy.

If you can get 8 people together this is an excellent short game played in real time. Tense and fun. Some roles are easier than others and the captain of the sub needs a cool head and has to communicate with the other crew members if you want to win.

Really enjoyable game. We played a few 6 player games and didn't find the joint captain-first mate position too onerous. The different roles aren't too complex and a mix of regular game and non-gamer friends found everything easy enough to understand after a short introduction round and some some player aids printed from the files section of this site.

The only fly in the ointment was the dried out pens supplied with the game. I'll have to buy some new ones.. Otherwise a great game.

Got a chance to test it. Everybody really enjoyed it. I liked it, but I must point out that it's a pretty "active" game : people talk, yell, laugh (a lot!). I'm more of a calm player, I like to think twice about my actions, and captain sonar was too fast for me I guess. I'll still play it, and probably enjoy it, but only if I feel like playing a fast, hectic game. And I don't always feel like it

1st impressions: Really good. I had high expectations going in and while it didn't quite get there I still want to play more. The game is a bit looser than I thought it would be (but with 8 people in real time I should have expected that!). It's definitely an experience that no other game can offer, but I'm not convinced that 'real time competitive' is a category that board games need a lot of.

You play in teams and try to deduce where the opponent's ship is. Every player has a certain job like navigate, find out where the other ship is etc. There's a lot going on.

The second game we played was 'Captain Sonar' which was very entertaining and a good group themed game about anti-submarine warfare where players have an individual role in the ship's crew. These are captain, first mate, engineer or radio operator,. The key to this game is communication. The clever mechanics mean that the captain must give clear movement instructions that the engineer must then decide which system suffers wear and tear each time they move. This influences what systems can be used at any given time. They are all linked and when the linked ones - see a play mat on BGG - are fully crossed out, they are only repaired by resurfacing, which alerts the other sub approximately where they are, albeit they are good to go. Hence, the more movement undertaken, the greater wear and tear to the sub. The direction of movement affects specific systems. Communication on which systems are charged is the responsibility of the first mate who must liaise with the engineer whilst the captain needs to do the same, mainly, with the radio controller, who must track the communications of the enemy sub commander's instructions to plot their movement. This is clever emphasis in my view and makes the game what it is. They must then advise the captain of the proximity of the sub to ensure a firing solution can be found! This is a real-time game, so co-operation between the players (crew) is essential to the success of the mission. Whilst our crew achieved this, and capped off at least half a dozen torpedoes and one drone, we failed to hit the enemy, who did, to their credit, do unto us what we failed to do to them. A case of so close and yet so far! A game I'd thoroughly recommend as it has a lot of player interaction which I think is key to the fun element of any game.

This game is a strange one for me. It was love at first sight, and after the first couple of plays I genuinely thought this was the best game ever. However after more plays, the game feels more and more flat for me. This is due to:
- Real time version quickly escalates into full chaos with many stops that break the immersion
- Turn based version just tends to go too slow
- Some of the roles are just uninspiring to play

This game certainly have it's placed on our gaming group, but I'm not that enthusiastic about it anymore. Still have the potential to provide epic gaming moments though.

Outstanding. Worth every bit of the hype. Played a 6v6 turn-by-turn game but I can't wait to try a real-time game! So much fun! 

More plays: People prone to AP can really kill the flow of this game though... Also suffers from the other players besides the captain (like the engineer) feeling like they're not doing a lot.

RATING: 7
This is essentially a streamlined version of space cadets duel, set underwater instead of space. To put it another way, it's live-action Battleship. Four player teams each pilot a submarine, trying to either to hunt or escape the hunt of the other submarine. The game is played in real time, with both teams trying to find the middle ground between being quick and being deliberate. Move to fast and you find yourself unable to do anything, as systems go down all across the submarine. Move too slow however, and your opponents will easily track your movement and sink you the second you surface.

The design is incredibly clever. Every system in each submarine slowly becomes disabled with every move. restrict your movements to a single direction (for the most part) and those systems auto-repair. Obviously you want to exploit that, to avoid surfacing. The thing is, moving that way is predictable. Also, sometimes the map won't let you stick to patterned movement. Things get in the way...then the damage piles up, making surfacing impossible to avoid.

I think my rating might be a little misleading on this one. I'm not a huge fan of big group games, nor do I particularly like team games. As such, I don't think this game qualifies as an honest 8+ for me, since I would rarely prioritize it in front of most games in my collection. Make no mistake though, as far as team-building cooperative games go, this is easily the best in show.

Speaking of [i]pure[/i] player interaction, [b]Captain Sonar[/b] is in the same category. In this game, you have two teams of submariners and each player has a role to fill. If you have all eight players then each player has a role, otherwise some players get more than one. You have:

- The [b]Captain[/b] who decides where the ship is going and when to use the different equipment.
- The [b]First Mate[/b] who readies the various equipment and tracks the ship's damage.
- The [b]Engineer[/b] who tracks the ship's damage and delicately balances that damage.
- The [b]Radio Operator[/b] who is listening to the enemy captain's every direction and attempting to track where they are.


Now the crazy part: you can play this game turn-based like a normal board game, [i]or[/i] you can play in [b]real time[/b]. Yes, you can play as fast as your team can move through your various commands. This is a high-stress situation, but absolutely a blast for the right players. It's also a game that's over relatively quick and suffers a bit from the Baker Rule (you should play a game n-1 times where n is the number of times you think you want to play it). However, it's absolutely fantastic and will undoubtedly remain in my collection.

Highly recommended.

Tons of fun, played 4 games back to back in one game night, all crammed into about 2 hours and 30 minutes!

Had full crew on both sides, very exciting, and everyone was eager to try out different roles. Played realtime for every game, minor hitches on rules for first game, but nothing that impacted the game. Instructions are clear and well thought out, and gameplay is diverse, cooperative, yet feeling adversarial. We ranted about it to each other for about 30 minutes after the last game before leaving. 

Definitely will bring to board game night again!

Team versus team real time attack sub dual.  No dice! Ship stations use dry erase boards and the sweet spot centers around the captain calling out sub movement and the sonar operator tracking the opposing captain's movement on acetate sheet to overlay the nav chart to resolve enemy location--no stress there-hah!  Fire torpedo 1... hot, straight and normal.  The engineering station puzzle is clever, accumulating system damage from ship moves.  Comes with several varying diffulty nav charts.  Adrenaline junkies get a better rush out of the dice duels.  I like both but this is my favorite type of real time team vs team experience so far.

Great theme, amazing production, solid game. Think turn-based or real-time "Battleship," with teams trying to sink the opposing submarine.

Rules can be a bit messy, and confusion will occur, but the concept is very unique.

Was really looking forward to this multiplayer realtime battleship, and volunteered to be the radio operator. But even when we knew for a fact where the opponent was, a torpedo hit nothing. I understand that I should pay for my mistakes, and there is definitely a lot going on, but there is no check if the other captain isn't making mistakes. And that becomes frustrating. Disappointing experience.

RATING: 7
Fun game to play with a group of 8. Might be just as nice with 6 too, but I've only played with 8 so far. It's chaotic and and noisy. This is a game about proper communication and a lot of things can go wrong there. My opinions on the roles:
* Engineer is a bit fun, but plays a critical role in the communication towards the captain and First Mate. Make a clear game plan on what systems to keep enabled and when you need certain repairs will help you a lot.
* First Mate I found quite boring. I didn't want to play that role at all.
* Captain is nice and you'll be in the middle of the heat of making battle plans, giving orders and trying to keep track of all things. Not really my thing but I can see a lot of people liking that.
* Sonar/Radar tech was the role I liked the post. It was really satisfying for me when you are able to pin them down and you cannot cause much miscommunication so it felt also the least stressful position to me.

There is one big negative I have on this game: The strict optimal number of players. I feel you really need either 8 or 6 people to play this game. Anything other is a suboptimal experience I think. You need to be able and wanting to organise the correct number of people to host this game. Therefore I see this game not hitting my regular gaming group as often, because the attendance is often variable around 5 to 10.

Minor smidge is that mistakes resulting in cheating can easily happen. This can really mess up the Sonar/Radar techs or Engineers, as those are the most sensitive to that. Doesn't have to be a problem in your games, but something to be aware of and talk solutions for various problem cases beforehand, such as when an illegal move is approved by Engineer and First mate, or when you attempt to fire a torpedo and actually being out of range.

Lives up to the hype.  What starts off as "hmm I guess this might be ok" turns into "I GOT THEM, GET THE TORPEDOES READY!" in no time.  I had a blast discovering I'm probably the most terrible radio operator that has ever played this game. It's worth setting up a game night specifically with this in mind. Some roles are much more fun than others. That and the ideal player count being 8 is what prevents this from scoring higher. Sure, you can play with fewer, but it gets a little TOO crazy.

Game mechanics are relatively simple with a touch of humour, making it suitable for a group of friends or an extended family. Player interaction is very high. In fact, the success or failure of a game depends crucially on the communication between the radio operator and the opponent's captain, followed by the captain with the rest of his crew. 

Artwork is simple and functional, while the game components are high quality. Scalability is not good, with 4 players very hectic and 8 players the best player count. Replayability is low as the typical game will see both sides aiming for the drone and sonar first, surfacing at times to erase previous paths, using silence to try and cover up previous paths, dropping mines along the way and finally the final showdown with torpedoes.

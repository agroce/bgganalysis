This is a really cool game BUT...in order to enjoy it you have to play it multiple times, you need knowledge of both the decks and the character cards.

FUN: it’s a a very interesting puzzle to figure out what to do between the cards in your hand, the characters and the cards already played by your opponent.

UNIQUE: almost every mechanic in this game feels fresh and they interlock well.

NEGATIVES: you will feel a little lost the first time you play this as there are many things to consider.

2pl, slightly asym, creature vs. townfolk; looks interesting (stranger things like vibe)

Really fun and thematic 2-player that plays like a tig of war at times, while other times you have so many options it is nearly impossible to decide!

Nice, asymmetric 2-player-game that plays within 45 minutes. Takes 2 - 3 rounds to get used to the various characters' different abilities and the flow of the game. Nice artwork, that works well with the theme. Various victory conditions make you try different approaches to the game. I would have liked more different cards for the creature better, I suppose, but the fact that there are only 7 different creature cards in multiple copies might have to do with the creature player's strategic options. 

Currently giving a solid 7 because I don't know yet, how well it will stand with multiple plays and because of the above mentioned limited card options for the creature player (most of the town player's cards are uniques) which may make the creature role less interesting over time (but doesn't necessarily have to).

Great theme, almost identical to stranger things. This is what I like. A small box game, quick set up, small footprint, fun gameplay that doesn't take a week to get through the rulebook. Vital Lacerda? Are you listening? You could learn from this designer. We played wrong at first, keeping hidden cards hidden for the entire game, and the card abilities will take some time to process, but this is a big game in a small package. Perfect for taking on holidays with us. I think the $45 cost is a bit high for just a card game, but then again, no wasted box space and my shelf is happy. Replayability with random 10 characters out of 18 will make every game different.

A very interesting tug-of-war 2 player game with a nice theme. I'd like to play more sessions. So far if I'd have to mention any negative aspects it would be the fact, that a single session takes a bit more time than I'd like for a game with a certain "swingyness". Loosing (after you know you'll likely loose) can take thirty minutes.

This is the best board game for 2 players I've ever played so far. It's A-W-E-S-O-M-E in every aspect! Great and inovative gamedesign, components quality and graphics. Intensive experience for entire gameplay.

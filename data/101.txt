I would not say this is a particularly good game, but we had fun playing it. The concept is simple, the card mechanics seem to work but there is too much on who gets to the first single tracked bend first. If your colour is not played in the first round (apart from by you) then you're battling to avoid last place. It is versatile, as there are several variants of game play.

RATING: 7
I thought this was a pretty good game.  The mechanics for moving are nice, and require a good amount of thinking, but aren't quite to my taste.

I do like the way winners are determined though.  The bidding system really makes the game very interesting, since you could risk a lot for a car, but if you can't get it to win, you could end up in the hole, which will just make things more difficult!

Played it with 4 people, and would most likely give it another go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A light race game that is best when kept easy and fun.  If taken too seriously, the game play slows down and it loses any momentum it had.  I like the card play to advance the cars.  The fact that multiple cars move on a play can take some getting used to for newer players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating is for 5-6 players.  Very tactical but fun.  This game has a lot of opportunities for screwage.  There is less direct interaction with fewer players so I don't know how it would be for 2-4 players.  But I love blocking a car and then forcing high cards to come out.

You can have multiple cars so be sure to bid, even on ones that you don't particularly want to keep others from getting cheap cars.

Plays well with 5-6 players.  Rating would go up by one for playing with kids.  Good for playing with children 8 years or older and they enjoy it.  The six year old that I played with wasn't up to the bidding for cars and figuring out which card to play but enjoyed playing with us.

RATING: 5.5
Easy rules.  Accessible for casual & non-gamers.  Unfortunately, aside from having multiple chicanes (bottle-necks), the tracks do not provide many tactical options.  There ought to be more corners where using the inside lane takes less moves than the outside lane.  

Also, I find the game to be somewhat annoying.  It's tough to deal out the screwage (take-that) evenly.  Most cards move almost all of the race cars so it's tough to be selective when you pick a card to play.  Often you end up randomly screwing people because they happen to be convenient targets at the time.  As a fix (or a style of play), my wife says that everyone should try to cause problems for the player to their left.  I think it's important to keep pole position away from someone who really wants it.  Additionally, being in the middle of the pack seems to be bad (high chance for screwage).

Thought I hadn't played this game, then as it was being explained it all came back to me.  Remembered spending entire first game frustrated by lack of control, and the second play was even worse.  Even when I had good cards, by the time it was my turn I was usually completely bottlenecked.  I can see why others might enjoy it, but I'm just too much of a control freak.

Even my wife played once with me and the boys. The blocking and positioning during the race is fun, and seems to have wide appeal. Sometimes players can give too much help to a racer by playing carelessly and giving him too much of an edge. The auction is important in that one should not spend too much money. Overall, fun to race to the finish line, but can be a little random with some card play that advances a leader too much.

This is one of the first games I bought and it's a good one.  I like the choices that need to be made when you want to move your car and have to move someone else's car with it.  Sometimes you have to be happy with settling for bringing your car in second or third if the only alternative is not at all.

Probably best with 3 or 4. With 6 the bidding for cars can become fairly dull (everyone gets one for $10,000 or $20,000). Taking advantage of the three colour-switching cards is vital and don't be caught out by holding on to your "10" card until the end if the colour-switch card for your colour hasn't yet been played. There is a lot of kingmaking, particularly at the end of each race.

RATING: 7
(Removed Switcheroo Cards and the Wild 10, prefer playing with Daytona 500 drafting)

The second of the Kramer racing series that I've played, and about on par with Daytona 500.

These games are fairly light and straight-forward: deal out a hand of cards that can move 1 or more cars, auction off the right to the earnings that cars make based on finish, and go off to the races. Because of the 6 cars present, these games tend to play best with 3, as each person can then have two cars.

Vis a vis Daytona, this game has a lot more nasty dead zones, because the track regularly narrows to only 1 lane, which tends to create a bottleneck effect. I'm not sure yet if this creates an undue advantage for the pole position and 2nd position cars, but it certainly seems like it has the potential to, as it can be very difficult to get around cars that are entrenched in the front of the pack. That said, I think there is an interesting element to the game because of that, where you might want to bid up the pole position car just so you can go first, and then, use that first play to help the other car that you bought further back in the pack that is your ACTUAL pick to win the race.

Anyway, light hearted fun, I enjoy it, and I don't have to cringe at the NASCAR logo and the dull looking oval track when it hits the table. (Though I still admit that Daytona could end up being a better game than this one is...) Best played with the drafting rules from Daytona 500. Works in mixed gamer / non-gamer groups despite the auction because the potential values of the cars is so explicit.

Very pleasantly surprised. I really dislike Formula De, and really like this one. I guess it's the card management that makes it. Sure, you sacrifice a bit of the simulation, but that always felt tedious to me, especially the massive boredom waiting for your turn (disclaimer: I'm not into car racing in real life).

Auto Racing: Wolfgang Kramer card system
Players are dealt a hand of cards which have movement numbers for one or more of the cars. When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom. However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.
Reviewer quote:  I prefer Race Formula-90 by a large margin. I also enjoy the Detroit games and leave Formula-D and Grand Prix/Thunder Alley to the kids.

RATING: 7
Lots of fun.  In the vein of similiar racing games where you auction off the cars.  Then each person takes turns playing 1 card that moves several of the cars.  Since this is Grand Prix (rather than say Daytona 500), it is all about the choke points...areas only wide enough for 1 car to get through at a time.  Can't really find much to complain about it.  Occasionally you get stuck at a choke point while other cars keep "cutting in line"...but that's a minor gripe and just part of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Players are dealt a hand of cards, each card features movement options for up to six race cars on the circuit.  You then bid for "ownership", or rather bet on, cars in the race.  The race consists of playing cards to move cars, in the hope your backed cars will win you prize money.  Clever, but a bit dated now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Unsightly production from Mayfair, but affordable and simple. It replaces some of the fiddlier elements from Daytona with different fiddly bits. The two are about equivalent, but the all-or-nothing choke points on both of these tracks leads to meaner games. Hence I am better at this, but somehow find it less of a puzzle than the classic Daytona 500.

Better than I recalled, which may indicate I'm in a nicer group of gamers these days. Familiar mechanisms, and an auction each round (I'm terrible at auctions and this uses the worst form of auction). But the actual racing went very well and the two tracks made it a fun event. Unlike Ave Cesaer, the card mechanism means that if someone is blocking you, can might be able to move them first, still allowing you some movement for your car. A good game, but very samey to most other horse/bike/car racing games.

Played 1 time. Played two weeks after my first game of Daytona 500. Obviously very similar, being in the Kramer racing series, but I think I prefered Daytona. Detroit-Cleveland has brutal artwork, and the twisting track seems to cause massive blockades for turns at a time that will kill other players, where Datona's oval makes it a little more of a level playing field. Both fun, but Daytona has nicer graphics, better track for the sake of gameplay.

Game-wise this is an excellent racing contest.  The rules are simple and the mechanics are such that the races are always pretty close.

Clip-art and stock photography never looked so bad since Sim City the Card game.

Shares the card system of Daytona 500 which is lots of fun.  I like this as well as Daytona 500 and it's easier to get.  Good fun for the money and great for family gaming.  We don't use the switch cards, don't use the 10 wild card because it's pretty swingy (we will try auctioning it off as some people on the geek suggested), and don't play a persons cards when they're out of the race.
I'd rather have a couple cars not cross the finish line than have big kingmaker situation at the end by someone who has already finished.  We also allow wild cards to be played even if a car can't use every bit of the movement allowance.  That's the mix of optional rules that has been best for us so far.

Despite all the info above, it's a very simple hand management game with a couple auctions and good tension as well.  I'm not a fan of race games but I really enjoy this Kramer system.

Fun race game of card management. Easy to learn and playable from 2-6 players. I usually just play 1 race as a filler instead of the suggested 3 races. I haven't played Daytona 500 or Top Race, but I really like the blocking aspects of this one.Easily the ugliest game in my collection. Normally I wouldn't deduct rating points for looks, but this one is bad. Really bad.

Holy crap, I'm not one to bash a game entirely on its production values, but this is ridiculous. The board is awful, the box and insert are even more horrific, and the cards are thin, you-can-tell-they'll-wear out-quick kind. Comparing the quality against Daytona 500 is a joke. The game plays very similar to Daytona - players are dealt cards that move one or more cards. Players bid for cars. Top finishers get cash payouts. Top cash after three races wins. I don't like the switch cards - too gimmicky. Daytone 500 is cleaner and has far better production values. If you must have a Kramer race game, go get Daytona 500 and forget that this game exists.

RATING: N/A
I've only played the game with six players, so all of the following comments are for that number only.  This comment is also a work in progress (and seems more like a review...)

The basic flow of the game is get a hand of cars, bid on a car based on what's in your hand, use your hand to move your car (and others), hope your car finishes.  Each card has a number of movement points corresponding to certain colored cars. For instance, a card may have 6 movement points for Red, 5 for orange, 4 for blue, etc.  When a card is played, each colored car moves the number of spaces assigned to it.
Its unlikely your hand contains enough movement points to push your car to victory on your own, so you need help from the other players.  With luck, you'll get moved by someone else early, putting you near the front of the race and  more likely to be able to cause or avoid roadblocks.  Going last and having little outside help basically determines the first half of the race for you.

Some cards have movement points for a wild, which can be any color not already on the card and the full movement must be taken by the color chosen in order to use the card.  I'm not sure why the designer chose to force full movement of the wild, but what I witnessed was people behind a choke-point wouldn't be able to move themselves 4 instead of 5 with their wild, when that was their best option.  Instead, this resulted in playing cards that weren't very good for you.  In effect, this hurt the players who were trailing in the game, which seems like bad design.

Speaking of choke-points, being the person causing one is hugely advantageous, but also hugely out of your control.  When you start a traffic jam, the people behind you have the option of moving cars incrementally, throwing away cards that don't help them or the person in the lead, or moving the person in the lead to clear the jam-up.  Only the first option doesn't help the person in the lead, and eventually the people behind the jammer will have to do one of the other options, and so again the person in front gets an advantage.  That wouldn't be bad unto itself, but having the cards necessary to create roadblock is a random event, and so you can't plan for it.  

The color swapping cards were basically pointless and simply clogged your hand.

With six players, I never felt like I had any control of my car because between my turns the state would be drastically changed.  This in turn meant I shouldn't bother looking at my cards until I was up.  Picking a card to play isn't difficult per se, but the choices aren't immediately straightforward and so what is a pretty light game goes slower than it should to keep the game interesting.

The strategy seems light in the game, but I was convinced by other players that there definitely is some.  The biggest is card conservation and the timing of the personal 10 spacer.  Otherwise, the game is mostly tactical play.

I didn't think the auction really affected the game that much.  Most often, the bids topped out at $30, and at least a few people would get cars for $10.  Now paying $30 and getting last place isn't great, but its not that different than paying $10 and losing.  On the other hand, paying $30 and winning $200,00 is a HUGE difference, and so makes sense to pay the money for the car you want.  It could be that with six players there isn't really a fight over particular car colors, but I'm not sure.  This is certainly my fuzziest thought about this game, and should probably be ignored until I tighten it up.

The game also has a huge kingmaker component and could promote meta-gaming or collusion, possibly subconsciously or only perceived.

I think playing with less players controlling more cars would be an improvement.  Another option would be to bet on cars rather than own one, which I think would psychologically downplay the randomness of the game.

RATING: 6
A nice double-board implementation of the Formel 1 system from W. Kramer is hampered by the idiotic "switch" cards as well as payout amounts that discourage bidding. Throw out the switch cards & use the payout chart from Daytona 500 to make for a MUCH better game.

Enough about Daytona 500.
The groupthink on Daytona 500 being a better game is way overdone.

This game is just as good, if not better with the chokepoints, and you don't have to ebay it.
Easy to play; fast; extremely interesting

Haven't tried variants with different uses for switch cards yet, but they seem like they would add to the game.

Also want to try using Top Race betting variant at some point.

Excellent game. I like it a little more than its older brother Daytona 500, Milton Bradley really made a mistake by not publishing this game also.  The mechanic is very innovative.  Each player is delt cards that have movement instructions for one or more cars.  You play one card per turn. The game is three races and the races are one lap. The components and board are very good in appearance and quality.

Racing game that uses cards to control movement of the various cars. Each card has a series of cars it controls and movements that it offers. Careful planning is needed to play the right cards at the right times to move ahead relying just a bit on others to help move your car as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A really nice little racing game. It's actually more of a hand management game, where the cards you play determine how far all of the cars move, including your opponents' (you want to play the cards with the largest moves for your opponents when they're boxed in). Just relaxing fun, really.

Just haven't been able to get into this one, although I can't put my finger on exactly what the problem is.  I'm not very good at gauging how much the cars are worth during the bidding rounds, so it feels like a crap shoot.  I much prefer Formula De if I feel the need to play a racing game.

RATING: 7
Like Daytona 500, Kramer has taken a racing game and made it a card management game driven by position and timing of card play.

Unlike Daytona 500, where the oval is relatively broad and difficult to block, the Formula 1 tracks in DCGP allow for and encourage blocking to tactically help secure a lead, and also to give added leverage to force cards beneficial to you (that move your cars forward) out of the hands of the other players.

I like the added strategy, even though it drops the nice drafting rules.

I am starting this at a 7 on a 1st solo 3-player game, where I omitted both the wild-10 card and the switch cards from play, per frequently posted house rules for DCGP.

I think this may end up ahead of Daytona 500 in the long run- my Daytona 500 game had one clear winner, this one was a closer, lower scoring competition all the way through, and made it the game play a bit more exciting.

First played Sept 3rd, 2008. Taught in 5 min, played in 90 min with 6 players. It has a good theme, luck, and strategy mix. Each player starts with $200,000 and you bid on cars (one at a time) in the race based on your hand. The highest bidder gets that car (and a card with 10 space value for that car) and then you bid on the next one. If for some reason everyone passes, that car goes under the stack and comes back up if you have enough players. The first car (pole position) goes first. Each player in turns must play a card from their hand. Each card has one to 6 dots on them with a car color (or white which is wild/any car) with a value 1-6 on them. This value is the amount them move. You always move the top most first and in that order. If that car can't move it is skipped. The wild cards must be use completely and must be used if they can(on cars still in the race). The first one to the finish wins the heat (in Detroit) and get paid for your finish order. You race on Cleveland next and the last place owner picks the final side. Player with the most money at the end, wins. For the auto fan, this is an interesting one to try out and is quite fun.

A good car bidding and racing game. First you start with bidding on cars and pole position. You then race the cards around the track with the cards in your hand while trying to mess with the other cars ,by blocking them in or making them take the long way around a curve. On the third round the player with the least amount of money gets to pick what track you play.

This racing game involves an auction for which car you will use after seeing the cards that you have to advance the cars.  Most cards include multiple cars that you must advance, so it is difficult to advance your own car without helping others.  The white 10 card is overpowered and unbalances the game, so I would recommend playing without it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
One of my favorite games. This game has stood the test of more plays, and I still really like it. I love Settlers of Catan, but I'd rather play this. I played with my family, and everyone seemed to understand, and at least enjoy it a bit, and that's something of a miracle.

The game is quick to explain, and there's enough downtime to get some conversation in. There's enough strategy to make it fun, but not so much that you can't just 'play' the game.

This is an okay light racing game. I think betting on cars to win rather than buying cars at auction to own would make the race more interesting. Secret bets would probably be even better.

I can see how this could have been considered a really good game when it was published, but there are much better racing games out there now.

I really like the combination of the auction with the racing. I'm not sure that the auction actually enhances the game, but I dig it nonetheless.

I don't really see how there's much room for skill in this game.  The card draw seems to generally determine how well you can do, and other players moving your car for you can create some chaos.  Still, it is light and enjoyable.  It's fun to try to cause a logjam on the corners.  I think this is the type of game that needs to be played as quickly as possible.

RATING: 4.6
Too long. Your decisions are pretty much determined for you each turn based on the placement of the cars. Plus you can't plan moves ahead because the board will have changed too much between turns, so the resultant A.P. prolongs the game even further.

RATING: 7
Entertaining car racing game where you play cards that often move several cars, so you have to play your cards strategically to get the best results for your own car and the worst results for your opponents.  Racing games are generally not a genre I like, but this is probably the best racing game I have played.

RATING: 7
Fun filler. However, plays too long for what it is if you race all 3 laps. Lots of luck in the draw of the cards. I like some luck thrown in, but this was too much. Did not like the way  players already finished continue playing cards, as they can then choose who finishes next.

Excellent racing/betting game from Kramer.  In this particular one, the blocking can be particularly nasty as the tracks are very narrow with quite a few places where cars come to a sudden stop and the morass is hard to move through.

I'm a big Formula De fan, and so this was a "curiosity" buy.  I didn't know what to expect.  It has some simularity to Winner's Circle, as you get to move all the cars to your advantage.  However, while the mechanic was kinda fun, it just didn't have the "pacing" of a real Formula car race.  Maybe it was because sometimes the cars don't move as a result of being blocked.  Cars in racing games should move.. preferably fast!  :-)  Anyways, not the absolute best racing game, but a nice game overall.

Fun horse racing game (themed as a car race... which makes no sense). Really don't like the bidding for the car with money, which clashes with the tactical feel of the race -- would've rather bid with the cards themselves or some such. Can be prone to downtime, especially in the first few turns as the number of options is unusually high.

RATING: 2
Terrible. It is a car-race game: players are dealt a hand of cards with which to move cars around a racetrack: each car is colour-coded, the cards show which cars move, how far, and in what order. There are many choke points, which enable "strategy". By far the best strategy is to go first. After seeing their cards, the players bid for colours. It is possible not to bid for any colours, and play your cards to cause maximum frustration for the other players. You may also play completely randomly and be amused by the reaction from other participants. But the usual idea is to win with your colour (or colours, if you win more than one auction). You get prize money for winning or placing. The game is won by the person with most cash at the end.
As noted earlier, the best strategy is to lead into the first choke-point, then allow everyone behind you to develop high blood-pressure as the futility of the exercise is made plain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not a bad light racing game.  Could add some more races to make a longer game (or start with less cash).  Similar card movement mechanism as Ave Caeser but have to move other tokens as well.  Pretty clever.  Nice filler.

I played this a lot in my early gaming career not knowing much better. You'll rarely have enough oomph to get you all the way around, and you certainly want to keep your best cards for the end when no one will be wanting to help you along. So the winning strategy is to be lucky in the early game when people move you along more than others, or move you into a position where you can be first into a chicane and force other people to move you along. It's more fun with the kids than with grown-ups now for a couple of reasons, being turns take forever while you assess all your cards (the antithesis of a race game) and there's king-making galore on who you allow ahead and who you hold back with the cards you play. Not much fun as a result.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play: You auction for a car and then play your hand in order to get the car to the finish line first to win the most money. The strategy is in the cards as they often move many cars so you need to play your hand to move yours the most and waste the other cars movements when they are blocked and cannot advance. There is also three catch up cards which are quite strong. I was surprised that it was more fun then the initial instructions made it seems.

Didn't really strike me.
The auction mechanic doesn't work as well as the it does in Win Place Show. I suppose it is the owning and the betting component that works there.

Quick card game that's a nice filler and appropriate for non-gamers. Cards move one to six vehicles a number of spaces on the track. The catch is that the active player moves all the cars, not just his own, and can therefore stick it to other players. The full move or no move at all option provides a level of strategy to card play. Prefer Daytona 500 overall, but this is a lot of fun.

Recently upped my rating to 8 because my daughter loves to play this game, and as a result, I do too.

As a game for adults, this game is mediocre.  However, using the variant Doug Palmer (aka Scammer) suggested for playing with his young son (in the thread "Light Review with modified rules for 5 1/2 year old son") - its a lot of fun if you have small boys (er, or girls if they like racing car games).  My sons, 4 and 7, have a blast with this game using Doug's variant.  We pick some sort of prize (e.g. crackers like Doug suggested, or M&Ms, or whatever) and the boys have a lot of fun.  My four year old has had me playing it so much lately its starting to drive me a bit nuts, but he's having fun and its developing his love of games so I can't complain.

I really like this game.  The card management system combined with the screw your opponent factor that the tight, bottleneck prone track creates really makes for a fun game. 

The player interaction that this game has created in my group is a long way ahead of that of Formula D. I recognize that the auction/ card mechanics of Detroit-Cleveland are vastly different then the dice rolling used in Formula D, but when comparing racing games Formula D is the obvious choice.   

Once you've experienced the emotion produced by the screwing over that occurs during the last round of the race combined with the game's low price point, you have a real winner.

Highly recommended.

RATING: 6
A fun, thinky racing game.  It can be hard for new players to know how much to bid.  If one player does really well the first race, they can have a big money advantage that can be hard for the other players to come back from unless they force the bidding high.  
On another play, I have decreased my fondness for this - it's just very dry.

The card based movement mechanism isn't one that gives me the feeling I'm racing so much as playing my hand of cards. It doesn't inspire much excitement and doesn't simulate a car race very well. I'd prefer Formula De over this with its dice based push your luck, but only just. Perhaps there are better car racing games out there - Lamborghini? In any case, if you're looking for a similar mechanic that'll give you more fun then I can suggest Ave Caesar.

Not quite as clean as Daytona 500, but still pretty much the same game.  The card breakdown is different, and I'm not sure what the ramifications are.  Would be interesting to combine all the different rules into a generic "Kramer racing" kit... using Pitstop tracks, of course.

Not a racing sim.  Rather, it&#039;s a good card game that revolves around timing decisions - when to boost your own cars and when to sluff a card to keep your opponents&#039; cars in your dust.

RATING: 5.5
Rating is because I can't decide between 5 or 6.  I think the basic mechanism in the game -- car movement through cards -- is quite interesting.  However, it doesn't really seem to work in the context of Formula 1 -- at least not for me.  It makes the races seem much more chaotic than they ever really seem.  However, when the same mechanism is used in Daytona 500, I think it perfectly fits the Nascar theme.

Decent if strange racing game. Remniscent of Kniza's Motor Car Racing game where players play a card which moves one or more cars. The weird thing is bidding on cars at the start. Players get money for placement and the one with the most cash after three races wins. Easy to play but there are some tough decisions to make (hand management) as the tracks can be brutally hard (lots of blockages).

However, players are sometimes gifted with a win because someone plays a card that helps them...there's a little control but still feels like luck can play a big part. Also, the 10 card is a little strong too. Fun.

Another Wolfgang Kramer card-based car racing game involving hand management for movement and bidding to buy the cars.  It's like WK's Daytona 500 (Milton Bradley), but with narrower track 'choke points' (chicanes), no drafting rule, and a few cards that reverse colours for a turn for the purpose of car movement.  And 2 Grand Prix circuits, not just one track!  I like Daytona 500 better, I think, 'cos it feels more free-wheeling, but DCGP is still interestingly different and a good game to play.  I like having both, as Daytona 500 is easy to introduce players to, and just relax, and DCGP provides a variation on the same theme but with a significantly different feel to it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.7
I expected to like this game more than I actually did. 

Each of 3 races starts by dealing the cards out, then auctioning each of the cars off (along with starting position). The cards move 1 or more cars, in a specific order and various distances. The race course has several choke points, with only one lane -- part of the strategy is to waste other cars' movement points by trapping them behind immobile cars at choke points. The race ends when all cars have crossed the finish, or all cards have been played. You get a payoff based on place in the race. The player with the most money after 3 races wins.

The game seems like it ought to play quickly, although my first game (with 6) dragged on way too long. I also didn't like the almost random targeting of a player to get screwed over in the movement -- it just seemed too arbitrary and very frustrating. And the game felt way too chaotic, with little real control over how well my car would perform. I'd like to try playing with fewer players, but I doubt this will end up being a favorite race game for me.

The same card system as Daytona 500, but you get bottle-necked turns and switch cards instead of the more open Daytona track and its streaming effects.  Card getting stuck with nowhere to move reminds me of the freeways out here in sunny So Cal.  Both games are so much fun!  I want to get both, actually all three including Top Race.  My ratings for both games might actually rise upon further playings.

I'm rather suprised I enjoyed this. I'm no fan of motor sports, but I find Detroit-Cleveland to be a nice middle ground between the one-dimensional lightness of Ave Casear and the fiddly slog that is Formula De. The incoporation of bidding for racing colour, most-money winning conditions and the clever cards that require you to move a series of cars all add up to an interesting game. I actually appreciate the butt-ugly artwork: I can make people think I'm slumming it, before revealing it was designed by Wolfgang Kramer.

First of all, do not underestimate the bidding phase.  You can loose or come in behind and still win the game just by being frugal or calling other people's bluffs in the bidding round.  That said the game is fun.  With two racing track, fun bidding, wilds, drifting, boxing other players ahead, and those crazy times where you use your extreme boost to pull ahead at the right moment makes this a fun game.  You could be doing well then all of a sudden be overtaken.  One thing I recommend is to play with out the car swap, aside from breaking the laws of physics, it means you can work hard to get into first and then have the last place car swap with you, seems a little unfair.  You could play this way if yo want a really cat and mouse kind of feel, where no one wants to pull ahead, and it is nice that the option is in the game, but I don't recommend especially with new players.  All in all, a good racer,

A fun little race game where the biggest problem seems to be that, for an auction game, the best plan is often to not buy anything until the end when you get the last placed car for $10k. With $200k for the winner, this is an unbeatable ROI.

Plays quickly; it quite fun with a good amount of Ave Caesar style screwage, it just needs that third track in the box to make this the Ave Caesar killer...

Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix looks like a refreshing approach to a racing game:  no dice, and the cardplay implies strategy.  The reality is rather lackluster, because the only real decision happens before the game begins, and that's how much you're willing to spend for your car.  After that, cardplay is painfully obvious.  After much chaos, you either make it, or don't make it, to the finish line.  The vibrant art and multiple wagers in Top Race catapult the gameplay forwards.

I'm liking this game quite a bit.  Played it about 10 times now and I think the best I've done is tie for 2nd place in most money but that's cool it's always a lot of fun and there's a ton of DPR (Dickage Per Race) so you always have a good time there. 

UPDATE: I now own Top Race and with the bidding mechanic included I have to say this one drops a bit in rating. 

So much of this game depends on working with other players. If it's straight up head to head play it just doesn't play out like the same game what so ever. This game needs to be a 4 player minimum game and 6 player optimum game. Same goes for the other games in this series.

I've only managed a single (3 race) game of Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix, but I liked what I saw.

The game combines card play with a few simple betting mechanics in one package, and is very easy to learn.  Some subtle strategies help the whole affair along, and the pacing feels right.

While very different from a lot of games I play on a regular basis, I'd be more than willing to sit down with this one again if asked.

Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix is an older game that I got in a "Chosen One" contest. It looked interesting and I'm a big fan of Wolfgang Kramer, so I've been wanting to try it.

The game is played over a series of three races. For each race, you're dealt a hand of cards. Cards have movement values that are tied to particular race car colors. A card might move a single car, or all six. If there are multiple cars being moved, it might be something like Red moves 6, Blue moves 5, Green moves 4, etc. There are also some funky cards which will move any color and that will switch two colors for an entire round.

After you're dealt a hand, you have to bid on cars. The six cards will be revealed one at a time and auctioned off to the highest bidder until a) everyone has a car and b) all the cars are gone (I think, since in our six player game everyone had to get only one car). The pole position is determined by the order the cards are auctioned off.

Then you start playing cards in turn order, until the race ends. When a player plays a card, he executes the movement for all the colors on the card from top to bottom. But since he gets to move other player's cars, he can really mess them up if he wants.

The track has some bottlenecks which create interesting situations. Red, for example, might be blocked in without the ability to move and Blue might play a red 6 movement card, effectively wasting it for red. Every player has to play all their cards, even after they are out of the race. So jockeying cars around to free your car from traffic, and stick it to other players is a huge part of the game.

The race pays out huge money to the first player and it starts decreasing quickly the further back you place. At the end of the first race, you deal out a new hand, bid on new cars and run the second race. At the end of the third race the person who has the most money wins.

There's something a little wonky with the money costs/payouts in the game too. In our game, people rarely bid very high, and the prize money really rewards first place far more than later contenders. So players who finished from about third to sixth got very little money above what they spent, while first through third made a tidy profit. Ideally you'd want a player with a really awesome hand to have to pay a lot for their car to sort of balance the advantage they start with. That just doesn't happen.

I think I got the car my cards were crying out for uncontested twice. And yet even with great pole position and cards, I didn't feel like I had a good chance of creating my own destiny in this game. My fate was mostly determined by how other players inadvertently helped or hindered me.

I liked the game, but it definitely has a lot of luck going on. You might start with a really bad hand. You might have a good hand but get in a bidding war with another player for the only car that works for you. You might have great cards for a car that gets auctioned last and ends up stuck for most of the race due to the initial pole position. You might might start out great and then have the next five people conspire to mess you up and leave you in a completely horrible position. While there is some skill, I think luck plays a commanding role in the game. That being said, it's the type of game that's fun to play regardless. You do your best and luck screws you over, but at least you had fun while it was happening.

I played this game at PrezCon 05.  This is a very nice racing game, and I can see why alot of people prefer it over Formula De.  They are very different games.  Formula De is all about managing risk, and this one is by far the more strategic game.  I also played Royal Turf this weekend, and this seems to be a much more streamlined version of that.  Royal Turf moves one horse at a time, but in the course of a single round, all the horses move.  This game condenses that into a single multi-colored card, and seems like a better game to me.  I also prefer this game's auction over that game's blind bidding.

Saw this on the cheap and grabbed it.  Fun game with cards for movement, more strategy than you'd think based on playing the cards and bidding (esp. in the 3rd bidding round).  Recommended.

I am not convinced that in Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix players actually make meaningful choices that can determine his/her fate. I think that chaos reigns and who ends up in the winners circle is a function of how the chaos capriciously aligns. 

Having made this slanderous claim, I must confess there is ample evidence to the contrary... the evidence against massive chaos is that I always seem to lose! If this game were nothing more than gleeful viciousness mixed with gobs of  chaos, would it actually be possible for me to consistently, persistently, finish at the end of the pack as I do? Certainly those drivers I lag half a lap behind must be doing something clever to be so far in front. Yet, I am still not convinced. A few lucky breaks, being in the right spot at the right time (and having three or four other players put you there) seems to seal the win. 

Thus, Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix (/Daytona 500) represents a strange anomaly in my rankings. Usually I loathe chaos, I find lack of control over outcome in a game a sign of wasted time. Usually to get a 9 or 10 for me, even an 8, the game has to have a big dose of personal responsibility. Games I like often have traceable moments in them where you know how you could have played better and made a difference. 

And thus the anomaly: for a chaos hater and ratings miser like me, a game like this getting a 9 is just weird. But what can I say, DCGP oozes fun. The player interaction, the delusion of affecting your own car's finish, the burning up of another's precious fuel while they are locked in a jam, these are all just moments drenched in fun. Simply, this is the rare game that is so enjoyable to be a part of, I don't really care if I am just a monkey pulling levers not hooked up to any machine. I embrace the meaningless (or, if there is more strategy here than I can fathom, I instead embrace my cluelessness) and pine to play again and again.

Played a few times now and its an enjoyable game - even if i suck at it. Always played with 5 or 6. Modfied rules so at we play cars in the order they were bought rather than clockwise after the pole.

Another great kids game but this one has some adult appeal.  The mechanics are fairly simple but with younger kids, I suggest ignoring the bidding and just pass our the cars.  This leads to sub-optimal play but is easier for young kids to understand.  Basically this is a card game.  Cars are auctioned off after the cards have been dealt.  The cards have movement allotments for one or more cars.  Each car is moved its alotment in the order they appear on the card.  First car farthest across the finish line wins and when all cars are across or all cards are played money is paid out to the winner.  After 3 races the player with the most money wins.

Cardplay that's optimal for you and not optimal for your opponents is the key.  The screw your neighbor factor, auction, and planning make this one really fun.  Fast setup and quick playtime are other plusses.  An excellent racing game for those tired of Formula De.

1play 3 player. Racing games are fun and this is no exception. It is somewhat of a strategic game what with those single lane bottlenecks and it plays fast. It is worth a play or two for me but not much more than that. Perhaps with more than 3 players, it would be more chaotic.

RATING: 7
Good racing game. Like an advanced Ave Caesar with an added auction to buy the cars and with movement of opponents' cars as well as your own (wasting good moves for opponents as in Winner's Circle).

However, the "swap colour X and Y" cards are just annoying and grind the game to a halt as all players need to reevaluate everything for a round.

A neat system that I overlooked far too long. Daytona 500 is superior, but I like the chokepoints and the track variety. Top Race, though, is the best incarnation (haven't played the original Niki Lauda game). Great, tough choices most of the time, but the auction just doesn't work properly. There is a perfect iteration yet to be designed....

Despite what my rating might suggest, I think out of all of the racing games I've played so far, this has to be my preferred choice.  Easy to pick up rules with non-complicated cards definitely made D-C Grand Prix a much more streamlined compared to other titles with similar theme.  I'm a bit torn on the limited number of special cards available.  On the one hand, I like the minimalist and simplistic approach, because after all in a real race, it's not as if you can out right attack other players to get ahead.  On the other, there were times I wish I had ways to slow someone down.

I'm not sure how balanced the cards are in reality, because someone always manage to get a huge lead, and while one or two manage to catch up, more often than not the first place was already decided by the mid-game.  The tracks themselves are nicely conceived though, lots of frustrating bottlenecks that can change the outcome of the race.  My first impression is slightly above average, but I have to admit it isn't a theme I really look forward to playing.

After 5+ Plays: I picked this one up cheap, not knowing much about it.  It really surprised me with simple mechanics that lead to interesting decisions and lots of opportunities for clever and strategic play.  I think it hits its sweet spot with three players, which is unusual in games and guarantees it a permanent spot in my collection.

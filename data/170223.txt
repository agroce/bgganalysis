I backed this on Kickstarter based on an early review by "Radho Runs Through." It looked like a lot of fun, with a flexible, scenario-based gameplay and attractive components. Having played it solo a few times now I find the scenarios which are included to be difficult and frustrating. I'm reserving final judgement until I can get a group together and try playing with multiple players.

RATING: 5
The rulebook can kill the game for you. Combat is not well described, the difference between general event cards and scenario events is not that clear. The way raiders move (f.e. in scenario 2) is very free-form so that they group has to play it their own way (hard or easier).

THe designer is very active in the BGG forum sector but the rulebook is really bad laid out.

I really like the game though but you have to keep in mind when cheking this game out that you have to put some work into it (check out forums etc.) to learn the game.

The concept behind is pretty neat. I like the leveling up, I like the exploration aspect of it, I like the way the wider the galaxy becomes the harder the game gets but the more Astartium you get. I like the combat mechanic - even if it is simple.

The scenario 1 and 2 feel very different but my gaming group does not like the game that much - we had situation where one player really fell behind the rest (level-wise).  Maybe it is because of the design. maybe it is because of our choices.

Scenario 2 can be very frustrating if you have not that many movement points to cross asteroid belts. You are effectively out of the game then...

After more plays the big plus of the game is that it is very tactical and plays very quick.

But the rules will Stop you on every first attempt of a scenario.

Gameplaywise it is an 8.

This game is really fun and has a good coop feel.   Slowly add ships / powers to your armada which allows for card modification of dice rolls as you attempt to overcome explore events, attack raider ships and prepare for battles with the boss battles.  The initial ruleset book could have been better written but they have now released an updated rulebook which is better.  Once you get the game down it is quite enjoyable especially if you like coop games.  The biggest issue I have with it is that sometimes the cards which come out make the game unwinnable despite best play (even with the best dice rolls) which is unfortunate.

RATING: 3
First off, the rule book for this game is horrid, lots of unanswered questions, especially around combat.  Played the opening scenario and honestly I am not sure what we could have done differently to win.  It was a race to finish a task but the entire time I felt like I didn't have enough actions or movement point to be able to accomplish what needs to be done.  Plus if you don't do well, there really isn't much you can do to recover because there are only 10 turns in the game.  Hard pass for me, I am so glad I did not back this game, but I will admit the minis are impressive.

Game is pretty interesting for a solo/co-op space opera-ish game. I will say the game is very, very tough and some of the Bosses seem OP. But that's just me. :D

The various scenarios play very very differently, too.

OK, having played 9 games, I will say this: the game systems are solid. No question. All work well, and smoothly. The scenarios cry out to be re-balanced. Having slim to no margin for error is not enjoyable. You need to hit your rolls perfectly EACH TIME or you're done for. And looking at the game countdown and doing some quick calculations telling you that you have 3 rounds left with ZERO mathematical chance of accomplishing a mission is simply no fun.

Really fun 3X game (no "exploit"). Gameplay is smooth and engaging with interesting decisions to be made every turn. A two player game takes around 90 minutes with very little down time. I have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone who likes space-themed games

It's fine.  I like the feeling of being a starship captain, but the captains don't feel significantly different and the scenarios, although technically different, feel procedural and samey.

RATING: 6.5
Centauri Saga is a fun game if you play it with someone who is familiar with it.  The components are nice and the game looks good on the table.  The original rulebook is terrible and the reprinted "fixed" version wasn't much better, but there is now an upgraded 1.5 version that is much better.  

Once you get past the issues it can be a really fun co-op game.  Winning is extremely difficult at first, but gets easier with experience.  There is a PvP version to the game as well in certain missions, but I have not played that aspect to comment on it.  With a new legacy-type campaign expansion on the way later this year as well as the Special Ops add on which gives you alternative goals during the missions, there is a lot of game for a reasonable price here.

Rating down from a initially 7 after four playthroughs with Fixing the Jumpgate (2 players). 
++ Good feeling on playing, time flies
+ nice material (except the player-mats, they are horrible)
- too lucky (dice rolls)
-- very bad balanced 
-- you need luck with spawning XPM, if you are unlucky and don't get early spawns, you are unable to win (scenario Fixing the jumpgate)
--- bad balance on bosses, three times it was not possible to install just 1 XPM (you need 3 in a 2-player-game) with spawning bosses Red Barron and Black Carrier. One time we won in the last possible action with bosses Corrupted Crow and Asteroid of Death.
-- rulebook is really terrible

Never ever play "Fixing the Jumpgate" again. Maybe i will try an other scenario.

Good dice-chucking co-op space game. Once you get through the rules (which are pretty badly structured and unclear in certain areas) the game flow is pretty good. There are some interesting decisions to make regarding what to do and which upgrades to purchase. Player specialization seems to be rewarded. 
It's a difficult game (which is good) but still beatable. Unfortunately luck of the dice/draw can screw you over a bit more than I'd like in a game.

I love the idea of a cooperative space exploration and combat game, and the components are quite cool (except for the flimsy player boards). We tried playing this game twice, but the atrocious rulebook and punishing difficulty ruined it for us. I doubt I can get this to the table again, and I don't really want to either.

RATING: 6.75
So-so game overall. First edition rulebook is really bad. Game mechanics aren't too bad, but thematically the game is weird (A unit called Devastator actually has the ability to repair your armada's hull, for instance). Balance seems to lack polish. Difficulty varies a lot, and sometimes a bad combo of cards or a single bad dice roll can ruin the rest of the game. Luck seems more important than tactics, which is a huge shame.

Really hope that the 1.5 upgrade and the new legacy campaign sway me in a more positive rating. I didn't get to play this as much as i wanted because the few experiences resulted in dread/immediate demise. 

I understand a CO-OP game should be tough and require team-work, but i found no room for error which became frustrating really quick. There are few (if any) ways to bounce back from a loosing streak so you can figure how a 10 round game will go by the result of rounds 3-4. 

I really really want to give the game more love, and with the incoming improved components (the mats..) and some decent house ruling, i could see this back on my table.

Adventure game in space. Quite good, mechanics are ok, a lot of dice rolling (like in any adventure game) so the luck is a main factor here. I like it. On the bad side - there are not enough cards so it can be quite repetive even after 1 game. I see potential for some expansions.

-The game offers some really exciting edge of your seat moments that make it an exhilarating experience.  Each gameplay feels epic with a capital E, and doesn't drag.
-Great for solo play as well as multiplayer & plays the same way for both.
-The will be enjoyed most by folks who enjoy a game for the experience/story that unfolds, irrespective of whether they win or lose.  The die rolls and card draws add a lot of randomness (but also create the variety and excitement), and so some games are going to play out tougher from the get go than others.  But the players mitigate this through careful planning and tactical playing of cards to mitigate the randomness.  Working together to prioritize which threats to deal with and when to do it, (whilst ensuring objectives are reached), through careful choice of Commander abilities, upgrades & Action cards really makes this a fun game where your choices matter.
-The 1.5 rules are much clearer than previous versions - still a couple of things not clearly explained but BGG forums help fills the hole and designer is v. active  
-A co-op that does not play as a re-themed Pandemic is always appreciated.

I played this at a demo at gen con. Had a very good time playing with my fiance and two other attendees. They did a surprisingly good job at capturing the 4x feel in a co-op game (Please note this was with the Updated rule book, made a world of difference!). In order to hit objectives you'll have to expand via exploration, which in turn gives more spawning grounds for the rogue fighters that slow down movement, but grant resources on beating them. These resources can be spent upgrading one of two tracks (which furthers a third track at certain milestones) which enhance abilities relating to fighting, exploring, repairing, and others. Each person has their own ship stats and their own tech trees, as well as their own pool of one shot cards granted by destroying rogues and exploring. These cards can be used on each other with the owners discretion.

This sets up for a game that forces coordination and specialization. You have to make sure someone is bouncing around taking out rogue fighters while amassing enough power to take down bosses and complete objectives. Overall very fun co-op game The makers are a cool lot and very dedicated. 

Something I'll mention, but have left out of my rating since I haven't experienced it yet: the publisher, Vesuvius Media, has additional scenarios on their forums, allow for user submission, and are working on a crossover campaign with another one of their games ("Cosmic Pioneers"). Once I've given it a go I'll update accordingly.

Sci-fi 4x Co-op! Mission driven hex tiles space exloration. Variable player powers, spend crystals to strengthen your armada by leveling command, combat and research tech trees. Dice based combat and exploration. Use command tokens and upgrade powers to mitigate luck. Intuitive play rules. I love the mystery and excitement of the scanning report system. I also like the exploration threat level condition of the encounters. The recurring events is a fun cumulative damage system. I don't like when the missions tell you exactly when the boss encounters happen--probably a balance thing, wish it could be unknown or uncertain for more suspense. Kudos for game play that does a decent job to encourage teamwork instead of everyone running off on their own against a common goal. I wish there were more variability on the tech trees but oh well. We love tile exploring, challenging co-ops that encourage teamwork, rolling dice, and teching-up. Tempted to back this.

Lightweight tactical game of positioning. It is VERY easy to pick up and play, with great artwork, and it's very satisfying when you find combinations of units which bolster each other. This is a lot of fun in a small package. I loved it.

Juego de cartas para 2 jugadores, versus de una facción contra otra (hay 3 cajas en total, ésta y 2 más, habiendo hasta ahora 6 facciones en total).
Sencillísimo de aprender a jugar y con más miga de lo que parece, es un juego completamente táctico más que estratégico, con un azar también alto teniendo en cuenta las cartas que te van saliendo. 
Me encanta el formato mini reducido, ocupando justo el espacio necesario, junto con un tablero doblado en papel en la caja, que no es imprescindible para jugar (es más, recomiendan jugarlo también sin tablero, puesto se concibió así), pero el apoyarte en los bordes del mismo también tiene su punto táctico. 
Las diferentes unidades crean ciertas posibilidades tácticas, y le dan un buen punto al juego.
El objetivo es ser el primero en destruir 20 unidades contrarias, o 4 de sus unidades más importantes.
Expansión con factores de terreno y clima. 

En cuanto a estas dos facciones las veo más equilibradas que otras barajas.

This is essentially a trick taking disguised as a war themed card game. Imagine that you play a card saying "4" on it. Your enemy plays a "5" and wins. To beat his five you play two threes, and so the game progresses until one of you has taken enough tricks to win the game.

The meat of the game is in choosing which battles to engage because you do not have to fight for every trick. Instead, cards are played on a battlefield and you only fight the cards next to yours. In addition there are certain cards that allow for ranged combat.

But this does not save the game. Now it is just repetitive and boring. I guess Lords of War could have been better if players had some other goal than just taking tricks, or playing required e.g. more careful use of cards. Now you just play the one that beats the enemy and that is it.

Very simple rules - simpler than Summoner Wars. Plays more like an abstract game, which isn't really my cup of tea.

RATING: 7
The first set of game that I tried that was rather quick, fun and easy to learn Math game. 

Overall, the player that could control the board presence would usually win the game if the draw of cards are average. 

I can see that there are strategy to the whole game, depending on how you place your units. The game is simple and highly replayable. 

Only lacking of variants as well as more variety in cards. Good family Wargame-like system.

Great two player fantasy battle game. Well written rules, pick it up in minutes, reliably lasts 30-45 minutes. Just the right mix of luck and skill to make a win feel great, but a loss not crushing. Pick it up!

CLARIFICATION
How does the attack on ranged weapon units work? Do they choose 1 unit to attack.  Can they attack immediately when deployed?

Dwarf Spells:
Ice Shield spell boost the defence of adjacent units.  Effects can be stacked.
Frost Bolt which hits for 1 damage and stay on the target to reduce the target enemy unit strength of attack.

Orc Spells:
Fireball hits for 1 attack and also reduce the target enemy unit strength of attack.
Berserk - turn a unit into a Berserker.

FLYING TROOPS: Can only be damaged by opponent's flying troops or ranged attack unit.

This game feels abstract to me.  Something in the vein of Tash-Kalar rather than Summoner Wars.  Was initially apprehensive to buy this since I have Neuroshima Hex with the specific arrows that point towards the adjacent space in which the units can attack (and subsequently move).  One thing I need to learn to grasp in the open ended positioning in which you can put your card out.

I believe that this game requires a few plays before players can appreciate the subtlety of the tactic and strategy as they would need to know the characteristic of the attack and other special abilities that the unit may possessed for each of the faction.

I haven't deck build as I have yet to understand the distinct strengths and weaknesses of the faction in general and the power of the units (although I have a rough idea on what they do).

An hoping the game have an active forum where players can discuss strategy, tactic and deck building.

However, one good things about this game is that players does not need to worry about resources.

Certain things to remember in Lord of Wars.
(1) Hand Limit: 6 Cards (without the expansion)
(2) Card Anatomy - Attack Arrows (similar to Neuroshima Hex and most likely Immortal), Attack Value (Neuroshima Hex as number of arrows that determine the strength of its damage), and Defence Value (Neuroshima has no indictation of Defence Value other than 'Shield'; all Neuroshima Hex units only have 1 Life unless stated otherwise which I believe there is a + sign).
(3) Each cards have different rank for the deck building purpose (Recruit, Regular, Veteran, Elite, Special, Command, and General)
(4) Do not shuffle your General card.  You should set it aside during set-up.
(5) Ranged Units attack different and valid target is determined by the target grid
(6) Important Note: All Spear units and Ranged Weapon Units can be placed adjacent to friendly units; these units are consider to be 'Support' units.
(7) During Reinforcement, a player can recall a unit from the Battle Mat.

To win the game: A player need to defeat up to six units with the Command Icons, including the General or to elimate 20 of the opposition cards.

Other information:
1. You most probably want to protect the weak side of some units.
2. The Starting space has already been indicated on the playmat.
3. After playing card, refresh card back to 6.
4. If there are no enemy units on the playmat, then the active player can deploy a unit adjacent to any of his friendly unit.
5. If there are no units on the battlefield, then the active player can place his unit on any space on the playmat.
6. Ranged attacking units (in this game) does not require Line of Sight,.


6. During elimination, all units attack simultaneously.  If total combine attack value is equal or less than the defence value, then nothing will happen to the opposing unit.
7. IMPORTANT: Eliminated units are not immediately removed until all possible engagements have been checked.
8. Sometimes it is advisable to make a suicide move meaning to place a unit will also be eliminated along with the opposing unit.
9. IMPORTANT RULE TO REMEMBER: Player who eliminated a General take an extra action.
10. As much as possible, be careful when playing weaker units.

Phase 1: Deployment - Engagement Rule
Phase 2: Elimination - Determine whether any unit has been eliminated
Phase 3: Reinforcement - Refresh your hand

Engagement Rule is where player must place his or her unit cards with the attack arrow pointing towards an opposing (enemy) unit.

Lords of War was one of my impulse buys (along with the play mat). It's good, but I can see how the game might get a bit tiring after a while, mainly because there isn't a lot of variation on abilities. There is quite a few stuff going on, and I could do with a bit more deckbuilding without needing multiple sets, but I can think of quite a few variants that can scratch that itch (e.g. drafting leaders, then elites...). I'm sure Weather & Terrain, *followed* by deckbuilding (as left/right units are actually asymmetric now) make selection of units more strategic).

Personally, I feel it's an OK game (was happy enough to take it for free) but it's not to my tastes.

I played one game where we had an interesting board setup. However, the health of units seems to be low enough that this is an anomaly. Generally, there's one or two units on the board as they can be quickly eliminated (and why wouldn't you?) and so the decisions to be made remain a bit too simple for my tastes.

I liked the idea of mixing decks, but I really dislike the over-complicated customisation rules.

I'll probably review it, then get rid of it.

On the positive side, it's simple enough and has enough randomness that a newbie has a chance of winning against an experienced player.

B/f was sent a demo copy of this.

Some interesting ideas here and initially I thought it would play similarily to Battle for hill218 however your card placement on your turn is very very limited.

It is very quick and combat is a very simple affair. 

If your opponent manages to get a few units in the corner you will not be able to get them back out of it.

More indepth rules are needed as both of us had a lot of questions during and then after the game, and we both came to the conclusion that the placement rule when you have no units on the board needs improving as we may or maynot have played it very wrong.

Seems to be a huge advantage for player one.

Rules are easy to learn, but to really get it how to play you need 3-4 plays. First thought was "what's the point, it's just killing units by luck of cards" - but once you get how to play it tactically it becomes an exciting addictive game.

Lords of War is a very fun 2 player tactical card game with an interesting spatial element to it. By adding movement the expansion makes the boardstate much more dynamic which makes the game even better. But even without it it's a cool game.

RATING: 3
2p card game where placing really matters. Everyone can attack in only a couple regions, meaning you want to build a strong lineup that won't crumble under an attack. But every factions has certain "kill" cards: they are strong enough to eliminate one opponent's card and then... are usually fodder, taking up space and just waiting to be eliminated again or whatever.

Yeah dunno. Perhaps if I play it again with someone experienced, someone who can guide me through a bit? I just wanted to like ths game a lot more than I did.

only did the play test at Birmingham game expo so far but its was so easy to pick up and quick, so bought,  i've not played similar games it will probably be compared to e.g summoner wars.. but it kinda reminded me of hive in the placements, personally i think they should do a futuristic version to set it aside form summoner and such..(*but i'm too into my netrunner for that at the momment so i might be biased)
1st thoughts  its a nice quick portable holiday travel type game, they mention 3-4 players on the website need to check that out.. i wonder how different the other armies will be,  elf art looked good,  
if i can get more plays i could see it going up might be a lunch brake game, 
Conclusion, fantasy themed Hive.. kinda a tad basic .. hidden depthnot sure.. still fun pass time

This seems to fit into the category of quick battle games with numerous asymmetrical armies such as Neuroshima Hes and Summoner Wars. There are some clever ideas here, and I admit that I may not have played enough to discover whatever hidden depths it may have. However, I felt it compared poorly to either of those two games. The game dragged on to long, and I was left unconvinced that the two sides varied enough to require different playing styles. I would play it again, but as there's a classic that already fills this niche (Neuroshima Hex), it wouldn't be my first choice.

An interesting one-on-one battle game. I like the mechanics that force each play to initiate combat, which keeps the pace brisk. In the end, though, I think this lacks some of the depth that Summoner Wars has and is too similar to that title for me to add to the collection.

Played one game with Nick (one of the designers) at Essen 2014 and had a really good time learning the game. I got soundly trashed, but I suppose that can be expected playing against such a veteran player. Other than the order in which cards come out, there is hardly any luck involved in the game (which I like). Artwork is very invocative and clear. Also bought the playmat and events expansion - cannot wait to play this with my son!
UPDATE: This game gets better and better the more I play it (and the more I get a feeling for the different decks)! AND it gets better with the intermediate rules. Looking forward to try the advanced rules with flying and magic wielding units. Great tactical game.

Only got this game recently - was bought it by a friend who went to the UK Games Expo, where it won Best Strategic Card Game. It's fantastic! The artwork is amazing and it's very simple to learn but each games has so much variety and strategy to it. It took me a couple of games before I realised, but now I see that the Orcs really feel like an aggressive army while the Dwarves feel more defensive and strategic. Can't wait for Elves vs Lizardmen, which is going to be the next pack. I highly recommend for people who like strategy/tactical games.

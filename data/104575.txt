Interesting game - two-player perfect-information mind-cruncher. As such, not terribly interesting, as there aren't any real surprises - here, surprises are just things you overlooked, so, more your mistakes than strokes of genius by the other player.

There is only enough tiles for one balanced setup. The rule book fell short in helping ease play. Interesting mechanics and fun enough to play but ultimately just too fiddly for the payoff. I didn't like the opponent being able to move my sub. Gifted it to someone who really enjoyed it. :)

This is the game that Seas of Iron wanted to be.  Tight dueling with worker placement, reasonable abstraction of naval maneuvering, and damage management.  Good integration of mechanics with dieselpunk theme.  Random tile setup adds greatly to replayability.

I like the idea behind the game, but the execution was obtuse. Moving either sub on your turn was odd. Having to move your sailors back to "start" after using them also felt odd. Just reminded me of some kids toy selling pretty instead of substance.

Again, bought this on advice. Again not good advice. Lots of little parts and the rule about moving towards the center of the sub after an action makes no sense (so many people forget to do it. Game goes like this: "wake up, move, deactivate player but not there, unless its there then it moves again..." too many little bits for what it is. I know of no better submarine game. Good effort.

I found the rules hard to understand; I think the theme is neat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Neat concept, but game felt incomplete and a little lacking. I really like what it delivers in an abstract sense - attacking sections of the ship, each ship compartment has its own power, oxygen, HPs, the relationship of the subs to each other, etc.

The artwork is really nice with creative concepts for the sub compartments.

It mentioned at least one mechanic (oxygen deprivation) that was a viable strategy but I think wasn't available until the expansion (could be wrong). And I think only one player can board the other person's ship. Which was made more odd by the fact that the character is over on the ship causing problems but the other player can't get rid of that character (I guess the crew have no hand guns). The only way to get rid of that character is to take a hit from the other player in that section of the sub, I guess. Also, thematically, the point is to destroy the other sub, or wait for them to run out of oxygen, so the guy you send over there is probably on a suicide run.

There were some rules ambiguities (ie. who allocates damage?) but overall it didn't grab me. The small expansions are pricey and I don't feel that they will improve my feeling for the game so I will not be laying out the cash for those.

1st game: Judging the situation correctly was not easy, which makes the first few game interestingly challenging. I did not feel the immediate tension of a game like Hive, though, were you're always on your toes and feel pressure from the beginning on (in Hive, the goal of encircling and not being encircled is very simple, and starting to encircle can be done early in the game, so the pressure builds up quickly). Enjoyed it, though.

I can see the potential in this game, in the category of brain-burners with a relatively steep appreciation curve.  This category reminds me of Dungeon Twister.

Steam Torpedo does not have the most streamlined rules and the easiest iconology, so it is not a game that I am inclined to play as often as Innovation or Race, or even Earth Reborn, which have more streamlined rules, despite being more complex.

A highly tactical 2 player skirmish game with no luck and perfect information at all times. A very tight rules-set lets you really focus on optimizing each action you get every turn in what generally boils down to a tense head-to-head struggle to see who will blow up the other person's submarine before they run out of air!

Innovative submarine duel game. you draft tiles to build your custom submarine and then man different compartments to move and attack the other player's sub. there is no dice rolling and defeat is possible in two ways, destruction of your sub or running out of oxygen. Nothing else like this game out there.

I am hooked on the world and the visual of the game, Steam Torpedo is terribly tactics and have à good life due to random placement of tiles. Just an inversion of compartments can change all. Once the rules well understood, it is a treat to chain matches that can sometimes last only 15 minutes.
With experience, one look is enough to see the strengths and weaknesses of the submarine that has just been generated, it's to the player to use them well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
 I like some of the thoughts of this game. I felt like the maneuvering system worked well. A tactical submarine battle is a bit hard to pull off, so I felt like the way they did it was not bad. I like the customization element, and I felt that the game offered plenty of interesting choices. However, I felt it had some rough spots as well. I am really not a fan of the deterministic combat. I felt that it really made the game kind of boring and procedural. The game tries to be very minimalist on components to keep cost and footprint down, but this was to its detriment. A board that clearly defines the five sea zones, as well as a board that clearly illustrates what is the front and the back of each submarine would have made this game feel less abstract and cleared up some confusion. This is a game where I appreciate the effort, but in the end it is not for me.

1 play, Origins 2015

It's a 2-player game of one-on-one submarine combat. Subs are represented by 10 tiles, arranged randomly in front of each player (except control room is always in center). The sub standups go between the players' tiles and show their relative positions (front/back/port/starboard of each other), and either at close range or far if not side-by-side. The tiles for each sub are different, with specific functions per tile (attack in certain direction and distance, move extra, repair damage, etc). The tiles also have variable starting oxygen tokens. Players start with tokens for a captain and 4 crew, all in the command center.

On your turn, first spend one O2 token -- if you're out, you lose. Then you get one sub move, plus one action per crew. The sub can move one space per occupies engine room. Each crew can either move one space or activate the room, in which case they must also move one step towards Command. The Captain may move AND activate (in either order). If you attack, you target a specific zone (front, back, port, or starboard) depending on your relative positions. Defender allocates damage dealt (modified by any manned defensive tiles you have). If a tile takes max damage, it's flipped (any occupying crew die). If all in a section are destroyed, damage goes to Command. Command can also voluntarily divert up to 3 hits to a section to itself (as ONE hit). If Command is destroyed, you lose.

It's an interesting game of maneuver (position your sub with best defense and attack side facing other sub) and attack. The tiles are always the same, but their relative positions are different. So you also have to manage your crew movement to be able to efficiently operate your sub. I'm not sure if this is my kind of thing -- seems awfully thinky and abstract-y -- but I wouldn't mind trying it again.

Great player-driven combat game that can be very chaotic, but from human choices, not random events or die rolls. Lots of ways to create your sub and experiment with tactical combinations. Activation mechanic is fresh and interesting. Not sold on the "collectible" mentality, but something a little different worth checking out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Perfect information game about duelling submarines. Each submarine is composed of 10 tiles in two rows of five, with the rows representing port and starboard. The four tiles to the left are the rear of the submarine and the four to the right are the front. Additionally, each player has a small submarine token; these are used to show where the subs are in relation to one another -- i.e., to show whether the enemy is in long or short range, whether it will be hit from front-facing torpedoes or rear-facing mines, or which side a broadside will do damage to. 

The tiles themselves are cleverly multi-use and must be manipulated by moving (painfully slowly!) five crew tokens. Each crewman in a green compartment adds one armour to that section (port/starboard/front/back); each crewman in an engine compartment adds one movement. Other compartments can be triggered to fire weapons, remove damage or other effects.

The game also has a clock in the form of oxygen tokens. If a sub runs out, it's game over, but compartments may also lose oxygen when damaged.

It's a very clever system that I wish I liked more than I do. In addition to the usual problem of special-power card games -- i.e., that there is a lot of reading involved due to the variety of powers -- it's a game of attrition. The way that rooms work mean that you have to give up defensive capability either before or after an attack, so to some extent the game is about balancing the damage you have to take in order to deal more.

Still, it's very well done, and the prospect of expansion packs, drafting variants etc. allows for huge strategy in submarine construction as well as action. It doesn't work for me but it's worth a look.

Played at a friends game night. The game's rules are broken, the ships are broken, the gameplay (after you figure out the gaps in the rules) is boring and easily messed up. The iconography needs help.

There is fun to be had, but serious house rules have to be made. If you're not willing to put the time into making your own set of rules, skip this game.

This is a luckless, perfect information game. So how far ahead are you willing to plan you moves and anticipate those of your opponent? 
Whereas abstract strategy games allow you to recognize a pattern (and possible courses of action just by looking at the board, here you need to read text on 20 large tiles. I guess it might become intuitive with repeated plays, but expect some solid AP in your first few games if both players are serious about winning.

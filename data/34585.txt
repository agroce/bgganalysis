RATING: 4
I did not really like this one too much...

Every player moves his stones strategicly on different tracks as far as possible to get points. If a certain number of stones pass a border on the track the game ends.

On your way everybody tries to collect some extra points or extra moves.

I can see why this won the SdJ. It's a great game that plays quickly and offers fun decisions. An excellent filler or game to end the evening. If you enjoy Lost Cities, I think you'll have a lot of fun with this one.

In Short Keltis is Lost Cities for up to 4 players. The game is easy to learn, plays quick and offers meaningful decisions to make. Compared to Lost Cities there are more degrees of freedom since you can play cards in both ascending and descending order. Moreover, pushing your luck elements are less prominent since in Keltis you cannot play investment cards, to multiply your wins or losses, or small value cards to start an expedition in hopes of getting at least 8 cards on the table. Instead the only thing that matters in Keltis is the number of cards you play, not their value. This also affecst the scoring which is more straightforward in Keltis.

In the long run Keltis can become a bit repetitive since the most of the excitement is in the luck of draw. Personally I am inclined to regard Lost Cities as slightly better of the two since it is a bit tighter. However, the difference is not significant, especially for occasional play.

2013/01
Not enough to keep you playing on a weekly basis. Still good for occasional fun.

Fun game, with push-your-luck elements. Keltis is not a game you'd spent days on analyzing. It's just a simple pure fun.

The board game version of Lost Cities?  Yes, in as much as Zooloretto was Coloretto: the Board Game.

The 4-player game loses much of the confrontation of playing Lost Cities (with 2 players).  Bluffing and fighting over the discards in LC was half the game.  This is friendlier and more solitaire-y.  The end game was surprising, but still entertaining.  Having played this now, I'm drawing more and more parallels between this and...Coloretto.  Hmm...

After 2 plays:
This card-driven abstract game is easy to learn and plays fast, as usually with Knizia's abstracts. The strategy level is low, but is a fun game. Because it is based on card play, luck has a pretty big share in it.

Fun version that I believe to be better than the 2-player card game.  With two of every card in the deck, there is more uncertainty in the draw. The larger figure (forgot the name) is a better way to represent the handshake cards in the 2-player card game.  :thumbsup:

Lost Cities with a board and the Irish Green paint pot emptied all over it by Kosmos.  Three plays, all four-player.  VP, stone, and extra move tiles accentuate Lost Cities' push your luck element.  With four players the luck of the draw is w-a-y too significant.  

Not quite up to the expected Kosmos production standards; the cards are a bit flimsy, the artwork cliched and uninteresting, and there is a colour mismatch between a player tile and pieces.

There just isn't much to this game (I've got the Keltis version): play the cards you can and hope you get other useful cards down the road. It's as light as a piece of lint. 

In the 3-player game I just played, two players started all five paths and one player started four; it seemed to make no sense to do otherwise. Toward the end, two of us had nothing but worthless cards in hand. All we could do was discard and hope.

Knizia is just going through the motions these days. Making this the Game of the Year is insane. 

Update: 4-player is better than 3-player, but not by much. You still need a good starting hand to win. Rating changed from 2 to 3.

I like Keltis mostly for how swift it plays (a 2-player game can be played in 10 minutes once you've learned to swiftly evaluate your cards, with only a minute or two of setup). A good numbers game with some agonizing decisions; some minor but interesting tactics present in when to steal away a stone from your opponent at the cost of a large gap in your own stacks of cards.

I'm rather amazed at just how often we end up grabbing this one for a quick play. Bumping up its rating because of that; it hasn't yet grown stale.

Not as good as a 4-player game, due to a less developed endgame; it's mostly just a rush.

It's quite ironic that Knizia won his SdJ for a game that is not so new and original, and lacks an interesting scoring system à la Knizia... Anyway, it's a light game with an appeal to non-gamers, so I had to buy it when I saw it with a very low price tag while on vacation in Vipiteno...

For the first time, I totally disagree with the title of "Spiel des Jahres". And that's a pity because Reiner Knizia made fantastic stategy games like Amon-Re and Durch die Wüste, lovely fun games like Formula Motor Racing and Royal Turf ,exciting cardgames like Ivanhoe and my favourite short one Medici. There were multiple changes for Knizia to win this monumental price in gaming, unfortunately he got it with a very common game. It isn't really original, you don't have the feeling you controll the game, it's even a bit boring. The last years the "Spiel des Jahres"- trophy went to somewhat lighter game in comparisation with Torres or Tikal, but Zooloretto and certainly Thurn und Taxis were enough strategic for a so called familygame. Everybody could love it. Keltis is no game for strategic game lovers, even on a family journey.

Yuk. Decisions pretty much make themselves and the card draw is huge factor in who wins. Good luck if you draw a hand of high cards at the start, there's absolutely nothing you can do to mitigate this under the basic rules.

The variant might improve this a little but I'm not in a hurry to try it.

[i]Posted: 1/5/09, Rated: 7[/i]
{2P: ???, 3P: ???, 4P: 7}

What's more elusive than a leprechaun's pot o' gold?  How about deciding which name to call a game?  [i]Keltis[/i] won the [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/geekurl][/i], but the game's true lineage descends from [i][thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing][/i].  I collect the games which won the award, and thanks to a very generous [geekurl=/user/SteveK2]Secret Santa[/geekurl], I now own a copy of [i]Keltis[/i].  What does playing it feel like?  [i][thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing][/i].

There are some differences, to be sure.  First of all, the board has a variable set-up aspect to it: tiles are randomly placed on certain stepping stones along the five paths at the beginning of the game.  This simple solution prevents the game from having a scripted feel.  Second, and perhaps the hardest change for a veteran of [i][thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing][/i] to adopt is the playing of cards.  In [i][thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing][/i], the numbers on your cards represent your score.  In [i]Keltis[/i], playing a card allows you to move one stone forward along a given path; the value of the card means nothing other than establishing an ascending or descending sequence.

That leads us to our third difference: the cards in [i]Keltis[/i] can be played in either direction (ascending or descending).  This ability removes much of the "starting angst" which is present in [i][thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing][/i].  If you have a "10" and a "9" in red, you don't have to hold on to them and hope for some lower support numbers before embarking in that color.  This loss of tension removes some of the enjoyment from the game.  It also makes discarding less prevalent.  A cascading effect from having fewer discards is a reduced capacity to control the timing of the end of the game.

These changes result in a game that isn't as compelling as its progenitor.  On the plus side, it looks great.  It's pretty much guaranteed to be played at least once every year, on March 17th.  I might just find that little rascal's gold, yet.

Presented as Lost Cities for four players I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately a lot of rules were changed from the two player version. Not sure why as it seems to me like it would be perfectly playable just using two Lost Cities decks. Furthermore I feel like all the changes make the game far more luck dependent, changing it from a strategic joust between two players to a luckfest. I esspecially dislike the bonus tiles as their random distribution can destroy game balance. It still is an ok game and a good way to pas the time. But it's not even a shadow of the game it could have been.

As the mediocre game it is, Keltis succeeds in one thing only: growing boring soon and annoying the players quickly, all of which made it the perfect candidate for the Spiel des Jahres award (that it did win indeed).

Anyhow, the card and dice variants are way better than the original game, the dice filler still being the best of them all thanks to its simplicity and quick gameplay. (September 2011)

Lost Cities: The Board Game is a more tense and fun game than Keltis.  Keltis by comparison feels "overdeveloped"; that is to say, the game was made shorter and easier (less tense) to better fit the criteria the typical German family is looking for.

If you've tried Keltis and thought it was just OK, try it again with the Lost Cities rules.  You may be pleasantly surprised.

Not as good as the original 2p Lost Cities.  Luck predominates (card draws) and the bulk of the game is a visceral reaction over deciding which set to "destroy" next because you haven't been finding useful cards in the single card draws between turns.  I prefer more control and strategy in games.  I guess the bonus tiles and the ability to build up or down (high or low) are a step in the right direction (strategy).  There were very few discards (compared to what I expected from 2p Lost Cities)... perhaps my group was too unwilling to give up anything that had even marginal value for opponents.

RATING: N/A
6/8/08 - games order from Germany - gotta have "the greatest game ever made" - heh. This is simply not Lost Cities for 4ers - there is a little bit more to it than that - Knizia has added bonus movement tiles, extra point tiles, the ability to play cards in an ascending or descending order (I like this new twist) and gemstone tiles which, if gathered enough of, give you bonus points as well. I can understand the SdJ award because it plays quickly, ruleset is simple and it is enjoyable to play in a family setting. There are some choices to be made but they do not present the type of angst found in other games in this bloated collection. If you are looking for theme - move on 'cuz there's nothing to see here.

UPDATE: Keltis may be slightly tighter with 3 than with 4. Not quite sure yet, but my 3-player game felt a little more competitive and interesting than the 4-player version.
---
That clever Reiner. Where would we be without him? We'd have a lot fewer great games, anyway. I might not even play euros if not for him.

Keltis is basically 4-player Lost Cites, and it preserves the feel of that classic excellently. It's even added some very interesting player interactions by making the "expeditions" races to get to various checkpoints in addition to straight point-scoring, which is a great addition to the game and gives it just a touch of added depth. By allowing players to choose to play in ascending or descending order the discard angst or the original is nicely retained as well.

The only reasons I give Keltis a 9 instead of the 10 I give Lost Cities are: a) I'm reluctant to give anything a 10 until I've played it a few more times; and b) I think that Lost Cities actually has a very nicely-executed theme, once you know what to look for. Keltis doesn't have the same thematic traction, it seems. Funny, I got Keltis instead of waiting for the US Lost Cities-branded version because of my Irish family background and affection for the culture. We got a nice Celtic look on the new game, but I'm not sure it was worth it.

RATING: 9
I think Lost Cities: The Boardgame is actually a significant improvement over Keltis in a number of ways (although optional rules in LC:TBG allow you to play the original). Keltis was always a game with a fair amount of luck, so playing three hands and scoring the relics at the end evens things out and makes a more skillful game. Also, playing in only one direction restores some tension that Keltis had lost. It's also graphically much more attractive and more thematically cohesive. All in all, Lost Cities The Boardgame is a much superior package in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
As everyone knows, this is Lost Cities: The Board Game, but it might as well be Lost Cities: The Bored Game.  It's multi-player Lost Cities with all the sweet sweet tension taken out.  Keltis is all about luck of the draw, whereas Lost Cities is more hand management.  Yuck.  I'll just stick to playing the excellent Lost Cities for when I have two players, and play something other than this when I have more.

Not fun.  Lost Cities is fun and quick but doesn't translate well to 4 players.  Definitely not deserving of a Spiel des Jahres.  If they felt the need to reward Knizia for his many great games they should have given it for one of his great games - or give him some sort of lifetime achievement award.  This one is a dud.

A good multiplayer version of lost cities. Using the same mechanic every card you play move your tokens up one of the expedition paths gaining bonus points moves and gems. 2 Plays.

RATING: 7
The Lost Cities mechanic is alive and well here but, the multi-player design, the special powers of the random board setup and the differences in scoring give this a feel unique from Lost Cities.  You should get this if you like simple, accessible family games.

I found myself thinking that this was a fun, simple, yet interesting game that I already knew how to play.

This game is well deserved of its Spiele des Jahres award and admirably fills its niche as a light, family game that can be enjoyed with non-gamers and young children.  Don't worry though, a non-gamer will not easily be able to beat an experienced gamer but, they will both enjoy the experience.

One of our first boardgames. Really nice game which can be played in 30-45 minutes. The only bad thing about this game (considering that the game is a filler with light to medium level of strategy) is the very high luck factor. 

If you get a nice starting hand the victor has already been decided (at least in our 2 player games, this happened quite a few times). It is very hard to overcome bad luck of the draw (to virtually impossible), which can make you lump through 30 - 45 minutes watching the other player(s) climbing the points ladder.

Note: We played this game at least 30 times before we started logging plays!

Pretty good version of Lost Cities. Simple, easy to learn and play family game, and a game my spouse will (sopmetimes) play which scores it extra points. Having 2 of every card reduces the tension compared to the card game but there's more variety in this version while retaining some scope for 'take that' moments. You tend to have to play your expeditions much quicker and not worry about getting the right cards. As a gamers game I would rate it lower as its more for family play.

Another unbelievably great bargain I discovered while digging through Dragonmeet. I say this because this game is priced at 30 euros in good old Greece, and I managed to get it for just 5 pounds.

I enjoyed Lost Cities, but something tells me that I'm going to enjoy this even more.

Update: I didn't enjoy it more, but I didn't really enjoy it less, either. It was shorter than Lost Cities, and I think that this was for the best.

Updare part two: Rating goes up by one due to a 3-player game with my parents. That was much better than with 2 players.

Very deserving SdJ winner.  I'm not sure the comments about Keltis being easier because cards can be played low to high or high to low are accurate.  Seems to me that there is actually more tension in the decision making hand management a bit trickier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
2 plays, 3P (2 of which very experienced with the card game). Obviously there's money to be made from 'reworking' games to card- or boardgame form. Keltis is the boardgame version of the successful Lost Cities, and as such allows for more players to attempt a fiendish push-your-luck, but no push-another's-luck.

The basic premise of the game has remained the same. Players get a number of cards in their hand, and on their turn either play or discard one before drawing a new card from the closed deck. What has changed is the way the cards are played: the common discard piles are still there, but when playing you can now also create a high-low stack rather than a low-high one. To accomodate for the higher number of players, two cards of each number/colour combination are present in the draw deck, and this means you can add an equal card to one of your stacks too. Gone is the large bonus multiplier which put the pressure on both players; now we have a 'path' along which we can pick up bonus chits which yield points or allow you to move a token for free, without a card to 'back it up'.

As such, Keltis is a faithful rendition of Lost Cities, but just like the pair Coloretto / Zooloretto, the boardgame feels too simple, too loose. The main problem is, I suspect, the fact that stacks can be built both upwards and downwards, meaning that there is no longer any turnangst in discarding a card. Chances are nearly 100% that [i]any[/i] card you put in the common discard area can be used by another player, so it all boils down to being the luckiest with drawing the things from the closed deck. This is admittedly true with the original too, but at least there this action comes with a subtle and unsettling bite. Keltis is therefore ideal SdJ material: simple and completely bereft of any meaningful interaction between players which might result in sour faces or heated emotions. It is therefore also ideal material to avoid if you are somewhat more than an occasional games player. I'll play it when asked with some grumbling, if only to encourage people in getting games by themselves, but I'll never buy it.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Partidas marcadas en el Lost Cities: The Board Game.

Para 3 y 4 jugadores es una muy buena recomendación del tipo medio.

Parecida opinión que Lost Cities. Exploradores para 2 jugadores, Keltis para 3 o 4. Tras varias partidas me ha convencido de que es un gran acierto darle el SdJ 2008 aunque recomendaría la temática Lost Cities the BoardGame, la versión verde no se ve del todo bien. Pienso esperarme indefinidamente hasta que saquen la versión Lost Cities que tarde o temprano la harán.

Muy bueno para jugones y no jugones... uno por arriba, otro por abajo ¿y tú? Posiblemente merece un 10.

Le subo la nota a 10 por que me parece el perfecto Push Your Luck con cartas, ya que no requiere memoria ya que son vistas todas las cartas, antes tenia predilección por Cheeky Monkey pero he cambiado de opinión.

He aprendido a valorar este juego gracias a la versión de ordenador que incluye poder jugarlo en solitario aunque falta la versión para dos jugadores; es una pena que no pusieran las reglas del modo solitario en la caja del juego.

Mejor jugado con el ordenador ya que te va diciendo la puntuación que tiene.



Reglas de Keltis en solitario:
Estas reglas están sacadas del juego de Keltis para PC http://www.amazon.de/s/ref=nb_sb_noss/278-0520113-3744547?__mk_de_DE=%C5M%C5Z%D5%D1&url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=keltis+pc

Solo hay un único jugador. Consiste en hacer los máximos puntos posibles. Tomas de uno en uno los turnos jugando una carta y robando otra, también te puedes descartar en tu turno de una carta en vez de jugarla, luego como siempre robas otra (lo descartado no puede ser robado nuevamente). Las puntuaciones son las mismas excepto para las piedras que es así

Piedras/puntos
0	-4
1-2	-3
3-4	2
5-6	3
7-8	6
9	10

Si subes arriba (casilla de los 10 puntos) los 5 peones y te quedan cartas jugables, cada carta te da dos puntos.  Las cartas jugables son las que puedes añadir a las cartas de la mesa en forma de escalera.
La partida se acaba cuando se roben todas las cartas del mazo, luego hay que jugar todas las cartas de la mano (si es que puedes).

Al principio de la partida debes elegir la dificultad: 1(normal), 2 (difícil), 3 (muy difícil) y el nivel (normal, difícil y muy difícil). Dependiendo del grado de dificultad elegido, el número de cartas que recibe el jugador y el número de cartas que forman el mazo varía conforme a la siguiente tabla. Además, al final de la partida obtienes puntos adicionales según la dificultad elegida conforme a la siguiente tabla.

Al principio barajas todas las cartas y te das la CARTAS EN MANO INICIALES, y luego apartas al azar la cantidad de  CARTAS EN EL MAZO INICIALES, el resto de cartas no intervienen en el juego.

DIFICULTAD/NIVEL-	NIVEL 1		NIVEL 2		NIVEL 3
NORMAL		47/8		42/8		37/8
DIFÍCIL			48/7	43/7		38/7
MUY DIFÍCIL		49/6		44/6		39/6
			CARTAS EN EL MAZO INICIALES/ CARTAS EN MANO INICIALES

EN EL NIVEL 2 TE DAN 10 PUNTOS ADICIONES POR EMPEZAR EN ESE NIVEL.
EN EL NIVEL 3 TE DAN 20 PUNTOS ADICIONES POR EMPEZAR EN ESE NIVEL.
EN EL NIVEL 4 TE DAN 30 PUNTOS ADICIONES POR EMPEZAR EN ESE NIVEL.

Yo por ejemplo los puntos que tengo en el nivel 1 que es en el que he jugado son:

Nivel 1 normal 90 puntos 
Nivel 1 dificil 96 puntos 
Nivel 1 muy dificil 80 puntos

Lost Cities has always been dull and lacking in significant opportunities for strategy.  This board game fixes that in a few ways - by adding more players, including a second copy of every card, and sprinkling various power tokens along the scoring paths.  It's also much easier to track your score.  Lastly, the ability to start low OR high means that not all the players are working on identical goals the whole time.

This is a big improvement, and the artwork is spectacular, to the point that I knew I needed this and not the Lost Cities board game.  A winner.

Components: Nice artwork that is obscured on the board by square tiles and clover-shaped pieces. A bit too busy looking. No obvious place to stack my own cards, or the discard.

Experience: All the tension of Lost Cities, wanting to stall on a particular column of cards, but having to play something. I enjoy how the random tiles give unique texture to each column, and differentiate them in interesting ways. I like being able to increase or decrease my card column. Feels a bit fiddly; moving my piece on the board, which should be the main thing, is tough to remember to do.

A good game of balancing racing and point gathering. You have to draw cards to make runs, either ascending or descending in value and place or advance a token. This game is very playable with from 2 to 4 players. I find this game better than Lost Cities owing to the more elegant design and less relaince on luck of the draw. This game is hard to get in the US, but is worth it.

Players play collect and meld cards to advance along five paths of stepping stones.  On a turn each player must play or discard a card, then draw a replacement.  If a card is played, an advance can be made on the relevant track, possibly triggering a special space action.  Points are won or lost when five pawns are in the "end game zone".  Solid, fun game from Knizia - feels like a hybrid of Members Only and Lost Cities.  Lovely emerald green presentation, and solid game play.  One of the better games I've tried from 2008.

Egy könnyen érthető, egyszerű szabályokkal rendelkező, könnyű családi játék. Családi játékhoz mérten a kártyák miatt nagy a szerencse szerepe, de a játékélményt nem befolyásolja. A lapkák elhelyezése játékonként változik, ami kellő taktikai lehetőséget visz be a játékba, ami megnöveli az újrajátszhatóság mértékét. Családi játéknak tökéletes. (2013.12.26.) Több egyszerre lejátszott menet után kissé unalmassá válik. A család többi tagja még mindig ugyanúgy élvezi :). (2013.12.27.)
3 fővel ugyanolyan jól működik, mint kettő fővel. Gyakorlatilag az jár jól, aki végig tud kártyalapot lerakni és nem szorul cserére. A lapkák kellő izgalmat és újrajátszhatóságot visznek a játékba. Egy-egy parti nagyon gyors lefolyású. Nem mértem, de szerintem 20 percnél nem volt több. Tipikusan az a játék, amit kezdő játékosokkal lehet játszani. Kevés, könnyen megjegyezhető szabály, viszonylag egyszerű előkészíteni és gyorsan lehet elpakolni.(2013.12.29.)

Played Keltis twice on easter weekend 2009.

I find it much like Lost Cities the card game. The fustrating part of the game is the luck of the draw.

There is no strategy at all in this game. Either you got the cards or you don't. Not a lot of control. I like the ascending or descending variant compared to Lost Cities. It adds to the game in my opinion. Able to play up to 4 players is also good.

I am not going to buy this game.

UPDATE: This is a game that has really grown on us. Everyone that I show it to seems to like it. Probably one of the most requested games in our game group.

UPDATE: I've been playing the iOS version a lot lately and I've been enjoying it. I think it's one of those games that is fun if played close to it's thirty minute playing time rather than with analysis freaks.

Gave it a shot, and it was...okay. It reminded me that the luck-based aspect really bugs me with Lost Cities, and with multiple players you have to really avoid playing the same colors as the person that goes before you, and I always hate games that rely on seating like that.

Keltis is obviously very similar to Lost Cities as it's based on that game, however you have a board and chits this time around.  The game has five suits and you do the same actions as in Lost Cities.  This time for each of the five suits you have numbers ranging from 0 - 10 and 2 copies of each.  This is to take into account that you can now play up to four players.  There are no multiplier cards but one of your 5 pieces doubles scores based on it's location on the board.  There are some other differences but overall it felt kind of lacking compared to the card game for me personally.  I will say that it would work well as a gateway game.  While the game is quite abstract, I do love the Celtic visual design of the game much more than the Lost Cities Board Game.  Though I wasn't overly impressed with Keltis, it was worth owning to get a chance to play the Neue Wege, Neue Ziele expansion.

I like this better than Lost Cities: The Board Game, as it's shorter -- LCTBG tends to overstay it's welcome a bit, with it's three round structure.  When this gets too simple, we break out the expansion.  It's also "prettier".

Very abstract and almost theme-less game that I found very easy to learn, and not so complex as it seemed at first glance. Although it involves some luck you also need some good forward planning or otherwise you won't stand a chance. The games are often pretty tense because you have to choose between a lot of options on every turn.

Keltis is still good, still has that strong element of seeking to maximise opportunities in an uncertain environment, which is what I like. But Keltis is more sensitive to luck than other Knizia strategy card games especially compared to its close cousin Lost Cities: Boardgame. And the theme is decidedly less gripping than archaeologists exploring lost cities.

The first time I played this, with three players, was a frustrating experience - many rounds in which I could not play any card.  Perhaps this was due to inexperience, and I'd like to try again with 3 or 4, but I found playing with 2 people more fun, with less downtime and more cards available.

The 'theme' is irrelevant to the gameplay - it's pretty, but don't bother if you're looking for a game that is Celtic-themed beyond abstract artwork.

Possibly the least exciting SdJ I've played. While Lost Cities is a good 2-players game, this multiplayer version doesn't stand up to his ancestor. Too much luck, especially in the "chains" of tiles you place during the setup. It's fast, so we played two games in a row, but I'd live happily without playing it again, which is bad for a SdJ. I feel like the SdJ jury assigned the award to good old Reiner career, not to the game on its own merits.

Yow! Is that it? Is that all there is? This won the SdJ? really? Yes, it's a nice variant on Lost Cities, but really, this won the SdJ?? It's OK, it has one small change in that the cards might ascend or descend, but after that... really? SdJ??

Very very light family game that will tire quickly. More of a filler than a board game. The SdJ? It won the SdJ? Are you sure?

*** Played it again after 4 years. Nope, really didn't like it at all. That's for the bin.

A thoroughly enjoyable rewrite of [gameid=50] for four; not having played the original I didn't have that as a basis for comparison.  Having seen the updated English version of this, which has taken on the original theme and introduced rules changes to this version, I am happy to stick with Keltis.

RATING: 3.5
Shares a lineage with Lost Cities. I enjoy the simple elegance of Lost Cities, and I also enjoy the convoluted yet strategic madness of Keltis: das Orakel. Keltis, however, sits in an awkward middle ground and is not as tense as Lost Cities or das Orakel. The tiles have relatively little impact on the game compared to das Orakel, leaving a game that is basically a clunky, non-portable version of Lost Cities with inferior scoring.

I like what it brings to lost cities and could be fun, but lacks the risk/reward of the card game.
Edit -2011 -
Didn't previously quite get the race element and how much it's about the board rather than the cards - I believe the lost cities board design actually obfuscates this, whereas the keltis board makes it obvious. Fast and fun game.

A very interesting retooling of the lost cities engine, adding more players to the mix and shuffling in some new twists to make this feel fresh and provide a quick fun outing.  The tension of when to commit is still there, as is the angst of seeing cards you need go by.  The shift to the pawns climbing their rungs adds a nice touch, as does the addition of the tiles that can allow small manipulations to the basic movement, and also provide additional ways to score or prevent opponents from doing so.  Keltis is a neat design, one that I have enjoyed more with each of my plays so far.  I like the green, and the presentation of the game.  Not sure a Lost Cities remix will improve this one.

It's really luck-driven, pushing it into the family game corner, but for that the low degree of direct player interaction largely disqualifies it.

RATING: 8.9
A quintessential gateway game. I own the new German edition, which features a double-sided board and tiles for two different games: Keltis and Neue Wege Neue Ziele (also known as Keltis Erweiterung). The first Keltis is rather simple and ideal for new and occasional players, but allows for a certain degree of strategic thought, especially if players focus on maximising the efficiency of the clover leaf tiles.

Neue Wege Neue Ziele is less luck-driven, not so much more complex to learn and a wonderful step up for more experienced players. 

If you can track the new German edition, you'll really get the most bang for your buck. Recommended!

2-player rating, Keltis ascending/descending rules. Like this one much, much more than the card game from which it is derived. 

As far as design, give me the original soothing green Keltis over the rainbow kaleidoscope of LC:TBG. The point inflation of the the latter is also an unwelcome change. But who am I to talk -- I made my own version from Trumpet cards and assorted scraps.

I prefer the Lost Cities Board Game rules where expeditions must be played from low to high.  Although the Keltis rules do remove some of the luck, they also remove a lot of the decisionmaking and tension.  And the tension is already disappointingly low compared to Lost Cities.

But with either set of rules, this game's not a keeper for me.

Another hard to understand pick from the Jury for SdJ. Basicly it's kind of a patience game because the main mechanism is arranging cards according to their number in a row. Keltis is much too luck dependent to be a gamers game and it lacks of a theme. It's really hard to believe that this game should be able to motivate nongamers to get into our hobby, but then they are not as demanding as gamers are. However, if one likes the game, it surely has a great replayability.

Big improvement over original lost cities, and a OK game in its own right.  Hand management card game that uses a board to score and add a little bit of extra strategic complexity that wasn't there in lost cities.  Easier to score and more paths to victory than lost cities.  Same difficulty level as ticket to ride.  No replay value, but good as a gateway or light game, good for non-gamers, and good to play twice a year or so.  A mechanism that lets everyone have an equal number of turns might have been a good mechanism as you can really be hurt by getting cut off just before landing your final big score.  Going first the next turn may or may not be a good consolation prize.

Its totally themeless and the components, though high quality, are boring and add nothing to the game.

Very good adaptation of Lost Cities for 2 to 4 players. 4 Players feels too chaotic for my tastes.
Tiles are a bit thin and the graphics for stones are lacking (Kosmos edition).
That game is growing on me.    With players having played before, Keltis is verrrry fast.

Edit: upgraded score.  Keltis is really the best light game I own, because while the rules are extremely short, there is some meat on the bone.  This is one of the best family/gateway game ever.

Just what we've all been waiting for...Lost Cities with a board!!! It removes much of the tension from Lost Cities (more cards of each suit, and you can start expeditions low-moving-up or high-moving-down), adds a race aspect for those expeditions that have "luck stones", and increases the luck of the draw (fewer discards available, especially with 4 players). Despite this, I find it somewhat more fun than Lost Cities, but still leaves me lukewarm.

An attractive multi-player version of Lost Cities with the option of playing your cards in ascending or descending sequence.

If you only allow sequences to go upwards then, as high cards aren't worth more (as in Lost Cities), getting lots of high cards early is too painful. If you also allow sequences to go downwards then, with 3 opponents, there is almost never a card that is safe to discard. This, combined with the fact that it is much easier to avoid a negative score, means that you have much less realistic choice than in Lost Cities, and the game is worse as a result.

Great intro game.  My family, especially my wife, loves this game.  Only the second, maybe third game, that she has ever asked me to play.  Incredible!
Not something I personally would want to play a great deal, ( I like stuff somewhat more challenging) but you can bet it will be a family favorite for awhile.

SOLD Once you've played Lost Cities this game just seems a little bit too contrived to try to branch the concept out to more than 2 players. Looks pretty ... gets a little boring after you play it more than once.

RATING: 5
Inferior to Lost Cities.  Less decisions, less taking risks etc.  You more or less play what you have in your hand (rarely discarding or picking up discarded cards) and that's it.  I played only 3-4 player games and these impressions apply to them.  If with 2 players is different I don't care too much.  I'll just play Lost Cities instead.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (December 2012)

To be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about the game. I remember I didn’t like it very much, too much randomness. I prefer to play Lost Cities as it is a two player game only. 

I will play again and when I do I will give a proper comment.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 5
There's nothing too offensive about Keltis, and its graphics are charming.  But the game loses a little in its transition to multiplayer board form.  Even the minimal time one has to refine a hand in Lost Cities is gone given the superfast endgame condition.  Unfortunately, this reduces the scope for decisionmaking and makes the game result even more determined by a player's starting hand than Lost Cities is.

Perhaps Keltis is better with 2 or 3, but it's definitely not a winner with 4.

As expected, Keltis is better with more players. 7/10ish.
---
Keltis is Lost Cities ported to a boardgame format. The board adds a race effect to get the bonus tiles. At the same time gameplay is less tight through fewer restrictions and multiple cards of every kind but not necessarily worse than Lost Cities. 
Played with two, it provides a bit more variety than Lost Cities while at the same time the tile distribution can up the random factor. But it's not different enough to cure my tiredness  of Lost Cities after playing it too many times. The true advantage of Keltis seems to lie in the multiplayer format which I haven't tried yet.

Very good game from R.Knizia, all the people that played it said it was good and wanted to play one more... Collect cards with same symbols and move your tokens up to the top of the board to be the one with more points at the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I think I've finally settled on the conclusion that Keltis has a lot more luck than Lost Cities.  The extra tokens are fun (though the "advance one space" are by far the most powerful), and help to determine which lines might be more attractive.  But having a lucky opening hand is an almost overwhelming advantage, and I think that the amount of luck in the card draws is much higher than in Lost Cities, since there are more players.  Discarding is a less viable option with more players, and it is also much more difficult to try and stall at the end of the game.  So I find Keltis to be a solid game, but ultimately less fun than I originally thought.

Update: Having played all the different Keltis spin-offs shows how weak of a game the original Keltis is.  The cardgame version is so much better, with a lot less chrome.  Keltis is really only worth playing with the expansion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A 4-player version of the very popular Lost Cities. The feel of the old game is here, but the extra tokens seem to detract from the original elegance. It feels a bit more clunky. And because the theme has never been strong (it really is an abstract game), I find I don't enjoy this as much.

Good abstract game that oddly enough rewards playing badly (you don't want to get all your pieces on the board since 3/5 or so will then give you negative points and those that don't, generally won't score that high).

Also, quite a bit of luck involved with regards to cards dealt and how the special tiles are allocated.

But still fun!

Keltis: A card game with a board that has a fair amount of luck. With 4 players, very few cards are discarded so the cards you are dealt or draw will impact you options quite a bit. Efficient use of the different tiles that are randomly distributed at the begging of the game can be helpful, but bad cards can be hard to overcome. Getting the large pawn to the end spot should be a top priority in terms of maximum points. Overall, it is a fun family game that is easy to teach and play.

r{I have Keltis, but I think I wouldn't mind getting Lost Cities the Board Game either.}r

As billeted, it feels a lot like Lost Cities. My biggest attraction to this game was the art. There was just something appealing to all the green and clover shapes. Like LC the game shares the same risk/reward quality. With the tiles that are added to the board randomly which score points, give extra moves or score more points at the end of the game in the case of the wishing stones, it makes the decisions to be made a bit tougher.

Superb translation of Lost Cities into a 4-player board game. The trick is that the core of the game, hand management and risk assessment, remains the same, which is ideal, as Lost Cities is one of the all-time greats. I'm indifferent about the new, abstract theming used here, but it doesn't get in the way at all. The expansion board, now packaged with the base game, is even better!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.6
Not the best Knizia but a well-balanced game with nice components and clear rules. Actually I'm a bit happy that it earned the Spiel des Jahres instead of the very trendy Stone Age.
Something strange: while this one is really different, it really feels like Ingenious - with much more beautiful components and a little bit more depth. Strange, but for some reason I might prefer this one to Ingenious. Actually it gets better and better every time.

Update: it started with 7, then 7.2, 7.4 and now (2008.10.12) it is 7.6. I bought it two days ago after several plays with friends; played it with my 66-year-old mom on Sat, also my wife on Sun, and both of them wanted to repeat immediately. THAT's what I call a SdJ quality.

I didn't expect to like this one, but the game surprised me and it is solid family fare.  Fairly light but with enough going on with quick game play makes it somewhat engaging, much to my surprise!  There's still no way I'll pay the $50 for the import, but the Rio Grande version is very affordable.  My biggest concern about this game is that someone always seems to get hosed by this game and there's little they can do about it.

I'm beginning to have some reservations about this game - I am beginning to lose interest in it and would prefer other family fare than this one.

I've played once with the Keltis variant where you can choose to either build upwards or downwards - did not like this at all as it takes away some of the gaming and strategic choices.  This pretty much means any card you discard will be wanted by someone as well as giving much more freedom for people to initially push their luck in a color path they may not otherwise have chosen.

RATING: 4
Hárman játszottuk, amit nagyjából ideálisnak érzek hozzá, de a játék nem igazán fogott meg. A játékelemek szépek, a játékidő rövid (kb. 20-30 perc, ha már ismerjük a szabályokat), a szabályok egyszerűek és elsőre megérthetőek.

A játék maga viszont elég gyenge. Kártyák húzunk nagyjából véletlenszerűen, öt színben, és színenként számsorokat kell képeznünk. Amikor bővítjük valamelyik számsort, akkor az adott szín vonalán egy mezővel előre lép a bábunk. Az a játékos kap sok pontot, aki a legtöbb ösvényen a legtöbbször jár legelöl (ő kapja meg az ösvény adott mezőin lévő bónuszokat, a később érkezők már nem kapnak semmit). A játék túlságosan szerencsefüggő: ha jó lapokat kap az elején valaki, meg jókat húz hozzá, valószínű, hogy nyerni is fog. És fordítva: rossz lapokat kapva és rosszakat húzva teljesen valószínűtlen, hogy nyerni lehessen.

Azon kívül, hogy a szemnek szép, könnyen tanulható és gyors játékról van szó az tetszett még benne, hogy az egyik speciális mezőfajtára lépve picit megkapja a játék irányításának a lehetőségét az adott játékos: a négylevelű lóhere lapra érkezve egy tetszőleges bábuját egyel előre tolhatja. Ez lehetőséget ad egy cseppnyi stratégiázásra, nem pedig az van, hogy a kézben lévő lapoktól függően gyakorlatilag a játék játszatja magát, a játékosokat statisztaként felhasználva.

Vannak hát előnyös tulajdonságai a játéknak, de játékélményben szerintem gyenge, és ez súlyos hibája.

Nem fogom keresni az alkalmat, hogy máskor is játszhassak vele, mert nem nyújt sokat, bár nem is rossz. Talán néha, ha valami nagyon egyszerű játékkal lenne kedvem játszani, akkor leülnék hozzá, vagy ha valaki nagyon ezzel akarna játszani, akkor is, de inkább egy ismeretlen, vagy szinte bármelyik már ismert másik játékkal játszanék, mint ezzel.

Mit jeder weiter ausgelegten Karte darf die eigene Spielfigur ein Feld auf dem entsprechenden Steinpfad vorrücken. 
Auf jedem Pfad liegen sogenannte Wegekärtchen offen aus. Wer ein solches Kärtchen erreicht, darf entweder direkt ein paar Schritte auf der Zählleiste vorrücken, erhält Punkte am Spielende oder darf eine beliebige Figur ein Feld vormarschieren lassen.

RATING: 6
Awesome game that's so simple you can use it as gateway game to gateway games, if you think TTR is too much to start with. All you have to know is numbers and the rest of the game is pretty classic racing. It's a bit dry game to play often, but for this purpose alone it's a keeper for us. The expansion board makes the game a lot more varied, so it's manadatory if you play this more than once or twice a year (with new players stick to the basic!).

2-Player Comment:
* Keltis works well with two. I even prefer it to it's 2p ancestor Lost Cities.

After the first play, I really liked this game, but I was already bored with it by the second play.  The cards you draw basically determine which paths you're going to venture down, which eliminates much of the strategy of the game.  Usually, the person who wins is the one who drew the best, which doesn't make for very entertaining gameplay.

The first time a played I didn't really get what the appeal of the was.

Having played again a couple of years later I can now see some of the charm. It's really a kind of race in the same vein as it's big brother Lost Cities. There are some tactical possibilities and some luck. The (thin) theme and artwork still don't really do much for me, though.

My opinion of the game has improved but I'm still take-it-or-leave-it.

After reading some of the reviews of Keltis I was initially skeptical about it hearing that it didn't have the same tension as Lost Cities.  I found that it was just as intense.  Sure there's still luck involved and some of that can increase based on what your opponents do but overall it's a great multi-player rendition of Lost Cities.  

The board is great because it reduces the math and some bonuses tiles were added (chits you gain for being the first to a goal in one suit).  

If Lost Cities is the perfect game to play with the wife then Keltis may be the perfect game for polygamists.

With many of the same elements as Lost Cities the card game, the board game adds a little more.  Good light game.  Can play the short version (1 round) or long version (3 rounds).  A game that my kids and adults can both get into.
Cons: starting hands can really help or hurt you sometimes.  Long version gives you a little chance to catch back up if you have a bad starting hand in 1 round.

The board is beautiful and the overall design is consistent with the theme.  While it seems to be "Lost Cities for 3 or 4," it works very well for 2.  I expect this will hit the table often.

I have picked up the Lost Cities version and much prefer the artwork - I find the green/grey color scheme of the Keltis cards much harder to see with my slight color-vision deficiency.  The option to play one or three rounds is also a plus.

Solid family game. Worth the Spiel des Jahres, definitely. The scoring is easier than in Lost Cities, which is a nice thing, and the game is more interesting. Well done.

In the end, Keltis is still rather bland. Lost Cities is perhaps a bit more interesting, and I think the idea probably works slightly better with two players. I still have Lost Cities, but I traded Keltis away.

Like it better than Lost Cities (I got the Rio Grande edition, which I think has better graphic designs than Keltis).  Granted that the tension and the calculation for the card game is probably higher than the boardgame but the tokens and the simplified scoring makes this game much more fun and enjoyable and on top of that it supports up to 4 players.  What more can you ask from a great game...  Hmmm, perhaps a 5th player expansion?

A much better game with 3 or 4 players than with 2.  Quite a good game with a bit of sunstance but a silly and very weak theme.

Superb translation of Lost Cities into a 4-player board game. The trick is that the core of the game, hand management and risk assessment, remains the same, which is ideal, as Lost Cities is one of the all-time greats. I'm indifferent about the new, abstract theming used here, but it doesn't get in the way at all. The expansion board, now packaged with the base game, is even better!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun, but pales next to Lost Cities. The major issue is that in Lost Cities you can finesse the discard piles to play your hand better. In Keltis, almost ANY discard is useful to another player, making the luck of the draw much more important. If you don't get the cards you need to play on your runs, you are helping your opponents every time you have to discard. Using the only up or down variant is a must, or just get Lost Cities The Board Game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Bought it specially to play with my mum - since it is language independent. However, don't get the good feel about the game - might try this game out in a 4 players game again!

High chance of trading it away for some other games! A big disappointment after reading good reviews of Lost Cities card game, the board game seems like a diluted version of the card game - marketing gimmick to sell thru success of the card game!

Nice easy game, fun to play.  Just a bit too much luck and little strategical options for my taste. I like to play it, in any case. It is similar in feeling to Lost Cities (if you like Lost Cities, you would like this too).

My taste have changed a bit with the years passing, so I am much less attracted to play games like this at the moment.

Lost Cities the boardgame really. I never liked scoring in Lost Cities. Too much substraction and multiplication. Keltis fixes this problem and adds possibility to play with 3 or 4 players. I think this is a better incarnation of the game. There is some extra randomness as the tiles are randomly distributed and you might not be able to play to some colors. I like changed mechanic that you can play colors from high to low or vice versa.

What works well in a light 2 player format doesn't translate so well to 3 or 4 players. With more players, there's rarely safe discards so players are encouraged to play more in hope - just play the cards you get and hope for more of that colour later, and hoping you can avoid the colours of the player on your right. Resulting in less decision tension. In retrospect, the winner invariably received a lucky run of cards to maximise their suit, so this game resigns itself to braindead filler time territory, where it's certainly pleasant enough.

This plays very different from Lost Cities (the card game) but is still similar enough that it satifies my craving for it. This plays 2-4 players, which tells me that the game play is different depending on the number of players since the deck is finite. I wish I grew up with this game.

Quality beautiful board game with cards and pieces. Good feel. Quick plays for people that understand how it works. Still, pasted on Knizia theme. I desperately want to try this with the Neue Wege, Neue Ziele expansion.

It has some similarities to the two player card game, but as a four player game, it loses some of its edge.

A lot more appealing than Lost Cities. I'd rather play this game because of the diversity compared to Lost Cities. The board is yet again too big but this time not completely useless.

The game is of course abstract but I really enjoyed the shallow Celtic theme it had. The shades of darker green really make a beautiful board.

My complaint about the game is same than that with Lost Cities: at times too random. The current hand size is just too small to make some decisions not totally luck-dependent.

Yep, the cardplay that makes Lost Cities so enjoyable and addictive is still there: the holding off and speculating of narrowing the gaps in the sequence, the silent kick in the pants when you draw the card value you've passed. But if you felt the pressure in the cardgame as the drawpile depleted, Keltis pushes you in the back for a couple of reasons: now there is a second game end condition to look out for and there are stones to pick up otherwise you lose points, and with others breathing down your neck for these means you feel more forced to jump large gaps in the sequence. But the more interesting thing about the boardgame variant is that there are a couple of things to overcome a bad hand: you can go backwards sequentially, there are spots on the board to move any scoring marker up and likewise if you play cards for markers at the end of that path. Add to this that the game is far easier to score than it's convoluted predecessor makes no surprise why this won SdJ.

Keltis seems to suffer from Zooloretto syndrome: it doesn't offer enough over the related card game to justify the big box. I'd like to try the expansion though, as I've heard that makes it more of a 'real' board game.

RATING: 6
Lost Cities in name only. My disappointment stems from expecting a cleaner 4-player version of the 2-player card game. I can see the point tracks but don't see play value in the chits - just adds randomness where it isn't needed. Would have made more sense to carefully balance the chit values and pre-print them on the board so people can make informed choices.

One very good adaptation of Lost Cities the card game. There is a little bit more options in the game mechanic than Lost Cities the card game. The material is O.K. and the rules are very simple. It plays itself in less than 30 minutes, that's another neet feature. I think that Lost Cities the card game will come out a little bit less often, since my girlfriend likes it.

Lost Cities with a celtic theme and some positional boardplay scoring
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I like it, it's fast and easy, though I have a feeling Knizia was trying to fit too many mechanics into this game. So there's the basic "Lost Cities" card drawing theme, but then there's the board with different trails and bonuses. Luck seems to be a bigger factor than in "Lost Cities" - not only you need to draw the right cards, but also cards of the right track (because sometimes one will be a lot better than the other). 

Long story short, more often than not the most lucky player wins. Still, it plays fast and doesn't force you to think too hard. It can be fun sometimes, but definatelly not as your main game.

UPDATE: Naw, it's just bleh...

Very nice family game.

However since being more of a wargamer the appeal is not going to rate it higer than 6,5 hence the rating score of 6. The theme is in fact non existant it could as well have been artwork about planes, trains or pigs for that matter. In other words it basically is a unthemed game with some (PRETTY DARN GOOD) artwork based on 4 leaved clovers and Celtic images.

Abstract game, which is essentially laying rows of cards with some board representation of this. It is extremely luck based, if you got a decent hand (and this very much sets your available options what you could do) and there is also a not-mitigated starting player advantage. Beyond that it is easy too teach and allows quick and casual play, there is really nothing special about this game.

A surprise hit, I actually enjoy this more than Lost Cities the card game. It's light, quick, and tense, and simple enough for families and nongamers. I first played Keltis and I have to say I much prefer the layout and graphic design of that version. (I'm partial to green.) The scarcity and price of Keltis caused me to break down and buy the Lost Cities version, and although I think the starfish layout and colors are harder to read, the game works fine. I'm still trying to decide whether the original Keltis ascending/descending rules or the restrictive Lost City ascending-only rules work better.

I particularly dislike Lost Cities, so I had sided Keltis as a retheme without value for me.

It is quite significantly more enjoyable however, mostly due to the reduced luck of the draw (ascending+descending sequences) and push your luck element (a single x2 multiplier 'run').

It does remain a game I'd only play if asked, or possibly in bed pass-and-play with the girlfriend.

Lost Cities: the Board game

Pretty for sure, and it does feel a bit like Lost Cities the Card game.  This game however is less about hand management than it is about luck of the draw.  With multiple copies of each card in the deck it felt kind of hopeless to try an manage what you might expect.  Also with 3 rounds this can go a bit long.  AP is also a problem though i've never understood why a simple discarded card can so radically change someones strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
(Keltis version) Multiplayer Lost Cities variant. High luck factor, which is ok for a light family game. Rating is for 4-player games.

Personally I think, the synergy effects from a lucky hand of cards combined with a favorable token distribution can be much too strong here. 

L.C. and "Tal der Abenteuer", a Reiner game with similar mechanisms, level out the luck factor with 3 (L.C.) respectively 2 (T.d.A.) consecutive plays and then adding up the "sub-scores"  to the final score of the game (Update: in Rio Grande's own LCBG, this has been implemented. Wise move!). While L.C. offers keeping track of the cards and a direct opponent, T.d.A. has multiple winning possibilities, like many Reiner games. Keltis has none of that, so sometimes the winner can be determined halfway through the game. And discarding cards to influence the speed of the game (which was an important possibility in the original game) is barely an interesting option anymore, except you want to play 'cooperative', LOL.
With two players Keltis feels a bit pointless- I still prefer the original Lost Cities.  

I'm very happy, that Reiner finally got the SdJ award for this one, although there have been MANY of his lighter designs, that should have got this commendation instead. But then, after the SdJ 2008 probably the game publishers in Germany will recommence to release big box gamers' games by R.K. which they haven't done since Blue Moon City...

Nem mondom, hogy rossz játék, de fenti díjat nem érzem megalapozottnak. Nagyon kniziás játékmenet, szép grafika, de én túlságosan absztraktnak érzem. A dobozos változat a kártyajáték megjelenésével számomra értelmét vesztette (sokkal több helyet foglal, drágább, és nem nyújt nagyságrenddel nagyobb élményt a praktikus kártyás kistestvéréhez képest).

Plays quickly and is light enough for GFs and wives but still interesting enough for gamers. There's less motivation to discard a card here since you can help problematic expeditions by boosting them from others. IMHO the rule where it is possible to come down instead of increasing the number should not be used. If you can go only up (or down) the game becomes a bit tighter and discarding becomes more interesting.

It is like the multiplayer boardgame version of Lost Cities. Ok, not quite, it just borrows a key design concept, namely playing sequential cards in five different colors in a way that forces you to decide on the value of investing in each color. But there are enough other wrinkles for it to be a unique game, not as  elegant as its predecessor but still good.

I would like to see if this plays better as a team game - two on two. Yep, multi-player Lost Cities. The introduction of the tiles does serve as a hurry up for players. Your game will probably be as good as your cards and it's a decent offering - bland, but decent. Me, I prefer games with a bit of a theme and I think families looking for the Spiel des Jahres winner do too. This game plays well, but there's an empty feeling at the end of, "oh well, that's that then". There's no colourful story to tell at the end, just "my bit got to that tile first", or "I skipped over a whole bunch of numbers to get to that tile before you". At least they could have tacked on a pizza delivery / franchise theme, or something. I'm thinking of offer a service to Mr Knizia - you come up with the mechanics and I'll tack on a theme that doesn't suck.

A redesign of [i]Lost Cities[/i], but way better than this one, specially because of the strategy that the tiles add.  A lot more options, now it feels that players control the game, not that the game plays them, as the original did. Comparing [i]Keltis[/i] with [i]Lost Cities: The Board Game[/i], they are esencially the same, but I think that maybe the more sober graphic design adds to the appeal of the first and helps newbies to give it a try.

Vastly inferior to Lost Cities - I thought I'd like a multiplayer Lost Cities, but the fact that it's multiplayer, and the design of the paths on the board, really take away the strategy and tension of the 2 player game.

I bet 2 player Keltis is probably decent, but 3/4 player borders on the very definition of being a game. It all comes down to whether you draw the right cards or not, and there's precious little you can do about it. Unlike 2 player, where the discard mechanism makes more sense, and unlike Lost Cities where the danger of starting an expedition is real and palpable.

I was extremely happy to see that Knizia had finally been awared to the SdJ.  Because of that, this was a game that I knew would find its way into my collection.  I also went ahead and tracked down the very green German version (Keltis) rather than waiting for the RGG Lost Cities version.

Overall, I like the game.  It is hard to miss the similarities to Lost Cities given that it uses the same base engine to move the game along.  I do like the fact that the scoring is much simplified.  While I had no problems calculating scores in Lost Cities, for a multi-player family game, the ease of the scoring system here seems more applicable.  I also like the change of allowing cards to be in ascending and descending order as well as doubling the number of cards available.  

Overall an interesting enough family game.  My kids like it.  In fact, I nearly lost my first game to my six-year-old who was playing mostly randomly.  It kept me on my toes.  [11/12/2008]

After 1 play...

I'm not a fan of Lost Cities, which I rate just a 5. This seems to be an improvement in several ways, and could possibly climb a bit higher (though I doubt it'll ever be a 7 for me):
- it plays up to 4; we rarely play 2-player games any more, so that is definitely a plus.
- much easier to calculate scores! Very simple math, no complications about using 8 cards giving you a bonus, subtracting 20, etc ... it's all right there on the board!
- being able to play in ascending or descending order. Not certain that this is a good thing, though, as it seems as though a lot of tension may be lost?

--- Summary ---
There are 2 each of cards 0-10 in 5 suits. Players have 4 regular score markers and 1 double marker. There are 5 paths on the board, 1/suit. Each path is seeded with randomly distributed tiles which either provide bonuses when a token lands on them (1-3 VP, or move any token an additional space on the path) or are collected for end-game scoring. Players get 8 cards each (some random cards removed from game if playing with fewer than 5).

On your turn, either discard a card to it's color discard stack, or add it to your personal path for that color. If adding to a path, cards may either be played in ascending order or descending (dupes can always play on each other). Move the player marker one step along the path whenever a card is played; if the marker is at the end of its path, move any of your other markers forward one step. Then, draw the top card from the deck or any of the discard piles.

The game ends the instant the 5th marker crosses into the end zone (last few steps on each path) -- do NOT activate/collect the token at that step -- or when the draw deck is exhausted. Score VP according to position on paths, and collection of shamrock tokens. Most VP wins.

Update: I've played about a dozen games now, and my rating is starting to settle. Keltis is a fun, short and tight game. It's a typical Knizia game, which means a strong focus on hand management, risk assessment and timing. Although it's clearly based on Lost Cities, it's not derivative. Having said that, I think Lost Cities is the better two-player game, because it's a lot more intense. Keltis has much more cards and card play is more flexible, so that the decisions tend to be a lot easier. No more forced discards!
With three or four, Keltis is a lot of fun and I would really recommend it with those numbers. Each turn gives you a lot of choices: which tracks to invest in, when to discard cards, when to go for a specific tile, when to force the game end or postpone it, etcetera. All that in less than 30 minutes. I would really be disappointed if this didn't win the Spiel des Jahres.
**
Rating based on two plays. Another very good, possibly truly great medium-weight game by Knizia. It's definitely reminiscent of Lost Cities, but has less risk management and more timing issues. Loved my first plays and rating may well rise.

This is a fun take on multiplayer lost cities--it has elements of lost cities in the way you lay down cards, but there is actually quite a bit more strategery in how you move to get onto the bonus tiles, and how you progress to the top level to get those effectively 'wild card' moves.

[Kosmos 'Keltis' 08 edition] Umm... I finally got a chance to try Keltis.  Lost Cities, the board game is the better edition.  LCtB provides more tension and 3 rounds of play mitigate the luck and provide strategic planning.

In addition, I prefer the illustration of LCtB.

L’antica saggezza celtica si applica ai percorsi della vita: ogni essere umano attraversa una realtà negativa per giungere ad una radiosa e positiva. Potrai spostarti sui vari sentieri di pietra usando le carte giuste, avanzando lungo un sentiero avrai la possibilità di ottenere più punti. Di volta in volta dovrai decidere se intraprendere un nuovo percorso o insistere sul vecchio, potrai anche decidere di scartare carte ma, attenzione, gli avversari potrebbero approfittare di questa opportunità. Ogni partita resterà tesa ed emozionante fino alla fine.

Vincitore dello Spiel des Jahres 2008 per la sua semplicità, Keltis, il nuovo ed entusiasmante gioco di Reiner Knizia, è ispirato alla simbologia Irlandese. Lo scopo del gioco è far avanzare in 5 percorsi di pietre di diverso colore le proprie pedine per giungere ad una realtà radiosa e positiva.

Un semplice gioco di carte, dotato di una grafica accattivante che ha, però, logiche di movimento e di scelta dei percorsi che può piacere anche ai giocatori più esperti.

Le regole sono molto semplici e immediate. Ogni partita resterà tesa ed emozionante fino alla fine.

Elenco elementi di gioco:
1 Mappa da gioco
110 Carte
20 Pedine
4 Segnaposti
4 Segnapunti

After three 4-player games, I'm not sure about this one, and it's not just because I lost so badly in the 3rd game. Inevitably, it'll be compared to Lost Cities, and the initial comparison isn't that good. Taking note of 3 players' played cards is much harder than taking note of one player's cards, so discards are less well considered. The option of playing cards ascending or descending also throws this somewhat (though I guess choosing to start colours already started by other players in reverse order might be a good idea). The other thing that niggles is that card values don't matter (theres no Lost Cities style scoring). All that matters is the quantity of cards in a colour.

Despite all those reservations, I find myself enjoying Keltis more & more and thinking of Lost Cities less & less.

tl;dr: solid, but I prefer [thing=50][/thing]

When this came out, I had been playing Lost Cities for a while. I like that game a lot. Getting to play that multi-player is nice, but Reiner made some changes. And in most of those cases I prefer the way Lost Cities did it.
The ability to play the cards in either order is more family friendly, but I quite like the idea of knowing that the other player will have to play in the same order as you
Playing the hand cards adds so much tension because it ups the stakes. What if you don't get the cards you need to get above 20? The punishment in Keltis for starting a new color is not nearly as big.
The addition of the stone collecting seems a bit like an afterthought.
That being said: this is still a solid game, I just don't enjoy it as much as the short, fast, clean Lost Cities

Ah, more Knizian hand management, set collection.

I was possibly expecting too much from this game and was somewhat disappointed when I played it for the first time last night.  The artwork is very nice, but nothing special.  The play lacks something of the immediacy of Lost Cities.  There was quite a lot of down time as players thought hard about their goes.  Because some strands are building up (0-10) and others are building down (10-0)it is very diffficult to ever throw a card out.  Play finishes after relatively few turns, so it is more of a race game.  Maybe my opinion will pick up when I have played it more.

While I prefer the one set of cards in Lost Cities (which provides a more tense experience), the board play in Keltis adds another dimension that requires both added tactical decisions and often more bold plays, as players try to hoard the gemstones or combo extra movements. I also prefer the theme; while the idea of exploring in Lost Cities is fitting, it doesn't draw away from the abstract experience. Whereas Keltis feels as though I am playing a mystical, ancient abstract Celtic game.

I like Lost Cities, and this game was pretty much what I had expected - a good translation of a two-player card game into a multi-player board game. And yet ... I was disappointed in this one. Where the two-player card games is full of tension and tough decisions, most of the excitement seems gone in Lost Cities: The Board Game. This works fine, but for me it lacked fun and challenge.

RATING: 6.5
Heavy luck, but it is a fun game. I'm really not sure that there is much skill to the game as the cards drawn are the primary factor to how well one does. The components are very nice, the board well laid out and the game is very easy to play. I'm not sure, but I might prefer the travel version of this as it plays more quickly and doesn't take too much away from the base game. I have the expansion board on order, so that may improve the overall game play of the board version.

Some people around me love it but after 50+ plays I am forced to admit that it's a rather hollow non-gamers game with inadequate strategy involved. It still flows well and plays quick (10mins with my wife), so under no circumstances is this a bad filler. 

It is however absolutely perfect for what it is: a gateway game.

About [thing=34585][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=34585][/thing] is a set collection and push your luck board game, basically going one step further than that of [thing=50][/thing] , not only in options, but also in number of players: now up to four. The goal changed: from the cards themselves earning points, to using cards to advance on tracks and gaining points from bonuses along the path and due to the place the player's markers are and the end of the play.

In [thing=34585][/thing] players have more control over their destiny, still needing some luck in the draw of cards, but spots that allow for a free advancement, the possibility of starting a path with high cards and going down and the having two cards of each number, counter the randomness to a point.

The production value is OK: the board, tokens and cards are serviciable - nothing really stands out, for bad or for good. Replay value is high: the randomness of the draw deck and the random set up for the bonuses and stones make for a fine amount of variation between plays.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
There are five tracks, each of a color. In each some tokens are randomly added - the tokens are of three types: extra advancement, luck stone and bonus points. After the set up, each player receives 8 cards. Every player have 4 small markers and one big marker.

To advance in a track the player simply plays a card of the corresponding color. To start in a track, any color will do, but afterwards, the player must either go up in number, down or be the same. Once a direction (up or down) is definied, the player must always follow it - therefore, with the progression of the game, some cards won't be able to be added to your set of cards.

Instead of using a card to advance in a track, the player can discard a card from hand. This card will be available to the other players to draw, instead of drawing from the deck. After the player either played or discarded a card, she can draw from the deck or one discarded card - then her turn is over.

If a player reaches a token in a track, she gains its ability immediately - the extra advancement and the bonus points tokens remain in the board; the luck stones are taken by the players and will be worth points at the end of the game.

The first three spots in each track are worth negative points.

Play ends as soon as a number of markers pass a scoring frontier. Each small marker will give the points equal to the place they are in (which can be negative) - the big marker will earn double the points. Sets of luck stones will also be worth points - and player without them or too few, will lose points instead.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which track to risk. This takes into consideration not only the cards in hand (not onyl, but mostly), but also what the track itself has: the tokens it has and what positions. Later in the game is also possible to see what cards the other player already used and what are your chances of going in the distance in a given track;
- When and what card to discard. In order to give yourself more room to grow, discard a card instead of playing one can be the right choice. Still, giving an open card to someone else, more than in Lost Cities, can give and important edge - therefore, one must choose carefully;
- Where to advance. The token that allows for an extra advancement does its thing in any track, meaning is possible to estimate the possibilities of going better or worse in a given track, using the bonus advancement to prevent negative points, to reach a luck stone, etc.

The decisions, on themselves, aren't hard to make, but the push your luck aspect and the uncertainty of getting the needed cards, add some extra tension to them.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Language independent;
- Escales well from 2 to 4 players;
- Works both for family and with board gamers;
- Downtime normally isn't an issue, even when playing with 4.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Luck of the draw can decide the winner;
- Some frustration may be in order, when luck (and your plans) fails you.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like in a contest of how many times can you play a card, draw a card that now you can't play and that you could use instead of the one you just did, and not curse out loud. It is truly harder than it seems. Not everyone can handle well this exercize in frustration and, if you don't, avoid [thing=34585][/thing] might be the way to go.

Overall, [thing=34585][/thing] is an easy going game, with a racing aspect to get the luck stones, and loads of pushing your luck around - not every plan will find its mark nor every risk decision will fail. Still, the pacing is good, there are choices to be made and all inside a short playing time frame. If you like [thing=50][/thing], there is little chance with going wrong with [thing=34585][/thing].

So much worse than the original Lost Cities, quite dissapointing! I would bet that the game is pretty much decided with the opening hand (at least in the sense that if you get a horrible start, there's not much you can do). Compared to Lost Cities, many mechanics just strengthen the leader - people who are left behind by bad card draw have very little change to catchup.

I also like how relaxing it is and the whole time playing it, you feel like you are playing an actual ancient Celtic board game. I know it's a re-implementation of the Lost Cities board game, but I just prefer this one more.

I think this is as good as Lost Cities could have been in multi-player form. Nonetheless, there is just something about the zero-sum aspect of play in Lost Cities that here has been diluted and obfuscated. With more players there seems to be a greater tendency to get in most if not all colors, at which point your game is almost completely scripted. I also found the 1-round game was too short, while the 3-round game was clearly too long. Unfortunately the scoring system is such that a 2-round game isn't feasible.

RATING: 7
Aside from making the Lost Cities design playable by more than 2 people, the game improves on the original design by giving players different things to try to achieve during the game via the bonus tiles.  It also turns the game into a race game of sorts, as it's vital to reach those tiles, and the more players you add to the game, the more difficult it becomes to get to them.  Additionally, having the option of going low-to-high or high-to-low gives a tactical edge to the game that's lacking some in the original game.  On the one hand, it allows for different strategies; on the other, it takes away a little of the tension that I like in the base game.  Additionally, the flow of the game is very different, since keeping up with three other players' cards is a little more trying than just keeping up with one opponent.  At the moment, it feels a little fiddly, but not so much that it's overwhelming.  The game works pretty well as is, and I look forward to future plays.

An abstract game that you try to create rows of numbers in order to go higher in a path. I did not like it very much but it is not so bad.

Multi-player "Lost Cities", but frankly I liked it much less than the old two-player only version.

Lots of games are saved by beautiful components, a nice board, great pieces...
Not this one, this game is saved by gameplay.  Theme is just ok, board ok, pieces ok, nothing more.  Could be better.
In this game you try to get your pieces on top of each of the 5 columns using the 'Lost Cities - mecanic'  Only this time you get to choose: ascending or descending.  Play a card, move your piece one step towards the top, 5 symbols, 5 pieces.  Some tokens allow you extra step or points.
Didn't expect to like it,but it's a good one.

RATING: 6.5
A good conversion from a very good two player game into a multiplayer game. The game mechanic is OK but Game of the Year 2008? Aren't we stretching things a bit? There is an effort to apply a "theme" on the game mechanism. Anyone who has played the original "Lost Cities" will see right through it. Ok game but remakes and sequels are almost always second best to the original.

Gioco di carte mascherato da boardgames, in cui bisogna collezionare carte e giocarle nella giusta seguenza per far avanzare i prorpi segnalini lungo un percorso costellato di bonus.

RATING: 9
Lost Cities with extra bits.  Board is very nice & colourful (Rio Grande) and cards are nice too. Love the Indiana Jones meeples! Game play is simple but quite tense. More decisions to make: timing of your playing cards to get to the artifacts first and make sure you maximise your points before the bridges are crossed. Much quicker game with 4 players than with 2.

Played Keltis and it will be how will play LCTBG in future.

RATING: 7.5
A good game - exactly what you expect it to be.  Differences from the card game are: (1) easier scoring, (2) "bonus" chits that change dynamics of game.  

3 players is different than 4.  With 3, you reach the 5 men over the bridge end condition a lot.  With 4, you reach the end of the deck end condition.  I think it is slightly better with 3.

Also, I enjoy this more than Lost Cities, the Boardgame.  I think having it set up for a 1 hand game, rather than a 3 hand game, is what this game deserves.  For one hand, I like this game.  For 3 hands, it is too long.

Like Lost Cities, but with a board, with more players, and with more strategy.
In fact, it removes the main problem I had with Lost Cities, i.e. getting stuck with a crappy hand. 
Now there are multiple mechanics to work around a crappy hand and still inch towards victory.

this game is much better with the new versions.
the problem here is the moment when you start to need to trash cards and hope for the better.. it becomes honestly boring... while it is very good at the beginning when you still have meaningful choices. If you wonder where to start, just go for neue wege or Orakel or Mittbringspiel

RATING: 4
As someone who enjoys Lost Cities, I was surprised to find how much I disliked the multiplayer version of the game.  Nearly all of the changes to the original game are misguided. In particular, the chits/rewards that are placed on the various expedition paths reward the players who happen to draw the expedition “suits” for those paths.  Turn order, too, becomes important, since being able to draw discarded cards is now turn-order dependent.

One positive change is that expeditions can go either low-to-high or high-to-low, which is critically important due to the fact that players need to advance up the tracks quickly to be even vaguely competitive.  (This wouldn’t work in the 2-player version, but it is necessary here.)  Regardless, unlike the original version, luck (rather than skill) is now the one and only factor that determines who happens to win.

Good variation on Lost Cities. The random tiles and card distribution change the game enough to keep it fresh.

RATING: 7.5
A good family game.

I much prefer the Lost Cities rules to the Keltis rules. I find that forcing card stacks to increase (instead of having the option of having stacks decrease) adds to the tension. I rate Lost Cities: TBG a point higher than Keltis.

RATING: 6.5
Good, solid light filler game.  Not one that should really be played repeatedly within a single sitting or at every game night, but still fun.   Most gamers will probably get bored with it after a few plays, but it's still enjoyable enough to pull out from time to time with non-gamers.

I like the artwork style of the board and components of Keltis far better than the Lost Cities: The Board Game version.

Very addictive game. It is very simple card placing game, but the board ads to it a bit, not to much, to make it simple party/family/filler game. Very short game time, so usually a group can play 3-4 games in a row in few hours and everyone has a chance to win.

I also have Keltis for PC, Keltis Gold for PC and the Schnupperspiele (teaser game).
Pretty straightforward, but still very addictive.
Unlike its expansion, this is a more mild game. Meaning there is less stress and painfull thinking.
We play with tokens face down.

RATING: 7
Fairly simple yet engaging. Collect and play cards in ascending or descending order to move your pieces up the matching colored paths.  There is a little set collection and a race element to going up the paths which gives you a little more to think about beyond your card play.  Best for gamers on the "New Ways" board... but still a good game for non-gamers on the original board. My rating is more for New Ways.

RATING: 7
An admirable attempt to translate the Lost Cities gameplay into a board game for four.  The tension between holding on to, laying down or discarding a card is still there.  However, even though the number of opponents have increased, your immediate concern is still only the person going after you.  With the exception of the clover leaf, I've found that the other path tiles to be completely superfluous and unnecessary.  Those points may matter in a close game, but if you get the right cards and play them well, they are practically meaningless.  Definitely a decent filler and a family-friendly title in terms of its accessibility.  Otherwise, it is nothing special.  For people that want to try Lost Cities but don't care for 2-player games, I'd recommend giving Keltis a go.

This is better playing by the [thing=42487][/thing] default rules, because it allows you to choose for each expedition whether it ascends or descends.  I suspect that if it's played at full speed, with people actually making next turn's choice immediately after they finish this turn, that it could be fully fun!

Переделка "Затерянных городов" на 2-4 человека. Игра прекрасно идёт и на двоих, и на четверых. Развитие игроков зависит только от них, много новых плоскостей соревнования (бонусы на клетках, оранжевые камни). Убраны "детские болезни" оригинала, например, часто выигрывал тот, кому пришли более крупные карты. 

Минусы - оформление суховатое, не семейное совсем, но и не геймерское. К процессу отношения не имеет. Игра дарит чистое соревнование и его прелести, но другого фана (фантазии, воображения) в игре нет.

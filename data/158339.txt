You cannot avoid comparing this game to Love Letter. It is nice how entertaining such a simple game can be. However, I prefer Love Letter over Lost Legacy mainly due to the fact that whereas in Lost Legacy you are mostly interacting with the deck, in Love Letter all interaction takes place between the players. It also felt like that in Lost Legacy the deduction part is easier as well.

I could play again, though.

RATING: 6
A sci fi themed micro game with the same look and feel as love letter that has many of the same mechanics and a few additional ones that I suppose are meant to make it more "gamer friendly". I wasn't that in to the game. I think love letter is better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Its Love Letter but with different cards and the barest hint of rules tweaks. Thought it would be cool to have Love Letter 2 as a change of pace, but this is too close and we end up just playing Love Letter instead.

RATING: 7
Another [b]Love Letter[/b] variant.  This time, it's space-themed, which didn't do much for me, but the art was alright.  Still good game play.  Quick and satisfying for a 16-card game that plays in 5 minutes!

best at 3+ players? ok with 2. 
the strategy is somewhat lacking: always go for "X" if possible; ignore almost all other cards.
Love Letter is clearly the better version of this type of game.

RATING: 7
A micro game a la Love Letter, but with a sci fi theme (meaning we might be more willing to play it).  The cards give a cool strategy but the draw mechanism makes it very random.  Looking forward to trying it with four people.

I'm really not a fan of Love Letter, and The Starship is better but not hugely so.  I do like that there's no immediate end-scoring, and that there's more room for clever play by placing the starship here or there.  But it's still too light for my tastes.

A variant on Flying Garden, this was the other Love Legacy deck AEG packaged on its own with a bag. Play alone, mix some of it with Flying Garden, mix them both together and remove one Legacy, there are already a number of things you can do with this and that was my attraction to the line.

Lost Legacy is akin to Love Letter: same designer, same publisher and same play material (16 cards and a lovely bag).
However, Lost Legacy feels more thinky than Love Letter: after the last card is drawn, if more than one player survives, an investigation phase begins and players (from the one holding the lowest card upward) try to guess the location of the lost legacy card.
It is like the gamer's version of Love Letter: still lightning fast (5 minutes per round), but with more room for bluffing and deduction, and fewer moments in which players feel played by the cards instead of playing them.

Score is an overall rating for all packs mixed together. For me the brilliance of this game is in the mixing of the sets. I feel you need to mix more than two for it to really come into its own, with a rich variety of card synergies and feel. For me it is Dominion meets Love Letter.

This is a very preliminary grade; I haven't played it that much yet. It certainly resembles Love Letter, but my initial impression is that it's less entertaining.

This is basically Love Letter 2.0 and I really like it!

It takes the basic gameplay mechanics of Love Letter, adds somethings here and removes somethings there and creates a fun little game.

I've been swept up in the microgame movement and this is one of the best.

Recently picked up the Flying Garden expansion and it's definatly a worth while expansion on the bsae game.

While having a different feel from Love Letter, this game has more decisions to make, and a higher degree of interplay between the cards. That makes it a better game for "gamers" but I'll still keep Love Letter around to play with mixed groups of gamers and non-gamers.

This is supposed to "fix" Love Letter? I don't see how. This game was actually more frustrating to me. Because Love Letter, if I lose, I lose, it feels mostly just pure chance. But in this game, I can know as much as my opponent where the Lost Legacy is or play just as optimally as they, but be forced to lose anyways. This isn't fixed Love Letter, this is frustrating Love Letter. And all the expansions just bloat and clutter it up.

RATING: 5
It has a similar game play style as Love Letter's draw a card and play one of two cards in your hand. It adds a middle area where cards can be drawn or placed by other players while they are looking for the Lost Legacy card.

It is a quick filler game that is a bit more complex than Love Letter but not by much. The strategies in both games are quite similar. The art is good.

Currently a 5 because it is not as good of a gateway game as Love Letter and I don't care to invest in a similar game of its type.

Plays like Love Letter but feels fresh.

Didn't like that the normal game lasts only one "round", so I quickly added 13 cubes to the game bag so we can play "campaign mode" (it's in the manual), which is like one play of Love Letter.

Want another deck so I can mix and match cards and/or play with 6 people.

I much prefer this version of Love Letter for the way it stretches the silliness even more with cards focused on eliminating other players. At the same time, there's a card that wins you the game if you look at the Lost Legacy. It's a 5 minute game so more chaos is just more fun here.

So far after just a couple of quick plays I think I'll like this game.

More plays are needed to see whether it has some depth.

I still think it's neat but my kids especially reach for Love Letter first, every time.

Another game that rips on the random chaos of 'Love Letter' and tries to do something a little different with it. LL:tS has all the stabbing-in-the-dark and immediate player elimination "fun" of Love Letter, with a rather inane winning scenario. Funny enough, this gets a few points for being a 5 minute game and doesn't overstay its welcome, even though this isn't my type of filler game. We even got through 3 rounds of it- so, playable, but largely unnecessary.

is this the love-letter killer that was foretold?
Not quite. At the same time that the theme makes it a little bit more interesting (particularly in the investigation phase) it also makes it harder to introduce to certain types of players, the game also becomes ever so slightly more complex.
For certain groups it should replace love letter, but it cannot replace it as a gateway game. As love letter, very good with 3-4 players.

Hits some of the same notes of Love Letter, but feels more engaging. The winner is the player who reveals the Lost Legacy card at the end of the game, not the person who got lucky with holding the best card at the end.

Can be mixed with cards from other Lost Legacy sets to vary gameplay.

RATING: 8
Lightning fast deduction card game by Seiji Kanai, designer of "Love Letter". With a deck of only 16 cards, under 10 mins gameplay (less than 5 mins for 2P!) and rules that can be memorised under 30 seconds (the game consists of only 2 phases: 1. Exploration - each player draws one card and then plays one card until the deck runs out of cards + resolve the card effect & 2. Investigation - lowest number card goes first), you can really ramp-up your "Lost Legacy" playing score!

During the game you will search for the "lost legacy", combining card effects with deduction (there's a limited number of cards, the number of identical cards is displayed on each card, the player discard piles are face up, so you're adjusting your tactics each round, trying to guess what card your opponent has in his hand, because you can score a victory very early on - in fact, if your opponents don't play their hands well, the game can end in just 1 minute. And sometimes, as stated in the rules, you are forced to play a card even if its effect is bad for you (for ex when one of the 2 cards in your hand is the "Lost Legacy", the other is "Assault", and you know for sure your opponent has "Sneak Attack").

There are several different decks that can be combined into megamix sets, and you can even build your own custom one. Each set comes with its own bag, a rulebook packed with info (including game lore) and even campaign tokens (not this one though).

I've been interested in this since I heard about it.  We're fans of Love Letter and I was hoping this would be as fun to play.  It's not as good with just two players (Love Letter was fine with just 2), but I haven't had a chance to play with more players yet.  We did like the game- finding the Lost Legacy did add a bit more to the game.

Lost Legacy is a spin on the formula popularized by Love Letter. On the surface, it appears to be a much more deduction-heavy game. It actually ends up playing more randomly. While I don't know if the expansion cards can improve this, as is, I prefer Love Letter for a quick, light game with heavy elements of chance and a bit of deduction.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2014)

Fun light game. very Love letter derivative (obviously), but I think the small changes work for the good. I think the game got a bit more strategic as you have tools to bluff a bit better. I really like more this theme. I love that you can now die only by looking the hand of a player :devil:. The investigation phase is very interesting. 

The art is very good. You can explain the game under 3 minutes and it plays very fast. Best with 4 players.

I look forward to try the Flying garden game. Love that both game can be combined. 

Bottom line, I like Lost Legacy: The Starship a bit more than Love Letter, it´s its evolution so I’m rating it accordingly. I’m not sure if I will buy the game but it is a possibility. For now I won’t say no to a game of Lost Legacy.

Current Rating: 6.5

Nowadays, I’m very tired of most (if not all) micro games. The proliferation of Love Letters all over the place doesn’t help my opinion of the games. My desire to play The Starship is very low now, so I’m rating it accordingly. I already sold all my Lost Legacy sets and I’m very happy about that. If I’m going to play boardgames, I prefer meatier games. 

When I Play micro games I feel I’m wasting my precious gaming time. All the games in the Lost Legacy series of games are way too long for what the game offers.

2014-09-17 - I like this game, but right now, I have to say I don't like it quite as much as Love Letter. I feel like it could grow on me, though, as I have only played it a couple of times, and, on paper, the deduction element in this game sounds better than the highest card wins aspect of Love Letter.

2017-11-06 - Yeah, Love Letter is the better game for us.

One of the Lost Legacy series! I think this is Love Letter for people that want to play the game more and the player less. There are certain types of people that just don't "get" Love Letter, and that's the group I'll play this with. Or with larger and less experienced groups. Love Letter shines at 2-4 that know what they're doing, but Lost Legacy is great for everyone!

Horrible... a waste of money. I tried it two times in a 2 players game and it was ridiculous quick. 10 seconds or so... draw 1 card, do 1 action and you win or you lose.

A quick micro game. I have to admit most of these have fallen out of favour with me. This has the same. It was good for a few games but then I felt it had played itself out. It is good at what it does and if you are looking for a quick card game this will definitely hit the spot. There is some fun to be hand in deducing where the starship is and messing around / swopping out with your opponents card in their hand. I know there are other decks you can mix in with this to mix/mash up the game. But ultimately it didn't grab my attention enough to make we want to spend more on it to do this.

In the end I have traded this away and kept love letter.

This is the “gamer” version of Love Letter.  Same concept about drawing a card and making a decision out of two cards, but with a lot more mechanics that thrown in.  The introduction of the “Ruins” and finding the Lost Legacy adds a unique touch.  I will say you should get this if you enjoy Love Letter.

RATING: 10
Almost as simple as Love Letter, but with an investigation phase to determine the winner (assuming it hasn't already been determined by elimination). There is skill in trying to identify and keep track of the Lost Legacy card. The various versions add variety. I've still not explored all this game has to offer even after multiple plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
FUN: comparable to Love Letter and that is one of the best microgames out there. This one is a bit more friendly as elimination is not as common as in Love Letter.

UNIQUE: after Love Letter, this isn't that unique anymore, but there are still only a few micro games that do this much in so few cards.

NEGATIVES: I prefer Love Letter as it is a bit more elegant.

Very similar to Love Letter yet plays out differently.  Trying to track where the "Lost Legacy" card has gone means it has a different feel to Love Letter.  I'm undecided as to which I prefer.  However, I have found the theme of Love Letter works better as a gateway game.

Still a brilliant game with a small footprint that offers a lot for the price.

I would recommend this over Love Letter in less than a heartbeat. Core mechanic is the same (draw one, play one), but it actually feels like there's a game in it, rather than just doing what the cards tell you to. The investigation at the end of a round really gives an amount of strategy to the game, due to both the memorization aspect and the fact that card numbers make a difference.

An OK game, almost like a "Love Letter" variant. Personally prefer: A) simplicity of "Love Letter" or B) different game. This seems a bit too convoluted for what it is, I'm afraid. 
Plus, it's not that good with two sets and more players.

This is the game Love Letter should have been - it has all the same good features, but the decisions are considerably more meaningful due to the increased deduction element in the game.

The same is true of all the Lost Legacy sets - this is the first, and certainly isn't the best, but it's arguably the simplest and still a great game.

Los creadores de "Love Letter" han sacado estos dos nuevos juegos (Existe un tercero pero sólo nos hemos podido hacernos con estos dos). La dinámica es la misma, pero ha mejorado enormemente el arte y muchísimo la interacción de los personajes debido a las cartas. Además ambos juegos pueden mezclarse para aumentar el número máximo de jugadores de 4 a 8. Los que queden vivos al final deben saber donde se encuentra la carta número 5 "Lost Legacy". Quien la consiga gana la partida.

31-08-2014. Rated after 10 plays. Difficult version of love letter. Aim here is to discover the spaceship. The spaceship acn be located in the hands of your opponents or in the ruins, a stack of cards that is secret. 

The game breaks down into two parts. In the first part, you play cards to eliminate opponents (like love letter) and to exchange hands/cards with opponents or with the ruins so you hopefully know where the ship is. All cards have a value. The lower, the first they are in the second round of the game. During the second round, the number of the card in your hand is called and you get to guess who of which card in the ruins is the space-ship. If you are correct, you win, of no one is correct everybody lose.

Fun. It starts as a more chaotic version of love letter, but after a few game you start seeing patterns and tactics.  I am not sure if I like this game better than love letter, but both are fun. I think I like the simplicity of love letter better, but this is a fun change.

I enjoyed this game. It's not quite as fun as Love Letter, but it's a good time, with many similar mechanics to Love Letter.
If your Love Letter needs a break, I'd say pick this up to switch things up a little bit. Otherwise, stick to LL until you're covered in little red cubes!

Maybe this game is too micro for it's own good.   It felt like if there were bad draws there was almost no way to get information, and whoever ended the game with the luck to draw a 2,3,or 4 had a big advantage.  Not a big fan of this one.

Pleasantly surprised both at the vibe of the game and how similar mechanical approach is used on a totally different core of the game. This game kinda feels more of a microgame than LL, probably as it's a bit more gamey (not as cheerfully chaotic), yet even more about bluffing and figuring out what's going on. I also appreciate how more is going on in 1 round and that it's only one round. AEG artwork is better than on their LL, but not something that would attract me as such. Not sure I need to own these, but I'd like to try more decks.

Expansions: Flying Gardens, Second Chronicle, Third Chronicle

Neat little successor to Love Letter. Doesn't work well with 2 players, being best with 4-6, as the exciting part here is the investigation round which is non-existent at lower player counts due to elimination. I like that there's multiple sets with crossover possibility, should be great going forwards.

RATING: 6
1 play, 3er

This is similar to but different than Love Letter. And not as good, I think. On the first play, at least, it felt very random: mostly just a guessing game with little actual deduction. Maybe that's just because of our unfamiliarity with the cards. I will perhaps need to try it with 4 -- hopefully it's better?

You go through the 16 card deck just once. There are multiples of some cards, singles of others -- including the Lost Legacy (5). The goal is to find this missing card. Shuffle the deck, put one face down in the Ruins, and deal each player a card. On your turn, draw a card, then play a card to your discard pile and do what it says (e.g., look at a card, trade card, eliminate a player, etc.). If all but one player is eliminated, that player wins. If more than one player remains in the game when the deck is empty, there is a final round where players take their turn in an order dictated by the card currently in their hands: on your turn, reveal a card (your own, someone else's, or one in the Ruins) -- if it's the Lost Legacy, you win! If no one finds the legacy, everyone loses.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Touted as the sequel to Love Letter, this game plays incredibly similar.  There is a small deck of cards and each turn a player draws one and plays one of the two cards in their hand.  The difference being that there is a little bit less elimination in this game and instead of outright comparing numbers for victory at the end (if all but one player haven't been eliminated) you, in numerical order of the cards, have to identify the location of the goal card.  The cards in this game instead of giving you means to eliminate players (although some do that as well) involve a lot more searching and rearranging of the cards making it a bit of a shell game where the goal card is, if you even see it at all.

I like this game, it really is just like Love Letter with a twist but I personally think I would still always rather play Love Letter.  Love Letter has a kind of elegance and charm that I can't really explain that makes me still like playing even after dozens of games.  Honestly, this game felt a little bit rough around the edges whereas Love Letter plays smooth as whipped butter.

I also have no idea why AEG took the original microgame and is releasing 3 different editions of it.  Seems a bit much to me.

Take Love Letter and change the focus from holding the highest card at the end to trying to know where a certain card is and you have Lost Legacy. This is an AEG reskin of the 'basic' deck included in the Japanese version.

Something to watch with the AEG version is they tried to simplify the rules by changing some timing issues. Fortunately, the change has no noticable effect on this deck (but it can with some of the other decks).

My gaming group is a big fan of Love Letter so this seemed like a good choice to ramp up the mechanics and the strategy. This set wasn't actually the big step up in mechanics that I was expecting which was slightly disappointing, but having looked at the other sets in the series they add a lot more interactions and this set is a good starting place for the series for sure, and you can combine sets too so its worth having.

The best so far in the category of micro games and rated according to that.

-Combined with Lost Legacy: Flying Garden this game became very interesting. Played with 6 players and we actually did a few "maneuvers" which is uncommon in microgames. However, the downtime with 6 players becomes too much for a microgame, so I might rather split into 2 games than play 6 player again even if there is some charm in the 6p game.

This is just Love Letter with a slightly tweaked end game that keeps things exciting for everyone at the table, since the highest card doesn't necessarily win. This makes the game even more deduction oriented, rather than player elimination oriented, as Love Letter often devolves into. In a neat twist, there are multiple entries into this series with completely different card sets, which allows you to mix and match cards to make every session completely unique.

The draw-one-play-one card mechanic works reasonably well, but the game doesn't seem to scale very well; it needs 4 players to gel. A single play to decide the winner also increases the luck factor in the game. Lastly, the theme feels a tad pasted on.

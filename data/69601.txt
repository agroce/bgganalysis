RATING: 10
Currently one of my favourites, the most interesting mechanic of variable share rounds puts a whole different spin on who to invest in as it's not just how much they will pay out but when. The variable president certificate, grand scale of the map, lots of companies, foreign investors, communist take over and bonus dividends linked to the stock market gel together very well and I am keen to investigate the system more.

One of the few 18xx I don't mind playing without the aid of a computer. It is fairly long though, therefor you should really prepare your fellow gamers for quite an intense and very long session.

December 2010, After one play with 4: good, long, full of strange rules.  This is a considerable divergence from 'standard' 18xx, but many of the same features are retained.  Some of the key differences include companies floating early (as little as 20% in the early game), no 60% ownership limit, president's certificates can be 20/30/40%, and there's a bonus added to the value of a company's runs if it makes it two or more spaces to the right on the stock chart.  It's also not a short game: there are 14 companies and a lot of trains.

The game seems to first trick you into opening too many companies, at which point the problem is how to get trains for them all.  After only one play, I'd guess that the path to victory involves owning a lot (i.e. 80% or more) of one or two companies that you drive into the high bonus values.  If you have to ruin a company or two to get the money, then so be it -- if you open early you only need to waste a single 20% share on the company that withholds to get the money to buy trains for the others.

I'm not sure about the history though: the game runs from 1880 to 2038, judging by the years written on the trains, but it doesn't necessarily feel like railroading in China.  The most salient piece of history included is the communist takeover (from the 4 to 6 trains) where share prices don't move for any reason.  In practice, this seems to involve free money as there's not as much cost to having companies withhold, but it does seem a little odd that the communists are good for the owners of railroad companies).  We also weren't sure about the logos or the names for the railroads: unless we're mistaken many of the logos are actually the crests of Japanese clans.  The train pictures are also ahistorical.  This is probably due to a lack of good English/German sources, but it was a bit disappointing.

Another interesting entry in the 18xx range. Lots of new and interesting variations on the standard take, and I get the feeling that in our first play we barely managed to understand how the whole thing works.

Still, there were a few things that for now prevent this game from being among my top 18xx: it was very procedural, with lots of companies and long runs on a big map making income calculations lengthy, leading to a rather long game. Also, I got the feeling that the map status was unpredictable, with the sheer number of companies and locations making it hard to properly plan the long term development of a company. And I felt that the operating order scheme and OR/SR sequence, while certainly novel, didn't work as well as the standard one, and it was too easy to be surprised by developments. Finally, the market was fairly static, with the possiblity of owning 100% of a company coupled with easy extra capitalization from foreign investors and the no market penalty withold period, making for a low risk, no dump approach. 

I think a lot of this can be simply put down to the first time with a more complex game, but I can't help the feeling that some of it is intrinsic to the design. Overall, my opinion for now is that this is a game of knowing when and where to start companies, and then managing them well (which is made harder by the initially open ended nature of the map), rather than knowing when and where to invest.

So, for now, it's a good alternative to the more played games, but, mostly because of play time, something that will not be played too often.

UPDATE [1.13.18] The gem is back in my 18xx collection.  Acquired in a trade for 18Dixie (MS/GA)

[9.10.17] - I had a chance to play this game again F2F (only other plays were online), and it has completely changed my opinion of this game.  I currently have it rated as a 6, but it is easily in the running for one of my top 5 favorite 18xx titles (other contenders being 1817, 1822, 1862/EA, 18OE).

My online experience saw other opponents buy and selling all other player's stocks just to keep stock prices low.  I found this incredibly annoying as it was done just to reduce stock value.

Also, I think I misunderstood how unnecessary it was to have a southern company connect to Beijing or be connected to the North.

The opening auction is unique and clever.  8 privates (P0 through P7).  The person with the least amount of money left gets to choose the first of several foreign investor locations (similar to minor companies in other 18xx titles).  The foreign investors operate in numerical order even if they are chosen out of numerical order.

When companies start, the president share density is variable: 20, 30 or 40%  However, the higher the density share, the company receives fewer phases in which it can build/lay track.  This is a great decision to have to make right away when you're floating your company.  As soon as your companies building permit expires, then your company can operate as normal, and even lay station tokens, but it ceases to build track.

The way in which stock rounds are triggered is one of the best mechanisms I've played in any 18xx title.  The SR is triggered if every company operates and no company elects to purchase a new train from the bank.  When that happens, ALL remaining trains of a certain type are removed from the game and the next trains are up.  This can really cause the train rush to occur at a different and unexpected rate. 

Great game.  Far superior to 18Dixie, which is what I sold 1880 for.

[12.17.15] - The SR's that are determined by the the sale or lack of train sales is the most unique aspect of this game.  I'm not a fan of the map.  The northern and southern part of the board seem extremely disconnected almost as if players are playing on two completely separate maps, but are still interacting with each other in the same game.  3rd (bottom) tier 18xx for me.  Sold for $100 to a local 18xx group member.  Hoping to use money to get a copy of 18Dixie.

[10.15.15] - Rating decrease of .2.  The SR's feel formulaic for me (main objective keep other companies stocks out of the higher bonus paying zones of the stock market).  I'd rather spend my hours playing a different 18xx game.

[6.18.14] - PBeM game still in session.  OR5.  Rating downgrade from 9.9 to 9.6 only because I played 18OE, and though there are mechanics in 1880 I enjoy more than any other 18xx game I've ever played (i.e. triggering of SR by the sale or non-sale of trains) the epic feel of OE and all of the different companies causes OE to just barely beat out 80 - barely.

Impressive new version. Some radical innovations to the system (though still quite solidly a 1830-branch game). The dynamic train roster and SR-OR mechanism is great, and so is the building permit limitations. Great production values to what is probably one of the most replayable 18xx versions out there.

After 4 plays, this game has grown on me.  The way ORs/SRs train rusting works is enough to make me want to play this one on occasion.  Add in the need to rush to get RRs moving forward before the Revolution strikes, the potential extra tile lays and treasury cash with the foreign investors, the variable tile lay times, the variable president certs, and the locked down stock market and it's a very unique game.  While it's not my favorite (it is Amanda's favorite), I agree it's a good game.

There's a lot of innovative or at least fresh-feeling stuff going on with this 18xx title to make it unique and attractive to play. It tends to overstay its welcome just a bit, or at least seems to take longer than it ought to to play.

I'd love to play more often, but its been hard to get on the table. I think I'm more enthusiastic about it than a couple of my local gaming buddies.

Double-O Games's latest effort is much more straightforward than their usual fare, without multiple train and company types. Instead what we have resembles 1856 with its large board and large number of similar companies. The McGuffin is the variable stock round, which is original, although there's enough multiplayer chaos in its timing to make it hard to see it as a game controlling mechanism. Beyond that this is a by-the-numbers big board 18xx with the emphasis on route building and tokening. Solid, but below the buy threshold for me.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

After two games, I've decided this isn't the game for me.  

There are a lot of innovations in this game, and I admire the designers ingenuity on the changes they have wrought.  But the mechanisms don't really make much sense to me.  The timing of the stock rounds seems artificial.  The rules around the Cultural Revolution force in-game behavior that I dislike.  The map is huge, and feels loose with fewer players.  And the duration, which with more plays might eventually reduce, seems too long.  I sold my copy.

18XX variant set in China.  They game has variable rules to float a company.  Early companies can be floated for 20% and they half capitalize.  There is also a concept of a foreign investor which collects money and you can take the money at 20% or roll all money into your starting company.  After the first 4 train is bought, the communists take over and the market freezes.  Often it is a good idea to retain under these conditions to setup for the 6 trains and the re-opening of the market.  Game ends when the first train is bought.  Market rounds only occur when all trains of one type are bought, or if no company buys a train after each has operated.  

In general, I like the game and it is an interesting variant, but it is not my favorite.  Runs a little long for what it is.

[b][thing=69601][/thing][/b] is the first Double-O game I've played (excluding the Euro [b][thing=144733][/thing][/b] by the same designers).  A couple things about this one which makes it unique from other [b][family=19][/family][/b]: there are no set number of operating rounds (ORs) before a share round (SRs).  A SR happens immediately upon the purchase of the last train of a type from the bank.  This makes planning for a SR more difficult than our standard [b][family=19][/family][/b] and a couple times it caught me with no cash on hand.  The game has a two step process for capitalizing companies - when a company floats, it only gets 50% of it's operating capital.  It gets the other 50% when the director owns 50% of the shares.  The last major difference is that companies each get a build permit which allows them to build track during certain "ages" in the game.  There are four ages and at best you can only build in three of them.  Reading the rules, it seemed more than a little intimidating, but it turned out not to be all that bad at all and I'd happily play it again.

Heavyish 18xx. Rulebook left out a couple of critical clarifications (for example initial p6 auction of company; does it apply for chosen foreign investor). 

Some nice ideas (foreign investors, ruthless par value turnorder system) but as a whole.... a bit too much everything (trains, companies, new tweaked rules to 18xx gameframe...)

Not my favourite 18xx but 18xx anyway.

Update 08/2011: Rating upped to '9'. it appears that playing a game correctly improves gaming experience...

I like this game not only because it has an interesting map but also because it has  different aspects that the other 18xx do not have.  There is the foreign investor that will build track and eventually link up with the first company a player started.  There is also the communist period of the game where the stock value will not change even if the company decides to withhold the dividends.  There is not a fixed number of operating rounds between stock rounds.  The next stock round is determined by how long it has been since a company bought a train.

RATING: 9.7
My group has been meeting monthly for 8+ hour games sessions for years, tending to play the same game for 2-3 sessions in a row, then moving on.  18xx has been at our table now for 20 months in a row, and I expect it will be for many more months to come. These games are insanely addictive.  

18xx in general offers a fantastic amount of decision space for a relatively simple rule set.  It offers a healthy dose of screwage ability, while not succumbing to the gang-up potential present in most multi-player games.  The physical aspects of track laying and station placement, coupled with plethora of financial manipulations/decisions in the game, offers the largest variety of meaningful decisions I've ever seen in any game.  

1880 offers a large playing area, and a layout that guarantees track placement will not tend to play out the same.  The stock market is active in this game, but not as much so as say in 1830.  That is ok though, as there are many other aspects of the game to concern one's self with.  I really like the variable president's share and associated decisions; as well as the way stock rounds are triggered - it really puts a whole new and interesting twist on the game.  1880 seems to provide an even blend of track building/token placement, and financial considerations.  It is a bit too long though for a single session, otherwise it't be a 10.  

Edit: Me and my group have, after much play testing over ~6 months, created a short variant for 1880.  It has turned out remarkably well, and shaves a solid 2 hours off the game while still keeping all the goodness that makes 1880 so great.

Playtime: ~240-360 minutes

Comment: Kind of long, although with 4 players that knew the game, we finished in 3 1/2 to 4 hours. The components are mostly great and the game has quite enough variables to keep it fresh for a while. I could see some of the plays getting a bit samey. The communist phase is great, the player initiated stock rounds is fun and having a permanent turn order helps to speed up some aspects of the game.

[b]Update:[/b] I do think there might be a few too many of each train and a nice train rush would probably shave off a solid hour of the game. Sometimes the communist phase lasts a bit too long. I also do think this game might improve if there actually was a bank limit of say 15k. We finished our 4 player game with almost 28k at the end. Holy crap that's a lot of money floating about. 

The game is fantastic, albeit a little long. One of my favorites, but I wonder if it could be shortened 30-60 minutes to a much more reasonable time and still keep a relatively grand scale about it.

Optimal Player Count: Plays better with higher player counts due to the size of the map. I like it with 5+, but 4 is just fine. 7 [i]might[/i] be pushing it, but I don't know.

One solid play by email experience, or is it really 100 plays? (each time I made a move I plotted to see the downstream effects). This game is a long one, but a good one. It had some interesting takes on the operating rounds by adding a "state controlled" round where there were game changing rules added. 1880 is a long game and not for the faint of heart. There is a definite slant towards running good companies and laying good track work vs. stock market shenanigans.

Brutal, brutal game. It's as nice a game as it gets from the double-o team; complex mechanism, not so much chrome, less gimmicks, and speed up tools.

--Jun2014-- Fascinatingly non-standard interleaving of stock and operating rounds make this an interesting exercise in prediction and incentives.  The trains are interestingly lumpy (the "plus" versions, at least in this all-novice table seemed very strong compared to the ordinary-ish trains that came before and after); it seems necessary to be able to predict (or at least manipulate) the way the trains fall out:  and that will require some practice.  Yet given the length, it's not one I'll be able often to get to the table.  I suspect I'm stuck in that enjoying-but-having-no-expertise zone for a while.

Very open board with lots of companies.  I've seen almost every company started early in the game with good success, although there are a few which are pretty terrible.  The unique train export mechanism and fixed operating order based on par value instead of current share price is a nice addition to the 18XX system.

This is a very solid game with enough variation away from the standard 18XX rules to make this one of my top recommendations for those trying to build up an 18XX collection.

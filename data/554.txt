RATING: 8
This is quickly becoming one of my favorite games.  The play feels fast with 2, because there is always more you want to do, and there is just the right amount of confrontation for me.

Something about the game reminds me of Tigris and Euphrates, except less aggressive and thematically more integrated and immersive. I can't wrap my head around T&E, but La Citta's play is intuitive and absorbing.

Superb game of city building and ever increasing tense conflict. Works excellently with two and is a breath of fresh air because (ironically) it's older and is therefore not overpowered by the influence of PR and Caylus as so many other games are.

RATING: 6
A civilization tile-laying game.

The initial setup of the game is similar to Settlers of Catan in that you want to make your initial placements near the best resources.  Then the gameplay involves playing actions (3 of which are "free") through card play.  Your goal is to build up large, strong cities, that you can still maintain well enough to feed your people, and keep them happy.  To do this, you need to have enough food, the right type of buildings, and of course you need enough money to continue to maintain everything.

There are many opportunities to both gain and lose people from competitors cities, and having people is where most of the points come from, and a loss at the right time and/or part of your city can be devastating.  

This is a quality design, and it is very strategic, but it has two significant components to the game (purchased actions, and the voice of the people) that are random card-draws, which can be a bit unnerving for such a long strategy game.  What I found interesting is that I was losing the game for the first 5 rounds, and ended up winning in the 6th and final round.  Even with that, it felt like a game I respected rather than enjoyed playing, but this may have been due to the extremely long length of the game.

RATING: 7
As a civ style game, it has several true Euro mechanics in the politics cards and wonderfully original methods for growing cities - the voice of the people is particularly engaging and original. Good components combined with nicely arranged, excruciating turn decisions make this game tense. Other players blundered into poor city starting positions, leaving them crushed and out of the end game running. But still, our game ended with a tie breaker by 2 gold pieces! The take back from all of this is the length of play and the brutality vs. new players.

I like this, but it didn't really grab me the first time through, maybe because I did rather poorly.  Great mechanics and very balanced gameplay.  Too often though, the 7 political cards have no buildings available, which leaves rather poor choices.  Will reaccess after another play or two.

City building/resource management game with nice bits. Great game with lots of tough decisions on every turn. Good opportunities for screwage and direct confrontation as you battle over citizens.  Great game, but I would rate it higher if there were a better way to track your food and citizens. Also a simple solution needs to be found for the stale political card issue although this is fairly minor.

Hopefully by the end of the summer I can get at least one play of this in... maybe I can convince my girlfriend to give it a go two player.

RATING: 8
A good game that isn't quite what it appears to be. It seems to be all about city building... and it is, but not like other city building games. 

There are no resources to produce other than food and money. It's ultimately all about the *influence* of your cities. The goal is to attract and KEEP the biggest population--because how you build your cities will eventually set you up to either steal or lose citizens to neighboring cities. It mostly boils down to a war of tactically oriented influence and supply chains. 

Beyond that, I like the way actions work and the 'voice of the people' creates a neat dynamic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite good! Very fun. I added a bunch of black, blue, yellow, and white 30 sided dice so that metrics can be tracked for each city on the field (counting and recounting everything was a negative strike against it in the reviews I read), which adds a couple pounds to the box.

It nicely balances quality of options with simplicity of teaching the rules. Given that both I and my brother liked it, I think that it would go over well with almost anyone.

Well thought out game, easy to pick up, and probably deserves a better rating. Played twice, and havn't felt cheated by any of the rules (which makes a change). Having checked out what other people thought of the game, it's no surprise to see that while there are only a few 10's, there are a large number of 9's & 8's. This is indicative of a game with a healthy following, and quite rightly so.

RATING: 7
I find La Citta oddly reminiscent of Age of Steam.  There is the same tension between the growth necessary for victory and outstripping the resources to support it. The central mechanic in La Citta is emigration from your neighbour's dusty town to your gleaming city state.  Unfortunately, new citizens are also new mouths to feed and the penalties for letting people starve are suitably severe. Also like Age of Steam, La Citta is absolutely unforgiving; an early mistake can lose you the game.  Oh and there's no gradual build up in the contest, both games are a bare knuckle fight from the very start.

It is true that La Citta has a significant number of random or incalculable elements.  Chief among the latter is the inability to predict how many citizens your city will gain or lose this year with any precision.  The political cards also seem poorly balanced; the master builder is almost always taken as soon as he appears, rich harvests tend to just clutter up the display. 

Artwork and production quality are both very good.  The available English translation of the rules is serviceable but not an easy read.

A lity civilization game or should I say city building game? Rules are simple but the game feels outdated. Maybe its the dull graphics. I dont know. 
So players are building cities on the board. each city has their own citizens but they are willing to move if they find a more advanced city next to them. This mechanic provides enough interaction between players. You also have to feed your citizens or else they die.

What a long and annoying game!  This game has many design problems that should have been ironed out in play testing.  Does not deserve its relatively high BGG rating, though I suppose it is appealing to some as a hunger/civ game with (who really cares!) arches. As another gamer said about La Citta...'Oh, that's the runaway leader, I lost in the first 10 minutes game!' You would have to tie me up to make me to play this game again.

Frustrating and fiddly.  The "Voice of the people" mechanic is a good idea, used in the wrong game in the wrong way.  It makes the game annoyingly random: each "year" takes 20 minutes of gameplay, then whether it was a success or a failure comes down to the flip of a card.  The bizarre rule that action cards no-one wants clog up the table for the entire rest of the game means a poor choice of useful action cards, increasing randomness.
Disappointing since there are some good elements here (for example, the layout of the board is ingeniously designed and perfectly suited to its intention.)

Rating based on just one play.  

I have to admit that I enjoyed playing this, but I think there are a lot of problems.  It kept me engaged as I tried to figure out what to do with my five actions, balancing food, gold production, city expansion, and competition with neighboring cities.  There were usually many things that needed to be done, and I needed to prioritize based on what I thought my neighbors would do.

But those elements can be found in better games.

1. I found myself constantly counting up my people to make sure I had enough food -- and not only the people I had, but my speculated population changes as well.  It's very necessary but tedious.

2. Seven special cards are always present, and you have to spend at least two actions a turn on them.  The problem is that they come up randomly, and bad cards don't get cleared out.  So we were often stuck with poor options unless the person before you goes and a new card comes up.

3. The central mechanic which dictates how people move from city to city is pretty random as well.  You can try to count cards or use an action to peek at what's coming, but mostly it's just random.

In the end I realized a few efficiency mistakes I made, but other than that the game didn't leave me with much to think about.

RATING: 6
Recently revisited with 3P.  Past plays with 2P have yielded runaway leaders, and I'm still inclined to think that the game lends itself to that.  Hard to imagine playing with more than 3P because of game length, which didn't seem worth it for the game experience with that count.  Found the rules revisit relatively simple and umambiguous, if repetitive.  Love the bits.  Like the small mix of hidden, accessible information.  The action cards can pile up, especially at the game end (many seem to house rule it).  Found it a large advantage to be able to bleed out abandoned cities turn after turn, with the issue being that there's little to no incentive for an owner to combat it once it's started.  Although turns can be planned, the potential downtime between them really leads me to think this would be better as a PBW game.  Maybe SpielByWeb will really finish it, one day.

An excellent building game.  Initial placement is very tricky and new players should follow the suggested setup to avoid some severe troubles.  Well balanced and playable.  The biggest drawback is the game length which is just a smidge longer than one expects.  This tends to prevent the game from hitting the table as often as it should.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

Too vicious in 2-player, while the board is very crowded with more. Mistakes are very costly, and your turn can be determined a lot (I'm starting to think "too much") due to which political card became available in the previous turn.

Each turn was so stressful, each turn you feel like there is not enough actions. Each turn you want to do more.

My favourite city-building game where you need to control resources (especially food) and make sure that your citizens are well-supplied with art, hospitals and schools or else they well travel to a neighbouring city.

Long term planning needs to  be approached carefully or your expansion will suddenly hit a brick wall.  There are also countless opportunities to screw your opponents plans.

Only drawback is the countless hexagons representing improvements are double-sided demanding too much game time for sorting and searching.

Fun epic feeling game with four players, my first play was at a convention, so it was board game overload, and I LOVED it, it stood out and I played a fair amount of titles, all of which like this one, I have not played before, so I have to say this is a superior experience.

For now it and Roads and Boats are virtually tied for Second best in show for me personally, however I do think this one will hit the table more often than that one, and its available a lot more readily for now, so it gets the number two nod. As the days since the con have moved on I think of this one often and am fairly certain it will see the table from time to time with just my wife and I, and I truly believe it will stand out when the gang comes over.

Im a bit undecided about this one. First game (three players) was somewhat confusing. Having a 2 month baby to take care of at the same time as playing probably did not help.

Medium euro, at the heart if which is a mechanism for building your cities and stealing people (=points) from cities nearby. The requirement to feed all the people you have (or face a harsh punisment) and build your cities functionally contends nicely against the requirement to outdo your fellow cities in the 3 resources (or the one which will be popular this turn) to ensure you steal people from them and not the other way round. A solid game.

RATING: 6
La Città is your typically serious, unforgiving, thinking-heavy eurogame where mirth is forbidden, laughs are uncommon and your only aim is to limit the damage you take.

Anyhow, it has two features I like: it employs nice miniatures instead of the usual wooden cubes and, unlike most such games, it even allows and fosters direct confrontation among players, although by bloodless and sly means only, which turns into a double-edged weapon, since you can both attract citizens from an opponent’s town this turn and then lose them to him the next turn.

Although it’s quite long, often clueless and definitely boring, all in all I found La Città slightly enjoyable.

[bought German version punched but not played from a local guy I traded with]

I really like this game, just like I thought I would. The five actions per turn are just enough to make me feel like I'm accomplishing something, but still few enough to make me feel like I need more. The decisions are tough, and it's cool to see stuff spreading all over the board. I agreed that the UI of the game isn't great--it's hard to tell what's what and to count up all your people and resources and distinguish between the buildings and castles, etc., but I used hholzgrafe's excellent player aids, and it's certainly not enough to discourage me from playing this game again. 

I wasn't sure I'd want a "civ lite" game after I fell in love with and bought Through the Ages, but it's so completely different from that game that I needn't have worried. Big thumbs up on this one.

Have only played it 2-player, and I can see that there might be a runaway leader problem, but maybe not. It was a learning game for both of us. I'll need to play it again before I can tell if it's indicative of the game or if it was just a fluke. I think that up to four players it would be fine, but that the board would be too tight for my liking with five players. Maybe not. I wouldn't be averse to trying it.

UPDATE:
Have played it with 3 and 4 players now. It's great with any number so far. The board scales well. The only thing they don't scale is the number of building tiles, which can probably run out with 5 players and would add a whole new factor to the game. I've played three times in a week or so, and I still want to play it again soon. Great game!

The turns go pretty fast, because you have only so many choices, so there's not a lot of downtime.

Magnificent. The French Tilsit edition. An Excellent light game of growth and city development, not quite Civ-lite but close, and it plays very well as a 2-player game, which is rare for these types of games. The board layout creates interesting interactions and it heats up as the game goes along. UPDATE:There aren't a lot of really fun Civ-oriented building games that are good with 2 or 3, but this is one. Two of my gaming friends met at my house and we played a three player game and they both say it reminded them very much of Civ 2 or 3 the computer game. Scores were very close at the end; I won with 29 and they tied with 23. This goes to a 10 for me.

Interesting game of territory control.  Hard for the losing player(s) to "catch up".  Large amount of luck in card draws.  Moderate learning curve for building tile placement and for the timing of building purchases (some buildings are required for growth beyond population level 5 & 10).  Note: you can steal citizens from your own cities and kill the city if it reaches 0 citizens; From experience, I can say that this is a bad idea.

This game has a very good designed board, the more players, the more board is used. It also looks very elegant. The game keeps every player captivated and you really get the sense of trying to make your city stat(es) bigger. The more the games progress, the more players are focussed on stealing inhabitants from other players, by luring them with better facilities. This however depends on luck, which service is popular at the end of a round (based on card draw, 2 out of 4).

I like the fact that the box offers a spot to organise the bits and pieces. The game uses a bunch of miniature figures, which are a bit fiddly to use because they are tiny.

An empire building game - sort of. Forget the theme, it is basically irrelevant to the game. You are tasked with developing the two cities you start with so as to maximize their value and to have the largest population by the game end. Depending on how many players you have, the possibility of establishing up to two more cities may be feasible.

Limited action game regulated by a card draft and augmented by three cards each player has to use each turn. Players may draw population from opponent's cities depending on the type of infrastructure you have and the results of another separate card draw.

A fair amount of luck is generated by the card distribution and while there is ample room for strategy and tactics, one is always having to adjust to the changing situation created by the card flow. If you can live with that, the game works quite well and provides an interesting challenge. Four players can finish a game in a couple of hours.

Provisional rating, might alter with more plays. Definitely better with the political card variant where the political cards are cycled very regularly, there's a trend that the small cities stay small (if they're near a big city which keeps draining their population) - but that's okay if you focus on the victory conditions, having a big city in the end game is dangerous if you suffer starvation. Much prefer the randomised setup gives a different challenge each game.

This is something of an economic engine game, with limited actions, and a direct competition mechanism whereby you are able to steal other player's citizens - this is very significant, since you must have a citizen for each tile in each of your cities, so stealing citizens reduces their ability to grow, or even causes some destruction of the city.  

The heart of the game is the Political round, where you choose 5 actions in five rounds.  You have 3 default actions, and the others come from 7 cards laid out on a display.  The actions available dictate what you can do.  Most of them allow you to do more if you pay for it, so gold becomes useful for accessing better actions.  

There is a food mechanic as well where you must produce as much food as you have citizens at the end of the round, with the penalty for failing being harsh enough that it is not a viable strategy to fail.  

Overall, the main goal of the game is to steal everyone else's citizens.  Citizens are the main source of victory points at the end.  You also get some from cities, but you'll get those if you've been doing what it takes to steal citizens.  The catch is that cities require a lot of "support" buildings in order to have just a few buildings that help you steal citizens.  So you spend most of your actions building infrastructure.  The rules are also structured such that it is quite likely that once you start having citizens stolen from one city, you might as well give up on it, and focus elsewhere.  It is not always true that you will not be able to defend, but it is true often enough to be frustrating.  And even if a successful defense is possible, it may not be a wise use of your limited resources.  

My first play was a 3 player, and, despite limited competition, it got a very poor response from the other 2 players.  I was solidly neutral on it.  I think that with enthusiastic veterans, there is probably a very tight game of maneuvering and backstabbing in here.  With anyone else, this is probably not worth playing.  It's just too tight, too unforgiving, and too opaque a game to be good on the first play, and I just don't play enough to be willing to invest several 2 hour sessions not having fun so that I can eventually enjoy it.

Overall, I will keep it for now and try to play one more time, but I don't see it remaining in my collection long term.

La citta es un juego de desarrollo de ciudades. El desarrollo se lleva a cabo mediante la construcción de diferentes tipos de edificios que aumentan el atractivo de la ciudad en tres aspectos: Salubridad, conocimiento y estética. En cada turno, está representada la voz del pueblo que determina cual de esos aspectos va a ser más valorado por los habitantes de las ciudades... y según consigas ciudades más adecuadas, provocaras movimientos migratorios de las ciudades vecinas hacia las tuyas. Pero ojo, las ciudades tienen que estar preparadas parael aumento de población y a toda esa gente hay que darle de comer. El objetivo es conseguir mayor población y ciudades con los tres atractivos. Perder gente por falta de comida en el ultimo turno te puede penalizar. 
Es un juego no demasiado complicado, pero bastante cerebral. El tablero se queda pequeño rapidamente y las decisiones hay que pensarlas bien. 

Todo un descubrimiento. Recomendable sin lugar a dudas.

The game combines building up your "own" little realm and managing resources with rather direct player interaction (that can be used aggressively without being an attack).
The game shows its age a little bit in the design, as the board gets rather busy in the later rounds and it is a PITA to count and recount your citizens several times each round (OK, could be my lack of short-time memory ;-))
Scales very well from 2-5 due to variable board size, although the 5 player can get a little crowded and takes a bit too ong for my taste.

La Citta with two is not good.  This is one of those games where one misstep (or not going first on a turn) early on basically decides the game, with very little ability to muster a comeback.

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting, almost abstract city-builder that pushes you to grow but punishes you severely if you overextend yourself. Early in the game, you'll be desperate for water and money so you can expand your population/city with fountains/buildings, but later on, food will be your primary concern. Failure to feed your population can be devastating, and sometimes unintentional if you happen to win a couple of city challenges and suddenly find yourself short of food during scoring. 

As a result, the whole game becomes a delicate balancing act between wanting to shoot ahead in one area, only to discover it will punish you in another. I love the card market, which definitely changes your strategy when a good card comes up. Overall, it's a really neat design, and feels surprisingly fresh for such an old game.

I like the mechanics, but the game is quite dry.  Luck of the draw for the politics cards is irritating.  It can be incredibly difficult to save a city once it starts getting the life sucked out of it by its neighbors (read: "rich get richer") which is unsatisfying.  Plus the game takes WAY too long with 4 or 5 players (3-4 hours!).  I'll have to get in a 2 or 3 player game to see how it goes since the game scales linearly with the number of players, but right now I'm not impressed.

One of my favorite moderate-to-heavies.  Game has depth, but the rules flow in such a way that the game plays intuitively.  Gamers pick this up quickly, and I would hazard a guess that the rules are simple enough to maybe use la Citta' as a gateway game.  The strategy, however, gives the game its depth, and newbies may not fare all that well.  I am extremely lucky to have found this game.

I recently moved this rating higher when I realized I obsess about this game.

UPDATE 2010:  Only play this on occasion any more.  Still love it when it is played, but for simplicity's sake, I choose other games very often.  Just a touch too heavy for a quick and easy romp.

RATING: 8
A nice, clever game of city-building (sort of). Although the play of the game is strictly I go-you go, it moves along pretty briskly for the most part as there are limited choices each turn and a fair number of moves will be "forced" (you have to build farms, quarries, etc). This is OK, as what you do with the left-overs is important and there is enough flexibility in timing of the stuff you have to do with respect to the stuff you want to do (you're going to have to build a farm, but you can put it off if something else good is available, or do it now and hope something better comes up).

Still, avoid with the AP types, there is significant potential for lock-up here. Also, it bears mentioning that the luck in the game is not trivial. The Voice of the People can be harsh. But one of the cool things about La Citta is that it *is* a harsh game, and keeping your people fed and happy is not easy, and if you blow it your cities can hemorrhage people and die.  This is kind of a nice break from the usual forgiving German games, and it's not over-done - the game is neither long nor harsh enough to have people kicked to the curb for too long.

Note on the 2007 reprint: I'm not totally enamored of the new language-independent cards; the old ones were clearer.

Unless you really become La Citta sharks, stick with the "beginner" setup. Unbalanced setups can lead to an uninteresting game, even more so than Settlers, and what makes a good setup is tricky. I've played this a fair amount and still always found the best games use the standard setups.

Wow, I love this game.  The rules are relatively simple - there are only a few actions you are capable of on your turn.  It's how these actions so intricately influence the game in uncountable and often unpredictable ways that make it shine.  I really love this game.

RATING: 7
Very interesting and fun!  Plan out your city to attract the most people, but not so many that you won't be able to feed them all!

The games are always very tight, with little room for error.  Lots of things to keep your eye on, and the unpredictability of what the people want (their movement is determined by a face-down set of cards that you might be able to peek at a portion of if you're lucky) keeps the game tense.

Played it once to date with four players. Hope to get a second playing very soon. 

As opposed to Attika and a number of other games, the city building theme actually is both strong and well done.

The are a number of interesting building strategies and I find attaining the golden middle of controlled growth as opposed to demographic decline or overpopulation most interesting.

So, there is a lot to like. However, a bit of accounting and the danger of analysis paralysis may be offputting for some. The latter phenomenon really depends with whom you play. With slow players, there'll be too much downtime and the game longer than it ought to. We had a bit of that, but then most of us were unfamiliar with the game, so I hope next time we'll play, we'll do so at a brisker pace.

As for the raised criticism of runaway victories, well, I dare say in such a case the rest of the board simply aren't doing their job. We had a photo-finish and I believe with competent players games should be close and tense until the end.

Yes, it's long. Yes, it's a bit fiddly. But there is SO much going on, and SO much to agonize over, and so little time to do it, it just begs to be put back on the table for just one more try. One of my first, and still one of my faves. (Great with 2, to boot!)

RATING: 9
The theme of keeping your people fed and happy else you lose them (death or migration to better cities) is terrific. Has both a lot of player interaction/screwage and fighting against the game system, which is a pretty rare combo. I understand the complaint about the action cards and how they are replenished (Update - further plays have convinced that playing well involves taking advantage of gluts in the card market - I have now seen several games won by those taking the oft-ignored double food card for the last several turns), but the complaint about the voice of the people luck factor is ridiculous. It's great thematically and creates a lot of tension. It also keeps the winner in doubt until the very end.

*8* (Initial Plays)
After first play I really enjoyed it. I purchased it not knowing lots about the game, but I had heard great things. It has simple action choices, but difficult decisions. I really enjoy competing with other cities for people. The game has some unknown information about what the people demand, which I like. Players must also feed their people or they lose buildings, so players cannot become to powerful. It can play 2-5 players well and games are usually tight. Games can get a bit long if players have AP, and the counting of the symbols and people every turn are tedious. players also must keep track of what other cities around them, so lots to keep up on. I almost need a piece of paper to keep tally, not a bad idea. Overall a great game and with more plays my rating might raise.

I think this is one of the most competitive, complex and difficult game i had in my all life.
Strategy is the true base of this game, and the development of gameplay is just not as you want but it's only as you would like it to be.
You can plan what you want but the game rules and you have to follow the evolution and try not to lose.
A must have, at least have a game time with this jewel.

I love the feel of this city building game. It is like playing a computer strategy game. The theme is thick and creamy. The only down side is that sadly there is a run away leader problem.  

Update: I played this for the first time in a few years. I still love it. It plays far more like a wargame than a Euro. What each player does hurts another player. It is hugely interactive: a long way away from these endless multiplayer solitaire games that get cranked out these days.

Build a city, grow your population, give them what they want, feed them. The idea of being able to attract citizen from neighboring cities because you have more of the cool stuff is, itself, quite cool. That actually grabbing people from other cities might be a liability didn't occur to me until I played. The tension around balancing population growth and the ability to feed that population surprised me. In a good way. I'm interested in trying it again.

RATING: 5.5
I'm concerned with the action card stack becoming stagnant when played by the rules, and it moving too fast and thus weakening some of the tight economy aspects of the game when played with the varient where an action card is tossed every time a player plays one of their own three cards.

When played with the card flushing variant hospitals are nowhere near as valuable , but this is balanced by the higher frequency of architects and other building cards.  I've come to quite like the variant.  Rating raise half a point and may still rise another half point.

I'm very tempted to toss the annoying little plastic men and just use cubes.

The game has an inherent run-away leader problem that is a natural consequence of the game's basic design. I discussed this issue on my blog in an article I wrote on the complications that result when a game implements resource attrition as a function of direct player interaction. I specifically used La Citta as an example. Check out the link here:

http://mike-compton.blogspot.com/2007/12/triangulation-issues-in-resource.html


I used to rate this game a "1" because I claimed it is broken. From one viewpoint it is. However, I also understand that other games with the same problem of resource attrition (i.e. Twilight Imperium) and multiple players in the game are not necessarily games that I rate a "1". This is due to the fact that a game's "brokenness" depends on your point of view. In games like Twilight Imperium, it becomes more about negotiation and less about equal opportunities for victory. So, I've upgraded my rating of La Citta to a 2.

Tight, elegant, tile game with a city building theme. The population movement is an interesting mechanism that keeps the tension high. Requires both spatial as well as majorities thinking, and has a hefty dose of screwage.

On the minus side, it can get quite long with more than 3 people, and the production is subpar for modern standards (not easy to discern features, meeples should be colored, cards have no text et al). This game needs a modern graphical overhaul to shine.

La Citta strikes a perfect balance between planning, accounting for hidden information and being able to screw with your opponent.  Its also nice that you can spend a card to reduce the amount of unknown information if you desire (and the card is available).  Or, if you think you're clever, you can allow another player to spend THEIR card to view the info and deduce what they saw from their subsequent actions....leaving you with your action intact to use at your leisure.  (Of course, that's riskier.  You have to think you're really clever to pull that off.)  It will be a shame if this isn't reprinted in English sometime soon.  The components are also beautiful.

RATING: 7
Punishing of mistakes, and long for a German game, but still fun. In the tradition of many great games there are many things you want to do, and no time to do them all. The only random elements can be reduced either with house rules (fresh random action cards each year) or by taking an action (to look at the voice of the people cards). The modular board greatly adds to the replayability factor though it does start to feel formulaic after repeated plays. My main complaint with this is the set-up and play time; both of which are on par with true heavy weight games like Age of Steam while offering a decidedly lighter experience. Still wouldn't mind playing this game on occasion, but sold it as I have many other games that I want to play more and was able to recoup my entire investment because of its OOP status.

Sick of "OK Filler" games?  Track down this one (OOP but available at Biffleys.com as of 8/20/03).  This is a _very_ welcome heavyweight German game with similar complexity and depth as Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence.  Although it's not _quite_ as good as either of those two masterpieces, it's definitely worth a few plays.  Like others have said, the theme is strong and has a civilization-building sort of feel.  A negative- the decisions are usually pretty simple and there's practically no room for creative, inventive strategy beyond working within the mechanics.

First play (2 players) impressions:  Decent components and well written instructions.  It's a well balanced game with tight decisions to be made each turn.  There is some randomness in the array of political cards that will be available as well as the influence cards each round.  It's important to maintain a balance throughout the game, both in numbers of citizens as well as types and strengths of improvements, all the while watching what other cities are doing that may threaten your cities.

The more I play La Città, the more I'm beginning to feel that my initial enthusiasm wasn't warranted. At first I felt intrigued by the sprawling cities and opportunities to find sufficient food and water for the masses, but at the same time it's nearly all you do in this game. Plus, of course, getting money and erecting prestigeous buildings. For a game which lasts as long as it does, that's not much to keep the players occupied. What makes things worse is that the game gets in the way of the players at times. Take for example the Voice of the People: it takes a relatively large amount of actions to yield sufficient information; and if you know what the people think there is still the problem of acting on it without causing food shortages in your own cities. The political display tends to clog up with useless cards unless you play with a variant which sees a healthy rotation of them. And then the little meeples! The game looks very cool because of them, absolutely true, but the neverending associated counting and bookkeeping becomes a chore. Finally, the game seems to be prone to a sort of reversed runaway leader issue which reminds me of the process called Ostwald ripening: large cities are always more powerful than small ones, meaning that small cities stay small and tend to decrease in size while large cities stay large and tend to grow (albeit slowly) because of the attractive pull they exert. The action 'Found a New Castello' is therefore practically worthless after a while. In summary: although there are some nice aspects, there is plenty of roughly hewn stone which could stand a lot of finishing work.

Truth be told, I've always played the game using the standard setup, where I was able to more or less prove rigorously that players should always go for exactly 3 castellos. With 2 their empire grows too slowly, and with 4 it inevitably runs into food problems which offset the larger scale population growth. What I do not know is whether the full game, with randomly placed resource tiles, suffers from a similar problem or not. I suspect it does as the maths don't change, and in grain-rich areas there will be such strong competition that this is a limit in itself. If this is indeed the case, then La Città's rating will take a big nosedive.

Components: Lots of sturdy components. The citizens stand up surprisingly well. The art is perhaps too detailed on the buildings, which are difficult to distinguish from each other.

Experience: Interesting game of civil growth. Having the three areas of emphasis voiced by the people is a simple, engaging way to let cities have an assortment of buildings, without each city having numerous special powers. I also appreciate that the voice of the people mechanism, along with the random assortment of cards up for grabs, helps to make each of my turns slightly different. However, overall I don't find the game to be too fun. The central mechanisms—budgeting for population and food, and trying to steal citizens from nearby cities—doesn't do much for me.

A good game, and a heavy one. Seems to me (with 2.5 plays) that recovery from errors is very difficult, and the long play time (where you have no chance of winning) is a minus on this game.

Set in the Italian countryside, this game features various city-states vying for population. Each player is given two cities to start with, and is charged with expanding the different aspects of the cities to attract larger populations. Players build farms to feed their people, quarries to finance their expansions, marketplaces to allow growth in their cities, and bathhouses to keep their people clean and healthy. Additionally, structures can be built that give the city influence in one of three categories. Superiority in one of these categories will cause population to shift from other nearby cities when the Voice of the People is decided at the end of each turn. At the end of six turns, the player with the most victory points, which are determined from well-rounded cities, well-fed populations, and overall size of population, will be the winner.

I like city building games, and this one is very interesting with the stealing people from other peoples cities, if yours is better, and thus also decreasing their city's size!

I like this one better now that I've played enough to see the subtleties. For example, do you really want to make an effort to come out ahead during migration if you may not be able to feed your new citizens? I still prefer Puerto Rico for a quick civilization-building game, but La Citta works, too.

So close to a brilliant game. Growth/building/competition all work very well. Starvation mechanic too, making sure you keep your population managed effectively.

But some starting positions are just better than others. If you start off in a situation where it is difficult to get and increase your food supply, you're just plain in a bad situation.

I'm still exploring La Citta, but I'm liking it. There's strategy and interaction, math and second-guessing your opponents. I have only played two-player, and it would seem that the board does a great job adapting for the number of players. At first, this game might seem as if you have plenty of time to build up, but the reality is that the competition between cities comes quickly. That means you really have to watch, calculate and counteract your opponents' moves. If you don't, the game can be over pretty early because its hard to make a comeback.

RATING: 8
After a few plays I have decided to rate this game 8. It really falls in the category of games I like.

Pro´s:
+ There seem to be a lot of ways to win. For example in one game I had a very, very bad start with the city I wanted to use as a corn producer. One guy built into my influence region in the first round and started stealing my citizens. While I first thought that my game would be over after just a few minutes of play, I was able to adept my strategy and won in the end. So I can´t see the runaway-leader-problem some gamers are complaining about.

+ It is possible to play this game aggressively. Something I miss in so many other games.

+ The theme of the game is great and doesn´t feel pasted on. While playing, I really feel like I´m managing some cities.

+ The amount of luck is at the right level. Just like in games as Euphrates & Tigris and Wallenstein there are some things you don´t know for sure and you have to deal with this dilemma. The one who does this best normally wins.

Cons:
- This is not especially a problem I have with La Citta, it is more a general complaint which also applies to La Citta. The end of the game seems to come  at a random point. You play n rounds and then the game is over. I prefer it if the game comes to an end "naturally" like it happens in games like Chess or Hive.

When I first played this game, I thought it may just be the best civilization game ever.  But then, with the each repeated playing I found out that I was less and less thrilled.  And the final verdict: the game is fiddly, but I can live with that.  Crucially however, it has much much too big a 'rich get richer' problem to be interesting to play.  It is very boring if you find out after 15 minutes that you have no chance of winning at all (and partially because of the luck of the cards at that) but have to endure the agony of another two hours of watching your cities being crumbled by the opponents.

Good meaty strategic city building game. A little bit too much counting and fiddliness for my tastes. The score would go up if it were shorter.

In the end, it just wasn't the right fit with our group so I traded it away.

All this talk I hear about there not being a good Civilization game doesn't make sense.  This game is incredible.  Just a perfect city building game.

If so, call this the perfect Zeus/Ceaser citybuilding game.

RATING: 7
After 1 5er play, this is a tough one to rate.  Because I'd like to try it again, it is currently a 7.  I like the entire process of building up your civilization...making tradeoffs along the way.  It could go up or down a point, but doubtful it does much more than that..unless we got some rules wrong.  Tallying up food/citizens is a pain and lengthens the game a bit.  This game took us around 4 hours to complete.  I'm ok w/long games.  But the estimate of playing time on the Geek is too low.  Hopefully this will come down with repeated plays because I think that took a bit of the fun out of it.

Finally got to play it again w/4 players.  Play time came down to 2 hours.  The end-game scoring feels strange.  Hard to put it in words.  Cities are worth 3 or nothing. Population is worth 1/person.  Overpopulation is -5.  So scores are always going to be close since everyone will put down between 2-4 cities (probably all 4).  Most of those cities are going to be worth 3 points.  So it really comes down to supportable population.  And a -5 means you have probably just lost.  Build those farms!

Five of us played La Citta. Two of us vowed to never play it again. I was one of them. It seemed overly long, arduous, and generally not really fun at all. It seemed to have some reasonably tough decisions, but there was not enough fun in the game to really make them worth making. The game dragged endlessly to the point where I wanted it just to end eventually, and ceased caring about who won.

RATING: 8
Rock solid game where players take on diety like roles and nurture their cities and citizens. With a limited number of actions in each of the six turns, there are numerous decisions to be made - ensuring there is enough food, attracting citizens (ie. victory points), improvements to your cities, and so on. Large and lavish production, excellent and rewarding game play.

A clever game of development. A "middleweight" for sure. It has enough complexity to make it more interesting than Settlers, yet it is not so complex that the interactions and consequences lead to over-analysis of any type. Game has tradeoffs between quality of cities vs quantity (should I build those extra cities or improve my cities?) and also in resource gathering. Clever systems for the "will of the people" and the action cards too.

RATING: 5.5
This missed the mark for me. It is too fiddly for its own good. The rules are redundant (about things that aren't important). Rule details and special cases are not stated outside of examples at times. The rulebook itself is poorly organized. After learning the game, it was really quite straightforward, albeit taxing at times. My biggest concern with the game is the amount of time and thinking it takes, offset by the chaos of the conflict aspect of the game. There's definitely a nice game in there, but one you would have to play often - and I for one, will probably not.

A game I traded and reobtained which means I really should keep. This I think comes closest to being that 90 minute civilization style game that people try to create and fail at. You don't muster armies, but do combat over population and try to get people to migrate to your city. There's considerations that need to be made about feeding your people, keeping hygiene up, school and education and other considerations that make a civilization. The problem also is that it is a bit gamey and I feel does a civilization style game fairly well, not everyone sees the game that way. This is one that I really wish I played more of though.

Fascinating strategy game with some meaningful decisions - and a terrible end game, particularly for a close ending. My one play of this, myself and my main opponent spent the round waiting for a good card to turn up (most of the cards were now useless, do to some arbitrary game rules). He ended up getting all sorts of goodies - I got squat, and went from up by a few to down by one. Not a good way to end what was up until then, a great strategy game.

La Città has an interesting concept and game play. 
I enjoy it quite a lot. Building improvements for your cities are great. Will your city prosper or will you lose people to rival cities ?

I recently replayed this game. I had a wonderful time playing the game with the players I played with.

La Città takes a good 3-4 hours to play a full game with 5 players. It's the type of game which the 3-4 hours you spend are very enjoyable and doesn't feel like you play that long.

Unlike some other games which I played before which were long and boring...and made me want to leave the table yelling like an insane madman.

The time spent playing this little gem is well worth it.

The last time La Città was played, the game went very fast. We were quite surprised at the rate we were playing the game. We played probably our fastest game of La Citta ever. We enjoyed every minute of it. Of course it was with 5 experience players so there wasn't alot of dead time.

Wow, I really like this game!  After only one play, I'm ready to toss Agricola, Steam, Puerto Rico, and Citadels into the fire.  This game, I feel, has the best components of those games (tile laying, worker management, role selection, strategy) without feeling like a total rip-off. 

Players are Italian princes that are building cities on a map that loosely reminds me of Catan.  There are certain tiles you must place buildings next to in order to receive resources or be able to expand the population of your city.  Citizens are needed to occupy the various buildings in each city.  The hook to this game is the 'voice of the people' mechanic.  Cards are randomized at the beginning of the game and once a year you find out what the citizens desire to remain content with your city.  There are 3 categories; culture, education, and health.  If you don't have what they want, you get to sadly watch as the citizens in your town choose to relocate to a neighboring city owned by an opponent.

I'd like to play it again, in fact I'm insisting my gaming group tackle it next week :)  A 3 player game, with setup, took us close to 3 hours, but I hope to knock that down to the estimated playtime of 100 minutes soon enough.  

Update:  We were able to give the game another go this past weekend.  One member of my group feared the game would have little to no replay value and he was terribly wrong.  I do wish we could try it 4p instead of just 3, so we would have access to the whole board.  It's very, very tough to get a food engine going if the better food tiles are randomized to sections of the board that can't be used.  Even with that hindrance, I still had a fantastic time playing the game.

Mildly interesting game with horrible graphics quality.  Different buildings all look alike, and tiny gray citizens make your urban centers look like cities of the Soviet undead.  Luck and skill both play a role in this game, but I'm unsure whether the luck factor is too high.  In a few cases, card draws and player order conferred significant advantage.  My opinion, seconded by spouse: not enough interesting strategy decisions.  Rating of 5.33 a composite of my rating, my sister's rating and my wife's rating (5, 6 and 5, respectively).

[2 plays] There are some novel aspects of this game that I like.  I liked the voice of the people, and the fact that La Città is like many games in being about competing civilizations (cities, nation-states, city-states, whatever), but unlike most of them in that it's not done through military conflict.  For once you don't arm up and go conquer your neighbors; you just make your city-state so fabulous that all their people want to emigrate.  It can still get pretty vicious, though.  And you can spend most of the game ironically poised between the Scylla of having your people emigrate, so that you have to destroy buildings, and the Charybdis of having new people immigrate whom you won’t be able to feed.  There’s also the fact that if you don’t know what the voice of the people will be, you may not know what to do, but if you spend actions on the voice of the people, then you’ll know what you want to do but won’t have the resources left to do it.  The city placement and growth have a Catan sort of feel, and like Settlers of Catan, initial placements are wildly important.

There's a great deal to like here.  I especially enjoyed the way that the game creates difficult, thematic choices for the leader, allowing the straggler to come back after a poor start.  Well, I only have played once, with two, and that was my experience anyway as the unfortunate straggler.  I had one of those pathetic cities that acts as nothing more than a feeder of its own population growth to a neighboring metrolith, turn after turn.  

The migration mechanic is really excellent, but it feels like it wants to be part of a bigger, longer game (and perhaps that game is Antiquity, we'll see one day).  The mathematically interesting but thematically simple Voice of the People makes me long for a game that gave the topic a more loving treatment, including refugees from sustained war.  And I agree with whoever said that it would be nice to have individually colored citizens so you could see how the migrations occurred.

It satisfies more as a typical Euro thinker, rather than as some sort of Civ-lite.  The commonly cited design issues are true, but are only marginally distracting.

This is one of those near-miss games that could've been a real winner were it not for a few fatal flaws. The biggest of these is the card track gets clogged with less than desirable cards and the last thing you want to do is take a mildly helpful card only to reveal a truly useful card for someone else. Secondly, as the board fills up, the calculations of which citizens will to which cities forces players to slow down and consider all angles which bogs the game down in AP and agonizingly slow turns. What's worse is that you don't feel an arc to this "calculation management" but rather a sense of doing the same thing over and over. 

Overall, it chugs down the runway but doesn't achieve lift off. Really wanted it to work, and I heard others with the same complaints had ideas for variants, but I traded mine.

I enjoyed playing La Citta. This was my second 3-player game and this time we had the rules properly understood. I kept my food supply up mainly by lucky use of the Rich Harvest cards, but made the odd mistake in timing my development. Mike went for 2 big cities that constantly sucked farmers from two of my three cities. In the end, he beat me by just 2VPs, based purely upon sucking 2 last citizens from me. Richard was learning the game and couldn't sustain his third city through constant suckage. He lost it twice in the same place, and when he rebuilt it elsewhere, the game was over. I'd like to try La Citta as a 4 or 5 player game. The rules and cards are really basic, it would help if I had a player aid to keep track of my citizen/food ratio. Timing becomes crucial, and taking money at the right points lets you build a strong city. But being Close To The People early on gives you a distinct advantge.

Good game, but the first time I played it it took too long, and the suggested board setup made for a rather dull game. (The setup was TOO well-balanced.) Looking forward to trying it again.

RATING: 7
Players: 2-5
Duration: 3 hrs.
Type: strategy, city building, worker management, area control, set collection

Like: Nice insert designed for pieces. The board setup can change from game to game, with advanced rules which engenders replay-ability. Rules clearly written. the People's defection/relocation mechanic, very clever--one I have not seen before. A player has to be very careful of its use because a defection may cause a loss of action for the player who built the more attractive city. 

Dislike: Small fiddly pieces; Setup extremely fiddly and time consuming; It also takes patience putting away; I find the color scheme hideous; Cards are small and hard to shuffle. These numerous reasons have made it very difficult to get it to the table--other games are just more inviting. Only repeated encouragement from others, especially Iron Gamer, has finally brought it out again. I believe the Hospital to be an over powering building which can only be built with a card--therefore, a strong luck feature of the game when that card appears. Long with a lot of player downtime because planning ahead is not always possible, and recalculating necessary. 

Tough decisions and a lot to keep track of. To help keep track, and reduce time spent by repeatedly adding up advantages, people, and food before each turn and at the end of each year, found this score-keeping file here on BGG, Citta Ref.doc, by txaal, essential (going to laminate & use wipe-able markers).

The unusual mechanic gives a nice 7 score to this game. I didn't rate it higher due to the length (3 hours min. at best) and because a lot of time is devoted to rechecking & recalculating even with the use of score keeping aids. In addition it is just fiddlier than I like, and playing mistakes are easy to make. Still it is a strong game with hard decisions, and many possible decisions so that players often make surprising moves.

Due to the length it is going to be harder to get this to the table, but am looking forward to more plays.

When we refer to this game in our group, we call it the "PLANTE TABARNAK!!!" game.  This roughly translates into "Sow, goddamnit!".  This came about when we realized how carefully a line must be threaded with the food management when all of a sudden you receive unexpected guests in your healthy, educated and cultivated cities.  The choices are bountiful and none so easy as a recipe to follow.  Be sure to keep an eye out for the political cards presenting you with unexpected opportunities, but mostly, never run short of food.  That one step back you take from your opponents cannot be made up without much effort.

RATING: 6
[City Building, Population Management, Resource Management, Planning, Card Drafting] [5P:6] First off, this is not a "Civilization game" in the Sid Meier sense of the word. La Citta is about supporting your citizens and growing your population - everything else is incidental. Your buildings are simply a means to an end - they don't contribute to your score at all. It's all about the people, which is pretty strange for a game where you spend a lot of time planning what to build. The rest of the time you're planning on how to feed your people. The theme works, but I'm not all that sold on the mechanisms. Kosmos has never been the development powerhouse that HiG or alea/Ravensburger is, so La Citta doesn't really flow as well as other Eurogames of similar complexity. Think Power Grid more than Puerto Rico. Also I realize that the board is already fairly large, but the physical game design leaves something to be desired. The food markers are not an ideal tracking mechanism, and having to recount your citizens constantly slows the game down. There's a lot to talk about, particularly in whether the game HAS to go 6 rounds and last 2-3 hours, but in the end La Citta seems to fall into the "good not great" light-mediumweight German game category.

This a heavy city building game where you try to build cities, manage population and food, and enter conflict with other cities.  I like the idea of the game with the fixed number of turns and strategic combat element but the length really drags it down.  I have played this game only twice and both times it took well over 2 hours to complete.  I can't see where it would ever be much shorter.  There seemed to lots of my 25 turns where I only had a couple of options which really limited my enjoyment.

In La Città, players build cities in order to attract as many citizens as possible. At the end of each turn, citizens move from their current place of living to any neighbouring cities that match their preferences better.

This directly leads up to the biggest issue I have with the game. While both thematically and mechanically, La Città is a fantastic game, unhindered migration results in the big getting bigger and the small getting smaller. Since there is nothing to dampen this effect the game effectively has player elimination: Once you've fallen behind a bit too much there is absolutely no way for you to come back. Part of the appeal is to not let this happen, of course, but there is only so much you can do.

I would certainly like to play this every once in a while, but I'm afraid I had much bigger hopes.

Requires the same kind of thinking as the original Civilization (the computer game). There is, however, no computer to do the math for you, so half of your time is spent counting and re-counting - a serious drawback as it can really slow the game down. On the other hand, as far as I'm concerned, Civ was and is the best computer game out there, and this was the best boardgame spin-off I had seen before Through the Ages came along (although these two games are very different and focus on different aspects of the computer game - on on territory, the other on culture). The same turn angst applies where you would need to do several things at the same time, but the resources available are very limited (and they all boil down to our one ultimate resource, time). This game, however, does not get off balance after a while, like the computer game does (and its official boardgame version, according to most opinions). Luck of the draw plays a serious part, but as in all good games, this risk can be managed by careful players.

Every round of every year has tough decisions to make. This game is nicely designed so that you are always short on some resource and the Voice of the People add just enough randomness to make for those "YES!" or "Oh Crap!" moments in the game. Players must keep an eye on everything going on in their city and neighbor's cities. Minor drawbacks are continuous counting of citizens and similar drawings on building pieces.

Rating is based on one four player game that took four hours (including presentation of the rules).  The game is beautifully produced and obviously well designed, but at least for me, it is too long and uninteresting to merit another play, at least anytime soon.  Get farms, get quarries, get people, get money, and hope to have the right colored arches when your city finds itself in conflict with another.  There are other games that are similar and won't take nearly as long.  Update: My game maturity index has improved to the point that I appreciate this game far more than I once did.  I'm hoping to get it into a 2 player rotation with my wife.

Great game of city building and management.  I really like how the population can shift depending upon the will of the people.  The components are very nice although it takes a little getting used to what each building looks like.  The little people are great.  Even though an English version is really hard to find now, I would still suggest going after the German version.  There is some text but I think after one play the language won't be a factor.

Strategy lovers look no further. If you're a Caylus, Power Grid, or Puerto Rico fan, this one is for you. A classic Euro (with a particularly dry theme to match) which emphasizes decision-making and long-term planning above all else. One really has to weigh their decisions due to the limited number of actions per turn. This makes for thoughtful, and interesting game-play, but it can also lead to analysis paralysis in some.

The board scales for the number of players, so it's enjoyable, and competitive no matter how many you play with.

But, I did find it to be a bit boring and dull, as did the Lady. Although, I'm not one for heavy-thinking, or heavy gameplay, and neither is the Lady. We both prefer a bit more fast-paced games, with a smidge of luck. We're not much for brain-drainers, and this is one for certain.

If you like a thinking man's game, then pick up La Citta.

La Citta is very cool, ingeniously-designed game whose reputation seems to have grown significantly since its release several years ago.  It's definitely cut from the classic German cloth, with streamlined mechanisms and tightly constrained choices pushing the game to its conclusion.  However, La Citta smoothly incorporates a lot of simulation-like elements, giving it a thematic richness that few German games have been able to achieve.

To win, you need to attract new citizens to your cities.  If your city is meeting its citizens' needs, people will actually immigrate from neighboring cities!  But you'll need to develop enough farmland to feed these people.  You'll need marketplaces and sufficient fresh water as your cities grow larger.  And where will you get the money to pay for all these civic projects?  I hope you've situated one of your cities where it can mine those valuable metals!  This all sounds a lot more like a computer game than a typical "Euro."  Yet all those elements are packed into a sleek and clever Euro game system without all the complications and exceptions and irregularities that one might expect to encounter in a simulation as flavorful as this.

The production design is needlessly ornate in places to the point that it interferes with being able to see what you have, and where. About the right length.

Rating after three plays with 5 players. Great game for strategics and tactics, agonizing decisions. Just the same some luck issues with what politics card is revealed by the player before you. The mechanics are greatly balanced but not so the victory points. The only victory points are given at the end of the game so you don't have actually an overview during the game who's first. Another issue is, in our 5player game the final results where within only 6 points spread (33p-27p). I would prefer greater gaps between players to feel that I won because my strategy was best and not I lost because I mixed up two buildings (ie. not getting that 3p bonus for three colors in a city which could be decisive). 

A comment on other commments: For all those who rated that game low because it's to longish or has fiddly bits or a 5-player game is to tenseful: you are whinies!

Played 5+  There is a settlers vibe about this game. Unlike Settlers there is no robber to hold back the leader which can make for a "rich get richer" situation. This game has a lovely feel. Don't be fooled by the passive theme, this is one tense game. You go to "war" with your opponents by attracting citizens from their cities to yours by building facilities that they desire. Upon analyses after a game the losers can be left feeling they lost it after the first turn but so what, the experience is delightfully all consuming. *UPDATE* Just played a great 4 player game, I think it might be at its best with this number though I have not played with 5 yet. I am bumping this up to a 9. Feb 07

*UPDATE* I have passed on the opportunity to buy my own copy of this game for £10. This caused me to reflect on how I feel and I have dropped my rating by a point. It is my kind of game, I enjoy the theme and the advance Settlers vibe but one player will normally take a miserable beating which is not a great feature of a game. If I bring it to the table I'll be taking time away from newer and more worthy games. June 14

Based on a 5-player game. 

I feel this game is very tight on one hand. On the other it has some unforgivable randomicity. It is not just the amount of luck that I'm comfortable with, especially with a game this long and analysis-heavy. I found it tiring. 

While I'm ready to admit that it's a very well conceived game: little rules, hard gameplay; I also think that you have sometimes little choice which is forced upon you by the cards and the map. 

It is a game that I'd play when other options are not present. I'd play again but I'm not certainly looking for an other game soon.

For all its "shortcomings" (long playing time, some imbalances based on starting positions), this is a great game, constantly engaging the players with tough choices.

Based on 1 play with 5 players, after 5 hours of play including going trough the rules. A bit lengty, but maybe because of inexperience or maybe because a lot of choices and you can only do 5 actions so you have to make sure you don't waist any of those moves (and afterwards still getting a negative result because of a thinking error :) ). With more experience this can be a great game if you have the time to play it.

RATING: 7
There's a great game lurking in here, but I think it needs a few tweaks to bring it out.

Notably, I think the order of the Migration/Feeding phases should be reversed. The food/population balance in La Citta is like walking a knife's edge -- one slip can result in catastrophe. Losing even one too many citizens can cause a death spiral if it results in losing buildings as well. By itself this is not a problem. But since emigration happens *before* you feed the people, you need to recalculate your plans every time your opponents build anything. And this recalculation is not easy so it slows the game to a crawl.

By feeding the people first, you can plan your entire turn (somewhat) in advance, and react to any unforeseen migration problems from the previous turn. You still need to plan, you still need to watch your neighbours, but not to the extent that you must "re-work the numbers" every time a building is constructed. Given the amount of calculation and consideration still present (La Citta is a very meaty game), this is a welcome change.

RATING: 8
Ötletes a "Nép hangja", elég sok a konfliktus, veszélyes a túlnépesedés, nehéz döntési helyzetek sok kényszerít&#337; er&#337; szorításában. Érdekes, hogy ezen izzasztó helyzetek a Szentpétervár melletti állapotra emlékeztettek, függetlenül attól, hogy a két játék abszolút más.

Egy kérdés motoszkál bennem: Ha éheznek polgáraim, akkor elmenekülnek, akár területet is veszthetek. Ez önmagában se túl jó, a szabály miért büntet ekkor még akcióelvétellel is? Úgy érezném logikusnak, ha ez a büntetés valami - a több polgár által megszerzett, s az éheztetés miatt meg nem érdemelt - el&#337;nyt kompenzálna.

Szépek a komponensek, de kissé zsúfolt a tábla a játék vége felé.

Egy játék után hirtelenjében ennyi.

This is a very nice game. The figures are nicely detailed. As a person with not too much luck with dice, I like this game since it doesn't use any. Yet...the game sometimes feels a bit static. Not too complex either. A downside for me is that there is not much interaction (beside stealing eachothers civilians) between players.

RATING: 7
Tentative rating of 7 after a handful of plays.  It's a good game, but it needs a better system of drafting the political cards.  There are two big problems, somewhat related:  1) The cards get extremely stale.  For example, if no one is in a food shortage, the harvest cards will fill up the card line.  2) Your ability to get a good political card seems largely determined by luck.

Food, food, food.  Forget about tying to dominate any of the three, instead focus on matching your opponent in the three areas, or at least beat a few and lose a few. In other words, try to get a net draw of people close to 1 or 2.  You don't want not to be able to feed them.

This is a good game for resource management, and a little strategic design.  I like the theme and the look of the game when done.  You feel like you are in a solitaire situation for the first 2 rounds, and then the group aspects kicks in, which is nice.

The down side is analysis paralysis, and the fact that early positioning mistakes can ruin your whole game.  Center board cities often get taken out by the end game, and there is little you can do to prevent that.  Also, the advisors look too much like the generic people.  I had to paind gold on their bases to make them stand out.

RATING: 10
This is a GREAT game. A perfect "civ" game that plays in 2-3 hours. Novel mechanics capture the feel of building cities, much like the computer game, SimCity, but you're competing against each other!

Although it seems like a civ game on the outside, the game quickly becomes chess-like, with life-or-death moves on every turn. Your cities grow or shrink, depending on how well you've built your infrastructure--health, education, or cultural services--compared with your neighboring cities. Over six years/turns, you can watch your cities blossom into overflowing metropolises, or watch them die a slow, festering death, as the people get "sucked" to "better" cities.

It's immersive, putting almost complete control of your "empire" (well, not really, it's just two to four cities) in your hands. Are you a good planner? Manager? Visionary? It takes all that to overcome the seemingly random, and chaotic nature of the Voice of the People, which determines what services the people want, and if neighboring citizens will come to your city or your own will flee to greener pastures. The Hand of Fate is in every play, as what you can or cannot build will be dicatated by the random Political action cards, but you can always fall back on default actions.

The drawback is the time commitment. 20-25 minutes to explain the rules. 3-3.5 hours for a 4-5p game. May get shorter as players in my group get familiar with the game. The game is fiddly in the set-up and take-down: there are lots of tiles and citizen figures. Because of this and the slightly excessive playing time, I give this a '9', even though I really want to give this a '10'. Only time will tell if this becomes a frequent favorite.

The components are fabulous, the citizen figures are small, but detailed, and the rules are very well written. I can see why this is ranked in the 100's, but one would think such novel and challenging gameplay wouldn't find itself in the top 50.

Okay, the game is a brain-burner for AP-types, much like Power Grid. It is somewhat forgiving, but the results from your mistakes will be telling from the early get-go. It seems as painful as Age of Steam, yet I like this game: it is not a spreadsheet like AOS seems to be. My winning or losing isn't kept track on some linear VP track; I literally watch the rise and fall of my cities, over a period of time, where the citizen figures are my VPs! I cheer when my cities grow. I am in anguish and feel like a failure when my people leave. There's plenty of uncertainty in the cards, but isn't that what being a politician is all about? Give the people what they want! And soon! And more! There's never enough! I need more time! The tension, coupled with the uncertainty, with the stunning visual appeal, makes this a winner. Someone commented that this feels more like a wargame than a civ-game, since there are area control and front lines. The feeling of winning/losing citizens is more like warfare than an exercise in civic planning.

Update (09/12/09) 5P game: 25 minutes to explain. 3 hrs 15 minutes playing time with moderate AP play near the end. This is not a game to bring to a boardgame meetup; one needs to dedicate a good chunk of an gaming evening to get this to the table, where players want a longer, meatier game--this game delivers that in spades. It seems starting a third city is essential to winning. Plenty of farms is necessary, while quarries are not--they're nice,  one or two is probably a good idea; three or four can be devastating, if the city(s) can survive the initial "attacks" from surrounding neighbors. In a fixed setup, 2-3 quarries is possible, but in a random setup, 4 gold quarries is a recipe for player collusion to take you out.

Update (09/16/09) 4P game: 20 minutes to explain to one person. 10 min setup. 2.5 hrs play. 10 minutes to put away. The 4P seems to be the sweet spot: enough space to expand and build with little conflict that is present in turn 1 of a 5P "random" setup game, and the tempo is just right. Introducing one or two newbies is the way to get a foothold on the table. One-two game veterans love this game--I love this game! However, the 4P has a probable weakness--one player will likely set up a city far away from everyone else in the "desolated" part of the board (i.e. one farm spot, otherwise rocks and lakes), and run away with the game, unless others move in too. 5P is crowded and cut-throat, but the game is designed for that number. 4P is more relaxed and leisurely in comparison. It depends one what the players want. I'm upping this to a '10'. A solid, deservedly "classic" game. If the English version of this had come out sooner, this surely would have been up there with Power Grid. 

Update (09/20/09) 4P game: 2 hrs 20 min with all veterans, and board previously setup. Gameplay is getting quicker with experience. New strategies are emerging. Original player aids are generally worthless. The new ones available are okay, but all are disconnected and don't have all the info. New player aid is definitely needed for newbies due to all the symbology, as there are no text anywhere! However, it is all intuitive after several plays. City tiles need to be sorted into trays, using a solution similar to Le Havre.

Update (10/14/10) 8 plays: first 3P game, took 2.5 hours. The feel of the game changes, where farms become far more  important than quarries (and money), since too much population growth is now the problem and not the other way around. All in all, a very close game: 34, 33, and 31 pts respectively.

Plenty of dilemas and tough decisions to make. Plenty of competition, but it appears hard to get really hurt as long as you have a spare man or two to lose at the voice of the people phase.

The make up of the board can be quite crucial especially re the number of farms you need. This was the worst aspect of the game as it was beyond the players control and can skew the game.

A complex balancing act that keeps you on your toes.  You need to keep up all the various aspects of your civilization throughout the game and will definitely lose ground if you let something slip.

The game can change drastically with different groups. 

I am not convinced that the advanced setup is an improvement over the set one. (4 plays)

With only 30 actions to take, everything counts, and watching a city die slowly is painful.  Just remember that a city only needs 3 buildings to score 3 points - castle, hospital and statue.  Four little cities can give you 24 points in this game and that's a respectable score.  Of course, it's better to have 4 LARGE cities, but you can't have everything.

Don't bother with the standard setups, go for the random starts every time.

Finally played this after owning it for years. Enjoyed it much more than Catan, which I often hear it compared to. I always felt in control of my fate, and even when I was losing people to other cities it felt fair and fun. But after one playthrough I asked if anyone wanted it and sold it on the spot.

Played it with 5 people. First play lasted a good 4 hours, but I can see it hitting the 2 hour mark with experienced or more engaged players. I still think it lacks depth for that length. First play of Antiquity lasted the same length of time and I loved it much more.

Would definitely play again, but I decided something else would better fill my shelf space.

Lots of fun ideas here but ultimately more trouble than it's worth. The graphic design is my main issue. The building tiles are a nightmare to tell apart from one another, the service arches on them are tiny and not at all easy to relate to the voice of the people cards, which use the same colours but not the same icons. Once you get past all that there's a decent, tight, competitive game here, but personally I found it all a bit more exhausting than I could really be arsed with.

Bought cheap on eBay and was really looking forward to playing this based on it's ranking on BGG. Very underwhelming few plays have made me sell it on. Everyone is forced down the same route of expanding by acquiring fountains/bath-houses, farms etc early on in order to avoid being unable to sustain the population. Even the vote of the people cards didn't really produce the excitement I was expecting from the game.

initial rating...

Excellent game slightly related to Settlers and Civ here. Build cities and collect resources, feed your people, has a slight war effect that if your weaker than the next city in the popular polled color you lose men. The poll reminded me of Die Macher and was just as random, this and the power/action cards were the only random elements. You also lose men if you can't feed them which takes some calculating and assuming. Good strategy title that was very tight for scoring, 4 player game had a 3-way tie for 2nd except for gold. This would scale very well and I will be buying it for 2 player games although good right to 5 I can see. Slight knock for being a little long but easily fixed by subtracting a round.

I didn’t have any expectation whatsoever, but I found a good game in La Città. The game looks gorgeous on the table, the components are very good too. The rules are easy to grasp, but the decisions needed in the game are very interesting and meaty. You have only 5 actions each turn and you have lots of options. The luck of the draw isn’t small, but I feel it doesn’t decide the fate of the game (most of the time).

An early mistake can take you out of the game for good, in general I like this kind game (Age of Steam, Antiquity, Myrmes) BUT in this case I don´t because sometimes you have to take decisions with incomplete information. That’s not the part I dislike (in fact I love that) because there is a mechanism to control it (a card that allows you to poll the voice of the people). What really bugs me is when you spend a costly action to look 2 of the voice of the people cards and that gives you no valuable information whatsoever (when the face up card is black, and you looked at a white card and at a blue card). I realize this has a low probability of happening, but in our game it happened twice, and one of the players guessed wrong so he finished last. In conclusion, I’m ok to losing the game in the first or second turn if it was my fault, but I’m not ok if I have to guess a path EVEN after I paid for a card so I didn’t have to guess. I also think this can be mitigated paying attention to what the other players cities are building. I need to play more times to see if this is really an issue or not.

La Città also has a “the richer get richer” feel because when you steal citizen you grow stronger and you maintain that strength while at the same time weakening your competitors, in this way you can achieve an unrivaled advantage. In out game there were 2 super cities and all others lost to them. These cities won from round one. I’m not sure if this is an issue for me, but I think not. Perhaps it was due to our inexperience, as I said before I need to play again.
 
The insert looks great, but it is useless because when you transport the game, all bits become disorganized :angry:, I will toss it and use bags instead.

I thought the “feed your workers” mechanism was invented around 2007 (Agricola) but this game is from 2000 and it causes a lot of tension, I love it.

Bottom line, I want to play again in the near future and I will keep the game in my collection. La Città has a lot of potential and perhaps it will get an upgraded rating. I feel I has lots of depth and I would like to explore it.

So far only played with the "beginners" set up, and only with 2P. But it seems to deliver what I was hoping... an efficiency game but with a spatial component and several unusual elements, such as theft of each other's population and the ability for your "economic engine" to shrink if you do it poorly.

RATING: 7
A very clever design with some unique elements. The 'Voice of the People' scoring and the related emigration rules in particular provide a unique take on conflict / player interaction. (It is very interactive for a Euro, which I like).

It can be quite brutal - if you get hosed early on by the Voice of the People it's a long road back. Not saying that's a bad thing, but it is something to be aware of. Even winning these conflicts can be a problem if you don't have enough food to feed the people you leech off the opposition - 'build another farm' is rarely a bad idea.

It looks nice, but some of the colour / design choices could have been better. The yellow player castles are almost the same colour as the building tiles. Having the arches aligned the same way across all tiles played helps when parsing the board.

All in all, could be the perfect Euro for wargamers!

When this game was first released I played many, many times and found it to be just so-so, and only rated it a 6.  I played it again, after a long hiatus, with a different group of players and I had a totally different experience!  A lot of strategies appeared that did not seem to present themselves in the first few playings, and the game was ultimately much more fun.  Maybe it pays to revisit a game after dismissing it as being poorly designed, eh?  My rating for La Città  has improved as well.

I played this game with my brother. After just one game, he would not stop pestering me for a rematch. I played that fool like a pimp with his bitches. The game is satisfying in every way.

One of my favourites! It can take well over 30 minutes to explain the rules if you don't read them beforehand and even then. After a couple of plays it will become much easier though. Has nice game mechanics like the collision of cities, which remind me of Eufrates and Tigris, but it is far less abstract. I always want to know the will of the people! (14 aug 06 after 7 plays)

RATING: 6
La Citta is more about population control than city building. Case in point, your city cannot grow without citizens and your city collapses when citizens leave.

The buildings themselves are really of little consequence as both large and small arch buildings are worth the same at games end. The larger buildings will help you attract citizens during the game but then you may not be able to feed them which will in turn cause those citizens to leave thereby destroying your city.

This concept is really cool and should fill each session with tension and brain melting goodness; unfortunately my sessions have been undone by monstrous AP and downtime, sucking out all the tension in the game. The sessions end up being way too long for the game's depth.

La Città is a game that pulls a bait-and-switch... a really, really good one.

At first glance the game appears to be about farming, mining, and building. Those may be the fundamentals of the game, but on closer inspection they exist to enable a much more interesting concept: the ebb and flow of population. Each turn, the "voice of the people" cries out for better education, culture, or public health, and cities will flourish or wither depending on how they answer the call. In this way, players compete directly with each other, trying to siphon off population, perhaps sending a once-proud city into ruin and signaling the rise of a burgeoning capital. Growth is not always good, though. If a city cannot support it's people via sufficient farmland, it may be desirable to lose a competition with another city. In fact, even if a city can sustain more growth, allowing population to migrate to a struggling neighbor becomes a form of attack, inflicting starvation and ruin. This is why La Citta works. Its three basic elements - upkeep (farming), currency (mining) and hidden information (voice of the people) - create a system in which cities function as magnets. Managing their relative force is the game.

Unfortunately, there does seem to be a glitch or two in the mechanics. In our game, the people wanted culture early on, enough so that players knew it would never be valued again in the last 2/3 of the game. But, it was only after they wanted culture that the option to build culture-specific buildings (cathedrals etc) came up. Essentially, the action-menu (7 cards) became clogged with actions no-one would ever take, drastically reducing options and increasing luck. Not cool.

So, while I thoroughly enjoyed the concept of La Citta, I'm not sure how often the game glitches out. Proceed with caution.

RATING: 7
Building a city in La Citta is similar to the computer game Civilization - which is great for me. The more crowded the map gets the more interesting the game. If you mess up your strategy and can't feed your citizens you'll be penalized immediately and probably won't win any more. You also can get stuck with a city not being able to grow any more. I like this unforgiving part of the game. There are a few drawbacks though. The colours are hard to distinguish and the small citizens make the game a bit fiddly. The action cards cycle to slow and you'll get stuck with a nearly useless display too often. Luck comes into play when one player gets better card draws than others. All in all a good game that leaves you with a feeling of accomplishment.

The problem with the game is that it's a significant investment in time, but usually at least one player is completely out of the running within the first couple of rounds. And will then have to stay in the game, and watch his position become more and more desperate.

If it weren't for that fatal issue, La Citta would be great.

RATING: 7
Solid game - I can tell that this could have a definite chance of going up in rating.  My main reservation is the game length, which may be a result of playing with all first timers.  The theme is actually kind of fresh, mainly because of the migration of the population.  There are a lot of things to keep track of and there doesn't seem to be one particular path to victory.  As the game progresses, the actions become more cutthroat - even though you never attack anyone, it feels quite vicious.

An unique game about city building and controlling population. Players have to balance between getting money from quarries, food to feed the people or buildings that provide what the people want. The map is quite small and forces players to jostle for position. This game has some interesting mechanics, but I found it too dry and confrontational for my liking.

RATING: 7
This game gobbles up newbies and spit them out.  In all the games I played, someone was always struggling just to survive.

After two playings with 5 players and the beginning setup, it seems like the rich farm spots (purple, pink, yellow) have a big advantage.  Will no longer play with the beginner setup.

Played with a random setup with 5 players, and I think it is even harder to come up with balanced starting settlements.  I am coming to the conclusion that this game is just too tough for 5 players.

Finally played it with a number less than 5 players.  Wow!  It really makes a difference.  The game is no longer determined by the initial layout.  The 3rd and 4th cities are much more of an option.

My advice--do not play with 5 players (I'd rate it a 5).  With 4 players, I rate this a 8.

A thinking man's game, where balance and timing is everything.. 
Get either wrong and you may fail miserably - falling behind in the process.
Manage the challenges well and watch your cities thrive and blossom.
The tension is palpable and the planning crucial, which does make it catching.
Think CIV building game, without armies and wars or conquests, yet it elegantly 
creates fierce competition but also some animosity between the players.

Ooh, I do want to give it 8, but the game mechanism are very static and slightly bothersome, and you do have a feeling of being a spectator on occasion.
Early "wipe-outs" are severely difficult to recover from, runaway leaders are hard to catch. Lacks room for creative strategies, too - and your true options are limited.
Beware of "Analysis Paralysis" in this one..

RATING: 8
Scales well from 2-5, though it is more chaotic with more since you have more interactions and more card turnover.

At the end of each of the 6 turns, you defend your city from influence with 1 (occastionally 2) of 3 colors you must add to your city determined by the VOICE OF THE PEOPLE.  These are represented by 4 cards, only one is face up.  This aspect is the only imperfect knowledge of the game, but can be mitigated by using an action to peak at the face down cards.

Scoring is very simple, 1 point per citizen, and 3 for each "well developed" city (meaning has atleast 1 of each 3 colors).  The real trick is finding enough farm space to feed a high population count late in the game.

My main complaint is in the latter rounds (say the last 2 of the 6) as the board gets hard to distinguish since for each city only a single tile represents player color, and all citizens and city additions are generic in color.
Also, it starts taking a while to add up arches, # of citizens, and if you have enough farms to feed them.

Kosmos / Rio Grande - circa early 00's.  $20. Intense 'mind' game. Even though it is not your turn, there is a lot to mull over.  The 'citizen' pieces would be an excellent addition to 'Puerto Rico'. Instead of the flat brown wooden discs use the La Citta pieces.  Good idea to get new politics cards every year or else the game cards get bogged down with Harvest cards which nobody can use.  Has happened once out of 20 games but it is better to change them out.

A lot of fun, and simpler to play than it looks (each round has a rhythym to it that you can pick up quickly). I need a better grasp of strategy, and am apt to rely on the crutch that your short-term actions are dictated by which Political Cards are available. That scoring only occurs at the very end makes it hard for me to weigh my performance midgame. Works equally well for 2 or 5; I have only played it s a 3-player once, and have a vague recollection that one player got squeezed between the other two. The tension between wanting to attract nobles and to avoid the -5 starvation in the last round can turn into a seriously delicious tension. Does this really need a Renaissance Italy theme? It is a theme I enjoy, but this game could have any kind of historical or fictional setting, and placing it in the Renaissance when so many other games are seems gratuitous. I think I'd rather we were building up little Fertile Crescent city-states, and maybe instead of the 3 services, each could be represented by a different ancient god to whom your city could devote temples.

Very good civilisation-like game! Expand your cities while keeping population growth and migration in line with your farming capacity. Original mechanism for resolving "battles" between cities (a city attracts people from other cities based on the type of buildings and the vox populi of the moment). Make sure to build a third (or even fourth) city early on and close to farmlands. Low on luck and remains very close until the end (28, 28, 27 and 26 in one of my previous games).

Interesting game that requires some thought, but isn't a heavy brain-burner. Not very prone to AP, as it's quite easy to assess the situation, but you have to pay attention all the time as the situation is changing constantly. 
Anyhow, slow players will play this slow too. Also, it's fun to make "slluurp" noises when sucking people from other cities :) 
Accommodates different number of players well.

This is a longish game featuring complex planning with limited resources.  The hidden nature of the voice of the people adds some element of chance to the outcome of each round.

One play.  5 players.  My first game was a major disappointment.  I don't know why I was expecting a "kinder" game, but this game does NOT forgive a mistake.  I suspect there will be more leeway with fewer players though.

RATING: 7
As much as such a thing is possible, this feels like somewhat of a crossover between Settlers of Catan and Tigris & Euphrates.  You build and harvest resources while trying to keep supremacy in the different categories of services.  It's a reasonably fun game but initial placement plays a HUGE role and random then makes up for another non-negligible part of the result.  It would be better if it wasn't so long (2h even with only 3 players).  On the upside, it scales fine (although I've never tried it with 2 players).

RATING: 4
Fortunately, most elements of the game seems to be logical and make sense which is surprising compared to many euro games that use weird illogical mechanics.

But the reason why I drop the rating to 4 is that there are various annoying stuff in the game which drops seriously my interest.

There are various flaws in the physical design of the game. First, the buildings are all the same color, so it gets hard to identify which building is what. They should have clearly identified each building so that at glance, you know if you are missing a special building or not. 

Second, the player pawns are similar to the population piece and placing the pawn on the side of the arch on the tile is very confusing. They should have given 3 colored tokens: black, blue and white. This way, the analysis would have been easier.

Third, since the first game you play you should start with a fixed setup, they should have made sure that the information was written directly on the board for the city location and the resources. Then you would have used the resource triangles if you want to change them.

Fourth, it is not indicated on the fountain that it can make you grow more than 8 population.

Now about the rules of the game:

First, the map design is bad. There is no resources on the side of the board, so expanding or starting new cities there is totally useless.

Second, you can start additional cities but there are few good spot to actually start new cities since like I said before, the sides of the board are worthless. I thought that with less player you would build more cities, but that is not the case since with less players you do not use all the board.

Third, the fountain had the problem that if you forget to build a fountain, your city gets locked. The only way to grow is to lose some population, grow again and build a fountain. The fountain should have given you a free population like the market place did. Or allow you to place it without population.

Finally, the population movement make sense, but the analysis is so complicated especially when you are halfway through the game and when there is a tie in the colors. Part of this is because it is hard to know which city comparison has been done ( at least in china, each comparison is labeled) and second because of the poor component design explained above makes it harder to analyze.

So in overall, it could have been an acceptable game, but in the end it is not that good.

RATING: 7
This is a thoughtful-population planning tile-laying and growth/control game that requires careful attention to citizen migrations between all players' cities.  I suspect that being the central player on the map board raises the highest potential risk unless it is a powerful city.  Turn order is important as it seems mostly better to go last.  IMO it would be more balanced if all players move citizens and then limits are imposed in finality of that phase.  Overall, I think it is a heavy game but lumbersome (over 2.5 hrs) with a good deal of long-term nuances to think about.  Might possibly be best with 5 players or 3, but probably not 4 b/c of how the map is adjusted (no modification for 4?, hmmm...).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent game with too many choices with not enough time to do everything you want.  One seeks to build diversified cities in three different types of services (culture, health, education) which will attract citizens from other neighboring cities.  BUT, watch out for two things:  1.  Don't have more people than you have food available (particularly in the final round when its a 5 point penalty) AND 2.  Make sure to build a market with your fourth or fifth guy from a city or your city is doomed to stay at 5 population for the rest of the game at best!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Nice bits. Some interesting combinations within the mechanics, but ultimately the game was just not fun for me. Though there are many things you can do, too many of them are useless for a given turn. This gives the impression of strategic depth, but in fact your turn is pretty much decided for you in advance. But the most annoying part for me is the multi-player confrontational play with very little room for negotiation - noobs should be prepared to fight tooth-and-nail from the get go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very well designed building game.  Although I've played many building games, the mechanics here feel unique.  The graphic design could use some improvement -- the tiles seem to have been drawn with more concern for their beauty than their functional purpose.  The game is a little fiddly and late rounds can bog down in mathematical calculations.

I like this game, but feel that there's a bit too much complexity and fiddliness that it not matched by either its depth or the fun it brings.

We perceived some runaway leader problems on the first play.  When a player gets a big city going, it's so hard to stop it pulling away citizens from its neighbors, creating a feedback loop where big cities get bigger and smaller ones stay stagnant or get smaller.

However, it's a high-information game so you can see this coming.  It just requires players who can see this developing and take actions to stop it.  This would not have been obvious on the first play.

Game needs some kind of citizen markers to go with the food markers so one doesn't have to keep counting the figurines and comparing against food.  Homebrew this.

This game can EASILY be analysis-paralyzed to death.  It's a busy board but the options are not THAT vast,so PLEASE, when playing, plan your move during the other players' turns and take it in 30 seconds when the move comes to you.  This game should not take more than 2 hours to play.

Board looks great at the end... the theme is sold and I do feel as if I've presided over an expansion of city-states in the Italian countryside.  I would give this another spin, but the vast bookkeeping in the game convinced me to trade it away, so I don't see myself playing it in the near future, if ever.

A solid game - lots of tactical decisions to make each turn of the political phase, and a need to keep an overall stratgey going. The requirement to produce enough farm resources to maintain your citizen level (and thus not incur a penalty) is a nice added touch. Definitely a keeper in my collection.

After one play with 4-players I am mostly impressed. The rules are fairly easy to grasp and the gameplay rewards strategic over tactical play. In some ways, the game reminds me of Agricola (I've only played the solo flash version). In both games the players have to worry about feeding their citizens/families. The similarities probably end there, but the feeling was the same regardless.

Although I think this is a solid game, it is not without drawbacks. Specifically the icons bother me. The most important aspect on the hexes you play are the tiniest icons (arches, ">5", etc.). Now take these small icons then place citizens on them to make them even more difficult to see. Both of these aspects make it difficult to assess the state of the board. This is bothersome as there is a lot going on without the components getting in the way.

To be fair, these downsides are not very bad but they do make me wonder. The game relies on many interacting mechanisms to work well. There are so many mechanisms that it is quite possible to be overcomed by them all. With the questionable usability of the components, are mechanisms manageable or is this game merely glorified chaos? Only future plays will answer this question.

Finally, finally got this to the table. The colors in this game are terrible and were the main cause it didn't get played so far.
The game itself is fiddly. Small citizens, lots of tiles. Most of the turn is dedicated to bookkeeping.  Stuff built is destroyed on the same round.

All in all a frustrating game with lots of interaction and calculation. So not a bad game at all. If only the bookkeeping were easier.

My wife calls this game "Cary" for the local city that has all the nicest amenities so that everyone moves there.  A brilliant description of this game.  There is a lot to consider playing this, from the threats on your precious citizens to their food, all while developing your cities to maximize your score.  Establish a new city or expand the old one?  Build a hospital or a fountain?  Always more to do than you can, some tough choices and smooth mechanics make this an excellent game, though more antagonistic than most euros.

A really good game with interesting mechanics. Add the nice art of the city-piles and you have a great package. The only downside i can think of are the politics-cards with some not-so-useful cards and the randomness which somehow doesn't turn me down as much as it would in other games.

Played it a lot as a 2-player game lately and it's great for that purpose!

Also thinking about a change to ^ 9, since i found a variant which solves the problem with the useless politicss-cards. (http://files.boardgamegeek.com/file/download/93cg4n8tj/la-citta.txt)

RATING: 7
A clever area control game where you grow cities by acquiring tiles.  The tiles help satisfy a changing demand for services or provide food or money.  Cities that get big and get close to other players can may then take citizens from other players cities.  

Citizens count toward victory points at the end of the game.  

This is a game that rewards multiple plays.  If you start poorly, or make a error early, you will not recover.  

Gamers game not a family game.

RATING: 6
Highly rated game, but I wonder how much play it gets and how many of those ratings need some updating.  If I played this 10 to 15 years ago, I'm thinking it would have been a favorite.  The bar is pretty high these days for top notch games, and this falls pretty short. 

Maybe with a few variants it could be better.  Some mechanic to flush the politics cards would be a good start.  It's hard to 'see' the board.  I found myself counting population, food, and McCulture count over and over--not really an endearing quality in a game.  Not sure what can be done about that.

I want to like La Citta.  It's just got to meet me half way.

Strategy game, with some luck and a lot of planning. Scales well. Nice bits.
Its flaws are:
I) the cards aren't balanced and so sometimes you buy a card and the card that is revealed to replace it (and thus is avaible for your opponent) is much better than all the 7 you had available.
II) the "Voice of the People" is utterly random. Once in a while you can mitigate it with a "Polling the People", even if there's nothing worse than a Poll (not paying the extra 2$) revealing 3 different cards... and I'm inclined to believe that 2$ and an action is a bit overpriced for the full effect, especially since the other players can simply "copy" your next moves. Bluffing won't help unless you're the last player and can thus do some "surprise" action in the last turn; but if you go last will all the other players ignore that "Polling the People"?
III) the "3 food" tile is overpowered. If it comes near a "2 food" tile, whoever goes first during the setup has got a great advantage with no drawback. This is very bad for a "strategy game".
IV) once a city is "doomed" (at least two neighbouring cities "stronger" than it), there's no hope to save it. Losing persons means losing builings, that means losing more persons during later turns and so on. This can easily happen in the first half of the game (and having to play three other turns with no hope to win can be acceptable for a 30-minutes card game, but not in a 2-hour strategy game!).

In this game, you are trying to build cities that are enticing to live in. You construct buildings to enhance education, health-care and culture to woo citizens away from other cities to join you.

Okay, I really like this game.  It has depth, strategy, and enough player-screwage to make it fun.  The board is nice sized, and the 'peoples' figures are exceptional.  That said, the other pieces are sort of drab and a little hard to tell apart, and the game itself seems to take forever to play, and the setup takes almost as long.  Granted, as first-timers it probably took longer than normal, but even when I get my own copy I don't see this one coming out very often.

Interesting conception, but playing wasn't fun.

The reasons are:
1. It doesn't have so much civilization-building feel. All the tiles seems similar, there is little freedom in laying tiles, your city grows weird linear shape.

2. You don't have much choice. What you should do is relatively obvious.

3. Your possibilities of choice depends on opened cards. If cards allows you to do what you should do, you can do it. Otherwise, you cannot.

It is regarded as a kind of civ game, but I think it as middle-weight tile laying game, wanting to be a civ game. Important charmings of civ games have been cut down. In addition, it is long for what it is.

An under-exposed gem.  Filled with critical decisions, rife with opportunities for neighbor screwage, a very well-integrated theme and a great design.

Whoa...a lot going on in this game. Good stuff but watch playing it with players that like to think a lot about their turn.  Down time can be a bit of a factor.  I loved every minute of the game but it did eat a big chunk out of my game day.

I not fond of games with very few victory points available which usually means every point counts. Translation: as the game comes to a close it crawls to a halt while every player tries to maximize every single move, counting and recounting players positions, money, population counts, voice of the people probabilities, adjusting for new political cards being exposed, etc.

This is a good, fun city development game that is a bit fiddly.  Even so, I like games where you have to build up cities (or civilizations) so I enjoy this one.  The only competitive aspects are to draw settlers from competitor cities which you do by moving closer with your own development.

Another hit for me.  La Città is serious material for gaming's sake.  Even though it's an AP prone game, i so like the many choices offer by the game.  Wow.  The mechanism of attracting people to your city-state for being more "advanced" is very cool and unique.

Game in a Nutshell:  Players compete for space and population by expanding their cities so they can score points for having well rounded services to support as many citizens as they can get.

Played as:  3,4 players (preset boards), 3 player (random board)

Pros:  I love the balance between the goal of the game, which is to get lots of citizens, and how too many citizens can actually hurt you if your cities aren’t ready to support them.  It’s a twisted sort of fun to watch players get excited to steal a bunch of people from neighboring cities with their sweet health services only to later realize they don’t have the food to support their increased population.  All this is a result of a need for some perfectly blended strategy and tactics.  The interaction is direct but light enough to not offend easily.  I’m not sure why, but for some reason it’s easy for me to feel like I’m on the ground level with this map.  The Modular placement of the tiles on initial set-up really works since the map aspect feels more intimate. It’s a nice step up the Civ-building ladder from Settlers.

Cons:  Even though it works perfect thematically, I think the way it requires players to look ahead and plan for expansion may be a turn off for some.  You’re really playing now for what you need five moves in the future, so if you’re playing for immediate needs then chances are, you’re already behind the ball.  What I’m trying to say is there’s a level of concentration and planning needed that might make for a less enjoyable experience for some.  Some small niggly details that bother me: fiddly pieces (and lots of them), and at times it can be tough to differentiate your city from someone else’s.

Other:  I can’t help but think of this game as the best alternative for Settlers of Catan fans wanting to pick up an expansion.  Because of that, I think this game is undervalued and deserves more attention then it gets. Much tighter game as the number of players increase.

Best Use:  A true next step after Settlers or just a solid light-civ Euro with some good interaction and well implemented theme.

La Citta is a great game. I feel it gets some harsh comments because it is quite a bit heavier than it is made out to be: it is, or was, portrayed as "one of those" building-buying medium weight type of games, but is significantly more complex and unforgiving than any of those that might come to mind. La Citta scales remarkably well, but is probably the most fun experience with 5. However, it is also the most complicated with 5, as interactions and intertwining decision trees become increasingly more complex. It is impossible to play La Citta lightly, or to approach it "intuitively" based on the flow of the game. Repeated counting of your civilians is mandatory, combined with your exact estimates on possibilities for that number after migrations of the turn. Should you be off by one, chances are you get punished by one less action or 5 points deduction - both huge penalties. (I feel that each player should have had some aid to keep track of their crop+citizens in an easier manner to shorten the endless counting.)
In addition, early building purchases have a big impact on your further game, so planning is needed. 
But, once you get the hang of La Citta, it is a wonderful game, with excitement to the end. People who are whining about runaway leader problems are not playing the game properly: if something goes wrong early in the game with one of your cities, damage control is the key in this game, not: "oh, I'll try elsewhere". Letting go of something you've invested in is not an option.

Rating went up from '6' after a couple more playings.  Still feels a bit of a distillation of other games, but still a pretty nice tile-laying game with some twists.  Can run a little longish with four or five players.  We enjoyed the 2-player games we've done.  Wish there were more variations in the buildings.  Can run into situations where a losing player really cannot catch up.  Its a game that feels like ti could have been great, but never quite made it.  Still, decent enough to stay on the shelf.

Felt a lot like playing a weird version of T&E, with a similar playing time but without the classic elegance. You build up your position are are eventually in a position to "attack" the other players, and the outcome of such attack is determined in a semi-random fashion. First couple of turns crucial, and it seemed harder to come back from a bad move in Citta than it did in T&E. I liked the picking of actions, maybe there should be a way to guarantee that those 'boost farming' cards won't clog up the line? Would like to play with "advanced" setup.

RATING: 9
Tight resource-management where players are attempting to build the best civilization (cities).  Should you go for quantity or quality?  It's sometimes tough to decide how strong you should be influence-wise (Will of the People); the mechanic which sucks your opponent's townspeople into your city, destroying their unpopulated buildings. You'll need enough food from harvesting to feed all of your citizens (and any new ones) otherwise you'll pay a strong penalty.  This one definitely hits the sweet spot.

Városokat hozunk létre különböző épületekből. Az épületek egy része növeli a város befolyását 3 különböző kategória valamelyikében. Minden kör végén kihirdetjük a nép akaratát, vagyis eldől, hogy az adott körben melyik kategória a legfontosabb a háromból. Ezután minden olyan város lakosokat szipkáz el a szomszédaitól, ami ebben a kategóriában erősebb a környező településeknél. A játék végén a győzelmi pontok legnagyobb része a lakosok számából adódik.
Egyike azon játékoknak, ahol az élelmezés az egyik legfontosabb kérdés. A vicces az, hogy itt folyamatosan változik az ellátandó polgárok száma, minden körben egy csomó dolog történik, ami miatt majd elvándorolnak, vagy érkeznek lakosok, így nem győzöd újra és újra azt számolgatni, hogy na most akkor hány embert is kell majd megetetnem a kör végén? Persze sokszor mire kialakul a végleges szám, már késő cselekedni ...
Negatívum, hogy mivel minden játékos ugyanolyan figurákat használ, a  városok összefolynak, nehéz átlátni a táblát.

RATING: 8
Players to attempt to build cities which will be influential enough to attract people from competing player cities, thus allowing them to end with the most people of any player.  The board is randomly created, and then players must place cities so that they are able to get food, gold, and access water (all of which are required to expand the cities and build other things that make the city desirable to people).  The game is very competitive, as players will necessarily end up trying to steal people from other players' cities.  Cities compete for people based on one of three types of desirable characteristics (obtained by building specific buildings), and it's only partially known which characteristic will be used in each turn to determine which city is the most desirable.

Overall this is an enjoyable, thought requiring game, but I wish that there were more mechanisms to allow large buildings to be built (as large buildings require specific cards to be built, and the cards available often stagnate because players that I play with often don't choose cards, meaning that there is at most 1 useful building card available).

This is a good game, but not a great game.  Quite a lot to consider while playing, and the copy I have did not help: it's often challenging to discern between the types of city tiles, the dark blue people pieces are nearly the same color as the generic people pieces.  It's easy to have a city in a bad position, but difficult if not impossible to bring it back to life again.  If you're down, it becomes challenging to come back.  All in all, not bad, but won't be played again in the near future.

RATING: 3
This is a very interesting game that probably could have been a classic had it been tightened up a little. Players are challenged to balance a number of factors as they start and expand cities. If you make your city attractive, you'll steal population (which double as VPs) from other players, but if you don't have enough food to feed your new residents, you get burned. Furthermore, you're making bets on what "the people" want; bet wrong and you'll be the one sending people to others' cities. Resource management, spatial placement, and timing all come into play.

However, I can see where the complaints about this title are coming from. Your actions are largely constrained by the cards available in the card display, which got clogged in our game (and apparently many others) by unappealing cards that never get removed. This results in the face down cards having more perceived value than anything that's available, so players don't want to use weak cards for fear that an awesome card will get revealed for the next player, further clogging the card display. This also gives a slight advantage to the start player, who will probably have a display full of decent cards to pick from.

In addition, the game feels like it runs just a little too long. Turns feel redundant, especially as actions become extremely constrained toward the end. Whatever arc there is to the game could probably have been condensed into something closer to an hour, perhaps by more aggressively changing the board per player and chopping a couple rounds off.

In the end, this feels like a game with great potential but misses the mark. I might increase my rating with some tweaks, like [thread=340181]flushing the action cards[/thread] and/or chopping a round off the game. Even more interesting might be a card drafting variant, by which players start the game by selecting cards from the deck that they will play over the course of the game, but that's probably getting a little crazy.

I'm not sure what I think of this one after one play.  I like how your "island" grows or shrinks depending on how you can influnce other citizens to your city.  But you need to always keep the farms and citizens in check, other wise you'll starve them and not only loose them but your 1 or your 5 actions in the next round.

La Città is difficult to judge. On one hand, there are civilization aspects that I like, such as the constant struggle for food, money and development, and I like how the rule that people move to cities where "the grass is greener" creates tension between the players. On the other hand, those very restrictions sometimes makes you feel that the game plays you, leaving little room for creative strategies. Perhaps the essence of the game is the small subtle decisions but in that case I need to play more to understand them.

Update: Sold because I felt that the People's Voice was too unpredictable to reward strategic play and the remaining decisions are simply not enough to warrant such a long game.

This is one of those great games that is just filled with tension the entire time.  You must manage so many different things with such a limited range of actions, that any sort of success feels like a real triumph.  I am ashamed to say that I almost traded this one away, but I'm glad I kept it around.

I have only played with 3 players, which seems like an ideal number, so I'm a little concerned about what might happen with 4 or 5.  It also seemed that certain political cards clogged the face up cards, sometimes making it impossible to really do much in a turn.  Still, this is a very enjoyable game, and definitely deserves the reprint it is getting.

Fantastic game.  Intimidating, but mechanics are actually quite simple.  Similar to settlers in the fact that you build settlements and specific buildings to collect resources.  Different in that you have to manage food production, and the movement of people, which is determined by who has the most developed cities in a particular area.  Was going to probably sell my sealed copy, but after this, I'm opening it.  I know a lot of people want to get it but don't believe the hype, it is quite a good game if you like city development, and aggressiveness in a game.  Reccomended!  Go reprint!

Ruthless heavyweight game that can easily feel like a constant losing battle no matter what you do, especially with the cramped quarters when five people play.  Wanting to do more stuff than you can legally do is generally considered a good game quality, but in this case it's escalated to a needlessly frustrating degree and you can rarely do what you need to do the most.  Game still has merit, though;  don't want to sound like a crybaby.

This game has some incredible simple and enjoyable mechanics in it.  I really liked the game, but I found that once a player has a leg up on someone else, it is difficult for the other person to recover.  Still, though, I enjoyed the game and would really like to play it a couple of more times to see if my conclusion of the game is still accurate.  This is a fun "builder" game.

Confirmed, once you start losing out on a city, very difficult to hold your ground.  Not adviseable for 2 player play.  3-4 is much more fun.  Not a bad game at all.

I made some horrible errors in my first play and still managed a respectable finish - I look forward to many more games of this classic. If I had to complain about something, it would certainly be the fiddliness of the citizens and the way they cover the already-hard-to-see arches on the tiles that are crucial to your success. I can see the rating going up with subsequent plays.

Rather arduous, fascinating civ-like game that seems innocuous at first. But cities automatically grow in population size, and so if you obey the eurogaming 101 dictum to expand your footprint at the first opportunity (see Catan), soon you'll be overwhelmed by the size of your empire, sucked into a death spiral.

Down time is KILLER.  Game is quite stressful, which is good, but the main problem is that you can fall behind very easily (just even with bad luck) and you are out of the game.  Not much to do if that happens other than hope people finish their turns quickly.  Game needs some fixing in my opinion.

Started with cities on opposite sides of the board. With little conflict, I didn't have to worry about losing citizens much. I was able to get three 4x wheat fields in one city. Won the game by a little bit. It seems that avoiding conflict is a good strategy when you are on the board edges.

RATING: 6.5
Brutal, unforgiving, painful. A very solid game, but one that punishes you for falling behind, which often creates a runaway leader. Every move has to be planned perfectly or everything can be lost within a couple of poorly played turns. Not a game I can play often.

What it could be otherwise a good game is IMHO ruined by 3 issues: the board/tiles are not functional (I had a very hard time trying to read the information from the board) + a very hard planning, which success depends all and all on the colour of 3 random cards + too long gameplay.

RATING: 7
A fascinating way to tie in area majority control with geometrical control, and my rating might well increase after a few plays.

Daft colour scheme doesn't really help, but the little men are a delightful addition and there is almost a card-game-like quality in the way the distribution of the politics cards decides the pace of the game. As has since become a commonplace idea, having not enough actions to do everything leads to some agonising decisions.

The starting position of the 3-food tile needs house-ruling to prevent blowouts. Especially in 3P.

The board is hopeless for colourblind players - there's an entire section that I can't see. Otherwise the components are OK but dull.
La Citta doesn't really work for me. I like the way "the people's" desires are determined, but the constrained map is bizarre. The whole thing feels very "gamey", an abstract with glued-on theme. Normally I don't mind that, but here it gets in the way.
Unlikely to bother with this again.

First play was quite a mammoth game. 5 players took 3 hours!! To be fair though there was only 1 person who had played before, and that was quite some time ago. The game itself is my kind of game.

The game takes awhile, but it is worth it. Several of the special actions cards get "stale" and hang around for a long time. "Guessing" which color is going to be scored and making sure you can feed all your citizens is crucial to a winning strategy.

I played this on a recent trip back to the UK while at Nick Fisk's (moviebuff) shop in Hanley, Shire Games. I liked it and didn't feel like waiting for an English reprint so I just bought the german version and Nick supplied the English rules and player aids!

The theme is reminiscent of Settlers in that players are trying to build up multiple cities while competing positionally for resources. That said, the mechanics and player interactions are completely different since instead of competing purely for  resources you're also attempting to improve your city so that the population from surrounding cities will want to move to yours. 

All in all a really fun game that my usual gaming group seem to be enjoying a lot as well so I think this will become a regular.

This is a good game. Your cities are always growing citizens, so you build new farms and buildings to feed 'em and entertain 'em. If you have more entertainment than other players' nearby cities, you steal their citizens. But this is only good if you can feed them with farms, which you may not have enough of if you've been building entertainment. Lots of good stuff to play with.

The downside is that it's hard to pull back once your on the slippery slope of despair, but there are interesting decisions, it plays well for 2 to 5 players (well, maybe 4 players) and the random setup creates a tense beginning and different challenges each game. We play the variant where we wipe all cards each round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Neat game. I like the theme and art. Too long for what it is, but I enjoy it. Perhaps a couple tweaks could make this a shorter and better game.

The 2000 English edition needs a reprint with a slight graphics rethink, and slightly bigger hexes. Yellow player's Castle hexes blend in too much with building hexes. People's wish cards could use more clarification of association to the colored arches on the hexes. I cannot speak for the later or other language editions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Pretty good civ-lite area-control game.  Be sure to use the variant that the last political card is discarded each turn and the rest moved down before flipping new ones.  This helps keep the political cards from clogging up so much.  Math traded.

First game was 4 hours loooooong using German edition with no English language paste-ups on very language dependent cards. Add in a horrible, and inconsiderate teacher.

I didn't play it again for about 4 more years.

2nd play was on English language version with very good teacher and only took about 2-2.5 hours. A much better experience. I just don't know if I really want to repeat it or not. We played with 5 and it was a little tight. I see that several geek buddies recommend it more with 4P. That might be better to alleviate some of the tightness on the board and speed it up to a more tolerable experience.

It just overall felt kind of mathy, and you're constantly doing a balancing act.

A very intriguing game, but the recommended 3-player setup has an issue.  The first person to play has immense advantage in getting the double-quarry spaces.  One person can oppose that person, leaving the other person free to do other things (much like a 3-player war game).  Otherwise, a very interesting flow of mechanics that makes for a very clever and deep game.

Played a second game with 2 players.  Game was very tight as no one was taking any risks.  In my first game my opponent took a risk by creating a city too close to me and it was never able to grow without getting crushed by its bigger neighbors.

Doesn't get played much because there are so many other games to play.

Played a game to relearn the rules.  Played solo but with 3 sides.  Lots of fun but really loooong.  Blue tried to start a 3rd city in the first round to capitalize on the mines in the south east of the board.  Unfortunately, blue was never able to grow his cities significantly.  It was really a battle between red and yellow.

Really a beautiful game.  Rules not that complex but it's not easy to make the right decisions...

Feels a lot like Sim City - 3 demand areas that each citizen wants.  Unlike Sim City though, these citizens are fickle, and want each one at different times.  It's important to do well in all three, since you'll need them all at some point, but each one has a certain time where it's more important.  City development brings some enjoyable decisions; should I get another city and more citizens, or just focus on the ones I have?  More players serve to make the competition a little more fierce, as players are forced to balance immigration a little more precisely to ensure adequate food sources.  A fun game that is prone to some Analysis Paralysis if you don't keep on top of slow people.

RATING: 7.3
1st play of this game with 4 players took 4 hours(!).  Quite a lot of AP, but I don't mind this too much.  The biggest flaw we found with this game is the random politics cards.  Some people would get a lucky one, whilst other unwanted ones sat and accumulated over time.  

I think if we play this again, we'll try a house variant to counter this.  Some possibilities are that at the end of a year, any duplicate politic cards are removed and replaced with a fresh draw.  -or-  Possibly limiting the deck to only having 2 of each type of card (a lot of reshuffles, but more guaranteed variety).

There were a few faults with some of the design choices, such as the market place blends in too much with other tiles meaning that players often forget they don't have one (this happened several times).

Despite the problems, I enjoyed the game and I'd definitely play it again.

Unfortunately, I found that the effort in thinking out your actions is undermined by the only 2 chaotic subsystems: the speculative nature of the Voice of the People and the order and sometimes lockup of the Political cards. Coupled with the fiddly counting of citizens and comparing the coloured arches makes the game a bit of chore, despite the tension involved.

I like this game a lot. Somewhat fussy and fiddly, having to keep track of the maximum allowed population of each city , but it is worth it. Lots of strategy and preplanning involved. Very nice theme and neat mechanism for growing the population of your cities by attracting people from other player's cities. One of my all-time favorites.

This game is TOO unforgiving. Like Settlers of Catan, it suffers from the problem that an early mistake or poor luck can cripple a player for the rest of the game, relegating them to a distraction and source of citizens for other players. What compounds this problem is that the game is easily 2 hours long.

And the card luck is significant in La Citta. The Voice of the People can have a tremendous impact on two rival players, making the difference in direction of a 1-citizen swap (so +1 instead of -1, which is significant), and the available action cards are a source of irksome randomness as well. I do enjoy the theme and feeling of building up city states, but the game is too broken and luck-based to make it something I would regularly want to play.

The game is far too long and complex for the small payout. Worse...your strategy can be destroyed by the Voice of the People cards. The randomness kills this game.

Played one 5 player game, and liked the game with some reservations:

1. It's hard to see the icons for health, culture, and education icons on the building tiles, which makes it hard to quickly evaluate your situation. 

2. I experienced a LOT of AP in this game. It was so bad that I actually considered pulling the fire alarm just to end the damn game. 

I'd play this one again, but I'd probably want a timer to limit turns to 2-3 minutes.

A really good gamers' game.  It can be tough to play with lots of difficult choices to make.

Essentially a development game with a strong resource balancing act to manage.  Other players and a bit of chance conspire to make it a tough game to play.

A good amount of direct conflict, much more than would be expected from a civilization growth game. Good balance between trying to grow the cities for VPs and collecting citizens - which you have to invest in farms which don't score for you. 

Think the board is to crowded with 5 players so 4 or 2 is the sweet spot. 
The game is gradual so you can't fall too far behind because the strong cities will get stronger, and will be hard to reign in the leaders.

One great game. The game is superb, the rules are easy and well explained and there is a lot of player interactions, specialy at the end of the game. It's a solid management game with a slight wargame side. One of the best game out there that unfortunatly doesn't get played enough.

Super jeu. Le matériel est superbe, les règles sont simples et bien expliquées et il y a beaucoup d'interactions entre les joueurs. C'est un solide jeu de gestion avec un petit côté jeu de guerre. Un des très bon jeu qui n'est malheureusement pas assez joué.

The game is actually less complicated than it looks and despite some fiddly stuff and not very elegant design (not the mechanics but the upkeep of available food, population limit etc.). I like that there are really not a lot of victory conditions like in many other games and even though there are always quite a few choices to be made, the focus never derails and the goal is clear. I wish the game would have more streamlined and you make a lot of mistakes just because there are so many things to keep track of and the game does not help you in doing it. The game is confrontational without being vicious because if you steal people, you have to feed them after all. Maybe it could have done with a bit more card variety and randomness, but that would probably made it much less of a euro.

November 2015: Down from 7 to 6.

Well-designed, elegant city building game. Very good strategic decisions: Do I start a third city? Which cities should I build up, and when? Turns move fast too.

Unfortunately, not that much fun. Although it's very confrontational, the interaction is limited, in the form of blocking and stealing citizens from players. Yes, the interaction is very significant, it just happens too infrequently.

Also, the tactical puzzles the game offers aren't that very interesting.

May 2007 (I think): Played this once two player and once five player. Preferred the five player version since it is very interactive and confrontational!

Very strategic: You only have thirty turns in the game. Very thematic as well; my gaming group has compared this game to Civilization (the computer game).

The biggest fault with this game is the length of time it takes to play it.

RATING: 6.7
Difficult game - played with 5 players, and I'm not sure it's very good at that point, for a flaw I probably need two paragraphs to explain.  But it was challenging and provided a large number of choices, player interaction, and some luck.  I think it would play a lot better with 3, maybe 4 players, but I'd be willing to try it again with 5.  Another problem is a 5-player game took almost 4 hours, and I'm sure I'd rather play two or three other games than one of this. Update: played it with 4 players, taking 4.5 hours, and reduced my rating from 7 to 6.7. The flaw is that someone who gets crunched early through pure bad luck is essentially stuck in a frustrating no-hope situation for the rest of the game and doesn't have any fun. It wasn't me this time, it was someone else, but that doesn't affect my opinion of the game.

La Citta is beautiful and the mechanic of moving citizens from one city to another city that has better services is unique.  The common pool of politics cards creates a lot of tension by forcing me to wait until the other players pick actions to get to pick my own. 

La Citta's rules are fairly easy to learn for a civilization style game. I would say it plays pretty well with two people too.  The board is set up so that it scales well depending on the number of players.

It also has a lot of conflict and player interaction for a no battle Euro game.  Because each player is aiming to steal the citizens from their opponents' less successful cities, the conflict is very direct.  It surprises me that I like La Citta as much as I do because in most cases, the more direct the conflict, the more I dislike a game, but there is something fantastic about the delight of building up a city that cuts through my usual dislike of conflict.  It's fun to build sectors of the city near the food and the mountains that are the "working class" part of the city, while placing the public baths and statues and universities in a prettier area next to a lake.  (Okay, I guess that is just my peculiar fancy.)

Many interesting things going on in this game. The game needs some type of accounting mechanism (scoreboard, white board, piece of paper, ...) to handle the # of citizens and the amount of grain you have which you seem to recount many, many times during the game.  A little bit long for what the game does.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very solid euro of the economic-development kind. It has a low level of player interaction (but is not multi-player solitaire) and a nice development arc. It feels about medium-weight to me (needs more brainpower than Ticket to Ride but less than Tikal or Age of Steam) but there may be depths I don't appreciate yet. The production quality is good, and the artwork is beautiful, detailed, and amazingly varied.

I usually avoid fractional ratings, or else I might give this a 7.5: it's better than many games I rate a 7, but seems to lack the spark that would make me give it an 8. There is tension, but it isn't unremitting; sometimes your best move is obvious. Also, it always helps a game to have a cool and memorable  "signature" mechanism, but La Città falls a bit short. I suppose its signature is the emigration of citizens (and therefore victory points) to the most attractive cities, and that's cool but not quite enough to make it stand out from other games of this kind. Yet La Città does have its own personality, and really is a good example of the genre.

If you like euros, you will probably greatly enjoy La Città.

Well integrated with its theme -- with limited resources you build a city, develop education, culture and public works, feed your people and expand; or find your population is leaving for neighboring cities (an interesting alternative to combat).

Excellent heavy euro game with lots to think about and more outright conflict than most euros.  Count on one learning game to get your head around it  and rather long playing times, but there's enough meat on it to warrant the duration. Does have a bit of a runaway leader problem.

RATING: 6
Not only can players hurt one another's positions, doing so actually directly benefits them.

In many euros, you can hinder another player's access to resources, but, unless you're after those resources, yourself, you're sort of "falling on your sword" to inconvenience someone else. This can create situations where only those not involved in the conflict benefit.

This does not apply to La Citta, which the two resources over which you're fighting, food and population, both always help you and further your own goals.

Was looking for a nice game that plays at about 30 minutes per player and offers competition and choice when it is a players turn and La Citta certainly fits that bill.  Starts slowly as the cities are small but as they grow and start to interact more, the civilians nicely move from city to city adding another dynamic to the game as it continues.  Always a hard choice between getting more food and expanding a city.  Even a gentle take-that mechanic where one can steal citizens, or send them away to other cities that can't feed them tweaking that player a bit.

Interesting mechanics of managing city growth and migration of people to the more attractive cities, but in end the game kind of falls flat for me.  It just seems like an old Euro in feel, particularly in that points are only scored at the end - more modern games usually allow for scoring mid-game to make it more interesting, and to avoid having end scores very close.  Also, the game really needs ways to better track things: each player should have a player board, both to place your 5 cards per year as you take your turns (not a huge necessity), and with a population and food tracker (very necessary), so you aren't constantly adding up your population.  And it needs a more visual method for showing how many arches of each color each city has - it's too easy to miss an arch when you're scanning the board.

It's taken a couple of games and I'm finally beginning to get the hang of it. Lots of choices and planning keeps you engaged even when it isn't your turn. There's a lot of counting involved each turn - more so than even Liberte. Frustration when the right card doesn't come out leaves you reaching out for alternative plans. Player interaction is a factor - don't want my people to leave town now. It must be near impossible to achieve the perfect game and therein lies a worthy challenge. I rate it just that little bit higher because it plays so well through the entire range of 2-5 players.

Perhaps a 5 is a disservice, as this game has many elements that appeal to me and feels unique in some ways. But my reservations are 1. It's harsh, and early mistakes can give you a real mountain to climb in recovery. 2. This is my major beef - it's badly designed in terms of the aesthetics, so much so that trying to get past the incongruity of it all hampers gameplay. Admittedly I'm not hugely into lengthy games and if I was, I might be more forgiving. But our group abandoned it after round four, having decided 2 hours was enough. Traded!

A great game, but not for everyone. Gets better with every play. There's great tension, since you want to do so much more in a turn than is possible. Some people hate that, but the tension is the whole point of the fun! People who suck at it, end up hating it. Play it with a group who love games with some depth and richness. The production value is also top-notch. Plays great with two players as well, and the game is usually closer. The more cities on the board, the harder it might be too catch up if you're losing citizens left and right. Grossly underated, and deserves more attention than it gets.

[4 plays] 4 player games and one 2 player game. I really, really enjoy this game. It is the 2 hour civilization building game for which I've been searching for years. I am tempted to rate this a 10, but I'll wait for a few more plays. I'll post lots more comments soon.

Update: Had a tough game on the last play. I ended up in the middle of everyone with the predetermined set-up, then played pretty poorly given that circumstance. Could have gone more conservative and really developed one powerhouse city, but that would have been a safe strategy for 2nd place, not a pursuit of victory. So I rapidly got squeezed and ended up in death spiral. I'll try not to judge it too harshly for that, and give my next play an open mind.

Works...

Seems like a bit of a brain burner for my liking... We'll see.

UPDATE:

Have had a couple of trial rules run-through and gave up about half way through both... just a bit bored with the game-play. Really not going to be one for wifey, so will be looking to sell/donate in the new year.

2nd Update:

This is a favorite of mine and Grandpa's, but nobody else in the house likes it. Lots of tough decisions throughout and the resource and obligation juggling throughout the game really keep you on your toes.  <BR><BR>There are a couple of rules that are easy to miss on first reading, but the bits are excellent and the the rulebook is first rate. <BR><BR>The only fault that I find with the game is the persistence of Politics cards from one round to the next.  We tend to go with some house rules and generally decide ahead of time whether we will swap out one, all or none of the Politics cards at the end of each year.  This makes the game very tight or very loose, depending upon the card swap.<BR><BR>Beautiful layout when the game is in progress.  A great game!

Jó nagy táblával rendelkező eléggé egyedi játék. A játékosok városaikat építik, különböző épületeket felhúzva, amelyek egy-egy embert követelnek meg, akik azokat működtetik. 3 fajta befolyást növelhetnek az épületek a termelőkön kívül, amivel a szomszédos közeli ellenfelek városaiból lehet lakosságot átcsábítani. Az embereinket búzatermelő épületekkel kell ellátni élelemmel és fontos, hogy legyen némi pénzünk is, amit bányákkal tudunk növelni. Ehhez jön még pár érdekes lapfajta, amivel különböző nagyobb épületeket és tevékenységeket tudunk végezni. Jó játékról van szó, egyedül talán az átláthatatlanságát lehet felhozni negatívumnak a sok megegyező színű lakos miatt, de mindenképpen kipróbálásra érdemes darab.

Man what a fun game.  This creates some grand suspense as the cards are revealed and people start moving around.  There are so many options here, but nothing is overwhelming. 
 
The great thing about the system is the balance between all the different ways to get ahead, every option available is going to help you somehow, even though most all of your moves force you to reevaluate the permutations in your strategy.  

I love the neccesity to balance between tactics and strategy.  

Sometimes the best moves are bucking the system.  I love sending people over to cities that won't be able to feed them.  

Brilliant!

After many plays this one goes up to a 10.

Rate an 8.5 after one play.  I really like this type of "Civ" game (kind of reminds me of a lighter version of Antiquity).  From my first game's experience, however, I believe you must really love La Citta's type of game mechanics (have to juggle many competing priorities - food to avoid starvation/quarries to gain wealth, building for victory conditions/building to avoid losing population to stronger neighbors/building to steal population from neighbors) and enjoy the tension that builds with the inevitable player conflict to have an enjoyable experience.  In this particular case two of the four players didn't much care for the game and it took much longer than anticipated to complete.

If the "accounting" parts of the game were smoother, it would work better.  We found ourselves frequently asking "Okay, on turn two, did I get paid for xxx?"  This is the kind of game that would benefit from being played on a computer where the little things were all handled for you.

I love all the bits, and I enjoy the mechanics and migration interaction between the cities.  Unfortunately, there's not enough interesting decisions and actions during the game, and so the game is simply long for what it is.  If they somehow could get the game to be played in about half the time, it would be much better.  I understand that the length of the game demands some long-range planning, which adds to the experience, but the quality of the gameplay does not merit the time spent with the extra length.  Nevertheless, this is one I could enjoy playing on occasion.

Big-box game that disappointed me, although the potential is great. I have serious issues with how at least one player will always be screwed after only a couple of turns. It sucks having to play one more hour (or more) with the certainty you're going to end dead last. This may be the player's fault, but the game makes sure that there will always be at least one such player.
In addition to that, there is a big difference between the power of the various cards. Some are always good, others are always (nearly) useless. If you get stuck with useless cards, you have to waste a turn with a bad card. Picking that card will usually reveal a good card for the next player. Cursing your luck is the only answer there, I'm afraid. For a game of this lenth and depth, I think that's a pretty bad feature.
All in all, not a game I would like to play again.

Ugly gameplay. Something about the combination and design of action cards, buildings, placement, and lack of suspense is really dull. Deciding what to do with your too few actions is nothing but a snooze as invariably your choices become horribly obvious.  Awful, awful game that I am glad to be rid of.  This one is a lesson to me not to buy games before I have read the rules.

Decent "civ" game with a variable starting map and interesting mechanisms. People will leave your city and go to a neighboring city if you don't meet their demands and needs. Action selection is through cards in your hand and a public deck which keeps the game tight and tense. A few finicky rules and a poor rule booklet make this game seem much more complicated than it is and a single play-through will take care of many of your questions.

I haven't played it forever, and then only with 2 players, but I remember really enjoying La Citta. 
Update: Upon replaying, it's just as tense and enjoyable two-player game as I remember. I think the scaling playing field does a great job of making sure things are tight even with only a couple of players. It's really impressive the sense of wanting to do so many things wih your limited actions per turn. This was one of the first Euros I bought a long time ago and I'm very pleased it holds up so well after years and playing a lot of newer games.

After more plays with up to 4 people, this still holds up. As long as players don't get stuck over-pondering their options it still moves along quickly. A bonus that everyone who plays it seems to really dig it.

update: However, do not play with 5! too long. Otherwise, an enjoyable game.

Good theme play for a euro.  Easy to learn and play; however, it takes a few plays to pick-up the subtle nuances and strategies.  Game play can be tense, offers many choices, and has very good player interaction for a euro.  Game has a simple scoring system and scales very well.  Components are very good - colorful mounted board, ceramic citizen pieces, thick cardboard chits, durable small size cards.  Rulebook is good too, although could have been organized slightly better.  Player colors are not standard which is a minor niggle.  Game length is perfect, running about 90 minutes.  Rapidly becoming one of my favorites!

RATING: 7
[Kosmos 2000 edition] {Italy, civilization; tile-laying, resource management; optimal 4-5p} La Città is a solid and attractive strategy Euro game. It provides both tactical options and strategic planning with low luck. Players compete to have the largest population and finest cities in the region. It's fun, thematic and is full of interactions. It's multifaceted because players have several ways to increase the population of their cities.

Players have to plan carefully so that they can maintain the resources (food and gold) effectively and keep the growth of city and growth of population steady. Frequently, players may find that they can't expand a city due to limited population. Voice of people is growing important at the late game because migration of citizen is one crucial way to increase the population of a city. It is occasionally exciting to reveal the voice of people because it may force a player to over-populate.

In all, La Città is a good game for gamers. General gamers may find it's too deep for playing.

A good game, but long for what it is, with just enough downtime to make it frustrating, if you have players who feel they must analyze and re-analyze (and there is good reason to do so). It suffers the same problem I have with Power Grid, in that if you are not very careful and take the time to maximize each move, you will probably lose the game, but if you do take the time to maximize each move the game moves at a snail's pace. Thus, in a way, it rewards players whose over-attention to details frustrates everyone else.

Second play after 8 years (!) and i really don`t understand why my rating was 8.

The game feels like a gamers game, is long, but extemly random. You are figting for majority, but you don`t know in what colour. he card that let you see some voice of the people cards (their decide in what colour we will check the majority) is crutial. But the`re only few of this cards (that let you see the voice of the people). If you fall behind, you will be eaten. The problem is, it could be not you fold. And you can`t build what you want. You need the right cards. So there`s another moment where you need luck. You need to much luck.

This is a somewhat brutal game that causes players to fight against the system just to survive.  However, once certain problems are taken care of, the players can focus on improving their cities.  Competition with the other players becomes very tight midway through the game, and if one megacity is allowed to get rolling, it will be hard to do anything about it later on.  This is a nice, tight competitive game.

Too much luck (at least for me) with Voice of the People cards and also with available Politics-cards. There's also a serious runaway leader problem. When one city grows (maybe by accidently matching the wishes of the VotP-cards), there's no stopping it and all surrounding cities will perish.

RATING: 7.4
I really enjoyed this game, despite its flaws. It's a bit fiddly to score, but not too bad if you're careful. Less forgiveable is that the random politics cards came out really badly in our first round, leaving none that were worth picking at all. This caused the selection of cards to become somewhat stale right from the outset. While I'm more than happy to give the game another chance, perhaps utilising a variant to ameliorate the issues, others in our group have been turned off the game entirely by this problem. That's a real shame, as it seems unlikely now that it will ever see the table again.

I'm willing to admit that, after only a single game, we might not have understood the cards well enough to declare them truly useless. But after a long discussion on the forum, no-one's managed to convince me that this is the case, and I can't help but see this as a disappointing flaw in an otherwise rather excellent game.

I like this game, but I think it is a flawed design.  The card rules make it very luck-dependent; if it's your turn and you take a card, you may have just given the next person what you wanted.  I've played with a forced-rotation rule, which I liked better, but it still doesn't quite satisfy my feeling that it should be a little cleaner.

The winner does seem to be the player who played the best, though again, the cards play a HUGE role in determining what you can do on any given turn.

Played twice 3 player. This is a very unforgiving game and can be fairly unbalanced in terms of start options.

Seems like a case of the rich get richer and it is tough to knock down a player even if trying to "gang" up on him. Not sure of the replayability of the game despite the multiple start positions, but I'm enjoying it for now.

I suffered from some serious AP a couple times during my play of this. I found myself constantly recounting my positions.

I think the game could be considerably improved if the population units had the player's color (instead of gray) and if there were separate tracks to show population and food. Then I could quickly determine if I could steal population from my neighbor without penalty.

Otherwise, it was a good game with nice elements and mechanics.

RATING: 7.5
I like this game.  It shows it's age in that it is less snappy than newer designs, but that is not a problem for me.  I really enjoy city/civ building games if they are not too detailed so this hits me just right. Plus it is beautiful to look at.

The tableau can get stuck, but houserules or variants found here easily fix this to your specs.

If not for the long playtime I would play this more. It is a great lazy Sunday game.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 1

This is a fantastic game!  I've only played once, but now I definitely can't wait for the reprint.  It epitomizes those kinds of games where you never have enough turns to do everything you want to do.  There are countless difficult decisions to make during this game about which actions of the many you want to take are actually the most important.  There are many different buildings you can add to your cities and different directions you can expand, but not nearly enough time to do it all.

the type of game that almost needs 2 ratings from me. On the one hand, this feels (after 1 play) like an excellent game--very interesting, great mechanics, super player interaction, unique feel and unique bits. I recognize that in terms of game quality, this rates up there. On the other hand, I recognize that it is not my type of game...not sure how to describe it yet other than aggressive in the way that I don't like aggressive. Or maybe a mix of aggression and shortage that rubs me the wrong way. Not a game, in other words, that will rate high on my desire to replay.

Based on my plays when it was first released, I remembered this game being fun, but long and a dry. Now that I played it again after all those years, I really regret having sold it. I love that players are at each others throats from turn two onwards - something that is quite rare in todays boardgames, especially in the family game category. And the turn angst made the playing time feel very reasonable. Got to get this game back.

A very strategic game. The concept of sphere of influence that attracts or drains your opponents resource is new to me. Poor planning leads to constant drain on own cities while profiting opponent. This is a game where not only do you need to push to develop, but defending is quite important since it can constantly provide victory points for the opponent.

I really wish I had paid attention to the time when I started this game.  This is supposed to be a fairly long game, but it sure didn't feel like it.  It felt like it took about an hour, but I there's no way that the game was that fast.

Obviously I enjoyed my single play of the game.  You start out easy; the first turn doesn't seem to be likely to have alot of conflict unless you are really trying to get into someone's face.  After that, cities start to encrouch on each other and you have basics in place to start some competition.  The game gets tighter and tighter as it progresses.  You won't have enough of anything and if you do, it probably won't be true for long.

It's funny that my impression of the game seems to directly contradict some other people's complaints about the game.  I did not find it even slightly dry or overly complicated, altough I'm sure it helped that I had experianced players handling the rules.  There is certainly alot of calculation involved, and the penalty for mistakes can be high, so I can understand those objections.

La Citta reminds me that when we rate games after only a play or two we can never seperate the game itself from our total experience, even though that experience is affected by so much more than the game. How the game is taught, the environment we are playing in and the group we are playing with all contribute to the feeling: "I want to play / I don't want to play again." On my first play of La Citta I did not enjoy it all. Was it the game or the "game experience" that left me so miserable? The argument that its not the game itself includes: Learning was difficult and took over an hour  before a single move was made. German cards without paste-ups made the first two years slow as each player asked again and again for clarification.

We were at the game for four hours total. With only 30 decision points per player (5 plays by 6 years) and few of them actually not-obvious (e.g. it is not a hard choice to build farms early before there is less space for it) it was about 10 minutes of downtime per meaningful choice at best. And unlike other long games, it felt as if most decisions were reactive. It is odd to say this about a game that has a weigth on bgg of 3 , but to me, it actually felt much lighter than other games this long. And if I am going to sit down with one game for 3  (or 4 !) hours I want the heavy-game feeling. 

On this isuue of "long-ness": not every long game feels long. But (again, perhaps because of the tough start we had) La Citta felt long, tedious, robotic. Each choice I made seemed to be a simple crunching of numbers: "how many black vs. white vs. blue? If this, then this. again, again." By the 4th year I was looking wistfully at the games being played around me. By the 5th and 6th year I had lost almost all interest in doing the number crunching of counting the arches next to my cities.

As I think about the exquisite anguish in a game like Clippers or Caylus-- the agony you feel as an opponant selects something you really wanted and you cry out, "Noooooo! Do anything but that!" I think that this quality-- the quality of caring so much you viscerally emote-- is something that is wholly missing in La Citta. It mattered little what my opponant did. They did it, and the next player reacted and so on. And to add a little insult to the whole injury, for a game this long there sure was a lot of randomness! The wide variation in effect of cards that can be drawn (for example the 3 white arches for 3 gold and its ilk) and the way in which the open cards start to stagnate and all the bad cards no one wants take up all the space, means that as soon as a single good card is flipped, the spoils flow to whoever is next in turn order.

I am willing to try it again. But in a way it reminded me of Tyros. A few nice things that just added up to a whole lot of not enough fun for a very long time.

A sumptious city development game with a focus on balance and citizen support. I was very impressed with the sheer number of options. No turn felt exactly the same. Whether this is a good thing depends what sort of gamer you are. I enjoyed it but I could see why someone wouldn't. I was overwhelmed but in a good way. Kosmos, dependable as ever, delivers a very attractive looking game with solid components.

(One play) I enjoyed this game, but it was really brain hurting trying to keep track of all the numbers of citizens on top of all the arches in each city, the citizen limits, etc. I really like the idea of poaching citizens. The length of the game keeps the rating from going higher.

A very complex and competitive game that uses a massive board and many game mechanics. Very creative theme and set up especially with the fact that every "year" people in your city can just move to your opponents city, so its a constant battle over people. Probably wouldn't recommend it as the first game if you've never played these kinds of games before, but La Citta is great entertainment where in the end you have no idea who will win.

RATING: 8
Not as Euro as you would expect from a game called "The City" in Italian.  This one has some nice player conflict that separates it from the rest.  Components are beautiful, particularly the little plastic guys who come in two genders, a nice touch that is almost impossible to see unless you look at them very closely.  Gameplay is interesting, almost reminiscent of the military race in [gameid=25613], where you are trying to build up your economic engine, but you have to make sure that you defend yourself well enough, and also take the time to attack opponents effectively when they don't do the same.  The biggest drawback is that this game needs some kind of house rule to flush out the unused action cards.  I like using [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/2568/la-cittatxt]Joe Casadonte's variant[/url].

RATING: N/A
Strategy game, with some luck and a lot of planning. Scales well. Nice bits.
Its flaws are:
I) the cards aren't balanced and so sometimes you buy a card and the card that is revealed to replace it (and thus is avaible for your opponent) is much better than all the 7 you had available.
II) the "Voice of the People" is utterly random. Once in a while you can mitigate it with a "Polling the People", even if there's nothing worse than a Poll (not paying the extra 2$) revealing 3 different cards... and I'm inclined to believe that 2$ and an action is a bit overpriced for the full effect, especially since the other players can simply "copy" your next moves. Bluffing won't help unless you're the last player and can thus do some "surprise" action in the last turn; but if you go last will all the other players ignore that "Polling the People"?
III) the "3 food" tile is overpowered. If it comes near a "2 food" tile, whoever goes first during the setup has got a great advantage with no drawback. This is very bad for a "strategy game".
IV) once a city is "doomed" (at least two neighbouring cities "stronger" than it), there's no hope to save it. Losing persons means losing builings, that means losing more persons during later turns and so on. This can easily happen in the first half of the game (and having to play three other turns with no hope to win can be acceptable for a 30-minutes card game, but not in a 2-hour strategy game!).

This game is old and hard to connect some players to at first.  I personally love it, maybe in part because it was one of my first Euros.

It's a fun game if a little long. I particularly like the way the Voice of the People works, with the population migrating from one city to another that provides the amenities they currently value most -- even if the city can't support the sudden influx of people!

Got this in one of the now famous UK "The Works" sales. Definitely good value for money at that price. Components could be better.

I enjoy this game more than the people I have taught it to. No one asks for it. I will need to push. Rather tense and unforgiving game - lots of factors to keep track of. Make sure you can feed everyone - and keep the damn population happy. And make sire you understand final scoring before you begin the game.

This game had a strong direct competitive element to it, and I like that opposed to the masturbatory games like 'Race for the Galaxy.'  It was certainly not as direct as a war-game though.  A good level of conflict for a civilization building game, which it is.  Whomever has the nicest city, people defect to, and citizans are victory points.

If you've played before the 2-hours should be about right for play-time.  I liked this, and hope the folks at home are warm to it as well.

good city building game.  holds up pretty well with only two players, but better with more.  a little heavy on the book keeping aspect.

It seemed ideal played with 2, the right amount of control and very little downtime between turns.  The voice of the people mechanic is very cool.

(Trade Interest: low) wow lots of decisions, and not that many possible in one turn.  we played, and several people made awful mistakes by not building the market early enough.  fun though.

Quite good, lots of strategy, involved. Only problem is if you play against someone really good and get behind early on, there's not much chance to catch up. Has that snowballing effect.

I love this as a simple, short version of a civilization/expansion game -- you really need to balance expansion with internal development to make sure the population stays fed. With experienced gamers, this provides a great "Civ Lite" feel in about 1.5-2 hours.

RATING: 7.5
The gameplay here lived up to my expectations as a tight, competitive, interactive Euro.  We seemed to be scraping for actions, resources and space throughout in a close interesting game.  The components do conspire to make this game a bit more fiddly than perhaps it needs to be (even with the population and food tracking chart in the BGG file section...).

In the end that fiddliness kept this from getting back to the table on a game night... which is too bad as there is a good game under the fiddling. Traded away.

"Unexpected" was what came to mind after my play of La Citta.  I was in fairly good shape going into and throughout the last round; I had plenty of food to feed my people as well as any small influx that may happen during the migration.  If I didn't end up first I was confident to at least come in a close second.  Then the unthinkable happened and culture (the worst possible choice) turned out to be the voice of the people.  So instead of the other players having to starve their population and take the negative hit in scores, I took their extra for them and I ended up dead last.

Sure one can make the argument that the random card draws cause the game to be somewhat chaotic, but for me I think that is part of the charm and the unpredictability of La Citta.  The placing of new cities and buildings can be very cutthroat, especially as prime real estates start to disappear and as one begin to encroach onto other's territories.  My only problem is how often you can get stuck with a bad set of political action cards and end up having to pick something suboptimal only to give the next person a good one in return.  I fear that decisions may become methodical with repeated plays, but for now it is a very tense and enjoyable 3-player game.

Can be a bit of a brain burner - avoid players who suffer from analysis paralysis.  I like all the trade offs between size of city, number of citizens, victory points, feeding, service points, etc. although it can be a bit hard to strategize with many players.

Wow.  This is six rounds of intense struggle to control more and grow, while having cities strong in the amenities important to the whim of the populace, yet without outgrowing your food production capacity.  Something about this game always called out to me, but then I'd look at the photos ambivalently - all those wasted years!  (OK, there were plenty of other good games I was playing, but this one should have been in the core group!)

After 2+ Plays: Liked it OK after my first play, not so much after my second.  This would be fine @ 90 min., but our games have taken closer to 4 hours, and there just isn't enough here to justify that length.

Very interesting game about building and managing your cities. You have to build certain buildings to allow your population to grow above a certain limit, but you also have to build farms so the population is kept fed, and you also need to build cultural, hygienic and educational buildings so your population don't emigrate to the other players' cities. Interesting mechanics and I like the variable board that, a bit like Settlers, will affect the whole game.

When I read the rules for the first time, I thought choices in the game would be obvious and easy to make. I couldn't see the challenge in the game. I had to play one game to realize how deep the game actually is, despite simple and intuitive rules. Components are simply beautiful! And for a multiplayer game, it plays very well with 2. Lots of interactions too! Only one negative point : it's too long!

I was actually quite surprised with this game. I took a punt on this for a bargain price from The Works, took absolutely months (over a year in fact) to get it to the table, and when I finally did, found it was actually a pretty solid game.

Extremely easy once you get the hang of it, great interaction as you try to entice the population of a neighbours city into yours, and it's really awesome to see the population of everyones city expand.

Would I pay full price for this? Almost certainly not. But for £6.99 it's one of my greatest game to cost purchases ever.

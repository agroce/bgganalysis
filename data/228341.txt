RATING: 8
It has a simple set of actions - but so many of them! I like the tension in picking just the right pair of dice to accomplish your tasks. It's quite smart in this although I think a bit overwrought in excessive options (running gates seem particularly situational and so difficult to really develop) - i.e. it is quite true that the game does not need the HQ board as recommended by the rules. Having said that, the variable set up and the large number of options for scoring plus the very clear execution of iconography left me with an anxious feeling of wanting to play again!

A very interesting game.  There's a lot to do... except when there isn't.  I think I'd always use the advanced mechanics.  I like how the patents push-pull on everything.  That being said, I'm very unsure about the transmitters.  I dislike the randomness of the planet tiles - some are okay, some are awesome, and it's random as to which one you find and land on.  I like the personal technology boards.  I dislike that 3 is the one number that is occasionally and absolutely useless (towards game end).  The game has excellent replay with all the variable components - patents, personal technologies, goals, transmitters, planet tiles, etc.

Overall, solid, interesting, and fun but I'm unconvinced.  I don't know that this is a must-have for me.

Initial rating is an 8. Might go down to a 7, but this was pretty cool. I don't know why, but all the weird jargon in this really throws me for a loop. Have I ever heard the word Gyrodyne before? Regardless, the dice drafting is pretty cool and there is a ton of replayability/variety.

"Pasted-on theme" describes the game pretty well, yet still it was fun to play so far. The design is old school and the components could be made prettier. Quick and easy rules, many paths to victory. None of the mechanics are new or anything special, yet they work flawlessly - though it probably needs some more plays, since the final point salad scoring seems to be shifted towards exploration points.

Pulsar 2849 is the definition of a point-salad game that quite successfully provides many different paths to victory. There are so many paths that it almost feels like a sandbox. The end-game goals can provide interesting incentives to the players to race/compete for certain sections of the sandbox (e.g., if two of the Gyrodyne goals are present). For being a dice drafting game, the game provides a ton of flexibility in how you can select your actions and, for the most part, your strategy is not overly reliant on the dice you've selected. And with only 2 or 3 actions per round, you'll never get everything done you want. Through the persistent point-scoring mechanisms and scoring modifiers, the game rewards planning and efficient use of the dice. It does all this without too much in rules overhead. (It takes time to explain the game only because there are so many options available to the players for action selection.) Further, the variability between sessions gives this game some solid legs. 

Still, there's something lacking -- it lacks a sense of immediate satisfaction at the end game. At the end, you scored a bunch of points, flipped some tiles and placed your tokens over a number of places. You enjoyed doing all that, but aside from the differences in points, there's little to differentiate yourself from the other players' similar efforts. Instead, you're left with simply the sense that you did better or worse than your opponents based on the final scoring. This is minimized a bit if you play Pulsar a few times with the same group -- the input variables and the openness of the game play allow the players to change strategies and continue exploring its system. Based on those multiple plays, the satisfaction can come from the subtle or not-so-subtle differences in how you accrued your points. This is a game that will grow on you as you play it more.

This game is amazing and the only thing preventing me from awarding it a 10 is that there can sometimes be a runaway leader problem. While Pulsar 2849 challenges you at every step with lots of interesting and important decisions, it doesn't really include any kind of catch up mechanism. A lot of times, it's pretty obvious who's going to win by the end of the next-to-last round.

Slightly lighter than I expected, but still very fun, and challenging enough to make you really consider moves carefully. Rules are very straightforward and smooth, and the iconography is very easy to understand. 

Trying to puzzle out which dice to choose and how best to use them is very fun: low numbers will (usually) advance you on turn order or give you cube income, but high numbers allow for more powerful activations. There is a dizzying number of choices, between techs, ship upgrades, stations, pulsars, and exploration, which also ramps up the fun. The one thing I wasn't fond of was the random exploration bonuses and exploration tiles. I wonder how the game would change if you left planetary systems face-up at the beginning of the game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent dice drafting game that fills up a much needed spot in my collection with its space setting. Players draft dice each turn then activate those dice to explore planets, build gyrodynes to harvest energy from pulsars, construct transmitters, and unlock technologies that give players access to special abilities. I love games with lots of variability and this one has tons! End game scoring tiles, technology board, planet tiles, and HQ boards are all randomized at the beginning of the game and will influence your overall strategy. Some people may not enjoy the "point salad" aspect of the game, but Pulsar seems to offer multiple possible strategies to achieve victory. The game can be a bit daunting at first with information overload but it really starts to click after a couple of rounds. I am really looking forward to exploring the game more!

RATING: 6
Dice drafting point salad game that if the designer wasn't on the cover you would swear it could be from Feld. Everything you do scores you points in this one and it's a lot to take in. From explaining the dice drafting and how it impacts turn order, to the actions you can take with your 2 or 3 dice each round, to round scoring there are just so many choices, and unfortunately that leads to a really long explanation. We didn't have much AP in our 2-player game but I can easily see this happening for some people because there are so many paths to explore you'll always min/max each turn. This makes me feel like experienced players will always trounce new ones given the amount of choices you have with your dice and will be better suited to get a bonus die each round which is extremely powerful. I'm torn on Pulsar 2849 because while I liked my play of it and would play it again, I have a hard time mustering up the energy to teach it.

RATING: 5
(Played 5 instead of 8 rounds.) Dice drafting, in some way reminiscent of Troyes or Yspahan, combines with walking around on a graph pick-up-and-deliver-style, combines with a point salad ending. The game has been lovingly polished to a dull luster, and offers a lot of VP options to explore. Unfortunately it creates those options by piling up stuff on top of more stuff instead of taking a step back and letting players work out incentives, collusions, and more of those difficult gaming bits. There are those who will love the way Suchý has worke out how to fit everything together, but regrettably I'm more and more turned off by such efforts. Again, it all seems to hold together pretty well in this title, and there is always [i]something[/i] you can do—surprisingly so even, I should add: opportunities mesh together in surprising ways—so don't be put off by my little rant above.

In the short introduction there were two things I gritted my teeth over somewhat. [u]The first[/u] is that owing to a somewhat careless selection of dice early on, the others could cement their lead in terms of obtaining extra action dice, thus beginning a nigh-unstoppable runaway leader pattern. That wouldn't be that. bad. were it not for the fact that I got boxed in very quickly too: this wasn't intentional behaviour on part of my opponents, it just 'happened' that way. Your position becomes extremely precarious under those conditions. You lack options to uncover planets which give you bonuses; and you don't get extra actions either. Of course the obvious response would be [i]Don't fall back on the order tracks[/i] and [i]Make sure you have Lebensraum[/i]; but fact is that players must be acutely aware of not making any major mistakes here, and play to avoid the scenario rather than try and repair it. [u]Second[/u] was that doing well on the board is rewarded extraordinarily well by the game. Visually there's not much to distinguish positions but boy can it translate into a massive &Delta;VP! Be careful here... leading to the question whether or not the game is actually as friendly as I was led to believe and you actually [i]need[/i] to 'annoy' other players in the way I was.

In the end not particularly great, but not particularly bad either. I think I'd play again... but only a handful of times. It just feels over the top too often.

The benefit or the payment for choosing the dice that will determine each player´s actions is the great original twist of this game.
Futhermore, there are so many available strategies to score points in the game that one can feel a bit overwelmed, especially after thinking there are (usually) only two actions per turn to do so many things!...
The game plays fast and is very enjoyable, although i still have my doubts if it is well balanced between all the several score tracks...

Played with four players and managed to come in second playing a strategy of building out level 2 pulsars and getting them spinning from 4th position in turn order. I liked the dice drafting mechanic and the way the game prevented players from just grabbing large dice all the time. The movement around the map with 4 was interesting and got tight at the end of the game as we all fought for the big settlement points. The upgrade abilities were nice but didn't seem to get a huge amount of focus from the group. We each had 1-2 of them claimed. I would like to play it a few more times but not as heavy as the game might look like with all the boards fanned across the table.

RATING: 8
Even by point-salad standards, this game features a lot of ways to score --- and that's without playing with the Headquarters boards. The game, like Grand Austria Hotel, uses serpentine dice-drafting, but you don't feel the drag of GAH with 3 or 4 players. The game brims with options; if someone beats you to one spot, another one, possibly just as good, will be available.

A game of really good decision making and replay ability. I love the dice drafting mechanisms in this game, where you have to make hard choices of taking high valued dice and move down on the two different track vs. taking a low die and move up on the tracks. I wish the personal boards had felt a little bit stronger, but maybe they will with repeated plays.

Ein Pulsar ist ein schnell rotierender Neutronenstern. Die Symmetrieachse seines Magnetfelds weicht von der Rotationsachse ab, weshalb er Energie entlang der Dipolachse bündelt und ausstrahlt. So weit, so Wiki. Im Jahr 2849 des Vladimír Suchý ist es den Humanoiden der Erde gelungen diese Energie zu nutzen und in einem Brettspiel verfügbar zu machen. Dafür braucht man Würfel für Würfelaktionen, die ein wenig an GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL erinnern ohne deren bedingungslose, anarchische Klemme. Dafür ist die Ermittlung eines Meridians sehr hübsch, der beim Nehmen des Würfels, den man haben will, gleichzeitig über die Gangrichtung auf zwei Leisten entscheidet, nämlich Startspieler und Energie. Und beides will man. Ansonsten spielt sich PULSAR 2849 nach zeitgemässem 2017er Brettspielverständnis und dies vorwiegend taktisch und angenehm gefällig mit Punktesalat Dank viel Untersysteme im Spielsystem. Es gibt doch einiges an Bereichen, wo man seine Würfelzahl einsetzen und sofort Punkte machen kann. Der brettspielende Astromann 2849 verfolgt locker einen Plan, den man je nach Astro-Pläne der Mitflieger durchs All reaktiv modifizieren und ergänzen muss. Die Gestaltung des Universums mag sich nicht richtig entscheiden, was sie eigentlich sein will und auch die Scheiben und Rakete sind kleinteiliges, freudloses Plastik, das im sonst schön großen Planaufbau zu Erbsen und einem Reiskorn schrumpft. PULSAR 2849 ist ein zeitgeistiger Brettspielentwurf, der das Jahr 2017 trotz Flug in eine unvorstellbare weit entfernte Zukunft trotzdem nicht verlassen wird. Dazu fehlt dem strahlenden Neutronenstern der unique Glanz. Dennoch bleibt Vladimír Suchý ein guter, eigenständiger Autor. DIE WERFT erreicht er mit seinem Schiff im Weltraum diesmal nicht.

This is the most point salad type game I've ever played. There's basically 2 main strategies: Gain small increments of points every turn or get a large end game wad of points. These paths seem balanced and they're both quite tricky to navigate with some interesting choices. 

I love the dice drafting mechanism, the way it punishes taking better dice by lowering your income and initiative is novel and interesting. There's also enough dice manipulation to allow for some choices if you get screwed during the draft, but they're still limited enough to cause tension during the draft. The patents don't work like patents at all, but they're nice bonuses for whatever strategy you're going for. The planet bonuses are nice, especially since you always have the option of getting a random, guaranteed points giving tile instead. All in all, a very balanced and interesting game...

But it isn't fun. It's not satisfying to spend your whole turn getting 2 things that will get you X points at the end of the game. It doesn't feel good to spend your turn building a gyro that will get you 1 point a turn plus some benefits. The patents and HQ benefits should be what gets you awesome future powers, but most are 1 time bonuses or some future points. You don't even get the satisfaction of denying someone else when you get a patent, since there's either 2 spots or your spot gets cleared the next turn. It has a long set-up and tear-down and some fiddly rules for what ends up being a pretty boring, yet well constructed game. I feel like they over-balanced this game.

It's a dice worker/dicement game about asteroids and mining! Except it's not Alien Frontiers, it's much more mathy than that. The game looks and feels heavy, I have the  Frontiers massive Big Box, and this game feels bigger. Lots of digital manipulation, lots of tiles and pieces. Not in any way saying it's bad as I need some more play time, just that it's a step deeper into deep space than Quantum or Alien Frontiers. A minor thing (ok, major dice snob reaction), the dice are made of wood, painted silver. Maybe this was a budget or aesthetic decision, but for a dice-centered game that takes place in space something more spacy would have been cool. Plastic dice with digital numerical characters on them maybe, metallic or circuit textured,  or even made of metal if that's doable in small presses yet.  If I have fun playing it enough I'll probably replace them with cooler looking dice.

This game feels a lot like Puerto Rico, and has all the good aspects of it (constant decision making, without direct aggression toward other players, which is good for relationships), and has so much more. It has so many moving parts and every game is completely different: what worked well once and helped you win by a landslide in one game, may be totally useless the next game depending on what others do and game variables. There's also very little randomness/ luck, which is great for strategy

FIRST IMPRESSION:

There is a lot of options in this game and there were some comparisons made to Castles of Burgundy (point salad, dice driven, focused strategies, etc). This game you probably don't want to do a little of everything but rather focus on doing one or two things well although you likely need to place planet markers for the end game scoring that is potentially massive there. The tech tree changes every game and each person has a unique personal development board. Recommend working towards being able to purchase a red die each turn as much as possible to maximize actions. Without red dice, you only have 18 actions. Explaining the game can be a bit challenging but I was pleasantly surprised that the game flowed by fairly quickly. The dice drafting and how it affected turn order and research cube acquisition was quite interesting and well implemented. Lots to explore here!

Initial Impressions from a shortened game: Wow I thought this game would be an abstract point salad soulless euro, but while it isn't the most thematic game out there the exploration of the worlds plus pulsar farming add least allows for avoidance of thematic disharmony. Also while there are a ton of ways to score points since you can specialize certain techs it feels more like multiple paths to victory (divergent) rather than point salady (convergent to a similar feel no matter what path you take).

The tracks combined with the dice drafting doesn't make much thematic sense but it is a fairly clever yet easy to learn mechanic.

I would guess this game would be best with 4, as the map doesn't change size with different players, so there would be more interaction in sniping of spots from your opponent with more players.

It is quite possible my rating will drop over time. Perhaps the currently divergent feeling point scoring options will feel dull over time and the dice drafting will feel like a euro doing something just because it can *cough* Elysium *cough*, but for right now I am riding the high.

Based on playing demo game (five rounds) at Essen. Choosing dice at the beginning of each round is an interesting mechanism. It forces you to weigh up your options for the round and balance what you want to do against the results of moving your markers on the tracks (which might help or hinder you in the future). All round, very enjoyable and look forward to playing it again soon.

This game is so precise and ridiculously balanced, after playing a few games we realised how the whole complex system balances play on a deep strategic level, this can be mainly seen on the dice drafting mechanism, which is implemented in a way I have never seen before. A game where you can truly see the consequences of your strategic choices. No matter which path you take, there really is no overpowered strategy. The game is also very modular, giving it a ton of replayability and it even has an advanced version, which adds a whole new dimension to the strategy. I especially love the graphics

I think I prefer those games to Pulsar, which is odd since this has the theme of space exploration, which is normally right up my alley. Unfortunately, much like this designer's other games, this felt very dry. It sort of reminded me of Quantum if it was a cube-pusher.

Pulsar 2849 is a point salad with innumerous way to score (discover planets for aggregated scoring, discover pulsars for continuous scoring, invest in technologies for various scoring and so on). The only distinguishing mechanic, the roll of dice that are selected and used for actions, is not enough to keep up the interest and the engines you build are too weak to provide any sense of progress. This makes the game an OK tactical affair but too long for what you get.

Excellent dice worker placement game.  At the start of the game I felt like I was getting nowhere, but by the end we were all zipping around the board, buying technology, and racking up big points.  Not my favorite dice worker placement game, but still excellent and looks good on the table.

Many choices but few actions make this game a real strategical game. There is no way to really mess up other players games but their choices strongly influence yours. The mechanic is good and the box offers an impressive amount of changing parameters from one game to another. It also looks good. A strong 8

A game of space exploration and construction. There is definitely a feel of travelling around the galaxy.

There seem to be at least a couple of paths to victory and you definitely have to be able to mitigate the dice rolls you pick.

Also, dealing with the lack of engineering cubes if you fall behind in the tracks early on is quite a challenge.

Pulsar 2849 is a dice-drafting game in which players are trying to visit planetary systems, building transmitters, and harnessing the power of pulsars with gyrodynes. In general, higher dice are better, but this is mitigated by advancing for low dice (or moving backwards for high numbers) on either a turn order track or an extra resources track. With each turn comes new technologies that can be claimed. Both these technologies and end-game bonus tiles will vary from game to game. I really enjoyed the variety of different ways to progress in the game, and how the available technologies helped refine your options. Overall, a very enjoyable experience.

In fact nothing new. Mechanics You konw well. But it fits together and.. wow, fine game! 
It's really good title, many paths to make points (point salad), many paths to win. Startegic and tactic inside. Optimization required, so it's our type of game.
I'm not a fan of dice placemanet, dice something-something mechanic, but this game has different feel.

Super impressed with this after a few plays. Dice selection is one of my favourite mechanisms and it is used brilliantly here, not only to choose actions and their potency but also to manipulate the turn order and engineering tracks. So many options, so many ways to score, so many potential (and seemingly balanced) routes to victory, the game may seem a little overwhelming at first but once you find your groove with it, this provides a fantastically rewarding experience. May yet modify my score to a full on 10/10.

RATING: 8
This is one of those tight worker placement point engine games. You get two actions per turn, and those actions are dependant on the values of dice you draft from the display at the start of the round. There are also clever ways to unlock a third die each round if you've planned well and lined yourself up properly. There are asymmetric actions on your player boards, different public goals each game, and even different action spots that slowly unlock as the game timer clicks down.

The core of the game however is to not get too distracted by this shinny, because the most action intense activity in the game, claiming and activating pulsar spots on the map, is a process that pays out tons of points at the end of each round. the trick is to efficiently set up your points income while making sure to get that extra action every round.  

It's possible that a player who gets a good lead early on might never get caught up to, although the game provides many large one time scoring opportunities which gives you the chance to make up a difference. I'm enjoying the game a lot because it has hits the sweet spot of being excited for your next move while simultaneously knowing you won't get to do half of what you want to do while also being happy with what you accomplished on a previous turn.

Awesome game that will be played again soon.

A surprisingly memorable dice drafting Euro, given that games of this genre are becoming quite common as of late. I think what makes this one stand out a bit more is that the dice draft is tied to two tracks – turn order and engineering. And so players are rewarded for taking low values, and punished for taking higher ones. There's also constant pressure to access red dice, which is equivalent to an additional action. Given that players only have 16 actions by default, any additional action is highly appreciated.

The only issue I have with Pulsar is that it's rather long for what it is. It's sort of expected given that it has the same 'rebound' order of drafting employed in Grand Austria Hotel. It's not quite as bad as in GAH though.

It's a dice drafting/allocation game, kind of like My Village and Grand Austria Hotel, with a space theme. Simple rules, really, although it takes a while to explain since there are so many options to review. The basic idea: roll a bunch of d6, arrange in sequential order, mark the median; players, switchback style, pick 2 dice each (for each die, move one of your markers -- initiative or turn order -- depending on your die's relation to the median value). Then, in turn order, use both your dice (and possibly a 3rd bonus die) to select an action each: move your ship (with an exploration element: tiles start out face down, you get various rewards for placing station on planets), work on a technology (which gives you a new power or modifies an action; more advanced tech becomes available each round), build/complete a Gyrodyne, build an energy array (which may give you a bonus die, usually gives you points), etc. At the end of the round, clean up: set new turn order according to that initiative track, award energy cubes according to the engineering track, score other end-of-round VP. At the end of the game (8 rounds), score VP for meeting specific (randomly drawn during setup) goals, board presence, initiative track position, etc. -- most VP wins!

Fun, want to play it again, but I think I prefer those other games over this one? Of course, I’ve only played the basic game so I definitely need to try the advanced technologies and goals.

I really enjoyed my first play of this.  There are about 4 different main ways to score, and it seems to pay to commit to two of them.  That leaves you with some solid strategic decisions to make, while you still have to figure out the best dice draft on any given turn.  If I could only have one dice drafting game, it'd be Grand Austria Hotel, but Pulsar definitely does a few things better.

tl;dr: fun exploration game

This game uses a kind of [thing=22345][/thing] style dice-action mechanism. But in this one you get punished for taking higher valued ones - the best ones in most cases.
The heart of the game is a map of the universe where players fly around, finding planets and such, getting energy... Everyone will also work and building a bit on an engine to be more efficient or flexible.
It's not as complex as some of the other games from [person=9307][/person] and it plays quite fast, but it has enough depth to satisfy me.
I quite enjoyed it and got a copy after trying. Oh, did I mention the price point is quite good for what you get?

On a superficial level, this reminds me of Solarius Mission: 16 actions, draft dice, travel through space, explore tiles on the board. However, this game is less complex while having a lot of options. After one play I think it is best to specialize, but sometimes the available dice require other actions.

Castles of Burgundy in space only not as good.

You get 18-24 actions for the game and you figure out how to get the most points out of each action. That's not a bad thing in itself, but for me there is no fun factor here. It's a by-the-numbers soulless euro.

Even though you draft your dice, it feels more random than Castles of Burgundy because of the median aspect. You get to move along tracks depending on which dice you take relating to the median, but sometimes it happens that you can't improve your position just based on how the dice turned out.

The game is also not great with four players. It is almost purely multiplayer solitaire and each player takes their whole turn at once, so there can be too much down time.

Would play again but I wouldn't suggest it.

3X space and sci-fi dice action selection exploring a circular planet-laned system, upgrading and leveraging personal and public tech-trees, and most importantly claiming pulsars, spinning up gyrodynes, and building transmitters for ultimate cozmo power! Tons of random setup around the circumference of the board. Break out the intro statistics textbook on median driven dice drafting cost on engineering and initiative tracks—different. I like games where turn order is more interesting than “clockwise”. Big trade off decisions with all the point salad choices.  Really important to coordinate the timing of tech upgrades with your game strategy.

The game seems very well balanced even though all the powers and avenues to victory are quite different. First time playing at a con with 2 other new players. We all took different routes and ended the game within 1 or 2 points of each other. I neither love nor hate space themes, but the mechanics definitely worked well with the theme for the most part (without it trying to be a thematic game). I played a shorter 5 round demo game (as opposed to 8 rounds) and I felt like that was the perfect length. Granted, I do prefer games on the shorter side, but I probably would not have minded another 3 rounds. Wouldn't buy it, but would play it a few more times easily.

GAME: Space Hulk (second edition)
RANK: 1762
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros:
Very thematic and tense. Simple rules and easy to play. Grid movement. 18 missions in the box with no need for expansions (unlike the 1st edition). I personally prefer the miniatures in the 2nd edition over the more elaborate miniatures in the 3rd and 4th editions. I also prefer the flame thrower rules in the 2nd edition.

Cons:
Much more fun as the terminator player than the genestealer player. The genestealer player has only one unit type and limited strategic/tactical options.

RATING: 8
An asymmetric tactical combat game fought between the few (but powerful) space marines and the innumerable horde of genestealers within a space hulk (a giant, ancient space vessel, made up of old space ships, asteroids, and space debris). It's a game with all the fluff, theme, and background of Warhammer 40k, but without the "collectible" aspect and with a good and simple set of rules! The minis and board pieces look absolutely great, and there's about as much flavor and theme as you could hope for in a game. The rules are easy to learn and teach, fast and furious, and intuitive. It's awesome!

I got this when I was 14 and the state of the box betrays a lot of love. Hasn't aged too well mechanically, sadly, but good for the occasional nostalgia kick. 

This has always been 'Aliens' the board game for me and conveys the tension and theme of the movie perfectly.

RATING: 8
Great miniatures as usual. Game play is quick and exciting with little or no down time. In fact, time is not on the marine's side.

Some of the missions are clearly more difficult to achieve and is still dependent on the die rolls.

Very additive. 

Painted miniatures will bring this to the extreme!

One of the most thematic games in my collection. It really makes you feel like the marines in the movie "Aliens", in which the game was clearly inspired.

All the scenarios are fun and challenging. Some are unbalanced to one side, some to the other, and quite a few are pretty neutral.

I tend to play each of them twice, switching places between the marines and the aliens. 

I play with painted minis of the space marines and with horrorclix minis of the aliens from the movie. It makes the experience even more thematic. I also like to play with the timer, specially in scenarios unbalanced in favor of the marines.

I also recommend buying or getting somewhere the rules for the 1st edition's deathwing expansion. It introduces new weapons for the marines that are really cool. Of course, you'll have to find the minis that correspond to those weapons in the warhammer world. These new marines and the scenarios that come on the deathwing expansion really enhance the experience.

In summary, one of the best games in my collection, a must buy for those that like tactical combat, dungeon crawl and science fiction games.

A watered down version of the rules.  Took out the timer but added some nice features to the game through "White Dwarf" mag articals.  Same plastic Genestealers but updated (better for the time) SM Termies

Enjoyed the simplicity of gameplay, with just enough thought to give the feel of the enclosed spaces. Much better with the select rules options released in White Dwarf & better for ease of play than previous or more modern editions.

After experiencing first edition and expansions, this version seems like a step back.  Still, it's worth getting if you don't want to invest in all the first edition has to offer.

Owning this (2nd edition) means I passed on the chance to get 3rd edition when it came out. Looking back I consider that a huge mistake. This version is okay, but it is not as good as 3rd.

RATING: 9
The new flamer rules are probably more realistic but depending on the scenario are also much more difficult to pull off a win. The new sustained fire rules are weaker and don't really get beefed up by the overkill rules. Still, it's Space Hulk and any version is worth having.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In comparison to 3rd ed, I think I prefer 3rd ed. The rules here are a bit dumbed down and simple, and I really miss the timer for the larger maps. What I do like in the edition is the flamer rules and the custom dice (so easy to see if its a hit or miss).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This edition looks much cooler with updated minis and tiles. I have to say that I play with the 1st edition rules regarding the use of a timer, command points, and flamer usage. I actually house-ruled flamers so they could choose between what type of shots they wanted to take: 1. Individual flame hits, 2.Blow 6 shots at once to flame a whole section even if you can't see every space, 3.Suicide if you have at least 2 shots to flame an entire section and blow the doors off. There are a couple more house-rules I've made but great game nontheless.

This edition with the pewter minis from that era (sold separately) is the best-looking edition, IMO.  I'm not a fan of the shiny, super-thick tiles or the diorama-esque Miniatures from 3rd Edition.

I had this, but I dont think I did much with it. It was definately an improvement quality over the 1st edition, but I cant remember if anything about the rules/game to set it apart from the others.

Solid, simple, seeped in background. Oh, and the marines actually CAN win. They get eaten afterwards either way, but who really cares. They are just the pinnacle of the panhuman eugenics of the god-emporor, each and everyone priceless warrior and result of decades of selection, training, and so forth, ultimate machines of war and destruction whatever.

Finally it's been separated from the 1st edition page!

A long time favourite of mine, SpaceHulk is tense, atmospheric and gripping. A serious chess player may scoff at the idea, but Space Hulk is the sci-fi equivalent of Chess on so many levels. Trying to plan ahead, calculating every move, it's an excellent strategy game.

I seem to stand alone here, but in some ways I prefer 2nd Edition to 1st and 3rd- I enjoy the extra strategy that comes from the Flamer's small ammo stack. Short controlled bursts or blasting the cartridge dry in one might blaze, the flamer definitely had something that the 1st and 3rd flamers don't.

2nd Edition also has more scenarios then the other two.

Who can play?  Uber-geeks.  2 players.

2nd editon.  This is a fabulous mission based game.  Squad tactics and strategy similar to Advanced Heroquest, theme similar to the movie "Aliens" but in the Warhammer 40k world.  I've defeated all of the missions . . . eventually.

2nd Edition.  Compared to the first edition of this I game, I much prefer this edition's plastic miniatures, cardboard tiles and doors.  I enjoy playing this game, but not as much as the first edition (I particularly like the timed Marine turns from 1st ed. which this edition lacks).  I do prefer how the flamer (flame thrower) works in this edition though (you target individual squares instead of whole sections).  A fine game that I still enjoy playing even after 15 years.

In my comments for the 1st edition I said: 'If I ever got to play this again it might strip the rosy tint from my spectacles' Well, it didn't. It's still just as joyous as I remember. We play the same house rules as when I was a kid, one player as the genestealers and everyone else as Blood Angels, taking charge of a squad, or a couple of models. we take out the timer and replace it with three or four people, none of whom want their models to die, arguing about the best strategy in front of the baddie (me) who occasionally stirs the pot to ensure dissent reigns. good times.

RATING: 6.5
A 2-player dungeon-based stand-alone miniatures game based in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. It has modular board pieces for different maps for different missions. The 2 factions are very different meaning the strategies are asymmetric. I tend to find it almost impossible for the heroes to win so what you can do -if you have time for two games (2-3 hours)- is switch sides and play the same mission again to decide the winner by who does better as the heroes.

Classic matchup of good but few vs. crappy but many.  Scenarios vary from very fun to mediocre.  The idea is cool, but the luck factor is pretty frustrating.  Still, there's some neat tactical tricks, and the feeling of playing the marine player is nice and claustrophobic.  Certainly worth trying once.

RATING: 10
This is the bastard step child version, the one that purists love to hate.  They did away with the timer and added combat dice with hit icons.  But there were plenty of scenarios and for those that didn't like the pressure element of the game it was pretty good.  I have all three versions of the game and liked this until 3rd edition came out with the better board graphics and figures.

Tried to improve on perfection.  Fell a bit short.  A few rules changes weren't improvements.  Lacked the First version's expansions, and the Third/Fourth version's over-the-top production values.  But, I like it.

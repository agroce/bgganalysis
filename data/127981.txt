I may be over-rating this a bit right now. But the fact that my wife actually had fun with it and requested a 2nd and 3rd play right after trying it out is a really good sign. I think it's a very neat 2 player system. The rulebook is a bit vague and sort of an obstacle. I had to clarify a number of things online. I also think I'd rate it lower if I didn't have the expansion(s) to go with it for alternative scenarios.

(Own base + Dragon/Damsel and Lords of Undead expansions. Rating is for the whole set together)

This game is tremendous fun! It seems very well balanced - neither side seems easy. I like the cat and mouse nature of it, where it really feels like you aren't sure of what your opponent is going to do.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting, fast deduction (?) game but feels somehow lacking in "dungeon-crawl"-ness. Despite that, it's a fun short game that I'll break out any time I need a quick teo-player game where I can trash talk my opponent into making bad decisions. There is an expansion that I have not played.

RATING: 6.5
This game tries to capture the feel of a dungeon crawl in a small package.  The production quality is quite good and the box packs quite a bit of gaming goodness.  Game play for this does capture some of the right feel, but its a tad shy of nailing it.  Play feels abstract-ish and it's a bit light.  Had this been "Tiny Epic Dungeon"... it likely would have really be top notch.  As an early Gamelyn title that's forgivable.  It's still descent and it has the added benefit of solo play.  A nice small box addition to a game collection.

Tried this out finally and it seemed that the monsters are coming out much more slowly that it is actually pretty easy for the heroes to win. Looks like have to add the expansions in to get a better idea. So far both plays ended with the heroes winning against the dungeon master.

The game sets out to be a 2 player "lunchtime" game and I think in that it succeeds. A Tiny Epic game before the era of the "Tiny Epics (tm)", this is a good bluffing game, with some character power asymmetry making things not as clear. 

Some of the board states can be utterly crushing for the player controlling the heroes, and as the nemesis, if you don't draw your good traps early, the heroes can get a headstart on you. Still it is fun and you are playing against the other player for the most part, as opposed to fighting the luck of the draw!

I've only played this solo, but it was enough to know I want to try it more. It's a fun design and easily one of the most portable dungeon crawl, asymmetric, minis combat games I have ever played.

Fun game. One player plays the four heroes trying to get the treasure. The other player plays the dungeon player and they kill the Heroes. There is a fun solo variant. The solo player plays the Heroes and the game plays the Dungeon Player.

RATING: 8
Fairly straightforward 2 player dungeon crawl. The dungeon master lays down tiles face down including monsters, traps, tools, and treasure. The adventurer navigates four characters through them to find the treasure without dying first. Lots of bluffing and memory aspects, ends up taking 30-45 minutes.

Two Player Game - Light, quick game with a nice "fun" factor. My rating may go down overtime due to the game possibly being unbalanced in favor of the dungeon master, but I would need more plays to be sure. Even so, unbalance in a game doesn’t bother me as long as the game provides a good experience, which this does. If necessary, I would consider changing the monster abilities so that they would have to be on the same tile to attack. This would definitely swing the balance back in favor of the heroes. 

Solo Game - I misunderstood the rules in the first play, and I let the goblins attack diagonally; I got crushed. Even with the correct rules, it is still challenging, but fun. One of the first board games I've ever tried solo.

Fast, easy to learn, and a lot of fun. I like that as the Dungeon Master you need to do the best you can with what you have. So there is a decent amount of strategy paired with a little bit of luck. Then as the hero you get to play with trying to puzzle out how to best use your characters at the same time that you flirt with the games push your luck mechanic. I just love how both sides felt different. This is a great game that is beautifully produced!

After 3 plays it is one of the worst games i ever played. It is unbalanced, luck driven and feels unplaytested.

Delay the adventurers with traps/generic tiles, keep your monsters back and when they activate go for the fighter.

Based on 1 play where we butchered the rules I really enjoyed it. It seemed imbalanced (in favor of both sides at different times based on our misunderstanding of the rules) but seems to easily accomplish what it sets out to do - be a speedy asymmetrical dungeon crawl. Great meeples too!

As for Dungeon Heroes as a game, either we were playing wrong or it's hard as eff for the hero player. I was the Dungeon Poobah and easily slaughtered the heroes pretty much as soon as the aggressive phase started. Either way, it's interesting and challenging and more than just the "DungeonQuest, only not as much fun" as it seemed at first.

The rules are written in a slightly backwards way, so that on many of the playthroughs we've got at least one rule wrong. Is a short, light and fun 2 player game though.

RATING: 3
The good: excellent production value. Love the meeples, love the small box. Make a proper dungeoncrawler that looks like this and I'll buy it for sure. 

The bad: The actual game here is a poor match for the dungeon theme. It has elements of minesweeper and stratego, and I'd honestly rather just play stratego. Just not very much fun, I'm afraid. Also, the designer bio on the box comes across as very amateurish, like something from a community theatre program. Finally, the rulebook is poorly written.

I think the production quality and size of the game is great.  The look of it is fun too.  I also like the characters and their powers, as well as the damage dice.  The thing I don't like about the game is the dungeon tiles.  Something about how they play out just turns out to not be fun.

RATING: 6.5
Normally abstract games are not my choice, but the wonderful meeples got me, and they make it feel less abstract too. The game is fun if you're in the mood for a low luck, filler, strategy game. 

Setup is a pain, I suggest just using the same tiles every game, at least for us it's not that big of a deal to do that.  Otherwise you have to sort all 46 tiles every game. Rule book is kind of confusing and leaves some unanswered questions, but once you get passed that the game is quite simple to learn. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Awesome meeples aside, this game is terrible.  There is a good concept of second guessing, but the execution leaves most turns as either obvious or random.  On rare occasion, you will solve a puzzle to find the obvious move, or (gasp) make a choice involving a legitimate tradeoff.

The solo game is even worse, as the second guessing has been removed by luck and the maneuvering has been removed by obvious puzzle solving.

solo: 2/10
duo: 3/10

RATING: 6.5
Played 16-07-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Fun little game in which two sides face of. One aims to get 3 treasures, the other side tries to block those using monsters and traps. The player striving to get 3 treasures is the heroes. You have a wizard, Rogue,  fighter and cleric. Wizards flip tiles,  rogues remove traps, fighters kill monsters and clerics heal.

Each turn starts with the DM grabbing 4 tiles from an assortment. Then, he may place these face up or face down, but has to take 4 actions. One of the actions is move attack with monsters,  the other reveal tiles.. 

The hero also spends 4 actions, however never more than 2 per character.

This results in a nice,light filler game in which there is some strategizing. I liked it. Artwork could have been better but the meeples as minis for heroes and monsters are nice.  Nice game.

This is an interesting tile laying game. The dungeon lord does a lot of bluffing, and the party tries to get past traps and monsters as efficiently as possible. I think that the game may favor the dungeon lord, but I would need to play many more times before I could really tell.

Only played solo, no expansion tries yet!

A quick solitaire that I can put out and enjoy is great, and this is a fun one for unwinding in front of some TV.  The wood meeples are fun and all the components are nice; the board doesn't take up that much space, but the individual tiles don't feel cramped.

Sorting the tiles doesn't take very long, but it's definitely a little tedious at first, when you have to reference the rules to figure out how much of what to shuffle in.  But really, it's an unavoidable drawback to an otherwise quick and fun little game.

Played it twice since receiving my Kickstarter copy, and it's pretty fun. It kind of reminds me a teeny bit of Stratego (loosely of course, but it has a similar feel when I play it). 

Gameplay goes by very quickly, so this is a decent filler game in my opinion.

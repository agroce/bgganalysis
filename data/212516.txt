Abstract:
Quite innovative worker placment game: changing (foldable) (country) boards, workers are not done after they are placed, and workers can be joined by other players. Moreover, you lay claim on a country board and collect all placed workers in it at the end of a round. The game comes with a lot of Meeples.

Thoughts:
Keyper is more sandboxie because you have a lot of more options while Keyflower feels more long-term strategic (due to the winter tiles). I like Keyflower more because it plays faster.

Similar to Keyflower (without auctions).

RATING: 9
I really like this one!  It's an engine-building, point-scorer but with a few twists.  You need to manage obtaining tiles against scoring them (and scoring the fair tiles) while also managing your worker supply (and how fast you play them) and choosing a country board.  I definitely saw a negative-cycle, where poor choices early on (namely in selecting a country board and managing worker placements in view thereof) have farther ripples down the line, but I think that might just be another element of the game.

I definitely like this better than the other key games.  I was not a fan of Keyflower and my other most-liked key game is Key to the City London.  This one is better.  A bit more dense, no annoying auction elements, a stronger focus on the engine-building.  Worker placement is the overriding mechanism here and you'd best remember that.

I'm very happy I kickstarted this one!

After struggling through the rules the game plays surprisingly easy. The rulebook mentioned it somewhere and after first play it proved it is true. It also took a while to get all the parts of the game known. But it's a game you want to play again and that's the good thing about. Decent work.

EDIT: It seems I was mistaken about the inconsistency of tile icons. Instead, there is inconsistency with how they are referenced in the rulebook. Tiles that work the same are not all described the same in the glossary. So, make sure you understand the iconography and don't rely on the glossary to be an accurate reading of how the tile works.

11/17: It's a nice variation on the Keyflower system with a few noticeable flaws.

The Good: The spatial component of Keyflower has been greatly reduced, and my least favorite part - movement of goods - has been completely excised.

The Bad: Tiles are no longer earned through auction (the best part of Keyflower!), but are instead incorporated into the action drafting. In combination with the tame action blocking compared to Keyflower, this results in a much less interactive game.

The Ugly: The rulebook is atrocious. Some rules are ambiguous, the sections are not laid out in a logical way, and the glossary is by type of tile and then alphabetical, rather than straight alphabetical. The iconography is both poor AND inconsistent. Some tiles have hard limits on how much they can be used, but that information is only in the poorly-organized glossary (see above), not on the tile itself. "One resource of any type" is represented by both an uncolored (i.e. white) resource and by a multi-colored resource, not just on separate tiles but on the front and back OF THE SAME TILE! Finally, the action boards (season boards?) are just a flashy way of allowing the players to influence what actions are available each round. It could have just have easily been done as a set of cards or mini-boards with icons to limit which ones can be placed together. As-is, it's way more efficient to look in the rulebook at the four possible configurations (in a too-small graphic, I might add) and choose one, then to figure out your configuration by actually using the board.

Still waiting for the core auction/action drafting system from Keyflower to be re-implemented into a better game. This is not it.

First Play: Make sure everyone has a copy of pages 15-20 of the rules so they can cross reference what the farm and village tiles do. Otherwise there will be massive downtime queuing for the rule book.

First game is getting to grips with what the tiles do but the laying down and placing of the Keyples rules is fiddly. We played the first season incorrectly and only checked the rules because the structure of the game seemed wrong.

I really liked the nods to the previous Key games but is is different enough to stand apart on it's own merits. Less brutal than Keyflower. The folding boards are an interesting puzzle but did seem to slow the game up. Rating will improve with more plays.

RATING: 6.5
Played once with three players. Nonblocking workerplacement with resource conversion and variable personal goals. 

While the base mechanic of placing a meeple (keyple) and executing the chosen action is simple, the number options to choose from are not. It's an overwhelming load of information to take in at first play (and probably on second and third also). There are at least 19! different resources to gather and multiple ways to turn them into victory points. There are 7+1 different worker meeples and with four players there are 48 action spaces to choose from and that's excluding the 20 spaces you could place a meeple on your player board.

Negative: The load of options and the randomness of goal tiles makes strategizing hard. On my first play it was almost all tactics for the current round without a clear goal what to reach for. On the other hand; It's pretty low risk to get a goal tile that seems difficult to fulfill because there's so many options in Keyper, you're bound to find a way to reach that goal anyway.

Positive: Everything you do amounts to something which leaves a nice buzz. That's a pitfall also; Keyper isn't about how much you get, but how much more you get than your opponents. There's almost no way to block your opponent since there are so many ways to profit from one another. Often, the best you can do is preventing your opponents from benefitting too much.

We took 3,5 hours for our first play with three players. It certainly wasn't the worst way to spend time, but that's pretty long for a game where strategy seems a moving target.

Hooray! I was able to pre-order a copy of the Character Edition and I am so excited! It looks wonderful and adorable :D

I played through a 2 player game to test it out and I an very excited to ay a 3 or 4 player game. The fact that actions can be joined by others makes them even better.

My poor brain has melted by the end of the 2 player learning game but after recovering a bit I wanted to play again.

Really interesting combination of mechanisms in what is another successful entry in the Key series. A simple good conversion game at its core, the game really shines with the use of the various colored "keyples" to improve the actions you take. While every player start out with the same amount of type of workers, subsequent rounds will will asymmetry with is a nice twist to add some variability. The folding are also really awesome to make each game very different than the previous ones. Biggest complain is the graphic design. Some of the color choices are a bit too close and we had to constantly refer to the rulebook for tiles because they weren't clear enough to understand just from the iconography. Despite these minor issues, a very good game for fans of the series.

So much to enjoy here, and we did. The game here is getting engaged with how and when you join other players and where you play your keyples. This makes for very neat interaction, but not the variety that I can really dig into. The player board hinted at a puzzly nature, but didn't go to the lengths that would thrill me. I really enjoyed every aspect, but it didn't come together to a whole that would engage me in future plays, especially with my beloved Keyflower sitting over my shoulder.

Sajnos muszáj a keyflowerhez hasonlítanom, mert elég sok a hasonlóság a kettő között. És ezt az összehasonlítást magasan a keyflower nyeri, ami nem nagy baj még, mert az egyik kedvenc játékom. Itt nagyon lázba hozott az akciótáblák lapozhatóság, eleve ezt szánták a fő csalogatónak valószínűleg. Az első fájdalmam az, hogy ez jól néz ki, a de játékban vajmi kevés jelentősége van annak, hogy akkor az egyik táblát éppen hogy hajtom a három oldala közül. Mivel sok tábla van így az a minimális változás amit beviszek ezzel, elenyésző. Persze megértem, hogy vad különbségek se lehettek volna, mert akkor meg ha mindenki ugyanazt az extrém oldalt választja, megakadhat a játék. De ez így sajna soványka lett. Ezen felül nem éreztem valahogy különösebben engine építést se, nem volt meg a működő kis világ létrehozásának érzete. Elég egyszerű pontmaximalizálás zajlik minden körben, aminek az irányát nagyon meghatározzák a vásárok. A táblafoglalós, meeplevivés is jó lenne jó ötlet, nagyszerűen működik is a keyflowerben, de itt nem. Elég ollós ez a mechanika, inkább frusztráló, semmint szórakoztató. Nem rossz, nem rossz, de a keyflower után ennél magasabban van a léc.

Pretty great! Not as confrontational as Keyflower, but the join and lay down mechanics are really interesting. You don't want too many workers, as that can actually help your opponents, but if you get too few, you're at the mercy of the other players.
They flip boards are kind of gimmicky, but it's a nice way to influence what gets on the board next round.
Another hit by Breese! (At least I think so.)

Breese knows his stuff, so no doubt it's a pleasant and pretty game that (once you overcome setup and terminology hurdles) is easy to play and offers some tough choices. That said, its chief innovation--the joiner mechanic--doesn't really sing unless you descend into AP-prone territory of scrutinizing everyone's board. I much prefer the auction system of Keyflower.

Now this game did nothing for me... I always check all Key games and none has been bad, but this one I really couldn't stand.

So much stuff for nothing. It has all been done a thousand times before, but in a much more interesting way. In the end all you do is gahtering points in form of ressources with no interesting choices to choose from. Not saying that it doesn't matter what you do, but it's neither fun, nor interesting, just plain boring.

Worst Key game so far by a mile!

RATING: N/A
Initial impression after first play: not so good as keyflower.

There are some special mechanics, making the gameplay different from common worker placement games, but also making the gameplay less smoothly. Some rules are just not intuitive for the first game. Also I am never a fan of "asking to join" rule.

The game doesn't feel tense as in keyflower. There are so many available action spaces. You can also place on (or join) an occupied space. The main decision comes from choosing what country tiles to build, rather than determining action space priority. The tension feels more like Caverna than Agricola, which is not a good sign for me.

The cleanup is not easy. All tiles are mixed during gameplay. However, spring country tiles, non-spring country tiles, home tiles have to be separated for the next game. You have to look closely to tell them apart.

As for the foldable country board, it by does look innovative, fancy, and fun to manipulate. However, in my opinion it does not work very well. To be specific, each country board can be folded to have 12 different layouts, of which 4 are spring, 4 are summer, 4 are autumn/winter. At the season beginning, each player manipulates the board to show a desired layout for that specific season. It is not easy to find 4 layouts (out of 12 possibilities) belonging to that specific season. In the end we have to look up in the rulebook to find possible layouts for that season.

I wasn't expecting a lot from Keyper, but this game really impressed me.

Although the folding boards are a gimmick, they serve their purpose, which is to change the resources available in a season.

first impression, this is a worker placement game with sharing, and a choose-your-points-tiles scoring.  It feels a lot like Keyflower but is missing the auction, in its place are more types of resources, specialized workers, and the space-sharing mechanism. I don't feel it is particularily innovative and the point-salad type of scoring leads to a lot of tedious counting, but otherwise it was fun

Quite good, and I do look forward to playing more, but...  it feels somewhat overwrought.  My opinion may improve as I get used to it...

The rules, terminology, and iconography needed more work and editing.  
1. There's inconsistent iconography (two different ways to depict "any color").  
2. The wheat is sort of wild but with exceptions and these facts are well hidden in the rulebook and not shown anywhere with iconography.  
3. Bizarrely, there are at least 3 different areas given pointlessly similar names:  "your keyp tile", "a keyp field on a country board", and "the keyp area on your player board".

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Rules are not as bad as I've seen some say but there is a fair bit to get through and sometimes it is challenging to reference certain rules. Lots of wood! Sets score a la Keyflower at the end of winter according to which tiles you have and like Keyflower you can also upgrade your tiles to enhance their ability/scoring. However, no one else can play on your country board. The central boards that fold are somewhat annoying/fiddly but it works - just doesn't provide as much modification as one might first think. Our experience in the first game was that there was not much laying down of workers outside of when you claim a tile with a keyper since we all seemed to run out of meeples about the same time - although some of that will depend on how much following can occur due to meeple colors, etc. The gray and white meeples looked very similar in the lighting. Potential for AP is considerable due to the different buildings and options.

Not a bad addition to the Key universe, but Keyflower still holds my heart. I like all of the different animals in this game, and the fair tiles are a great avenue to score points since you don't have to give up the resources to score them as you move through the seasons/rounds. There are definitely unique mechanics in this game, which sets it apart from it's Key brethren.

Initial Impressions: I would imagine the dynamics of this game would change a lot with more than 2, but now that I think of it I am not sure it would be for the better. The thing is the joining in on other people's actions would probably be more interesting if more people could do so, but I feel the game would get sloggy with having to ask more people if they want to join in every single action. 

Make no mistake about it, this is a very soulless euro. There are a ton of different resources that you are trying to convert to points in one way or another, with little differentiating one from another. However, its unique use of joining in on other actions, different workers, being able to kind of draft what workers you get, and the laying down mechanism actually at times making it better to have less workers next round makes for a really cool take on worker placement. Therefore, the game had a great action system (in the workers and a terrible way to score your ability to use that action system well (through the ways to convert things to points). Keyflower also had this pro and con, but I feel it is more extreme in Keyper.

Played once, not a fully formed opinion yet. The game wasn't quite as I expected and I have yet to come to grips with that.

+ Coloured meeples get a bonus if on fields of their own colour
+ Joiner mechanism where players can cooperate and both profit
+ Foldable action boards are great, fantastic invention! (too bad you only fold them three times per game)

- I'm missing some kind of progress, story or bigger picture. Most of the game seems to be just getting resources and buildings for the end scoring. Had the feeling I'd played a very long and complex set collection game.

RATING: 7
First Impressions (2 plays):
The rulebook takes a bit to fully understand, but after the first play, the gameplay feels pretty straightforward.  Not easy to reference the rulebook with rules questions.

Appears to have several different strategies to pursue (animals, buildings, shipping, fairs). The tiles you obtain in spring will start to influence the strategy you pursue the rest of the game.  

Right now, if I had a choice between this and Keyflower, I'd probably pull this out for 2 player.  If I have more players available, then Keyflower will be hitting the table instead.  They both are solid engine building games that manage to feel different from each other due to how the tiles are obtained.

Update after 4 plays: Strategies appear to be fairly straightforward so the decisions being made aren't very compelling to me.  I love the idea of following and wish it made for tougher decisions.  However, I didn't feel like I had to account for my opponents potentially getting a great free move like I would in Puerto Rico, Race for the Galaxy, Eminent Domain, etc.  

This game doesn't appear to be filling a niche in my collection so I don't know that I need to own a copy.  I also don't think this is a game I need to play 30+ times.  Would gladly play someone else's copy, though.

A Masterpiece.

The folding boards, while at first seemingly a gimmick, are an ingenious means of giving players control of what action spots are available.

The joining action creates such a great amount of player interaction.  Often, you'll be eager to join on others' turns.  Just as often, you'll be loathe to have others join you on yours.

The game is so well balanced with the changing distribution of keyples.  While every player I've played with has been dismayed at first when realizing they had fewer keyples in a season, they quickly realized what an advantage this can be as they laying down action is very powerful.

In terms of variety, there are so many different buildings in the game that you would have to play some astronomical sum of games (or be very lucky) to play the same game twice.  This means each game requires you to think on your feet.  Not that that should turn anyone off.  Your given starter buildings create a fairly potent strategy if you can get them into play properly.

My point is, this game has depth and breadth like few others do.

This won't replace Keyflower, nor should it.  They are two magnificent games that deserve a place in any Euro gamers collection.

Solid game, well designed, well balanced. Original for its folding boards, the meeple management stuff concerning joining and laying down actions and the overload board if you get too many meeples. The game itself, while involved, is not that complicated once you get the hang of it. Focus should be on points engines and efficiency in your actions, that's where you can make the difference. All in all it's a game I enjoyed playing, but it didn't blow me away either. In the end it's another variation of collecting stuff and converting it into points, of which there are so many already. I'll play it, if someone suggests it.

Clever worker placement game.
Flipping of boards are surely a gimmick (not too important for gameplay).

Rest of the game is very solid. Would probably rather have skipped the flipping board and put focus on something else, but it's not bad!

Well - In a few words: I m missing the elegance of Keyflower. The rules are very hard to understand. I don t like the layout and a lot of more examples would help a lot especially with turning the meeples down. The boards are THE mechanism. Anything else is exchangeable. 
And finally I don t know if I like a game lasting nearly 4 hours to have a score 98-98-97-97. 
But I have to read now the rules again what we might played wrong and doing that is again hard work

Great components

I am not a big fan of uwe rosenburg games, I feel like they force me to do everything or else I will get negative points. Keyper feels like a rosenburg game, but more of a sandbox where you can choose which strategy you want te employ. I really like that. Interesting about this game as well is that the player interaction is positive. Joining the actions of others benifits both players. Combine that with the tension of claiming a board and different coloured workers and this feels like an original take on worker placement. The component are excellent, love the animal meeples and especially the flipping boards. Really fun to play with. I recommend this one if you enjoy exploring different strategies in a sandbox game like me.

I'm a great fan of Keyflower, particularly the idea of using each others' infrastructure and make production more expensive for the owner. Keyper turns this mechanism around by actually giving both players more actions when producing at the same tile. This is not necessarily a good thing if the first player lacks the resources to take the actions or simply don't need the resources.

Another interesting mechanism is that placed workers ("keyples") belong to whoever claims the particular board first. Since keyples of the same color tend to end up on the same board (since colors must match to produce together), the players must plan for which colors they will be needing next season. Unfortunately, this unintentional monopolizing of a color means less help from other players. I need to play more to assess whether this adds a strategic dimension or removes player interaction.

The most distinguishing mechanism, the flexible board, gives the players more freedom to configure the conditions each season by choosing which fields to be available. Again, I need to play more to assess whether this adds a strategic dimension as there are so many options to choose from anyway. 

Based on my first impression, I still consider Keyflower to be the better game thanks to the tense interaction from the bidding and blocking compared to Keyper's helping. There are also so many different scoring options (animals, resources, fairs, shipping, buildings etc.) that the players may be distracted from the interesting interaction and focus too much on their own boards. Nevertheless, Keyper is a worthy member of the Key family with unique challenges for the players.

I love the idea and different ways to win. A nice casual game. The quality of the pieces are good, and I love the mechanic for gaining your keyples (workers) as well as the lay down actions. It is relatively unique, but also has some similarities to Keyflower. A solid game. However, the few number of tiles make it repetitive after some plays. Some expansions and promos would greatly improve play for me. An organizer for this game is a must as it can be difficult to set up and put away, making it not a game to frequently hit the table, but fun when it does. Players are not necessarily waiting around for the turn, but deciding their next course of action or whether or not they want to "join" another player which greatly improves the play for our group.

Gosh.

This is what happens when Richard Breese gets his hands on Rosenberg-esque goods overload and overlays some of the magic that made Keyflower. It's not quite the match of its predecessor, but it does broadcast all of the overchromed goodness of Fields of Arle or Caverna, with the trademark Key twists.

Distinctly less impressive with two, where the start player mechanic starts to be compromised.

Keyper is in essense a resource-gathering game.  Players have a number of differently-colored meeples, and can place them on an area of the game board--ordinarily they get the resource, but if they match the color of the space they get double resources, and if another player chooses to "follow" by putting their meeple of the same color there, both players get triple resources.  Players can also claim one of the four parts of the modular game board, and they'll get those meeples back for the following round.  Players have extra incentive to use the "follow" action, because once they run out of meeples, they can lay down meeples on the board that they claimed to do those actions again, essentially giving them free actions.  In the following round, players can arrange their claimed board in one of a number of different configurations by folding it in one of several ways.  The rest of the game mostly involves building and improving buildings and animal pens, the former to do some resource conversion and be worth points, the latter to fill out with animals for points.  I thought this was a fairly solid game where everything seemed to work well together.  I was a little frustrated with the folding boards because it was difficult to evaluate my choices when I couldn't look at them at the same time.  No real complaints other than that, but I wasn't super-enthused about anything either--it was just really solid.

It feels like a mix of Colonists and Caverna with a splash of Keyflower. You have these boards on the table that fold in 16 different ways (4 for each season) and each player will get to decide how they fold it. It's unique although it might be a bit gimmicky instead of practical. You can also unfortunately end up with all the players choosing the exact same layout in future rounds which was bizarre and kind of a letdown when you saw all the boards out on the table.

You have player boards that are similiarish to Colonists but unlike Colonists, where you place your buildings matter as some of the tiles have spatial aspects to their scoring. Logistics is completely forgone in this for better or worse, but that's fine as you have plenty to keep track of as it is.

The biggest negative for me was the rulebook. It was an absolute chore to get through. It's not that complex, but the constant "keyper", "keyp tile", "keyple", "keyp", etc got old fast and just muddied an otherwise clear rulebook.

The character edition of the game doesn't also include the regular meeples. :( I like the painted meeples, but I also like the simplistic look of the regular ones. Kind of annoyed they don't include them both, especially for the cost. If anyone is curious, the standard edition is more than adequate instead of the character edition. 

With all that being said, I really enjoyed this one. People are mistakenly comparing it to Keyflower for some reason. The only thing is really shares with it is the word Key in the title and some of the graphical design. It's not as good as it's older brother, but it's not trying to be the same like Key to the City: London was. Go into this one expecting a different game and you'll be surprised.

--You really don't wanna play this with 4, unless you enjoy a lot of downtime
-I understand how the joining creates something extra, but also creates the biggest downtime: waiting until everyone has decided if they wanna join or not
-The foldable country boards are  maybe innovative, I find the added value low, they are the second factor of downtime in this game, especially if you have some players whom suck at it, like myself :s
+You'll get a good game in the Key-series and have a lot of interesting choices to make during the game
+-Maybe it's because we were new to the game, but after a while everybody seems to be playing on 'his' country board
+While in Keyflower it's a disadvantage to be short in keyples, here it's certainly not, as the laying down of keyples can be very advantageous
+There seems to be a lot of strategies you can pursue.
++ A lot of wooden, nice components, especially the animeeples

RATING: 5.5
First impression is pretty good. The option to follow or in this case, join other players’ actions is always welcome mechanism to me, and the notion of variable worker reclamation and usage between seasons is also interesting. It’s more of a sandbox game with a lot more initial choices of tiles ala Caverna which I’m not super keen on, but the initial tiles are pretty basic so it’s not a super huge deal unless I’m playing with slow people. With that said, it has bit of a learning curve and had us referencing the rules more than few times. I can already tell, even after playing it, this one is going to be a bear to teach, most specifically the worker placement rules. The rulebook, although thorough, is dense and kind of difficult to navigate. The production as a whole is fantastic; R&D has been great with this so it’s no surprise. As of now I still looooove Keyflower more, and will forever love it more as it is a little more streamlined and intuitive. Keyper is still good, but maybe a little too bloated. Still, I'm looking forward to exploring the game.

RATING: 7
This is an efficiency game, where your goal is to build and upgrade village tiles. This is done by placing workers in action spots in the central boards. Players can also claim boards with their player color meeple, in order to gain all the meeples placed on that board for the next round, and also they can somewhat configure the action spaces on the tile to their liking, adjusting the options for the next round. Generally the flow is collect things, spend to upgrade, and try to grab new tiles from the fliplucky display that will grant you points based on what you've accumulated.

The neat thing about the game is that when a worker goes to a spot that matches his color, you get the action twice. Then someone can follow you in the action giving you both the action three times. This means that players frequently have uneven numbers of workers. When someone is out of workers, and they've already claimed a tile for the next round, they can choose to start knocking over workers to resolve their spaces again which activates them just as before, so up to three times potentially.

I think with more plays and better understanding of when you want a guy boom and when you want a guy bust there's a lot you can game the game, but the length of the game and the general equality of all things makes me feel like I'd really need to push to get this to the table enough for me to grow on it, and I don't have that in me compared to the amount the puzzle interests me.

By equality of all things I mean, there's no functional difference between the types of gems or animals or anything really. The agricola/caverna magic is that it matters what animals you have and when, for breeding, growing, ect. Veggies grow differently than grain. in Keyper, you get a red gem, or a yellow gem. Then you see if you can get a tile that wants a red gem or a yellow gem. No? Only green? Ok... 
I mean, ultimately that's fine, but it just means there's a certain dullness to the late game collection of things.

Randomness in the tile availability I don't MIND, but if there was a meaningful difference between resources then I think the game would have been a keeper for me,  I do think it's an odd decision not to pair this kind of flipluck without a general end of game leftovers scoring. If you aren't going to mandatorily release the tile that gives bonus points for chickens, at least punish me for having no chickens. Make choosing what action spots are available on the tile mean something more.

One to sink your teeth in, yet surprisingly clear from the get go. Most of this clarity is due the excellently written rulebook, with clear visual support and little ambiguity. You won't get lost. 

Surprising elements like the hexaflexagonal country boards, the shifting make-up of your meeples (keyples) and the many, many(!!!) different resources make this game a worthwhile purchase for any fan of worker-placement games. It even setups and plays quite quick, for a meaty worker placement.

One of my best and most surprising buys from Spiel 2017!

Another hit by Breese. It fits inside the "Key" universe, yet still has it's own unique feel. I love how you can follow others to make actions more powerful for both you and them balanced against the tension of claiming the boards and therefore having the meeples the next round. You've got a ton of resources and so there's a bunch of ways to victory and different things to do. The origami boards are also really interesting, and a fun way to combine a little control and replayability at the same time. Great game!

Actually, this is a really good game, I think. There is a lot of planning to do, a lot to think about. Unfortunately, I hate dealing with double sided cards/tiles where you have to flip back and forth all the time to see what you’ve got. Here, it’s even worse since there are so many different combinations possible! If not for this one incredibly annoying thing, I think I’d rate this closer to a 7.5. But according to the BGG scale, since I doubt I’ll try this again it gets a measly 3.

There is a lot of stuff going on in this game, with some excellent adaptations to the worker placement genre.  One of the best things about the game is that there is nothing that directly harms another player, you can only leave them with less optimal moves.  It took us until the beginning of summer to really begin to understand strategy for this game, and I hope to play again soon.

RATING: 6.5
Worker placement/resource conversion game with intriguing positive-sum interaction. When a player places a meeple on a field, they must invite other players to join in; if someone does, both players get additional actions. This combines with a mechanism where players are required to claim boards, keeping all meeples there for the following round, but where running out early allows re-using actions. This part is all very interesting.

Unfortunately, the rest of it. The folding boards are a gimmick and the rest of the game is uninteresting resource collection/conversion, nothing you haven't seen a thousand times before. (And that's still overselling it: it's aggressively uninteresting, all the same farming/mining/etc. buildings as Keyflower only with less competition and less interaction, options for set collection here and direct VP-to-resource conversion there.)

The central mechanisms are very good, though, and the package as a whole very smooth.

Original (2018-01-01): I'm not quite sure where to begin on describing this one. You play your Keyples (workers) on either boards shared by all players or on buildings you've built on your own board in order to gather resources and score points. I enjoyed both of my plays that I've made so far but I suppose I'm still not quite sure on how to get the most out of my workers. This left me feeling like I wasn't progressing as fast as I could have been. It's certainly fun but I suppose I'll have to get a few more plays in before it really begins to open up to me. 7/10.

Update (2018-01-13): I believe I've gotten a better handle on the game and making the most of my workers. However, shipping seems to me to be the dominate strategy if you can set it up. The games I've seen so far that hit above 90 or 100 was heavy shipping, along with some of the buildings that boost shipping. This strategy is mitigate by random building distribution but I'll have to explore the game more and see if any other strategies can go head to head with this one. Still 7/10.

tl;dr: yet another excellent game in the series

Man, Richard Breese always finds ways to cram new mechanisms into his games. Ways to do things differently from other games. But he does it in such a way that those unique elements don't call attention to themselves.
This is mostly a WP game where the color of your meeples affects the efficiency of your action. And other players can join you and then both players can benefit off of each other. Cool stuff that leads to interesting choices. Especially since every player gets to claim one of the action boards and with it all meeples (current and future) on it. Then it becomes a question of do I join in on the action I really want to do, or do I do it on an other board so I have access to the colors of meeples I want next round?
But not having a lot of meeples can be very nice as well as you get to reuse already placed meeples from yourself or (when you run out) other players.
All very interesting stuff. And that's all thrown into a game where you need to gather resources to convert into VPs because that's how games work of course.
But it's all very well done again (apart from the rule book apparently). The first game with 4 took a bit over 2 hours, but that's fine. It doesn't outstay it's welcome at all. It's engaging from start to finish.

Rating after Essen demo (not sure if I should call it a play). I can see why people like the "Key-" series, but this game is not for me. A lot of possibilities to place workers to convert stuff to stuff or get things to convert to other things. The colored meeples give you bonus actions on some fields, and each player gets the meeples of one of the boards, so the number and the colors of your meeples will change. You also build your own tableau of buildings which get you things or convert things or turn things into points. There is a lot of strategy to discover, I'm sure.

Lots of wonderful decisions and unique twists on worker placement. It makes you think about many different things and still has the same wonderful feel of a Euro puzzle game. The folding boards are a really interesting decision.

The production & illustration stellar: especially the amount of different animeeples!

A masterpiece by Richard Breese. It is very well balanced. It is better, and more open-ended than Keyflower with respect to different directions for victory. Keyflower remains my favourite game from this designer. But Keyper is better. Exceptionally clever mechanic of cooperation! So why I don't rank it above Keyflower? There are so many tiles in Keyper ... that makes strategy to need to change directions depending on what tiles are available. The spectrum of possibilities is wild in Keyper. This is a great thing for replay-ability, but it is daunting for the brain.

I generally like the Key series of games, so I was intrigued by this game. I'll just state up front that my initial play was not ideal and that's probably colored my view of the game a bit.

I saw someone setting up the game and jumped in before realizing they were trying to learn the game straight from the rulebook. Ugh. And to boot, the rulebook isn't great. Also, whoever decided to call your player pieces "keyples" and your player marker your "Keyper"... that's cute and all, but it really makes it harder to understand the rules. Anyway, we spent about 45 minutes trudging through the rules, and had a few disputes about how the rules were supposed to be interpreted. Luckily someone saw us and took pity on us and offered to teach the game, which was super quick.

I get the feeling that this game tends to run long normally, especially as there's a follow the leader mechanism at play, but our play seemed to take a really long time. I'd want to play this with three for my next play to see how long it takes with other players and at a lower play count.

The game itself has a few interesting things going on. First, there's boards sections equal to the number of players. These boards are wonky. Have you ever seen those flat folding puzzles that you can fold in an infinite number of ways? They look like oversized candy bars and each section is connected to the others by rubberbands... well the Keyper boards have a similar thing going on where you can keep folding them over and over to get different configurations of action spots on them. I'm not sure how you can keep folding them. It's some sort of origami or maybe magic for all I know. Anyway each player gets to muck around with their board until they have the action spots they want showing (although they do have to pick an orientation showing the correct season).

Then players take turns putting meeples on action spots on the board sections. You have 8 meeples (sorry, "keyples") and a "keyper" (which really should just be a marker showing your player color... although they made it look almost identical to the meeples which is easy to confuse people). The meeples come in seven colors (orange, brown, green, black, gray, blue and white). Each color (except white) is tied to a type of action spot (whites are wild).

You can use any worker to trigger any action spot, but a meeple that matches the action spot color gets an extra activation. Then in turn order every other player has a chance to join you (although only the first to say yes can actually do so). If they join you, you get an extra activation and they get as many activations as you do. So generally they want to join you, unless you're doing something they completely don't care about this round.

This brings us to the Keyper. At some point you're going to put your keyper on one of the board sections. That locks that board in as yours for the next round... and you'll get all the workers on that board. Those will be your meeples for the next round. If you place too early, no one will put meeples on that board anymore and you won't get many workers in the next round. If you wait too long to place your keyper someone else will choose to place theirs and snag a tile that has either a lot of meeples on it, or cool color meeples (or both). Once you've claimed a board section, you'll want to put all your meeples on your board section from then on (unless joining someone else is too juicy, or there's an action spot that only exists somewhere else). You can get more than 8 meeples this way... but you'll have to choose which 8 to use for the next round. The extra ones won't get you actions, but you'll get a free resource from each of them.

So it seems unfair that some people will have more meeples than others... except... well it kind of is and there's kind of a reason why it's not. After a player has placed all their meeples and their Keyper, they have no bits left to place. At that point, on their turn, they can start activating workers that have already been placed (signified by laying those meeples on their side).

Those retriggered meeples generate the same benefits as they would have originally (1 activation for an unmatched single meeple, 2 for a color-matched single meeple, 3 for a color-matched meeple that someone joined with another meeple) When a player chooses to retrigger an action spot, they must start with the action spots on the board section they claimed or on their personal player board (your personal player board is where you build all the buildings in the game, and buildings can be action spots that only you can use.) Theoretically if they trigger all of those again, they could then start trigger action spots on the board sections other players have claimed (but that seems unlikely to actually happen.)

The round ends when that last person places all his meeples and keyper. It's likely that other players have been retriggering placed workers while the last player was trying to get all their meeples played. Once that player triggers the end of the round, all the other players get to do one last retrigger. So you really want to join people when they take actions because you get a better activation for your meeple, and then you're more likely to finish all your workers/keyper before the last player and get extra actions retriggering workers.

The worst thing is to take an action, have no one join you (which means your activation is diminished) and then end up with fewer meeples placed than everyone else and be the one who ends the round and doesn't get the extra retriggering.

So what do all these action spots do? They get you raw resources, upgrade raw resources into finished goods, let you convert one raw resource into two (which might be activated up to 3 times remember), do the same for finished goods, take various types of animals, take building tiles from the display, build buildings, upgrade buildings, get gems/gold (later in the game), ship goods to a boat, etc.

Buildings come in two types. Farm type buildings primarily lets you hold up to four animals each (most buildings only hold specific types of animals) and score points for them at game end. Village buildings typically give you an action spot only you can use with some special power. Sometimes they have an immediate effect, or only provide end of game scoring. Upgraded buildings usually just do things better and score more points.

At the beginning of the game you get a goal for each of the three rounds which will score you some points if you do it. These are typically just have (not return) x, y and z. Each round players will refold their new board section determining which action spots are available. Each round new boats (equal to player count as every board section has one river) come out which either sell or buy some specific goods (money is points).

And that's it. You're trying to find a way to make points, usually through collecting animals, shipping animals/goods, or building buildings.

I generally liked the idea of the game. There were some interesting things going on... if it hadn't taken so long to learn and play, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

Essen 2017 - The rules are actually much simpler than what the rulebook, tables, and diagrams on the box suggest... which is good, because the game flows like a charm, with a 'key' flavor, enjoyable mechanics, and cool folding boards! Recommended!

Different enough from Keyflower. Following other players' actions is an interesting mechanic. The amount of meeples is not that important, as same actions can be reused once.

Medieval farming worker placement for building and goods conversion on personal player city-square/field boards with some new twists.  The multi-folding shared action boards are distinctly unique.  Use the right colored meeple at a location for an extra action. Follow actions gain a shared additional bonus action for all participants which creates a new type of advantage decision.  Taking a community action board to claim the resident meeples for the next round creates a great decision risk and value tension that provides the signature feel of the Key game series.

Nice worker placement game with original new elements. Especially the adaptable country boards, the actions of joining keyples and the ability to claim a board with the keyper. There is a lot of decisions to make. The game components are good. 
The rules however are fairly compact and sometimes hard to understand. You really need some time to study them.  And you also have to know the properties of the tiles quite well before you can play the game properly.

A continuation of concepts from Keyflower, but lacking the spatial build of the hexes from that game and here, the colors of the meeples are used for increased action potential instead of color "currency" bidding... the unique folding country boards are a highlight and the ability to "join" other players actions for increased potential for both players make this game a superb addition to the Key series...

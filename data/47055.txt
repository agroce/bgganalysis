"A wonderfully immersive scientific based rocket building game, however I fear that there isn't actually much of a game underneath and rolling a 1 early on can be the death of you. In the base game a couple of the cards are extremely powerful and first access to some of the upgraded cards can also be vital.

I sold my copy as it requires too much investment from other people in to understanding the game and I don't like it enough to get them to play it, would happily join in with another group who knew it a little and wanted to play with the expansion."

Amazing attempt at really simulating rocket flight. I love the physics in the rulebook, although the rules themselves could be better explained. Marvellous board!

Would take a lot of commitment getting to the level where this was fun. A first-- long-- game involved lots of time just figuring out how it worked, making mistakes, without doing very much. So I fear it may just sit on the shelf.

RATING: 9
I am debating with myself whether to give this a 10. 

Pros
-Very Thematic. You feel like you are in control of a space mission control. 

-Hard sci-fi (read realistic). Actually most of the game patents are not fictitious at all. Hall effect thrusters for example have been used by the soviets since the 70's. Ion thrusters have tested by NASA JPL labs since the 90's and are in use today and solar sails have already been used for space missions. 

-Mechanics convey the theme very well.

-There is a lot of replayability. There are a lot of things to discover. The game is very open ended. 

-Good solo capability. Surprisingly it can be played solo very well as a way to learn the game. 

-Good game duration. It takes about 2.5 to 3 hours to play a full game with 2-3 players. With more i suppose it adds to about 20 mins per additional player. 

Cons.
-Prone to luck. Sometimes a lucky roll might win you the game or an unlucky roll lose it for you.

-The rules, as the come out of the box are not written in a clear and concise way. I Recommend that you download the "Alive and Complete rules".

-Very steep learning curve. The game is not that complex but it gives you no clue as to what the best way to achieve victory is. This open-ended design is both a plus and a minus. New players are at a loss as to what to do and veterans simply deduct what the best course of action is, based on the available patents. The hard part is getting from newbie to experienced...

-The game doesn't feel that complete without the expansion.

Overall: A very good brain burner. It takes a while to attune to the game, but once you do. It plays like a breeze. A must have for space or astronomy enthusiasts.

this game hurts my brain.  it is distinctly possible that i am not smart enough to play it, but it is such an incredible game that i'm willing to keep making myself feel stupid over and over again.  the board, just by itself, is one of the most intriguing and beautiful game designs i've ever seen. the pieces are simple, clean and unremarkable (with the exception in the latter case of the 50s style rocketship), so you don't get distracted from the beauty and insane complexity of the board(s).

I learned all the rules and played through most of a game. I regretted it. While the rules aren't as hard as people make it out to be, the game just isn't that great. Things like overly busy spaceship cards make it really hard to follow. No visual guides explain certain things so you are always reliant on the rulegiver to explain things. And finally the mechanic wasn't all that greatly executed.

This is science adventure first and game second.  I love playing this out as a study in (on opinion on) the economics of building extra-terrestrial mining/manufacturing outposts, but as a competitive game I think it suffers from being too long and too luck-driven.  Highly recommended as long as you aren't expecting a well-tuned set of euro-style game mechanics: the theme defines the mechanics here.

Much improved by (some parts of) the expansion.

11/8/13: Played with 4, after the game has been out for a couple of years.  Much better experience.  I still think that it's a situation where there isn't much chance for catchup if you're behind, but it's still a very enjoyable experience.  Raised my rating to an 8.

One of the hardest rulebooks to get through that I've read in a long time.  I think that more examples would help.  Fortunately things seem to fall in place with your first play.

Not a game that I'd recommend for most people, because of the high science/geek factor, and it is more of a simulation than a game.  

You do need to get a good start.  If you can't get traction early, there isn't a good way to catch up.  My first play was with 2, and I think that it would be best with 3 or 4.

A game like no other. Designed for seasoned gamers ready to spend at least two games learning the "basics" of a basic game. Very hard to explain, with a long learning curve, but that's because there really is some kind of an "exploring" aspect to this game that is totally original. You'll have to trial and error combinations of cards, explore sites and rebuild spacecraft/outpost, while having bluff/trading and space race interactions. After a 4 hour game you'll be exhausted for sure!

I do like the sensation of outspace. I like making colonies and exploring planets. I also like that all the job you have made can be useless by crassing your rocket. the bad point of the game is that you need the map expansion to get the real felling of the game and that is to long, can be much more than 6 hours, endless.

This game has an extremely high learning curve and requires a substantial investment of time and mental energy. A fair knowledge of scientific knowledge is also a plus. That said, it is worth the effort. The last time I had this much fun just tooling around the solar system is when I first played Tripanetary in the late '70s. This game takes things to a whole new level as you research technologies and plot out the best routes to reach the resources of the planets and asteroids, all the while competing/cooperating with other factions. Just fantastic in so many ways, and all the technology is real or theoretically possible. Who ever said hard science was boring?!

Amazingly brutal. I enjoy this game, but not as much as his earlier simulation game, American Megafauna. The main reason being, in AM only one player needs to know the entire rule set to keep the clockwork going. With how obtuse the (basic) rule set is for most gamers, spending 15-20 minutes teaching players and then fielding questions/reminders most of the game has been increasingly frustrating for me. I'd like someday to play the advanced game with all experienced players.

Very interesting game.  The "chrome" is great for just geeking out, but can make learning the game daunting.  Key is to ignore the chrome while learning, the actual game mechanics are pretty straight forward.  Each game does take awhile to get going and you need several playings before it all gells, but then look out!

I can't really give this a rules summary because I don't know the rules.

I really wanted to like this game. It looked cool(the card diagrams and the map which was poster sized thanks to Rusty's BGG hookup. Heck he even had 3D printed bits) and the idea behind it is friggin awesome. Who doesn't want to build a space program and explore the solar system? People who are dead inside, that's who.

Unfortunately this game is probably the closest I've felt to the nightmare that was Seafall. It's fine at first, then as the game plays you realize it's just an exercise in tedious play with no player interaction. You pick your plan and just build to it. The auction is suppose to allow players to interact, but bidding never gets to a point where it is truly painful to over pay. Player hand limit also meant that eventually just passing on auctions eventually leads to you getting something useful enough to power your project at a cheap price.

Now, I've been told multiple times  "You only played the basic game. It's meant to teach you to crawl so you can play the full game. There are modules that get added, including one that allow you to blow up other people's ships." To that my response is simple. The basic game has to have something going for it, otherwise why would anyone want to play the more advanced version? Because potentially it won't be a slow crawl where you feel life being stolen from your body? That sounds like a gamble I'm not willing to take, and I'm fairly risky... I've eaten a Costco hot dog and slice of pizza in the same sitting. 

This is a conversation I had about the attacking module(paraphrased);
"There is no player interaction."
"There is player interaction. In the advanced game you can blow up people's ships."
"So you can just build a Death Star going around terrorizing the board like a space pirate?"
"No, all the rockets have missiles and lasers."
"So it's not a viable strategy to win, it's a crime of opportunity?"
"No, you blowing up someone else's ship can prevent them from winning, allowing you to win"
"But wouldn't I need to waste my turns to fly to the person to blow them up, setting my own projects back and probably ending my chances of winning?"
"No, it's the exact opposite of what you are saying, because everything you say makes it sound like it's crap."

The play of other players has very little actual meaning to you, other then it gives you a better story; "I built a factory on Mars and colonized the moon before NASA could drill the Milky Way." Without that story the walls come crashing down as you realize you spent two and a half hours playing a simple math pickup and delivery game.  There is an auction mechanic thrown in that slows the game rather then causing tough decisions(but does give a reason to look at the sweet ass cards.) It really feels like a solo game that allows you to have other people be seated in close proximity without it being weird. 

Bottom line; It's a game for people that don't have friends... but want people to think they might. It's not the worst game I've ever played(that's a really low bar), but I wouldn't be too bummed if I never play it again.

difficult

intense. We played 2 marathon games of this recently. Great! Rules take a while...though.
Rules book could use some better writers and maybe illustrations. 

This game did however, teach me how not to read a rules book. When it says: see 5.1 or whatever, don't see 5.1. At least not in your first read through.

Someone definitely needs to make a thorough rules teaching video based upon the base game for those of us who might require visual aids in learning. As everyone learns differently.

Cool game though. I wish I could play it more.

A really complex game with a harsh learning curve, and one that is fairly punitive of poor choices. The early game is dominated by getting very heavy mass off-planet as fast as possible, but once you have a factory in an asteroid cluster it shifts to getting as many factories or manned missions completed as possible as fuel and components become "cheaper". A great game with a lot of depth and many winning strategies (it's more of a sandbox sim than a strategy game).

It's all about efficiency - making your money/fuel work for you in the best way possible, and picking the components for your rocket to keep weight low and function high. Would definitely play again.

Not even trying to be a game.  What is with the limp technology auction?  Why does so much hinge on a few die rolls?  It's kind of interesting once, but far too complicated for that kind of experience play.  I mean there are rules for outposts and shuttles that seem to add very little and the rulebook is just a mess.  There are wargames of far more complexity that were orders of magnitude easier to understand.

RATING: 7
A fascinating game of mission planning and resource management. I'd suggest short scenarios for new players before taking them into a full-blown game. There are a lot of play aids, but they aren't intuitive and are marginal in the role they serve. The cards for the various elements of the rocket stack I think need to be redesigned so players understand more about how they fit together so they can play the game than trying to explain in tiny type and jargon just what the thing IS.

I really like the premise, but we played wrong.  It would have been nice for the board to include a couple more pieces per player (an outpost and freighter piece).  I want to play this again, hopefully correctly this time.

This is an extremely well designed game using "known" technology to create a sci-fi 'realistic' exploration of the solar system. This is not a game for me. There is an enormous amount of forethought in the first half a dozen turns in order to succeed in this game. Even with experienced help, I got it wrong twice, traveling to and from a specific destination three times, when I could have done it once. All of which required something like thirty turns of the game. I hate to say it was 4 1/2 hours wasted as I enjoyed the company immensely. But I don't need to play this game again in the future.

RATING: 10
Couple comments now that I've played this quite a bit (although not with the expansion yet):

- My rating is for the "quickstart" game, where you deal one technology from each pile to each player. This should have been standard. There is no reason to start with 4 WT and no technology - it just takes too long to get going. If you've been playing that way, your gaming experience will be vastly improved with this rule.
- The comments about how difficult this game is are, in my opinion, overblown. The core systems are actually quite reasonable. Is putting together missions hard? Sure. But Brass, Antiquity, and Age of Steam are all tricky too and High Frontier isn't *that* much harder. High Frontier isn't gratuitously punishing, just pay attention, understand ISRU and how to land and take off, and realize your first game is a learning game. It's not crazy long - 2-2.5 hr - as long as players stay focussed and keep moving at a reasonable clip. Some experience will bring it down probably to under 2.
- 5 players is probably one too many. 3 or 4 is fine.
- OK, the auction isn't great. The play advice in the rulebooks suggests you should buy and sell technology to get WTs, but it's just wrong - if all you want to do is get WTs, just take one for your operation. It's a lot faster and the results are slightly better. Don't auction unless you want the technology, think you can sell it to someone else for 2+, or need to cycle the cards (to get at something to use as a factory product most likely). The game works better if you don't try to game the auctions as an income stream.
- Yes, you can get hosed by the dice. But this is not AMF or Origins - the risk are reasonable, given space exploration is hazardous, and you have plenty of options for mitigating them. High Frontier isn't a game you'd ever play for money or blood, but good players win.
- I really object to the folks who say that High Frontier has put the simulation ahead of the game. This is certainly generally true of Sierra Madre's games, but High Frontier is different. This is a real game in which the complexities of space exploration have been distilled down to a few highly playable game systems. It's a challenging game, it's an authentic game, it's a game based on a lot of science (and also plenty of speculation), but it's also a well-designed, playable game.
- And I'll say it again, don't play with the expansion until you've got a firm handle on the base game - 3 or 4 plays. The base game is a plenty rich game on its own. If you try to throw in the expansion before you've mastered the basics, the game will overwhelm you most likely and not be fun.
---
This has really grown on me. I was biased towards liking it, but it has nonetheless exceeded expectations. It's not without some flaws; the early game is too slow, and too much time is spent taking a water to get your stuff into orbit. But the design of the map is totally brilliant, I think they've done a good job of designing the thrusters, robonauts, and refineries to be quite different but pretty well balanced, and the game is very challenging in an interesting and evocative way. It seems to be of sensible length end just at the right time. By far the best Sierra Madre game I've played.

Still: Use the fast setup (where everyone gets some stuff out of the gate). Do NOT attempt the expanded game unless ALL players have several (probably 3+) games under their belt. Seriously, don't do it. And realize that it's still a Sierra Madre game, which means it's richly thematic and scientifically edgy, but you can play a highly skillful game and come in last because you blew some critical die rolls, couldn't get the right technology, or whatever. The thing is, in High Frontier, there is always stuff to do and missions to plan. You may be stuck passing to get water, but even if you are, you are usually doing so towards achievable goals that are in your sights, which was not always the case in Origins or American Megafauna, where you could sometimes be screwed and without good options.

Last thing: Orange's special power is pretty lame in the basic game. I think the game plays best with 3 or 4 anyway, so I'd recommend just cutting them out (the PRC, while aggravating, makes for a more interesting playing experience and more interesting game).
---
Chris' top tip: I strongly recommend playing the "quick-start" version in which everyone gets one card from each deck for starters. Otherwise I think the early game develops too slowly for new players. I also recommend, in the strongest possible terms, not playing the Expanded game until you have several games of the "basic" game under your belt. The split is a touch awkward - I wish the "slingshot" rules were in the basic game, without which the solar sails seem pretty hard to use - but the basic game is hard enough. High Frontier has a theory about how space will be developed economically, and you need to understand that theory as well as the problems with gravity before you can move on to the much more complex expanded game.
---
I enjoyed this, but be warned it's a classic Sierra Madre Game: very flavorful, well-researched, evocative, and yet it often feels like you don't really have that much control, you're just going with the flow of events. I think it's going to take probably two plays for most people to feel like they're exerting sufficient control for a game of this length, and for the pacing to feel right. After just the one play, it feels a lot more stable and interesting than Origins did (and I even liked Origins, sort of), and I have hopes for this one. But, Sierra Madre games are always a bit dicey. In particular, the availability and flow of patents in this one feels pretty random, and I hope it works.

I highly recommend the basic game, and additionally the short version, for your first play.

Also like most SMG games, it's fun just to contemplate and look at all the thought that went into it. The map layout and movement system in particular is incredibly clever. Sure, it seems insanely unlikely you'd ever go to Venus in an actual game for any reason. But just to look at it and see the care that went into modeling something you'll never use, and how you *might* do it and what technology would be required is cool.

RATING: 2
My rating doesn't really reflect the quality of the game, as there's definitely an efficiency/planning game here that obviously a lot of careful work went into crafting.  However, the barrier to entry was just set way too high for me for the enjoyment I got out of the game.

I tend to prefer games where I can make my decisions quickly without having to calculate every minutiae.  Heck, I play some fairly heavy games that way and do well.  However, you can't play this game that way.  When you launch a rocket, you have to have an exact plan for it which involves a fair bit of calculation and complexity to do correctly.  My tolerance for that sort of thing maxes out in games like Antiquity (which is in my top 10).  This game is just too overboard for me in that respect.

This game could also be immensely helped by someone tacking the rulebook and rewriting the rules from the ground up.  There's a playable game here that's completely masked underneath scientific jargon and overall poor organization.  I understand all of the careful attention that went into making this game into more of a simulation.  However, I just want to play the dang game... I don't care at all how all of this stuff correlates to real life physics.  I feel like perhaps the effect here is as more of an art piece than a playable game, although with some minor streamlining and rules rewriting, it would be a very playable game.

Overall, I very much admire the effort that went into this.  It's just not something I would ever even think of playing again.

Crisp, stupidly satisfying space exploration game based on an astounding time-energy map of the inner solar system.

The auction for technology has depth, a tight turn structure keeps play ticking along nicely, and sharp victory conditions - certainly in the basic game - prevent it from ever turning into a marathon.

Likely prescient economics-meets/and-physics simulation of the (hopefully) coming solar system industrialization space-race. Possibly the greatest difficult modern game yet created. Tons of activity at the yahoo group.

Loving the rules, the map, working on miniatures. Not the biggest fan of the cover art - a bit too obscure, would have loved a shot of Earth with a space elevator, or busy Luna colony with Earth rise.

(Initial impressions here; lot of hyperbole...I need to revisit my review after a few more plays.)

UPDATE: So good it gives me panic attacks! Like ASL, High Frontier engages my imagination in a way that other games do not. This, this, is what I want from games: an imaginative journey, an education, and mind-expanding inspiration. This is why I play games.

First play. Five players, four newbies. We didn't finish and I spend most of the game on Earth trying to figure out what the heck to do after a poorly-planned trip to the moon went awry. But holy shit! I freaking loved it! Perhaps the most conceptually tricky board game I've ever played...figuring out what to do is challenging as hell. This is the first time I've encountered such open-world in a board game. Straight up 10 for that if no other reason. The thematic integration and what seems (to my unscientific mind) to be some very real science in the design and chrome makes this a 10 for sure. It has just enough Euro in it to be playable, but beats the shit out of you as a space-travel game ought to. Careful though, this is not a game for everybody...especially those who don't get a sick thrill out of being kicked in the nuts repeatedly by a board game or who prefer not to invest the brain power and time it takes to figure things out. I get it, I've been there myself with other games, but HF is something special.

HF is my type of game: immersive as all get out, beautiful (not merely the breathtaking wtf? board, but in the overall design), strategic (yeah, there's luck and chaos, but that's life), and educational (yes, a little didactic maybe...I'm fine with it). It isn't really simulation, but rather a game that captures the 'feel' of what its trying to simulate through simplification and purification. What you're left with is playable game that tells you something about space travel and gives you a sense for what a challenge and accomplishment it would be to travel out into our solar system. 

This is not a 'teach the rules and lets play in a couple hours (correctly)' style of game. It requires a fairly dedicated group willing to work through the frustration of figuring out what to do. The one complaint I have is with the rules, which are simultaneously good and bad, is that they could be a little more explicit and better organized. They include a depth of cool scientific info and seem to be complete, but they really could be more clear and explicit. I understand the value in letting your players figure things out...High Frontier is a sandbox in that way and part of the fun is realizing all of the cool stuff that you can do in the game, but there is no reason not to be a little clearer about what exactly one is trying to accomplish and how the various tools interact (I'm still not sure why I would want a freighter). Minor complaints though...I could see this game getting a ton of play if I can find the right players. In many ways this is my "dream game"--I've been looking for something like this for a long time.

=========================================================

I'm shitting myself to play this game ASAP. The rules, surprise, could use a rewrite, and a de-jargonizing but the topic is so juicy I'm willing to forgive it. Fired up as all get out to figure this sucker out. Reading rules now...

I sold this to my gaming group as "the game that makes gamers run for the hills."  They were interested.

I just wish the rulebook was better written, to alleviate the learning curve.  I'm convinced the game is easier than the rules would indicate.  Maybe I'll have to eat these words once we actually try a full game (we've only dabbled in a "to the mooon and back" mode).

Oh, and I bought the enlarged solar system map from Zazzle, during one of Zazzle's numerous sales.  Very pretty! Very daunting!

RATING: 4
High Frontier is not a good game and I am honestly shocked that it’s ranked in the top 100 here on BGG. My low rating is caused by various factors:
It is way too long for what it is (granted, we played with 5 players and 2 of us were new and didn’t really understand the game until halfway through the game). Now, if there were interesting things to do on your turn it wouldn’t be so bad, but I don’t think there are much to do during the game. I had planned a more long-term strategy, but I only just managed to build 2 factories; so actually you don’t get to do too much in the game. This is something I should be aware of the next time I’m playing it (and yes, even though I’ve rated it poorly, I’m planning on playing it one more time just to be completely sure that I didn’t miss anything in my initial assessment).

Eklund’s games seem to involve a ton of rules, and this game was no exception. I’ve played heavier games before, but they have all had more streamlined rules I think. In High Frontier, there are a lot you need to keep track of; the fuel, mass, the thrusters, waterdrops on planets etc. – and then, of course, the very confusing map with tons of little icons (especially in the outer solar system; actually I’m not sure if we played with the old map or included the expansion). This game is extremely busy and certainly not newbie-friendly!

I’m usually a fan of individual player powers, but in this game it was a little lame as they didn’t seem balanced; I was the Japanese in the basic game with 5 players which I was told was really bad… I didn’t get to use their special ability a single time (because we were 5 players in the auctions), whereas the other nations used their abilities at least once, and the experienced Chinese player used his ability to win (with me coming in second, which I had definitely not expected). But that was probably because the other very experienced player at our table lost his planet to the Chinese so that he had to spend the next 2 hours or so doing practically nothing important as he wasn’t able to win…

I wasn’t particularly fond of the fact that you can make deals but not keep them; this seems like an odd mechanic in this game in particular, but maybe it’s just because I don’t like this mechanic in games in general. 
It’s an unforgiving game and you need to plan ahead. But I think of it more like a “thematic simulation” rather than a game.

There are very few ways of scoring point – perhaps too few?! This is normally not something I criticize, but it felt like there weren’t a whole lot to do in the game regarding getting points. It’s not that I love Feld’s point salad games, but in High Frontier it seemed like we spent a lot of time on many other things and then calculated the few points we got after the game. I forgot what it’s called, but the points for going to the science planet close to the sun is an easy way of getting point, but you can also found colonies far away from the sun on some of the better planets which nobody else has and therefore score 8 points (this was actually what the winning player did in my game, and he won with a score of just 18 points, so 8 is a lot).

The biggest reason I didn’t like the game is the random dice rolls. Now, I’m perfectly fine with random dice rolls in shorter game, but not in games that lasts for 3-4-5 hours… What kind of awful rule is it that you can lose your ship if you roll poorly?! Then you’re basically doomed… It’s totally out of line with the time commitment this game requires and this is the major reason I didn’t like the game; I do NOT want such a long game to be decided due to a bad throw of the dice…

So, overall I found the game to last way too long, having some balancing issues, having a confusing map and a lot of random dice rolls which can destroy your plans due to an unlucky die roll which is absurd considering how long it takes to play.

High Frontier is an intriguing simulation, but not an engaging game.  It takes a long time to play and some will feel the game's rewards are eclipsed by its mechanical drudgery.

At its best, High Frontier makes you think, has a good theme, and avoids being a Euro cookie cutter.  It educates players about our planetary system and the technologies that may allow us to explore it.  However, most of the game is drudgery, uninteresting mechanically and without incremental rewards.  The Bang for the Buck just isn't here.

It's not that the rules are difficult.  Rather, High Frontier, while a decent simulation, is simply not a very good game.  Imagine those educational "games" you played back in middle school, the ones which despite being a welcome break from the monotony of classwork, you never thought to play at home.  High Frontier has balance issues with the relative utility of the technologies it portrays, relies on often critical die rolls, and has mechanics which can be described as "crude".  

Design highlights include the map and the player mat.  The player mat is visually cluttered, but once you 'get the point", it is a really useful tool in visualizing the fuel / weight tradeoffs that your spacecraft face.

The map is fantastic, both artistically and functionally.  It is very educational and again, once you "get it", it enables you to visualize complex concepts at a glance.  

Sadly, much of the remaining game isn't interesting.  You spend what seems like hours moving around bingo chips.  Do you like auctions?  Well prepare to be underwhelmed, auctions here are rudimentary and without nuance.  Worse, they in no way simulate how technological innovations are actually developed.  The game had a real chance to give players an appreciation for how challenging the development of new technologies is and how rewarding ... but instead an external source magically creates technologies which players then bid on in a completely unsatisfying way.

The game's pacing, particularly in the early game, is insanely slow, and worse, one's choices are often constrained, based upon the technologies that happen to present themselves.  

When you advance to the point of actually launching your mission ... there is real tension imparted by several critical die rolls.  This is the fun part of the game, the payoff for all that drudgery.  Yet life in space is unkind, and you may find that you have just spent the last hour of your *real* life preparing for a couple die rolls.  This may be realistic, but it *will* turn off gamers who dislike investing significant time and effort in games of chance.

What killed High Frontier for me is that it simply doesn't deliver enough of a reward, not enough Bang for the Buck.  It certainly fails to engage players early and often with incremental challenges and rewards.  High Frontier has a great theme and a gorgeous map.  At its best, it can be tense and educational, but for the vast majority of a session it's boring and mechanically repetitive.


So I'm not sure how to rate High Frontier.  It has some balance issues, severe pacing problems, and a dependence on luck that is completely out of line with the time commitment it demands.  It might deserve a 2.  However a 4 better reflects how I feel about the title in that I wouldn't mind exploring it more.  Of course, if I have two hours to spend gaming there are dozens of games I'd rather play.

Full disclosure, my "group" consists of three engineers all of whom develop new technologies, one of who specializes in the design of spacecraft.  We are experienced gamers who often enjoy wargames and other "simulations".

I've spent some more time with this game so I feel comfortable giving it a preliminary rating.  HF has a lot going for it.  It's rife with theme and good game play choices.  I could imagine the rating going up but it's going to take more time on my end.  I'd love to give the expanded game a shot as well.

Update: four plays later and I finally feel like the game is opening up to me.  I still don't really know what I'm doing, but I'm fluent enough in the game to launch more successful missions than not.  The expanded map (even with just the basic cards) is a huge help in introducing players to the system.  Hell, even the expanded cards are worth it.  I've yet to play with more than three but our two and three player adventures have always been tense and interesting.  

Update at 10 plays:
I'm bumping this game up.  This game may unseat Origins as my favorite Eklund.  It is simply brilliant.

There is no way to adequately express how cool that is.

Rating after one play: 

In hindsight, I realize that this was not a good choice for BOGA gamenight. Too long and too involved to be explained and played in a busy setting such as BOGA. I let my excitement about this game take control of me and I pushed for it to be played. I now realize that we probably would all have had a better time bringing this to the table on a meaty game night at Nathan's or Steve's and Bess' place.

Now about the game: no surprises here from my side, I loved it, even given the suboptimal setting and rules explanation we had. I am an aerospace engineer and space buff to begin with and I am simply amazed how this game manages to immerse me in the theme of space exploration and exoglobalization. This is a very harsh game! Mistakes are severely punished out there in cold space. You forgot to take enough lander fuel with you? Go decomission! Burned up during the Venus atmospheric approach? Go decomission! You did not manage to prospect 10 1-site claims in a row? Get yourself a raygun and stop bitching!

I love the game for what it is, which to me seems to be foremost a good simulation. I can understand any criticism about game balance, but I would have to remind you that this game was not necessarily designed with game balance in mind. There seem to be some clearly better strategies than others, but then again, everyone is invited to pursue them.

My mind kept racing about this game all night long. I would love to try this again, now that we all got the hang of the rules a little bit better. Now that we know the rules, I seriously cannot see why this would take more than 3 hours to play. Maybe one or two more base games before diving into the full expansion game experience. I hope that you are not too "turned off" by it to give it another shot.

Update: after 5 plays, this becomes a 10 for me. It's not the most elegant, not the most euroesque experience out there, but certainly the most thematic game out there. Of course, I am biased having studied aerospace engineering. Some call it "NASA in a box". For me, it is a great sandbox game.

Not for Wimps.

If you're looking for a light game- go away.
If you're looking for a game with a 'catch up' mechanism- go away.
If you're looking for a game with 'low luck' (and don't understand what that really means)- go FAR away.

If, on the other hand, you're looking for a playable game about Space Colonization that holds NOTHING BACK- where what the player is able to control has hardly any luck at all, but woe to the person who is unable to plan...

And if you're looking for a game that is an economic simulation on a level seldom seen outside of wargames...

And if you're looking for a game that is more than just 'thematic'- it will actually TEACH YOU something about its subject....

And if you're looking for a game who by a designer who is the ONLY person in the Buisness who (in my humble opinion) deserves the approbation of 'artist' because his games truly are a reflection of the world (as seen by Mr. Eklund)

Then run, do not walk, to your FLGS and DEMAND that they carry this game.  But get it with the Expansion- you're not really playing High Frontier without it.

Very impressive space mission simulation, but there's not much game here. I guess it's a race to score a certain amount of prestige, but it's more of a sandbox to try different space exploration missions in. In my first game, I successfully landed humans on Mars and returned them to Earth with a little coaching from an experienced player and some help from the European Space Agency. Then, I landed on the Moon and created a moonbase. It was glorious. Maybe next time I'll mine the asteroid belt? Like Tales of Arabian Nights, it seems more rewarding to play it for the experience than to try to win.

This is Phil Eklund's masterpiece, some 30 years in the making. It also marks the arrival of Sierra Madre Games into the professional level of game components, which began with an earlier & equally groundbreaking design, Origins. There is a lot of detail & interplay of game mechanics, participation between players, strategy and overall a lot of replayability. The game is supported at Boardgamegeek.com and also at the Yahoo Groups listed above. 

I am a big fan of SMG's Origins, and it took me a little while to become thoroughly acquainted with it, but this one is now my favorite of the 2.  Bravo, Phil!

Tentative rating after two games. Fascinating, educational, and utterly different. Rating may go down (or up) with more plays, but this is one cool work of art (or should I say science!).
Strongly recommend people read Phirax's 8 part walkthrough before attempting the game, and bring that same sense of humor to their first few games -you will need it for your mistakes. What do you mean I can't escape the gravity well of the planet? Oh well, I guess we are establishing a permanent space colony then!

Update - raised rating to 10(for the advanced game with expansion), with the advanced rules it is a brilliant game. Basic game you can really see balance issues after a few places. There are always tradeoffs in the advanced game. This is right up there, with the greatest games, and I see myself bringing it out many years from now. Only downside to game is finding opponents for a game that takes a few plays to master and requires you to overcome the natural frustrations that come from making so many mistakes.

Update: After a dozen or more playes, rating is a 9 gain. Having not yet played with the patent trading cards, which may improve it again. Don't get me wrong, this is a special game. Unique almost in its scientific realism. I will always enjoy playing it, I'm just not obsessing about it like I do most of my 10s.  AoS is likely up next for a downgrade...

This is the best of Phil's designs in my opinion. It uses the familiar idea of bidding on cards that offer resources, with tight income. But the beauty of this game is in the way that the elements fit the theme. While bidding "DNA" for dinosaur functions is OK (and the Megafauna is definitely interesting) bidding research funds to pull off the design of a new piece of science kit is much more convincing (the intellectual space race is fuelled with research cash). And the actual space flight planning is a great experience - a real sense of intrepid travel into the far unknown as a fragile solar sail swings past Earth on a fly by out to the far frontiers. All of Phil's games reveal a deep passion for their subject, but this one combines the learning with a tight rule set that actually answers all the questions. Great fun, tense, absorbing and fascinating.

This game is a hard SF space industrialization game. It's supposedly very accurate and definitely feels like it is. It also has a lot of strategic depth, even if some random elements are included.

Tentative rating after two plays of the Basic game. Not entirely sure what to make of it yet. It has very interesting theme and mechanics, but I can't help but feel it could have been simplified.

I can't disagree with the comments of Iain K too much, especially the bidding. I also agree with Chris F. that the quickstart ought to be the standard way to play. Like [i]Iron Dragon[/i], this is a game where I would only play "friendly" games because of the necessary pre-planning, i.e. players are allowed to correct small mistakes mid-route if possible. Otherwise the game will become very unfun very quickly.

I can't help but think that this game would be vastly improved by the likes of, say, Martin Wallace.

I really want to like euro games but most often don't because i want to feel like im doing the thing the theme says i am. Most euros offer the promise of being an industrialist or a city manager and instead present a clever but dull cube manipulations system that gets you 'points'.

High Frontier delivers its theme to the max. It is also the best use of a dice i have ever seen in a game. every time you roll you sit in mission control and cross your fingers. This game really makes me feel like a NASA mission planner. On top of this it is competitively sound.

High Frontier was a game that I flat-out didn't want to play.  That said, I don't like being 'the Game Dictator' and told my friend if he would play Troyes (since he doesn't seem to be the most fussy on it) with me, I would play High Frontier the next time we had 3 people, since it's supposed to be best with 3.  When the fated day came, I offered that if he were to cancel our game of High Frontier that he could veto any 3 games in my collection from being played when he was around but would fulfill my promise if he would prefer.  He wanted to play High Frontier and we did.  Beyond not really having any idea of what would be a good strategy or even exactly how to get VP, I didn't even really understand how to play the game from the explanation.  Needless to say, I didn't really enjoy myself despite coming in second place.  I'm sure I could understand this game with more plays and reading the rulebook myself but, I'm not really into playing many uber-complex games.  I don't mind having one or two long/heavy/complex games that I can focus on understanding but when exposed to too many, I find they cannibalize each others time on the table and makes them less enjoyable.  As for actual comments on the game: I found the components to be of lower quality and the board itself was, as my friend put it, 'a clusterfuck of visual information.'  I liked the look of the board in spite of how busy it was.  To me, it felt as though designer made the game with more of an intent to teach people about this area of science than to actually put together mechanisms that would lead to an enjoyable/fun gaming experience.

I LOVE the theme!  The game is complex, but not complicated, meaning it's pretty easy to learn the mechanics of the game, but the strategy is opaque and the "what do I do?" factor is high for new players.  Expect to play 1-2 games before you truly understand what's going on.  That's not a bad thing, as this game rewards repeat play, and I'm really going to enjoy exploring the depth here.  A wonderful experience.

This is a game that is dripping with theme.  There's a ton of luck, of course, but it's a game about space exploration, so there ought to be luck.  There's a lot of skill, too.  And I can say there's a puzzle-like aspect (I don't usually think in those terms, but clearly it exists here.)

After my first game, my thoughts were that someone took everything I hate from Race for the Galaxy and mashed it with all the really annoying bits from American Megafauna. And added a board with all sorts of crazy ejaculations on it.

There's no need for the unnecessary business of everything. The movement spaces on the board and the cards simply have too much on them. I know we're supposed to think the designer is smart, and I have no doubt he is, but please - simplicity is smart design.

The decisions you need to know to make before you start on any sort of journey aren't evident at all - everyone around the table told me that with more experience, you understand how everything is clear. Sorry, but having to ask about every decision I make and having to continually retcon things I did five turns ago aren't going to make me want to play this enough to grasp what's going on. 

A game needs something that sucks you in - even if you're crappy at it or don't quite get it at first. Most games offer this, or they don't get played again. Unfirtunately, High Frontier falls into the "never again" category. 

High Frontier fails as a game (which is also true of American Megafauna) but where AM succeeds as a simulation to a decent degree, I have serious doubts about HF. While I am not enough of an expert (but have more-than average knowledge) on space and space travel to say for sure, phrases on the packaging like, "they can only be built in the zero-gravity and high-vacuum conditions in space" while making *Venus* a destination for factories doesn't add up in my mind. Or that the gravity between it and the moon even fall into the same ballpark... really makes you think...

Meh with a capital "M".

You know how folks will tell you "Hurry up with your turn, it's not ROCKET SCIENCE!"

THIS game IS Rocket Science.  Not for the faint of heart nor for those who are looking for a quick filler between games.  This will take you a good four hours or so, but if you love rocketry, astronomy, mathematics, or science in general, this is a very enjoyable way to spend an evening.

The game says what it says it wants to accomplish; and then goes out and does it brilliantly. Most games don't have anything to say or even a point. Those that do often fall short. This is an excellent game from a small publisher.

The non-wargame I love to play most.
I don't care about the ever-changing rules, though. The problem is that they tend to get more complicated and more and more exceptions are introduced, instead of the rules being streamlined. Maybe I'll just forget about the internet and play HF as "printed in the book" for the rest of my life.
Also the components (mostly from the base game) do not "keep pace" with the rules. There is only space for on outpost stack on the players mat, which is used for either bernal/ersatz-bernal/Leo, no way to track the different types of fuel which can be loaded into the rocket. Further, with so many possible moves and operations (colonists) per turn, there should be a way to track what element already moved / did its operation. Especially as moves and operations can now be freely mixed. I sometimes use glass beads for this, but most games have some elegant mechanics "built in" to track such things.

I like Phil Eklund. Really, I do. Origins is probably the most random game I've ever enjoyed. 

This, though, is an incredibly tedious game. 

Par for Eklund, it teaches some interesting lessons: it takes an unbelievable amount of time, energy and expense just to get off the ground, nevermind into an orbit. Traveling in space is hard, and even if you manage to get your ship into space, you probably won't find anything worth the trip.

Unlike Origins, though, the gameplay that backs up the lesson just doesn't offer any thrills. The game feels like treading water, largely due to chance.

I'll probably regret selling this off some day, but I was not impressed.

•	Educational with accurate simulations
•	Beautiful and unique board that is also very functional
•	The start is extremely slow and un-engaging 
•	The auction is weak
•	Mechanics are repetitive and torturously slow  (It takes an extraordinary number of turns to accumulate enough before you can make a meaningful decision on where to go--and these decisions last only a few turns and then you are back to sitting and accumulating again for another astronomical number of turns.)
•	Dice determine critical outcomes
•	The rules are confusing and exhausting
This game is a minimum of 2 hrs. (and the first game can take up to 4), and doesn't deliver enough gaming rewards for my time investment.

High Frontier is an absolute masterpiece.  If you're at all interested in the idea, it's an automatic buy for the educational value alone, the expansion as much so. It's just fascinating with tons and tons of technical information not even relating to the game.  The interactive nature of a game does for me what many books would likely not.

So what if you're ambivalent on the theme; is the game itself any good?  I've only been able to play the basic game with 2 players so far, but the answer is it's definitely good, possibly much more so.  I think with experienced players the game will move at a nice clip with some interesting dynamics regarding the technologies and races to get to particular sites.  There are some nuances to the different factions and in the expanded game political actions seem like they could really get interesting.  As players graduate from the basics, negotiations, and political actions look to really make things shine.  

Many have commented on the difficulty of completing any mission at all.  I think that's pretty overstated.  It's a simple calculation to ensure success with a couple "gotchas" that are easy to forget, but really it's just a matter of getting used to what you have to calculate.  After that, it's really trying to balance what techs you've got with appropriate available missions.  

The real problem is absorbing the system on a single rules explanation.  This is the sort of game where having people introduced to the system before you even begin is going to be extremely helpful.  I highly recommend suggesting players read the walkthrough in the files section that doesn't read like a rulebook and will keep people's attention without having the game in front of them.  The expansion adds significantly more overhead, so you've got no choice but to stick with the base game until people have played at least 2 games fairly close together.

This game is deep, has confusing rules, and there are a lot of rules. I think the mechanics are easy enough to understand, it's just the number of options and how you accomplish your goal that gets frustrating. I think I'll enjoy this on a second play through, for now I don't want to see the box for at least a week.

Certainly the most unique theme in my collection.  Hard science combined valiantly with game mechanics to create an "experience" game that teaches a little bit of interstellar physics and the hard realities of space travel.  Not sure how much it will get played as it can be completely brain melting in its execution and planning.  Definitely worthy to be owned as it is a real achievement in thematic game design.

After two games, and several solo games, I'm beginning to think HF is not to me. On one hand, I praise it for its smarts, its science, its simulation, its unforgivingess - overall a brilliant game. On the other hand, it is a game that requires absolute efficiency. I'm assuming that once all players have adopted the specifics of how to stay efficient, the basic game becomes stolid - if only because the game is now decided by what cards come up and the luck of a d6 at crucial times. I can imagine that the advanced game takes care of some of the efficiency syndrome, adding enough breadth (instead of just depth) to the game to balance it out. That being said, I do believe HF is a game that doesn't get played correctly unless played often, and I've rarely been one for a game that rewards only those who are most familiar with it. Like chess, I love it for its brilliance but absolutely cringe when I start to lose. There are many games where even the loser can enjoy themselves - whether because there are catch-up mechanics or because the game is just "fun". HF has neither. That's okay: it shouldn't. It is a head-trip and one that I have great respect for, but one I can't imagine I would want to go through regularly.

There are some elements about this game that are compelling but the frustration factor remains high. The facts are, for our group at least, it takes an hour worth of gameplay to get your first rocket off the ground at which time you may or may not get blown out of the sky by a hazard and once you make it to your destination you may or may not successfully scan it. Any failure along that path and you're pretty much back to square one. Even if you succeed, you now need to repeat the same journey and bring a refinery with you. All of that, just to get your first Factory going. By the way, you need like 6 factories to win the game... The game takes too long and the setbacks are very discouraging and yet I find myself strangely intrigued. These are the games I hate the most. Deep enough to catch my attention, broken enough to crush my hopes when I play it. :P

It's AP heaven! Rating based on two plays and I will revise it as I go along.

I'll be house-ruling that we use the quick start options in every game otherwise there seem to be too many "by-rote" turns in the early game as all players try to build up their finances.

RATING: 8
The rules are pretty impenetrable, and make the game seem a lot harder than it really is.  Not that it's easy--mission planning is difficult, and when a mission goes badly you can end up back at square one.  Or possibly worse than square one.

If I had a nickel for every time one of us uttered something to the effect of "oh crap, I can't land here," I'd be a rich man.

This one is all about the theme; if space travel holds no appeal for you, forget about it.  As a physics guy, this game appeals to me a lot.

There can be a certain amount of tedium involved, as you twiddle your thumbs for N turns while collecting enough income to launch another mission. This isn't as bad with experienced players who can make quick decisions.

The topic is right up my alley, I got the poster map expansion for this game and the map is awesome!  I love trying to reach the outer reaches of the solar system and this game lets me!  The first time I reached Pluto and Back was just awesome.  The game works well multiplayer me thinks.  But as a solitaire, it still needs some work.  

The solitaire rules build in to the rules are okay, but there isn't much incentive to really explore the distant reaches.  

There are unofficial solitaire rules that still needs SERIOUS tweaking.  They are promising though.  The other players are abstracted which works okay, but the odds of them doing things is dependent on how many WT you have in stock... and that is rather easily manipulated and makes for a gamey game.  (I am talking about the unofficial rules here)

I have tried to play this solo by playing several players, wasn't great fun, because you lose much of the RACE aspect to the game.

My best bet for the best solitaire game is probably to make some up!

Fantastic game on the subject.  Mechanics are surprisingly simple, but the rule make them seem complex.  The rules are densely written, with critical features buried within.

Once you parse through them they are very cohesive and logical.  The living rules are critical to aid in learning.

Start up is a bit tedious, with lots of bids and counters, till players collect enough to start the space part of the game.  Expect up to 10+ rounds of card fiddling.  Fortunately it's a fast process, and over with in about 15 minutes.  Then the interesting space race begins.

The game really shines here, the map is fantastic and very playable.  Filled with lots of easy to read data.  The player cards look busy, and complex, but are quite functional and easy to use once you understand them.

Play is fast, player turns take 1 minute or less, but can stall out, if a player needs to make calculations, while other players are on the move.  I found you can skip them and come around, and allow them a double move most of the time, if they need time to figure out counts.  

Games will take a while as there are few actions per turn, so 2 to 2 1/2 hours a game.

Defiantly no euro style catch up mechanics, bad planning and/or bad luck can ruin your game.  But you get the sense of risk involved in space.

I have only played basic, and found it complex enough.  More plays I might try the advanced game.  Don't let the rules spook you it's really not that hard!

This game is unlike any other game experience I've had to date. It is not a game you play to win as much as you play for the experience. A highly enjoyable and thematicallly rich gameplay experience. Certainly not for all gamers, but I think my rating will continue to go up with more plays. I really like the very tight nature of space exploration, the scientific detail and time spent creating this game. With more plays, I think the potential for interesting negotiation will increase. Adding the expansion will also no doubt expand the gameplay and open up new options. 

Completed my second play. Got the basics down. I really want to add the expansion now, there is a lot things that I think will increase the replayability and interaction between players.

Expansion added in third play. It really completes the game and I highly enjoyed the added options. They provide a bit more flexibility. I really enjoy this game, but I wouldn't recommend it to most gamers. It is hard to find people willing to stick it out beyond their first learning game.

This is a truly great game; quality components and oozing with theme. It's nowhere near as complicated or difficult to grasp as some of the comments would seem to indicate. I'd say the expansion is a 'must have' as it adds so much to the base game and IMHO makes it easier to start off as well (either that or I'm just getting better with practise).

The only downside is that the experience feels incomplete. There's barely enough time to start to develop more advanced technologies and establish a foothold in the solar system before the game ends, and it feels like you only get to scratch the surface which is a terrible shame as I get the feeling there's still a lot more worth exploring.

There are rare games that perfectly integrate setting and gameplay; these are my favorite. Then there are games which tack a setting over a set of elegant mechanisms, which I can tolerate as log as the mechanisms aren't just "be efficient." Finally, there are games which tack a a lot of mechanisms onto a setting. While sometimes fun, these can often evoke a sort of wish-fulfilling hedonistic childishness, the end result of which leads to things like "adult collectible action figures" and libertarianism. This game is one of those.

I will play nearly any game (over 95%) at least twice. I will even "force" myself to replay games I did not like on the first outing to make sure that I didn't have a fluke experience in some way.

That being said, I will NEVER play this game a second time.

I have lots of respect for the efforts that were obviously poured into the design. Too bad a technical writer was outside the budget.

Outstanding.  

The thought that went into this game to make it realistic and playable is simply amazing.  The rules are not complex, but the strategy is massively deep.  The challenge is not figuring out how to play, it is figuring out how to play well.

The mission planning required to be succesful will certainly make this a game that isn't for everyone, and really not even for the majority of people.  You can not just build a rocket and start moving around without a plan - this will lead to nothing but frustration.

If real space exploration interests you, and you grew up interested in what NASA was up to, this game is the one you have been waiting for.

When learning this game, I would recommend at least 2 plays with the basic rules and the quick start.  When you are learning, you won't understand the benefit of one patent versus another, so you might as well start with some random ones and experiment.

My house rule (advanced game):  players start with 6WT, high roller picks a faction and starts a bid.  winner of the bid gets the faction (money to bank).  If the player that chose the faction didn't win the bid, they pick another and so on until everyone has a faction.  Once you have a faction, you can no longer bid.

includes expansion and poster map

Note:  These comments only cover the Legacy (non-Colonization) game.  Legacy, for me, froze on April 11, 2013.  The real shame about HF is the designer didn't stop meddling with it - now I highly suspect that no two groups play with the same set of rules (or interpretation of the rules).  IMHO, while some interesting things got added past my freeze date, many of these things are not balanced, add a lot of time to the game, and have a number of hazy points about how they work.

Més que un joc, és una simulació de com seria l'exploració, colonització i industrialització espacial. Tots els detalls estan molt ben cuidats, i realment vius el que estas fent.

First attempt at playing, I experienced an unnecessarily complicated game mostly consumed with mathematical planning and a poor fun to work radio.  A lot of very good ideas in the game but the bloated prototype was never developed, and went into print "as is."  Yikes.  I would like to play again, but I don't have high hopes.  The game needs a glossary and a decent player aid.  I actually think if you did all that, plus started the game with more resources (so the tedious, repetitious build up didn't take so long) the game would be a lot better. 

I also would not play again with 5.

Possibly more simulation than game, but I've had fun with it so far. Does a very good job of creating the required atmosphere; one of the best games in this regard. You really do feel like you're planning and competing against other organizations for profit in the arena of the solar system. There is a fair amount of randomness, but that helps lend a certain charm, as the game would be just stats calculation without. Need to pull it out again soon.

Feelings about this keep fluctuating. It's a very interesting game for sure, but I'm undecided on how good I truly think it is.

Can be really entertaining if you play with 3, you don't have China present, and nobody gets a crazy roll early game on an asteroid. The problem with China here is they make everything take forever at first as people want to guard against being claim-jumped (and justifiably so), and a single amazingly lucky roll early game can be essentially unbeatable.

But those things aside, nothing else plays like it, and it really is interesting.

[center][size=6][COLOR=#878787]LIFETIME GAME [microbadge=28495]:star:[microbadge=28496] "PLAY FOREVER"[/COLOR][/size][/center]

[b]tl;dr[/b] — [b]After 30 plays:[/b]  This has become my most favorite game ever.  It is a Masterpiece, a Magnum Opus and there is nothing quite like it.  If you are even remotely into space science/exploration then this was built for you.  Just take your time, ease into it and don't be in a hurry to swallow the whole shebang in one go.

[q=After 40 plays][b]This is the best version of the game.[/b]  "Legacy" [i]High Frontier[/i]—the base game with the [thing=68305]Expansion[/thing], and the published rules and maps as they stood in October of 2011—is a perfectly tight 5p/two-hour experience that gets exponentially better the more you play.

[i]Colonization[/i] complicated it out the yinyang and bloated it into a game that no longer fits inside most heads or a single evening.  And I'm still not sure what 3rd Edition is doing—from here it looks like minor tweaks for tweaking's sake, making it unlikely I'll go that route as (1) I have all the previous versions, including multiple poster maps, (2) members of my group who [i]never[/i] buy games bought all the previous versions, and (3) they all play perfectly fine as is.[/q]
[microbadge=21441]

Right now... just seriously geeking out on the science.  Shot a rover at Mars and managed to get it there, survived the aerobraking maneuver only to lose it in a sandstorm.

Intrigued and really looking forward to a proper play.

UPDATE:  First play.  [i]Mind blown.[/i]

UP-UPDATE:  Rockets to a solid 9 after two more back-to-back plays, one of which saw the Japanese lose salarynauts over Venus, the ESA looping the screams of their brave [i]aströnautes[/i] (breaking up on final approach to Comet Encke) in swanky discotheques, and the UN burning in [i]three full crews[/i] over Mars, one after the other, grinding the same doomed mission over and over again.  Twenty-four cosmonauts later, Mars was his.

Some thoughts:

[b]It's not nearly as complicated or difficult as the rules would have you believe.[/b]
This is the game that dares you to figure out how to play.  While the living rules and other attempts at simplified rules, summaries, walk-throughs & etc. all help a great deal, none of them are as clear or straightforward as they could or should be.  Once you [i]do[/i] figure out how to play, the game's a lot simpler than it appears.  That's not to say it's not complex, but the complexity arises from the potential bushiness of the decision tree growing in the sandbox.

The obtuse rule book and the effort required to sift through the spray of Internet resources to figure out just how to play the damn thing keep it from a truly-deserved 10.

[b]The base game is more than enough for a good while.[/b]
It's a pretty enormous sandbox—you've got the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars (Phobos & Deimos), and a spray of asteroids & comets, with a deep selection of tech to get you Out There... aaand no real direction.*  It's simultaneously terrifying and liberating.  You can run any mission you can imagine, any way you can finagle it.  While it's daunting trying to figure out just what to do, it's exhilarating when a really complicated orbital ballet comes together—solar sail a crew module out from Earth to rendezvous with a freighter carrying a high-tech thruster built by robots at your factory on a distant rock, ditch the sail and burn for the outpost where you stashed some prospecting robonauts, pick them up, refuel on an icy asteroid and wing to the outer edges of the solar system.

[size=7]*The pre-fab "signpost" missions are a good start, but some favor different tech over others which puts you in the Catch-22 position of not knowing good from bad without several plays.  Being a sandbox experience, failure is half the fun, right?[/size]

Ultimately, the unfortunate effort required to figure it all out is more than worth it.  There's no board game experience quite like it and I find myself daydreaming of the most harebrained and unlikely missions...

Can't wait to play more!

UP-UP-UPDATE:  More sandbox sim than game.  There is no "rubber-banding" mechanism to help those who fall behind, and whiffing on a single risky maneuver (aerobraking or hazard) can cost you the win.**  This isn't a knock against the game at all—it's a simulation with a lesson to teach, and it teaches it well:  space exploration & exploitation is expensive, difficult and dangerous.  It's only for those with resolve and daring.  A frontier indeed.  When sitting down to roll through this it's best to adjust the mindset appropriately—it's an experience, a sim, a place to experiment and fail.  Attempting to game it or play it in a "gamey" fashion will result in a crippled, unsatisfying half-experience.

[size=7]**You can avoid taking those risks by not going there or invoking the FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION RULE (spending 4 WT to skip the die roll)... but then your game will develop more slowly than those who accept the risk and dive in head-first.[/size]

Surprisingly, playtime has hovered around two hours, even for our five-player games!

UP-UP-UP-UPDATE:  It's really, really hard to watch Taikonauts loot your billion-dollar landing site—using your flag to erase your footprints and your commemorative plaque as a hammer.  It's the kind of vandalism that hardens hearts and launches nukes...

I think this just might be my favorite game.

RATING: 9.5
Note: my comments apply to the "expanded game".  The game types should arguably be called "starter" and "full" rather than "basic" and "expanded".  The basic game is a great way to begin, but it is really just intended as a tutorial.

I bought this game because apparently it has been a 30 year labour of love and a serious attempt to simulate the industrialisation of our solar system.  As a "hard" sci-fi fan, this had me champing at the bit.  To be honest, I cannot offer any immediate comment on the authenticity of his model, but the amount of time and passion which has gone into this game is obvious.  The geek level is way off the charts, and the group I play with (who share similar tastes to me) react with alternate "ah, that is sooo cool" exclamations and riotous laughter at what Phil has managed to achieve.

The learning curve is steep!  However, it is one of the most fun games to learn.  If you love hard sci-fi, if you love simulations and if you love games then you will love this.  You know who you are.

After several games, I now feel that I will probably settle on a 9 rating rather than bump it up to 10.  It is just too inaccessible to enjoy in the same way that I enjoy other games.  Also, it plays so differently to any other game - it is like solving some crazy mathematical puzzle.  It feels like you are playing the board and the cards more than your opponents - which is also part of the appeal.  You feel like you are trying to plan a tough mission into space!  Another issue is downtime.  At any point in the game each player's turn might take 10 seconds or 10 minutes.  This can make it very frustrating during multi-player games - you can end up acting for just a few seconds every 20 minutes.  As such, my favourite way to play this game (at the moment) is two-player.

Several more two-player games later, mostly courtesy of Vassal, and this is going up to a 9.5.  It really is one of my favourite games of all time despite its inaccessibility.  The experience is unique and it is always a talking point, so I often find myself sticking it in my bag even when the chance of playing it is low.

This is a strange game mostly because it's a simulation before it's a game.  It took me a few plays to figure out how I felt about this one.

The complexity comes from the rules trying to quite accurately model space flight & rocket construction.  It doesn't help that the rulebook seems to get updated every few months but once I figured the rules out & freed my brain to focus on the 'game' I felt that there weren't too many important decisions to make.

There isn't much complex interaction between players (apart from open deal making) or even between the game's subsystems (unlike some of the heavier Euros, say) & too much of the tension comes down to the result of a D6.  Without that D6, all your missions would succeed (presuming you can count fuel correctly, which isn't too hard) & so after that it's mostly just a race, with the winner typically determined by a lucky start (in terms of setup) or buying the right stuff at auction.

The expanded game adds a lot more die rolls (typically checking if your stuff is destroyed each turn or not) & a bunch of other things that, for me, don't really change the fundamentals in an interesting way.  Race for sites, get lucky, make deals if you want or care.

The game would be much more interesting for me if players could have multiple rockets but the amount of bookkeeping required for a single rocket makes this unfeasible.

As it stands the game play is just too simple for my liking & nearly all the replayability comes from the die rolls to determine whether your ship is destroyed & whether you find anything at a site.

Despite its shortfalls as a game I actually don't mind a casual play every now & then, mostly to see how my luck plays out.

Update: With the latest rules changes, map changes & everything else still up in the air I'm not going to pour any more money into this or play it again.  I'll be avoiding Phil's "games" in future.

Holy space bucks. This game. I had it on the trade list, because I didn't think I was ever going to make it through the rulebook and get it to the table. I though about putting it up in an auction or math trade now that it is worth some cash.

So so so glad I didn't. I just played at a local game day, and my mind has officially been blown. I think I am going to dream of water tanks and thrusters tonight.

Sounds VERY cool except:

Luck - Hopefully houserules can make it managable....

AP - Calculation crazy, could be bad for me

Also these comments from John which I've seen elsewhere concern me too:

[i]If I'm going to plan, plot, project, ponder, recalculate, and envision, it needs to amount to something. For whatever reason, High Frontier is one of those games that ends just as it gets going. Do I want it to be longer than the current playtime of four hours? No. Do I want a meaningful payoff? Yes. That's really the dilemma holding High Frontier back in my initial impression.[/i]

--------

Well I watched most of a gameplay video and it looks like a game I would love to play once but probably not own. Its mostly a sim for sure and not so much of a game at all (other than trying to best your opponents) which is fine and a nice change from the usual. I think as a sim it might rate an 8 for me, but as a game its more like a 5, this equates to a 6.5 for me since I would be playing it for both reasons.

I see where many people's frustration is coming from, I know its realistic and all but do you really want to subject yourself to it in something you are supposed to be doing for fun? Guess it depends right, and let's not forget, when/if things DO work out, that has to be one very satisfying and gratifying experience. I still do have some interest in owning it since it plays solo and is such a unique and fascinating topic and also provides a very rich experience

Very fun game. Definitely requires a lot of planning and thought. No feeling like thinking you're going to be the first person to land on the moon, only to discover that you miscalculated your fuel by 1 and you have to turn around. Basic game only, so far. Will try the advanced soon though as the group is looking forward to it.

I want to give this game two ratings

7 as a set of game mechanics
10 as a game-based experience
The average of which is 8.5  

After a few plays of the basic game, I have graduated to Colonization, albeit without any of the additional modules yet.

The level of background detail and the enthusiam for space travel of the rulebook are to be admired.

We've had our first try with support cards and radiation belt rules, and OMG! The "my head is exploding!" feeling was back: It was like playing the game for the first time again. Awesome.
------
Presently, we use a hybrid rules variant, where we play mostly basic rules, but use the big map and a few of the advanced rules (regolith refuellers, jettisoning stuff, slingshots). This works well with beginners, although we advice them to concentrate on the basic game board (for their own sake). ;-)

A couple of (basic) games later: It's just brilliant!

My first game (3p, basic rules) came off to a slow start, with players spending the first hour or so buying and selling patents and accumulating WTs. Eventually we set out for the stars, and what fun it was! I can't wait to play again.

A thoroughly immersive game of industrialization in the nearer reaches of the solar system.

Pros:  Extremely true to theme.  Game board presents a fair amount of interesting decisions once one cuts through the visual clutter.  Rules are straightforward once explained.  There appear to be multiple valid paths to victory - Mars glory/factory rush and fast moon base freight both seem like they could work though the Mars rush is vulnerable to carboniferous devaluation.  I'm sure there are more valid strategies than we revealed on our first play.

Cons:  Some cards (like the 15*1/2 thruster) are unbalanced beyond any ability for an early-game auction to regulate them effectively.  This isn't really a problem with more experience, as the players who don't win that card just have to make sure the winner doesn't get to build a moon base, possibly with some explicit collusion.  But it can seriously warp an early play.  Fuel calculations are necessarily AP-inducing.  The early-game research turns can get ponderous.

I think High Frontier will sustain 5-7 plays easily, and it will have been worth the money and effort if it does.

I can't recommend this game enough for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of arithmetic, is willing to play a 3-hour game, and wants a deeply thematic experience.

Without a doubt the steepest learning curve I have ever attempted. It is hard to see what you're trying to accomplish without playing it. The thickness of the science terminology, constant route planning, and calculations makes for an incredibly dense and (initially) intimidating experience. While I certainly appreciate Mr. Eklund's commitment to topic authenticity, this one has been a bear for me. 

In the end I wasn't able to rope more than one other person into playing. Even then, it feels like we are spending way too much time in the rule book.

It's like aquiring a taste for fine wine, it's not for everyone, but I tend to like it quite a bit!  It is a thinker and you have to plan ahead!  Things can change drastically in a turn and a planet you have intended to visit and set up shop may be taken right under your nose facing you with the problem of flying somewhere else...if you can!

RATING: 7
High Frontier draws on over two decades of the designer's experience in the field of space exploration technology, and it shows. Progress is incredibly difficult; in fact, the gameplay here is more about "hopes and dreams" than it is about zooming around the galaxy and leveraging powerful new technology. Expect at least an hour of playtime dedicated to the acquisition of future-tech patents and the slow buildup of fuel for a maiden voyage, and expect that maiden voyage to be merely the first, painstaking step toward actually planting a claim somewhere in deep space. Imagine securing a patent in the first two minutes of the game (via auction). In all likelyhood, it will take two hours for you to realize the potential of that one card. "Exoglobalization" is a commitment.

And that's not to say that this is a bad game, but be warned. If I had to guess, I'd say Eklund set out to deliver a cold dose of reality in which players struggle against merciless logistics, not a game in which players make productive and extensive use of cool, flashy technology. I respect that. Indeed I'd go so far as to say I'm awed by it. This is one of the more interesting boardgaming experiences I've had this year. But it's also one that, after two plays, is testing my patience. If I'm going to plan, plot, project, ponder, recalculate, and envision, it needs to amount to something. For whatever reason, High Frontier is one of those games that ends just as it gets going. Do I want it to be longer than the current playtime of four hours? No. Do I want a meaningful payoff? Yes. That's really the dilemma holding High Frontier back in my initial impression.

High Frontier deserves to be played. It also demands to that players work at realizing its potential, and many, many gamers will credit it with authenticity and charm but shelve it for good after one play. I'm going to keep working at it, but honestly I wouldn't blame them.

This is so realistic, but the rules are surprisingly straight. You have a hard time to read this rulebook, ok, but when you understood the rules, they are pretty logical. One of those games that are so deep in the theme that each session is a fantastic journey. Brilliant. 

Only thing that made me rate it "8" instead of "9" or "10": If your first mission is a failure, you are almost out of the game because it takes soooo long to store enough water tanks / money to start another mission - while other players with more luck start to ship ET products to earth and generate a big amount of cash.

If you don't mind this realistic outworking to the theme, get this game!

Despite the initial learning curve, this is a surprisingly easy game to play once you get the hang of it - only the strategy is complex.

Playtested this july 2009.
I was very impressed by the explanation of all the technolgies you could discover in the game. For people interested in that consider buying it for that alone.
Fantastic job.
Besides the discovery explantions and what they would do there is also a game in there.

the game moves fast. no real downtime in turns and a great player aid included. No work for Universal Head here to be found.
Also the sequence of actions feels right.

Rating is for the playtest copy. I can only see it improve after the rules are final.

I think it needs a little bit more balancing in the scoring as some organisations  actions are a little bit better than others and it is hard to catch up.
Then again in real life it is hard to find companies, countries of equal strength. His game designs are a lot about e having a good time and enjoying the experience. We all had that.

I feel that I have to say something about movement as well.
I haven't played a game in which movement was treated as it is in this game. And it really made sense. Infact so much sense that somewhere someone else should have thought about it too. (I'm not implying here that he stole someone elses idea; but just because it fellt so right and logical I can hardly believe noone has done this before.) 

 Phil made a decision to simplify things. The planets keep the same distance from each other during the entire game. Well I don't know Phil personally but I think he did it because of the gameplay (downtime) since changing distances could take very long and even if you were able to work it in a map it could become very confusing.

Note: the game looked ready for a Essen 2009 release but it looks like we have to wait an extra year.

Based on two plays - one 2-player, one solo (Hermes Fall scenario): a deep game, that keeps you coming back and thinking how you could have done things differently.
 
I've tried the expanded game from start, got some rules wrong, but hell - it was fun! I imagine that the basic game would be too light for my taste, much of the fun is from struggling to build a workable rocket design - I believe a puzzle of 6 pieces (using the expansion) is much more satisfying than the 3 piece basic game. :)

Be warned, this is not a game for everyone. Although the designer went a long way to hide the actual science behind the scene you still have to do some basic maths and basic physics knowledge helps understand why thing are the way they are. Also, the "space road-map" is so complicated that you can spend quite a lot of time trying to find an optimal route between two spaces.
Definitely not for AP susceptible people.

Got this game in trade from Sagrilarus because of HiveGod's blog post [blogpost=2063]here[/blogpost].  I thought you guys said this game was [i]hard;[/i] the basic game has like 7 pages of rules!  And I've already learned tons of stuff just by having the rulebook sitting near me!  (I can't wait to play this.)

I will probably use cfarrell's suggestions [thread=641042]here[/thread].  See also his [thread=641076]hints for new players[/thread].

Update: After the first game with the burrito boy (age 11), he wanted to leave the game set up so that we could keep playing.  Although the complexity of the basic game is comparable to many Euros, you will probably not be happy if you're coming at this with a Euro "we'll open the box, read the rules aloud to everyone, and start playing" approach instead of a wargaming "I'll study the rules and run through a test game before showing this to my friends" approach.  I [b]strongly recommend[/b] cfarrell's "hints for new players" thread above.

[b]After 3 plays[/b] (2-player, basic game): I'm really liking this, & will probably try to unleash this on my regular group next time there's a chance.  Although the turns are super-simple, the openness of the "here's what gives you points; now go do anything you want in the solar system to get them" decision tree may be crippling.  I expect to quote Chapel:

[q="MWChapel"]I had to yell at a gamer once and said "Look, stop trying to process the whole damn map. Stop trying to plan 10 different things to do in your head. Pick a location, and work to go to that location. Period" The rules about auctions, building, and launching the rocket? Basic stuff.

Make a goal. "I'm going to Saturn". Great, lets see what I need to get there. See, that wasn't so hard.[/q]
Also, in the first few plays, we may have some "let's all stop and think for five minutes" breaks.

Update: the boy prefers the Basic Game, and I haven't had much luck in getting anyone around here to play this, but I'm calling it [i]at least[/i] an 8, maybe a 10, because I do really have a lot of fun getting stomped by Ben & Dana once a year (or twice, if I'm lucky).

El fallo que tiene es que cuando tienes un accidente con tu cohete, el sistema para volver a construir uno es tedioso y lento, mientras el resto de los jugadores sigue explorando el espacio. Pero qué bien está artículado alrededor del tema.

LIKES:

* One has to plan well ahead in order to make everything come together correctly.  Failure to do so will lead to massive problems and failures.  This is not a forgiving game.
* I really like the game board - it is quite unique.
* Movement is really interesting - and can be quite mathy/brain burning to figure out.  The whole weight vs range/fuel capacity can be extremely annoying as well in the calculation.  I probably tried to do too much in one mission.

DISLIKES:

* Maybe if I knew what to do better, I could see a faster start out of the gate, but I just feel this game drags out of the gate.  It can end very quickly, however!
* After one play, I still don't know if I have any idea how to play better.  That is usually a LIKE for me, but I feel as brain dazed and confused now as I did at the start of the game.

I've always been curious about this but it seemed intimidating to learn. Turns out it's actually quite manageable and, dare I say it, fun. There are some odd, Eklundian elements to the game (like, if you need a radiator, you can't just get a radiator, you have to wait for a different item that also gets you a radiator) but for the most part things make sense and run fairly clearly. 

It's also crazy hazardous, as space travel should be. After building my Venus Penetrator 3000 rocket it got destroyed in the Venusian atmosphere because I rolled a 1. A lot of gamers would not tolerate such a thing. (The follow-up Venus Penetrator 3000X successfully landed humans on Venus and returned them home safely.) Later, a solar flare knocked out my rocket, along with another player's. 

It's long, and can be frustrating, but it really gives you a sense of accomplishment when you finally do achieve something. It's fun too!

Very fond of this game. It has some weird rules and a rulebook to make you cry but once you get pass that plays very well. My wife hates the comparison but for me its Arkham Horror in space, by that I mean the game tells a story and you play your part. It's got a great puzzle element to designing your craft as well. On the other hand as far as I'm concerned you need the base game and expansion otherwise it feels like half a game.

[Update] Game has really grown on me, there is always something to do and explore. This one is a keeper.

The geekiest game in my collection (and that includes Birds of Prey and Harpoon4) A game on orbital mechanics and space exploration technology, what's not to like about that?

This game talks to corners of my geek than no other game has, so far. High Frontier can get *really* competitive, and winning *is* nice, but the sense of accomplishment when you pull of the mission you had planned is very rewarding in its own right.

The Zubrini-Saltwater thruster can be very unbalancing, but it *is* a lot of fun to zip from LEO to mercury in one go with a complete factory and back in 4 years, including tanking - There are a lot of tweaks that can offset this, though - such as not allowing factories on the moon, or upping its cooling requirement.

There are a couple of things I miss, such as controling more than one rocket (could be done), and some kind of system  for technology transfer.

The market and auctioning system leaves me a bit wanting, but zipping around the solar system is way more fun than it sounds like.

My mental image of the game is very 2001-esque, with cool, but relatively primitive craft decending silently out of the black sky, to touch down on some small dirty snowball, while the rings of saturn takes up more than a third of the sky

I have played the base game.  This is massively complex in terms of accessibility from the rulebook, but overall once you are aware of the rules, it is not so bad.  The base game is very much a simulation, and you have to realize that you are going to win often due to luck.  You can mitigate this somewhat but if you get a claim with the letter that works for you, often you are doing pretty well.  Players that don't get complimentary claims will lose.  

If you really like space exploration and are interested in colonizing planets this is an interesting game.  If you don't like simulations with a healthy dose of luck, stay away

This is a complex title with a lot of parts that have to work just right together for your efforts to be successful. The dice are there to make sure this doesn't happen all the time.

This can be an interesting event style game. Making a fine rocket will get you a long ways but anything can happen out there. Be prepared to get stuck for a while sometimes.

[i]High Frontier[/i] is a problem solving delight (or horror) depending on your disposition. You end up with thrusters that are good to get to one planet or asteroid but not another, but robonauts more suited for somewhere completely different. And neither share the same generators. So do you ditch the thruster or the robonaut and hopefully find something else that works? Or do you try and find a different planet/asteroid that the combo would work and carry two different generators adding to the mass of your ship? It's enough to make you want to get fried in the Earth's radiation belt.  Unfortunately, while I find it a delight, my friends and wife do not.

This is a game that I would have liked to have been taught to me instead of reading the AWFUL rules...they are REALLY bad.  There are too many examples of games that are deeper and more complex than HF that have great rule books that teach you how to play.  Instead of the appendix of the patent cards, I'd have rather had a bunch of walk-throughs, esp for the basic game.

That said, I think there is a great game here.

The theme and ideas are a 10. This is a fascinating topic, and distilled in a novel and elegant fashion. Playable in reasonable time, with a wealth of strategies and equally suitable for pretyt much any number of players. Fantastic.

The execution... well... the rules are terrible. frankly,after I played the game for the first time, I rated it a 5, but I was really being charitable.  The experience was painful; a 3 would have been more appropriate, but as the months went by all the background detail clamoured to me again and I went at it again eventually.  Why are major rules sections (operations and moves) included in reverse order of play?  Why is the example basic game, which is probably the most important thing for getting into the game, hidden between the expansion scenarios and the example expansion game?  I only found it by chance once I started looking at the expansion rules. Bizarre.

I have now played it again, ftf.  We worked our way through the rules. It dragged a bit, mostly due to a number of rules questions that in the end, we all settled. Should move faster in the next game.  My opinion of the game (not the rules) has much improved and I look forward to trying the advanced rules and the expansion.

I'll always be interested in a space themed game. This is because I am not a scientist, just someone who loves stories set in space. This game is science -- deep science, which requires a lot of math. It's not a database, but the rules were like taking a science course that I didn't have the prerequisites for. I really wanted to love this game, but I'm the one who is deficient, not the game.

This game is not for everyone. It is going to feel frustrating, overwhelming and difficult. But the game is highly successful at creating a highly immersive, thematic and very intriguing game. 
Space exploration is indeed a dificult endeavor and the game captures that. Space exploration also encompases some very difficult dicesions that span political, bearucratic and technical balance, which is exactly what you do in this game; balance some big decisions with what technology you have, where to go, how you're going to get there, facing the adversity of your competing space agencies and the massive risks of traveling in space. 
The rulebook feels horribly laid out and difficult to navigate, but it is indeed pretty concise and well thought out. Give it a chance and it will serve you well. After a few games, there isn't anything I haven't been able to resolve from within the book.

After playing this game, I literally look at the night sky differently... the moon and mars and venus look downright close.  Scary close.  It's quite disconcerting actually.

This game looks so amazing!  Any rulebook with proper journal citations has to be appreciated!

That said, its taking me a while to figure out the rules.  I wish there was a good basic game solo scenario so that I could teach myself the rules before I go a 'splain'n.  Also, I really wish there was a good co-op scenario so that two players could learn together - perhaps something like the Hermes scenario where you have to each make a separate landing (maybe even a simultaneous landing) by a certain turn number on specific locations.

After one game I am loving this game.  My one caveat is that you really need to find people that are excited to learn this game and are willing to read the rulebook before the first game.  You really need to grok the whole game to be able to put together a strategy; otherwise, the game will be a lot of, "so what do I do now?"

A space race designed by a real life rocket scientist in which you race to build a rocket in low earth orbit and then fly out to nearby asteroids to mine them for rare elements so you can build tech in low or zero gee you wouldn't be able to manufacture on Earth.

Played one 4-player basic game and one 2-player expansion game. I think the single base game map is too small for 4. I played horribly in the 4-player game and pretty good in teh 2-player expansion game ... mostly because of the lack of experience but a little because there is only so much good shit to go around ... then you're left with a 4 efficiency thruster while two others have a 1 and another has a sail.

Fun game ... probably great but just really good right now. I prefer the expansion game and pieces to the basic.

Playtester.  This is a smooth game filled with science I didn't know.  Really like the movement mechanisms.  Tough to know where to go, but I guess space is like that. It will kick you in the teeth as you realize how you cannot add to twelve, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  The box is sturdy, the board looks fantastic, and more science facts than you can shake a quark at.  Great stuff mad even better with expansion.

I'll update my rating after another play.  First impression is that I'm very impressed with the overall science of the design.  The map, the physics and the technologies are all ambitiously realistic.  However, the play of the game, once you take out the strange auction/money system, although intriguing feels more like simulation than a game.  You really need to plan ahead to get anywhere and then hope your calculations were correct because the penalty of having your ship blow-up can set you back many turns.  On the other hand, a safe landing having avoided radiation, meteors, etc. can be extremely gratifying.

Very cool game, especially if you're a bit geeky about space exploration.

This game is frankly loopy, and all the better for it. Probably the most complex non war game I have encountered, even the basic game has several pages of rules. The basics fit together quite nicely, leaving the meat of the challenge in figuring out just how you're going to get your space faring expedition under-way. A fascinating effort, and certainly if I am going to be playing a game for a few hours and it's not going to be a war game, then this is the kind of thing I'd be happy to get stuck into.

Lots of flavor. I want to like the science games produced by Sierra Madre. I think that there is  good game somewhere in this title, but it's hidden by poorly written rules, uninteresting mechanics, and not enough payoff for what is invested in the game (especially time). 

In this game, the fuel consumption rules still throw me for a loop. I just don't get how you move any sort of ship with some of of those white card thrusters--especially when you have to load up on radiators, generators, and reactors.

RATING: 9.7
A game which got tabled once in 10/2014, with Justin. The theme is still gripping to me, over 3 years later, because it is a fairly scientifically-accurate simulator for how space travel might happen, in just a few decades. Worrying about Lagrange points (where the gravity between bodies cancels out) and whether or not your fuel/currency water is going to run out before you reach your destination... the game is a gripping way of considering that question always on my heart - given how quickly we're wrecking this one habitable planet, just how poorly is it going to go, when we are forced to try and colonize elsewhere?

HIGHLY recommend, along with a lot of uninterrupted time.

Oh my... This is a simulation and not a game and the rules are indecipherable, at least unless you are well versed in the topic. Although there is a good resource linked here that helps a lot.

---------------------

6: Rating is tentative after first play. Rules are incredibly arcane and obtuse, and even with a walkthrough, we still felt lost and frustrated. I feel like I have a good command of the science behind the game (I almost even majored in Astronomy) and so I would agree it does do a good job capturing the thematic science-related reasons behind elements of the game design. However, that doesn't make the experience necessarily any more playable. Hopefully this one will improve after future plays.

========================

8: Ratings revised to an 8 after second play with expansion. Something about how it all works finally clicked and I really enjoyed myself. It turns out, the game is really not all that complex once you figure out how it all fits together, and the strategies are not that deep, but the risk factor for successful endeavors is incredibly high - I almost feel like I am playing the game system more than the other players here, since the margin of success in the early game is so low that there is sometimes literally a nailbiting finish toward the end. Can't wait to play it again.

=============================

9: Another ratings bump to 9. Each game of this gets better and better. In my most recent game, I got unlucky and had my rockets burn up in the Martian atmosphere TWICE, and I still had a blast playing. Cannot wait to get it to the table again.

=============================

9.9: Ratings bump to 9.9 after my ninth play. This is, without a doubt, one of the most intense thematic narrative experiences ever, and at the same time, now that I understand the rules, know the cards inside and out, and have found some of the hidden map shortcuts and secret tricks, it's also one of the most competitive board games I own. With players who know the game well, every turn matters, every action counts, and the game escalates to a crescendo in the final round. I always suggest, I always want to play, and I can't see that changing in the foreseeable future. Like my other all-time favorite game (Diplomacy) the real tragedy of it is, it's not a game for casual gamers or stupid people, which means the pool of people I will get to play it with is very tiny. Still, it is an absolute glory of a game.

----------

A final note: with the Colonization expansion, and the right people at the table, there is no other game I'd rather play.

Tedious, slow paced and brain burning, but I love it for the awesome theme.  It's just dripping with realistic or at least plausible sounding sci-tech from the near future.  It feels like you are really working at NASA.  I do think there is a slight issue with random events that you just can't plan for or mitigate, but again this fits with the theme of running a space program, I suppose.  Need to play more to find out for sure, but based on one play seems like something I would like.

Ok, so it's impossible to say anything definitive about this game after only one play, because I understood maybe 40% of what was going on. It seems to be very hard to teach, because basically players should already have some knowledge of the different rocket parts and what do with them etc. to be effective & it is very info heavy. So at least I myself would need hours with the manual and the components before even trying to play it again. Repeated plays probably benefit this game a lot, since the learning curve is very cumulative & there is always new frontiers to reach. I already see the simulator side of it and like it.

The movement is an artform of its own, which I failed to learn during the one game. So I was kind of a freeloader, I mostly just asked what I should do next, since I had NO idea. At all. BUT if I gave it the time and repeated plays, I would probably enjoy it. Will I do that? Probably not, since I do not own the game and would not find any people to play it with. Plus even if I did, it it would probably be more trouble than it is worth.

I'm a big Kerbal Space Program fan and I loved all the complexities of Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri so naturally I was going to like High Frontier. If you like that kind of hard sci-fi High Frontier is a masterpiece. Its rough to get into because the sheer amount of rules are staggering (and if you don't have an idea of what a delta-v is or a hohmann transfer burn then they also might seem arbitrary as hell) and the upcoming expansion Colonization makes it that much rougher. Whats even rougher is convincing other people to play with you (at least consistently). But if you've got a good group or are willing to play quite a bit alone (beware, this game has an auction system which needs experienced players to really reach its full potential) and you enjoyed all the other things above this is a must have.

It is deeply satisfying to construct your factories and meander through space. I do not feel it is as complicated to play as many players make it out to be, especially if you play with only the basic rules for the first few times. 

Still, the learning curve is steep as you figure out which sites are worth the trip and which are not. Which pieces and parts are worth spending for and which are not. How to bid, when to bid, and what to bid. All of this makes for a game that requires multiple plays just to understand, but that is part of the beauty of High Frontier; you explore the game just as you explore space, and the rules mostly blend into the background as you jostle to accomplish what you want. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
High Frontier is an amazing game that many people dislike because of its complexity. Playing this almost feels like you are travelling to outer space for real. The game probably has the most interesting map of all time. Unfortunately there are some balance issues and counter-intuitive rules to prevent this from being a 10/10.

Before the expansion, it took 5 hours just to get money to do anything (every turn was auction then sell, auction then sell over and over); now with colonists and starting cards the money flows more freely but the limit of only 1 rocket really drags the game. I feel like it takes a really poor designer to not realize that something as simple as giving unlimited rockets (or giving starting cards/money before expansions) would help the game so much.

Incredibly realistic pick and deliver game. It really gives you the feeling of managing an spacial agency. Very clever design.

Big learning curve, not only because of the rules, but also because of exploring the many non obvious possibilities the game offers.

The game manual is terribly dense + the game outlook is not inviting. The rules are complex, but not as overtly difficult as the manual suggest.

The first part is a bit boring, until you get things going.

Very long, easily beyond the 3 hours mark if you are not a veteran player. That + theme + outlook + dense manual = only for game or space enthusiasts/geeks.

The second edition includes many changes.

First impression (4 players, not completed): Not sure if I played a game or a simulation of some sorts. As a game with a pace we had ... sloooow ... this isn't worth my time. So much time went into fighting rules (sort of) and so little was done. Maybe if players were more experienced / faster then it would be better experience.

Not a "game" for me (but I knew this before I went into this ... more of a learning experience than real game). With players I play with ... this won't work.

After only getting a few turns into a my first (PBF) game, I have already come to the realisation that this game may well be the very pinnacle of game design coinciding with my tastes. The theme is truly evocative, and the structure is overflowing with innumerable interesting choices from start to finish.

While there certainly is a bit of a learning curve to overcome at the start, I can think of no other game which has rewarded me in similar proportion to the effort I put into learning High Frontier.

RATING: 9
My first game was pure "Huh?", with a lot of "What do I do now?" thrown in for good measure. I got trounced, of course, as experience counts for a lot.

My second game was fun but oh so frustrating as the luck of the dice got me pretty good, I ended up in a pretty wide-ranging discussion with a good friend about how to improve and better balance the game.

My third and fourth games (fourth was the first with advanced game elements, although the third game included the expansion map) were where the game really started to come together and shine. More die rolling actually makes the luck BETTER, as the more you roll the more the rolls start to even out and approach their 'long view' odds. A wider, bigger map with more options makes various victory paths more viable. And the mental puzzle of trying to shoehorn reactors, generators and radiators onto your rocket is decidedly agonizing (you'll learn to loathe that 4 card hand limit!).

There is still a ton of luck in the game, and if you can't handle your carefully-laid plans going horribly awry because you rolled a 1, well, then put the box down slowly and back away. I felt that way at first but am starting to see the charm in the game despite the potential for you to sometimes, well, die. Space exploration is hard. Really hard. You can get killed up there, and when you do just shrug and ready your next crew...

I have played it several times now - with and without the expansion.

I find it a good game overall. It does rely upon you getting a good understanding of the detail in order to be able to evaluate and play out the possible strategies - unlike other games where you can work out a high level plan and fill in the details as you go along when learning.

Will appeal to some and not to others. We have a 50% hit rate in our gaming group - 3 will play it again and 3 will not. If you are looking for a detailled, technically oriented game and have a passion for physics or engineering then this might be the game for you!

RATING: 5
A head-aching affair of shipping stuff into space, prospecting sites, building factories with the stuff you brought - which gives you better stuff to get more VPs faster with future voyages, and so on. Beautifully and painstakingly thematic, but with downsides. Huge downsides. So much so that I can only probably recommend this to wannabe rocket boys who'll get theme thrills. The first is that it seems like forever to get up and going, slowly accumulating the stuff you want to ship out, plus the fuel you need to ship out on. Turn after turn of patient accumulation. At least this gives you time to study the brain-spinning map and determine a best route for your type of engine, and therefore how much fuel you'll need, not only to get there, but how you're going to get back (or how you're going to re-fuel out there in space, or will you just trash the rocket and start again). Mastering the terse rule set is a fullon activity in itself. Working out how the hell you play it well is another mess to conquer. This struggle produces engagement, but the slowness and length reduces the sense of togetherness and fun, making it seem more like a brain-strain puzzle rather than a game. And then you realise that the ratio of "meaningful decision turns" to "play-it-out turns" is astronomically low. The illusion of a wild number of alternative missions is blown as you realise just how few options the board really offers for most of the game, at least until you finally convert one of your basic cards into a more powerful ability. It just takes seemingly forever to get to that point. Not for fun-loving or casual gamers; probably best left for game theme masochists only.

I would technically rate High Frontier without the expansion lower, but I think it would be misleading since the expansion is really designed to always be used. Use the base game to learn (if you really think you need to) but once you've played the expansion, you wont want to go back.

RATING: 7
In this game, players are launching spacecraft to discover and colonize bodies in our solar system.  There's a ton of rules overhead here, and the game takes a while to play, but if anything, the game feels too short, as it ends rather abruptly just as players are starting to embark upon their more ambitious goals.  The beginning of the game goes very slowly, as players build up their income and work on their first projects.  The game seems to depend heavily on dice luck, as that determines if you can claim a body.  I really love this theme, and it seemed like there was a ton to explore in the game, but the game left me wishing I had more opportunity to explore, instead of having someone get lucky on the dice and end the game.

Not yet learned. Of many other games it can truly be said "It's only a game, it's not rocket science." This one IS rocket science, and it's a game. The map is gorgeous.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
At it's core, this is an incredibly simple game (or at least the base game is) slathered in a heap of hard science. This game could have easily been smoothed out around the edges, but it would lose what makes it special. The realistic science behind the game.

I feel like this game needs repeat plays to really appreciate it. Not to mention adding in the advanced rules and the colonization expansion. I've really only gotten in part of 1 play of it, but I very much enjoyed it. I think it probably plays best with 3-4 players as the auctions and racing elements being much more interesting. I also believe this is much more of a sandbox game than a victory point game (or at least at the beginning it is). It's really just fun to move about in space colonizing, getting new equipment and refueling on various planets/asteroids.

My only real problem with this game is that the rulebook is extremely poorly written for learning. It's literally not meant for learning the game. Referencing the rulebook is great, but man trying to get through it is a slog. I've found it easiest to learn the rules from the "learn to play" guide which is both humorous and informative. Then to either flip through the actual rulebook or to start on the alive and complete rules. The game becomes much, much easier to understand.

Extras: Cards sleeved, colored player mats on thick chipboard and the biggest Zazzle map (2013) I could buy.

Very clever and likeable game on space exploration with an emphasis on hard science. The may be more an 'experience game' than a balanced contest. Until played a couple of times it is hard to grok optimal strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Still discovering this but I think it's hard no to be impressed. The amount of science and detail is astonishing. A quick glance at the map is enough to scare the geekiest of geeks. 

To say that High Frontier is thematic is like saying there's water in the ocean. The cards, the notes in the rulebook, the art in the cards, the mechanics... the smell of vacuum is everywhere.

But it's also very interesting: just trying to put together a simple expedition to land and claim a site is quite the challenge to a beginner. There's a lot of stuff to pay attention to and travelling in space is neither as easy and as relaxing as it's made up to be. With experience, the operacional details become clearer and it becomes easier to plan ahead and to set long term goals. It's a race to the stars and there's a continuing trade off between setting up the perfect expedition and being quick enough to be the first to reach the desired landing site.

Very impressed and very eager to play more. Still haven't tried the expanded game which some say is the real game.

High Frontier is one of the coolest looking games I own.  The board and the card art are very well done.  

It has the right amount of chrome, chaos and strategy to fit my style.  Very frustrating at times.  NOT for the AP prone.  The rules / mechanics are very straightforward once you get into the game.  This an Origins are two masterpieces of gaming from Phil Eklund.

A paradox of a game for me. Convoluted rules and excessive chrome added to the expense of gameplay should make me run away from it.   

Yet I love it. To the point of being one of my favorites. The theme is phenomenally implemented and the core game is spot on for me. To plan missions and to combine cards to get a workable spaceships and then travel to the depths of the solar system to colonize it and produce better technology and bring them back to make better spaceships. Fantastic!

Okay as a "game" design this is flawed. The real player interaction is all in the technology auction and exchange. But pricing requires fairly deep understanding of each of the cards. This means casual players are disadvantaged. Also the game seems to end just as players feel they have finally got something started.

Be that as it may, the puzzle solving aspect is great and the theme elements are superb. The high rating has a lot to do with sheer love of the tech.

RATING: 7
I'm not sure it makes sense to rate High Frontier on the same scale as other games; it's certainly not interested in conventional criteria like elegance and balance. I was a bit wary of giving up my Sunday gaming to it as I tend to zone out of multi-hour games, esepcially ones where no one quite has a firm grip on the rules. But we followed advice on the 'geek to stick with the fast-start basic game and all diligently studied the rules and walkthrough. And it turned out to not only be shorter than I'd feared (about 3 hours) but also hugely immersive and engaging.

I've never encountered a game where at the start it seems so damn difficult to do anything, let alone explore the outer reaches of the solar system. At times it felt more like a support group than a competition, each of us helping out with tips for the others. But all this difficulty means that when you do finally put a successful mission together it's immensely satisfying. If you were rating it like just another Euro, there are all kinds of things that could be criticised - the insanely powerful Zubrin rocket I ended up with by chance, the single dice roll that crashed and burned a mission that had been hours in the planning. But this is anything but just another Euro, as you can see from the enthralling forum replies where Phil Eklund answers rules queries *by reference to the actual astrophysics*.

If you are looking for a fast light game, pass on this one.  Likewise, you won't want to push this game on the wrong crowd.  

If you understand physics, the rules are a lot easier to grok.  That said, the rules are actually quite simple.  Once you have played a couple games you understand it and the game mechanics are fast.  Then you start trying to plan strategy and the brilliance of the design becomes apparent.

People with Analysis Paralysis can spend a LONG time trying to find not just a good mission but the BEST mission.  Encourage such players to do this on their own time on solo games or implement a timer.

Having said all the above, this game is so cool!  You really feel like a NASA mission planner trying to figure out what you have to do to bring off a mission.

The victory points are set up so that there are a number of very different paths to victory.

I like things that can teach you something and this game does that as well.  

Too bad there is no mention of a Sky Ramp to lower costs to get into orbit.  (A Sky Ramp is an inclined rail on a mountain to get you higher and moving faster before the rocket fires.  The space shuttle uses 40% of its fuel to get up 1 km and going at Mach 1.  A sky ramp will halve its fuel requirements and make a single stage to orbit rocket a possibility.  Effectively it makes the big first stage fully reusable with a turn around time of minutes.)

----
Advice on what you should do on your first game:

If you are teaching the game, play a couple solo games first.  I am told there are some very good tutorials / walk thrus on BGG so you may wish to look them over.

The rules suggest that you 'game' the auctions to make money.  Typically you buy a tech you don't need for 1, sell it for 3 and make a profit of 2 over two turns.  You could do equally well just grabbing one water tank in orbit in those 2 turns, so I wonder about this advice.  On the other hand it cycles a lot of patents and gives new comers a chance to see what is in the deck.

I suggest that your first game you give each player a random technology in each category and a bit extra water in orbit.  Speeds things up, so if you make a mistake, not so much time was lost.

The first time you play, anyone who manages to complete a mission should be considered a winner.  You will want to play one game to learn the mechanics.

If you are playing with a new player, give them a crew card that includes a built in thruster.  (NASA, ESA or China.) Very handy to have a high thrust rocket along when you want to take off from a mid sized world.  With new players, try to have the ESA as one player.  The extra boost to thrust that can be sold will help everyone.

The Zubrin salt water nuclear rocket is not a typo.  The thing would really work in real life.  However, in the basic game this technology has all of the advantages and none of the disadvantages (namely no need for radiation shielding and no need to radiate waste heat), so it is unbalanced.  I suggest you take it out of the card mix when playing the basic game.

Many plays.  Now own the expansion.  Game is still a favorite. 

I rate this a 9 rather than a 10 because there are times when I feel like something lighter, so I wouldn't play it anytime.  But I won't get to play this as often as I would like.

RATING: N/A
The map of this game is stunning, showing lines of equal energy to establish routes and orbits. Some of the other cards don't quite come up to the same quality but the game does give a really interesting experience in its first half (which misleadingly lasts about 90% of the game). Players buy, sell, trim, and transport parts to assemble ships in orbit around the Earth trying to work out how to manage mass, fuel, and equipment to achieve a meaningful trip to another planet. This is a real brain-burner section and genuinely feels like you are running a primitive operation to reach another planet.
The second half once you have all got your ships running and they can zip around the system is less interesting but it doesn't last long before the game end condition kicks in.
I enjoyed this but it was fiddly and inelegant in places and I can imagine a lot of players really hating the number crunching and accountancy of it all.

Fascinating system that is much more simulation than game. Very difficult to grasp how to move around efficiently and to do anything. Only after playing a couple of times do things start to click. The biggest problem, and what keeps it from being a 10, is that unless you really know what you're doing (and I still don't) you spend a lot of turns cycling through cards buying/selling to build up enough WT to do something.

--Feb2011-- Perplexingly interesting.  Rules (as provided in box, at least; living rules are distinctly better) are dense and hard to navigate.  The game seems sensible, but we struggled with a variety of things - only iterating to a playable version after a couple hours of misguided exploration.  I'm very much interested in playing again - and hope that I can digest enough of the rules to play cleanly without much in-game reference.  Lots of room for improvement in enjoyment and rating with additional study.

Replayability may be hurt a bit by the puzzle-like aspect of working out missions, but the poster map adds so many possibilities (with busted mines especially) that I'm not all that worried.

Excellent, creative, thinking 'out the box' game. My only real complaint may be the fact that pursuing ones goals and pursuing victory in this game are often not the same thing!

The ending can actually arrive unexpectedly if you are very absorbed in your own missions (ie: not paying close enough attention to what other players are up to). 

That said, High Frontier is a beautifully constructed, unique experience that, once you are familiar with the system, provides very rewarding 'play.'

Update: finally played a 3p with some friends. First play took about 4 hours, which didn't feel bad at all (both other players commented that it didn't seem like that long). Brain-burning, yet satisfying when you succeed at whatever you were trying to do. A tough game, but one that doesn't seem like would be as fun if you made it any easier. Looking forward to more plays - definitely a keeper for me.

-I want to like Phil Eklund games due to how he integrates themes so heavily into the mechanics, but his games feel more like simulations or homework rather than anything that enjoyable to actually experience.

This is an interesting game.   It reminds me of the kinds of role playing simulations I worked on in science museums in which we created land-use simulations, spacecraft construction simulations, etc. to provide people a sense of how these kinds of tasks are managed in the "real world".  To be honest, I'm not even looking at this game in terms of its game play.  It's fun to just wade around in the content (like Martin Schweiger's "Orbiter" simulation available online).  The additional expansion board (which I obtained, somehow, I'm not even sure exactly how) doubles the size of the explorable solar system by adding Saturn and some additional moons, politics and combat, as well.

In some ways this is a ground-breaking game.  Granted it is not going to suit everyone, but for those that appreciate the design and science behind the game this is a real gem.

The comments that this is more of a simulation than a game does have a ring of truth about it.  It is mentally demanding and the game that challenges my mental dexterity the most.  I'm actually quite poor at the game but I appreciate the challenge and the uniqueness.  

I'm grateful to the designer for making something different for a change.  [b]The board-game industry needs to start designing more games like HF, that chart new territory.[/b]

The basic version feels more like a series of planning exercises than a real game; the advanced game adds more risk elements to spice things up. It appears that the two 'halves' of the game were designed to go together and were then split up. This is unlike anything I've ever played; always a good thing!

This game arrived two days ago (22/10/10).  I am so impressed with the amount of work that has gone into it.  It's beautiful and brainy and inspiring all at once.  So far, I've stepped through some missions and am ready to play tomorrow.  I won't rate it yet, but I've already had so much enjoyment out of looking at the board, and cards, and extra details in the rules that I had to post a comment.

High Frontier is a a beautiful game.  But the say that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  In this case the board is stunning but overwhelming.  The The rules once absorbed are fairly straightforward, but take awhile to absorb.  The map is accurate to the solar system.  The trajectories, the planet and planetoids are all based on our actual solar system.  The cards are all based on near(?) future technology (or at least what real rocket scientists think is likely for "exoglobalization".  But consulting with astrophysicists, and NASA engineers makes an accurate simulation, it almost necessarily makes the game unbalanced, almost wildly so.  

There is a neat mechanic in which each planetary body has a numeric value and a type, listed as 10C, 3S, 1M as examples.  The type is important if you plan on building a factory, the numeric value is an indication of mass.   The clever part is the higher the number the more likely it is to find resources on the planet; but the more fuel it takes to land and take-off from the planetoid.  

The unbalance comes from the reality of the solar system.  There are only a limited amount of close juicy targets.  The same goes for technology cards, there are a couple cards that may be wildly unbalanced.  The 15. – ½ thruster is at least twice as good as the next best rocket in the game.  It can literally go three times farther and at half of the fuel cost of then next best rocket.  This ridiculous combination can carry any amount of mass you need in robonasuts and refineries, (the two items you need for a factory) to almost as far as you want to go in one turn, and f you didn’t go far, you will have enough fuel for a return trip.  An absolute luxury compared to the other rockets which seem to require tedious fuel calculations to eek out the optimal target for exploration and tough decisions on how much mass they can get there.  

Even with the flaws, the game is a masterpiece, beauty to behold and a great experience to play.  I would play it again anytime.

What an extraordinary experience it is exploring this game. But I do think the designer went way over the top with the scientific application and tech talk. 

Probably the most intimidating map I've yet run across in four decades of boardgaming, yet it is also one of the most intriguing. I rec'd the larger Zazzle map as a gift from a friend.

The rulebook is actually not that bad, though too many concepts are obfuscated. It just takes a LOT of time to digest. It's like having a big bag of puzzle pieces but no box top, so it's hard to visualize what the end result is meant to be. The latest Alive & Complete rules are much better.

Creative, innovative, and quite daunting, High Frontier is one of those rare designs that I think about all the time but it just doesn't make it to the gaming table. In other words, HF is more admired than played, sadly enough.

Quite possibly the most brilliant design I've ever encountered in the hobby, this game is freakishly fascinating beyond compare. I just wish that I could internalize the game better so that it would get played more often.

It requires a very specific mindset to enjoy this game: it's more a simulator than a game, really, and having some basic understanding of astrophysics does help a lot. Also, it's very complicated, even more so as several mechanics (the decommissioning of technology) are rather counter-intuitive.
But once you get in the right mindset, the game is simply mindblowing.

I hadn't played any Sierra Madre Games games before, but they always sounded interesting. I hadn't tried any before because I wasn't sure I'd like them and wasn't willing to just buy one to give it a shot. But now a friend of mine bought High Frontier.

The game took us a good 2.5 hours and there where a good amount of rules questions and things we did wrong. This is almost as much of a simulation as it is a game, which is why this game is so interesting to me. I totally dig the theme, of course.

I enjoyed playing this and didn't feel it outstayed it's welcome. I also feel that now that we know the game, it will speed up significantly (after a rules reread, to iron out the errors)

Very complex with a lot going on, but you already knew that, didn't you?

Well worth the many hours it took us to struggle through our first play.

I am still unsold on the Eklund graphic design class however.

I rate some other games as 10s because they are brilliant games.  This is not a brilliant game.  It is a clunky, awkwardly-paced, brutally callous game that delights in the tears of its players.  I am rating it as a system for applying high-voltage shocks to the imagination.  

No, one does not play High Frontier to compete.  One plays to dream. This is as close as any of us will ever get to planning interplanetary missions.  Now, maybe you are the type of unimaginative sod who does not care for interplanetary missions.  That's fine.  Well, no, not really -- it marks you as a doofus with no sense of wonder at the universe.  You can probably overcome that, though, and if you do, you will like High Frontier.  It is a thrilling game, in its complexity and occasional (i.e., frequent) misfortunes.  And it makes one feel both very small and fragile and very expansive and very aware of all the wondrous conglomerations of matter zooming just out of reach.

It's odd but I feel like I'm part of a brotherhood when I play this.  From here on out BGG is two groups of people -- those who adore High Frontier and those who don't.  Those of you who don't like it may be wonderful people and I am happy to play other games with you.  But those of us up here with our 10 ratings have tasted something you'll never feel.

This is probably awesome & I just need to give Version 2 another shot. The map makes me lustful. For some unknown reason I just couldn't get into it tho, I couldn't muster the proper gumption. Perhaps the subject is just too hardware oriented & I don't get the same 'ideas' hit I get from other Sierra Madre titles.

It felt interminable & given it was, in the end, a puzzle rather than an interactive wonder that Sierra Madre pits out so very well, I just found the dice phone & the silly auctions driving the part swapping didn't jive with building a space program.

A great game for the right person, just not me.

June 2016: Sold on Geek Market to fund purchase of new 3rd edition.

I had to read the rules for this game numerous times, but beneath the tech manual rulebook and crazy looking board is a pretty accessible game. You have 8 actions you can do and a rocket to move along lines.

I didn't know a whole lot about rocket science so the rulebook and jargon was a barrier, which is a shame. This game is brilliantly designed, and is so satisfying to play.

You definitely need a patient group to get this to the table, but if you have any interest in space and your gaming group can wade through Mage Knight, heavy euros, or any of GMT's games, this is a must try.

One of the most absorbing games I've playing in recent years and yet I'm still crap at it. All you're doing is moving a little plastic rocket ship around the inner solar system, finding stuff and setting up factories, yet every single successful step is it's own reward. Despite the daunting rule book, quite a straightforward game, just incredibly immersive. A must for any hard sf fan.

After first play I have a slight idea what actually to do. My first two flights went nowhere and even when I managed to land on Venus there was nothing I could do there. What was I thinking! We had fun though and I'm looking forward to the next play.


Essen 2010, Preordered.
The game with the most unusual board ever. The theme is space-exploration without the fantasy crap like monsters and aliens, so scientifically approved. The only problem I foresee is that it will never fit on our weekly game-evenings.

Couldn't resist after being hypnotized by the maps; preordered and thus the very first 100% sure purchase at Spiel.
Contains also High Frontier Expansion, with the other half of the stunning map.

Darilian's ramblings have convinced me this one would be good to try.  Should probably play it first.

Well, Secret Granta threw this into the pile.  Now we have to get it out some decade. :)

I'm going to leave this at a 7 since we're nowhere near good enough at rocketry to even consider this a game.  But I like it and want to play it more.

And there sits the problem.  After 10 games of this, 6 of those in this month, our rocketry skills are still quite varied and any actual game has not made itself known.  If you know what your doing, or happen to get a decent rocket out while your betters suffer some unfortunate events, you can avoid the "yeah, I did as best as I could but got trounced" feeling.

While I like the idea of a living ruleset and a living board, sometimes it's just not worth the effort to try learning this one.

This game is so unlike other games that I have a hard time knowing what it is, game or just a simplified boardgame-disguised simulation. The gameplay feels like it should be boring and achieving any results is very difficult, but somehow I really feel like I'm in charge of a space agency. Even managing a trip to the moon is a huge effort and the feeling of satisfaction is awesome once you finally get there. All in all I don't know what this is but I know it has been a long time since I smiled so much after a game. Oh and special satisfaction for the laughs when your competitors spaceship burns up in the mars atmosphere... and pity when it happens to them over and over again. Some people can't catch a break.

After third game of playing with correct rules but still basic game: I feel ready to move to a slightly expanded game, Colonization modules still feels lightyears away. And my rating of 10 is strengthened even more. This is the perfect experience, but I'm still not sure whether it is a game or simulation and I still don't care about who wins.

Fifth game where we first tried a slightly expanded game and added rocket support modules, slingshots and radiation belts. Wow, just as I thought the base game rocket building was getting easy this comes in and kicks me in the groin. It adds to the gametime, at least in the beginning. It makes the game as a whole a lot better. The auction is no longer boring and repetitive. But with the full rocket building rules this game becomes extremely complex. Our playgroup was definately not a bunch of casual stupid kimble players, quite the opposite, but the game throws such a huge challenge that even though rules are relatively simple and logical in the background the possible combinations of rocket/mission planning become very tough to wrap your head around.

All being said, this game is really not for everyone and the expanded game proved that, but I personally found the holy grail of boardgames. Space-nerds and gamers capable of handling the challenge are guaranteed to get their kicks from this while others might find it frustrating and never leave LEO.

Brilliant game with a heavy use of theme and very very hard decisions to be made.

Update: Even after over a dozen plays, I just like the game even more. The ship parts are well-balanced and there are plenty of locations that are achievable early on making it a game of "know how to do the best with what you have" instead of "grab the best ship parts and planets before others do".

I enjoy the theme and the science in this game very much.  It's fascinating to see how well things are modeled, and the game does indeed work as a simulation.  The gameplay, though, is borderline functional.  Though the rules for burns vs. fuel vs. thrust hew quite closely to simulation, it does make them a beast to understand.  Every player I've introduced this to has had a difficult time internalizing it.  But, it's an admirable game, and there's nothing else in this genre that comes even close to this level of fidelity, so it's definitely worth seeking out and playing.

The basic game is actually very simple (really just 5 pages - not much different than a Euro) - it just takes a long time to get to that understanding because it is wrapped up in a lot of extraneous information.

My comment is based on the basic game.  Space exploration is a math and science puzzle.  And this game is a math puzzle with abstracted rocket science while also being a crap-shoot with exploration & exploitation.  The map is lovely and fun to just pore over.  Much of the heavy-lifting of mission planning rocket science is represented on the map via pre-mapped routes and their corresponding resource requirements.  The science behind the theme is at the fore because that is the game.  I don't expect to understand rocket science in detail, but I do expect thematic intuitiveness in understanding game play.  I found the real science reproduced in abstracted ways that muddied matters.  Players tend to their own business resulting in little interaction at all, then again space is a lonely place.  Maybe the learning curve is steep and I'm just not being patient.  Or maybe it's too much sandbox and not enough game for me.  The biggest drawback is the time commitment required to play.  Regardless, I'm willing to give it another go because I feel I should like it more than I do.

I have tremendous respect for Phil Eklund's dedication to scientific literacy and high-end intellectual pursuit.  But if Mr. Eklund designed a kitchen "game", it would work like this:

Materials - Blender, pile of tokens, die

Phase 1: Players take turns either (a) taking one token from the token pool or (b) auctioning a token.  In the case of an auction, players must spend their already-accrued tokens to bid on the new token.  Once all players are in possession of at least 175 tokens, move onto Phase 2.

Phase 2: Each player cashes in 175 tokens and rolls a die.  Any player who rolls a "1" may turn on the blender and let it run for any amount of time.  If the blender smokes and overheats on a player's turn, that player must build a new blender from spare parts and continue.  

[i]Note:[/i] Players who do not roll a "1" in Phase 2 immediately lose the game.

Scoring: Players who run the blender for exactly 3 minutes score 5 points, and players who run the blender for exactly 8 minutes score 10 points.  Any other time selection results in zero points. 

Would you call that a game?  If so, I don't think you'd call it a fun game, a fair game, or an interesting game. You'd call it a waste of time and an insult to kitchen appliances everywhere.

If you want a [i]fun[/i] simulation of space exploration, you should either wrap yourself in foil and run around the front yard or play any space-related video game.  If desired, read a graduate-level physics text to catch up on the latest advances in astrophysics.  Just don't play High Frontier.

Also, High Frontier is Not A Game.  It's a simulation.  The designer isn't trying to hide this fact, I don't think, but other people appear to be.  In fact, High Frontier is sufficiently Not A Game that I don't think it should be listed on BGG - just like blenders shouldn't be listed on BGG because a delusional lover of appliances found a way to make them game-like.

However, if you're willing to put up with a few games where you fail miserably and you take the time to really learn how to play this, you'll be rewarded with one of the most incredible gaming experiences ever, and one that just keeps on getting better and better the more you play it.

----------------------------
Within you get a great auction game [i](with inherently [u]un[/u]balanced items)[/i], you get exploration and expansion, pickup & deliver, and even a little bit of chance, all wrapped up in an awesome sciencey shell.  This [i]is[/i] rocket science.

There's a crapload of stuff in the rules to this game, but once you get the core rules down it's a lot less complicated than it at first appears.  It can take several plays just to get a feel for how everything ties together, and then several more to really get good at it.

There is some math involved but it's pretty basic stuff [i](just some minor addition and subtraction)[/i].

If you're just starting out, don't even look at the expansion until you played the "basic" game at least three or four times.  The expanded game components are an absolute must-have, but the complexity they add to rocket construction and movement will only cause confusion when you're still trying to figure out the basics.  The events and political track add even more layers of complexity that can quickly overwhelm if you're not up to speed on everything else first.  Colonization is another step beyond, and you have to work your way up to it.   Most people will drown if they try jumping straight into this deep end.



Also, if you're even slightly interested in this game, make sure to get the giant poster map.   36x24 is almost an exact match for the original board plus the expansion, but if you've got the table space for it, bigger is better.

Wow, this game is a blast!  It's very clear how to play the game, mechanics-wise, but playing well is going to be a long learn.  I've played a 2-player game with my son and a 5-player game with gamers, both using only the basic rules and map.  

There's a whole lot going on.  It was only towards the final quarter of the last game that we started to realize that paying attention to the black side of the cards on auction was a good idea.  Maybe we're slow.

Speaking of that, you have to enjoy the slow build-up of the game or you probably either won't like the game or you'll have to use the quick-start.  It doesn't seem to be a rip-roaring experience at the beginning (especially if you don't use the quick-start variant, as we didn't), but I like seeing how the various players slowly start to differentiate from one another and set off after sometime competing and sometimes disparate goals.  Plenty of opportunity for subtle interaction in the base game, and it looks like more overt interaction in the advanced game.  I hope to find out.

Fascinating game. Will require a ton of plays to fully grok.

Rating removed until next edition decides to materialize.

very interesting and deep game of space exploration.  i wouldn't expect any less from Phil Eklund.  You don't really need to understand the concept behind the game to enjoy the play, and that is a good thing, because this is hard stuff.  the game itself is difficult, and probably needs a couple plays at least to understand what you are doing.  the map is brilliant, looks great and serves it's purpose splendidly. look forward to playing this more in the future.

2012-09-25:  Tentative rating:  Intricate, even for the basic game, but very appealing.  I am itching to play this.
2013-06-17:  Don't play this game on a very, very empty stomach, nine months after your first play.  It's a little too intricate to recall well, which can diminish enjoyment greatly.  There are a handful of counterintuitive notions that make this more challenging than it really is.  Oh, also, don't play with five players unless they all five know what they're doing!  I'm still itching to play this again, because I remember loving it, and now I had a bad experience with it, but know that I loved it.  Must set the record straight!

The economy system is broken. The endless cycle of the same patents being researched and then sold over and over again is boring and repetitive. Otherwise, the hardcore science, the difficulty, the theme and the art are wonderful.

The expansion introduces a nice map extension and adds technology cards for much needed complexity in interesting decision making, but the random event table kills all the fun. Having your hard work nullified over and over again by unlucky die rolls discourages players from ever finishing the game.

Rating is estimate after one solo and one three player game, both with basic rules. After slow start of what-the-heck I should do now, this game starts to flow smoothly. At the moment I'm loving this game. More thoughts after couple of games more.

The only simulation amongst games. A bit faulty as a game (dealing with auctions and collecting cards in particular, dynamic and timing of different phases of the game also), but unique and perfect as a simulation. That makes it also the only hard SF made of cardboard. I think I would never trade it despite the fact that my girlfriend hates it (she even cried over it out of frustration) so I usually don't have anyone to play with.

This is one of those games that looks like it needs a physics degree to understand. However, once you do start playing it becomes a lot simpler and fun.

01/02/14 -- This game stands up well to infinity replays.  I'd better bump up my rating.

12/19/11 -- Rating 8:  This game is fascinating for several reasons.  It's incredibly loyal to the science of space travel, yet sacrifices for the sake of good-gaminess whenever it needs to.  The challenge of planning and executing missions is utterly engaging and the sense of satisfaction upon completion, or frustration from an error or disaster, are immensely satisfying.  High Frontier is a game with a good narrative arc and doesn't over-stay its welcome.  Overall one of the best and most innovative games I've seen from the past few years.

Getting new players into it can be somewhat challenging since the concepts of space travel are foreign to most of us, even though the game itself is not inherently complex.  New players should really consider their first game to be just a learning exercise that should (provided they're not crazy) leave them excited for their first real game.  In my opinion, the most difficult concept for noobz to grasp is that thrust/acceleration and fuel efficiency/consumption are not directly correlated and that establishing space factories often requires ISRU refueling somewhere and/or separate trips for delivering the robonaut and reactor.

One other thing:  If playing the basic game, I definitely recommend using the following 2 advanced rules:  
-Jettisons
-Dirt as Propellant

Busting Deimos from the get-go is probably also a good idea.

I'm looking forward to the advanced game, but unlike with some games, there really is no need to rush.

As always from Sierra Madre, this is a really excellent simulation.  But, it is really hard to develop the first stage of solar exploration due to its serious simulating.

Above average game play.  Fantastic miniatures.  We regularly utilize the miniatures in our table top RPG sessions due to their detail and accurate representation of Monstrous manual entries. 

While the D&D big box game minis are good, these minis are better as the have the great sculpting as well as being pre painted.

Low-medium complexity fantasy miniatures skirmish game.  It is themed around D&D 4th edition, but has little in common with that game.  Creatures automatically hit when they attack and do a fixed amount of damage (which can be boosted or reduced by card play).  It's fine, but doesn't excite me.  I would prefer to have dice rolls to liven things up.  The miniatures are quite nice for pre-painted minis.  Including cards to use the minis with the [family=9547]D&D Adventure System board games[/family] is brilliant.

Quick and deadly faction, with minor cards that allow them to get extra melee attacks in addition to their standard ones. Also have cards that enable them to dart in and out of combat. However, the attacks are slightly weaker than other factions (don't do as much damage) and also the units are a bit more fragile compared the other factions.

RATING: 9
This game plays very well, with adequate chance for battles to swing back and forth depending on timing and unit positioning. There are noticeably different characteristics that make each army different while remaining balanced. It will become better and better as more and more sets come out, provided that WotC can maintain balance across those factions.

I don't like to deck build. Fortunately, playing the warbands as they were designed is thematically sound. It feels similar to Summoner Wars, but without dice, and with different resource management mechanics. You don't build magic, just try to put whatever you need out when you need it, as much as you can (given your limited leadership).

The miniatures, while not stunning, separate Dungeon Command from other skirmish games. The fact that this game can almost always be found for less than $30 makes it a good value for what you get.

Specific to Sting of Lolth:
- Fairly low damage unit set (few units above 20 damage).
- Above-average agility units that offer interesting ways to maneuver around your opponent.

RATING: 6.3
By themselves, the Dungeon Command games are decent, but nothing special. 12 miniatures to battle with, four tiles, and a small deck of cards does not really offer much variety and you HAVE To buy another set to really play. Put the costs together, and it is questionable whether it is worth it for just 24 units. But it is a solid game despite this problems. BUT... if you own any of the D&D cooperative games, you can ALSO add the miniatures to that for more variety there! My rating is based solely on the game as a stand-alone, but I really own it as an expansion for my Wrath of Ashardalon and Castle Ravenloft games.

I liked playing this a lot. There is some opportunity for strategy (especially if you have ranged attackers and you can block their melee fighters), but mostly it's silly smashing fun.
It seems like the game would degenerate quickly if my friends and I started building our own armies. Clearly the person who bought more would have a huge advantage. So we're only playing starters out of the box, and in that case it's a lot of fun.

Well presented: very nice pre-painted minis; quality art on cards; map on hard stock. I love the fact the that monsters can be directly integrated into other D&D board game sets (Castle Ravenloft, et al) without rules adjustments (brilliant in its simplicity).  I like the idea of various factions and hope that WoC pursues further sets. Basic, fun stand alone skirmish game. The small map squares, however, do not accomidate the minis.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Dungeon Command has been compared to games like Star Wars: Epic Duels, Summoner Wars, and Magic: The Gathering, and there are certainly elements of all of those here. Dungeon Command is primarily a tactical minis game, with movement and positioning being crucial to victory. However, it is also a card game (hence the Magic comparisons) and hand management plays a big role as well.

Each player controls an army of 12 figures and a deck of 30 or more cards. A figure has an inherent movement, attack value, and special abilities. But all of these can be enhanced by playing cards on them. Knowing when to play these cards and how to position your figures are two of the biggest choices the game offers. Despite having diceless combat, almost nothing in this game is calculable, which I love. There is never an obviously right answer for how far you should move, whether you should get a treasure, whether to stay together or split up, to play a card or not, to cower (which hits your morale) or not (which kills your units), and so many other choices.

For a relatively simple rule set, I think Dungeon Command offers a ton of meaningful choices and a depth of gameplay that will require many games to master. None of that even takes into account the additional layer of customizable army/deck-building. This one is a winner.

Played with 2 players and 1 Faction Pack, this game is terrible. My Girlfriend and I were really looking forward to this, and the game seemed sluggish and fairly predicable after the first few turns.

Played with 2 players and 2 Faction Pack (the way the game was designed), this game is much much much better.  As a tabletop gamer, I like that this game combines the tactical strategies of Heroclix and other minis games with the card fighting aspect of Magic that my girlfriend enjoys.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (February 2013)

I just realized the game has no dice, and that is very attractive for me, however as this game was compared to Mage Wars and Summoner Wars I had huge hopes for it but I was disappointed. I need to give Dungeon Command another chance, as my only game was rushed. 

In my game, I felt I didn’t have a lot of control, the choices were easy in general (low tension), I dislike the treasure as it adds uncontrollable luck, the cards are low quality (sleeve ASAP), the Rulebook is also of low quality (I feel like reading a newspaper)  and (most important for me) the game is not as deep as I have hoped for :( (I wish to be wrong about this). Also I didn’t feel the theme at all, as I know about the D&D world I could imagine it but Mage Wars has more theme IMO. The miniatures are gorgeous though. 

So far, the only advantage it has over Mage Wars and Summoner Wars is that this game has actual miniatures. 

For now, I will play again and see what happen, if I like the game, I will later comment on the Sting of Loth Army.

After the success of Mage Wars, desire to play Dungeon Command is very low. I have to rate it accordingly. Also I believe (but I’m not 100% sure) that the game was canceled. It is a shame because the D&D world has lots of potential

This game sits squarely between Magic: The Gathering and Summoner Wars for me--and takes the place of both in my collection. Cool painted minis (that are compatible with the D&D Adventure System games) liven up the presentation but the real hook here is that diceless, card-driven gameplay combined with a decent little tactical miniatures game.

Played the playtest, used more up to date rules correcting playtest materials (that is, made up some proxies). The game plays quickly and smoothly and with some getting used-to (untapping at the beginning and end of turn!) games will never drag on or get bogged down in rules.

I would highly recommend this for someone looking for a simplified skirmish miniatures game, or anyone who plays Magic: the Gathering but has wondered what the game would be like with miniatures.

All in all, the D&D R&D department at Wizards has been putting out some high-quality stuff of late (Lords of Waterdeep, Adventure Series, etc.) and this is easily my favorite of that body of work. Easy to get into and fun to play.

Dungeon Command is a Dungeons & Dragons card-driven skirmish game played on modular interlocking map tiles that uses action cards, creature cards and miniatures.

RATING: N/A
I was sent a review copy of Heart of Cormyr and the Sting of Lolth sets and a pal and I took a shot at it. Unfortunately I can't really say much about it. This might be the best skirmish-level miniatures game out there but I have no way of knowing because skirmish-level miniatures games are just not my thing. They're worse than not my thing -- I don't enjoy playing them that much. I try to play them but end up ever so carefully moving my guys around and then watching them get slaughtered because I just never have any idea what I should be doing. They're not fun to me. This one didn't change that, but again, that doesn't say anything about this game in particular because for all I know, people who like this sort of thing love this instance of it. I am probably going to pass my review copies on to someone who will have a better shot at enjoying this.

Dungeon Command is grossly under-rated skirmish game pitting two factions against each other in a dungeon or outdoor setting.  Game play is card driven and there are no dice.  It very much has a 4th edition D&D combat feel but without the d20.

2 / 5 - Fair 

Some good ideas here, especially around mix & matching sets and the maneuver aspects. However the game is spoiled by its reliance on order cards to generate excitement and tension - combat is 100% predictable without them and they tend to run out quite fast. Monsters are good as expansion to Legend of Drizzt though. Review: http://www.nohighscores.com/2012/09/21/dungeon-command-review/

Not your average miniatures game, and quite a good one based on playing with untampered (uncustomized) base boxes. Its card-driven gameplay is a pleasant surprise; it won't show much subtlety at first, but the factions, or even the different leaders offer significantly different strategies. 

For going the extra mile, and including cards for their D&D Adventure line for full compatibility makes it a very easy decision if I wanted to stay for the upcoming boxes in the series.

Review here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/878246/ninjadorgs-dungeon-command-review

There’s a deceptive amount things happening at once in this game, and it feels like there is always something to be doing, even during your opponent’s turn.  Because of the nature of the card play, you can play some effects during your opponent’s attacks, deflecting blows or escaping from attack, or Cowering.  The upshot of this is that the downtime feels very minimal once you both have a handle on the game, although some decisions can be appropriately agonising.

When I first bought these dungeon command games, I did it only for the miniatures and the tiles, as assets for d&d games. Yesterday after almost 4 years, me and my friends, decided to give them a shot as game.
The game is really interesting, both generals and the races can change a lot the game. It can be played with 3 and 4 people (we tried it both). Havent played the 2 player version yet, but the multiplayer system was great.
Strategy,  wargame, great miniatures and great cards. You have a lot to think, where to move, where to hide, what cards to use, which one to attack and with whom to hold peace. I am glad to have this in my collection. Loved the experience and my friends and wife, already ask for the next gamenight. Try it with multiplayer and have fun!

The game elements are developed almost flawlessly.  Everything here is tightly intertwined and stripped down for a taught, competitive and balanced game experience.

On the negative side, this game is missing it's reason-to-be.  I'm not sure where this game fits into the larger gaming scene.  It's just another thing you might dabble in, even though it is very good, it doesn't have a ton of magnetism in a glutted market.

Also, the cards have decent art but are a bit thin, and the boards are prone to warping, and the figures are a bit small and uninspiring.  Production values obviously match the price point...still, it isn't a top shelf production physically.

This is the game system I was looking for all the time. Dungeons, dragons, M:tG-like gameplay... looking forward for more sets!

Great tactical. Not our thing, but very enjoyable. Furthermore, the pieces work for the Dungeons and Dragons system, which is awesome.

I've played the dungeon command series twice now.
It is too early for me to write very much.

It has an interesting combat system.  The default has no randomness, but player may (but don't have to) modify the results with cards.

Best with two players.  Feels a bit old school, a bit modern.  I do not see any joy in customizing, though.

[b]Pros:[/b]
- Great replayability and variability due to:
--- random card drawing from deck
--- re-positioning of 4 board pieces
--- (so far) 5 very different factions 
--- different positioning and thus strategy of your warband every time
- Beautiful painted miniatures
- Beautiful cards
- Factions are balanced
- You can assemble your own Warband from more than 1 faction

[b]Cons:[/b]
- Lacks mechanic that will make fighting necessary (one player can just hide in convenient place and "wait until the other guy will step into the trap").
- Game under 3 hours are very rare
- There is no point to play it as 3-player game (there is no game mechanic against "hide and wait" strategy until other 2 players fight between each other)

It's Miniatures the Gathering. Mechanics remind me of Magic, you need to buy multiple sets to play at a tournament levels, yes, there will be tournaments, and yes, there are promo cards and figures (alternative art). The sculpts are reused from the D&D Miniatures line. If you play HeroScape, see if HeroScapers has made army cards for the miniatures. If you play the D&D Adventure System, DC comes with Monster cards for the miniatures (Heroes of Cormyr has Ally cards). Heroes has a ridiculous purple and gold paint scheme.

Bought after Summoner Wars for a similar type of game but it seemed to me and my group that it was more of a math problem than a game.

Counting spaces to keep things in range of your archer and such.

Summoner Wars gives the same tactical feel without the unnecessary complexities.

RATING: 8
Fun game, but the price is a bit steep considering you need to have any 2 different sets to have any real fun. And forget customizing unless you want to buy a duplicate set... Seriously, $50 MSRP just to customize ONE army! and to play a good game with 2 of the 5 factions out at this time your at $100.... They need to include duplicates in each set at this price point. Or at least sell individual characters and command card sets. That said, I still bought all of them once and enjoy playing...

This set seems to be the weakest in the mix, I love the concept of the spider creatures but they are tricky to use effectively, there ultimate strength is movement so they need to be played a certain way, a way I still need to practice.
I noticed that there is a level 6 card in the deck but no creature with level 6?! That must be a wrong print, we will use that card as a level 5 card so that the army of Lolth can use that card!
(more concerning DC in general in my Curse of Undeath comment)

Excellent tactical miniatures game with smooth, unusual rules. On a player's turn they activate all of their creatures one at a time; creatures get one move, one "standard action" and any number of "minor actions". Other than certain basic standard actions (e.g. attack), most actions come in the form of order cards, one of the two collectible/deck-construction elements of the game. Combat is diceless, but certain abilities and order cards ("Immediate") can be played in response to attacks, allowing for the same sort of hail-mary saves that you might get with dice. It works very well.

A player can have in play creatures with levels totalling their leadership score, which increases each round. This works astonishingly well: not only does it give the game a satisfying arc (more and better creatures come out as the game progresses), it adds a strong strategic dimension because killing off weak units isn't a no-brainer. Removing units from the table frees up leadership points to be used for more reinforcements.

The trick is that a player loses when morale reaches zero, and morale goes down by 1 point per level of each dead creature, so it isn't necessary to wipe the enemy out completely to defeat them.

Other features I haven't seen in a skirmish game are the rules for LOS and dodging, which sound clunky but work very well, and the ability of creatures to "cower" -- avoid damage in exchange for morale.

The biggest problem with the game is that it is, in theory, collectible: with some restrictions, players can build their own warband and their own decks of order cards. The result is one of the best CCGs of all time (...with miniatures), if not for the fact that it is expensive, impractical and largely unthematic to actually do so.

The flipside of collectible [i]potential[/i] is always that starter decks/sets suffer in ways that correctly constructed decks do not, such as lack of consistency. In Sting of Lolth, for example, the Wisdom orders like Lolth's Blessing are valuable if and only if you draw the single Drow Priestess. This luck would normally be mitigated in competitive play by creating a more consistent deck (e.g. with multiple copies of critical cards), but the expense of the boxed faction format makes that extremely expensive. Worse, in order to provide more variety in the sets, each warband has undesirable and unthematic variety (why do the dark elves have an allied Umber Hulk?). As I have no interest in the customization, this is an irritation that will never go away.

It's a superb system, but for me the experience falls annoyingly short. It's so close to being great.

I was concerned that the drow wouldn't hold up as they seem to be very fragile but I've since seen them win games - I suspect they're much better in 1v1 rather than a 4 player free for all. 

I was mildly concerned about replayability, but since each turn you should only see about a third of your order cards and maybe a half of your creatures this should easily last 5 or 6 plays - at which point you change up the opposing army.

It doesn't feel particularly chaotic either, though I'd really only recommend the 2 player game...

Less a game and more a component set so I'd argue doesn't need a separate listing (lots of that on BGG though). The game system (Dungeon Command) is simple, yet fun. The drawback is not particularly well-balanced forces, and a lack of game support (ei new minis/cards) after buying basic faction boxes.

Descent little skirmish game. If the intent was that you could customize your own army ala Magic or something, then they went at this the wrong way. Each set retails at $40 and there are no individual or partial sets for purchase. 

The offerings aren't bad, but I don't really get why they went away from Heroscape. They could have stuck with Heroscape and started including the cards like they did. Rather than the map tiles, they could have just made the sets use the Heroscape set and gotten much better sales and broader appeal.

Much more than a kill-all-the-other-guys to win game . Coordinating monsters deployed with available cards and knowing when to play them is crucial. Hopefully newer factions won't creep up in power. First two boxes make for a competetive and balanced skirmish. 90 minutes of quality play with very short set up time.

I'm liking it, dice or no dice.  In fact, it's the fact that there's no dice that appeal to me.  The theme is there but there's less immersion into it which is fine since I see this game as a fast fantasy slugfest with D&D figures.  It really is MtG meets D&D minis.

I had high hopes for this, but found the combat a bit meh.  The abilities of the creatures were blah, the order cards were nothing special, and the guaranteed hits and damage made this too predictable.

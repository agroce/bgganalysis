While this game was plenty of fun, I absolutely had to make some rules changes. The game was confusing and no one I played it with could get a hold of the rules. We dumbed it down and now everyone enjoys it. It's a great work out for writers if you have writer's block.

I bought this game because of the roleplaying mechanic, since I was just a RPG-player at the time and I was just starting with boardgames. 

The game's fun after all, when you play it with the right people at the right time. It can really bring some laughter, but it's not a game to take from the shelf too often. After few consecutive plays it loses a lot.

RATING: 7
The obvious comparison is with Once Upon A Time.  Both are card-based storytelling games, heavily dependent on the imagination and quick wits of the players.  Where Once... can degenerate into a race to discard your cards, Dark Overlord cleverly sidesteps that issue; player minions get "withering looks" from the Overlord for excessive hesitation, incoherence or bungled service - the first to three loses and ends the round).  The player designated as the Overlord can bring structure to a narrative that is rambling or irrelevant.  This also gives the game a quite different feel to Once...  

It's not all good.  It is essential to have action cards that allow you to pass the blame.  The number you hold will likely diminish during the game.  In my last game two of four minions found themselves unable to pass the blame for too long and the game just fizzled.  I am going to have to house rule that.  That gripe aside, I found Aye, Dark Overlord a lot of fun to play.

I used to own the Stratelibri edition of this game, which suffered from a rather small card deck and English rules that valued flavour over clarity.  The FFG edition improves on both.  The Munchkin-esque art that is used in both isn't great, but I suppose it is apt.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1.5
Not my kind of party game. Its a story telling game with one player (the overlord) as a judge to award points to the players.

RATING: 6
Card-driven story telling game about goblins failing the masters mission. The cards are mostly fantasy fiction based, which suggests that choosing initial fantasy-themed missions for the goblins to have failed at might be more appropriate, but not all that necessary. Fast gameplay with zero downtime for players that pop up into each others storytelling sequence introducing twists, screw-you elements and building a crazy story together. The necessity of a moderator is a negative point but a must for the game to work. All-in-all, can be great fun but only with the right group of people.

Just an OK game. For a "narrative" game, it has too many rules to follow, but I don't think anyone would call this a strategy game... so I guess you need to throw the rules and just play more free-form for this game to be worthwhile.

Also, the idea that players should humiliate themselves for the sake of the game while playing as the goblins, like I've heard some people say, really turns me off. I mean, If I have a good excuse, why should I do that? Duh.

A group activity at best. A headache to play. The rules are way too vague/lenient and don't really let you be as creative as possible nor give you structured play.

Would rather play something more open ended (Fiasco, Paranoia, Everyone is John) or more structured.

Combining the game [gameid=1234] with making excuses may seem a stupid idea but in this game it works like a charm. People are just making up excuses using the cards in their hands about why the mission went horribly wrong. The cards make sure that this leads to hilarious situations where it is very hard to switch the blame to somebody else. Get the evil eye three times and you lose. Limit of the cards could hurt the replayability.

RATING: 7
In order to enjoy «Aye, Dark Lord!» you don’t need just a group of close friends: you need them to be keen on roleplaying as well, for everything hangs on the way each one impersonates his own character. So, even though this is a rulelight game, it is advisable to be played by expert gamers only or by those non gamers who are prone to talk a lot and convincingly.

The most difficult role is the Dark Lord’s, for his position allows him to lay down the law: it is obvious that such an unlimited power has to be used sparingly, to prevent the game from degenerating into a constant quarrel. Being impartial and deeming his players/minions by what they’re saying (not by what he thinks of them) is mandatory: at the same time, every player is requested a strong dose of humour and self-irony, which explains why you need a good group of roleplayers or experienced gamers.

The expansion adds new cards and substantially does what it says: it expands the basic game.
It is a nice addition though.

A storytelling game. It didn't work for us; probably works well with the right group. The rules distract a bit from the game though. I would rather play this freeform, with players drawing cards whenever they need an inspiration. And it would be better with more cards, since after one or two games, you have seen them all.

Based on 1 play with 4 players: Okay the premise for this game is absolutely adorable and VERY funny. That said, I still have the same problem with this game that I do with most other storytelling games: it's too easy to get stuck with a bad hand. Getting stuck with crappy cards is frustrating, and hearing other people try to use cards that clearly don't fit the story takes away from the fun of storytelling. 

Winners and losers feel particularly arbitrary in this game, as you're simply up to the mercy of the Overlord. Could see the humor getting stale after you're familiar with all the cards, but I guess that just depends on the creativity of your group.

Seems like it has potential, but still rather bland with only 4 players.  I think more people will definitely improve the experience.

Played again with five players, but different players.  Tons of fun this time.  Although we had five players instead of four, I think it helped more to have a set of players with good synergy.  Also, several players had RPG experience, which aided in improvising story elements.

This is a group game where you need people who can spin a story. If you have anybody who can't spin a story, the game can get boring.

One player is the Dark Overlord, his dark plans have been foiled and he's looking for someone to blame.

Only played once. I enjoyed the experience, but it's not really a game. It's more like competitive improvisation with the cards acting like a rough script. I'd like to try this one again to get a better feel, but it may not get to the table much since Avalon gives a somewhat similar experience (IMO) with slightly less effort needed from the players. But, if you enjoy acting, this one is a must have. It is probably used as course work at Juilliard.

Funny storytelling card game.  Basically, it's Apples to Apples for roleplayers.  I'd love to rate it higher, but the small number of cards limits the replay value.

Party Game capolavoro. Ero presente alla prima presentazione e poi a molte delle giocate successive in Con.
Ottimo per fare chillout tranne forse per chi ha problemi di gola. Ottimo per far giocare anche ragazzini o giocatori occasionali.
L'edizione commerciale si prende una tirata d'orecchi perchè è stata un po' troppo sfruttata commercialmente specie per le edizioni limitate con meno carte occhiataccia. I Disegni di Crosa sono belli ma mi spiace un po' che siano spariti quelli di Chiara.
Sarebbe interessante se ora Zib e LordMax sviluppassero Si Oscuro Editore... ^_^

It’s very much comparable to Once upon a time in theme and execution. This time you have to make excuses why you failed your mission. This is an experience game and should be played with the right group of people who likes to make up stories. Personally, I prefer this to Once upon a time because it is more structured and there are more coherent stories made with it.

You need a good group of players to get the most from this fun game. Very much full of roleplaying and absolutely amazing stories. Should have recorded some of my sessions, lovely game.

Great great fun, but do research on how to be an overlord first. The game needs a strong overlord who knows when to be lenient so players who aren't as good don't dislike the game, when to be petty so players know to appease you at all costs, and knows how to ham up the evil roleplaying.

There's a Lexus commercial that keeps playing on Pandora.  It claims that the alternative fuel debate is over and that the new Lexus ride can use any alternative feul either now or in the future...does this sound like BS to anyone else?  When I hear that something can be anything I want I just have a little alarm that goes off...So if I tell you that overlord can be whatever you want, that the game morphs to the players personality you'd think I'm lying right.  People have forgotten what RPG is, what makes a good time.  I havn't played Toon in 10 years and maybe, dare I say it, had forgotten why I game until I busted this little gem out...so find yourself a 10 year old that already knows how to lie and a waitress and your cheap lying self and your mom, we all know what a liar she is...and start making excuses.  -H7
-Update- I was just informed by the local crazy that Zulus are coming out of the swamps to kill us all...he looked me dead in the eye and asked me 'well what are you going to do about it mr. president?'  Thanks to this game I could cooly explain why none of it was my fault.  Are you playing Aye dark overlord?  Could you have calmed this victim of society with a monolouge of reassuarances like I did?   -H7

I do like this game (don't let my rating fool you), but it's hard to play a game when one player in the group HATES the game.  & I love the person in our group who hates the game--I can't fault her for it & it's her right to hate it (we can't love every game the group wants to play).  I just find myself sympathizing with her plight, to play the game to appease the group, & it distracts me from coming up with good--funny--excuses for the Overlord as to why our mission failed.  I think it's a game which is very fun &, often, hilarious!  It's a good RPG disgused as a card game & would be awesome when every player at the table embraces it for what it is.  I applaud the game's designer for an excellent concept.  Best played with RPGers, Improv Actors & goofs who are willing to dig deep & not be afraid to perform.  This is what makes the game sessions shine.

Don't own but tried it out with my Dixit cards. 
We had a blast. This will probably become one of my favourite games to introduce people into role-playing.

Voldemort: "Ah, my beloved Nagini. I sent you on a mission to locate where she is. Why is it that you have not found her yet, Kai?"

Me: "My lord. I found her but then she shape-shifted and disappeared before my very own eyes"

Voldemort: "Nagini is a snake. She cannot shapeshift."

Me: "Ohhh... Frick... x.x"

That was the quickest round to end. Dammit.

Aye, Dark Overlord is one of those silly, goofy party games that are great if the only think you are looking for is behaving stupidly and burst in laughs. 

The premise is as follows: one player is Rigor Mortis, the almighty powerful Dark Overlord, while the rest of the players incarnate one of his stupid and not very reliable minions. And, as always happens, the minions have failed in accomplishing the evil guy's orders (which can go from doing the laundry to conquering the world, your imagination puts the limit); obviously, Rigor Mortis is a bit pissed, so he is going to punish someone... And you must make sure that it is one  of your "pals", so that you can continue living your pitiful life.

Yes, that's the game. Not more, not less. You have to make up a story, based on the cards you have in your hand. And this is where the laughs start: obviously, most of the time your cards will have little or nothing to do with what's going on, so you have to sound as confident as you can while making up the story. The game is only fun when you are trying your best to get your partners killed, though. You must try to lure your pals to constant dead ends and situations that seem can't be avoided. If you leave loose endings they will make their way out one way or another and the game will drag. And drag. And everyone will be bored, so be mean.

The worst part of it is that completely relies on the crowd you are playing: if they don't want to be mean and behave foolishly, it will be utterly boring after five minutes. Also, if players keep recycling ideas it will become boring after two plays, when the creepy castle is use for the same lame excuse once again.

Each player is an evil goblin servant of the evil Dark Overlord (Rigor Mortis, the Master of all Evils), and all of them are gathered at the Dark Overlord's knees to explain why they brought that last important mission, ordered by 'His evil Excellence' himself, to failure again. Panic wraps you in its freezing grip, what can you do to save your poor skin? Could you say you are not the one to blame, but your inept companions?

Yes of course, that's the solution! There is only one little problem: they've probably got exactly the same idea... and the Dark Overlord is not known for his mercy...

This roleplaying game is all about telling lies and shifting the blame on your poor fellow ones, so the righteous Wrath of your Master can give them what they deserve!

If you like the idea of "Once upon a time" but wish it had a little more structure, ADO is for you. The presence of a game master as well as the context - underlings trying to shift the blame for having failed their dark overlord's mission - makes it a lot easier to keep the ball rolling. With the right crowd (a little background in fantasy RPG doesn't hurt), it's simply hilarious!

The card art and the little snatches of narrative and character development on the HINT cards are lively and funny, and one could imagine them being used to add color to some cleverly designed RPG or storytelling game along similar lines to (say) TALL TALES, DARK CULTS or PANTHEON. Unfortunately AYE, DARK OVERLORD itself is not such a game - the rules have a sketchy, carelessly-thought-out feel to them, causing the experience of gameplay to hover uncomfortably between total freeform and the disconcerting sense that one should actually be trying to win.

Intrinsic in its simplicity, this small card game can offer
volumes of laughter and a few watery eyes. Here there is no
quest to be done... no treasures to be won.. no princesses adbucted and no castles conquered..and all the while all the other dark overlords get to enjoy these simple pleasures of life, you don't! And why? but because your minions are worthless imbeciles!!! These inbred halfwits can't get to complete but the simplest of tasks..For once more you have to listen to their incessant blathering... One player takes the role of the psycologically strained overlord while the rest players take the role of the grovelling thick-headed minions who try to excuse their incompetence...

RATING: 7.5
A really fun card-driven story-telling game where one player has the opportunity to lord over everyone else, while everyone else gets to grovel unashamedly.
Having to base your story off of cards in your hand can be limiting for some people with a rather active imagination or good improv skills, but it usually tends to make it easier for people who aren't as inclined towards improvisation and roleplay and makes this game a lot more open to different player types.

RATING: 8
Card-driven story telling game with a strong theme and a setting and mechanics that gentle shepards the players rather than overtly restricts them. Where [i]Once Upon a Time[/i] is a deep excercise in fairy tale story telling, [i]Aye, Dark Overlord![/i] is more akin to beginners' impro with an easily internalisable setting provided. 

Thus, less free than f.i. [i]Once Upon a Time[/i], but much freer and with more replatability than [i]Gloom[/i]. Mechanics and theme interacts well, and the combination of some hand management with a strong storytelling focus and well-defined pass-the-blame core game mechanics exellently ties together the theme and game execution. Relatively short session times, and very low down times where usually even the waiting time is engrossing and enjoyable, yhe game's main drawback is, similarly with Gloom, the dearth of cards. With no expansions this reduces intra-session replayability, but also promises great fun when after a rest period it gets of the shelf again. 

It is a challenging and creative, yet fun and easy-going experience for both overlord and plaeyrs both, but while it can be played by less creative people it will be most enjoyed by creative and imaginative players, and will likewise greatly benefit from an imaginative and reciprocal overlord.

A mix of a storytelling rpg and a party game. It can be very fun but the rules and cards are only there to get ideas and if players are imaginative they might not even need them.

Very fun game, as long as your friends don't mind a bit of light roleplay. If they're too serious, they're not going to be any fun. My other half adores this game. There are a couple of issues with the rules (if you don't have any action cards you automatically take a withering look, doesn't make sense) that need to be adjusted with house rules, but once they're cleared up it's a blast.

Not a bad game certainly, it's pretty barebones and the game lives or dies on the roleplaying of its players. If everyone plays loose and silly, the game works. If people worry about how to win or succeed, not so much. It's not a bad game, it's just not a natural fit for me.

Birthday gift 2011. This one looks more like an rpg than a card game, and I am actually thrilled by that, but I think it will greatly narrow the pool of people I can play it with. Looking forward to giving it a try.

Game was great fun with the gaming club kids, who were really willing to get into the spirit of it, use silly voices and accents, snivel, grovel, simper, and tremble. I am not sure how the game would go with adults--they seem to take themselves too seriously for a game like this. As such, I think it only gets a 7, at least until I can try it out with a bigger group.

Parti játék magas fokon! Csak barátokkal szabad játszani!!! Meg sem próbáltam családdal.. Hazudni kell, pocskondiázni és képtelenebbnél képtelenebb történeteket kitalálni. Sok múlik a Sötét Nagyúr személyén, mert gyakorlatilag ő szövi a történetet, tesz fel megfelelő keresztkérdéseket. Javarészt engem kérnek fel Nagyúrnak, de így is nagyon élvezem a játékot, hiszen a lényeg a nevetés, és a jó szórakozás mindenkinek, még a szemlélőnek is garantált.
Szerintem 4 főnél többen nem érdemes játszani. 1 Nagyúr és 3 szolga elég, más esetben lehet valaki nem jut annyi szerephez.

The quest to appease the Dark Overlord, Rigor Mortus, has gone awry and he’s looking for answers... and you better have them! Using story cards for inspiration, you, as a minion in the Dark Overlord’s service, have to come up with a convincing, plausible, and satisfactory excuse as to why the Dark Overlord should spare your life given your costly mistake(s), ‘Passing the Buck’ to another minion who will hopefully bare the brunt of the master’s ‘Withering Looks’ and earn you another day of honorable service.

RATING: 7.3
like Once upon a time, Aye Dark Overlord, Are you the Traitor/Werewolf, the Resistance or any similar game, these are perhaps my favorite genre of game. They REQUIRE the right group. Right group is a euphemism for people who actually have some inkling of roleplaying, charisma, fun, wit, humor, exuberance, and amicability than this game wins wins wins. Which also means that if your group doesn't like these games, it might be time to get new friends rather than a new group because it's literally their fault and not the brilliant game.

Brilliant game that involves backstabbing, pure roleplay fun, a de emphasis on who wins, is fast energetic jam packed in low amount of time, variable ways and criteria to play as victory conditions, involves acting, quick thinking, improv and improvising, wit, clever banter, a sense of irony and humor and story telling. This is a brilliant game that requires actually clever fun interesting people not introverted self-impressed competative assholes concerned with triple checking the rules to see how best they can use their cards in order to win rather than realizing that the cards are the guides and tools for fostering an extremely, fun, light, yet intense, fast-paced, creative experience.

To me, doesn't have the kind of replay ability that a Werewolf style game has or Once Upon a time but that only means you take it out for less time, making it a great warm-up, cool-down, and filler game without having to resort to something that's overly boring and low energy like most fillter games are.

A great way to have filler that involves roleplay, acting, improv, humor, wit, and quick thinking in a relaxed, doesn't matter who loses atmosphere.

Simultaneously for what it is and what it seeks out to do both successful and original respectively, I give this remarkable game an 8.8

UPDATE: still a great game but when compared to Once Upon a Time it does not hold the same replay value. It also relies a lot on the moderation and quality of the Overlord which Once Upon a time doesnt require. A good game still though.

Depends on a good narrator, else the game is bad. With a role player group and a good narrator/dark lord you can have brilliant moments with it!

a party game! Vomit! The silly theme is a the players are mostly playing bumbling servants/henchman that are trying to give excuses to the Overload player why the screwed up the overloads plan.  sound like the them of the television show "The Aprectice", the "Office" or an average day at work.  The game choice mechanisms is to play actions cards to link to story cards together  to "explain away" a story and make excuses to the overload.  Then there is on and on bickering and counter argument.  Weak game mechanics is the hallmark of this game.

I rate this game really highly, but that's because my game group is composed of exactly the type of person who plays this game well - roleplayers and those without any sense of dignity. It's tremendous fun if people get into it; so far every game I've played I've been sore from laughing, wanted to play again immediately afterwards, and then reminisced on it for the rest of the day. Not for everyone (it's barely a "game" after all), but you're the improv or roleplaying type, you'll love it.

This game is basically a framework for improvisational comedy, so it's really only as good as the people playing it. The Dark Overlord is, in a sense, the referee that keeps the improvisation moving and holds people to their roles. By chiding and threatening the minions, and by randomly introducing capricious rules and out-of-nowhere story elements, the DO helps create the atmosphere.

If you're quick on your feet, funny, imaginative and good at staying in character, this is a great game for you. Theater students, actors and similar types will find much use for this exercise in improvisation.

This game is great! I've never actually played it by the full rules, but whenever we've played, it's been the highlight of the night.

Roleplaying and storytelling game. Funnier than Once Upon A Time, and as good as Baron Munschausen. Yes, you do need the right players (fast-thinking roleplayers). The game might not hit the table all that often, if only because you'll want to rest a bit between all that improv!

I don't particularly recommend this to most Eurogamers  "game = dry mathy strategy" players. But if you've played RPGs (and not hide behind a character sheet) or can do improv, it's a fun game, assuming such things are possible.

The game neatly encourages story telling. The following may sound strange, but because the game forces you to spin stories about the craziest events, the conversations appear less forced (when compared to serious story telling games for example). The game really relies on its players, so play it with boring/austere people and it will suck. It isn't much of a surprise that this game is loved by Italians or French and is hated by my fellow Germans (fortunately not including my friends).

It's crazy how much fun it can be w a bunch of highly imaginative peopl! I rated this a 6.5 simply for the experience i had playing this.

The only thing that gave this game such a high mark, was the overlord that we had. He gave us glares for whatever reason, which made giving our stories an added challenge.

It could remind Once Upon a Time but its mechanic drive game to chaotic situation where players try to point the failure cause of the mission beetween eachothers trying to avoid the Dark Masters's overlook.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18723/aye-dark-overlord]Aye, Dark Overlord![/url] is a storytelling game (in the likes of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1234/once-upon-a-time]Once Upon a Time[/url]) where you use cards to lead the path of the excuse - because this is what you are doing: giving excuses for your failures in complete the missions given by the Dark Overlord. The cards contain three elements: the name of it, an image and a short text - any or all of them can be used in your excuses. There are other cards: the ones with hands, that are used to pass the guilt of the failure to other goblins (players) or to interrupt their stories, be to throw then even further under the cart, or just to shake his/her storie, so that he/she loses his momentum.

It is different in the sense that the game has no winner: one player will lose (the one that end up with the guilt, in the vacant eyes of the Dark Overlod, three times) the others "win". So, the win/lose is decided by another player, representing the Dark Overlord. The one that loses is, if the players want to play again, the Dark Overlord the next time.

I liked it just fine - it is hard for this sort of game sour the night, because it relies on the group, and the ones I play with are a merry bunch.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18723/aye-dark-overlord]Aye, Dark Overlord![/url] has advanced rules, which weren't used.

After one play, it seems fun but chaotic. Not a girlfriend game at least for me (the whole master/servant thing is weird with other people), so I want to give it a go with people who may appreciate its, uh... quirkiness more :)

A few more plays-- great idea, but implementation falls flat. I think while Once Upon a Time's gameplay helps people tell a story (albeit a strange and weird one), this one has the gameplay mechanics get in the way of telling it, which is a big no-no.

Ευχάριστω παιχνίδι story telling για μια παρέα με φαντασία.
Αν παιχτεί σωστά βγάζει απίστευτο γέλιο.
Μεγάλο ρόλο παίζει ο Overlord που είναι ο game master και πρέπει να το ''έχει'' που λένε.
Για 4-6 παίχτες.(όχι απαρέτητα για εμένα καθώς το έχω παίξει και με περισότερους)
Λίγο ακριβό καθώς είναι μόνο κάρτες.

Falls into the same category as [i]Aunt Millie's Millions[/i]: Yarn-spinning and finger-pointing for adult/kid or kid/kid groups that invariably inspires laughter.  Though [i]Millions[/i] is different in that it layers an actual game onto the proceedings.

Would not be fun (for me) in my regular gaming group, as all-adult storytelling and roleplaying isn't my thing. 

Unless the roleplaying involves a jiggling 'nurse' who stands too close to the stabbing victim in the emergency room and has to swap her blood-sprayed clothing for something more comfortable (i.e., more sheer), which goes without saying.

Based on the one play that I had with this game, it seems this game is trying too hard to actually be 'a game' by throwing in some arbitrary gameplay rules while it's basically a simple roleplaying exercise. 
Its enjoyment is extremely dependent on its players, especially the overlord (who was in our game way too lenient, thereby unnecesserily dragging out the game). 
The gameplay aspect, just like in Once Upon A Time, doesn't really work out here. Playing 'Hold It!' cards with a hint card just to annoy your fellow players , for example, would be interesting if it weren't in this grey area of competition: on one hand, it is fun and thematic to interrupt a fellow player, but by the game's rules it would be very disadvantageous since you don't draw new hint cards unless you get a withered look. 
So we threw out some of the rules as described in the manual to make it our own game and had way more fun with that. I am willing to play again, although it won't get out often because of the specific subset of people it needs.

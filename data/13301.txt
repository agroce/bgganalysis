I like most blind-bidding games. This is one of them, but my problem is the rest of my gaming group doesn't like the blind-bid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, lightish game that often has a sting in its tail.  The blind-bidding is actually short and sweet and this time the game may not hinge on it as mayhem may braek out before you get to move the boat you won a bid on.

When there is a lot of treasure up for grabs in a small area, there is often a premium in winning the ships that are first alphabetically in that area. This enables you to take the first action and potentially whisk the treasure off somewhere that you want it (preferably one of your safe-havens). Clever tricks of passing in a relay fashion can be attained if you have a little luck to go with your planning. You can also use ships to block others - certain sea spaces are very useful in this respect. It's also important to keep track of which towns have already had there treasure placed on the board, whilst the -1 chip is a super and entertaining mechanism!

RATING: 8
A great bidding game where players bid for control of the pirate ships. Quite a lot of mental effort is involved to try to predict your opponents moves, and this is more complicated with 3 or 4 players. A good buy, particularly if you want a pirate theme game with some tactics.

RATING: 7
Very well themed game, and good looking to boot! Play it for fun, as there's not a great deal of depth to it. The game is too short, however, for what strategic depth there is, though; I would like more time to make nefarious plans. Mechanically, there are some odd similarities to Winner's Circle.

RATING: 5
For some reason, I really didn't like this game. My opinion might change with another play, but it would be hard to convince me to play this again (unless my regular gaming partners wanted to play, of course. Almost any gaming is better than no gaming, and this isn't a crappy enough game to drive me from the gaming table.)

A pleasantly surprising game of bluff and timing. Gets a little chaotic with more players, but with 3 it sails (arrrrr...matey) along as you try and outwit the other players by getting into their swashbuckling minds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
{1 play, 4 players} An okay game of second-guessing.  I like that you lock in all 7 of your choices up front each round, rather than doing them one-at-a-time throughout, as this keeps the game light.  Which is good, since it's really not "complex" enough to support much weight.  But, at the same time, it's so short that it doesn't take more than a couple of bad guesses to kind of sink your game.  I had fun learning it, but ultimately it suffers from being one of seemingly thousands of titles that come out now each year, and while it's a perfectly fine game (with very cool 3D cardboard ships), there's really nothing at all special about it.

Components are neat and the bluffing mechanism is actually more subtle than it first appears. seems to end pretty quickly with the rules as written, and my nieces (aged 9 and 11) immediately clamoured for a house rule to play on till the last chest of treasure on the map was accounted for.

Cute and mostly harmless. The partial simultaneous play keeps the game going fairly fast. Unfortunately, the nature of the bidding means you can at most control 2 useful boats. At times you can even get totally screwed and control no boats. Good for kids and possibly as a family game but won't satisfy a hardened gamer by any stretch of the imagination.

Caribic has a beautiful design, but the game is a bit luckdriven. It isn't a typical amusement game either, so it's a bit too light for a strategic looking game.

Game relies heavily on hidden bidding.  Poker strategy plays high as you try and figure out what your opponents want.  Will you fight for the popular choice or attempt to snatch up an easier target? (Or is that what your opponent is thinking too?)

After 1 play, I like this filler. There is a nice bluffing mechanic (which I enjoy), as well as a lot of second guessing which ship your opponents are going to move. One thing though, make sure you Super (or in my case, Gorilla) Glue the ships and the card stands. They will just fall apart if you don't. Raised my rating with a second play with 2 players. Caribbean actually works very well with 2! The whole revealing your tie-breaker tile is more tension filled with 2 and the game came right down to the wire (with me losing), I like this with 2!

For the length, a decent game with some interesting manipulations available.

Not spectacular, not horrible.  The blind bidding could get in one's way at some points, where the tie-breakers aren't well determined.

One must make a good plan for what will be popular and what will not.  Some colors have an inherent advantage as far as the distribution of treasure is concerned in the opening deal.

After a couple plays... Light bidding game of picking up and delivering treasures to one of your pirate lairs. A bit of bluffing as you try to point out particular prizes to others and encourage them to block attempts to pick up and deliver. I think Die Hanse needed a mechanism like this to make that game work, but its hard to say. This one is a great intro to bidding games as you can easily fit a couple plays into an hour's time. Attractive production and clever pirate ship pieces, too.

Good game of bluff, manoeuvre, second guessing your opponents and manipulation. I like that there are so many possibilities on your turn, and that even if something goes wrong early in a round, it doesn't necessarily mean all is lost. With two players, the game can be a real brain burner and tight right to the end. In some ways, it feels a bit like Diplomacy might if there were no conferences or player elimination. I also like the style of the board.

Blech!  Nothing but blind bidding, but the bidding is silly since everyone is trying to do the same thing.  I don't mind blind bidding in games like O Zoo le Mio, where different tile are worth different amounts to different people, but in Caribbean, everyone always wants the same boats for the same reason!  There are way too many safe havens, and the safe havens for each player are so close to each other that a boat can usually reach anyone's safe haven in a given turn.  What a crappy game!

I'd been wanting to try this one for a while. I know Bruno Faidutti is very high on this game.

The actual play was... eh. Not bad. Something didn't click for me. I like the idea of chaining moves with the pirate ships, but the bidding for ship movement was not as interesting as I had hoped.

I'd try it again, but I'm not seeking it out.

The theme fits quite nicely for this as well.

Awesome short game. Fabulous theme and components. I mean c'mon, upright pirate ships that actually carry their treasure! Make sure you get back to your safe haven before some other ship comes along and steals it! Rating reduced slightly after further plays.

RATING: 4
This is a game which just misses the mark. I generally like blind bidding games, especially if the blind bidding is done 'right' meaning it is sufficiently simple to allow the reverse psychology to have some chance of succeeding. Carribean fulfills this criterion by restricting the bidding power, and adding a wonderfully fiendish mechanism to move player-shared boats around based on the winning bid. So far so good. But where the game gets it wrong, dagnabbit, is that bid collision is far too frequent, noticably restricting the opportunities for actually planning something, and yielding less than satisfying game situations. There really should have been more rum barrel-tiles to chose from. And not even many: one, at most two. This would have inserted just the right amount of fluidity in the numbers game to make Carribean a worthwhile addition to my small collection of blind bidding games. In its current shape... No. A shame, really: the game itself has been crafted and produced with care, and it's saddening to see it fail in the way it does.

It feels a little bit like chess in the planning of moves based on what you think the other guy might do.

Traded game for Trias.

Blind bidding with a smattering of doublethink. While the game certainly works on a mechanical level, the resulting gameplay is simply not that engaging, or dare I say, dull? Production is fine, the cardboard pirate-ships are cute and functional, the plastic coins are kinda bland but only needed to track scores. Best with a full complement of four players, but even then it is far from great.

Components: Attractive board with vivid colors and creative divisions of the sea segments. The ships look cool once assembled, but their height often obscures a water boundary, and it's difficult to see what cargo they are carrying.

Experience: Chaos on the high seas! There are some interesting decisions about where to invest my power, but at times there is only one or two ships of use to a particular player, but are also of use to another player, and each is faced with the task of either going all-out for a ship (and most likely canceling each other out) or backing off and letting the opponent have it. Not my kind of outguessing: the game is a bit too long to comfortably support the uncontrollability of Raj, yet too predictable to be truly exciting.

Lord help me, it was the cool plastic coins that pushed me off the fence and into buying this one.  It's growing on me.  This is a game where you need to break out of groupthink to prosper, and the wackier your move, the better you'll do.  I love that.  I don't agree with the assertion that this game is 'chaotic'.  You can plan your moves so that you'll most likely get to execute them, but it will require you to devise a non-obvious course of action.  Plays fast too.  This game also looks great on the table.  I've been playing games with my colleagues at lunch in the cafeteria for some time, but no one ever came up and asked us what we were doing until we played this.

Plays very well with two or three (haven't tried with four yet).  The strategies are very different with more players (a good thing!).  It's like poker in that you're trying to get into the mind of your opponent and determine what they're doing.  A good poker face and the ability to sniff out a bluff are very helpful.  All around fun game!

Played 5+ times. This game is not at all hard to learn and is a lot of fun to play. It's on the much lighter side, and yet there is a fair amount of room for tactics too. The first part of a phase is sort of a blind-bidding to control ships, the but the movement of ships allows for trickiness galore. Beautiful graphics and "assemblable" pirate ships. Great game for 2 players, haven't played with more than 2 yet.

My rating: 6

This is a light filler game of conflict and interaction--everyone is trying to bribe the pirates with rum to deliver treasure to them. Every action (hidden bets) rests on who wins the bribe. 

Plays 2-4 players. My first game was with two, and it was okay, but I know this head-on, conflict game will be so much more fun with 3 or 4. (If you like more control over your planning, stick with 2.)   With two players also found it a little repetitious near the end--with more players hopefully there will be greater uncertainty for who might win so the end won't seem as though it is dragging out. 

Because the pirate ships move in alphabetical order, there can be quite a bit of strategy to the bidding, which takes some thought and can slow the game down.

Although the ships and the card holders are cardboard, I am impressed with their design. I glued the pieces together, and they still fit safely in the box with the board on top of the insert.  

I always appreciate games that have geography, as this one does.  Refreshes my knowledge of the islands and ports.  Visually appealing too.

On Bruno Faidutti's Best List.

Conclusion: Looking forward to playing again with 3-4, and the rating might go up some.

I generally like simultaneous movement/action games so right away I had a favorable response to this one.  I was surprised by the number of opportunities for second-guessing and foiling opponent's plans by moving an earlier both to cause trouble.  Be careful not to count to much on the later boats as they will find a very different set of options by the time it's their turn.  The one problem I noticed is that the colors appear to be matched to interfere one another in pairs (yellow vs blue, red vs green).  In fact in our game, it happened several times that it was always the same players competing for the same one or two boats.  I guess the draw of treasures should force some variation, but I'll have to try it again to confirm my impressions.

A pirate game of blind bidding and double-guessing.

Players bid for the right to move any of the six pirate galleons in order to dig up treasures and bring them home. The highest bidder for each ship may move it, but tied bids cancel each other.

Simultaneous action selection, when it is the sole game element is simply too chaotic and silly.  I hate it.

It took me about a turn and a half of Caribbean to remember why exactly I totally despise games that rely entirely on blind bidding.  There isn't even much psychology or tactics in deciding what to choose since all the boats are worth essentially the same to everyone else.  What a dumb idea.  So naturally it breaks down into randomness and luck of course.  The bits were cute, but blech! I'd rather be drinking the rum instead...

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2017)

I generally don´t like pirate themes so my desire to play Caribbean was very low. Still, it appeared on my Excel cue so I had to play it next. I can say, it is better than expected but it is still not a game for me.

The rules can be explained under 4 minutes, they are very simple. Playtime is less than 60 minutes.

The game´s components are ok, but I suspect they were very good for a 2004 game. The doubloon tokes fall easily from the ships but this is a minor issue. The art is ok.

Caribbean is a family level game. The idea of the game is to manipulate the pirates with rum barrels and made them bring the doubloons to your ports. It is a very simple game but the fun is trying to anticipate your opponents so you can move the trasure where you need it. Also, there is no luck in the game (a huge plus for me), in each turn you plan your moves with all the possibilities at hand.

Gameplay is reminiscent of Black Fleet, but it is a much better game.

Bottom line, Caribbean is a good family game and perfect to introduce new gamers to our hobby., However, it is too light for my current tastes. I already sold it but I was surprised by it because I wasn’t expecting anything good from it. I could play again if requested, but I don’t have a high desire to do so. Caribbean has more depth than I initially thought.

Current Rating: 5.0

RATING: 8
Played once so far, 2P. Nice! Do things like:
- Ignore the "most valuable" ship and thus get to move most of the other ships, to a greater total value
- Tag team your way... move a "useless" ship that can't get where anyone wants but can just get to a pick up, move a later "useless" ship past it collecting the treasure and stopping next to a ship that's still sitting in your own safe haven. (I made a $9000 grab-and-drop this way.)
- Leave an otherwise "useless" ship blocking your opponent's path, making it too far for them to get to a safe haven

With so many options in the board tactical play, this is so much more than "just blind bidding".

Fun quick game. It plays well at all numbers, with the usual addition of chaos with more players. The mechanics are very simple the hard part of the game is figuring out what others are going to do and how you can eek out enough money to defeat them. Great filler as long as people don't over think things.

Within our group this game just does not work. 1 four player game did not allow any long term strategy and often out of the six ships only two were strongly contested (saving the 4 for the decider). While if one player was soon to prosper at least 2 of the other 3 would throw in their minus-1 cards to scupper their plans.  There is the suspicion that there is a good game hidden somewhere but someone needs to spend some time uncovering it.  With 2005 being the year of the pirates games it might be easier to just move onto a better game.

On earlier plays with 2 and 3 players I was told that the main question everyone asked was why?  At present without a go at the 2 player version I am extremely underwhelmed.

This fits in a set of games that is interesting enough for a quick play (our lunch group when we have 3 or 4) but will not see a lot of repeat play.  Once in a while is enough.  The random pull of treasures keeps things from being predictable and the bluff and counter-bluff of bidding on the best ships is the core of the game.  Pulling off an unexpected move that upsets an opponent's plan is the best.  This is a quick-moving game (don't let them take too long on their bids) that does not outstay its welcome.  Neat little game.

Initial rating after 2 games. Quick & nice looking auction game with pirates. Ok filler in a "I think he'll think that I want to do this" way. 

Will probably introduce houserules to lower the amount of money needed to win the game to make it just a hair more exciting. Plays ok with 2, probably not so good (too chaotic) with 4.

NL: vlot en relatief eenvoudig spelletje waarbij je goed moet bedenken wat je tegenstander(s) van plan zijn. Aardig tussendoortje.

RATING: 7
Fun, fast, and with more strategic options than many think. Bidding is blind, but if your paying attention you can bluff and pull off some interesting wins. While it is probably a filler, it has enough going for it to make it on the table a few times in a row. Ships are cool, but may need to be glued to keep them together. Not difficult to do and worth the effort.

Not bad, but did not grab me.  I won easily just collecting one fare a turn with a '5' and a '4' hidden, and won handily.  It looks like this is a viable strategy, and that is not such a good thing.  The boats are cute, and it played very quickly.

There is almost a great game in here; lots of potential for clever combinations of ship movements, but the bidding mechanism really spoils it; you can't (reliably) control enough ships to do anything clever.  Someone needs to steal the basic mechanics, and make this into a good game!

Not too bad for a filler, but there are some issues based on my first play.  A very close end game can severely limit the leading player's tatic with the bluffing element completely breaking down.  The game is so unimpressive that I had almost forgotten I played it today.

Each players have six tokens, with values of -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Fill six slots on the boats labelled A through F, with one leftover token as the tiebreaker token. Simultaneously reveal values on boat A, B, etc. Whoever has the highest value on the boat can move the boat, to pick up ducats and deliver to their home islands for VPs. If there is a tie, players may choose to use their tiebreaker token. The '-1' token subtracts the boats movement from other players. Game ends when someone accumulates 31 ducats. It's a simple game, but I'm not fond of the blind bidding of tokens.  Only played once.

Meh. I've only played this game once, so maybe there's more to this game than I saw at first.  However, based on that first play I'm not inclined to try it again.  The game basically works, but it seemed really bland and uninteresting to me.  Pirate games live or die on theme, and the theme in this one is weak.

It's chaotic plundering on the seas of caribbean. Ships are controlled via blind auctions and ties resolved via one leftover tile. Could be better with fewer players since with four there were almost always ties to those few ships that were best moves during turn.
(rating based on one game with 4 players where I managed to do nothing at all during game.)

Update (2.4.2009): The game is definitely better with 3 players. Not anywhere near good or anything but better.

A bit of a hidden gem for me, this is a bidding game that really will reward intelligent second-guessing and backstabbing. Excellent with three if you can get the continual 2-vs-1 mojo working and realising the thief cards as the crucial 'second way' to win. Lovely components and a 'feel right' aura to the game are the final sheen.

RATING: 7
Caribbean plays well with between two and four players. I prefer it with two evenly matched players, the only drawback in that scenario being that sometimes you might find your bids stalling (i.e. each bidding the same amount for each of the five ships), at which point the game stalls and you'll either need house rules or to call it a draw (usually when this has happened, one player is leading and it's near the end and we've just called the game). That wouldn't happen with three or four players, but with three or four players the line between strategy and luck begins to blur. It's easy to teach, and tense, but it's possible to suffer from analysis paralysis, making the game last a little bit too long sometimes. I've never finished a game in 30 minutes. It's always been closer to an hour. I've played this game at least 25 times, and the only reason I don't own it anymore is because I gave it to friends as a gift (left behind after a trip). I plan to purchase another copy when I see one under 20 bucks. Nice components and board too, but if I'm being honest then maybe seven points as a rating is a tad too high. But I'm biased because this is the game that turned me onto board games and because I lived in the Caribbean when I started playing it.

Another one of these 45 minute games with a bit luck, a bit chaos, and alot of fun.  You do this kinda blind-bidding (and I usually hate blind bidding) to move around pirate ships, get treasure or steal treasure from another boat, then get it back in your safe haven.  It was a riot, lots of yelling, laughing, and cursing - my kinda game.  You have to out guess your opponents, which can be very frustrating at times, but it works very well.  Highly recommended.

After a few plays I think my first impression of this game being a Chess/Adel Verpfichtet hybrid still holds: it has that mind reading aspect of what your fellow pirate(s) will do spatially as well as that "do you see what I see" move that you hope has been overlooked, common in open info abstracts; but it also has that fun missing in such bland designs such as the coincidental/situation comedy found in Hoity Toity. I'm unsure if I prefer the more control for manoeuvring in 2 players or the more fun and social competition with 3 (I think ultimately, 4 is chaotically frustrating). I love maps boards and I like the open colour coded status so it is easier to assess if someone is close to the target score.

This is a hidden little gemlet for me.  Part of it is that I really like blind bidding, and bluffing.  If you Don't then avoid this.  Some people think things get to chaotic.

I dig it for some quick easy fun.

I think this game may improve with more players and a couple more games.  It was not the most enjoyable game this first time but I think the strategy was not clear for my opponent.  The game has a nice bidding style.  The bits are kind of nice.Played April 08OK played again:  Thoughts:Too light for real gamers.  Too heavy for non-gamers.  This is a good idea, not great that just is plainly not working that well.  Maybe that is just with my groups, but I just do not see the game working with many.  It would be a decent gambling game.  Better than something like LCR, but players have to feel that they are of the same quality of play.  There is little luck.  Very little.  But the bidding is interesting.  Bits are great I must say.

Good-looking, but didn't quite sit well with me. Secret bidding is entirely in the dark, too random to actually offer a chance for tactics. A simple "house rule" might change this: substitute the Zero tiles for "-2", thus adding some real backstabbing power to the game. Have yet to test this, though.

For some reason I just find this game plain boring, maybe because there are not a lot of things to do.

Fun game, enough there to keep interest, but some quite random outcomes can develop.  Can be a situation where you are caught unable to act because everyone else bid higher than you in turn, which could be frustrating, but it moves quick enough that this shouldn't be too much of a problem.

Since everyone shares the board and is trying to do almost exactly the same thing (your port placements are different but they are close to everything else so it doesn't matter), the blind bidding becomes completely random.  Although the game looks great, the gameplay didn't sit well with me.

Having been a fan and happy player of the old AH Blackbeard, I was looking for a new and distinct pirate game. I liked the look and scope of Caribbean better than other current offerings, but wondered about the idea of players not actually getting to play the pirates themselves. Then it dawned on me - while the game as it is out of box is great, the components also allow for turning the game around to the pirates point of view ...

This blind bidding game stands out a bit, since you are bidding not just for ownership or control of something (in this case pirate ships), but for its degree of movement, too. However, I've found it to be a bit tedious and lasting more than I'm willing to invest, so I haven't played it much.

Yay!  This game is a ton of fun.  I'm not sure how deep or strategic it is, but it does a great job of keeping me entertained.  I like the movement system and the ways to manipulate the numbers.  I'm a sucker for group think games and this one pulls it off well.  Great theming and fine pieces make this a joy to play.  Frankly, I'm sick of blind bidding games, and if it weren't for the theme, I'd have regrettedly skipped this.  The bidding is fine as it plays so quick and there are only a few people going for a few different boats.  Lots of tough litle decisions.  I'm not so sure how well this would go over with hardcore gamers, but for a light beer and pretzels game, this  keeps my quasi-gamer friends quite engaged.

While I appreciate the blind bidding and some of the strategy, there is just not quite enough going on here to completely captivate my interest.  I think it's because it is fairly obvious which moves to make and there is just not quite enough decision making.

Looks nice and the mechanics sound interesting on paper, but the gameplay doesn't generate enough excitement for me.

Silent bidding game where players bid on the right to control the pirate ships for that round.  There's some nice psychology involved here.  The 3D cardboard pirate ships are very cleverly designed.

The ships are cute (I'm always fond of pieces that can take on a vaguely real-life quality, in this case carrying little treasure chests). Also like games that look like you should own things on the board, but don't.

Even though it is a bluffing game what we found was often a couple of us would be fighting over one ship while the two others bribed their own and were able to walk away with a lot.  I will give it a few more tries but first impression is that I might pull it out as a light filler on occasion... but that is about it.

I usually get screwed in blind-bidding games. For some reason I don't do so bad in this game. The chaos of what people are going to take/move/steal makes it hard to plan turns, but rewarding when what you're betting on turns out to be right.

RATING: 5
This is a simultaneous action selection game that didn't grab me in the least. There are a number of much better games with similar mechanics. The main problem with this one is that its too easy to get way behind if you double pick with someone even once and no real way to catch up since the game is so short. Go play Hoity Toity or Edel Stein and Richt

Caribbean is a bargain for the box size and the price.  The large upright boats actually hold treasure chests!  This is blind-blidding at its best, whereby the bids are part of a more thoughtful game.  One or two lousy bids won't ruin a game and strategic play can trump the bidding in several ways.  The board is straightforward and the rules are a snap to teach.

With four players it's impossible to take others' plans into account and the high scorers seem to be those who can apply the movement points they win tactically to their advantage rather than trying to plan strategically for the whole turn.

Awesome game!  I played it with a few friends and the first game was so good that we played it two more times.  It's all about guessing what others will do and trying to get in there and do it before they do or just foil them.  The conflict this creates is top notch.  For such a simple game you really get into it.

Excellent light game and fun way to fill half an hour.  Haaarrgh! me hearties!

Also good fun chaos as treasures get nicked, moved, nicked again, and never quite end up where you think they're going to!

I'm not much of a fan of blind bidding, but this is over quick enough for me not to get too stressed!

Taught by BeyondMonopoly and others at PrezCon 04.  This is a nice blind bidding game.  It reminds me of Pirates Cove without the stupid combat that penalizes players for guessing 'wrong'.  I am not sure if there is any real strategy to it, yet, but it plays very quickly.  Even if there isn't, a light, fast, pirate themed game would get played anyway.

I love games. I love everything about them. I love the art, the tiny pieces and the narratives. I love the logic of the rules, and the magic that emerges from that logic. I love the "clockwerk effect" which is the only way I can describe how (to me) the many moving parts of the mechanics come together to turn the players into cogs of a wonderful machine, a machine that produces group game-experience. So it always surpirses me when I play a game I don't like. It is as if some naive part of me loves games so much, it finds it incomprehensible that anything game-ish could not have the one true game-nature. So tonight, again, I was surpirsed. Caribbean failed me. It is a game without even a whiff of game magic: Caribebean failed not because it was broken (it isn't), not because it is nonsensical or poorly implemented (it isn't) but instead it failed because it did something even worse: it just isn't fun. Caribbean failed to be interesting or humorous, thought-provoking or tense. It failed to be anything but a chore.

The low rating confounds me (you didn't approve of my 9?)... simple and elegant. The bidding (and bidding mechanism) is fast, furious and FUN! We can't help but giggle with nervous anticipation every time the bidding phase comes around! A family game that gamers can enjoy.

Get it and play it.

Medium weight rating due to the "but if he knows that I know that he knows that I know..." aspect.  Frustrating little game about bribery and chests.  After some initial trepidation I stopped to think  for a bit during play and the game just clicked.  Not long ago I would have said I didn't like this game, but now I do.

(After 1 2p game)  Nice looking map and boats (glued) that caught my wife's eye.  A little disappointed with the game play.  I do like the bidding and bluffing aspect, but the most valuable ship was usually readily apparent.  This might be better with 3 players.  Played with the rule that each action (steal/trade/load/unload) requires you to spend one action point that was suggested here on the Geek.  

Perhaps the order of the ships could be changed by rolling a 6 sided dice before the bidding to make the later ships (E, F) potentially more valuable or useful.

RATING: 7
Fun - a good filler - but not too much tactics to it - its about guessing what you're opponants are goin to do, and beating them to it, or avoiding it, and picking up some easy points elsewhere.  Its frustrating wasting your high bribes and not getting anything for it due to a tie.

The sea is divided into spaces. Each player is in possession of three safe havens, marked in his color on the board.

The aim of each player is to lure the pirates to deliver treasure crates to one of their own safe havens, and not to the safe havens of the opponents.

The pirate ships do not belong to any player. That is why the players must bribe the pirates each time they want a pirate ship to act on their behalf.

In every round the players try anew their best to bribe the pirates. The player who has offered the most rum to a ship gets to move that ship as many spaces as the number of barrels shown on the bribing chip. An active ship can (a) rob a crate from a port or from another ship, (b) reach a crate over to another ship, (c) swap crates with another ship, and/or (d) deliver a crate into a safe haven.

The aim is to have the most doubloons at the end of the game.

Not a real brain burner, but this one stands out just a notch above the solid 7's that came out of Essen last year.  What it lacks in strategy is made up for in fun and talking like a pirate.  I found the quality of the ship components better than I expected.  They're thick cardboard (I thought they would be like the styro stock of Pirates of the Spanish Main)

I was surprised how well this game worked for us, an underrated game IMO. Or is it simply that so many despise blind-bidding?

Played once (with 4 players). A pure blind-bidding game, where you have to make all your bids at once - which means you have even less control on what is going on. The map makes it likely that all players are interested in the same ships during a given turn, decreasing the control you can have even more.

This game is great fun. The components are well done and really add to the piratey-ness of the game. The fact that you can actually carry around your booty  (arrrr!) on the ships is awesome. I've only played this 2 player with my anti-gaming fiancee and even she likes it. It's deeper than you'd think when you try to make the best move for you AND analyze your opponent's most likely wagers at the same time. Great stuff.

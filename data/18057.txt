Good party game for people interested in nature. Best with 4-6 players.

Boring. After the third event has been layed down, the chances of a mistake are so high, it would be crazy not to call out. Finding this pattern, the gameplay is extremely slow....

There are confusing terms on the cards once in a while and lots! of plants. But the game is big fun! Always!!

My favourite Anno Domini set. Interesting events, widely distributed throughout the centuries and millenia. Thumbs up!

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

In this version the years are comparably well spread. Especially the medical cards often have really surprising years and it is more difficult for me to estimate years than in other versions.

Trivia about historical dates is just not my cup of tea. Probably very enjoyable for the right crowds, just not for me.

Anno Domini is one of the very few games my wife also likes to play. So thats the very main reason I own a couple of it. I also think its fun, but the fun begins when you play with at least four players (five or six are even better). You should also make sure that you don't have an "expert" in the round (played the Natur topic two times with a biologist teacher... no fun! ;o) ).

I thought this should be interesting, but it isn't. Not as funny as other versions.

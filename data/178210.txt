Fluxx was one of my "gateway games" and I'm still a big fan. The randomness doesn't bother me and it's a very "go with the flow" low strategy card game. The themes really sell it. The only thing I don't enjoy is how long and drawn out some games can get. +0.5 for Batman theme :) I love the little bat tokens.

Nothing about this version of Fluxx grabbed our attention. While the art is based on Batman : The Animated Series ( a show that I love) , it is an art style that lends itself to animation only. It just doesn't look good as still art. Plus the game play is plodding whereas we usually find Fluxx to be fast paced. Plus there is a meta-card in the game that gets you a benefit if you're wearing a Bat-logo shirt! I hate stuff like that in games. It's why we hate party games. Another miss for Fluxx.

Too much to keep track of, and too few interesting choices.

Learning new rules added mid-game is fine.  Trying to forget a rule when it goes away is hard.

Urgh. This game is such a chore to play, it can be 5 minutes or 45, the skill involved is minimal, yet the complexity is huge. Plus, the chance for AP is through the roof. 

This is exactly what modern gaming shouldn't be.

Since entering the hobby, I would say this is the least fun game I have played. I will avoid at all costs in the future.

I think this version of Fluxx is the best. Because Batman, Batgirl, Robin, Nightwing all help remove the many Creepers (rogues gallery). Other versions usually only have 3 or so creepers and one card to remove them, this has about 9 creepers and 5 to remove them, and it allows for more dynamic gameplay.

RATING: 8
Since *any* Creeper owned by *any* player prevents *anyone* from winning, there is a weird co-op element to this version.  Lots of Keeper abilities, too, akin to Star Fluxx.

I love the theme here, and I think that the mechanics actually kinda sorta play well to the theme. You can put bad guys in prison, and break them out, it's a neat addition to the Fluxx game play. Normally, I'm not a huge fan of the randomness, but because I love batman so much, this one is fun to play if the family wants to break it out.

Fluxx is an interesting game but Batman Fluxx just fell on it's face. The rules are unclear and the game play all round awkward. How they managed to do this to an already established game I have no idea.
The art is nice but unless you plan on using the cards for bookmarks, this game is useless.

A great (and very random) take that game, all versions of Fluxx are. This one did actually surprise in that in includes a unique rule in which no player can win if there are any creepers on the table (except when the goal allows creepers); that's actually a very thematic and fun twist to the game and it really makes this one stand out among the various versions of Fluxx far more than I expected it would. Also, if you order from Looney Labs' website, you can get the two-face flip promo card and coin which is possibly the most awesome promo ever (that coin is gorgeous!).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
So, Batman (The Animated Series) + Batman & Robin style artwork come to the crazy world of Fluxx.  It has the usual keepers and creepers.  No other rule changes apart from working more in with the creepers, or at least I feel.  A good laugh nonetheless.

Lovely artwork, very nostalgia stirring

A decent version of Fluxx that is good for playing with the kids.  The mechanics fit the license pretty well.  As is appropriate with Batman, there are a lot more creepers (villains in this case) than other versions of Fluxx and some interesting ways of dealing with them.

Batman: The Animated Series gets adapted into Fluxx, with the villains as creepers and heroes are keepers. The goals are all combinations based on the series —— and there's enough of them to make sure the game doesn't go on too long. A pretty good adaptation that makes a nice distraction for a half hour or so.

PLUS: easy to learn, adherence to theme
MINUS: it's Fluxx… so it's not a heavy game in any way

I'm on record as preferring Fluxx variants without Creepers over ones that have them, but Batman Fluxx is probably my favorite variant, and it's crammed with 'em.  Part of why I like it is that they do a good job of incorporating the creepers into play so they don't slow down the game too much, but who am I kidding?  The fact is, I'm a huge mark for Batman, and especially the DC Animated Universe interpretation, which is all over this set.  There's basically no way I wasn't going to like this, and the fact that it plays well is just gravy.

Of course, the Bruce Timm DCAU-style art is phenomenal, and really makes the whole thing.  But the theme is well-executed and brings you a fairly balanced game as Fluxx goes, and it lends itself well to what narrative Fluxx possesses, giving it the illusion of depth if not actual depth.  Overall, aside from the original, still my fave.

Fluxx is a nice light card game as far as I'm concerned but definitely need to limit game times. 10 min is the house rule I've read about but maybe 15 or 20 is better while folks aren't familiar with the cards?

RATING: 7
It's Fluxx, if you know what that means and like that and Batman, it's a no brainer. Fluxx set tend to add new things with each new theme. This one mainly adds abilities to the keeper cards. Not nothing, but not a game changer either.

(After 6 Plays) 10/13/16: This game is easy to understand and quick to get playing. There isn't too much strategy as the game is always evolving. It's a fine distraction but can go long at times and just feel mindless. The friends enjoy this one more than I do. Slight lower score then Cartoon Network as it includes Creepers which seem to extend the game.

Same problems as every other Fluxx - plus new problems. Seems nearly impossible to win with hero goals, since villians make it impossible, so the goals that involve instead villians or especially a certain number of villians on the table always seem to win. I like the artwork on this one slightly more, even though it's not consistent.

More of the keepers have special abilities, and anyone's creeper can keep you from winning.  Interesting twists.

Any gamers probably have a couple editions of their favorite pop culture worlds pasted onto Fluxx. And Batman has always been a favorite of mine. The game play is simple (take one card, play one card) to get a winning combination of a specific type of card. Fluxx card games are fast and fun time fillers. It's a great way to get everyone's mind churning for the next Euro or strategy game.

Gameplay didnt enamour me to Fluxx games. Far too much luck involved and even in a 3 player game all planning is easily ruined. Played three times in a row and no one could see any strategy or game play other than hoping an opponent was forced to play a win card that suited your hand. I'd play again only for the theme but sold my copy asap

As a 90's kid I was so excited about this game and it's nod to the 90's cartoon series but in general I just don't think I'm a Fluxx player. A little bit of strategy and a whole lot of luck. Turns can be eternal and a player can just keep playing till they win if they read the cards close enough. I guess I would play it if others really wanted to but overall it's one of my last choices.

As with other Fluxx games, the game is fairly unpredictable and is very luck reliant. I would not play this expecting to match my skills against other card players. However, it's a fine party game, and the many themes mean you can always find a deck that satisfies everyone at the table.

Not for me, but can usually have my arm twisted in a party environment.

Perhaps I should've read a couple of reviews before picking up, yet another themed Fluxx. But after listening to a podcast about the game while it was still a concept, it was implied that creepers were out of this copy. This is not the case at all! The villains are the creepers (but of course they are)! And there is no mention in the rules that the heroes can only win if all villains are off the table!

Even more disappointing, was an oversight on my part. One of my favorite things to do is sleeve my new card game(s). I've stocked up on typical MtG-sized penny sleeves, only to be reminded that Fluxx cards use Dominion-sized cards. Boo.... at least It's still playable. I'll just have to watch out for snackers in my gaming group...

** (I get so rilednup sometimes. Ok, the "new, in-game rules change cards address the cool winning conditions. It still may be fun and fresh. I'll update the rating after a couple of plays of this latest theme.

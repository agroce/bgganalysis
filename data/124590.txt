A so-so game that tends to be a bit on the simpler side, but with too much luck and too long of a play time to mitigate it. I'd play once in a while, but it's not a very good game.

It looks like there are few choices here... I don't know if the variants improve the game but the original feel really flat. The theme also has no sense with game play.

Super light game. Half a minute to explain the rules and you're on your way to playing a decent set collecting card game. 

+1 for the great art.

I didn't like it, neither with 2 or more players. The art is nice, but the theme has nothing to do with the game, so that's not a reason to like it either.

After more plays the game is kind of dull. There are some hard decisions behind the simplicity, but all in all, it's kind of boring. If you got some time to kill its a easy to pick up set collecting game, but be weary it has a little too much luck in the card draw.

rating based on 2 player only (4) 

haven't played enough multi player, but the game seems flawed as just playing out sets of 2 as fast as possible seems to be a viable strategy.

might be better with more players but i'm uncertain if this is much better then war as a 2 player game.

Forcing others to discard their sets when you play a bigger one is a nice twist on set collecting. Very good game.

SOLD IT!

Perfectly reasonable set collecting game that would be better suited in a MUCH smaller box size (ie. Coloretto) instead of the annoying huge tin. The plastic ninjas are cute, but ultimately just added chrome.

Worth playing, just not owning.

The Japanese theme is thinner than 1990s Kate Moss but the art is pretty attractive and adds to the feel of what is basically a set collection card game.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (May 2017)

Michael Schacht´s designs are generally very light and family friendly, in a nutshell, not for me and that´s ok. When I began playing boardgames I really appreciated his games, but I have changed a lot these years. Due to all of this, I wasn’t expecting much from the game.

The rules are pretty simple, you can explain them under 3 minutes. Playtime is also short, around 30 minutes or less.

Like the theme, but it is pasted on. You don’t feel it through the game.

The game´s decisions are obvious and the luck factor is very high. Low in strategy. 

Bottom line, Call to Glory can be a good game to introduce to new gamers to the hobby, but it is way too light for me, obvious decisions. It can work as a filler but these days I almost never play filler games anymore. I can play it again to see if I missed something, but I don´t think the rating will improve with more plays.

RATING: 6
A quick and - at least online at Yucata - slightly addictive card game with an absolutely superfluous theme that's clearly geared towards getting gamers to play this. It's set collection coupled with risk management. Do I play my set now to work towards ending the round and risk that somebody plays a set of the same suit with more cards thereby wiping out my whole set or do I wait and risk that somebody else finishes the round? Not deep but some influence is there. A solid card game. Four rounds FTF can drag but are needed to balance luck.

RATING: 7
A game I had never heard about, not even in passing, until it was put up as the Christmas present game from Yucata.de. It is a game typical of its designer Michael Schacht: simple rules, elegantly done.

At its heart is a set collection game, where you can play down a set of matching cards into the central area, but the trick to it is that there can only be one pile for each set, so if I have a pair of the Emperor card down, you can't play down your Emperors until you have more than me. The card drawing part is interesting too, you draw two cards per turn, but you can choose from either face down draw pile or either face-up discard pile. The game continues until all 9 different card types are in play or until one player has a number based on the number of players. There is a quick game (one round) or the full game (in 4 rounds). Some issues over a lucky run of pairs giving a quick end to a round should be overcome by the multiple round format.

This has already gone too far without mentioning the very evocative and beautiful card art, each a portrait of a Japanese person, done by Drew Baker (who did similarly good work for Ninjato). It plays quickly and smoothly, plus the two variants (Power of the Ninja and Imperial Tasks) add to the tactical considerations. Great light game.

Two-player card game in the same general vicinity as Lost Cities (ie, set collection, worrying about whether your opponent is going to pick up your discards, etc.) Doesn't do much for me, but passable for online.

I've played more times than I've logged.

RATING: 7.5
Fun game with various routes to victory. I wonder how soon i get bored by it because of it's repetitive nature. A whole lot depends on which player is in front of you and if they are collecting the same as you. But you can easily adapt your strategy to that because players will make clear what they are going for by grabbing the cards they are collecting.

A simple card game that doesn't add anything new to the genre. Okay, it's a reimplementation, but again, I'm not sure why. It's fun like many card games (with standard decks!) are fun, but that's not good enough for me.

The theme is pasted on and makes no sense, which makes this game of no interest to me.

Fast paced with a minimal strategic factor that depends 100% on memory: you can be strategic only with a perfect memory. And even there, it only Works well with 2 players, otherwise luck factor dilutes that. And even so, the strategic factor is very simple.

Still, most people ignores I have faced ignores the strategic factor and plays it as a simple luck driven game (thus my win ratio :$)

Basic games seems a bit simple and repetitive with only two players. The two mini variants are mandatory to make this game more fun. More fun with three players as there's more happening.

My six year old can play the base game with the ninja variant. I lost four times! It seems like there's quite a lot of luck involved when drawing cards.

Jogo com uma apresentação excelente, tanto nos componentes (cartas bem ilustradas e aparentemente resistentes), como em embalagem (separador interior a rigor e lata com alto relevo da figura principal), que justificam minimamente o preço alto cobrado, a rondar os €15. O jogo base tem tanto de temático como qualquer outro jogo abstracto disfarçado num tema colado, no entanto, tolera-se sem grande dificuldade. A primeira variante, Tarefas Imperiais, sem interesse por ai além, também nada contextualiza; enquanto a segunda, os ninjas, já confere algum cheirinho ao tema e conhece contornos especiais em jogos a 2. Parece demasiado longo para a complexidade apresentada, especialmente porque, à semelhança das versões anteriores das galinhas e dos automóveis, continuam a ser exigidas quatro rondas para finalizar um jogo. Eu sugeria 2, no máximo 3!

RATING: 6
A very solid set collection game.  I think that the variants will bring a bit more to it but at the moment am enjoying the base game.  I would agree that four rounds plays a bit too long but the three round Imperial Task variant may be just right.

I find it interesting that one player can look to play a rush game if they have a decent initial card draw.  Haven't tried that strategy too often but would be interesting to see how successful it is.  At the moment, it doesn't appear game breaking as card draw will surely affect how quickly you can get six pairs down in a 2p game.

Nice game about getting the biggest set of one type of card, of which only the largest set can be in play and scored at the end of the game.

VPs have a nice inverted relationship with the amount of cards that are in the game. Low VP cards, appear just a few times. The set with the highest value also has most copies in the game and therefore most competition is to be expected for these cards.

The game has very nice Japanese-style 'historical' Shoguny artwork, which is excellent. Although I wonder why some guys want to wear wickerbaskets.

I've come to really appreciate card games of relatively low rules complexity that still require players to carefully deliberate their options each and every move.  Richard James (designer of Lords of Scotland and Court of the Medici) is the current king of that style of game for me, but Michael Schacht would be a not-too-distant second.

Simple set collection, feels like Jaipur for three.
On turn Take face up (discard) or face down card (deck) cards.
Each suit has a score which is also the number of that card. Eg There are 20 cards of no#20.
End of turn discard card, or play a set. You can displace another players set if you have more of the same number, eg you can displace three 10's with four of your 10's

Christmas/New Year's gift from Larry D. This one launched our midday gaming sessions in 2013 :)

Kind of like a rummy game with a few extra draw piles. I liked how you could lay cards and make your opponent discard some and the 4 different draw piles added some strategy for drawing and discarding. Cards were pretty good quality and the art was great. Would love to see it with 3.

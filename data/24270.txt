Three tile placement dictated by boards.  Some giving options.  House rule used to allow re-draw if a cattle drawn and no pen too put it in.  Proposed rule that if you draw a cattle you may choose to place a pen instead.  A little APish for those that were prepared to make the effort.  Nice mechanic limiting card play to number of families you have.  But tactics largely dictated by card draw.  First player disadvantage likely to mean start player passes round each turn by one person.  A lot of effort to try to play for specific cards.  You you can only bank on getting the one you want if you are first player.  Played only 20 tiles each as five players.  No one managed  to play special ability requiring 5 cards.  Would play once more with Anatolia expansion.

The tile-laying and building aspect leaves more strategy than the meeple placement in Carcassonne, which is a good thing. However, the catastrophes tear it all down again and ruin your strategies too much to make it a game I would seek out to play.

Le terme Hoyuk en turc est similaire au Tell du Proche et du Moyen-Orient. Il fait reference aux collines qui sont en fait les restes de villes antiques ou préhistoriques, constituées des couches successives d'occupations de ces communautés souvent millénaires.
Hoyuk est un jeu de construction et de placement, avec une part de négociation. Chaque joueur représente un clan qui lie ses familles à d'autres clans pour fonder une nouvelle ville.

Rating after 1 play. An area majority set collection game that was somewhat disappointing in its execution.
Placing buildings on a map to create said majorities and acquire card with differing symbols in an attempt to create sets that are turned in for scoring. 
The scoring opportunities seemed very restrictive and it took a long time to finish.

I might give it one more chance,  but it probably wouldn't change my initial impression much.

An interesting take on civ building, this title is a gamier version of Medina, with the various building assets and decent implementation of the set collection mechanic giving it much more weight. Some fantastic wooden components (of so many of the assets) really bring the game to life. There is a lot to enjoy here - if only the Obstacles expansion weren't a blatant cash-in that should have been included as standard...

Ekkorát talán még nem csalódtam játékban. Majdnem backeltem ks-en, de nagyon jól tettem, hogy mégis sikerült valahogy elkerülnöm. Gyakorlatilag nincs érdemi döntés a játék során. Háromféle többséget építgetünk, minden körben jön egy kiszámíthatatlan katasztrófa, ami lemos egy rakás épületet. Ezután minden kör végén a jobban álló játékosokat tovább tápolja a játék. Ergo, ha az első körből rosszul jössz, ki akkor végigasszisztálhatod onnantól a játékot. A hógolyó effektet még fájdalmasabbá teszi, hogy mint minden többségi játékban, a kört kezdő játékosnak hatalmas a hátránya. Namost az első körben ez random dől el, és onnantól meg jön a hógolyó. Egyszerűen röhejesen szerencsealapú, és nem balanszolt ez a játék. El nem tudom képzelni, hogy lehet 6 fölött az átlaga.

A szabály se valami jó sajnos, egyedül az alkatrészekre nem lehet panasz.

The rulebook for this one wasn't very good, but once I made it over the hurdle of understanding how to play, I found a decent tile-laying game. There are some aspects of the game that definitely feel like Kickstarter bloat (e.g., if all building tiles have two houses and a third thing, why not include just a small deck of cards with that third thing?), but I didn't dislike the game. It's subtle and has some interesting scoring mechanisms and trade-offs. I'll need to try it with more people and the advanced stuff to make a final decision on it.

(12/04/2014) Comment based on one play.

A Sim-City-like game of tile laying, developing small settlements during pre-historic times. Deceptively easy to play, but hard to wrap one's head around initially.

As a group, we struggled through the basic rules and collectively poorly played our first game. Most of the game, we clumsily worked through the actions, wondering if this was supposed to make any sense. 

Each turn players get two template tiles, each allowing them to build a minimum of two houses on the map, as well as a third tile that may be one of three elements: pens, ovens, or temples. After the first turn, there is disaster phase where settlements are affected by some random event. Then, there is an evaluation phase where for each "block" (a settlement with groupings of several players' houses) for the three element categories. Having the most in a category allows the player to draw a random card from a given category deck.

The objective is to try to collect sets of cards to score points, as well as build the largest group within every settlement by the end of the game. The cards can be optionally turned in to build more houses or other elements.

It is basically a "king-of-the-hill" type of pissing contest within each settlement, in order to win the scoring cards. There is also some tactical considerations as to the layout of houses within a block, so as to be robust enough to survive the various disasters that occur each turn. The basic game was boring, with a lack of meaningful choices, and with three players and three categories, each player uniquely dominated one of the three categories. The board was large enough to see the growth of a number of settlements, but there was no terrain or anything interesting to drive the shape and size of each settlement.

It is interesting that there is a "medium" game and an "advanced" game, where more and more cards are available, as well as more categories to score in. Still, we quickly surmised that it would be more of the same trivial and senseless choices--there is no way to predict the disasters, and we are simply reacting to what the other players lay before us. It may be interesting with more players, but again, the fundamental play is not substantive. We're willing to give it another chance, but it doesn't look good. This is yet another Kickstarter that looks good with components, but is seriously lacking in the play, and it really shouldn't have seen the light of day. Initial rating: "4" with room to drop quickly, if the second play doesn't stir us with excitement.

A tile laying game where you strive to maximise points by building specific features in settlements across the board. Plenty of strategic decisions need to be made.

I had higher hopes for this game than what actually hit the table.  I really found some parts of the rulebook to be confusing in places.  My caveat is I played this game at 2, so increased player counts may help my impression.  I did think the components and artwork were good quality and liked the theme and the idea of the game, it just fell flat with 2.  Traded away the game.

Tile laying set collection abstract game with a loose theme, simple rules, some depth in it and a good deal of decisions to make. Sadly, decisions from other players and random factors (what catastrophes, where they hit and decisions from other players) seem to count 10 times more than your own decisions. Not a game for me.

Also, I know it has a big board and 80 wooden components, but it is REALLY expensive on Kickstarter, at least for us European guys. $65 for a tile laying game? Will it retail for even more than $65? Come on.

Gioco completamente senza mordente, ripetitivo e noioso difficilmente programmabile e con interazione talmente forte da renderlo decisamente casuale. Poco sentita l'ambientazione, grafica deludente con un tabellone che non ha nessun criterio visto che si possono costruire gli insdiamenti anche sul fiume; meccaniche poco originali, il gioco non mi ha dato proprio il desiderio di riprovarlo. Infine la casualità sulle catastrofi rende il tutto ancora più radomico.

[i]Impression after one play (medium level).[/i]

With the power of almighty Kickstarter an 8 years old PnP game gets a proper release. And you can tell it's an older design unlike these contemporary clockwork victory point salads. Because one does not get points easily in Hoyuk and it's as clunky as an old Soviet tractor (not as sturdy though, but you can probably compost the game to create fuel for the said Soviet tractor).

It's a tile laying area control of sorts - you build villages and in every village the one with most in whatever category gets a card. Then you trade sets of cards for points. Got that? Let's repeat: you do stuff and this stuff does nothing, but if you have majorities in stuff, then you get cards, and to get points you have to collect sets of cards and turn them in but you can spend only as many cards each turn. Got it? Good! You already feel like it's 2005 don't you?

There are mirages of choices in the game. One is in getting sets of cards - you probably could plan what cards you get, if you're the first player (who nobody wants to be for all other reasons), otherwise you're at the mercy of that player. And the first player could optimise, but then it will cause serious AP and everybody looking at them angrily, so let's presumer it's mostly random what you get. Second mirage of choice is - the game determines which is your 3rd action per turn (by a random tile each player gets). Why? Even worse -  the game occasionally rewards a random player with a tile that allows for choices? So instead of giving me a choice the game randomly assigns what I can do, but sometimes it assigns me that I can choose. That's fucked up and the worse case of bad parenting - either give me choices or don't. Reasoning behind this distribution of actions is bizarre - it doesn't make the game quicker as often it's harder to figure out what to do with an action you don't need than with one you do. It also doesn't mitigate the first player disadvantage, at least not enough. Instead of randomly assigning these action tiles you could give first player the right to chose one of the possible ones. That would make sense (El Grande way).

What I'm describing above is an old clunky design that wasn't addressed by developers or publishers. But they did do stuff and change bits. Unfortunately, I might add. I went to check the old rules from PnP version I had on my computer at the time.
1. - They removed the rule which allowed for building up to whatever height which created a really lovely visual aspect and was the point of the game (this type of building in layers some older civilisations had). The rule was a bit more complicated - you needed to check there's a step difference all the way to the ground level. So, you could say they removed a complicated rule, but just guess what they did instead...
2. The game comes in 3 flavours - simple, medium and [-]tedium[/-] advanced or something. Difference is: in simple (which is what the PnP version was) you fight for majorities in 3 categories  and have cards in 3 suits which you try to collect sets in. Medium is the same, but you compete in 5 categories and have 5 suits in advanced the same in 7 categories/suits. I hope you understand the idiocy behind it. Instead of a thematic rule that makes sense and puts incentive for building higher (because being higher is a tie breaker for majorities) you now have the simpler rules copy pasted, so effectively same stuff doubled or tripled, because everybody knows more rules (and bits) is better. Instead of incentive to build higher (from PnP version), you now have one category you score for being higher (but only 2 levels up). Okay, you might said that's streamlined, but  then remember that with all these adding of categories there's not only more of the tediously samey stuff you're trying to build and compete in, there is also more suits of cards making it even harder to make sets (thus making the whole thing even more chaotic and random). Let's recap: they removed the thematic rule which made the game what it was and instead copy pasted some rules and bits the game already had and in the process made the game bloated, samey, long, tedious and more random. Facepalm.  And of course, let's not forget:
3. They didn't fix the actual issues of the original game (as described above) - it's as clunky as it always was. But crimes of publishers do not end here.
4. They added a board. A hideous dark murky thing that's totally unnecessary, illogical (you can build over lakes and rivers as if they weren't there), ugly (grid isn't done by simple lines, no, it's some gimmick with shading that just looks terrible). Probably we were totally awful players but to us it seemed that those 100 point track around the board wasn't justified (we got to 40-50). Scoring is so rare that it could be done by victory point tokens anyway.
5. Art in general is not as good as in PnP edition as hard as it is to wrap one's mind around this sentence. PnP edition had simple line art as was representative in the period depicted; the tiles looked like archaeological ruins, which makes sense. It looked clean and evocative. Now it's some computer made (or computer coloured) kitsch. Different player colours have now houses with distinct designs. Which look weirder when put sideways and at least to my un-archaeological eye seem more like some imaginary fantasy dwellings than what people in that period actually built. And on top of it ... this is just so mind boggling ... in advanced version each tribe has a special action, yes only in advanced game. They don't look balanced btw., but the best part: the prerequisite for using an action is so hard to achieve that my best estimate is that a player is most likely to get 1 special action per game (or none or maybe 2). What's this option doing in the game?

In the end: an example of a bad boardgame archaeology practice - digging up an older game, not tidying up its problems and rough edges, but adding on it more stuff, more problems and a questionable facial lift. One should venerate ancestors and leave them buried. A walking dead with new robotic arms and a lipstick serves no one.

[i]The best part about the whole experience was reclaiming 13 MB on my computer disk for deleting the PnP files. Worst part: a lot of people around me ordered it and I will probably see it in our next local math trade.[/i]

Edit: lowered rating because I hope such disastrous development doesn't happen again.

Not for me.  I like the tension of cards-for-buildings vs cards-for-points, but the build-catastrophe-score rhythm means that either (a) most of the time half of your decisions are meaningless or that (b) half of the time most of your decisions are meaningless.  And the game does not mix newbies and experienced players well at all; knowing/deciding when to start a new block, when to join a new block, what to do there and why, counting catastrophe cards, &c.

Tried it with 3 players at Bremen spielt this year ... the rules are aweful. After an extremely bad attempt to let someone from the booth explain the rules to us we tried taking it again and from the top ... while trying to play there still were many unanswered questions so we quit after nearly two hours.
Too bad because I really love the artwork.

Stone age 3D city building tile placement simulation with a Sim City catastrophe aspect. I dig the choice of the Neolithic period of a patchworked amalgamation of settlements as a people come together to survive and expansion comes from need and without forethought or plan. The mechanics capture the theme. To win and gain advantage of the aspects you must build community blocks together AND start separate blocks. Love this strategy objective and can't think of another game that does this? Building vertically to break majority tie is another great mechanic that ties well to theme. This is pure tile placing strategy and I find myself missing the satisfaction of acquiring resources to build those ovens and shrines and such. I also like the concept of player negotiating deals to take first player each round. As for roads, who needs 'em? I've got a perfectly good roof to crawl through.

Apparently this game was designed back in 2005, or maybe 2006; whatever, it was a long time ago. I mean, I didn't even know they made games back then. What I'm trying to say is that this game can't be any good, because it's so old and it's not like the other games I like, and I think I might actually cry thinking about how awful it was to be forced (I mean, literally [i]forced[/i]) to play it.... Old games are always inferior to new games, because they are less new and shiny, and they don't play the same. And another thing: the rules don't even make sense thematically. This is totally unlike so many board games. What was the designer thinking! Oh, and don't get me started about development: this game obviously had no developer, because some rules were changed from the PnP version and if it had been properly developed this wouldn't have happened, and I probably would have scored it a 3, maybe. Someone should go back in time and make sure that this and all other old games are expunged from reality. That way there can be no more old games.

It's a very good game in my opinion; I only have a little objection to sometimes gamey endgame conditions (I specifically mean developing your last city). After a couple more plays I expect the rating to go up a little.

I wish, like Spinal Tap, I could rate this an 11.  This is my all-time favorite game.  I have played this numerous times, as I was involved in the playtesting for years.  No matter how much I play it, I seem to always discover new things about the inner-workings of the game.

The game is the next evolution in the deckbuilding wargame mechanic first created by [thing=79828][/thing] and while there are obvious similarities, this one goes to an entirely different level.  The game play is not at all like Acres.  This is more of your classic "knife fight in a phone booth" because you are fighting over 3 islands and do not score victory points for holding on to your initial settlements.  You must expand and conquer.  The sides are asymmetrical, but not as much as Acres.  For instance, both sides raise money differently, but both sides can raise a lot of money.

Units are different: Rome has more heavy infantry and leaders, but Carthage has more cavalry and they have the powerful, yet unpredictable elephants.  Carthage has cheaper units, but they are more susceptible to bribes.

The game also has turns -- yes, turns!  Carthage controls the flow of the game, but Rome has the advantage on the strategy cards, which is a way to legally bend the rules.

The game also has random events.  These are not game breakers, but they are setbacks, that you have to deal with.

Best of all, this game has a naval element which is critical to supply.

The trick to the game is to implement your plan and adjust to the events, strategy cards, and most importantly what your opponent is doing.  But you must dictate the strategy and keep him on the defensive and reacting to you, rather than the other way around.

Unlike many deck builders, where the choices can be a bit obvious, this one is far from that.  You have numerous choices each turn and sticking with your plan while reacting to your opponent and churning your deck is a real art.

If you want more details, you can see my video review or read my written review.

Finally, while the game play carries the day, what shot this from #3 to #1 on my All-Time game list was the final product.  The game play alone was enough to make it a top 3 game, but the end result was stunning.  This game is gorgeous.  The components are excellent.  The art is gripping and the mounted boards are high quality.  Knight Works really outdid my expectations.

Also, to be clear, I did not make a dime off of this game.  I playtested it, but I bought my Kickstarter copy just like everybody else did.  I would have it no other way.

Update: There is a guy claiming he has an unbeatable Roman strategy.  He tried it out on his beginner Carthaginian player friends and "proved" the point, because the best way to prove a game is broken is by beating players who don't really know the game, ya know?  Anyway, after he assured me I was not "thinking outside the box" I revealed exactly what this thinking was (gee, ya think I haven't spent 3 years thinking about everything you can do in this game?) and I offered to play him twice and I would take Carthage.  That was a month ago.  I am still waiting on a response.  I am not holding my breath.  Lessons to be learned: a) There's always a bigger fish, and b) There is no "Halifax Hammer" strategy.

This is a deck building wargame that takes 2+ hours to play. I feel the Carthaginian player has to score big early and watch his lead be eroded away by the better funded Romans. Interesting concepts but it requires a big commitment of time to play and there are many games that compete or that big slice of time

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: Having Kickstarted this game, I'd been waiting for it for almost a year longer than expected. I'm happy to say that after my first playthrough the game was worth the wait. This game tells the story of the First Punic War and both sides play fairly asymmetrically. The Carthaginians clearly have a naval advantage in the beginning of the game and the Romans are awarded an initial Legion. For those people who've played A Few Acres of Snow, this game will be easy to pick up, with only a few added mechanisms. However, those additions make this game feel much meatier and more wargame-like. Although much is still left abstract, there's enough going on that this doesn't just feel like a deckbuilder with a board. After our initial playthrough, I was left with a number of "what if" thoughts that definitely make me want to get this game back to the table soon.

The game definitely has some legs, and while I enjoyed the game, I am not sure I enjoyed it enough to give it the amount of plays it needs to really shine.  The deck building aspect is really interesting, as you have to balance your deck building with dealing with your opponent on the board.  Found the rules to be awful, which was disappointing since this game took awhile to get into the hands of backers.  Also found the graphic design to be meh... having some issues that actually made some aspects of the cards a bit tough to understand.  The asymmetrical aspect of it was neat, and the two sides definitely seemed like they played different.  One I am for sure willing to play again, but not sure it needs to be my copy.

Haven't played it yet and am currently working through the rules.  The concept intrigues me greatly, so am giving it a try just because it is a deck building wargame.  Not sure when I'll get to try it; hopefully in the next few weeks.  Will upgrade my rating at that point.

So far the rules seem straightforward enough.  Do have to reread the combat bits again, but that's from being so bold as to start reading the rules at 1130PM.

Played once and enjoyed; not totally sure if it has legs. Vastly improved over A Few Acres of Snow, although it still could have afforded to separate itself from that game a bit more I think. The 1st Punic actually seems like a much better fit for the system than the 7YW. Hard to tell from one play, just because it is such a distinctive game.

Many graphic misfires obscure a generally attractive product. The outline fonts are particularly egregious. Sticking to the minimalist presentation of AFAoS has made the game much more opaque than it needs to be - connectivity is very hard to visualize, especially by sea. What cities provide what resources (particularly wine) make it hard to know where and how to fight in strategically sensible ways without resorting to flipping through a bunch of cards. I get that it was done to emphasize the kinship with AFAoS, which is popular in some circles. But Martin Wallace games are usually much harder to play than they need to be because they seem to delight in needlessly obscuring game details.

I haven't done more than scratch the surface of this game in solo play, but I recognize very attractive mechanics and a great thematic fit overall. Not sure if it is the automatic go to 1st Punic War game (being totally unable to invade Africa bugs me slightly) now that Hamilcar will be hitting the market soon, but it very well may be. More plays will see my comment updated.

Compared to Berg's Carthage and the Campaign Commander game though, I think this one might easily come out on top when stressing game over simulation value. Carthage is a monster and Punic Island is a lot more scripted than this, so this might hit the sweet spot.

Finally, I am giving this game a pure 10 owing to the great customer service when dealing with the card errata.

I love A Few Acres of Snow and was really excited about Hands in the Sea as it worked off the same system.

But, whereas AFAOS wins for its complex yet relatively simple game-play (a lot of options, but those options are easy to conduct), Hands in the Sea muddies the water a bit with some more rules and additions. Especially, the event cards are way too random and swingy.

Some certainly enjoy these added complexities and layers, but just not me.

I did some play testing for this game, and really liked it.  Simple basic game system, but has some interesting subtleties that affect play as well.  Deep historical research, and a variety of strategies available to both sides.  Rather more asymmetric than many games, which is an accurate reflection of the strengths of each side - dominance at sea for Carthage, and on land for Rome.

Great game, highly recommended.

Bumped up to 8 now.

Like a certain struggle in the twilight, Hands in the Sea gets exponentially better when both players are informed and have a good idea of what to expect.  As in my previous comment (below), the overwhelming number of possible actions you can take make it difficult to understand and assess the consequences of choosing two over all the others when you're first embarking on this journey.  With more plays, the picture becomes clearer and you're strategizing instead of experimenting.  At this point, you can start fiddling with your deck with more confidence, look for the strategy card that works for what you're attempting to accomplish and find all kinds of ways to thwart your opponent's efforts.  With so many cards to choose from, exploring the different strategies can be an exciting prospect, but man, that initial hump was a doozy.

===

This game probably deserves a higher rating, but my mind just can't right now.  It can't.  Hands in the Sea appears to demand a lot of your attention and I don't mean in one game.  I mean you gotta play this thing over and over again and study it and figure it out and your opponent also needs to be on that ride or you will just run all over them as strategies emerge.

I can safely say this, though - your first play will be overwhelming.  Maybe not for Acres vets, but it's got that Euro sensibility of "HERE ARE 100 OPTIONS, CHOOSE 2 HAHAHAHAHA" and you have to sit there and try and figure out just what you ought to be doing.  Protip: you won't know.  You can't know.  But every action available to you serves a purpose - it's just that the strategy can be elusive on your first play so you'll just go through the motions and win or lose by accident.

Only after getting my ass kicked by 20+ points did I realize what I had been doing wrong, but it took 5 hours to get there.  That's not a hit against this game whatsoever, but man did I ever feel pressure and despair and I wept for Carthage.

Excellent card building game. After a few plays just to learn the cards and their potential use, the game offers tons of strategy options. For every plan a player can make there is the possibility for a counter measure his opponent can adopt since the pace of play is slow. Nothing happens abruptly or as a surprise. Each player has to watch carefully how his opponent builds his deck and what strategy card is using. This two things give a lot of time for plan preparation.
Timing is key to success. Not every battle needs to be victorious. A draw or even a small loss can open opportunities for the losing side to have some gains as it takes time for the victor to consolidate his position.
The tension is high from the first hand draw until the end of the game that can happen with a lot of ways.
The historical recreation is high.
The wooden kick starter components are marvelous.
The rulebook is not perfect but ok. After some plays the player's aid cards are all that needed for occasional reference.
The optional event and strategy cards are highly recommended for a less lucky and punishing play.
My 10 is based in the joy the game is giving me as a whole concept.

A superior game in the deck-building category on the First Punic War. Its learning curve is steeper than necessary, however, due to a map presentation and rules layout that do not seem to have been fully proofread. Why have a map with unlabeled tracks? Why have a player's aid that lacks critical information. Why do the rules lack examples and illustrations gamers have come to expect in such a physically well-produced game? But if you are willing to put in the extra work needed to play this game as the designer envisioned you will end up having a great gaming experience.

RATING: N/A
I have play tested this game several times. Dan Berger's game of the First Punic War is a very nice evolutionary step in the "A Few Acres of Snow" game system by Martin Wallace.

The game is very entertaining. The re-playability is high as there are plenty of strategies to pursue.  It can be completed in a single evening sitting.

Asymmetry of opponents is interesting. There are ways to counter opposing strengths while maintaining the ability to keep him/her off balance with your strengths. 

Random events deck throws some good twists into the game that each player may have to deal with in different manners.  There are more random events than turns/game so that you will not necessarily see the same ones from game to game.

There are many more cards available than you can possibly build into your deck in any single game. This enhances re-playability and allows many strategies to explore

I think this game will make a big splash in the deck building/boardgame hybrid system. I am really looking forward to the finished product!

Bought for me by a very generous friend. I didn't like my one play of A Few Acres of Snow and I don't have a strong affinity for deck building, but I think this game is a better and more open development of the system. There are a lot of options without a clear path to follow, it's pretty abstract and I don't really agree with some of the historical decisions, like the mechanical emphasis on detail in land warfare over naval warfare, which is at odds with my knowledge of the First Punic War. I still enjoy it and I'm keen to try the expansion, particularly the modified Events which I understand are less swingy than the originals. I expect that as I play more games and get a stronger feel for it, my rating will rise. I do wonder how much time I'll have to devote to it when the Hamilcar game for the new Hannibal: RvC is released.

RATING: 9
A beautiful game that really feels like it captures this conflict.  War, battles, sieges, and fleet engagements do happen, but they are not the core of the game, which is deck management.  Expansion and economic development matter, but not if your army is weak.  After a few plays, I feel Rome is harder to play. Very enjoyable game.

I recommend playing with the optional rules for less severe events and maintenance costs for the strategy cards.  A bad run of events against you is not so much fun, and the costs for the strategy card keep you from using a single one the whole game; both more interesting and makes the order that the cards come out less swingy.

24 pages or so has me wondering if that's too much for what it is

Edit - Just played AFAOS, and it does leave me wanting more, as in more of a true wargame with the Deck building element to it so this has risen closer to top of thinking about it list. I did think the map in AFAOS was a little small and with limited cities to expand to and it seems this one has even a few less which gives me pause. (although we have a nice sea element here)

Edit 2 - Just read Judd's great review (ty Judd) and now see it is very similar to Acres, and probably a little more than I was hoping. Lots of little differences and subtleties to be sure (Sea rules and strat cards nice wrinkles and should be good strategic & situational additions. Probably not a fan of the events though and might even omit them if too intrusive [trouble is too rolling for them may not even out so someone gets shafted] At the end of the day I want an opponent to mess me up not a random event), and they'll make it it's own game with very different strategies no question, but the core is very much the same and while I like Acres, well I only "like it" and wished it was more of a wargame which this held promise for. What it seems is HitS uses a very similar abstracted movement and combat system which to me leaves it short of a true wargame (If you aren't moving dudes around on the map, flanking, taking step losses, terrain effects, using strat moves etc well...Note the sea rules do bring a little war and are closer to what I was hoping for). Anyone who loved Acres and/or quit playing due to lots of play or the HH will surely be very pleased here

FIRST IMPRESSION:
 
Definitely see the parts of A Few Acres of Snow inspiration involved! One really has to work at setting up attacks/raids/development. Uncertain how I feel about the random event that occurs whenever the Carthage player runs through their deck. One rolls a die and it is usually a 50/50 chance as to who bears the brunt of the pain or gets lucky once in a blue moon. When you lose that die roll several turns in a  row, it can start making your plans fall apart quickly - IE, don't start an attack on another front if an event is occurring during that time that could destroy the best laid plans. Played aides are fairly solid, but the rules feel like they leave some things open to interpretation. The raid ability can be pretty strong and players need to be aware of it and how to potentially counter it. Not surprisingly, the game falls into a bit of a predictable slog with Rome or Carthage coming either through Sicily or Corsica to Pisa. Deckbuilding is important - nothing worse than cycling through useless cards trying to get what one needs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First Punic War.  People say it is a deck-building wargame, and I do find it similar to Mage Knight (!) in the combat system with the cards in your hand (I played A Few Acres of Snow before but I was not impressed).  Instead, I feel the combat system looks more alike to the classic AH game "Hannibal" in which both sides keep to play the combat cards until one side runs out of them from the hand.  In Hands in the Sea, nonetheless, combat can take more than one round easily due to two stalemate boxes on the battle track.  But I would not say Hands in the Sea is more of a deck-building exercise because you don't have much influence of what would be the next random cards from the draw deck.  Your hand is not long enough, a basic of five cards, to make some planning meaningful.  You can extend it by reserving your cards into the reserve deck and then call them back into your hand at one cost per card with free action.  

The Battle Track is quite an interesting design.  It is a place to resolve combat at a location like a sort of tug-of-war.  The intrinsic defense value is 1 for each location and if the location is fortified, the initial defense value would be 3.  It is further modified with the bonus defense value of the location (1 or 2).  The attacking player then play a card and move the cube on the track back to his side according to the number of sword symbols (battle strength) on the card.  Both sides (except for neutrals) take turns to reinforce the place.  In the beginning of each action round of a turn, the battle is resolved to see if there is an advantage in strength of 2 or more on either side of the Battle Track, who would claim victory and take control of the location.  Battle lasts four rounds for an unfortified and six rounds for a fortified location.  A battle token is available in the game to help keep track of the progress.  Since each player would have two rounds in a turn, it means that a battle would last for two to four turns maximum.  

To initiate a battle in a location, however, you need preparation.  This is where it tells how hard it would be to mount a field battle or siege without adequate preparation. In game term, you have to have the "right" cards in hand. The combination is the location card that connects to the battle location, a second card which can supply the battle via either land (a cart symbol on the card) or naval (a galley), and the third card for battle strength (sword).   If you are lucky to win the battle, you need another card with colonist to establish a town in the location if it contains a colonist symbol on the map.  You don't need a specific card to conduct a siege against fortified town or city but to have combined arm advantage in field battle, you may play Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry and Cavalry cards to increase battle strength by one.  Obviously this requires successive play of the cards in three rounds out of the four available in a field battle.  You cannot use combined arms to siege.  I quite like all these rules as they convey a sense how rare a large scale of operations with more sophisticated organization could happen in ancient warfare.  If a player wins the battle, he would earn the location card and one prestige point.   

The situation on the map would stablize once both sides dig in with fortifications on key frontline cities in Syracuse and Corsica islands.  Rapid expansion might be penalized as the Carthaginians fleet blocked off the Roman supply to Corsica colonies and keep cashing-in from them with pillage operations.  The colonies were out of supply and could not receive reinforcements from Rome.  VPs were lost every other two to three pillages.  It was a double-blow to Roman economy and glory.  Rome, forced to send out rescue with Corvus on board, was not able to take back the colonies when she lost the sea battle to Carthage.  There are quite a few roads to victory and strategies are prioritized according to the road you chose.  Overall, a very beautiful game.  If you like serious Euroish wargame, this is a definitely for you.  I might raise the rating up after a few more repeated plays after knowing more the juicy parts in the system.  (Note: after 9 games, I do think the game is slightly in favor of Rome.)

Basé sur les règles de A Few Acres of Snow. Les ajouts par rapport à celui ci valent-ils vraiment le coup ? + long à expliquer car plus d'actions et de micro détails, suspense pas forcément très épais (et fin de partie parfois longues à arrivée malgré tout). Pas encore convaincu par l'intérêt profond de la mer et des flottes à part squatter la Corse (+ de pillage peut être)... Simplification de la gestion de la main en remplaçant par une simple action la carte permettant d'alléger son deck. Du coup on se sent plus rarement bloqué. De plus on semble avoir un peu plus souvent de l'argent notamment grâce aux fins de campagne. Certains événements piquent un peu (trop ?).
Sans doute pas moins bon, à approfondir certainement parce qu'il est de toute évidence plutôt plaisant, mais de là à le sortir plus que AFAOS ou qu'un autre jeu pour 2, vu l'investissement nécessaire, je ne sais pas... Et comme il fait doublon avec AFAOS, revente envisagée de l'un ou l'autre.

I like it much better than A Few Acres of Snow: it feels less constrained in approaches for going after the opponent.  Unfortunately, JeroenD got a major rule wrong and we ended way too early.  But the deck building aspect was not too painful, and the sea control was cleverly done to make it nice and clear.  Some good choices to make.  

4/'17: Played a full, correct game with James and thorougly enjoyed it.  Once we got rolling, the game buzzed along, although ended up much longer than two hours.  Lots if options, but I need to figure out how to avoid deck bloat.  The random events are damn nasty!

Much richer in mechanics and options than A Few Acres of Snow. It seems to me that more development could have made the game more streamlined and perhaps a bit shorter. Nevertheless, the balancing and variety of strategies seems to be good.

One annoyance: You need a list of which places are connected by ship as it is not printed on the map. Connectivity is not even symmetric.

All that said, would prefer to play this over AFAoS.

Update: Bought the game based on my first play. Thought that the gameplay is really enjoyable and tense.

Solid adaption of Martin Wallace's A Few Acres of Snow.  Well into our first game, we played the Pillage action incorrectly and decided to start over.  The second game played faster and we were able to sort out any questions that came up.  Have the FAQ handy.  The game itself is a lot of fun and there are many actions to choose from each turn.  As the Romans, I quickly conquered Corsica until the Carthaginian navy cut off my supply line, rendering my towns defenseless, and took it back rather easily gaining a lot of VPs in the process.  Lesson: Naval superiority is important!

Not a fan of deck building games at all. This game is no exception. Better than A Few Acres of Snow because of the multi-use cards. The game does move at a quick pace, and the game is rather short.

However, I don't feel the theme at all. The game (expectedly) is all about managing your deck. There are so many options (which is also expected in a deck building game in order to increase card diversity), which unfortunately distract what a war game should be about -- attacking your opponent.

Seems to have more variety and heft than A Few Acres of Snow, with the naval struggle adding a new dimension with difficult choices and trade-offs.  The strategy deck offers a chance to explore different strategies, while ratcheting the tension up even more. Polished and well integrated system. With the frequent campaign scoring compounding VP advantages, however, there may be a runaway issue. Once your opponent is four or five VP up on you, it looks like it's going to very difficult to reel him in. 

Rule book is poorly laid, and it's hard to find stuff. And this game really needs a map showing all the connections between locations - we missed several crucial ones in both games. However, the play aids and other components are all nice.

Wonderful evolution of A Few Acres of Snow, I especially like the event deck and the Strategy Cards.

However, after 5 plays this game already feels a bit stale, as the start of the game is so scripted. We'll see how this develops after a couple more plays ...

RATING: 9
This is a straight-up adaptation of A Few Acres of Snow to the First Punic War with the only significant addition being introduction of actual fleets. In most cases, I'd probably be appalled by the lack of innovation -- however, there was plenty of innovation in the original and a better implementation was needed, which Hands in the Sea delivers in full. The game seems well-balanced and the mechanics seem to fit perhaps even better for the attritional and long-term nature of the First Punic War. But the events can seem a bit harsh and random, and settlement of locations in Sicily is a thematic quirk I'm not sure about.

Two games under my belt. I like it quite a bit. Deck builder strategy game where the strategic choices really matter. I need to play it a lot more to get a good sense of how deep it can go and where the flaws might be.

Good points: Good choices, plays fairly smoothly, good component quality, decent art.
Bad points: Rules are a little finicky (some exceptions and things that are easy to forget). Art is decent but has a few weak spots. Randomness, especially with the events, can be annoying.

To note: 90-120 minutes seem a bit optimistic. I suppose it could get down to 120 once both players get very familiar with the rules.

2p deck building and war game done better than A Few Acres of Snow. 24 possible actions each round means you have a LOT to consider and cover. Can score points through developing or conquest. Little downtime as you take two actions and then it's the next player's turn. It does have a slow build up and can be difficult to cobble together the right resources on cards to do certain actions, but for the patient it is rewarding. Strategy and event cards give each game new life and personality and hamper scripted play. Connoisseurs game.

This game is a bit more difficult to learn than it should be. It's not so much that the choices are odd, but some things aren't explained very well (or sometimes not at all). 

Tons of player options, has a decent player aid that's still missing a few salient points in the action summaries.

The two asymmetrical decks portray the historical strengths and weaknesses of both sides very well. Still, the history portrayed is *very* suspect at times.

Great topic for the AFAOS system - this is a terrific design as long as you're willing to invest the time into it and can overlook some of the design's inherent problems.

Biggest disappointment for me in a while. I love card driven games and I love multi use cards so I though this was THE war game for me. The reason I love them is the tension created by trying to balance my options. Instead of giving me cool options to choose from, the cards in this one felt constrictive and frustrating. I'd look at my hand and just felt like I was trying to figure out which crappy option was the least crappy instead of which exciting option is best for me.

After 6 plays, it seems tougher to discern a viable Roman strategy. They're on the ass end of most random events, start at a historically appropriate naval disadvantage and have no control over the pace of the game. It's a vast improvement of A Few Acres of Snow, but I had hoped for more of a tense slugfest.

02-19-18: i've updated this to 10. the advanced combat scratches the only itch I had and the 2nd edition fate token is a nice touch to help even out some of the extreme variability without nerfing events.

10-01-17: this game is amazing and every play reveals new intricacies and subtleties. the only thing keeping it from being a 10 is I would like a little more depth to combat system (there is a variant rule by designer for more tactile combat but it doesn't add as much as I would like). The other thing is the random events can go on a hot run against one player and tip the balance more than I think is idea. I would suggest substituting a 2D6 roll or using a fate marker to adjust future event dice so that both sides get hit and have their plans interrupted. 

These are minor quibbles, it's just about the perfect game.

Two player wargame between Rome and Carthage set during the First Punic War.  Driven by an symmetric deck builder using cards to control military, develop economy and manage politics or spent for resources if occupying the matching territory.  Great deck management rules usually spending actions or turns to bend your deck or hand to your needs. Very important to build economy or raid to pay for deck manipulation, implement strategy cards and withstand events.

If you like A Few Acres of Snow, there's a good chance that you'll like Hands in the Sea.  But it's not guaranteed.  I was hoping for a bigger departure from the Acres system, but that's not what I got.  Which is not the fault of the designer, of course - it's just my own preference.

My biggest complaint is that the deck/board mechanics are too slowly paced, too non-confrontational, and too frustrating.  Yes, there are land battles in HitS, but sometimes there are only 1-2 over the course of the entire game.  (I partly blame fortifications for this; see below.) That means, for me, the fun is minimized.  To provide some context, I love block wargames - with their maneuver and constant combat - and deck-building conflict games (and many CDGs) seem to be on the opposite end of the conflict/maneuver spectrum.

My biases aside, I see a few issues that could have been addressed during playtesting and development.  Inasfar as I'm the benevolent dictator of perfect game creation and all that.

Things that I wish were different:

As much as the game prides itself on slow-burning strategy, certain aspects of the game are abrupt, chaotic, and swingy.  The amount of chaos in a game should be inversely proportional to the game's length, and HitS violates this basic principle. The two main culprits: random events and naval combat.

The designer posted somewhere that he considered replacing the original events with the alternate versions (available as [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/208989/hands-sea-kickstarter-expansion]an expansion[/url]), and he should have gone with his instinct.  The original events are downright unpleasant, as they're often merciless and unfair.  The Naval Disaster card can cost a player up to 8 actions and 24 gold to rebuild, which is insane.  The card might as well say [i]Roll one die and then flip the table[/i]. Minimally, events should have been included that affect *both* players, not just one of them.  There's nothing worse than watching the losing player (Ok, me) suffer numerous negative events in a row, which is nearly as fun as watching salt get plowed into my fields.

What is boils down to is that first impressions matter. I can't tell you how many games I've permanently avoided based on a single unpleasant play, and the events almost push HitS into that category.  I managed to hang around for game #2, but some players will ditch the game solely because of the events.  Personally, I'll never use the original events again (rating with originals = 4).  I'm also switching to the upkeep-based strategy cards, which I'll try next time.  

And then there's naval combat. Control of the seas has a tremendous impact on the game, but it mostly comes down to how many 5s and 6s a player can roll.  This is not one of those games where bad luck evens out based on the sheer number of die rolls.  There aren't many rolls, so each one matters.  I never thought I'd say this, but I think a CRT for naval combat should have been used - one that makes losses more balanced, though still retaining the possibility of unlikely (but fair) upsets.

Anyway, once a player establishes complete and total naval dominance, Sardinia-Corsica becomes a one-sided affair and the pillage train starts rolling.  The dominated player's coffers can be plundered turn after turn (assuming ship symbols are available), which can cause the game to turn sour. As soon as a player has no consistent cashflow, they can't buy cards, they can't use their reserve, and they can't purchase more warships to get back in the game.  Nonstop pillaging starts to feel like spousal abuse, with all that implies.

Finally, the fortifications. I'm not sure if they're too cheap, or if there's some other issue, but once a line of fortifications is established across Sicily the game becomes a chore.  Yes, there are siege engines to break the chokeholds, but good luck with those if you've got no money as the result of a pillage beatdown.

Clearly, however, there's an audience that doesn't mind the chaos and thinks the measured pacing is appropriate. And I'm still interested in playing more, with an eye towards improving my purchasing, attacking, and deck-thinning skills. But I'm not willing to invest in 15+ games to find the deep fun in the system and master its strategic intricacies.  The payoff isn't there for me.  If my enjoyment isn't dramatically increased by game six, I'm OK with abandoning HitS and finally learning EastFront.  That's more my bag.

Played once so far, fantastic old west theme.  Having the bullets in the bag with a draw mechanism was interesting.  Shootouts between players were fun to watch/participate in as it is quite literally 1,2,3 draw and bullets go flying.

RATING: 7.5
Capturing all the elements of the Old West can be tough.  This game does so, but at the expense of 1 critical piece.  First though, the elements.  Cattle rustling, gold rush, busting broncos, stage coaches, desperadoes and lawmen, and gun fights - all have a place in the game.  Each has its own way of working and each actually works well.  The bullet draw as a randomizer is quite fun, especially if your copy included the plastic bullets.  So what's missing?  A plot.  These elements strung randomly together do not make a western.  There needs to be a story and in this game, the player(s) have to be the writer.  If you wait for the game to reveal the story, it'll never happen.  Add in your own writing and you have the makings of a tall tale worth repeating.  The rating on this would likely go up if only an expansion that set a plot in motion were created.

A very thematic wild west showdown game.  You can fashion your character to be a hunter or a dueler and be successful at either.

The game has a lot of parts which I typically do not enjoy. However my kids got a kick out of it. Whether I hold on to it depends on how much fun I can have with them. I do enjoy the Old West theme and the game does a reasonable job of incorporating it. I like that you can choose to be an outlaw and attack other players.

Why didn't I rate this a "10"? This is a FUN, very thematic game. It very effectively immerses you in the middle of an old western. It's a blast to play and has tons of different "old west" things you can do. But while being fun and immersive, the gameplay isn't very challenging. And it can be repetitive and wandering, which is why it didn't earn a "10". But it got a "9" 'cause its so fun and innovative! Oh, did I mention that it's fun?

Fun adventure game with excellent theme.  I dig the mini games and managing the bullet bag.  It does feel more like a system or framework though, and I think it would benefit greatly from some more evocative expansion material.

I found some of the fun in the game to be gimmicky, like seeing how fast you can pull chits out of a bag, or diverting the flow of the game into a single-player mini-game to herd some cattle.  It added nice flavor, but at what cost?  It was fun and had some neat things happening, but I found the random objectives can really mess up your game if they don't play to your strengths - at least its apparent the revolver is much more powerful than the rifle.  Normally, the random bag pull wouldn't be my cup of tea - but it's handled nicely and the spurs can mitigate the luck enough that I had a good time managing what was in my bag and not feeling bogged down by it.  Overall, it was decent, but didn't blow my socks off or anything.

This is the ultimate game of the Old West! Some of the components are cheaply made, but this is a great game which recreates nearly everything about the Old West - no Indians or trains, but a train was added with the Legends expansion. Works great with 2 players, too.

We are all desperate for a good cowboy game, but this isn't it yet.

It is better than most in terms of being light and fun, but it has some issues.

The components are ok, and the pulling bullet chits out of a bag was ok, but I wouldn't do the "see who can pull them out fastest" - I think there was a varient we played where you didn't have to do that like a dexterity challenge.

The worst part was the horse breaking and cow rustling. You had to stop and watch one person do little sub games on a small hex grid that took 3 to 5 minutes each time. 

All in all, I would play this again if someone else owned it and liked it, but it is not one that I need to buy. 

I continue in my quest to find a good Ameritrash cowboy game with some flow to it and interesting decisions during the game.

sigh ...

Pretty fun game. 

There can be a bit of downtime, as there are a lot of things that a player can do on their turn, especially if they go to town. 

Components could be better, but using the new wooden dice that the game's owner just got was a lot better and more fun than the cardboard ones. 

I like that there are different ways to play and roles to play. Very thematic.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Less of a game than a sandbox. Gives you all you need to get the flavour of a spaghetti western, and enough of a framework to drive the action. When all is said and done though, it is just a matter of random pulls from a bag that you can mitigate the odds a little. As such, it's much more about what the players bring to the table. If you've got a group that can get into the theme and inhabit these characters, there's a ton of fun to be had. The duelling mechanism is a blast, and not capitalizing on taking down that wanted gunslinger is a big mistake. While there's no innovative mechanic here to be enamoured with, this game is tremendous fun, and nails the western theme better than any other game I've played.

In Spurs: A Tale in the Old West, players take on the role of adventurers in the Old West, competing to handle various challenges to become a true Legend of the West.

Players take turns moving around the main board, carrying out classic activities of the Old West, like taking on cattle-herding jobs or engaging in horse-breaking; if you are good at riding, you might end up with a nice stallion to sell! Gunslingers can go searching for wanted outlaws in the badlands or take on jobs to escort stagecoaches or deal with a gang of Desperados. Hunters will seek out wildlife in the forests (be careful as some animals might hunt you instead), while others might seek fortune by searching for gold in the mountains or gambling in the town saloons. Be careful, though, as you never know when other players will challenge you to a duel and try to rob you.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

We struggled through the rules slightly on our first play for some reason but figured out how to play fairly quickly. The mini-games for rounding up cattle and taming a bronco were odd but interesting. It is a race to a set number of points - I'd recommend 10 the first time. If played with more than 3 players, I could see significant downtime at spots in the game as a person completes their mini-game or action. Drawing bullets from the bag was a fun concept for the duels - although I'd avoid the fast draw rule where everyone is just pulling out bullets as fast as possible, that just makes the game frivolous even if it fits the theme. You'll laugh at the game board when you see it - pretty uninspired terrain board - wonder why they didn't go with modular terrain and allow different terrain setups. I'd play again, but I don't expect I'll ever own it.

The game was mildly amusing on my one and only play, but that was only because we couldn't stop laughing at how bad the game is. 

This is barely a game at all. Roll dice, make a barely meaningful decision.  Rinse and repeat. 

The components are pretty lousy too, the artwork is a bore, especially the map which is plain ugly. 

All in all, I had a good time playing a partial game, but would never play this mess again.

I feel there's a lot of freedom and the theme comes across very well.  I don't really care for the "Suburbia" tie rule, and I don't really care for the dexterity element in the dueling. I think I'd prefer playing with the turn-based variant rules for dueling.

The point bonuses awarded at the end seem like a slippery slope.  Most Money will probably go to someone who was already doing well; Most Bullets will go to someone who happened to be doing well at the time extra bullets happened to be in the shop.

It's red dead redemption in board game form.  Who couldn't enjoy this?  It does have its quirks, but I have also kickstarted the wooden bullets expansion and can't wait to incorporate this into the game.  It will make the duels feel more filled with tension and excitement.

Edit: I received the wooden bullets (mullets) and it REALLY adds to the enjoyment/excitement of duels.

I've really enjoyed playing this game, and it has seen my table a number of times.    I think the idea of playing mini games, and the mixture of deck building mechanic and dexterity in the shooting rounds are fun.  The instruction manual is absolutely horrendous however, and the many erratas out there actually contradict the main manual so who knows which is right.

Really fun. I'm not really a fan of some of the components (wooden bullets would have been so, so great...).

One more thing I can't really understand: I understand making an expansion like The Gambler in which you add a 6 player. I have a hard time understanding why the base game comes with no 2 player variant; instead you must buy the expansion for the rules?

So easy to see a 2 player game in the base box...

This game does give you a flavor of the old west better than some other games with a western theme.  However, the game is a bit slow.  There are some fun things I like about the game and others such as breaking a horse that are just not fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Somehow they made an ultra thematic cowboy game with cattle rustling, bank robbing, outlaw hunting, and player dueling, all without weighing the game down with too many rules. In fact, Spurs feels like a very light romp through the old west. Even when you're shooting at the other players and stealing their goods, it never feels cutthroat. At times, this is both Spurs greatest strength and greatest weakness.
Sometimes it feels like there isn't enough weight behind each challenge, with money and victory points flowing freely and punishment for failure being very light. Many of the actions rely on the same basic mechanic of drawing random bullet tokens and playing the odds. Surprisingly, one of the most fun challenges, in my opinion, comes in the form of breaking wild horses using a separate hex board.
In the end, Spurs is a very enjoyable game when played in a casual setting, and best when seen in the big picture and not examined under the microscope. Unique enough to have earned a spot in my collection, and probably one of the best cowboy games I've played, even if it wasn't as rough and rowdy as I expected.

This is a game that perhaps is a little week in replayability - but I have brought it to multiple groups and small cons and those who play it for the first time really get into it and it have a great time...and I enjoy running it (with a few tweaked rules).

I thought this was really fun and the theme was really good for what really boils down to a VP scoring Euro.

I REALLY liked the meta games of wrangling cows and taming the horses - that aspect was my favorite part.  

I thought the blind draw actions were ok (blind draws aren't my favorite mechanic) but what didn't really work for me was the duel action.  I like what they tried to do - just not my thing (racing for the proper bullets in your bag).

A very thematic game with many good ideas and a fun dueling mechanism. It's a good game if played in the right group that roleplays it up. Played in the wrong group this game can fall flat.

The components could have been better and I wished that it played at little faster (I think I am going to avoid 5 player gamesfrom now on). 

The game has a very good Bullet mechanism that I wish would be used in a more streamlined game.

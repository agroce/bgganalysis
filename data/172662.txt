RATING: 5
1st play: Meh, not sure what was going on with this, maybe I didn't see enough cards, but the game is essentially play a card, draw a card, and the cards themselves don't really do a whole lot except play another card or draw another card.  Maybe there was more to it, but I don't think so.

No 2nd play.

I'm not sure how much I actually like this... Not a bad game, I'm just not sure it's an interesting game.

Much better the second and third time through. There is alot to this game that doesn't come through the first time. Stick with it and you'll enjoy it!

Own it, got on Kickstarter.  The idea and the artwork are great.  Sometime is off on the mechanics.  It's like you really only have control in the last phase of the game, so everything else is fluff.

SOLD IT!

Chaotic gameplay that somehow lures you in with it's fast play. The rulebook is very vague and only makes sense after you start playing and many unanswered rules will come up. These problems knock the game down from a 6 rating. All that aside, the game looks quite nice on the table.

Played the game with three once and found it way too chaotic to make any meaningful decisions. Imagine even worse at four.

Surprisingly better than expected.  After your first play you'd think it's all luck and randomness, but with more plays you find ways to mitigate the luck somewhat, and have a tense finish.  Perfect considering that it plays in under 15 minutes.

Entretenido filler que consiste, principalmente, en combar cartas. Bastante azar, pero también puteo, faroleo, y control. Muy evidente en un principio, pero con más opciones de las que parece, conforme vas profundizando en él.

* Kickstarted! *

Decent quick-paced card games where you play down types until one of the columns of them reaches 7... and then the cards in your hands are totalled up for point value to win.

PLUS: easy to learn, fast paced
MINUS: rules aren't fully clear

RATING: 7.1
Seven7s is a pretty interesting game.  I like how it's a deck of 49 cards, 7 cards of 7 suits and 7 numbers each.  I like how each of the suits has a special power that's unique and can changed the game.  What I don't like is the "Ages of Man" card.  It's a clever card though and can push the game along well however, we had a player who constantly played them in their own column, which kept taking out the high cards.  While most games tend to end in the low to mid tens, we had a game end with 5 being the high score.  He single-handedly broke the game.  Other than that, pretty cool little game.

This game reminds me of Killer Bunnies. In that all the card play that you've done during the game means nothing. The only thing that matters for scoring is a couple of cards in your hand at the games end. 

Can I have my 20 minutes back?

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I had largely ignored this one until 2017 but found it engaging and interesting. Of course, we played with a few house rules from what I understand which I think I prefer. Cards are played to their specific type of pile in most cases which allow a special action to be taken. Everyone will potentially score the three cards in their hand at the end of the game although there are some ways to influence what will score, ideally more in your favor.

Filler car d game with 7 colors, numbers and powers.  The object is to score cards in hand at the end.  However they do not score if the certain card shave been played.  There is some interesting card play here in that all the special abilities of the cards have competing powers.  Watching what your opponents do provide clues as to there cards.  However it is a card game and there is a bit of luck.  

Not an offensive game but I have liked other fillers better.  A little boring to me but I could be persuaded to play again.  My opinion may change after more plays.

The first half or more of the game seems pointless as you have no idea what colour will score or what numbers will be eligible to score. And the effects also seem pointless, shuffling around cards of unknown value. As you get closer to the end, it gets a bit less murky and interest grows in what you keep (rather than just idly tossing out cards), but the game can still turn on the final plays, changing what colour scores and what values score. Making for a rather pointless pastime climaxed by a rather random ending. There might well be more to it, but an encouraging first play it was not.

Seven7s is a short card game in which players play cards of seven different suits and 7 different numerical values to a central display.  Each suit has a different power--for example, Holy Virtues lets you draw and play another card, Seas lets you take a card from the display, and Wonders lets you rearrange the top of the deck.  The game ends when the stack for any display reaches 7, and then the player with the highest value of hand cards wins.  The lynchpin here, though, is the Ages of Man suit--for each card in this stack in the display, the highest-value cards don't count for scoring.  Overall, this game has some nice ideas in it and feels pretty unique. I think the game it's closest to is Red7, though it is more involved. The outcomes are pretty random, but I enjoyed the process.

It simply lacks someting. The concept is interesting and I was curious at first, but after some plays there's nothing more I can discover in it. The game is not bad and will surely find its fans, but in my opinion, there are many better games in its category.

Ages of Man and Colours cards continuously affect the game state.

Interesting hand management game with a bunch of special (easy to understand) powers you use to optimize value of your hand at the end of the game. Plays quickly with some things to think about, but not get bogged down by. Something about the rules presentation, however, made it harder to learn than it should have been! I much prefer my summary, below.

Nice filler!

Really enjoyable card game.  There is a lot going on here and that makes it fun.  Your hand consists of three cards how easy is that?  There is strategy involved as to which card to play to benefit you and hinder your apponent. It's easy to learn, quick to play and super fun.

Seven7s is a light filler with the barest hint of theme. There's something going on about using the power of the greatest 7's in history? So you've got a suit called Wonders (each of which is one of the seven wonders of the world), another for the seven Seas, the seven deadly Sins, and another four suits (for a total of seven suits) where they were really stretching to find a suit that contained seven somethings. I have a hard time remembering what they were to be honest.

Each suit has seven cards numbered 1 through 7. And every card in the suit has a different color (which isn't tied to number). You have three cards in your hand. You play one, do it's power and draw a replacement. Cards are played (generally) to a pile of that type of card on the board (starting a new pile if that type isn't out yet). When any pile has 7 cards on it, then the game ends. At the end of the game you score points for the value of the cards in your hand... kinda.

Each suit has a special power. Two suits can be played on any pile, but impact end of game scoring if they're played to their own piles. The Ages of Man (ha, I did remember it) cards knock out the highest numbered cards... so if there are three in that pile at game end then the three highest numbers (7, 6 and 5) don't score points. Unless of course the Colors card pile matches the color on the card. At game end, whichever color card is topmost in the color column becomes the wild color and any card of that color scores whatever highest value number is still in play. The other suits let you take another turn, look at the draw deck and reorder them, take a card off one of the piles on the board, force an opponent to randomly discard a card to the board or guess the top card off the deck for 2 points.

The game is a little random as which cards will score changes a lot during the game... but given that this is a very quick filler, the amount of random isn't a problem. Things get a little thinkier towards the end of the game, but there's definitely some luck and randomness going on. It was cute and fun.

The rules to this game weren't great. I couldn't quite grasp the gameplay from the written rules... although after watching a video on how to play online it was fairly straightforward. There are a number of concepts, like the order of operations on drawing replacement cards, and what happens to some cards (when you guess the top card of the deck and it's wrong do you discard it or take it into hand?) that weren't explained and are ambiguous. The rules, which are fairly brief, could have used some help.

Fun filler that grows in you after a couple of rounds as you get familiar with all the cards into play. The wild colour option is really great as it unlocks other columns' powers and thus making it less predictable for which column gets off first. Having any strategy is quite hard and the last turn always surprises you. Recommend it.

I have no idea what to think about this one. I've played it once with 4 players and all I know is this: I played a card game and stuff happened. I don't know if the game is all about smart planning or random chance. I would have to play it again to form a final opinion, but I don't know if I really want to.

A quick game, not overly taxing on one's mind or emotions.  Fun to play with kids, and interesting ways of manipulating the game to either extend it or shut it down.  Some degree of luck with the cards, yet the game is designed to try to mitigate luck by the fluid nature of the ever-changing columns of cards.

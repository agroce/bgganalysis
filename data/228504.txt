11/6/17 - Now up to 7 plays despite owning this game only two weeks. People keep on asking me to bring it & keep on wanting to play it. I think it's the marriage of really elegant easy-to-teach mechanics with a really entertaining theme that makes it so good. The only thing that keeps it from being a 10 is that in my opinion, it could use more stray cats and some optional 'modules' to add in to spice things up. Like maybe some kind of cat show module, or some complex cats for more experienced players, or more things to collect. Basically, I love the game, but I already want expansions!

10/30/17 - Having a lot of fun with this one. It seemed like such a relaxed, simple set-collection when I first bought it, but it's actually shockingly cutthroat with brutal blocking, constant hilarious cat puns, and endless accusations of opponents being bad cat ladies. Each time you play, the cat tableau you have turns out completely different. One opponent won by having almost no fed cats but having a ton of toys and costumes. Or you can win by hoarding food and feeding a ton of cats. Or you can win by abusing certain powerful stray cats... as long as your opponents don't block you. And they will. They will block you ruthlessly, especially if they wanted the cat you snuck out from right under their nose. I love how fast it plays and just how FUN it is. The stray  cats also completely change the game strategies available, so they really help replayability.  I hope expansions get released for this one.

I avoid giving 10s often, especially on things we publish. It seems slimy, and honestly I can nitpick our own work like crazy. But this game is just plain fun. Everyone I've played it with loves it.  It's excellent and everyone should try it.

Played this cute filler today and it was pretty great ... right up until we started trying to count up the score. Have to knock a few points off for not providing an itemized scorepad for a game with a ridiculous number of things to add up, particularly in relation to the game's lack of complexity.

For a filler, this is really fun. This might actually be my favorite filler of all time (although Biblios might have something to say about that). Is it a sushi go killer? No it is not, especially when you're looking at Sushi Go Party. But it's just pure quick, simple, fun even with 2 people.

I got to play this at AEG's Big Game Night at GenCon 2017 and enjoyed it quite a bit. I was pleasantly surprised to find it in the games bundle we all left with. I gifted this to my sister because I knew she would enjoy it, and I could borrow it whenever I wanted. (she doesn't buy games herself) It's lighter than some set collection games but it is easy to catch on and plays smoothly and quickly.

I have had the game since Gencon 2017.  I tend to like medium to medium heavy games.  I tend not to like light games.  I also do not like cats.  I purchased Cat Lady for my wife, and we tried the the game out the night after my return from Grencon. To my surprise, we both loved the game. I have played it maybe ten times, and I still love it.  

The game lasts about twenty minutes and is great with all player counts.  There are many different paths to victory.  The art is fun and subtlety funny, meaning it does not have that "laugh once but obnoxious later" quality.  When playing, I do feel like a crazy cat lady who is collecting cats and cat paraphernalia.  As such, the theme is integrated and enjoyable.  This amazes me as, again, I do not like cats.  Most of all, I feel like I am making meaningful decisions the whole game.  This is because the game presents the player with several good decisions to make almost every turn.  This is in contrast to other light games where the best decision is apparent almost every turn.  This said, Cat Lady is very easy to teach and set up.  I have taught the game and set it up in five minutes.

This is the best light game I have played in years.  I dare say that it belongs in most collections.

This game is the perfect level for filler. It's easy to teach—in just a couple of minutes—and the game play is straight forward. Add to that the quirky artwork, having to feed your cats and collecting toys, cat nip, spray bottles and stray cats—how can you go wrong. Adorable.

As 30-minute fillers go, there's a real game in here. It has about as many decision points and as much player interaction (without the use of "take that" cards) as could reasonably be expected to exist in a game so quick and simple.

The game is simple enough to learn only a few turns in. This is perfect as a filler game, or as an introduction to drafting games for new players. Since the majority of the cards you draft simply count as points, the game goes by pretty quickly. There are some instances where a more advanced player may wish for some additional complexity, but that would go against the light-hearted theme and fast pace of the game.

[b]The theme:[/b] I love cats. And this game has plenty of them. You collect toys for them, you have to feed them (but if you buy too much food, it goes bad at the end of the game), plus you can get extra points for catnip and cat-costumes. Oh, such a fun theme!

[b]The components:[/b] The artwork is very nice and consistent. The cards are high quality and I love the cat meeple! I don't like the boring food cubes - why couldn't they put some nice food meeples in? :(

[b]The fun:[/b] If you like cats, the game is so much fun! If you absolutely hate them, you probably won't like the game. The best thign is, the game moves so fast, you have no time to be bored!

[b]The gameplay:[/b] The game is basically just drafting 3 cards out of a 3x3 matrix. Replace them and repeat :) But is it something bad? Not at all! It doesn't try to seem like something it isn't. It is just a great filler-ish game.

Graphismes gentillets pour un petit jeu de cartes où on est une femme à chats. Il faut essayer de récolter un max de chats et de nourriture pour leur filer à manger. Seuls les chats nourris rapportent des points à la fin. Le jeu fonctionne en posant des cartes face visible en une grille de 4x4. A son tour, un joueur ramasse une rangée complète pour l'ajouter à sa pile de score. Celle-ci est immédiatement remplacée et le joueur suivant ne peut pas prendre la même rangée. Une fois le deck fini, on compte les points. C'est gentillet, pas trop moche, assez simple mais, franchement, le prix est abusé.

A charming game that offers more gameplay than one would assume based on its title and theme. It's quick, plays well at all counts, and is easy to teach and learn. Best of all, it's fun! We can't always say that about gateway games.

Cat Lady is quite a good little game. It doesn't need an expansion, but if it gets one, I can definitely see myself bumping up its score.

I love the concept, the artwork, and the easy rules so you can pick the game up and teach the game to pretty much anyone very quickly. I do find the game to be very luck based and everyone usually ends up with a very close score so there is not much strategy. It is a quick and fun short game though if you love cats.

I like the cat theme but as far as mechanics, I'd rather play Sushi Go or 7 wonders. As a filler game I appreciate that Sushi Go is card-only, while as a thinkier game I'd prefer something meatier. In both cases I prefer the simultaneous draft to serialized.

Initial impressions of this are very positive from a family gaming perspective.

2018-02-12 - This is a decent drafting game. I've heard people say it replaces Sushi Go! for them, and I could maybe see that, but I think the variety that Sushi Go! Party adds elevates that game above this one. The theme of this game is great, though, and it's fun on its own.

Can you really ever have too many fillers?  Definitely not, if they have cats in them! 

A light drafting game that offers a slightly different drafting mechanism - cards are placed in a grid and you take a row or a column, but one row/column is off limits.  Requires you to balance taking what you need and maybe getting stuck with something you didn't necessarily need/want, which will require you to adapt your strategy on future rounds.  The decisions aren't particularly difficult to make so this is a breezy game to play while holding a conversation.

You could honestly play this with just about anybody since the gameplay is very straightforward.  A little bit of set collection with a little bit of angst on how to feed all of your cats.

Tons of jokes can be made while playing the game, as well!  Adorable cat names!

Simple but solid drafting and set collection fun. Plays lightning fast. The art and the theme are perfectly implemented, which combined with its simplicity makes it a good choice for non-gamers, particularly those who love cats. It's not boring for gamers though - there are sometimes interesting decisions about when to push your luck and grab a cat you can't feed yet or when to cut another player off from what they need.

"This is a really fun and quick, card drafting/set collection game.  The cards have clean looking art, pleasant colors, and are made out of a nice material - almost plastic-like. Instructions are well written.  Not very hard to learn; complexity is sub 2.  Would be a great game to introduce to beginners, cat lovers, or people who want something fun and light."

Cats and card drafting, what else could a boy ask for?  This game is delightfully silly as you collect cats, food, toys, costumes and other cat paraphernalia.  However, there is an actual game here too.  A different mix of stray cats each game make subtle tweaks that may move the dominant strategy for a particular games and the spray bottle gives you some tactical choices of when to block your opponent.

This games gives Sushi Go a run for it's money as a light, easy, accessible and fun card drafting game.  As a bonus, it's one of the few games that my partner will actually request and it's one of the rare card drafting games that actually works with 2 players.  

My only gripe is that I wish there was more variety and attention to detail in the artwork.  It would be great if each cat has a unique character to match its quirky name.

A quirky lightweight drafting variant.  It's got a silly theme and it's quick to teach, but there's some actual strategic depth here.  The only real question is "Does this fill a niche that Sushi Go does not" and I'm not sure on that - but I think it might.

The only real downside is the need to constantly deal out new cards to refill the board which actually takes almost as much time as the game play itself.

We have a winner! This is the light set collection game we've been looking for. This won over Archaeology and Coloretto for us.

Go find your cats and try to feed all of them. Cat Lady is cute and light card game of a minor cross between Sushi Go's set-collection and Coloretto's card-selection, a purr-fect marriage. Point penalties occur at the end-game if you can't feed all your cats, if you have the most unused food, if you don't have at least 1 cat costume, and ,if you dabbled in catnip, if you don't have at least 2 bags. Very good 2 player.

Art (by game designer) and graphic design is on the simpler and lighter side, but perhaps that will cause appeal to a wider audience. I can see how this game will be instantly a good family game, church group game, and casual game. With some rules clarifications and a scoring aid, this game could be a hit in superstores, including crafts stores.

This is a very cool filler game. This has a similar weight to Sushi Go!, which it is getting compared to a lot. I can see that when it comes to some of the set collection cards (toys, costumes, catnip). However, I really feel like the main part of the game is in getting and feeding your cats and that has a much different feel to me. I really enjoyed trying to balance everything out and trying not to get too much food, but still have enough to feel all my cats. Every game I've played so far was very close and we already had it come down to the tie breaker. It's a cute theme and the components are great. I like the cubes to represent the cubes to make it easier to track. The drafting a row or column (not the same as the last one chosen) from a 3 X 3 card grid worked really well. The pray bottles allow you to break those rules and possibly block your opponent. I wouldn't use this to replace Sushi Go!. They have an overall different feel to me and Sushi Go! is able to handle the larger player counts. I'm planning on keeping them both. Fun!

A friend brought this over. My mind immediately put this in the same category as Exploding Kittens, a game I am not fond of. I like trying new games though, so I didn't mind giving it a go.

Not a big cat person, in fact I usually find them fairly annoying, but this game is anything but that. Nice light game with some interesting decisions going on. Nothing too amazing or shocking, and everything is pretty simple and straightforward, but it still works and is a fun filler. Wish it was just slightly longer and had a bit more variable scoring cats. Maybe special power cards too or something else to mix it up just a bit more. Still, for a base game and for something quick it is very fun and enjoyable.

I bought this as a 2017 xmas gift for Emma from our cat, Twinkle. Want to play it soon.....

Played twice - a fun little game. Easy to play but with meaningful (albeit somewhat limited) choices. The theme is very cute and the artwork is a puuurfect (sorry) match for the tone and light weight of the game. Scoring is quite fiddly - but this doesn't spoil things. It is also difficult to tell who is in the lead so the final tally is actually quite exciting! Feels like a keeper. Will see how often it gets requested....

RATING: 6
tl;dr: very light and forgettable, but enjoyable

Cat ladies get as many cats as possible. So that's what you do in this game. Of course cats need to eat, so you also get food. Just having players grab cats and food, so some special cards are added to spice things up. This allows players to try scoring in a few different ways, especially with the stray cats. It's all quite nice and easy. It's quite enjoyable. It's also quite forgettable. But if you have a copy, I'm sure you'll play it a couple of times. But don't expect me to invest in a copy for myself.

[thing=228504][/thing] is a set collection game that is quite easy to teach and to play. And when I say quick, I mean it: a play takes around 15 minutes! The game is about taking cards in order to get the best score at the end - several cards give points: cats, costumes, catnip, toys, but most of these come with another task: you need to feed the cats, otherwise they will give you negative points; only one catnip and you lose points; only the person with the most costumes gains points, but you need at least one to lose points; toys are just great, however, and the more, the merrier. With this, the mechanics keep you interested in all your plays, since you are always after something.

The art is excellent and sets a great mood for the game; while the mechanics make a good job in creating a fun enviroment, with decisions and also manages to have some proper theme. The way when a row/collumn is blocked once it is taken is highly smooth and elegant way to lower the effect of the luck of the draw, since the new cards coming, even if all are great, can't be taken directly by the next person. Sure, there is also quite a bit of luck in the game, but for the most part, I consider that my decisions were building my tableau. The scoring has some similarities with Sushi Go, but otherwise they are both very different games.

[thing=228504][/thing] gets a recommendation as a very good filler - it is clever and requires constant choices (albeit often easy ones) to be made by the players, while providing a fine amount of interaction, with basically no agression, since even trying to take food from others, can lead to a penalty at the end game scoring. Harmless, smart and cute. Approved.

This rating is based on 2 player experience only. Very fast and fun filler game. My wife loves cats so this was an instant hit. There is only couple of rules but you can still find a lot of strategy if you think ahead.

A bog-standard set collection game. The only potentially interesting bit is the card-selection mechanism, but it's not really that interesting in practice. The theme is cute and gets it an extra point or so.

Reminded me of Sushi Go! and it was fun to play. Not to be taken too serious obviously. Artwork is cute but unfortunately no unique cat-drawings for every outfit.

With dogs this game could have been so much better ;)

Positive:

Neutral:
- A simple set collection game

Negative:
- 20 euro at Spiel 2017) is a high price tag for this type of game

A very fun set collection/drafting game. I'm not a fan of drafting games typically (7 Wonders is one of my least favorite games ever), but this changes the formula up to make it interesting and fun by drafting from the same grid everyone else can see.

[b]1st session, 2 plays, 2p:[/b]

It's a pretty nifty line drafting card game with great artwork that plays quickly. A great complement to Sushi Go!, although it's probably lighter. Cow might be overpowered. Looking forward to playing with 3p+.

Verdict: [b]7.5[/b]

Why is this game so underrated?

Sure it's flawed, sure it's messy, yes its rulebook was chucked together by a blind editorphobe but it has a lot going for it:

1. It is pure theme. So many actions and rules exist purely because they just damn should. This is a good thing.
2. You do feel like you're in the part of a corporation owning superpower sending your agents to make the most of opportunities.
3. There's so much variety you'll never get bored.

Best advice - get a teacher who is enthusiastic and knows the game inside out to teach you. I.E. Me.

En general los valores de producción de este juego son muy bajos. Los dibujos de las cartas (feúchos), el diseño del tablero (oscuro y confuso), los marcadores (impresos por un lado y completamente blancos por el otro), los peones (de material raruno, parecen caramelos)... todo tiene un estilo de bajo presupuesto que echa para atrás.

Luego está el reglamento. Es confuso, lleno de tablas y plagado de excepciones. Durante las primeras partidas te pasas más tiempo releyéndote el reglamento que jugando.

Las cartas no tienen texto escrito sino que tienen iconos que representan diferentes habilidades. La idea es buena pero luego resulta que las cartas tienen ciertas habilidades únicas que solo vienen descritas en el reglamento! Como al principio no sabes que cartas tienen alguna excepción; cada vez que aparece una nueva acabas mirándote el manual para ver si, a parte de los iconos, tiene alguna habilidad específica. Algo tedioso y que ralentiza mucho las primeras partidas.

Si eres capaz de pasar por alto todas esas pegas estarás ante un juego bastante completo, con muchas opciones disponibles y con todo lo necesario para pasar una tarde muy entretenida. Recomendaría este juego para grupos de 4 o más jugadores. Con menos jugadores algunas de las mecánicas pierden la gracia y se hace menos interesante.

Como apunte adicional, requiere de una mesa bastante grande para poder jugar cómodamente.

Tengo que reconocer que en un principio me pareció un buen juego. Con mucho chrome y detalle por detrás que me ofrecían una profundidad totalmente desconocida en este tipo de mecánica (colocación de meeples).

Desgraciadamente esa virtud al final se convierte en su mayor defecto, pq el juego es inmanejable y se va de las manos con tanta carta, icono y aleatoriedad.

Realmente se convierte en un caos con poca posibilidad de establecer estrategias a medio plazo. El tema de los iconos es realmente de locos y te obliga a consultas frecuentes de reglas que hacen el juego poco ágil.

Una pena, pq se ve que realmente lleva un trabajo de diseño importante detrás.

Many good ideas and quite interesting scenario. Sadly, the overall well made reference sheet has many errors or at least dosent provide all the infos needed. Some mechanics like seduce are much too strong and too random.

I'm horribly conflicted on this game.  On one hand, the theme is great and the mechanics "appear" simple.  On the other, it's an extremely long game without a cohesive strategy (don't go all scientists, just go all ALL).  And the symbology. The game tries to look simple by hiding behind tons and tons of symbols that require constantly referencing the rulebook.

I CAN see how repeated plays can address many of my complaints.  I'm sure a refined strategy will emerge once people know what they're doing.  I'm sure the symbols won't appear cryptic after you memorize each one.  In the meantime, whoa, what a learning curve.  Who has the time to devote eight hours to a game before knowing that it's fun?

I fully expect to update this comment after another four hour play through.

RATING: 6
Rating based on one play (5-player).  Wasn't sure to expect, since I had heard such conflicting reports about the game that I wasn't sure that people were all talking about the same game.  After my first play, I'm still not entirely sure what to think, but the game definitely seemed to go on too long.  Part of the problem was confusion about several key rules (in general, not just for me).  I think if all players were ready to place workers on their turn then it should be a quick, decent little game, but AP of any magnitude can grind this game to a complete halt.

What a fucking mess! 

Each player needs their own little booklet to explain locations and icons.
Trying to assess a cohesive strategy, when faced with such symbolism,
is just beyond my desires.

Mecanisburgo is the boardgaming equivalent of a cult movie - not many people have played it, due to its rather high price and limited availability (likely its vaunted complexity also has something to do with that).  Those who have played it, though, know that this is one unique game that, even if they don't love it, fills a niche.  

Basically, this is worker placement, but what makes it different is that each worker is an individual character, with abilities and frailties all their own.  This is a big innovation in worker placement as far as I'm concerned, as normally workers are simply placeholders and have no real individual powers.  Set in a somewhat dystopian future, you deploy your workers to the board in the hopes of making your corporation the most laden with VPs.  How does this happen?  Well, you can collect valuable assets (both characters and buildings) who in turn can help you complete major projects or defeat threats.  You can make money.  And you can do many, many bad things to your competition.  

Yes, there are a million and one icons to learn in this game, but once you have played a game or two, it is really quite straightforward.  Yes, this basically a Euro with the biggest, shaggiest VP mechanism I've seen.  And yes, in one sense, the theme is pasted on.  Since so many out there are die-hard cyberpunk fans, this might be problematic, as there are no back stories or "flavor" attached to many of the characters.  For me, though, this is a bonus.  I've found that often it is the games that are more abstracted that actually let me enter into the theme better, as they provide a bare bones on which I can hang my own narrative.  And let me be clear - the game's mechanisms are VERY thematic.  The interactions and outcomes favor creating a very memorable narrative of your own making.  This is key for me - a game can be sketchy on the theme front in all the "flavor" areas, as long as the play itself suits the theme and makes the outcomes sensible.  And Mecanisburgo has that in spades.

So, if you like cyberpunk or worker placement, this is a good one.  I don't even like cyberpunk much, and I love this game.  I don't know as I'd pay $80 for it, but it's definitely worth $40-50 (I got mine on Amazon for $41 shipped).  This is one sleeper worth waking up to.

There's a lot to get through here to actually get at the game.  What's underneath isn't that bad, but I think there's just too much randomness involved for me to really love it.

RATING: 3
God, what a mess. I actually moderately enjoyed my one play, in a masochistic kind of way, because it's possible to see through the disaster of over-chroming the clever and interesting game at the heart of the storm. There are some good twists on the Aladdin's Dragons core engine here, but this thing is just so completely weighed down with chrome, it doesn't move. More in this case is just more. There are so many abilities and so many modifiers that it's impossible for them to work in any coherent way. Maybe you get a set of skills and modifiers you can work with and that cohere thematically and work as a game, but given the huge proliferation of attributes, by far the far more likely outcome is an incoherent splattering.

Rip a third of this game out, and give it a clear and comprehensible rulebook, and this is a very clever, nicely thematic, and engaging game. But is it is, it's totally not any of those things. It's just a train wreck of ideas and icons and symbols and poor communication design.

I have written a [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/366022]full review[/url]; refer to that for more information. It's based on a single game in which we got some rules wrong, but I can't see myself ever playing this again, and I thought some explanation as to why would be helpful.

To give a short summary, though, this is a game that is much more appealing on paper than it is in practice. It really needed an editor, as the designers seem to have taken a "kitchen sink" approach, adding in every mechanic and concept they could think. The end result is that the relatively simple and promising core elements transform into a bloated, fiddly, overly long, and chaotic mess. There are simply too many moving parts, too many random elements, too many unpredictable special powers, and too much information to consider to allow for any true strategy. The horrid graphic design, with an iconography so complex it begins to resemble hieroglyphics, doesn't help. The sci-fi theme is pretty much the only interesting element here, but that is hardly evocative enough for me to recommend anyone suffering through this overwrought disaster.

Incredibly detailed worker placement game. Some poor translations in the rules and an iconography set that would make a map maker blind himself, but in the end there's a lot to like if you can get to the actual game. Oh, and probably too many victory conditions, but if you can even track what you're supposed to be doing for the *default* VP, I'm impressed. Hoping to try this out at the 2010 Fall Retreat my game group holds every year.

Really enjoying this one, does a lot of things I like well, multiple paths to victory, unpredicatability, very different experience from game to game, asymetric powers.

Seems ridiculously complex at first but gets pretty smooth after a learning game.

Fantastic blend of theme, as the game generates it's own narrative as it progresses, combined with a meaty and interesting game engine. SUPERB!

RATING: 5.5
Mechanisburgo is a medium-conflict, high-complexity card game with a "secret worker placement" sort of element. (Opponents can see that you placed a worker, but don't know which worker until the area is resolved.)

The rules are complicated and the rulebook is poorly organized and translated. It took us three attempts to actually fully understand everything necessary to play. 

And, in the end, it's not worth the effort. The game is just too complicated for its own good. The number of things which need to be continually added and then re-added is pretty extreme... and the combinations of icons-upon-icons is dramatically beyond something like Race for the Galaxy. (And I like Race for the Galaxy--even the icons!)

Sure, there are billions of different combinations and chains of skills, professions, ships, items, etc., but simply figuring out what options you might possibly try to *do* is a fairly daunting task. By the beginning of turn 2 you'll probably have around 13 different active cards, each with about 3-4 possible different uses. Some can be used in combination with others... and then you have to decide how to parcel out these card/workers to the worker placement conflict areas on the board and then interact with what everyone else is doing. Too much.

There are also some redundant icons and icons used inconsistently, adding to the complexity and confusion.

My game group thinks that if this was the only game you had and you were able to play it again and again and again, it might be a fairly good game... but we won't be playing it like that, to be sure.

EDIT: A couple days after writing the above, I got to play Glory to Rome for the first time. Even though both games have intricate cardplay, Glory to Rome is elegant and clever, with smooth-flowing mechanics. Sort of the exact polar opposite of Mecanisburgo.

RATING: N/A
I had a blast playing this game. 

The barrier to entry is pretty high, due to translation issues and just tons of minor things that need to be figured out and explained. We lost some players, due to this, but once we overcame these obstacles, we found a very creative and fun game. 

The decision-making possibilities are endless, because there are so many different characters and abilities, as well as different ways to resolve each encounter. These are the core elements of this design, in my opinion and these same qualities are what draw me to this title. The diverse paths to victory are a bonus.

Heed the warning, though, that this game is not for everyone, because you have to keep track of a huge number of different symbols that describe your card abilities, but there is a cheat sheet to aid in this task. Oh and the art leaves a lot to be desired, but hey, we're gamers, not artists, right?

I am really glad I purchased the game and I can't wait to play again. Whether you and your gaming group will like it, will depend on what you value and what frustrates you.

After one game I must say the iconography overwhelmed me. If you think Race for the Galaxy is bad you haven't seen nothing yet. Despite this you do understand what it all means after a while and then it's actually a quite fun and interesting game unlike any other. Ok, there's worker placement but you can fight each others in different way and there's other interactions too.

I like it but can't give it a higher rating until I see if the iconography gets understandable. :)

The rules are a mess too, we could really have used a FAQ.

An interesting theme, usually treated with a more straightforward mechanic. Here, the mechanism is somewhat reminiscent of Alladin's Dragons, but with much more chaos and a longer playing time. It's really hard to control (at least with 5 players) and there is quite a bit of downtime during resolution. Needs to be played lightly to be enjoyed. Fun mostly comes from the theme and the large number of cards.

If players can get a handle on the mechanics and symbols, there is great potential for some interesting storytelling as the game progresses.  There is an intriguing cast of characters.  However, the wrong players can get stuck in the murk of optimizing their "worker placement".  If you can focus on the story, this is a lot of fun.

Crazy and long, but really cool. Does very interesting things with worker-placement. This is, essentially, a souped-up version of Leonardo da Vinci, which is a very good game hobbled by strange planning issues and a cumbersome setup. Mecanisburgo is more lenient in its projects setup (no random order and looser requirements) and just generally awesomer.
Warning: the rules are a mess. The iconography is not as daunting as you might think, because you only interact with a subset of them during any given game--but the rules are badly translated and badly organized.

I feel like a game's mechanics should be just as fun and appealing as its theme. This game was sooooooo longggggggg and torturous because I found neither the mechanics or the theme engaging. You place workers and are in competition for spaces that other players can place their workers in, as well. The other players seemed to enjoy it because they could tell their own little stories about their own player board and characters, but to me the mechanics and the theme were just annoying. If it had been a more engaging theme, say, ancient Rome, then maybe I would have loved the game, but I'll never know because I will never play it again in its current format.

The rules definitely need a few more revisions, since they leave out basic gameplay situations (e.g. how to resolve robodummies), have incorrect examples (e.g. not counting elite guts in threat resolution), are sometimes questionably organized (e.g. setup rules for games with less than 4 players are in the reference appendix), and are full of grammatical errors.  Also, the iconography on the cards often do not reflect their actual abilities (e.g. Android Magnus).

All that being said, I have enjoyed playing this and look forward to playing again.  Random, chaotic, tense, lots of neat card abilities, and fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a really ambitious game.  It asks the players to triangulate MANY interactions among different special powers, manage an economy, navigate several possible "sudden death" scenarios, plan on (or negotiate) the actions of other players, and keep track of a complex bidding and management operation, all while trying to deal with the luck of the draw.  Does it try to do too much?  Possibly.  The science fiction universe it evokes seems to be valued above any other aspect of the game, and indeed, it rewards you with very strange and rather dramatic situations for hanging in and trying to achieve everything mentioned above.  Is there an audience for a highly thematic, sprawlingly complex, four hour long game with combat and economic aspects?  Well, maybe not.  But I was intrigued.

There are a couple downsides--downtime is pretty high, though if you somehow managed to get to know the game well, it would certainly go down (the question is whether it is possible to get to know the game that well).  And, it is difficult for a player who gets behind to come back, though such a player may achieve victory in one of the sudden-death scenarios. I'm not sure how I feel about that last part.  

But if you are interested in knowing more, having more options... you might like it. I do.  At least, I think I do.  I admire its ambition and I think that it succeeds well it being what it wants to be.  Too bad what it wants to be is something so few people are looking for. (1 play)

Possibly the most difficult boardgame I have ever played.

Game mechanics and icons are piled up in a spaceship crash of debris; Early choices twist and tangle with the current turn; Future planning requires guesswork of what everyone else might do plus allowing for random elements; And then cards may or may not change the victory conditions to let you win on the next move.

I dislike the board - Why not a simple line of spaces to lay out the cards?  And found the text/icons hard to read - white/grey text on black/grey background is not what writing will be like in the future. 

I'll need to play a few more times to rate this.

RATING: 6
Mecanisburgo is...interesting. It's a worker placement game at its heart but with much more chaos than worker placement usually has. The agents (workers) are placed into ten regions of the board which grant the ability to execute special character actions, and to take the Opportunity card present which is either an agent or a property - properties are generally buffs of some type. At the end of each turn players may invest in major projects if they have the appropriate totals in research and prestige - these projects grant a large amount of VPs and seem generally worth doing. On turns 3 and 4 of the 4-turn game, automatic victory conditions will be revealed which can short-circuit the normal victory process.

The player aids are pretty good, and I don't think the game is as difficult to learn as its reputation suggests. There's a lot of chrome, probably much of it unnecessary, but it's all put to service in relentless development of theme. The conflict resolution is borrowed from Dungeon Twister, if you've played that - players add their total strength in a region, then play action cards from a deck that replenishes every turn with values 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6. Holding back higher cards for the entire turn grants income so there is a tradeoff for exerting one's utmost in a conflict.

The consensus in our group was that there was too much effort expended learning for what we got out of it, though. In the end it's worker placement/area control but there are so many special powers to keep straight that just the sheer number of options taxes the brain.

Mecanisburg is far less than the sum of its parts. It is haphazard and incoherent, and for no reason. The designer dumped a bunch of crap into a rulebook that is probably the worst I've ever seen in terms of organization and clarity, and clearing that hurdle just lands the players in a meaningless abyss. Add some some lame and generic cyberpunk artwork, and call it a Sci-fi epic. Totally bogus. There's no immersion here. There's no tangible setting, even. It's just a bunch of cyberpunk tropes thrown in a blender: ninja assassins, hackers, psychics, megacorporations. The thing plays like a 10-minute brainstorming session, thematically and mechanically. Shortly after playing, it dawned on me that I held the individual mechanics in contempt - every single one of them. There is no frame of reference, no core premise gone wrong, no glimmer of interest anywhere in the whole thing. It's a mess, and if you sorted it all into piles, you'd promptly throw each one in the garbage.

This is really not easy to rate - there is certainly a lot going on and there are multiple ways to victory and I have not played the game often enough to really have a good understanding of all possibilities and strategies. Unfortunately, this complexity is also my strongest critique: There are MANY layers and interdependencies to consider and than sometimes all boils down to a single draw of cards which have a randomizing effect (values from 0 to 8) on the outcome of various actions, which at their turn can have fundamental effect on the game. Moreover, during the game new victory conditions may be drawn, with the result that long term strategies can become worthless and somebody that seemed to be totally behind wins the game. All in all, I have the feeling that the game suffers from the unfortunate combination of strong impact of luck on the one hand and a brain burning complexity on the other hand, which is, to me, a rather unfortunate combination in a game that lasts about 2 hours.

Very unique, high themed, interactive game. 
Asset management, with little to no randomness as too how you manage, rather the randomness is mostly limited to the cards that show up (which you have choices on how to act upon). Despite all the complaints of complexity and layout, this game should not be judged until you've got a semi-grasp of the rules, icons, skills and professions. Once you've reached this state (typically after one game) you'll soon see that the game offers a highly rewarding interaction of mild strategy, high management and even an element of denial and jocular screwing over of your friends. Multiple paths to victory and even options/capabilities to come from behind which is a big plus for me as I can't stand games that have runnaway victories. 

Again: do not judge this game on your first play! It deserves a second outing, trust me.

Played again with 5 and it was an absolute blast. Don't listen to those who say you should play only with 3 or 4. Granted the game took 5 hours (4 first time players), but it was engaging throughout. The special victory conditions are really neat - they offer hope to those who are behind and give focus to and increase the intensity of the board play.

An intriguing cyber-punkish theme mixed with some conflict and an assortment of euro-style mechanics plus tons of chrome.  Keep a rule book nearby when you play because there are enough scenario exceptions and icons to make even an ASLer weep.

It's truly a labor of love and I "get" why people would like it.  For me though there was just too much going on.  I had so much trouble trying to figure out what my own powers and tactical options were that there was no way I could look at the minute detail of my opponents' corporations/characters to figure out how I could compete with them.  There are also various characters and events that provide victory conditions that pop up in the game in a way that may surprise those that aren't prepared.

With a lot more games under my belt I would eventually grok the system but at this time I feel it may be too much of a lovely mess to spend the energy sorting it all out.

Woah, what a game; so many choices, so much material, so much craziness; when you don´t be afraid of complicated rules and like this "special" sci-fi theme, take a look and accept the deep learning curve (which you will ease by using the top game aids BGG provides).

After one play, I really enjoyed it.  But the more I thought of it, the more I realized I never wanted to get all that junk out again... way too overproduced, and too much stuff in the box.  Not enough game there for the effort required to play.

Picked up at Essen 2008. Great theme, very fine graphics, solid mechanics (e.g. worker placement etc) with lots of player interaction, roleplaying and CCG elements make this a very promising game. Seems to scale quite nicely (played 4 and 2 player games so far).

Recommended as a thematic WP game. In theory, this game sounds incredibly awesome. In practice, I'm alsmost certain that it will in practice fail with my co-players because of the frustration the first plays are said to create. Consequently, it will hardly hit the table for a second time.

RATING: 5
This game just had too much going on.  There were literally around 50 different icons, each of which had a different rules set associated with them, and each card had a different combination of 3-5 of those icons, along with 5 different numerical stats.  To excel at this game, not only do you have to know what each of the icons on the cards you have does, you also need to be aware of what all the icons on other people's cards do so you can tell how badly they can screw you over.  Each player starts out with 5 of these cards, and can accumulate upwards of 15 by the time the game is done.  I think I can hold a lot of information in my head at one time, but this is ridiculous.

The game I played was very long, but not because the game was inherently long.  Instead, it involved long periods of one player staring at the (thick) rulebook while everyone else did nothing in particular.  And yes, that was after a lengthy rules explanation.

A game I really want to like. Problem is that the iconography leaves even Race for the Galaxy in the dust. Clunky and confusing on first play. Somewhere beneath the muck of confusion I suspect there is a really good game tough - the question is whether one is willing to put in the effort. I'll have to convince my gaming group giving it a second try.

Update after both a second and a third try I must confess that I rather like this game. The clunkiness prevails though.

Rating reserved.

The head to head, telescoping blind auctions for each space make for wonderful moments and tense game play.  The scope lends itself to lots of strategic thinking and plenty of temporary alliances and back stabbing.

Still, everyone seems to feel like there is something that needs fixing.  My impression is that it takes about half a game to learn the value of your various assets and it is likely too late at that point to be competitive.  The game could use an easy mode or some sort of round 0 that more slowly introduces the game play.

Looking forward to further plays, drop me a line if you are in the DC Metro and want to play.  Teaching the game is a bear.

I marked it as 6 only... probebly because I played it only the second time. And I feel that this is a game that You have play much more times to see what it really offers. Like you have so many choices, also you have to get by an experiments what works the best for You. Every fraction is quite different. In the beginning some players argued that their fraction is lame. Then after the seceond full play we saw that they have many adventages and also some disadvantages. You have to know the game well to play it well. But... now I mark it as 6.

This is a good game. My only play was in less than ideal circumstances, standing in for a player who dropped out just after the rules explanation, in a game of six players I think, where no one had played before. But the game shone through. Everything and the kitchen sink thrown into this one, but it is well worth persevering with.

Outstanding game with great theme.  There's so much going on in the game with everyone fighting over characters and properties plus working towards getting special projects.  Then having to worry about your employees being seduced away or assassinated.  And look out for those global threats that hurt everyone!  Giant monster anyone?  Sure it can be hard during your first play but no worse then my first play of Race for the Galaxy, which I also love.

Please disregard the rating.  It could really swing somewhere between a 3 and a 9 depending on my mood and more plays. As of right now I'm just fascinated with it as an oddity.

This is the Southland Tales of boardgames. It is bloated and beautiful.  It is buckling under its own weight, but I can't help but be enthralled by all the spinning wheels no matter how cludgy it is.  It meanders and winds, there is a ton of unexplained material crammed in it. It plays straight, despite having its tongue firmly planted in its cheek. It is opaque but the color is entrancing.  It has no desire to be accessible. Is is brilliant or stupid?  I'm not sure. 

My fantasy for this game is that three different Euroheads agreed to make a theme driven game and designed it separately communicating solely through semaphore. After a teletyped conference they discovered that somehow all of their designs could be stitched together like some Frankenstein Monster. Realizing that it needed some work, they gave it to Don Greenwood to develop.

If Avalon Hill were around today this is the kind of thing that they would be putting out.  I cannot expect anyone to like this game or want to play it twice.  It is like trying to turn someone on to Gunslinger, Magic Realm or Merchant of Venus.  It does exactly what it sets out to do, but the level of information that each player must frontload is intense.  With that, I should mention that this game is up to date with all the modern game designs.  By all, I mean that as literal as possible. It feels like every game that this guy liked is packed in.  Aladdin's Dragons, blind worker placement/Area Control (x5), Race for the Galaxy icons (x5), Coop elements with dangers that effect every player, plus card combos and special powers (x 5). All information is pushed beyond comprehension, and just in case you tried to figure it all out, the one million types of combat are blind and occasionally quite lucky.

Tons of theme, tons of character, and strangely a smooth euro once you learn all the rules.

My only two complaints are that the insta-win cards seem exceptionally lucky (I'm on the fence about how I feel about them), and the board resolution order is really confusing (This is something that you can become accustom to, but the graphic design is just poor).

There is a great game in here.However,very flawed! Terrible rule book (at least in English) ,Silly victory conditions, too many things going on - they really threw in the kitchen sink. Theme fantastic, the balances are fascinating, lovely production. A+ for designing a game that does not conform to modern design mores - however some discipline could have made this a masterpiece. Nevertheless will play more as i feel this derserves further exploration.

wooow.. big-big respect to designer for putting this together!  ..my top conflict euro-style game ever*! ..it works soo great.. and it really is thematic, unbelievable..  
Can't wait to add some expansions, need promos..
LOVE IT!

E: yummy, I got it all complete (but one mystery promo card) and celebrating that monumental moment, I put that in some insanely awesome MaxProt. 'NEO' metallic sleeves, kinda 'dark oiled water' goody..soo touching! :D

E:  (aint no filler here, have some spare 4+hours..I have got some for this happily..but I only wish I had more opportunities to play this in 6-7 players..sigh) 

..I just love this* hidden Workers Placment/auctioning/area cont.+infl./spec.pows/bit of bluff w.piece of luck/CDG/corp.id.dev./aggressive sort of rat race/narrative theater..in such a beloved theme settings, filled with weird micro-stories..

ehm a fair rating should be 7,42+/- while the rulebook needs some complete redo, hell it's so hard to search through for details on various principles.. but after 2-3 games it really opens ..and icons shouldn't be a big deal after the first focused play heh

This game stays.

I love area majority, but in this game area majority is hidden under secret unit deployment and action cards that are essentially blind bidding. Like that wasn't enough, the outcome is not only determined by those agents and action cards, there are also assassinations, AI peripherals and rotating some properties that affect. I like my area majorities to be more trackable, so if you're looking for a scifi themed area majority game, look elsewhere.

Rules could be more clear. It's not easy to just read them through and start playing. You should definitely make sure you have enough time to read them and do a little back and forth while reading. And forget about teaching this game to casual gamers. Half way through the rules they will hold you down while one of them draws symbols on your forehead and you can guess which ones.

I wanted to love this game. It has a velocyberaptor! But for a game that takes this much time and effort, it's too random. My opponent was leading big time, but I managed to pull of a special victory condition. This would be fine in a shorter game or a game that's easier to play and doesn't require constant thought, but now it just felt that the game fell a bit flat. I don't even want to think about playing this game with 6 players. I guess downtime would kill me when waiting for resolutions on areas I'm not involved.

Iconography has been an issue with this game, but for me the symbols actually made sense. A cocktail glass for socializing etc. I know many games with random symbols that make no sense and you actually have to learn them by heart. These symbols were logical, at least for me. There are a lot of them though, so it's still a challenge to remember them.

it is a difficult game to get started on.  the rules are not that great... they are missing some important informatino, and other important information is buried in text.  it is great and very developed on theme though.  the icons are many, and most make sense after you've played the first turn or two.  definitely requires a practice play.  the importance of the various skills and resources come through play, and so early mistakes can cost you the game if you're not aware.  all in all, it is fun though, maybe with some tweaks, and if it could be brought to two hours, it would be a keeper.

RATING: 6.5
Somewhat long and there seem to be too many icons condensed into each cards.  A very weird mix of mechanics including area majority, blind bidding, worker placement and card tapping.  Some works well while others not so much.  I like the fact that there is a set number of rounds, but I didn't really care for the instant-win conditions.  The theme is definitely strong and there is an interesting game here, but I believe Mecanisburgo is ultimately overburdened by its numerous mishmash of ideas to make the play an actual enjoyable experience.  A good (and probably too ambitious of an) effort by a new designer.

RATING: 7.5
This game will only appeal to a small niche of people.  The basic mechanics are really not that bad.  However,there are tons and tons of races, corporations, professions, skills, event, threats, robots, and locations all with special rules and icons.  At times, I almost wish they had used larger cards with more text to explain its abilities like Magic or War of the Ring rather than try to do it all through icons, which does not really simplify the game at all.  The sheer numbers of icons makes Race for the Galaxy look like Candy Land.  All of these options allow a wide variety of actions to occur with many different modifiers.  Something as simple as establishing control involves several steps with different mechanics.  As a result, the learning curve for this game is extremely high and it will be hard to simply pick this game up and introduce it to new players.  I also doubt if you would be able to play it again without some major rereading of the rules if much time has elapsed.  But if you are looking for a meatier game, give this one a look.  The theme is also quite different from most sci-fi games - the closest example might by Galactic Destiny because you assemble a team of characters with various abilities.

The basic system is simple.  But, filled with huge amount of gadgets.  So, it is not easy to play for the first time.

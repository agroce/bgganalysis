Very solid - one of my earlier acquisitions. Looks beatuiful.

RATING: 6
Blind bidding and some bluff plus simultaneous movement make for a high degree of chaos.  The mechanic of unused building blocks hastening the end of the game is clever.  However, the end always seems to come before the game really develops.  Production quality and artwork are excellent.  A near miss.

Disappointed with this one, especially after hearing so much about it.  It's not that game is bad, because it's not - it's pretty good actually.  And interesting.  And kind of clever.  And then it ends before it really gets started.  And I'm not sure how to "fix" it.  You put out several piles of blocks each turn, and then players bid for them.  The blocks not won go to build a sort of giant "time clock" pyramid - when it's built, the game ends.  Cool stuff.  But since some piles are "better" than others, they often get multiple bids, meaning a LOT of other piles get passed up, and, before you know it, that giant pyramid is finished.  I've tried putting out fewer piles (less variety made it unbalanced) and fewer blocks per pile (removed the tension of restricted building since you weren't as locked in).  Both were unsatisfying.

Intense, quick blind bidding/area control game.  Really cool brain burny type of game.  Simple rules but a ton going on.  Everything ties together well.  Rating could go up after I play it more.  Played with four but I could see where this would be potentially very cool with two (perhaps slightly different).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game with a number of nice aspects, but doesn't quite pull it together.  My one game ended up coming down to one or two blind bids with no way to guess what people would take (since the remaining pyramids were no longer "pure").

Amazingly cool game and quite thematic for a Euro.  Sadly my multiplayer opportunities these days are limited and like all auction type games it really benefits from 3 or 4 players.

RATING: 7.5
For a game of this age, I was pleasantly surprised. There are some great mechanics here, and a game that holds up very well.  The auction/bluff bidding was really fun.

If you add beautiful components, you get a game that I'd really enjoy revisiting. I'm not sure there is anything here you haven't seen redone in later games, but I'm also not sure its been improved on to the point of being obsolete. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very pleasant, 
perhaps the 6 square movement is too much predictable : so long turn angst if players want to predict everything (steal or not be stolen)
Give it 8 if it was not so bad when you are unlucky at taking stones (bidding & bluffing is good but it could hurt some players !)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Perhaps a weak 7 but that's based on just one play of the game. Very good looking game. Bidding is interesting but I'm not yet sure of the proper tactics. None of us saw any brilliant manuevers to make. You bid on Building blocks for your pyramids and move your workers around but I'm not sure there is any depth to the game. The proper play seemed obvious to us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is not really what I had hoped it would be. It looks absolutely cool with the triangular board and the emerging pyramids, but there are too few movement points to go around meaning that everyone will happily build in their own little corner only to be bothered by theft once every while; and since unbuilt stones end up in the central pyramid there really isn't that much incentive to grab more than one group: you won't be able to build more stones than just that one group anyway. 

The result is somewhat of a grating experience which never really wants to take off. Bidding is locked down because you cannot bid too much either (and risk the game's end coming at you all the quicker), and after that it's a very precarious balance between stealing from miles away and building in patterns you don't really want to build but must out of fear the game will end that much quicker for it. The variant rule I dug up from some forgotten website—it may have very well been Spielbox's—which has you spending left-over bidding power as if they were movement points actually makes a lot more sense under these circumstances. 

My fellow players weren't best pleased with this game, and to be honest I was feeling a little ashamed about putting it in front of them. I want to give it another attempt, though, this time with the knowledge that TdK requires a specific approach; and see what happens then. If it remains lackluster, then it's off to the great marketplace in the sky, I'm afraid.

RATING: 7
Very nice looking game.  This one is fun, but the blind bidding mechanism is not for everyone.  Unfortunately, I've found that too many games end in a tie. Probably not worth the price, but I enjoy playing it occasionally now that I own it.

RATING: 4
Production: All pieces are well made.  For the most part there was little conflict over any particular space around a given pyramid, so I'm not sure they needed to be cluttered up with individual numbering.  Play: Fairly quick play, with simple yet enjoyable bidding, pawn movement, and block placement.  (2+0+2) (1 play)

An auction game which can be very, very short, if players actively conspire to dump bricks or cannot use luckily gotten lots of bricks.  Very kewl bits tho.  And could be excellent with the right group.

RATING: 4
Players spend action points to move across the board and construct pyramids.  The more pure (fewer colours) the pyramid is, the more valuable it is.  Great looking game, but a bit dated these days.  A pain to try and store the large triangular box too!

A beautiful looking abstract game that fell completely flat with anyone I tried it on.

This was one of the first german games I was exposed to and made me fall completely in love with this subset of nerdom.  I really enjoy the semi-blind bidding system with its bluffing chips giving a nice edge to each round of play.  The components are fantastic, both beautiful and tactile, everything blends with a visual functionality within the game.

If you have a very confrontational group who will spend a lot of the game trying to grab each others sites then you definitely want to use the rules tweak of only dumping half the unused blocks onto the great pyramid, otherwise the game will end too quickly.

RATING: 6.5
Blind building and some nice building. With a bit of tweaking, this could easily be re-issued today. But it didn't set me alight, too much screwage or wasted moves. There's something there, but I'm not sure I'd buy this game today.

This is a fun pyramid building game that I like alot. I am a sucker for anyhting in the Egyptian theme. The bits in this game are of a nice wooden quality and look amazing once the pyramids begin to arise. I had a heck of a time tracking down a copy of this game due to being in the USA, but am so glad that I fianlly got a copy. This is alot of fun with many decisions on how you want to go about things and hoping your opponents aren't thinking the same thing as you. If you can find a copy of this I would surely buy it. It has a feel to it unlike most of my games which is a nice change of pace.

Nice looking game, beautiful components. 

My big gripe is the auction system which feels very random, while a system like RA or Amun-Re could have been used nicely. 

The game is very short, but in the end there is little to do since there seems to be little choice. So I'd say an anticlimactic ending.

I bought this game as a birthday gift for my new fiancee (now wife). She's an archaeologist and thought she would appreciate the pyramid theme. This was when German games were on the upswing, and I could only find it at a store in the UK where I paid $120 overall for shipping, currency issues, etc.

A very good blind bidding / bluffing game with nice offensive and defensive elements. Seems like it would work best with a full four players, but 3 is also good if one player isn’t left alone while the other two fight it out.  Bits are top notch, but the box is a bear to store.

RATING: 5
I'm not sure if this is a good game for 2 players.  However, I think with 3-4 players, this game could potentially shine.  Its very simple and straightforward to play with bidding on block sets, moving overseers, moving workers, potentially stealing blocks based on overseers, potentially stealing ownership of a pyramid with more workers and overseers than the other people, then building pyramids to attempt to score...which is based on solidity of color of the pyramid and whether its big or small.

For no good reason other than looks, and a healthy does of board game collector sickness, I finally found a copy of this game that was affordable.

I will have trouble getting it to the table but I have that problem with many of the games I buy given I have three active buyers in my small gaming group.

Purchased from an attendee at the Great Lakes Games Con in November 2009. It's in amazing condition. Even the wipe away pens still work.

The game can end very quickly.  This game can get very cut throat as well...  Two overseers are definitely not enough.  The blocks and board are very nice but the bid cards and are poorly designed and very difficult to tell apart.

RATING: 7
Very abstract pyramid building game.  You have builders and supervisor to move with a limited number of move.  There is also an auction mechanism to alot rock cube to build your pyramid.  The most interesting aspect of this game is the "Take That" element which is subtil and the timer of the game.  I quite like it.

Good Eurogame. I like the sneakiness of the blind bidding, stealing bits & taking over of incomplete pyramids. Not so good with 2, nice with 3, probably good with 4 player as well.

Lots of fun choices in a short play time.  Mastering the bidding is quite a challenge.  The only down side is, it is not very forgiving.  A bad choice can crush you.  That's a small matter though when you consider the unique niche this game fills.  Plus it plays quickly enough.

First impression (3 players): There is once around the table blind bidding that can screw you royally as you might not get anything if the worst case scenario happens. You then build up pyramids using the pieces you got from the auction by using/moving workers. I kind of liked the game but there was too much randomness/chaos for as long game as it was. What combinations comes up to auction and then rather chaotic blind bidding out of them was a tad too much. Probably best when played with 3 players.

All spectacle no game. It is definitely a novelty piece in a collection. I have to say quality game even down to the pens included for dry erase which still worked after 20+ years. I liked the bidding in this game but I felt a bit lost in the final rounds when all locations were locked up and there was nothing for me to do but bid and hope to complete the pyramid in the middle. A good game to play once.

RATING: 6.5
Strange that for a blind bidding game that this should be such a brain burner.  There is a huge screwage factor here where players can get closed out of building, turns of work can get stolen, pyramids can get eroded, and all in all people can really get hosed out of their turns.  You have to be prepared for this if you are going to play the game. Overall, I think it is a fine game, that sadly suffers from uneven scoring.  The game just doesn't make it valuable enough to build up perfect pyramids.  The scores need adjustments.  If this could be done then I think that fans of Taj Mahal would really love this system.  A shame about the 80's neon and the akward box.

Stunningly beautiful game with more to like than just its looks. Update: I probably first played this in 1997. Starting in 2010, I began revisiting a lot of older, more obscure titles I enjoyed back when. Like many, but not all, Tal der Konig hasn't aged well. The auction mechanic is stilted and very constraining, and the pyramid-building just isn't as interesting as I had remembered it. The whole game pretty much boils donwn to making the right guess about where to move your overseers (attack or defense), and there's really not enough going on to make the game all that engaging. The bits are still beautiful, but my rating has moved from a 7 to 5 and my 2011 playing of Tal der Konig is probably my last.

RATING: 5
This was never a great design and doesn't show up well at all by current standards (honestly the rating includes a point or so of respect for its age and nice components). Bidding for the blocks is OK, for a blind bid, but moving your overseers around is essentially also a blind bid and it devolves into a guessing game if players want to steal blocks or entire sites. If they don't then there's really not much to the game at all.

What a beautiful game - if only the game mechanics were beautiful as well :)
Seriously: it's a nice majority/influence game with blind auctioning. A bit too chaotic for my taste but only toying around with those nice cubes is worth trying the game at least.

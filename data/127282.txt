RATING: 6
It’s reasonably standard fayre for a  worker placement game but the options are, of course, too numerous for you to be able to do everything you want and the decision making can be quite difficult and tense at times.Unfortunately, the game is spoilt – and I mean really spoilt- by the quality of some of the components. Not the pieces themselves (they are of very good quality and the game looks very good). But the choice of font and the size of that font is quite like nothing I have come across before

RATING: 7.5
Absolutely underrated! It's a very nice game, with clever worker placement and resource management mechanisms characterized by a lot of interaction and nasty moves to put your opponents in trouble. The arts, even if nice looking, is not functional enough to let players reading the words easily. I like playing this game!

As others have commented, Al Rashid's core mechanic is similar to Leonardo da Vinci's, with workers of different values spent in auctions for different varieties of stuff.  There are two kinds of area on the board; map areas provide resources to be spent in city areas on new workers and titles (which give benefits and victory points).

Al Rashid is a snowball game.  Get an advantage in workers early and you'll gather more resources to get more workers and titles - and win.  With just five turns, I suspect it's really difficult to recover from a poor start. With five players, Al Rashid is also chaotic and brutal.  Much of that comes from the players taking turns to pick the next area to be resolved.  Planning to get resources to pay for something expensive in the city?  Things may not turn out in that order.  Wasted a turn?  You've lost.  

Al Rashid is a handsome and well produced game, but it suffers from the use of a nearly unreadable font on the board.  The rules are pretty badly written with ambiguities and gaps.

First of all: the components.
I read many critiques on BGG, so I was a little worried, but in the end the game reminded me of some of the older Treefrog titles: it has an unfortunate choice of colours, but is very playable with a printed player aid depicting all the titles tiles.

What is a little disappointing is the rulebook: it is convoluted and has various holes, so a FAQ reading is highly recommended before the first play.

But what about the game?

It is very solid! Al rashid lasts 5 turns (and doesn't overstay its welcome), with every turn consisting of just 2 phases: placement (where players place various pieces to gain majorities in different areas, like in Leonardo Da Vinci) and resolution (where players in turn choose to activate and resolve an area - even without own pieces present! And this can be very nasty! - to obtain wares, titles and other bonuses).

There is a bit of area control, a sense of building à la Puerto Rico, a very interesting money sistem, and a great deal of player interaction.

Definitely a good game!

Despite the underdeveloped rulebook and issues with the components/color/font size, the unique mechanics and engaging gameplay more than made up for the game's initial shortcomings.

The resource/money conversion, the procedure for turn order and the different twist on resolving actions via worker placement give the game a unique flavor not normally found in games of this genre.

Printing player aids from BGG for the tiles is highly recommended to make gameplay smoother. Definitely a keeper, but make sure to bring your reading glasses if you're not up to printing player aids.

What a waste of a game, the game play seem great but sadly hampered but some of the worst graphic decisions ever.  A terrible font picked that is unreadable, text on cards that appear to be a 5pt font in cursive on a dark background.  Game graphics should help game play not hinder.  If the graphics in this one could have meet that standard I would purchase it, maybe someone will buy the mechanics and reprint with better graphics.

The basis of the game is to collect sets of goods and translate them into Money which allows you to gain titles and then gain prestige and ultimately win. 

The only negative is the colours are not as clear as they could be and the text could be a little larger but it does not take anything away from the game.

RATING: 7
Solid, cutthroat Euro. Timing is very interesting here, since other players can activate your spots even if their pieces are not there, and even before you are ready to pay for them. This can make the game incredibly angering/frustrating, but also deliciously vicious when you do it to others. The special powers/scoring tiles open up different routes to victory, and I really liked how the military tiles added a risk factor to the worker-placement mechanic.

RATING: 7
I liked this except for the tiny tiles of the characters you have bought as the writing is really small. I'm sure a deck of cards would be better. Gameplay is quite fun though and there is very odd indirect ways of screwage but it tends to not happen much as it kind of encourages retaliation which could really mess up your plan for the turn. Interesting Game. 1 Play.

Everything about this game is under-cooked.  The graphic design is terrible (which is sad because many of the artboards are quite striking).  The design is interesting but, by an large, feels like a first draft of Vanuatu with a military element in place of exploration.  

As it stands, I think this is a "7" brought low by presentation and a lack of development.  But, it's not a game without hope, and I would play it again.

It's always interesting (and sometimes even fun) to see how a game compares in real life to what you had imagined it would be based on a written description. In my case I had decided that there might be some Mykerinos in Al Rashid: there was a round of influence placement which would net something, which could then be used in a different phase or during a subsequent first phase. I was, as it turned out, partially correct about this approach, but Al Rashid is so different that any resemblence to Ystari's ageing majority game is just cursory.

At the same time Al Rashid feels dated the moment you learn what needs doing. If I were to replace 'Mykerinos' with 'Leonardo da Vinci' in the above paragraph, we'd already be a lot closer to what it is all about. It is a dry worker placement game featuring several areas where resources are to be had; and several areas where important Game Stuff is to be had. Resources become money on the fly when turned in; a particular set is simply worth a fixed amount, and that amount is immediately used to purchase something, namely Game Stuff. That can be either new influence to place (which is a good thing in at least two ways because it makes you more powerful in the placement phase, as well as netting you more VP at the end of the game), or soldiers for hire (to run off nasty random invaders who hinder the resource areas), or changes in turn order, or a character (who is basically worth points, but also gives you an ability which you can use once, or for the remainder of the game). After five rounds of placing and resolving influence, the victor is the one with the most VP. That's it. The only interesting thing about Al Rashid is that the players get to decide the order of resolution, which can admittedly lead to a bit of nastiness as sometimes a player relies on getting a particular resource before he spends it. Reverse that order and he has wasted a lot of placement potential.

I really could not understand why at Spiel this game was supposed to enamour the players of complex games; or even why purchasing it cost a hefty €50. Starting with that: admittedly the wooden pieces look well-machined and as a result play very nice (the flat discs have rounded edges, not something you see every day), but the overall artwork appears to be an exercise in creating a vision in five coloured hues of grey. The artwork on the character tiles was difficult to discern from a distance, making the effort of coming up with different characters a bit superfluous. I certainly didn't feel like hiring some grizzled mercenary: I just wanted the card for its ability! And adding insult to injury: a player aid detailing all the character abilities, vital for this sort of game as a teaching aid, is missing from the box, and has to be made by oneself... As for the game: we did run into a few nasty spots when the order of resolution turned out to be not quite what we expected it to be, but at the same time so many players are multiplexing various areas that being too nasty would just have shut the game down, turning placement into a worthless joke in the process. So while definitely present, I treat it for the moment as a threat which is occasionally delivered rather than a solid part of the resolution phase. And the rest is just... uninspired. Money begets more influence plus rule-modifying cards which in turn beget more money: that's not going to deliver a wow!-experience these days. To make matters worse, it lasts for well over 90 minutes, unfortunately exacerbated by exactly Al Rashid's unique selling point of player-decided resolution. That's too long for what I get out of it: an uncertain development path, and random mercenaries and brigands.

In the end I thought that although the game itself appeared fine, even without a detailed knowledge of all the character cards, it left an impression of superfluousness. It attempts to position itself in a niche which is already full of other titles which I think appeal more to gamers. If you like special character powers then you may want to look at Al Rashid, but other than that... I can't recommend this title based on its general characteristics, nor am I interested in replaying any time soon.

Salvaged my interest in Euros, even if the 'let's resolve that area before you trade here to afford a Title or Service there' takes it into a non-Euro territory I guess. The size of text on title cards is a slight nuisance but didn't ruin the game. Rulebook is pretty easy to follow, but could do with more pictures of the components to help visualize the game. 

Snatched from the discount bin at a local board game store, 25€ well spent. Probably not worth a lot more than that because there are probably similar Euros with better production out there.

In many ways, this represents everything that is wrong with Eurogaming at the moment:   bland or non-existent theme, ugly and non-functional components, completely derivative and unoriginal mechanisms.    The game is essentially about various sized workers placed as bids into regions where prescribed piles of resources are laid out.   This can be nasty, because if you don’t have enough influence in a region, you might get little or even nothing in return.   The game Dakota did this exact same thing, but at least that game had some strong theming.   Here, the Arabic flavor is present, but you’d be hard-pressed to describe what the theme of the game is.   It’s just flavor.    Many of the components that should have been cards are done as tiles instead.   This makes the cost and text on the character tiles so small that nobody can read them from a distance.   Useless.   5 years ago, this might have been a more inspired design in spite of the graphic design problems, but certainly not now.

Interesting worker placement and area control mechanics.   The best bits are the way these mechanics interplay with each other, very clever and very interesting.  The downside is the reliance on cards with small print and variable effects which you have to understand before playing.  And then on top of that is the most useless rule book known to man.

Nice varied worker placement game. A good chunk of your victory points comes from just increasing your workers. The priority system leaves for some interesting interactions and lots of opportunities to mess with your opponents. I like the money system as well, unique, easy to understand and makes all the spaces relevant in some way. All together a unique, fun game, with tons of interaction.

The titles on the board are hard to read, but unnecessary, they are made to look Arabic, but are all in a very arty font in english. It makes the board look very unique, and everyone at first glance assumes its not in english.

I liked it back in 2012 and I still do, 4 years later. Even though there's nothing new or special about this game, I like the options you have, aswell as the tense game it offers.

While the game looks gorgeous, the size of the text and colors of the tiles (being way too similar) are one of the worst you'll ever see in gaming. That however doesn't make the game itself less interesting to me.

The order of resolving places is very important in this game and so is your planning. The abilities from the characters you can hire is pretty much the heart of the game and offer quite some interesting combinations.

The game is worker placement plus area control. Al Rashid reminds me the game Vanuatu. Unlike the simpleness of Vanuatu, Al Rashid added more rule details. Al Rashid is a more complicating game than Vanuatu. For me, this is not my cup of tea. First, the game takes too long time. Players are spending lots of time for finding optimum choices throughout game. Second, the competitiveness is too fierce. This is not suitable for normal boardgamers. Al Rashid may be appealed to those hard gamers who like to harass the opponents more than enjoying game itself. Third, the legibility of the game components are too bad. For these reasons, I've already sold away the game. It is really hard to figure out the text on the game parts. I've already decided to enjoy other classic area control games more instead of Al Rashid.

RATING: 5.5
This is an OK game that, for me, overstayed its welcome by at least an hour, with what is normally a fairly fast group. Part of this is the ridiculously small font on the 20+ special power cards (called "titles"). But mostly it's the fact that the game has 20+ special power cards! I felt that this is one of those games where all the wacky special powers and potential synergies/"paths to victory" distract from a decent core game.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (April 2016)

As is usual from me, I didn’t know what to expect from the game. Before playing it I learned that it is from the same guy that designed Hyperborea and Asgard and I really like those games, so my expectation went up.  After playing it, I can say my initial impressions are positive, however, the rulebook and graphic design almost killed the game for me (last month A Fool´s Fortune was killed by the rulebook as well). I don’t understand how a publisher spends a lot of time/money only to drop the ball, in what I consider to be, the easier part of the job.  

Al Rashid´s theme is ok for me and the game components are very good (specially the resources). The art is also good.

The game isn’t very hard to understand, but reading the rulebook is hard because it was written in an illogical manner and it has some ambiguities and omissions (it says the crisis tiles are revealed at the start and at the end of the turn, clearly one of them is wrong). The setup is very confusing. I had to read it twice before playing the game and that consumes time. There is a rewrite of the rulebook that you can find here on BGG. Those rules are much better, but they still have some problems (they change the value of the Pashas, they don’t explain how the credit notes work and, worse of all, they don´t explain how the intrigue palace works). To summarize, the rulebook is very bad, but not a deal killer by itself. The WORST issue by far was the terrible graphic design of the game. The writing is VERY small. In our game, we had a lot of trouble reading the tiny text on the titles, also the costs were gold numbers on a gold background :/ (who decided THAT?), we spent a lot of time taking the tiles to review them closely by the light. There was literally a player who couldn’t read the text so we had to read for him each time. The font, although thematic, renders the text hard to read. They tried to cram a lot of text in the small title tiles, but the crisis tiles are very big and still the letters are very small, they wasted a lot of space. All of these issues can be solved printing some player´s aids, but still it is amazing that they published the game with those glaring problems unsolved. They render the game, almost, unplayable.

The game has worker placement mixed with area control, but it has 3 different workers that have different values. All the game revolves around the “Domination” concept. Only the 3 first players will be able to benefit from each spot, so I think the game is best played with 5 fast players, with less, there is a lot less tension as you can almost guarantee a third place in each location. Al Rashid’s Palace seems the weakest of all. In our game no one placed a pawn there, but perhaps that was an anomaly. I need to play it again to really see.

Al Rashid offers lots of interesting decisions (where to place my workers, what title should I buy, should I use the primary actions or the favors, should I change the turn order, in which order to place my workers) and they aren’t obvious in any way. There are two phases and it is rather easy to upset a player´s plans in the resolution phase, so you need to carefully asses your situation and turn order (good stuff, I love it). In this way, it is definitely reminiscent of Vanuatu (a game I love). Timing is everything in the game.

The luck factor is rather low and, totally, controllable (with the spies and bodyguards). 

The dishonor concept seems very neat, but no one took dishonor in our game, I need to play it more, but perhaps it will appear in battles. I don’t see how a player can get dishonor in the palaces (unless he made a very big planning mistake).

I love how the resources work. There is no money in the game and each resource is worth the same as every other resource. To have a lot of money, you need to have different resources. It is very novel. 

Bottom line, I need to play the game again but I feel there is a good (and cutthroat) euro game here. With the graphic design and rulebook issues resolved, I feel Al Rashid would be among my favorite games of all time. Perhaps it still can get an upgraded rating from me. For now, I’m keeping the game but I feel the issues stopped it from being a renowned game.

A perfectly competent set collection / worker placement game, with some unfortunate graphic design issues.

The player-determined resolution order is the sharp edge that'll decide how this game works. E.g. the start player who has stockpiled some resources can easily bully other people out from one of one of the palace spots simply by threatening to resolve it first thing on the next turn, before the others have time to gather resources. It remains to be seen whether in the long term this is interesting or too nasty.

RATING: 9
Quite a splendid game built around several area majority subgames and an impressively smart money management system. It's also very Italian in the sense that there a possibility for heavy screwage, but this has been implemented very well, because it is not encouraged. Definitely one of the highlights of 2012. Unfortunately the game suffers from terrible production qualities and reminds me of some older Warfrog titles in that sense. The game suffers from horrible color layout, an almost unreadable size of a font used in tiles and very badly edited rules. Some people also have issues with the pseudo-Arabic font used. Apart from some rare exceptions rules cover everything, but there is no sign of reasonable order or any compactness. I very dearly suggest printing player aids to help with the title tile management.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The rulebook is bad. The graphic design is horrendous. The game itself is five near-identical rounds of bidding for resource acquisition and expenditure opportunities, with effectively targeted blocking/denial, snowballing into extra bidding power/actions which are also victory points, and counting and recounting how much "money" will be available down any number of potential future paths to avoid wasting actions and losing. When you learn all the tile powers and keep the playing time under three hours, the game probably improves to nothing very special.

Solid Euro Game.

PROS:
Nice mechanics, with a bit of innovation for the worker placement genre.
Good player interaction for an Eurogame, but be warned: it's very, very cutthroat.
Good re-playability

CONS:
Horrible graphic design, expecially the font used for the personalities is small and hard to read, that makes the game hard to play.

Ultimately a good game, don't be scared from the graphic design, 1 or 2 plays make all more clear.
Advised especially for Eurogames lovers.

Ended up selling this one after deciding I prefer Lancaster which also shares some similar aspects.

Area majority game which involves three different types of pieces of differing values and of which the merchant and pasha cannot be placed in the same area but sages can be added to bump up your power.  Two areas of the board exist for majorities; the lands where you can acquire sets of goods and the guilds where you take special actions such as acquiring more workers, military, and titles which grant you special bonuses.  Fail to take a primary action in a guild or run away from battle and you lose points.  Currency is interesting as there is no money or change.  You must turn in sets of unique goods which equal a certain amount of money.  Also, the choice of which region or guild to carry out actions are based on turn order which can lead to messing with someone pretty badly if they did not plan ahead well enough.  This is not a kind game and just one mistake could lose you the game...as I found out the hard way!  First game caused me to want to play again and had me thinking about what I could have done differently.  

I did not care for the text on the titles nor the font used as this made reading difficult. A player aid for the titles is almost mandatory.

First impression:

Really a gamers games. That means a lot of decision, a lot of things to manage, a well done structure and the right amount of details. It is an area control games with some nice new ideas. 
In turn order players place their pawn (in 3 differents kinds and values) in city places and/or lands. Then, in turn order, the player decide which area resolve and, really important aspect, it not need to be an area with that player pawns. The city places will give you titles (abilities and points) and pawns (more actions and points). The lands will give you resources that are used to buy titles and pawns in city places. The order of resolution of the areas is really important and this is add a level of strategy/decision in the game considering that there are titles and a city place that allow player to move pawns from land to land : which area resolve first ?
The economic system is also great: you have no money but 5 different resource that are worth according to their variety, from 1 to 15 gold.
I’m not really impressed by the graphics and disappointed by some “artistic” decision like the font for the name of titles and lands the dimension of the writings on the titles cards. Really nice the pawns on the other side. 
I like it. For sure a game will hit again my tables: a title for gamers and people looking for something to think a lot.

It was love at first sight with this game, or rather, at first play.
Highlights:
I love worker  placement games, and after 10-15 plays i can say that al rashid is one of my favourite ,  with a lot of of interaction with other players and different ways  to plan the strategy that lead you to victory.  
Also a mention to the high quality of tiles, tokens and pawns: tiles are very thick and the wooden pieces are really fine, with original and unique shape.

Weakness:                                                Colors. I really have difficults to recognize tiles colors, and this make set-up a little bit difficult: green inside, purple border, green-palace- that are similar to green-politics.. make me ARGH the first time i've played it . I've even rate it 10 because, after a few plays, i have in my mind all tiles and know where they are and how they're working. And graphic issues did't ruins the gameplay at all.

I would agree that the rules need a rewrite, and yes, the font's an issue on the tiles. But the pitiful whining of some commentators on this site is kind of ridiculous - it doesn't impact the game-play which is streamlined, cut-throat and fun.

Played at Essen 2012 on the Saturday morning. I really like the game mechanics and the flow of the game. There are some nice variations on the worker placement mechanics. I think the theme and artwork ( except for the small font ) are also very good and meld well with the mechanics.

font choice was abysmal and without the printout of all the tiles this is unplayable.

neat action resolution system that thinks out of the box in the worker placement genre.  

i believe that there is a solid game here, but accessibility needs to be improved upon.

This is a weird game. The graphical design of the board and cardboard pieces is horrible. There's a fake arabic font that is unreadable without practice, and the color code for the cardboard pieces is counterintuitive. Also the rulebook makes a poor job of describing what piece is what, so there's some deduction to do at first. Once you get through all these issues, the gameplay is actually solid, though, and the wooden pieces are nice.

Nothing new here. It was really a basic worker-placement game, with nothing truly innovative going on. The graphic design was too clever for its own good: fonts too hard to read and colors too difficult to distinguish. I think that the "screwage factor" was much too high.

I picked up Al Rashid as part of my ongoing quest for the Next Totally Underrated Board Game, and I'm pleased to say it's not the dud its ranking makes it out to be. You can work around the design issues by making some copies of the Title guide at the back of the rulebook, and remember the text background on the Titles matches where you place the Titles on the board. Personally, I like the art and design aesthetic, despite the issues with functionality.

As for the game itself, unfortunately it's fallen rather flat for me. Although it tries for a twist here and there, Al Rashid is ultimately just another resource conversion game: you collect wooden pieces and trade them in for more actions, special powers, and points. Strategies are spelled out for you with the Political Titles, and the tactical tricks you can pull arise mostly from careless play on the part of your opponents. There's no series of "mini-plans" as you'd find in more satisfying two-hour Euros, no pulling off a series of moves that chain together into a big gain. You just get your resources and trade them in.

In the end, sure, I'd play this again, but I in no way need to advocate to do so or have this in my collection.

An excellent and original worker placement game with an amazing resourceeple set collection based money system, overshadowed by a horrendous rulebook and criminally incompetent graphic design.

Resolving the workers has room for lots of vicious screwage, which may or may not prove to be an issue, depending on the playing style of your gaming group.

Very heavy on the price tag department.

Gioco di piazzamento lavoratori con due particolarità: gli acquisti si basano sul baratto; l'ordine di risoluzione delle azioni e variabile (ricorda Vanuatu), determinato dagli stessi giocatori che a turno scelgono quale territorio o quale palazzo risolvere. Con queste caratteristiche il gioco offre una forte interazione. Per colori utilizzati e carattere delle scritte (font e dimensione) il gioco è stato criticato, a mio avviso il tutto risulta molto elegante anche se effettivamente a volte poco leggibile o poco chiaro. Altro aspetto poco gradito sono gli innumerevoli favori che costringono nelle prime i giocatori a concentrarsi nella lettura dei medesimi. In sintesi lo trovo un gioco molto bello che rigioco sempre volentieri, le critiche legate alla produzione non influiscono sulle dinamiche che trovo profonde e interessanti.

Lamb dressed as mutton. A couple of potentially fascinating mechanics in the currency system and player-determined activation, are largely wasted with too much flabbiness and some of the worst presentation imaginable: tiny and unreadable fonts, disastrous colour schemes, and a lack of iconography where needed.

This is one very unforgiving game. One mistake can cost you 1 or 2 dishonor which can really make the difference in this game. And as there only 5 turns, there is very little room to put things right again.

When we play a game with different sort of tiles (in this case titles), we don't explain all the different tiles, but invite everybody to read/discover them during the game and just start playing. For this game however I would recommend that everybody takes a look at the politics-titles before you start. They can give you many points, but are hard to meet the requirements. If you want to take for instance the 1 that requires 6 Sages, you have to take 1 Sage every round, so it's important to know that!

The hard part for me is that you can also activate an area which doens't contain any of your pawns. You should really keep that in mind before putting yourself in a palace without already having the necessary goods or in a geographical area with mercenary's without having the necessary mercenarry tiles!

All that aside, I really enjoyed my 1 play with 5 players. It took us 150 minutes as predicted on the box (30 minutes/player), but it was tense all the time and didn't become boring for a second. It was only in the 5th round that you could predict on who made a chance on winning this game, so no runaway leader problem for this game!

I can see that this game does have quite a lot of depth. Unfortunately, a lot of the depth lies just in planning how to take the actions you want, rather than which ones you should select. For me this was counterintuitive and unsatisfying.

RATING: 8
Rated from one full play, and half a demo at Essen. Al Rashid is an unforgiving game, where you can fall behind early and struggle to catch up, it's a highly interactive game with lots of opportunities to affect other players, and it's a game which suggests it contains a number of viable strategies. It won't be for everyone but if you're after a viscious worker placement game this would fit the bill.

Title to gamers, the various mechanics are easy but hard to master very tasty.

Beautiful debut but I don't get many things done: Written very small hard to read Written Arabic difficult to understand language-dependent Title .... home and Italian composers but English game .... maybe they were better symbols to make it independent of the language ...

I would have bought it but the cost I braked ...

Hopefully CANDU points will be assimilated and improved in the upcoming title ...

Played once with 5P. Al Rashid is a bog standard Euro about placing workers, collecting resources and earning VP (surprise!). A few features edge this title closer towards 'heavy Euro' territory. Namely, each placement area is a majority subgame, and there are special abilities – [i]loads[/i] of them – up for grabs. If anything, this game would benefit from a flowchart detailing all the titles' abilities and which titles complement one another.

The major feature of interest is that the order of resolution is left up to the players.  In other words, the design requires players to plot their actions out in such a way that the order in which they are resolved wouldn't really matter. There is the threat of your opponents leaving you high and dry at the palace without resources, but that happens [i]only if[/i] you are sloppy (or maybe hoping your opponents wouldn't notice). The mechanism adds a wrinkle to the decision process, but unfortunately, it also breaks up the game's pacing.

Putting the unspectacular gameplay aside, the game's fate is sealed by its questionable presentation. The typefaces are microscopic and unnecessarily flourished, the titles have poor colour coordination and player aids are absent in a game which desperately needs them. This is a rare exception when my view of a game is adversely affected by how it looks.

The color scheme certainly needs some getting used to. Not that it is hard to differentiate, but it just seems a bit bleak and depressing. The wood shapes are beautiful, though.

Other than that, it's a bit on the abstract side for my tastes, but a good game all the same.

The Arabic-style font makes it especially hard to read and understand what is going on, but I'm sure with a little experience, this could be overcome. It just seems to start really slowly and that it takes a long time for there to be really juicy choices. In the game I played, the final round was really interesting as there was some serious blocking among the players. I wanted to like this one more, but I don't think it has enough to want me to play it again and again - Vanuatu actually does the mechanic of blocking your opponents actions by order of resolution much better than this one.

This is a worker placement game with a couple of neat concepts.  Each player is a trader in the Middle East collecting goods which are used as currency to obtain titles which are the main source of victory points in this game.

Worker placement is done with pawns of varying sizes.  The larger the pawn, the more influence it is worth and the player with the highest influence in an area when it is resolved gets to take the first action there.  Two of the 3 pawns can only be in an area by themselves while the third is a disk you can place under either (or on its own) to give +1 to that pawn's influence total.

One of the couple unique mechanics in this game is that after placing workers the players choose which areas are resolved in turn order even if they don't themselves have a worker in that area.  This opens the game up for a little bit of screwage if a player needs the resources at one area to spend them at another for example.

The other interesting mechanic is the game's economy.  There are no actual monetary units in the game, instead you spend sets of the 5 different goods.  The more different goods you turn it at one time the more valuable the set is.

These two unique mechanics are enough to give the game a try but past that it is a pretty mediocre worker placement game with some really ugly sides.

There's not much substance to the game, you simply collect resources and turn them in (for titles usually).  The titles themselves aren't even very interesting in what they allow you to do and there aren't a whole lot of victory points to spread around which is something I'm not a fan of.

Now we come to the ugly.  This game has the worst typography I've ever seen.  I'm not just talking about in board games, I mean ever with my own eyes.  They chose to use this font for all the headings and labels on the board, rulebook, and other game elements that is English with these sort of Middle Eastern flourishes.  It is difficult to read and actually affects the game.  Even worse than that though is the miniscule writing on the title cards that are a huge part of the game.  I'm actually one of those people that doesn't mind small print and usually scoff at people that complain about it but the font is so small in this game some players literally could not read it.  All of this actually hurts the enjoyment of the game and if it weren't already so bland would make me not want to play it again anyway.

Has OK mechanics but is disconnected or has nothing to do with the theme. Just hate illogical things like the where a unique set of wares is much much more worth then an equal number of a single type of ware. Just doesn't make any sense. It's just the wrong mechanism for a trade theme. Artwork was good except for the Map (vry boring), and the fonts (unreadable) and color scheme (all the same same).

Another "place dudes to get stuff, then spend stuff to get powers+VP" game. Vaguely reminiscent of Maestro Leonardo.

For me, it suffered from two fundamental flaws:

In a 3-player game, everyone who goes to a location gets something. You might have to pay a bit more, or get a bit less, but the tension wasn't there. I guess this reservation would evaporate in a 4/5 player game.

[size=5]The typeface on tiles was so small that I had to remove my glasses to read it. This is a gaming first for me, and IMO pushes the game close to "broken".[/size]

Strategic majority game. Not my cup of tea, but it's perfectly balanced and a great choice for players that are in for a serious game and a real challenge.

RATING: 6
Some of the graphic design choices are comically bad, but once you print out some player aids it's no big deal. As for the game, I really liked it. The way goods are used as money is brilliant, and just creates all kinds of interesting decisions. Players choosing the order in which actions are resolved is also an inspired mechanic that really ratchets up the fear and screwage (it reminds me a tad of Vanuatu). My only complaint is that the game can be a little plodding, in part because of the variable turn order ("whose turn is it?"). If you have players committed to moving the game along it can be as engrossing as it is clever.

RATING: 9.1
I would give it a 10 were it not for the small font on the Offices tiles. Nothing groundbreaking in the way of mechanics, just familiar ones that all work well together. A medium weight Euro with excellent components and a playing time that doesn't outlast it's welcome. The rules are clear with good examples and the game is approachable by casual and hardcore gamers alike. There is a cutthroat element though it doesn't emerge as an overpowering or annoying strategy and there is a luck element that is balanced and controlled by the player to decide whether to engage that element or not. The theme could be considered pasted on but the history behind it is sound and researched. It just felt comfortable to play and afforded an element of fun without burning out my brain. It was "just right".

The Fifth Caliph of the Abbasid Dynasty in a reign of prosperity. Worker placement game with deterministic strategy.  Some screw-your-neighbor by activating an area first. Also a combat system. I like that there is a controlled use of randomness for spice. Guilds add a lot of depth once you learn the icons and how they work.

Ouch, my head was hurting after reading the rules of this game. As beautiful as the art of the components are, just as unreadable are the rules of this game. Also the chosen font and the size of it on the tiles, are making those pretty hard to read. Setting up the game for the first time is a tough job. The rules speak about Sages & Pashas, but you won’t find anywhere in the rulebook how they look. Ans so it goes with all the components. After we managed to set up the game, it was time to to play. Another tough job according to the rulebook. In real life, this game is very easy to play, once you understand the mechanics. Another big minor point, is the fact, that the prices on the card are almost impossible to read. This could be solved, by just printing a thin black line around the numbers.

This is a game that is, once understood, fun to play. But we wouldn’t recommend this one to anybody. The poor rulebook, the hard to read tokens, and the high pricing of the game combined together, makes this a game that just misses too much.

This game has lots of things going on: worker placement, area control, set collection, characters with powers, push your luck.

It is missing one thing, though: fun.

There's none of that.

When I woke up, I thought I had played Dominion without the awesome.

With that said, I think there's a game here... it's just that I haven't found it yet -- which is my problem entirely.

I felt the same way about Dominion at first... after buying and trading two copies away, I finally bought and own a third copy (and all expansions) and love it. Had I not given it many chances, I wouldn't ever have come to appreciate it.

I will exercise the same approach with this title.

This should be a great deck building game but numerous flaws and lazy artwork hold it back. The first hour of the game is a grind-fest as players try and struggle to improve their hands. After that a player will win a new flag ship and then that player will win. The problem being there is still probably a good hour or more left until that player grinds down the victory.

The artwork and general quality of the game is very poor and generally lazy. Instead of creating dedicated artwork they've merely screen grabbed images from the TV Show from what appears to be a warn out VHS copy judging by the quality.

There is something to recommend for fans of the show but they would need to be die hard fans to look past the many flaws.

Fun deck building game with awesome Trek-ness. There are definite design problems unfortunately. Run away winner is very pronounced, rule book makes the Borg variant confusing with certain card interactions, and to top it all off there is some very rough balance issues. (Fire all weapons is just not worth it usually and Shields are Worthless)

[2013-03-30] Most of all, it's an underwhelming game. I don't love it or even really like it, but I can't really hate it either. Feels very mechanical, with the theme not really being their besides a decoration (but then, I don't really care for Star Trek, so it doesn't matter to me).

[2013-09-04] I've played it again, and I more and more disliking the game. The biggest problem is its often just too long for what it is.

This game was interesting but seemed to suffer from a number of flaws. First of all it felt like there was a massive chance for a runaway leader. While the guys demoing the game assured us that in multiplayer you could gang up on the leader, I just didn't see that many opportunities for that kind of interaction. Then there is a massive luck factor in the mission deck. If you draw the wrong cards at the wrong time you can literally be destroyed 5 or 6 times in one game. Finally, and probably most importantly, the game just felt too long for what it is. I guess there are multiple ways to play, but the version we played felt very long and drawn out. We didn't quite reach the "official" end condition but when one player is 300 points ahead of the other, and the loser just got his ship destroyed for the 6th time it seems like a good time to stop.  Note: this is based on a single play of the prototype, and we were taught by some Bandai representatives.  I have no idea whether there have been changes made from what we played, or if all the rules were right.

RATING: 6
A mixed bag but a fun play. There's little design innovation here, as the subtitle "Deck Building Game" might imply! Also the rule book is a mess - there are several errata, unclear assumptions, and information that it just left to be assumed. Thematically it is peculiar that your "flagship" changes factions and your crew composition shifts arbitrarily. But as a deck builder, once you've muddled through the brief rules, it's a compelling game, and the three different game-play formats make for some variation. It's just not how I'd have made it!

This is my favorite solitaire/cooperative game. The competitive games, meh ... but the solo/coop game is genius!

*****************************************************

Played my first learning game tonight. I will wait until I play a few more games before I rank it. I like the deck building as you go mechanism and the ability to "thin" your deck as you go as well to concentrate the better cards you have acquired along the way. The rules are a little sparse, but I was able to figure out most of my questions through logic. 10-13-2011

Played my first Borg game last night. We also played a competitive game as well as sort of a learning game for the other party. The Borg cooperative game was a lot of fun. It took us a while because we could not upgrade our ships. By a while I mean 3 hours. I think this is easily overcome by starting each player with a random 25 point ship in addition to the special ability starting ship each player normally receives. I would like to see more co-op scenarios for this game. If the designers don't deliver, maybe we'll see some fan based content.

I played a couple of solo games last weekend using some ideas from the forum section. There is some real potential there too. 10-20-2011 AM

I increased my rating a tiny bit because the homebrew solo rules I have been messing with have been giving good solo play results. I posted them in the forum. 10-20-2011 PM

We played another Borg scenario with two players. Once again this was a lot of fun. I may be branded a heretic, but I think I like this particular scenario better than the LOTR deck building game. I continue to play with the solo rules for the standard game and recently played a solo game of the Borg scenario too. All good times! 12-23-11

Decent deckbuilding game: some high points, some low points. I like the theme, and the wildly various character you can recruit on to your ship. I like the missions, in general. But upgrading your ship is vital: do it early enough, and you should run away with the game.

I've only tried one alternate game mode: the Borg cooperative campaign. It wasn't even close: we were dead before we were even half way to the objective, if I remember correctly. I don't rate this high or low: it was a learning game, and I want cooperative games to be challenging. Just providing information, I guess.

I have never watched Star Trek, I know nothing about the characters or the history or the mythology of the Star Trek universe, but I still found this game to be pretty fun. It's very similar to the LOTR deckbuilding game, with a changing market and certain quests you have to defeat in order to score points. The downside to this mechanic (unlike DBGs with more stable market displays) is that luck plays a much larger role in the cards you're able to get into your deck. Nevertheless, as a light, thematic, non-strategic deck builder, it's not too bad.

I like the game and would like to play it a bit more. It adds some cool stuff to the Dominion-style deckbuilder and feels a heck of a lot more thematic, especially for the TNG geek in me. It could probably have used just a tad more streamlining and playtesting, but I'm hesitant to be too critical after one play. I may have to buy the Original Series game when it comes out.

A travesty. Random, swingy. Dominion is a game of surpassingly interesting strategy with few meaningful tactical decisions to make. Every other deckbuilding game released in its wake seems bound and determined to keep the tactics and make it nigh impossible to have a strategy, which makes for an exercise only slightly more interesting than Rock-Paper-Scissors. This is the worst offender I have encountered. The slapdash visual presentation just reinforces the idea that this was rushed to market by people who don't understand the first thing about deckbuilding games but are keenly aware that people will buy all manner of random schlock if it has a Starfleet logo on it. If I gave a rat's ass about Star Trek, I might further be irritated by the fact that the mechanics of the game make no sense in the context of the Star Trek mythos (at least as I understand it), but I'll leave that part up to the people who do give said rat's ass.

RATING: 7
This is my first deck building game so I have little reference to compare it to popular titles like Dominion. I am biased because I like Trek but this game is pretty good on mechanics and challenge. It also has three different scenarios, free-for-all exploration where you accumulate points. 

The theme for the most part makes sense as you acquire specific characters and abilities in your deck, but don't expect some sort of simulation quality to the theme, you will often have characters from different factions in your deck and certain Starship maneuvers have to be acquired (Shields, Warp Speed, Sensor Scans, Transporters) there's also the fact that your flagship is upgraded by persuading the other ship to join you through your diplomatic abilities.

On the whole it works, the game's pace could be improved a bit, but I'm sure this is due mostly to lack of gaming experience on the participants. Familiarity with the rules and the deck will speed up play, but the learning curve is likely less harsh than say Race for the Galaxy (Where it's absolutely vital to know what kind of high scoring cards you can combine your other cards with).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
Pro -

- fun mechanics. similar to Dominion in flow/thinking (aka youll catch on quick) but with combat, events and missions.
- tons of varied cards to build your deck unicity that keeps things interesting.
- Great theme.
- 3 different games types for co-op (Borg), versus (Exploration), team play (Klingon Civil War)
- quick action and not much down time once everyone is on the same page
- really high replay value, for me (not super into them), for a DBG

Con (Huge) -

- horrid literature for learning the game. so many important facets of the game arent explained specifically or exampled. online tutorials are a must.

I played the demo of this game at the 2011 Las Vegas Star Trek convention and knew I would buy it as soon as it was released. After dozens of plays, it is one of my favorite games! I like the Klingon Civil War scenario. It is more balanced and a little faster paced than exploration. The deck building works well and the Star Trek theme really comes out.

RATING: 7
This is actually a pretty neat DBG; there is a ton of variety thanks to the bajillion different cards and the different scenarios, there is space combat between the deck and the other players, you can upgrade your ship and crew, and there are a bunch of different currency that thematically make the game interesting (diplomacy, attack, shields, speed).

Some of the screencaps for the cards are of poor resolution though, and the way the starbase cards are laid out, there's a lot of randomness that makes it hard to use any sort of real strategy.  Still, it's a pretty neat game if you like Star Trek and/or deck builders.

Tentative rating after 1 play of an everyone-for-himself game. I like the concept, but the execution just didn't work right. Too much chaos in the exploration deck results in a rich-get-richer effect when players acquire new ships, while others get hosed by Q. Plus, the game just takes too long.

I'd be willing to give it another shot, and at least try the team game and cooperative game.

Feels like a mix between Thunderstone and Ascension (as several other have already stated). Too bad they didn't use the best parts of each game.

The card text is awfully small and hard to read from a distance which makes it impossible to see what the other persons are doing during their turns. How hard can it be to make readable cards with good iconography?

I'm not too fond of the search ability either (you may discard card from the market or whatever it is called). This only leads to all good card that you can't afford yourself to get discarded.

Finally, the randomness of the explore action sounds like a good idea, but it fails to be fun for me at least. One player explores and finds an awesome ship that he easily defeats and the next guy meets some impossible one and gets crushed. The next round the first guy has this ship with +4 on all stats and blazes through the game while the other ones still get unlucky draws and get nowhere.

Doesn't help I'm not a trekkie either I guess, quite bland card art.

If you decide to play this game, you'd better be a huge fan of the theme, because there's a lot to make up for.  The rules are poorly written, the typeface on the cards is too small, and there is no clear visual distinction between the different classes of cards.  If that weren't bad enough, the game makes liberal use of the "whack the leader" concept.  And it is way too long for what it is.  I thought it was horrible.

I'm just a sucker for deck building games and here is another really good one.

Improve your starship's bridge to capture a bigger & better spaceship in order to defeat  outer space enemies and the other players. 

Like other games in the  genre, player's start with the same base hand,  buy and upgrade.   There is also an explore Outer Space similar to Resident Evil's explore the Mansion.  and the available buys are similar to  Ascension's where a variety of singular cards are for purchase .   A mix of the genre, yet feels new and refreshing.

A good amount of interaction.  Some card text, but not overwhelming.  A co-op version we didn't play looks interesting.  Hopefully it plays fast because players can die and leave the game.   Like Resident Evil there is also a Team version.

Interesting death penalty--junk up your hand with lowly 
ensigns.

Some are enthralled with the strong theme.  It's immaterial to me--the mechanics of play are all I care about.  There is a logical  fighting mechanic where the ship with the most speed strikes first.  

The box: Obviously designed for many future expansions.  Although we are adults playing, cards bend easily--one of them during shuffling!  I was forced to sleeve--the fit in the box is snug.  Very disappointed there are NO badly needed indexes. 
 
All who played the game liked it.  Can't wait to play this again--soon--and it is going to get a lot of play!

[u]Deck Building Games--My order[/u]

[b]Star Trek[/b] (After 1 play, on top--new sweetheart for the moment)
[b]Resident Evil[/b] (I love this game, but harder to get to the table than Nightfall, Ascension, Quarriors!, or Puzzle Strike).
[b]Nightfall[/b] (Easy to get to the table.  Not enamored with the Martial Law Expansion)
[b]Puzzle Strike[/b] (Every time I play this, I enjoy it more than I think I will.)
[b]Dominion[/b] (this tumbles with the expansions)
[b]Thunderstone[/b] (I like this game, but hard to get to the table.)
[b]Ascension[/b] (Others bring it to the table frequently)
[b]Quarriors![/b] (Others like this one better than I)
[b]Heroes of Graxia[/b] (Going to sell)

(Have yet to play A Few Acres of Snow or Eminent Domain.)

Edit:  So far this game does take longer than the other deck building games.  If playing with newbies, best to reduce the win points required, to 250 or 300.

One play of the exploration game. It went on far, far, far too long, but that might have been because three of the four of us were applying a Dominion mentality to a game that's not Dominion.

Another deck building game that copies other deck building games, without any new ideas.

It has the same basic problem of "Thunderstone": the encounter deck is just shuffled, so that harder starships and missions may appear in the beginning of the game, and easier ones in the end. It's even worse because, although you may have one or two missions on display, most of the time you are just blindly flipping a random card from the deck and hoping you can beat it. Sometimes you get a random benefit or is harmed by an event (much like treasures and traps in "Thunderstone"). The hugest flaw is that a player will often run away with the game if he is lucky to get a new flagship early and the others don't get theirs soon.

On the theme, the card powers make sense, but no thought has been given beyond that. You battle or "diplomacy" Federation, Klingon, Ferengi, Romulan and Cardassian ships alike, and even fight other players for no reason. You can have any of those ships as your flagship, and a mix of characters from all factions, with the Enterprise crew scattered among several players. Or you can even have Picard and the entire crew, and be attacked by the Enterprise! I really wanted a thematic experience, but it's all a disjointed mess.

It's nice that there are two scenarios to play besides the standard exploration game, but they are so poorly developed that they feel like an afterthought. The Klingon Civil War is a tedious succession of battles between two teams. The Borg Invasion, a cooperative scenario, scales terribly with the number of players (practically impossible to win with two), and many card powers simply don't work with it.

I found the game fairly fun at first, made quite an effort to like it and even to fix it, but the extreme randomness and lazy implementation of theme continued to annoy me. I would be hesitant to recommend this game even to die-hard "Star Trek" fans, and anyone else shouldn't touch it.

It is also noteworthy that it has one of the worst rulebooks I have ever read.

This feels a lot like a themed version of Dominion, except with the added mechanic of space battles. The battles themselves are pretty simple (they're just state comparison > lower stats lose). 

There are a few ways to play this game, and we've only tried the 2 player competitive version. 

We definitely bought this game for the theme (we play while watching TNG). It's fun for us, but I don't think non-TNG fans will be very happy with their purchase.

I appreciate that someone wants to make a more interactive deck building game, but this one really fell flat for me.  I think the biggest problem was the battles, which bring the game to a screeching halt. The game also includes an element of risk in flipping over cards from the deck--this, too, is something of an interesting idea, but since there's a pretty wide variety of cards in there and you essentially lose your turn if it doesn't work out, it's not really well-balanced.  The game also felt a little "loose" in the sense that it lets you do too many things with your hand, but maybe I'm just used to Dominion. (1 play)

Buenísimo... Specially for all the trek heads of the world! Would like to play it more, but my gamers buddies don't like it as much as I do. Shame on them! Also owned all the expansions. Típico DBG al que se le añade una mecánica de exploración para enfrentar misiones espaciales. Juego competitivo que gana el primero que alcance 400 puntos al superar las misiones. El juego está prácticamente dividido en dos partes: en la primera uno aquiere del Starfleet deck las maniobras y los personajes (Data, Crusher, Riker, etc) que le den mayor fuerza a tu crew para luego enfrentar las misiones; en el segundo uno enfrenta misiones y eventos.

A great game for fans of deck building and especially ST:TNG.  Far more interactive than Dominion, for instance.  The unique character cards add a lot of flavour to the game, and the 3 distinct scenarios give the game lots of re-playability, with various cards becoming more (or less) valuable in each scenario.

The cooperative Borg scenario is especially popular with my significant other (also a trekkie, and a big fan of co-ops like Pandemic).  She especially likes working together to defeat Borg cubes and helping each other rid our ships of Borg intruders.  Our only complaint is that the coop scenario can take several hours with only 2 players (easier and quicker with 3-4).

We haven't tried the Klingon team-play scenario yet.

RATING: 6
A deck building game based on Star Trek universe. The game is a classic deck building game with several cards on the table and every turn you can buy this or that card for increasing your deck force and quality. After that, by gathering a crew, you will try to complete missions in order of wining more points that the other players. It is not a bad game, but it has some flaws that makes that it is not one of my favorite games. The biggest issue, for me, is the "ship factor". For attempting a mission you need to have certain values in different abilities, those numbers are obtained by adding the crew's abilities to the ship, and the ships, except for the initial one, are always overpowered and they provide points at every area. You may fail several times until being able of changing the spaceship, but if one player is able to change the ship at an early turn of the game, be sure that the game is probably finished as the abilities of the ship cannot be matched by characters until late in the game.
Positive:
1. It is quite thematic
2. I enjoy a lot the deck building mechanic
3. There are some scenarios that can be played
Negative:
1. The "ship" factor kills the game
2. I think that it is a bit long

Love this game! I have played this game for hours, and it never gets old. I did however have to edit the rules a bit to keep it fair and interesting. I didn't like how the Federation could not attack first, nor that you could not mix your decks without a treaty. Modifying this greatly improved game play for me.

RATING: 6
Not sure what to make of this game after one play.  It is an interesting take on the deck building plus combat concept, with the ST:TNG license for good measure.  However, my opponent got out to a big lead and never looked back, so I would want to play it again to see if that was a fluke or if runaway leader is really a problem.  Plus there are apparently a couple of different ways to play, which might be interesting to explore--especially the cooperative rules.

The exploration scenario is not unlike a cross between Ascension and Thunderstone. Some of the cards are extremely well themed, like the simple Transporter (return a card from your discard pile to your hand) and the infuriating Lwaxana Troi (force opponents to discard one card for each card of a certain cost you name - name 5 in the late game and this wrecks opponents' hands). Others are sort of blah. Riker has some sort of discard effect - what? Also - how is it that Jean-Luc Picard can be in the same deck with some random Ferengi and Sela the Romulan, while a different deck might have Commander Riker and Klingon Chancellor Gowron? How is that supposed to work thematically?

Unfortunately the search mechanic keeps most of the interesting cards out of the game. This mechanic allows each player to banish a card from the game on their turn. So just before my turn Jean-Luc Picard might come up. I can barely even read the text on the card from across the table, but he's Jean-Luc Picard and therefore awesome. If I can't buy him right then, I banish him. We rarely saw any powerful cards because they would always be preemptively banished.

The exploration deck is also high variance, and that's a problem for game balance. On my turn I might flip a small starship on which I am able to perform a diplomacy action, thus securing a few points and a permanent upgrade. Then on your turn you might flip the Enterprise which is too powerful to take over, so it damages you. Or you draw a mission you can't defeat, or Q who blows up your ship in a fit of pique. The early ship upgrades seem to be very powerful, which is a problem because getting them is not a matter of skill.

There's potential here - the exploration deck is a neat idea if too swingy. And the starting hands are well built - some decent cards are available at the beginning giving a more satisfying ramp up than in, say, Dominion. But I'm having a tough time seeing past the thematic inconsistencies and the balance.

If I'm able to try the Borg or Klingon Civil War scenarios my rating could go up a little, if they are well designed. The exploration scenario doesn't really work for me.

Great light deck building game, that is a lot of fun when you take into account the luck factors and just enjoy the theme and game. The mechanics are well done, although the luck of the draw in upgrading your flagship seems to be a problem. 

I've played 6 times now, and enjoy it more and more with each play. Still have yet to try the Borg and Klingon decks. Looking forward to future expansions.

I want to like this game, I really do. I love Dominion, I love Star Trek -- so mixing the two should be great. But the result is a very long and slow game that seems heavily luck based. Without deck cycling and the stark disparity between the cards granting the ability to buy cards (XP) and do something useful (everything else), it feels haphazard. The missions likewise are extremely unpredictable in how points ended up handed out, and the volatility and length of the game make it rather an unpleasant experience. Perhaps I'll change my mind with more plays...

The game, itself, is quite good. I like that the Starbase/marketplace is bigger in size than Star Realms but also keeps changing as you cycle through the cards. This adds an extra layer of strategy, especially if you know what cards your opponent likes to use. 

Can't stop humming the theme while playing. Can't stop from blurting out catch phrases and lines from the show.

Not as strategic as many other deck building games, but definitely one of the best with direct interaction among players, and probably the most thematic of the bunch. As a ST fan I really appreciated feeling like I was in the universe that Picard, Worf, and Data inhabit. Using diplomacy to take over a new flagship is one of the most rewarding feelings in Deck Building Games I have experienced. When you take control of the bridge on the U.S.S. Enterprise, or a Kligon Bird of Prey you really get a sense of accomplishment.

There seems to be some question as to how thematic the game is. I find the characters, in the stats and powers they have to be very much so. The random encounters deck, much like Thunderstones', also befits the theme.

The issue I have is play time. It needs to be MUCH faster otherwise even the theme cannot save it. I would also like to test the hypothesis that the first to get a ship wins; I do not believe that to be true.

Update:

While still as luck driven as Thunderstone's dungeon deck, the exploration deck NEVER screws you even when someone can benefit greatly from lucky draws. Then again, the person who explores the most will win. It's an interesting push your luck element that I enjoy. 

The play time also came down to 40 minutes! 

Finally, two players got ships early and one of them won. Yes you must get a ship to win. Yes you should learn to build your deck well to get one. No it's not "broken" like the forums intimate.

I'm going to keep playing it :) Rating rises to a 7.

The rulebook is among the worst I've ever read, but the cards look fantastic, the box is well-designed (though the glued-in insert is a bit strange), and the Borg invasion scenario is a lot of fun. I haven't tried the vanilla game (which sounds too much like their Resident Evil DBG, which I hated) or the battle scenario (which I've heard is okay but not great).

The fluid turns and group ur-turn took some getting used to, but once we got rolling we found lots of synergies and plenty of enjoyment in this structure. "Diplomacying" friendly or enemy starships to take them over doesn't feel right, but apart from that there's lots of love for canon and the feel of Star Trek in this game.

Game one with the Borg scenario took about two hours, which was a bit too long but also a first game. I suspect future games will go much more quickly, and everyone enjoyed it.

Game two...never happened. I'd rather play all sorts of things than play this again, so I sold it.

A great coop vs. board dbg. The PVP can get one sided quickly if you don't play the game often enough to know the cards.

Box Insert: The box is way too big, but they put one permanent divider in the center and they give you foam blocks to separate cards and fill space. 4/10, It's not good at all, but it isn't the worst (looking at you Munchkin).

seemed like way too large an amount of different characters which limits it accessibility.  the base actions seemed decent and deck building function worked and was somewhat interesting.   i was put off by the large amount of character cards with gobs of different text abilities.   font choice for everything seemed poor (which seems like an odd complaint, but i think it was a pretty big drawback).   

seemed to have runaway issues caused by fluky starship acquisition.  some missions seemed really unbalanced.  maybe if you had a better idea of what missions might be near the top of the deck, it would be easier to gauge.

i might could get talked into playing again with 2 players, but even then i see little reason to go back unless i notice a geekbuddy strongly advocating.  with higher player counts, i would expect the game to really bog with all the "take that" character abilities and war/battle calculations.

Rating based on a single play - base scenario with several expansions and promos.  By the end several of us were just longing for it to be over.

This is the personal favorite in my list of deck-building games, slightly in front of Thunderstone; right now my wife and I can´t stop playing it; 3 different scenarios, which play completely different; cool ways to handle the cards and tweak your deck perfectly; we played 10+ games now and believe me, you´ll get a good feeling for adjusting the chaos you feel, when you play the game for the first few times; not to forget: WE DON´T ARE TREKKIES, BUT LOVE TO SEE THE NEXT GENERATION TV SERIES; take my rating down, if you don´t like that ...

Admittedly I've only played the Explorations scenario twice, but even so, this game got off to a rough start what with the rulebook hiding critical rules in the Q&A section at the back.  Also "Diplomacy" is not a verb, dammit.

It took upwards of three hours to finish.

Cards are very thin and prone to bending.

Second game went better, but we were still correcting mistakes caused by unclear rules.  I have a pet peeve about games that make it difficult to determine if they are being played properly.  This separate group had played it three times before and got a different set of rules wrong.

Nice adaption of the Dominion deck building system.  Good adaption of ST:TNG.  Actually has a bit of the feel of being in the Star Trek universe.

Game play is similar to Dominion but the decks are bigger and cards are not set (you get to replace one card per turn for free from the tableau from the draw deck).  Also have missions to complete that score points to win the game.

Can be played free for all (base game), coop (vs. the Borg), or against each other (Klingon civil war).

Takes a lot longer to play than Dominion.  Those not familiar with Star Trek take longer to pick up nuances of cards that others familiar with the genre know just by the title of the card or the picture.

After multiple test plays with house rules me and my son have finally gotten this game to what we consider a playable experience.
We didn't like the fact that all the factions could mix unrestricted so we have each player start off with one of the 25pt star ships. This declares their faction and gives everyone a bit of an up in starting ability which speeds things up. When purchasing characters from spacedock, if you want to buy a character that doesn't match your faction you have to pay an additional 2xp. We also removed the free Search everyone has each turn because everyone just searched away any character that wasn't their faction so you rarely got anyone.
Faster games and more theme = win for us.

RATING: 5
This deckbuilding game uses a drafting mechanic, but doesn't have any sort of sliding cost scale, so bad cards tend to accumulate in the draft pool.  The game is more like Thunderstone than Dominion in that money is good only up to a point; what you really want is high-powered cards that you can use to beat baddies from the baddie deck.  The main flaw of the game is that the baddie deck is completely random and you just flip the top card, so you have absolutely no idea whether you'll get something you can beat, something that totally kicks your butt, something that you can't do but someone else can later, or something that just gives you some sort of bonus.  So trying your luck there is too risky for the majority of the game, but it's really the only way to advance it.

RATING: 5
Theme obviously abounds in this game.  The basic mechanics are sound, feeling very much like Dominion with the added objective of completing missions.  The problems with this game are how bogged down the randomness of the space deck can get.  The game only accelerates once players begin to gain enough diplomacy to take over ships and permanently increase your flagship stats.  That can take a long time some games.  I don't think I've had a game last less than three hours yet.  A deck building game should not last that long.  Also, the rule book for this game is a complete mess.  I had to watch a video online just to figure out how to resolve a multi-player battle because it was very unclear how a player could obtain those points.  What about ties in battle?  Not listed at all in the rules.  I like this game enough to play it once every so often, but it's a shame that it was not done just a little better because this could have been a great game.

Yet another deckbuilding game. This time its hook is the "Star Trek" theme, which is well implemented, but not enought to catch the attention of people that knows the genre. The original contribution of the game is the combat system, based on multiple stats, which is nice, but not that much of a deal to make room for this design among the greatest of this kind of games. It plays something like a mix between "Ascension" and "Resident Evil".

The game is a bit wonky in that some of the cards seem unbalanced (too many victory points for doing too little, giving a person easily, etc).   Also, there is a real runaway leader possibility in the games. The first person to upgrade his starship has a definite advantage.  On the upside, the game provides nice ways to control your deck by getting rid of unwanted cards and routinely upgrading.  I like that sort of control.  A little bit like Thunderstone in space with a little Ascension mixed in.

I dislike the implementation of the different stats, and I hated the random event cards. Combat felt arbitrary and stupid. Felt like Ascension crossed with Arkham Horror, but with all of the fun in Ascension stripped out.

Some fun here for Star Trek fans, but the theme feels off when a player encounters and then blows up the Enterprise. The importance of upgrading your ship, and the amount of luck involved in this, make this game a little unbalanced and frustrating.

I really liked this game but I seemed to be the only one at the table that did. For the rest of the group it was far too long for what it was. I agree to a point, and think that it would have been much better as a three player game (we were playing five). I think I'll rate it higher after another play. I'm pretty sure it's not coming out again with that group and I'm reluctant to buy it until I find other people who will play it with me.

RATING: 4
Far too long and - especially for a game that long - far too random. After playing 3+ hours someone wins because he got the right cards from the space deck.

As a fan of Star Trek I did like how (many of) the cards transport the theme (within the confines of the game mechanics).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Great theme, but horrible theme play.  Takes a few plays to learn the game thanks to an awful rulebook.  However, the game is not difficult to play.  Cannot play a faction like the Federation, Klingons & etc., end up with a mixed crew of many factions on your ship.  Game play is so-so, disappointing.  Components fair at best - cards durable with fuzzy 'TNG screen shot' artwork , but rulebook was not well written.  Game length a bit long, seems to drag.

RATING: 7
Only played the game twice, once using the free for all variant, once the co-op borg attack rules. The co-op game was great, if a little easy. 
 
 The free for all seemed a bit unbalanced. The two players lucky enough to get a new ship early on ran away with the game, with the other two of us struggling to catch up. Once the player on my right got a better ship I died every time the war card came out. 
 
 Enjoyed it though (the theme helps) and will definately give it a couple more plays before deciding one way or t'other. probably not good enough to make me interested in deck building games generally.

RATING: 3
Awful, awful, disaster of a game. Lots of icons and numbers that aren't interesting. Basic game is barely playable. Co-op variant is atrocious; draw streams of bad cards with nothing you can do about it. Klingon Civil War is insanely loaded toward "rich get richer".

I like the theme of course.  My first game was the coop against the Borg and we lost.  I'd say it was mostly my fault as I was new to the game and didn't thin my deck properly.

I might rate this higher with further plays. But as I stumbled into a game at GameStorm, and it was so long it kept me from playing a game of Innovation, I have to lower my opinion of it.  Seriously, I could have played at least 3 games of Dominion in the time it took to play this.  I hope it would quicken in the future.

Call this one a near miss. This has all the engaging theme that Dominion lacks, and Star Trek fans will appreciate the rich theme. However, while the game mechanics work pretty well, this one has a lot of flaws, as well. The type size in the rule book is the smallest I've ever seen for a full-sized game like this, but they didn't use the extra space well as many basic rules are unclear or completely unanswered in the rules. I also dislike that the game is so geared toward leader-bashing, apparently to make up for some balance issues. A chief flaw is that the game takes a bit longer than it should and is very text-heavy, which further slows the proceedings. Everything felt just a bit clunky rather than polished. The theme will save this for some folks, but for me there's too many deck-building games that I really enjoy (including Thunderstone and Core Worlds) to keep this interesting but flawed offering.

Surprisingly deep and immerseive deck-building game set in the TNG universe.  Excellent use of variable missions, powers, and mechanics.

Tough to get your deck boot-strapped, but there is a lot of content here and a well thought out execution.  Art style is wonderful, and the game does great work with the overall license and feel.

The multiplayer co-op vs the Borg is awesome :)

Some of this works well and is nicely thematic. But it has problems. One is that it takes quite a while - our four-player exploration game took two hours, which is too long to be playing this game. A bigger problem, as noted by many other people, is the way you get better ships by "diplomacy-ing" ships in the space deck. This is unbalanced and not at all thematic, especially since you might end up with a Federation crew flying a Cardassian or Ferengi ship.

I was hoping that the expansion would do something more sensible, like provide better Federation ships that could be purchased with mission points. Since it doesn't, I won't be buying this and probably won't play it very much more.

Quite honestly the worst game I've played in a while. It basically took all the worst aspects of other deckbuilding games and put them all together in one giant pile of suck. It's longer than Thunderstone, has the awkward player-targeting effects of Nightfall, and runs with a deck of unique cards like Ascension, only worse. To top it off it has a bunch of forced catch-up mechanics and an almost Munchkin-like endgame.

Essentially, this game is only barely not broken. There are a lot of aspects that just don't mesh well, scoring and conditions were not thought out or tested properly for the number of players the game claims it plays, etc. If you played with 5, it would quite literally only be barely possible for the game to even end at all. The general theming is no stronger than Dominion (which is to say, basically non-existent), though I'm told the character theming was pretty good (I am not well acquainted with Trek).

I assume the co-op and team games are less terrible, but I believe they can't be enough better to be worthwhile.

I actually liked the game most of the time. But a few really huge game changing lucky draws and an awful runaway leader brings the rating down. As a co-op this could really shine. And extra plus for theme!

Ick.  This has all the worst parts of [gameid=36218] with dryness and overwhelming choice, combined with the worst of [gameid=69789] with scripted turns, and the worst of [gameid=53953] with the luck factor and sometimes impossible hands.  Throw in a huge helping of randomness, and an extremely long game length, and you have a real stinker of a deck-building game on your hands.  This game is just riddled with holes.  There are lots of nods to the franchise, and if you are a diehard fan, I can see getting excited by the reference, as well as a pretty well-executed scenario system relative to how dry this is.  That aside this will frustrate people looking for a better game enough that it won't matter. What a waste of a good franchise.

I'm not sure if this is a game that will work better for folks who are already familiar with the show, but for those of us who were never into Star Trek, the game is just an abstract game of shuffling cards and doing things with particular stats.  Parts of it are fine -- the way that the cards can be used for different parts of the game at the same time is pretty nifty, and there's a neat balance between conquering ships and "Diplomacying" them -- but it slogs on, and takes a lot longer than I would expect, even for a learning game where we played a key rule incorrectly for half of the game.  I mean, 3+ hours for a game like this is, frankly, ridiculous.  Even if we had played the key rule correctly, we only would have shaved about half the time off the game.

Players take on the role of Captain of a salvaged Starship. They will search for new allies such as Picard, Data, and other famous Characters. They will Explore space to complete Missions, Encounter Events, and meet Starships that could be friend or foe.
\13\\13\
The game will feature 3 separate scenarios of play:
\13\\13\
Explorations (Free For All): Explore Space to complete Missions, Encounter Events, and Engage Starships.
Borg Invasion (Cooperative): The Borg have come to Assimilate you and everything you know. Band together with your fellow Captains to defend your world and fend off the Borg.
\13\\13\
Klingon Civil War (Teams): A rift in power has been created in the Klingon Empire. Form an alliance, gather support, and defeat your enemies to obtain control of the Empire.
\13\\13\
The goal of each game varies. While some simply require a point threshold, another game's goal might be to simply survive.

The Star Trek Deck Building game is an unholy union of Dominion and Ascension. Game play takes the basic flow and turn structure from the former and the random and unpredictable drafting pool from the latter. Technically it works, but quite frankly, I think that the Star Trek license is a poor fit for the game's mechanics. Basically, you spend crew like money to buy action cards and more crew. You can mix and match different characters from different eras and while their card effects usually more or less make sense, there is very little cohesiveness between the cards. I'm not really sure I want to say that the game stinks or that it's not any fun, because I think there is a decent game here. I just don't think it feels like Star Trek, which to me is very disappointing.

Like everyone says, a mix of Dominion, Thunderstone, Nightfall, and Ascension as far as deckbuilding.  But, what I like about this one is the themed scenarios that you can play outside of just the Exploration (basic competitive) mode.  The co-op Borg Invasion scenario is pretty tense while the team-based Klingon Civil War adds the co-op/competitive edge.  The Exploration mode does leave a little to be desired in that the Space Deck (random encournters) is a bit limited with the variety of Events and there is no bonus or penalty for mixing factions/ships (ex. Federation personnel serving about a Ferengi ship with Romulan characters).  Exploration is just a mechanical game rather than a Star Trek TNG themed one... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
[Based on one play of the exploration scenario.]

"Luck of the draw" doesn't even begin to describe it here. 
It's like playing Thunderstone with no dungeon hall, and blindly attacking the monster on top of the deck. If you're lucky and have exactly what you need to get through, well done! If not -- better luck next time.
And drafting cards from the middle is about just as random. If you have the resources you need for the powerful card that just popped up, well done! If not, stop worrying about it: one of your opponents will either buy it or cycle it out of the game by the time it's your turn again.

Ugh.

Our first deck building game. Being Star Trek TNG fans we got this for the theme and it proved to be a lot of fun. 

We tend to enjoy extending the victory points to at least 700 when playing, otherwise it ends to quick and you do not get to enjoy the best cards you spent time to get.

Just an excellent deck building with some extra mechanics. Very solid Star Trek atmosphere. The biggest surprise of this year.

love this game, I score high too because my wife loves it, one of her favorites. I like the deck building and the multiple modes of play available. love the Klingon Civil are team moide and the team versus the Borg, difficult. Great time. First game my wife taught to someone else other than me (on her own). Great stuff.

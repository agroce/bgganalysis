Played this back in the day, and it was a good solitaire game although a little on the fiddly side. For me at least though, it's been superseded to a certain extent by DVG's excellent remake, but been given a new lease on life with the Cyberboard module from www.toposolitario.com/cyberboard.

On the basis of reacquainting myself with HL with a 3-day Central America campaign (see session reports), I've increased my rating from 9 to 10 - it is a truly excellent solitaire game.

RATING: 6.5
Nice solitaire wargame of modern aviation warfare from an operational standpoint. Very interesting perspective that you don't see in many games. Can be a bit heavily dependent on the dice but from an operational perspective it works since your job is to factor in the possible bad luck so you can still come away with a successful mission. Still, it can be tough if not impossible to beat some of the missions when confronted with some of the random events that can come up especially with some of the tougher campaign settings.

A very nice solitaire game.  You are given a mission and some parameters, and then you outfit your hornets with weaponry.  You have to choose between loading for air-to-air combat, taking out anti-air defensese (both traditional and missile), and directly attacking the target.  Random events can help/hurt.

A very good solitaire effort, the rules are pretty clear and gaming is well paced.

The campaign opens up new possiblities.  You have more control over how many hornets fly, but you then have to worry about pilot fatigue.  It is a lot of fun, as pilots have different characteristics, some are great in air-to-air, some are bombers, etc. so there are mroe chocies in outfitting the planes.

Negatives: Although the rules are clear, there are a lot for a game of this length.  You have to play without the 'two failed missions is an aut-defeat' rule in the campaign game, the game is just too variable.  Finally, although fun, There is no real strategic or super tactical nuance.  I haven't played the computer version, like many solitaire games, I suspect that the computer version may have advantages.

RATING: 7
Based on one play thus far.  Game itself appears to be good, but the support aids could have been better.  Unlike Thunderbolt/Apache Leader, there is no detailed sequence of play which, for a game like this, is very helpful.  More plays may change my rating, but this one is not as much fun as its successor.

Cute solitaire game of F-18 missions.  As with most solo wargames, it suffers from being more dependent on die-rolling than on decision-making, but it's not entirely without interesting choices.  It's certainly more of a game than, say, B-17.  On the plus side are a decent variety of missions and events as well as a quick play time.

Without exception, one of the most intense solitaire games ever designed. You assign pilots, aircraft, weapons loads, ingress and egress routes, fight MiGs, AAA, SAM sites and a host of unexpected events. Your  pilots become fatigued, aircraft damaged and the missions get harder; but they must still be flown! You can almost roleplay this game as you become attached to your pilots. This game can become an emotional experience!

You are the commander of a wing of F/A-18 Aircrafts, missions are random, you need to plan how many aircrafts to do the mission, choice pilots, weapons, you also will got some random events, good or worse will depend on your luck. The game flow is smooth. A little bit boring, due to no interaction between players. You can only intereacted with a 10-side-die, it should be what solitaire game should be.

Nice solitaire game that allows you to bomb a problem country of your choice with a squadron of F-18s.  Mission generation is card driven in a system similar to that used in RAF.  The heart of the game is in the mission planning and execution:  which of your planes will attack the enemy radar, which will fight off enemy aircraft, and you might want to have somebody bomb the target, too.  Initially entertaining, and a friend of mine who is knowledgeable on such things informs me that it is reasonably insightful, but I found that the excitement level quickly wore off due to the sameness of the missions.  There is little difference in the game between bombing a bridge, attacking a military formation, or attacking ships.  For this reason, I ultimately preferred the game's sequel, Thunderbolt/Apache Leader.  In that game, I get a better sense of the targets that I am attacking (and more satisfaction when they are destroyed).

A very big BHA....horrible graphic even for its days, sluggish game play with all those cards, chits and everything else to keep constantly in your sight, while a leaner design could have produced a much more enjoyable game (as B17 Queen of the sky, for example). It's a very nice idea but very badly realized. Rules are more than vague and obscure with missing references almost anywhere that force you to guess how to play. Over-over rated

RATING: 9
One of my personal favorite solitaire games.  Play centers more around the command of an F-18 Hornet squadron than the details of flying the aircraft (the pilots of the squadron are assumed to be fully trained professionals, and capable of flying their aircraft competently).  Very fun and enjoyable, like all Leader-series games.

Fun game that gives the feel of air-to-air or air-to-ground combat without the stick and rudder detail of many other air power games.  In some ways it's like being the squadron commander and telling your pilots what to do more than being a pilot yourself.

Glad to see this made the jump from just Hornets to other aircraft types and other eras.

Definitely less than stellar components for a nice game which is a little bit too abstract looking and too "old" in pure design.

RATING: 8
One of the great solitaire wargames. Terrific structure: 30 minutes missions that can be squeezed into a busy schedule, yet still be part of a much larger campaign experience. Very fond memories of playing this in the early/mid-90's. Never finished a Tour of Duty of 3 campaigns; I think airframe attrition eventually caught up with me, forcing short-handed attacks on the big missions. This might be a "9" if the rules had been less choppy. In the pre-web era, solving rules questions was vastly more trouble than today. 

Opening the box today (2011), I see that I copied and hand-colored four black and white Campaigns (Yugoslavia, Southern Africa, Cuba, China). These must have been printed in the old "Inside GMT" newsletter. Kids these days are spoiled with their fancy C3I inserts...

To me this remains a true classic.
I very galdly pull it out again from time to time for either a campaign or just a single mission.
After more than 10 years not playing it, I picked it up and after 1 game I was again fully proficient.
I cannot compare to the new version, yet from what I have seen and understood, one of the great things of the old version (pilots and plane are separate) has been lost...

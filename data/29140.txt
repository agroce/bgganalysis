This is a quaint game and fun from time to time.
But it is too simple to be taken as anything more than a "filler's filler".

RATING: 4
A simple (but difficult to master) dexterity game.  The dice pick up a good deal of speed as they tumble down the "staircase".  Since you have little control over the value on the dice, winning depends on luck more than skill (given equally skilled opponents).  It's okay for passing time at a party with non-gamers, but when it comes to filler games (and dexterity games), there are many others that I would prefer to own and play.

COMPONENT NOTES:  It may be called "Junior", but it still takes up a lot of storage space (~1 cu.ft.) for a fast filler game.  Marketing this for 2 players was a foolish idea, why not use mini dice and market it for up to 4 players.

I cannot image that this game was the most played over the holidays. It's a great kids game, adult game and drinking game. All rolled into one. It takes skill, effort and lil luck to win. But it was the biggest hit at the house. I can't give it a bigger recomendation than get this game!

Fun little game, perfect for a filler.  It's size makes it hard to port around however, so this detracts from its rating.

Mini Tumblin' Dice...  it's Awesome Junior!  Smaller version is great to play while seated.  Perfect size for two player games.

RATING: 8
When I first saw this game, I thought it was the dumbest idea for a dexterity game I'd ever seen.  Then Funagain had it on sale for $10 and I thought I'd give it a try.  I was surprised to find that we love this game!  I'm amazed that this concept can work so well.  My kids and I have a great time together with this quick game that's a blast to play (and has a bit of a mathy component - bonus!).  Now I'd love to try the larger version.  Highly recommended!

Prefer the full sized Tumblin Dice over this one; but the Jr version is easier to carry and plays well enough with 2-3 players.

Regular sized dice are too big for the Jr version of this game.  Go get yourself 3 sets(allows for 3 players) of 12mm dice.  The smaller dice fit the smaller(Jr) sized board better. 
Since the Jr version is set up for 2 players only we upped the number of dice from 4 each to 6 dice for each player.  When playing with 3 players we cut the dice back to 4 though.

I did like the big version a little better for the bigger playing field and added players but I have an idea I want to try for this one below. The big version was expensive and BIG to store so this variant below might be a good option.  


Best thing to do is grab a set of 5 or 6 different coloured mini dice with 8 in each set. 

2 players = 6 to 8 dice each.  

3 players = 5 or 6 dice each

4 players = 3 or 4 dice each

5 players = 3 dice each

roughly 15 mini dice per turn in play should work good


Note I have not tried the small dice yet, the big ones do work good with the pegs on the board so not sure how the small ones will fare.  I did notice that the 4 big dice each for 2 players that came with the game was not enough per turn, I think 6 each of big dice would have been better.  


Its a party type game (20 minute filler) so playing with two players is really the weakest number IMO. Okay for practice. Rating is a 4 or 5 with 2 players, hopefully a 6 or a litte more with 3 or 4 players.

Takes all of 30 seconds to teach - and scratches the itch for a low-skill, low strategy, high-screwage kind of game. While it will never be the kind of game that has enough meat to sustain an entire evening's worth of gaming, it has exactly the type of flavour to kick off a game night and get everyone having fun and in the mood to play.

Great little dexterity game.  My 9-year-old son really likes this one -- he's a fan of dexterity games so I wasn't surprised.  I haven't played the full-size Tumblin' Dice, so can't compare them.  But this one works perfectly on our dining room table.

The regular TD is just too big to carry around, so I am hoping the Jr. version would be easier to take to game nights at other people's houses.  I might be getting rid of the larger version, just because I can't see needed it anymore.

Almost as good as the larger version, I use smaller dice to make it much more similar to the original version. You have a bunch of different colored dice? Play with a lot of people, it becomes quite chaotic and really fun.

Not quite as good as it's big brother, but still a great game. If you don't have the fat loot to spend on the big one, this is a fine substitute. I don't regret paying a ton less for this and spending the savings elsewhere.

Winners for $9.99.  I'm very stoked for this game... kim likes the flick style stuff.

First game she kicked my butt.  This was a lot of fun.  Hard even with such a short space to judge how much flick power you're going to need.
Second game a four way one... I actually did really well on this.  Dec 25, 2010

Fast dexterity game.

The box say 2 players, but with added dice, you can easily manage 4 on the board (even 6 if you get less dice per player).

The luck factor is balanced by the low playing time.

I meant to buy the regular Tumblin-Dice, however am pleased with the Jr version, which is merely for two people and not four.  It's a lot of fun like shuffleboard and makes a good party/bar type game.  It's tough controlling dice, though.

Excellent quick dexterity game.  Flick or roll (I prefer flicking) your dice into scoring positions.  I would love to find the original!

I'm also considering adding two more sets of coloured dice regardless to up the number of players!

While this is a true dexterity game, I do find this fun. It very easy to play while watching some football and drinking beer. While I rate this game low, I have a lot of plays. Fun when in the mood.

As dexterity games go, this is a nice one.  I'll likely never own it, but it's hard to walk past it and not play a couple games.  flicking the dice into the correct tiers is challenging as is finessing the dice past the x0 tier.
good stuff.

It's just like it's big brother, but so tiny and cute! Actually, it's not quite the same: only 2 sets of 4 dice (2-player support), only 2 4x areas instead of 3, and it doesn't seem as nicely made. Still fun, though, despite the fact that the standard d6 included with the game look ridiculously huge on this tiny little board. We'll probably buy replacement mini dice and use those instead.

RATING: 7
In a way, this reminds me of a classier "Sorry! Sliders".  "Tumblin-Dice Jr." definitely wins out in the components department with its lovely wooden bits vs. the cheap cardboard of "Sorry! Sliders", but it doesn't match up in terms of the fun and variety in game play that "Sorry! Sliders" provides with it's different score boards, 2-4 player capability, and lack of dependence on die rolls.  However, this game is still a very simple, fun, quick-playing dexterity experience that makes an ideal filler game.  And with a few tweaks, it can become even better.  For starters, the luck of the dice can be reduced by adding each die to its level number instead of multiplying the numbers.  And I'm working on a variant that gives each of the player's 4 dice a different scoring ability, which should make the game more interesting!  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

Great fun.  Nice game to break out when you want something quick and exciting.

I have not played Tumblin' Dice, but I have to say that the Jr. version handles 3 players very well.  I think 4 would be possible, but probably too much with standard dice.  However, I am going to find some smaller dice and I'll bet the game will work great for 4.

Yes, I am sure Tumblin Dice is better than Jr., but probably not a better value.  For my budget, the large version would probably not even be worth $80.

I am very happy with Jr.

Update:  Rating went down from 8.5 to 7.5.  Nothing wrong with tthe game, but it doesn't feel like an 8.5.  I almost left it at an 8 though.  Very good for what it does and I am almost always happy to play.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

RATING: 7
The game is a lot of fun, and pretty much hits the mark with the description on the front of the box: It mixes shuffleboard and dice!  It's a clever design, and it allows players to try different tactics.  Do they want to try several gentle flicks with a better chance of controlling which side will face up, or do they want to go for broke and try for hitting the "x4" level?  There's even a tactical advantage to blocking, which can be good if your opponent knocks you down to a lower level, or bad if he knocks you off the board.  Plus, it plays so quickly that the randomness of the dice aren't that big of a deal.  I only wonder if I will want to upgrade to the Sr. edition at some point in the future....

the first game rules tell you exactly where to put your peices and whos what race, bit odd comared to the normal way of setting up risk

RATING: 8.3
A bad ass RISK based on a bad ass game universe, the Starcraft version is colorful and the figures look great. Numerous variants in the box, including team play, and the achievement and faction cards elevate this beyond the mere dudes on a map feel of some earlier versions. Each faction has two different colored armies and a unique leader in case you're playing with larger numbers. Does lack aerial combat, so this is purely the ground war units from the PC game, but it doesn't feel like a loss when you're actually in play.

Played a 4 player "Command Room". Had 1 player who had never even played the original Risk before and she loved it (probably because she won). Our group ranged in ages from 12-60 and everyone had a good time. Really fun light party game.

I love both StarCraft and Risk, and this combines the two perfectly.  The new mechanic of using cards for the special ability noted, or saving them for reinforcements adds a great new level to the game.  I find myself using the abilities more often, but since there is no max hand size, dropping 7 down at once and getting an overwhelming rush or reinforcements can win the game.  
     Highly recommended to any others who enjoy both games.

Looks great! Better than the classic version of Risk but.. it's still Risk (too slow & repetitive). Get it ONLY if you love BOTH SC and Risk! Btw, a hero unit was chipped, and the game included the 'european' insert, in which all armies get 'squashed' together.

Love the theme, it actually does come through even if the gameplay is just simple risk. The cards really help add to the theme and the objectives keep the game short. Great game, especially for those that like war games and risk.

I like having missions to work towards opposed to global domination.  However, I am not a fan of the cards which provide drastic swings and greatly change the game (such as Zerg Tunneling Claws, Terran Cloak, etc.)

Finally got this to the table. It is literally the RISK map, just mirrored over and re themed. 

But I was in love with the box full of star craft minis, and if one really loved RISK it has numerous play modes in the box for a lot of replay-ability.

Played a two-person game. Favourite version of Risk so far. The crystals give structure to the board; the achievements give structure to play; and the faction cards give exciting theming to moves (eg the zerg burrowing under your defences to pop out the back). Sure, the combat is just Risk dice-rolling, but the game around it is actually really fun.

A really great variation of RISK, that features a really awesome looking map, buckets of minis and quite clear rules for the most part. And it features 4 different modes to play the game, and some with slight variations of their own.
If you like the StarCraft video game series, then you'll enjoy this boardgame most likely.

I'm such a HUGE Starcraft fan.  I had to buy it.  I hate to be a tool and insist on preserving it unopened in its shrink wrap, but so far that is what has happened.  I never bought something like a toy and kept it unopened in its box before.  shrug.  Is this even a good game?  I am too busy playing all my adored Euro games to play Risk and its variants.  I felt compelled to collect it because I am such a Starcraft fanboy of the highest order.

The game has brutal cards like "opponent discards 2 cards" which can be extremely game changing.  Great production with the board art and miniatures.   The game plays faster that most other Risk variants as well.

Played shortly after the LotR Risk. It's an improvement on the formula but not by much.
The added achievements and permanent rewards are sweet but the lack of a set timer is a step back. Sure, the achievemtns are also a timer of sorts but one that can still lead to overly long playtimes.

Best edition of a bad game. 

2p version is still utter tripe.

Makes risk infinitely more interesting just by putting in in the Starcraft setting, but also adds several meaningful gameplay options that actually gives more tactical options and removed a bit of luck

As a risk gamer since i am 12 and big starcraft fan, i like this of course very much. Not only causing by the theme, in my opinion it has the best risk rules i have seen until now. Collection trade points for reinforcements, open mission goals and the higher rated ares with crystals and the leader function is the perfect summary of risk variants in one game. It was worth every cent, not at last cause of the great miniatures.

Starcraft is basically Black Ops with are side board and faction cards. It is actually more fun than Black Ops because of the card. None of the cards are overpowering and add a few options to the game. The same was true of UASopoly's version of Halo Wars. (Halo Legendary is an excellent version of Risk.) The cards are not a big change but they 'compplete' the game.

Excellent : Starcraft and Risk uniting !!!  Miniatures are of the highest quality and details.

Cons  : why only one command center per army? Could have been better with the possibility to build more
Why only 2 units type per army? I would have personnaly prefer a 3rd one (flyers for example) , even if they had to sacrifice the heroes for the production costs. Cuz Starcraft is about strategy, not heroes.

Sadly also, I would have like them to make a Risk Warcraft or Risk Diablo. I hope it happens some day.

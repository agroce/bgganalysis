Pleasant game of moving, placement, and scoring.  It has some neat decisions, and lasts just long enough to watch your plans fall apart.  Looks neat too.  Not great, but decent.

Sometimes a 'roll-and-move' game can be interesting.  This happens to be one of those times.  The core game play centers around building up and scoring points for what you've built.  The trick is being in the right place to build something of note.  That's where the die comes in on this game.  But what makes it interesting is that all players are struggling to get into a good spot and subject to the die's whim and so each turn building is one that you hope to set up a future option.  And it turns out that advance planning is possible to a degree.  The game builds vertically and has a very visual element to it.  If 3D geometry / visualization is a problem, you might find the game more taxing, but its quite approachable to players of different skills and ages.  This is actually a good game to lure non-gamers/traditional gamers into modern designs.  Overall, the game will run a tad long for experienced Euro-gamers and thus doesn't fall into the filler range.  However, it will feel quite satisfying to newer gamers and as such it makes a nice gateway game or perhaps an opener for a game session.

The game itself is original and very beautiful worked out. But it seems that the player who took the best start can runaway. Because he has the best levels, he gets points of other players who build on his platforms, so he has a lot of points to pay with for movement.

Played it some more now and Casa Grande is a decent game. Raised my score to 8 and the game deserves it.

 Now for a game I would be happy to never play again. I had very high hopes for this game, because the components look nice, and I always like the idea of building a game space vertically instead of the typical 2-dimensional game. But the board is so cramped and small that every single time you play you have the potential of completely destroying your opponents' plans. I don't mind games that make you adjust your plans and think on the fly, but the way this one works it frequently occurs that someone can place a platform that completely blocks off your pieces and flushes all the progress you made down the toilet. Frankly it feels like forward planning is pointless, and you just have to throw some pieces down and hope that on your turn you can place one more that will let you build a platform. As a result of this constant frustration, analysis-paralysis goes through the roof. Even players who normally play at top speed can be slowed to a crawl trying to examine the whole game space and see if they can do anything worthwhile. My final complaint will be the components. In a game with stacking of blocks you'd think the one thing they'd get right is making building blocks that stack well. Instead they include these pieces that kind of lock together, but you have to aim them just right, and when pushing them together you risk toppling all the other buildings around. I'm afraid my wife might have enjoyed this game somewhat, so I might have to play again, but this is one I'd love to just trade away and never see again.

A very good building game. The ability to use that point track to advance your die roll negates luck factor. NOT a game for Michael J. Fox (just a joke, people!) or people with fat elephant fingers...

There’s nothing special or innovative about Casa Grande, yet it manages at keeping players entertained with even some thrills: it’s so intuitive that its rules can be explained in a couple of minutes and then it’s immediately clear how it works. Its only downside is it lasts a bit too much, which means that toward the end it gets boring and repetitive. [i](January 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - No way it deserves a 7: probably even a 6 is still too high a rating but until I’ll play it again I’ll stick to the latter. Rating lowered during my Fall 2015 rating revise.

You're building up and out in this game, using Tetris-like platforms to take it to the next level and score even more points.  But you also have to balance the bonus track - where spending points lets you build exactly where you want, but if you earn enough points you get an immediate cashout for a nice amount.

This game has real problems, though.  First - long-term planning is very difficult, because one player can undo several turns of investment you made.  Secondly - that bonus track payout is often far more profitable than the building itself.  Third - the pieces don't fit together well, so the whole arrangement gets very perilous.  Lastly, the time listed is wildly inaccurate.  45 minutes for 4 players?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

There was a lot of promise here, but it fell flat with me and I have no desire to try it again.

RATING: 3
So this game gives you multiple ways to get screwed: random luck of the die, someone else taking a spot you wanted, someone else covering the pieces you spent tempos placing, losing all your bonus points by hitting the top when someone gives you some, not getting bonus points when you need them.  I could go on, but I already spent more time on this turd than it deserves.

Casa Grande is a good 3D building game. Not in the dexterity area, but in building up areas of control in 3D space. You place column supports in a grid according to where your marker lands after a die roll (the roll can be amended by using previously gained points), and you then try and build different shaped flat landings at various levels using your column supports. You score points related to the size of the landing you place multiplied by the level you are building on. It makes for a game which evolves slowly and beautifully into a wonderful 3D structure and is unlike any other game. The opportunities to screw your opponent is also rife and brings a real competitive dimension to the play.

It's an easy gateway game, great for playing with kids or people that don't want to remember a lot of rules. Gameplay is light, with a few decisions to counter the luck of the die.

Replayability is not so good tough, specially when you are used to more complicated games.

RATING: 8
Casa Grande was quite the pleasant surprise.  This is a solid game with lots of interesting choices and options.  There is a noticeable tenseness that develops in the placement of building blocks, as players try to properly place their blocks in order to construct platforms before their opponents can interfere with those plans.  I enjoy the mental challenge of discerning potential building locations and cleverly placing blocks to construct platforms, especially at elevated heights.  There is an angst-inducing trade-off in placing blocks on opponents’ platforms (which rewards them with bonus points) in order to potentially construct higher levels.  All of this is present in a game that is fairly easy to learn and play.

Solid games that are equally appealing to dedicated gamers, spouses and children are not all that common.  I am happy to say that Casa Grande is one of those games.  What a pleasant surprise indeed!

speelplein Bartje Beveren 22/12/14. Elk om beurt dobbelt en verzet zijn pionnetje in de vakjes rondom de vierkante bouwzone. In de rij of kolom waar je pionnetje terecht komt, mag je een plastic blokje (ca 2x2 cm) bouwen. Als je kunt, mag je er ook kartonnen plaatjes op leggen (het minimum aantal ondersteuningen in jouw kleur en hun positie staat aangeduid met een vierkantje op de plaatjes). De grootte van de kartonnetjes bepaalt hoeveel puntengeld je krijgt. Als je op de hoeken belandt, mag je drie stappen hoger op het spaarspoor; als je daar 9 bereikt, krijg je 9 puntengeld. Je mag gespaarde stappen ook inleveren in ruil voor extra zetten met je pionnetje. Als je bouwt op kartonnetjes van anderen, krijgen die een spaarstap bij. Spel valt best mee; er ontstaat een leuk kluwen van gebouwde blokjes en plaatjes.

Nothing new or groundbreaking, but still a decent game with plenty of interaction and blocking moves. 

Runs a bit long, so next time I'll play with fewer blocks (rulebook suggests fewer blocks as a shorter variant, so I assume some of the playtesters at Ravensburger agree with me on the game being too long).

It is BEST played with four players!   The game is fairly basic when starting out early.  Creating some footprint on the ground floor platforms when building.  The game starts to really be interesting in the middle of the game, as people start positioning themselves for long-term scores.  The final third of the game is where players are really competing (using pillars) to attempt to achieve one or more of those super high-level builds that generate large scores!  This is an elegant and pretty game with some nuances.  There is flexibility on using your bonus track to manage one's dice luck (or lack thereof).  A really tricky game and very eye-pleasing to watch as the game builds out and up.

Ravensburger seems to come up with solid one hour games that I enjoy every Essen.  They usually are nothing spectacular, but are just fun.  This one fits the bill.  Players basically build up to gain more points and there is room for some aggressive play - playing nice in this game is generally a recipe for disaster.  While this is a "roll and move" game, there is another mechanism added on that allows you to continue further than the die roll assuming you have bonus points left.  Where you end your movement is the column/row you must build a foundation.

A relatively simple game where you try to build blocks and platforms.  The game seemed to go on a bit too long for what it was.  The denominations of currency were a very odd choice.  

We had some minor confusion on allowing building below existing levels.

Also the blocks don't fit into each other as easily as we would have liked.  Often they snapped in place off center and this caused a lot of chaos on the board as our large hands tried to unplug and reassemble.

Quite a typical building block game, with the usual Ravensburger color scheme. Uses cheap paper money for VPs instead of cardboard chits.

By forgetting the most important rule of not building identical tiles on top of each other, you'll screw up the experience entirely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I think older children might get some mileage from Casa Grande, but experienced gamers will probably find it very repetitive.

Players get points for placing cardboard floor sections into an evolving "building", adding one support piece at a time. Dice determine which area is available for building each turn, although players have a lot of latitude to alter the dice result and there are many spaces available in each. The problem is, the strategy is pretty obvious: build the biggest pieces on the top floors, for maximum points. It is possible to block other players, but doing so uses your only placement for the round. Every game feels the same.

The components are OK, but the towers and tiles are fiddly to work with. Rules are clear.

This is a fast abstract type euro-game that has some really good decisions but does not seem to promote AP so there isn't a lot of down time.  Each turn there is an ebb and flow of offense and defense but there always seems to be options even when cutoff.  

Just a fun fast abstract that has enough depth to enjoy over and over.  Plus, it looks really great at the end when everyone can see the crazy structure(s) that have been erected.

RATING: 7
Fun game with some interesting decisions despite the underlying roll-and-move mechanism. The ability to use the bonus points to modify your rolls helps decrease the feeling of luck/randomness you'd expect in a roll-and-move; of course, you are still rolling a die!

Not good enough to buy, necessarily, but I'd certainly be willing to play it from time to time.

--- Summary ---
Every player has a bunch of plastic supports, and the same combination of cardboard flats in different shapes. Their player marker starts on a different corner of the grid-like board. Another marker starts on the 5 space of the bonus track, which has 9 spaces in all.

On your turn, roll the d6 and move your pawn (everyone's starts on a different corner of the board) clockwise. May spend bonus pts to move further. If you end up on a corner space, move up 3 spaces on the bonus track. If not, you must place one support in the row or column where your marker ended up. If you place the piece on top of another players flat (may not place directly atop their support), they earn bonus pt = height of the level; move marker up on track. Any time a bonus marker reaches the 9+ position, take $9 and reset marker to 0 on the bonus track. Then, may place one of your shaped cardboard flats, if your support pieces are in the appropriate positions shown on the flat; earn money = size of flat x height of flat.

The game ends when someone plays their last support piece; most money wins!

A game of trying to get into position to place high-scoring high platforms before anyone else can get there first, with a little bit of frustration around the placement restrictions. 

There's a game, but there's a lot of randomness to try and manage (with winning margins very close to the bonus points from not using up bonus to adjust dice rolls) for a game that's so critically about timing. I'm passing my copy on.

Casa Grande is a long line of games coming out from Ravensburger. While not all Ravensburger games are hits, they have had a decent amount of success in the family line of games which includes Indigo, Scotland Yard, Pyramid...etc. I particularly find myself enamored by their spatial games such as Casa Grande. This game supposedly has shades of Pueblo where players construct tetris-like tiles in ever-increasing heights. The higher the level of construction, the more money one gets. Ultimately, the player with the most money wins the game. A separate bonus track on the side allows players to either collect additional money or move pawns to specific locations for construction of blocks. 

Overall a simple game with simple rules, but players who enjoy 3D type block construction games will enjoy this puzzle.

Better than Pueblo, but that's not saying much.  Maybe just not a fan of these types of games.  This would be good for families.  Not much here for serious gamers.

The description as is posted above and on bgg, explains very good how the game works. This is a simple family game. Nothing wrong with it, but also not one, I would recommend to somebody to run to the store and get it. On the other hand, if somebody would ask me to join him in this game, I wouldn’t say no.

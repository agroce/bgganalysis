I was really, really, really looking forward to playing this game at BGG.Con 2014 after missing it the previous year. On the final day of the Con my buddy and I finally sat down to demo it and... it kind of fell flat for us. :(  I knew everything about the game going in, but was still surprised at how random it was. I spent the entire time floating around the map doing, well, nothing really, since I could never find the Ovoid. And then the game ended. 

I'll try it again sometime, but I'm not really anxious to slap down any money for it just yet, if ever.

RATING: 7.3
Demoed at Gateway 2013.  Space-based deduction game combined with certain combat and movement card effects.  Fairly significant downtime as each player typically has to organize a large hand of cards each turn.  Other players actions sometime reveal information, however, so engagement remains decent.  Variable player powers appear well-balanced.  All-or-nothing end-game maintains tension well. Contains elements reminiscent of Merchant of Venus (point-to-point movement), Race for the Galaxy (combat and card effects), and Infiltration (hidden information and locks needing keys), along with some fresh ideas.  At its core, however, it's just deduction so some of the more complex interworkings can fall away rapidly if information is inadvertently leaked.  Seems to have high replay value, as its a game played against other people much more so than against the game.

RATING: 6.75
A unique experience combining deduction and inference with some light combat and creativity, Chaosmos is definitely a one-of-a-kind of experience. It is light and prone to bouts of predictability, but usually provides a fun play.

RATING: 8
5 plays:

One of the greatest theme-forward games I've ever played!

Like a simple RPG that incorporates sci-fi fun, battle, bluffing, misdirection, adventure, and survival pressure.

Incredibly well designed and well built.  Character pieces are individually designed and sculpted; there are bits of story text all over the place, totally thousands of words. Instructions are well done. Just a phenomenal product.

Accessible to young and inexperienced players, but with some strategic depth for more experienced players. 

Has the drawback that each player would do better if they kept lengthy records of what everyone has done, because it would help keep track of which cards are where... so players need to agree to keep the game light and flowing.

The level of complexity is just perfect to bring the scenario to life, without feeling onerously complex. It's like Dominion in its level of complexity, and in how well the cards communicate their roles so you don't have to memorize anything. Some advanced gamers would definitely feel that the core game mechanics are a bit too haphazard and nonlinear; it can feel a bit like Calvinball at times. But I love this balance; no player is more than a few smart or lucky moves from winning, and yet smart strategy and misdirection still matter immensely.

Highly recommend reading William Sleator's "Interstellar Pig" alongside this game; it was the very specific inspiration, and it adds hugely to enjoying the game.

RATING: 6
Unique game.  It's like hide-and-seek, but in space and with aliens.  The ending is always intense and fun, but I've found picking it back up after not having played for a while is a bit of a challenge.  Would recommend 3-4 players.

Good Theme and some nice mechanics ideas. 
Having said that... 
I Thought it was too much random, luck dependant and everything hangs on last round dice roll. Also, the last player has a huge advantage just by being the last player. And there is NOTHING anyone can do about it...

This is an experience designed to be the opposite of cynicism and alienation. It is an optimistic vision of a dark and mysterious universe. It's a game about chaos and confusion that resolves itself with revelation. In that regard it reminds us that order naturally forms from the seeds of chaos. Also there is a pink bunny in the game called the Smuggler Bunny.

A most unique treasure-hunting title indeed. Love the concept of laying traps for opponents (something I do wish there were a few more of included - so much potential with this aspect), but the game is a fantastic seek-and-deny bluffing experience, with decent combat and plenty of player race skills to promote variety. So many of the cards are useful in a specific situation, always constrained by handsize, makes for some wonderful tactical decisions. Pricey, for what the game is, but worth it.

RATING: 6
There are no Victory Points here, only the stark black-and-white of "when the game ends, do you have the MacGuffin?" This can feel harsh - plans which [i]might[/i] have worked only matter if they did, and sometimes that's due to dice rather than merit - but is also somewhat... refreshing? And the knowledge-economy-game concept is neat; I'm not sure it's the sort of game I'm usually interested in playing, though.

I can easily see how the information-tracking/deduction, deceit, and mind-games could layer interestingly deeply with an experienced table.

(You will want to keep far more cards than you can, and will have to make choices about what to leave behind. The only saving grace is that this is true for everyone.)

Really neat bluffing game with special powers on a sci fi theme. Good components. The biggest thing is that it only goes up to 4 and it appears to have okay replayability only that you see all the cards in one go and there are only a few things you can do to bluff. Needs an expansion to be great.

Very interesting game. I played a four version game with one of the designers and he was very nice helping me figure out how to play.  I had trouble understanding how all the elements worked together through my first play, but I'm thinking that if I were to play it all again, the theme and ideas in the game would come to the fore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Based on one play this is an enjoyable interesting game of bluff, combat and cunning plans. A game that will only improve with a group of players that get to know all the cards and options.

The one fly in the ointment is possibly the turn-order - it is fixed from the start and on the last turn going first is a major downside and going last a major advantage. A variant is needed to allow the players some means of manipulating or offsetting this. An 8 rating with this fixed.

Good game of deception - think the Oddball multiplayer variant from Halo. Find the Ovoid and keep it for as long as possible. Some of the aliens have far more useful abilities than others which may leave some players feeling underpowered. Luckily the game setup includes a drafting session where all players are presented with two choices of alien and must pick one.

We played with the Dark Ovoid variant which includes two ovoids and a randomly-selected "cipher" card that tells players which ovoid is real. When the game is over, only the real ovoid wins the game. This was great, but I started with the cipher card in my home planet and my opponent was the psychic alien, which led him to discovering the real ovoid on turn one.

When a player picks up the ovoid, it becomes a chase to hunt them down and gang up on them. A player with powerful attack cards in their hand can defend nearly indefinitely against the other players - particularly in the late game when many of the powerful, one-use weapon cards are in the discard pile. This can leave unlucky, underpowered players feeling useless and turns can drag on and on as players constantly roll for damage, hoping both that they roll the highest possible roll and that their opponent rolls the lowest possible roll (The chance of this happening is about 2%).

This wouldn't be such a problem if the powerful advanced weaponry cards (Which add +2 attack/defense) were one-use. Instead, they are permanent cards that can be used again and again. I didn't have a chance to see all of the cards in the game, but it felt like there weren't enough cards to combat a weapon-heavy player in a three-player game. But only further games will tell.

Nem egy komolyanvehető darab. Poénos cuccok, poénos mechanikák, fajok. Érzésre nagyon hasonlít a cosmic encounterre, de sokkal jobban összerakott darab. Egyetlen egy dolgot nem szabad: komolyan venni.

RATING: 10
Simple rules that allow for 'deep' mindgames and even without adding any of the extra rules and elements (which are quite a few) this game has amazing replay value as you inevitably develop more elaborate strategies. My favourite game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Free game structure and natural progression from early to end game is interesting as players hunt for the Ovoid and then pretend to not know where it is.

It seems multiple plays are really needed to grasp to flow of play in this one. There is the sense that my group plays too defensively and that combat should abound from early-game in order to drag information out of players--even at the cost of some of one's own secrecy.

Kickstarted January 2014 (Master of the New Universe tier with the extra alien and cards for 5th player). Received May 2015. Sold June 2015. Won another copy in the July 2017 G4GG, which I then traded for [thing=43111][/thing].

A wonderful realization of the creepy game in William Sleator's young adult sci-fi Interstellar Pig.

Space exploration, social deduction and bluffing with innovative mechanics, in about 90 minutes. Which is, as far as I know, a unique combination.

Fun, and arguably gets better with repeat plays. It's all about controlling the all-or-nothing end game, and the obvious strategies don't necessarily work - although there seem to be some combos that would be hard to beat. I can see it being frustrating if you have no clue where the Ovoid is for most of the game.

After a few plays I feel like the end game is where most of the tension and interest resides - it's a bit of a shame that it takes three quarters of the game to get there. (Not that the first three quarters of the game is bad, but I guess I prefer a more even experience.) Which means the "short game" is far preferable.

Played 3 games so far and everybody loves it! It is a very simple game that is very fun with just the base rules. The rules are very short, easily organized, and easy to touch. The learning curve is easy and the aim of the game is simple. FIND THE OVOID! but SHHHhhh!!! ... don't tell anyway, or its all out war for the ovoid! No player elimination. Impossible for there to be a run away winner. Ever game was always close!

loved it! recommend for all! combat and hand management really fun!

RATING: 10
Fantastic game. It took us a few minutes to get everything unpacked and sorted. It was scary to see the long complex-looking rulebook, but it was actually quite simple to understand. We first did the "first game" rules to get a handle on gameplay, and then did a standard 3 player game. The game was intense (for us laid-back players) and kept us in anticipation of what would happen next. I look forward to playing all of the characters to see which I like best and then moving on to the game's many variants. Easily one of the best and most versatile games I own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like some people probably have said - feels like a combination of Cosmic Encounter and Clue.

I was impressed with my 1st session. The rules all made sense. Every time I asked about something, the answer was very clear and easily found. I know that doesn't sound like much, but I have found some kickstarter games to show up with lots of rules questions and feel like they weren't playtested very well, so it was a relief to find that this game felt very well playtested.

I wasn't sure the mechanics were going to be for me, but it turns out I had a very enjoyable first game and look forward to playing it again.

It did seem like the first player to lose a battle got picked on a lot for a couple of reasons:
1. If two people were fighting, there was a good chance it was because one of them had scryed the other and so one of those 2 people was going to have the Ovoid.
2. The person that lost a battle - you get to see what cards he played in the fight and then you know that the winner probably stole his best combat card, so you have a good chance of beating him too. 
3. The more people beat that character and steal his cards, the easier he is to beat - kind of like the skinny kid on the playground that everyone takes his lunch money - the only question is, who can get to him first.

This was just an initial impression and I'll update this once I get some more plays in.

Over-all, it was tricky and sneaky and that is the kind of game I like. I think everyone at the table enjoyed the experience.

RATING: 6
I initially rated this a 7, but by the end of 2015 it's fallen in favor... I like the game, but it seems that most of the people I've taught it to do not, and have little interest in playing it again. 

Unfortunately this means that after owning the game for about 7 months, I have yet to get beyond the intro and basic setups for the game. I haven't gotten to try the majority of the aliens or the optional and advanced rules that look really interesting.

It might rank higher again some day...

Well, it's well named.  It's kind of a memory/guessing game with the location of the Ovoid, but there's also a lot of chaos and figuring out how to fight the right person at the right time.

Chaosmos deserves praise for being innovative in its design and mechanics.  Trying to find the Ovoid is a lot of fun, but once someone has it, the fun factor decreases.  Good game, but not great.  Artwork is terrible.

RATING: 9
WOW! What a surprising game that met my expectations and then some. Chaosmos is an intergalactic game of cat and mouse. The object is to acquire the Ovoid (a powerful MacGuffin) and hold onto it until the end of the game. Along the way, you can hide the Ovoid on a planet, gain valuable weapons and use other trick cards to ruin your opponent's plans. The combat element is simple but effective. With lots of built-in gameplay variants and different ways to spice up the game, Chaosmos is a certifiable keeper in my collection! You'll never play the same game twice.

Chasmos is definitely an innovative, unique concept. The "envelope" system is ingenious and lends itself to layers of strategies, deceptions, and bluffs. It has a lot to offer and I really enjoyed playing it, but it's not the style of game I'd want to play multiple times.

When the game clock runs out, whoever has the Ovoid wins.  Fly around from planet to planet, collecting weapons and utilities and attacking each other.  Gotta applaud the designers for a fresh new mechanic, I don't think I own any other game quite like it.

RATING: 6
I have only played this game 2-player and rated it as such. I expect it to be more fun with 2 or 4 and so am waiting for that opportunity before playing again. I expect my rating to go up at that player count, but can only guess.

At 2 players it is a fun game of hide and seek, but without another player to help pin someone down occasionally, it can get tiresome. Based on the abilities and equipment cards, eventually one player can end up with little to fear about the other.

It does get tense toward the end when time is running out and you need to pick up the Ovoid.

Awesome board/card game with an interesting space theme and several unique mechanics. You are searching the galaxy for the Ovoid(a card). Players want to have the Ovoid in hand before gametime runs out. Each planet you visit has a corresponding envelope containing cards that aid in finding the Ovoid, weapons to steal cards from other players, or even bend time. You get that M:tG mind game feel without having to learn a ton of cards. Can't wait to get a copy!

Hide and Seek IN SPACE! It's fun, hide the orb, keep the orb, do what you can once the timer runs out and then be the savior of the universe. Or don't. Just kill the universe. It's really fun. Each alien has a skill they can use and it's interesting to see how people use their weapons to hide/move the orb.

01-07-2015 - Demoed last year at BGG.  I was SO EXCITED to try this one.  My buddy and I got in a quick demo with a booth guy and... well, we just weren't really enamored.  We wanted to try again sometime, but aren't chomping at the bit and certainly didn't feel like spending the money on it after the one play.  We'll see though.  I think we wrapped our head more or less successfully around the game and how it operated, it just wasn't doing it for us so much.

Each planet has its own envelope of cards. When you arrive on a planet, you decide which cards you want to take and which to leave behind. Knowledge is the most powerful resource in the game, and being able to predict the cards your opponents possess at any given time is a powerful advantage as you build up a handful of weapons, tactical gear, vaults and traps, as well as cards that counter your opponents' cards. The best players will keep their hand fluid, constantly changing tactics while they search from world to world for the Ovoid or find a safe place to stash it.

What makes this shine is that it isn't just a fighting game it's about getting one specific card in-hand at game end, hiding it and bluffing about its location long enough to manage to get it back. great components as well, and  with turn wheel and extra modules.

AWESOME GAME!!! Our gaming group has had a blast with it.  Lots of bluffing, fighting, strategizing on when to make your move to grab the Ovoid at the last second for the dub!  Great production quality, they really did out do themselves!

Charmingly weird both regarding the game itself and its psychedelic space opera setting, Chaosmos manages to wring a good deal of game out of what is basically a Grail hunt. No victory points, no area majorities, no further repercussions from battles – if you’re holding the McGuffin card at the end of the game, you win and everybody else loses.

To get there requires some bluffing, adroit timing and a bit of set collection when putting together a nice combat hand to thwart the attempts of other players to steal the win from you once its location is clear. It all hangs together pretty well for a rather eclictic mixture of mechanisms, and judging from the two games we played, the cards that are the heart of the game were balanced quite carefully. Unless this is a wrong impression, further plays are very likely to increase the rating for this one, since replayability does not seem to be a problem.

One caveat is that this is not the science fiction epic you might expect from the hefty box (and the correspondingly hefty price point), but a rather unique and quick mixture of treasure hunting, tactical combat and hand management.

Learned of this game through a gaming group in it's development stages and have since gotten to know the designers.  

Since the beginning I thought the concept and gameplay of this game was extremely interesting.   The mechanics are truly unique (something quite hard to find) and very entertaining.  To me, it hit all the right buttons of a big strategy game, plus I get the satisfactions of great player interaction while literally laughing out loud at the twists and turns. 

After getting the final production copy of the game (as far as kickstarter games go, they really delivered), I was thoroughly impressed.  The components are AWESOME, you just have to see it, the miniatures are so well done, the art is beautiful, and I mean come on... Chaos Clock :P

Oh and replay value, I've played at least a dozen times already and among all the games we own, we go back to this again and again.

A space Ameritrash. Gameplay kind of splits into two phases: a space exploration phase during which everyone is searching for the Ovoid, and then once all the planets have been touched, it's a bit of hide-and-go-seek around the galaxy to figure out who has it/where it's stashed. The game idea is more fun than the gameplay itself, since in gameplay a lot of time is spent optimizing the allocation of cards. For me, it's a lot of rigamarole around the joy of bluffing, an itch that Stratego scratches more pointedly. The cards themselves can alter the fabric of the game (an Ameritrash quirk that I'm not fond of), but since many of these are one-time use, there's more of a level playing field once they're exhausted. Lots of attack/counter-attack type mechanics in the cards, too (not a plus for me). One neat feature is that each planet's windfalls are stored in a planetary envelope, which may be exchanged with players' hands; the windfalls then convey to whoever reaches that planet next (with certain provisos)

Chaosmos is a combination of a shell game with multiplayer combat.  Players begin with a bunch of cards in their hand, and knowledge of what's on their home planet.  One of these cards is the "Ovoid"--whoever has this at the end of the game is the winner.  Players move their ships around the board, landing on planets to look for the Ovoid, or fighting other players to steal a card from their hand (possibly the Ovoid).  So if you have the Ovoid, you can try stashing it somewhere you think others won't look, or you can hold onto it if you think you can fight off the attacks of others.  I'm not a huge fan of either shell games or multiplayer combat, and it seems like the way this game will go most of the time is that you spend the first part of the game trying to be as obfuscating as possible, and the second part trying to beat down on the leader.  I've only played the "short" game, which seemed like an appropriate length.

So far, this game has not convinced me.

To win, you have to have The Ovoid card in your hand when the timer reaches zero.

Going through the entire game searching every planet and combating opponents to search their hands and STILL not finding traces of The Ovoid is just not fun. I'm sure it's more entertaining for the couple of people who knows where it is and is fighting over it in secret, but for the rest it's just boring.

I typically do not enjoy games that are chaotic, and this one has so much chaos it's in the title.  However, I did enjoy playing it.  The ability to have a meaningful general strategy based upon the special powers of your race, and seeing that strategy play out and countered by the other players, seems to make the chaos of the game play more acceptable.  Kingmaking and teaming up on others are problematic issues.  However, overall, an enjoyable time while playing.

It's the end of the universe, and whoever holds the ovoid of the next universe at the game's end controls the new world. When you're at a world you're free to swap the cards from its folder into your hand, and can dump vault doors or traps to sabotage people who visit later. You can attack people to access their hand and take a card from it (such as the ovoid), and dealing with different weapons and counterweapons and making sure you have the ovoid at the end, with the ten different races all having unique abilities. So you're fighting to control planets and look through their cards, or fighting players to find the ovoid, or hiding the ovoid away safely at your homeplanet as the time clicks down.

What I really like is that while on the modular board there are some really basic mechanics, spending action points, combat, controlling planets, the real game lies in your hand, as you try and carry weapons to win fights (which are stacked on top of your rolls in combat, producing between 4 and infinite combat power), find the ovoid, and keep it safe before the end game. There are bases to bolster defenses, traps to teleport players back to their home-worlds, and vaults to lock things away from people's hands.

The player races all have their own rich backstories and flavor-texts, as well as distinct feels, which is really nice. One race has an alternate win condition requiring that no one wins (namely, that no one has the ovoid at the end of the game), while others have combat, movement, hand limit, or other types of neat boosts, allowing for some cool complex play.

An expansion is apparently in the works that really mixes up how the game works, and ups the player count to 6, so I'm pretty excited about this as well.

Last Origins I discovered DoW, and this Origins I discovered Chaosmos.

This is like a more discrete and coherent version of Cosmic Encounter with touches of 4x and other types of games, and is fairly short and sweet, which is quite nice as well.

I like to pronounce the game as if it was German, namely "Cow-ess-mose", since Chaosmos sounds really dumb.

Amazing concept that actually works, while creating great tension and memorable table stories. The card/alien artwork is a bit turpistic and uneven (think Cosmic Encounter), and if anything, I would upgrade them. The card design / iconography also feels a little bit "on budget". But it matters not - there's a great great game in here.

Chaosmos isn't very deep, and it is frustrating that the game is too short to develop long term strategies or diplomatic relationships with other players. 
However it's clear that Chaosmos isn't trying to be that kind of game.  
It wants to be a chaotic struggle where all players are making a mad scramble to the very end, strategy be damned...  And it's fun for it.

RATING: 6
Well, the name fits. Plenty of Chaos for the first 3/4 of the game, mostly spending that time learning how to counter your opponents hand of cards and hoping they don't throw you a last minute curve ball. Once the space egg is discovered it's just a crazy game of hot potato until time runs out. Be careful about wasting your strong attack cards in the early game. If you don't have a sure-fire way to win a combat you've already lost the game. I wish there were a few more escape options.

I backed this game on Kickstarter, back in January 2014, and was very excited by the idea of it - it seemed a very fresh and innovative design, with lots of player interaction (most of it not of the "take that" kind, although there is plenty of combat, especially towards the end of the game, involving dice but without them usually being the determining factor). I also liked that it seemed to be a game that caused a lot of after-game conversation about what went on (since no player can really know what other players are doing during the game itself), and potentially each game could be its own exciting "story".

After numerous delays, I finally got the game in early May 2015, and managed to play it twice within the next few days, once as a 2p game and once with 3. (Both used the "first game" setup with some cards and planets removed and a restricted set of aliens to play.) I did not expect the game to be that good with 2, but the game went well, with my wife declaring a willingness to play again, although not seeming too excited with it. The reaction to the 3p game seemed similar. (I won, despite not having even seen the Ovoid once until I won it in combat with my last action and then played the Temporal Displacer - the player who had had it at the start said that the game wasn't so interesting for him, which I think is fair comment for a new player, you can't explore to try to find the Ovoid if you already have it, and a new player won't yet know which other cards are out there and might be important.)

Personally, I am just as excited by this game now, having played it, as I was when I first backed it - but, while I do not expect it to languish unplayed in my collection for ages (like many other games I really like), I do not think the others in my group will want to play it every week or two, as I do (at least at the moment). I do think that, with the right game group, this could be one of the very best and most fun games I have. (And I can't wait to try out all the different aliens, and games with all the cards.) Unfortunately, since those first two game it has indeed remained unplayed, I've suggested it a few times but there hasn't been any enthusiasm among the others to play it. So it seems certain that I won't be playing this anywhere near as often as I would like.

I should mention that the alien miniatures are really good as well :)

Love the concept.  Played a demo game at GenCon 2014 and after only one turn I knew I had to preorder.  The version I played was not the final art, but the game mechanics had me hooked: investigation, bluffing, low randomness after the initial card shuffling, modular board, good few or many players.

This one doesn't see enough play, mainly because most of my usual gaming friends don't have the same fondness for Interstellar Pig that I do.

Really fun and deep game. Great for many players with the time to play it through.

If you like Cosmic Encounter, then this is a game for you! Unlike that game, instead of wagering ships to determine if you will win battles or get cards, Chaosmos uses an envelope mechanic, hiding a special card (the Ovoid) and hoping you will have it in your hand by the end of the game. The artifact and battle cards have more variety than Cosmic Encounter, although there are fewer races so far. However, the ability to bluff makes it a completely different experience. Think of it kind of like Cosmic Encounter meets Coup.

A really fun game and - bonus - it has incredible minis!

This is a unique and strange game.  It's essentially a game of keep away/hide-and-seek.  In this game each player plays an alien race attempting to find an artifact called the Ovoid.  The map in this game is made up of planets and each planet has a cache of cards on it, each player also has a hand of cards.  One of these is the Ovoid and the object is to have it in your hand at game end.  You can carry the Ovoid with you or hide it on different planets.  But players can attack each other and look through their hands or take control of planets and look through their cache of items.  But then still you can set traps on planets that go off when another player takes control of it.

These are all really neat ideas but unfortunately games tend to turn out less clever than they could/should.  Almost any time a player finds the Ovoid they just keep it in their hand and attempt to bolster their hand of attack cards to avoid losing it in battle.  Also, a standard game takes 36 turns.  In theory this can go by pretty quickly, each player gets 3 actions on their turn and these can be as simple as moving 3 spaces.  But if everyone is not willing to go quickly this can drag, but it really should be played as a fast-paced game.

Despite those two gripes I still kinda like the game.  It is unique and there are a lot of additional rules and variants to play with to expand the possibilities in the game.  I recommend playing with some of these from the start.  The basic/teaching game is kind of dull and the game really opens up once you expand it a bit.

It also looks fantastic with great artwork, sturdy map tiles, and alien miniatures for each race.

I liked the idea of this game more than the game. Execution was great. The planet envelopes were a fun twist. The plastic figures were nice, map was good, count-down clock was great, etc. 

The hide-and-seek bluffing aspect is what really drives the game, though and that's not a mechanic that tends to work all that well in my groups. Still it was a unique experience unlike any of our other games. I'd be happy to play it again, but probably wouldn't want it to become a regular event.

Saw this at BGG Con and was immediately intrigued.  Instead of waiting around for a demo I just went ahead and tried it with some friends.  After working through the rule book we played it and had a blast!

Playing secret hot potato the first game was fun but you could generally quickly figure out who has the ovoid.  At that point, I just let someone else have it, followed them around, and built up an unbeatable hand.  At the last moment, I grabbed the ovoid and won.

The second game we figured out how to better use the counter weapons and had some more interesting race options.  The one guy we knew was going to win suddenly lost the ovoid to me because I had been paying attention to the weapons he was using and was able to beat him.  

The game has a large amount of different races with wildly different powers.  Some feel a little underwhelming, some feel like they're hard to play, and some feel really overpowered, but there's a lot of variety to keep things interesting. They even have an option with a second decoy ovoid that sounds really interesting that I can't wait to play.

My only real criticism of the game is that it feels like it could have more than four players with the large number of races that come with the game.

Provisional rating, one short play (24 ticks?) at Spiel.

The usual mix of getting resources and turning them into something else. The ‘deck building’ nature of the cards does promote a bit of strategy over tactics and the game plays very smoothly and is full of quite a few difficult decisions but I don't think the game overall stands out above most other sych games in my collection.

RATING: 7.5
A non-rondel game from the rondel master. This time he cleverly and seamlessly slipped the rondel feel into a hand of action cards with Ancient Rome exploration and building as the backdrop. 

Gameplay involves selecting an action card and executing it each turn, with one if the actions being to get your hand of cards back again. Everyone starts with the same hand but during the course of the game your deck will grow and change. The rules and gameplay are relatively simple but the strategy and decisions are not. The goal is to get the most points and these are obtained through multipliers on the cards and payout similar to Navegador. 

The actions are as follows: 1) move (optional) and build in a city/region (this is a coveted action as presence in regions/built cities key off of many of the point multipliers), 2) purchase new cards (the more cards the more options and the more points), 3) generate resources from a region or take money, 4) copy an action played by another player, 5) buy and/or sell resources which is very important for cash generation and resource flexibility, and 6) retrieve your cards, while generating a small amount of cash and having an opportunity for generating more colonists. There are more of the same, different, and similar cards that you can acquire through option 2.

The game goes into end phase when either the last card has been purchased or when a player has built his last house (these are built in cities). Points are scored at the end, are scored for several different categories, and can be huge IF you focus on meshing your card collection with your actions taken (example creating a lot if new colonists and purchasing cards with colonist cards- the temptation is simply to card grab).

The game board is double-sided for different number of players and the game seems to scale well for 3-5 players (I have not tried 2er yet). The components are excellent as always for a Gerdts game. This is a very solid, professional design.

I finally bought this Concordia, and it's convinced me that it's something special. This is a midweight Euro with almost no rules overhead and a lot of interesting decisions to be made. 

It's not like the game's a looker, but the interactions are interesting and there are interactions, which is more than you can say for most euros! This is a smooth game that's a nice mid-to-light weight Eurogame.

Clean mechanics and gameplay.  This game does nothing unique but is elegant to play with some nice touches particularly in managing your hand and purchasing new cards which double up as new actions and victory conditions.  I'm interested to see how multiple plays affect the rating. My gut says this will not drop below a seven.

RATING: 9
Good: The experience of playing is wonderful.

Bad: Because everyone has to buy cards to get VP multipliers, and because the strategies that work for different VP categories tend to overlap a fair amount, a lot of differentiation between strategies is just a question of tactics, whereas I'd prefer a more open strategic landscape.

12+ plays / 2,3,4,5 players (2h-2.5h)

LIKE: Good decision tree, between obtaining cards for actions or points. Some fun elements of engine building. Smaller maps are better as they create more tension for building (Italy was good w/3 & 4). Variable setup. Easy to learn because your actions are on the cards.

DISLIKE: Dry. Difficult to get to the table, until people are familiar with how enjoyable the game is.

OVERALL: You really have to balance your resource engine, but it seems there aren't any bad moves, only moves that are more efficient, so a very forgiving game. Tighter maps lead to better interaction. Point deduction on the rating because the game has a dry theme, but otherwise a fun game.

Exceedingly well designed, tight economy and tough choices in hand management. There are several paths to points and they hinge on taking advantage of opportunity while making your way progressively (and quickly!) across the map. Plays fine with 2, but better with 4 - although a full table of 5 might feel too crowded. Incredibly good game - feels like a classic to me.

Juegaco. Varias partidas a 3, 5 y 2 jugadores. Escala muy bien, y eso es complicado encontrar (2 mapas ambos lados 2-3-4j o 3-4-5j). Juego de mecánicas muy sencillas (en tu turno, juegas una carta y haces su acción) pero luego el juego tiene bastante profundidad, y no es fácil dominar. Juegazo de los mejores eurogames. Este diseñador, Mac Gerdts, no defrauda :D

Concordia is an excellent game in which the key is to phase your own actions so that you are always one step ahead of other players' but in sync with yours.  The game revolves around constructive actions that all inevitably take the game closer to its finish. There are no negative actions, which creates an atmosphere that can be enjoyed by almost anyone. Player interaction is based on blocking, leeching and being the first to do something. And the game is very interactive, it just is not of the "In Your Face" type. 

After the game you have a feeling that you actually accomplished something since, you can see everything you bought right in front of your eyes. And you can achieve quite a bit, which is refreshing after all the games with very tight economy. The dramatic arc has a nice curve and the game picks up some speed towards the end in an predictable manner. 

I have to admit that the theme is rather generic and the game does not look exciting at all. If you can get past this, Concordia offers an enjoyable experience in hand and resource management. It is not a revolutionary game in any way, or a game that will be found in every home for that matter, but it simply works like a charm.

It's solid, enjoyable and pretty unoriginal.  I like the art work, it plays well and I would happily play it again wothout being tempted to buy it.  I guess its fault may be that it's a bit repetitive in terms of what you do and that the start is very slow and the end very fast....which is a bit like Antike.  But I think this is much better than Antike since it does not have Kingmaker issues.

Very elegant Euro game with an interesting hand management element.  Reminds me of Lewis and Clark, though I like Concordia better.  With five players, there can be times when you have your next several moves planned and it makes the down time between turns seem overly long, but this doesn't happen too often.  Despite that, I still like the game quite a bit.

Not wowed by the 2p game. The board was loose, and interaction therefore minimal, although the ability to use your opponent's cards is a very nice touch that extends your deck.

Good game. Not magical, and probably better with 4-5, which would surely make for a tighter, more competitive board. However, I'm unlikely to see that player count very often, if at all.

[u]Also with[/u]: Britannia/Germania board. Hoping this will tighten up the flab that plagued the base game maps.

Concordia is a dry euro game where you get goods and convert them into more valuable things. You also move ships and people on a map to build houses which produce goods. Anyway, the game is elegant: the rules are only four pages and the card system (kinda deck building) provides a very deep and complex game. However, I fear that this game might be a bit too dry for my game group.

Really enjoyed my play, but like many engine-building games, I don't understand what happened or why I placed where I did at the end.  I just kinda did whatever seemed like it made sense and figured out what happened after.

I would gladly play again, and it would likely take 3-4 more plays before I actually understand how to plan multiple turns ahead or how to have actual strategy, as opposed to short-sighted tactics.

An excellent game -- Mr. Gerdts has done it again!  This time his infamous rondel is found in how you play your hand of cards.  It's interesting how the cards drive the game.  You want to produce goods to sell and/or spend goods to get more cards to score more points but you need to keep with the produce/consume to do anything at all.

I want to learn more about the strategies with this game.  I'm still very much at a loss as to optimal paths.  But then so much depends on which cards you get and where the goods markers are on the map...

There's definitely a potential for the rating (currently an 8) to go up.  Probably tops out at a 9 for me.  Great game but not quite making my top 10 (so to speak).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Mac Gerdts is my favorite game designer. His games always surprise me for being so easy to teach and play and yet so deep and rich in strategy and tactics. Concordia is no exception.

Artwork and components match the usual good quality of PD-Verlag's products. The graphic design might not be as crispy as, say, Asmodee's games but it's always functional, easy to the eye and esthetically pleasing. I actually even kinda like the box art and I don't understand why people are hating so much on it. On the mechanisms front instead, while Concordia abandons the rondel, its card-play mechanism doesn't move very much away from the smaller actions and low downtime format that is Mac Gerdts' signature. I like this a lot about his games, but I think that in Concordia the typical snappiness of turns is not as strong and that there's more downtime in this game compared to his other titles.

On the game-play side of things Concordia falls again in some of Gerdts' typical characteristic. The game is less about trying out different strategies and more about implementing those strategy better and more efficiently than the other players. On one hand this means less variety of experiences and on the other one it provides you with a great challenge every time. Concordia is really an "easy to learn, hard to master" kind of game. Another strong point in its favor as far as I'm concerned!

Yet, strangely enough, even if Concordia is the one game that doesn't have the rondel and therefore should be the most diverse of its titles, somehow it's the one that gives me the feel of being too similar to his other works. I maybe see to much of Navegador in it. It could also be that I played it last among his other games. Nonetheless this brings my enjoyment of Concordia a little bit down. Fortunately the Salsa expansion added quite a bit of new content to the base game, increasing its variety and spicing things up by giving players access to cool special powers. I like the game more with this expansion.

To sum up Concordia has all the great characteristics of a Gerdts' design that I enjoy so much. Quick turns, tough decision, great depth. Just I don't enjoy it as much as Imperial or Antike, because it feels just a tiny bit derivative. Still good game though, especially if you include the expansion... and let's face it: Mac Gerdts never truly misses!

Rating without the expansion: 7

:what: :what: :) :) :yuk:

Impressions after one, 3p play: depth is not emergent, relying instead more on a convoluted set of cards and trading economy. Taxing by making you figure out how to line up 27 different things just-right to make them work, and I don't think a single coin negates the early-mover advantage (at least on the map I played, where the starting locations were basically in a corner). Scoring coming entirely from card-buying things with tiny images on the other end of the table... also not great design, IMO.

Would grudgingly play again, but probably at no more than 4p, and preferably 3, and have many better games of this depth and length to choose from. But it's so blah for something in the top 50; at times, it felt a bit more like doing inventory management than having fun. 

I'm sure if I could actually be bothered to learn all the stupid cards and commit to memory all the exchanges and building costs, I'd like it a little more. But probably only a little.

This game is a great example of deep strategy from a very simple ruleset. The game has a good progression from early-mid-end game, and can be quite tense at any stage, provided one uses the appropriate map for each player count (Corsica is great for 2p, for instance).

Although I love this game, it has some caveats to mind : the game can be a bit dry for some players. I also lasts surprisingly long for its apparent simplicity. The scoring at the end can also be a turn off for some players, since it's pretty opaque, at least for inexperienced players.

Had been wanting this for quite a while, added it to my wish list when I heard it might be getting reprinted in time for Christmas.  Glad I did.  Lookin forward to getting this one to the table.

Played with 3 and 5 players so far. Enjoyed very much with both player counts. Each play has left me feeling like I learned a bit about another layer of strategy the game has to offer. Glad to be able to say it has lived up to my expectations. Looking forward to getting Salsa and some more maps, but still a great experience with just the base game.

RATING: 8.75
The theme is definitely there, albeit not heavily; and the beautiful art certainly adds to the themeing. It just feels "Roman", whatever that means! But to say it's "dripping with theme" would, admittedly, be like saying the moon is covered with lush kelp forests.

As for Concordia being a deck-builder, it's far more of a deck-management game, and does that very well. Gone is Herr Gerdt's rondel, of which I am not at all a fan. Curiously, the playing of cards is remarkably similar to Lewis&Clark; yet in spite of that, the two games are utterly different!

It is a strategic game with a strong chaser of tactics, that keeps the players on their toes and ensures a great deal of replayability. There is an element of multi-player solitaire in Concordia, but really, that's only because no one can attack you directly. Your opponents are actually very annoying, although that it is due almost exclusively to the "Hey! You took my spot/card!" phenomenon. 

Negatives? Only two, really. Since you can't really see what kind of multiplier cards your opponents have, there can be an element of guess-work as to how they're doing. And by the way: if it is your first game, you simply MUST play it with the intermediate-scoring rule! That helps a lot, since it painfully reveals the reality of how scoring works in the game. Without it, you will be in for some nasty surprises at game-end. But, if each player has played Concordia at least once, there's really no need for it.

The second negative is that Concordia is just a smidgeon too long for what it offers you. Other than that, it is a wonderfully deep game with a mere four pages of rules!

Concordia isn't really all that complex or groundbreaking, but I find it to be a particularly pleasant Euro. I think it's neat that Gerdts managed to basically design another rondel game without a rondel. The card play gives you a nice sense of pacing with your actions.

The game is at its weakest when players pay very little  attention to what the others are doing. It's at its strongest when players pay attention to the VP goals others are going for and fight over getting relevant cards from the queue for screwage and VP gains.

Basically, the game is interesting when it's a struggle over competing VP goals with a little bit of "hate drafting" of what the other players want, and it's a bit boring if played as the dreaded "multiplayer solitaire." But it's easy to drift into the MP solitaire mode because of how intuitively the game invites you to just putz around building up your little economic industry on the board  w/o focusing on the VP battle. Plus, more players (it goes up to 5) adds more chaos and makes it more difficult to engage with what others are doing.

Uno de los juegos que más me ha sorprendido en este año 2014. Es elegantísimo: sólo puedes hacer una cosa en tu turno: jugar una carta. Pero es que además sólo empiezas con 7. Parece mentira lo que puede dar de si un juego aparentemente tan simple como este. Menos es más. Lo peor sin duda, la portada. A tener en cuenta que a dos las partidas pueden ser algo sosas porque no haya demasiada disputa. Para solucionar esto, venden un mapa mucho más ajustado: Britania.

Love the flow of this game, where there are no turns or rounds, just a series of actions in turn order until the game reaches an end state. Want to play again pretty badly, and would love to see how salsa adds to the game, though I am not entirely convinced it even needs it.

later: salsa is entirely unnecessary and I actually think it dilutes the experience somewhat.

Preliminary: It plays smoothly and has a very interesting deck-building (while not really, as buying cards isn't really "bloating" your deck). The balance between focusing on your tracks and trying to broaden a bit (and get those useful action cards) is pretty interesting, if it feels a bit dry.

It did feel a bit too open with just two, though, and with the cards on selection being a bit constrained without much competition otherwise on the map.

Concordia may have dispensed with the rondel, yet it has Mac Gerdts' signature all over it. There are still the single action player turns thanks to action cards.  Concordia is also a well-developed game with no sharp edges or clunky mechanisms.  Like Navegador it feels a highly abstracted design that happens to be played out on a map.  

The innovation this time is handbuilding, picking up cards from a face-up row of reducing cost.  Cards all feature actions, but also a God affiliation that provides a multiplier for vps related to various things.

Concordia feels rather slow to get going - building up from almost nothing in incremental steps - and very slow to end.  It's not helped by a feeling of same old, same old collecting resources and converting them into victory points.

There is nothing exceptional about the artwork, but it is fairly pleasing to the eye.  Production quality is good.

Pretty easy to play once you get into it.

This game is simple and elegant and at the same time wonderfully brilliant in its mechanism. I love how the gameplay flows, but you need at least 1 game to get the feel for the scoring of different gods. I'm a big fan of it and its art.

The ugly box cover kept me away from this forever, but it is a REALLY good game. The art in the box ain't that bad either (though the cards could use icons to go along with the text). Look forward to playing it with Salsa

Everything appears to be present and correct in terms of balance, playability, multiple strategies etc, etc, & it's a very solid, enjoyable, if not outstanding euro. One thing - something about it felt familiar in concept to Taj Mahal (admittedly this is probably just me - the card play was different but the routes, scoring etc struck me this way). Anyway, the upshot was it made me want to play Taj Mahal.

Some games you just play and you can SEE the amazingly intricate game design at work. Yes the theme is dry and Im not usually into economic games but this one is a real winner. Easy to learn but difficult to master. I love slowly spreading out my empire and constantly crossing paths with my opponents. You are active every turn of this game and it is surprisingly fast paced. I also love that the scoring basically implies that you should be focusing on EVERYTHING in the game.

Like a loooong slog through thigh deep mud, only to arrive just as someone beats you to it. Which wouldn't be so bad if it didn't take several turns to set up for every move. Then you can try something else if you have the correct resources, or go on with your plan if you have the money to pay double. Cards cannot be counted on as by the time your turn rolls around it may be a completely new set and not ones you can afford or even use. Locations may favor the start players and that may or may not be mitigated by the "double prizes" for the last player. Almost no way to plan ahead. Given the random board setup and rotating cards, I would argue there is luck involved. Luck in turn order vs. board lay out and how the cards come out. Played 2 games, one 4 player and one 5 player. Won one, lost one. I don't hate Euros by any stretch, but you could not pay me to play this one again! Pure torture.

RATING: 7
This is a solid, intelligently designed euro that offers many respectable paths to victory.  The card play and deck building, with dual use aspects to the cards (card effect and end game VP multiplier) feels interesting to think about, and is perhaps the most "originalish" aspect to the game. (As an aside, I prefer the dual use aspect of the cards in Snowdonia - effect and VP win conditions.) 

Unfortunately, for my tastes, the rest of the game, the overall feel of the game, feels tired, like an essentially themeless placement of wooden houses around a map of europe, which after the hundredth time of doing this sort of thing in a euro game, I find boring.  And, of course, there is resource planning, and resource conversion, in order to place these houses on a map of europe or buy cards that help me. Yawn, boring! Gameplay is also a bit too solitary for my tastes.  Are we actually interacting here?  Barely. 

I greatly respect the intelligence and integration of the design mechanics in the game; they probably deserve an 8.  This is a masterful standard euro mechanic design.  But the tired, (let's be honest) themeless, solitaire gameplay in Concordia knocks this game down to a 7.  I barely want to play Concordia again, so that means I should probably give it a 6.  But, I am holding out hope that the second play will brighten my perspective on this game, so gonna give it a 7.

I can see why this game is rated so highly given its deep decision making and streamlined play mechanism.  I spent too much time having no clue how well I was doing or if my moves were coming together to really enjoy myself.  I'd play it again, but it will never be a favorite of mine.

RATING: 7
The rules of this game are simple and elegant, but the decisions to be made are quite complex. The card play mechanic is great and requires a lot of strategizing and timing. Because of the elegance of the rules, it is easy to play. Thematically the game is very dry and almost totally abstract, but it has nice components and a beautiful map. Some complaints: 1) Even the Italy-map is too sparse with two players, so there is no confict at all in terms of map play; 2) It would be more fun if there were more thematic immersion; 3) The end game scoring is so difficult to predict that it takes away from strategy and interaction as it's almost impossible to predict your opponents' scores. It is a nice and elegant game, but the cleanliness of mechanics and play comes with the expense of immersion. The designer improved the design in every way in Transatlantic.

Fun factor: 3/5
Strategy vs. luck: 4/5

RATING: 9.7
An easy to teach, hard to master euro with really good, elegant and intertwined mechanics that will let you pursue many different paths to victory, but requires surgical precision to juggle its many facets successfully.

The game consists of players taking turns playing exactly one card. You typically have between 3 and 9 distinct cards available to play each turn. Some have one simple effect while others further require you to make more decisions. But one thing remains constant: each decision is hard and matters.

You need to carefully develop your board and get the cards that will let you translate that tempo into victory points. If you get too greedy with the board or too greedy with the cards you will lose. You should balance getting diverse resources and money. If you get too greedy and neglect that cheap brick and grain it will come back and haunt you later. If you don't sell excess goods you will run out of space and money. If you don't balance resources and money you won't be able to expand through the map or get victory point cards.

One neutral, or controversial point, is the lone end of game scoring round. It is really hard to keep track of how well or bad players are doing, so first time players will feel lost in that regard. It is also harder to prioritize which player to block, bully or leave alone (which can be both good and bad). But it also good in that bad players won't feel like they are facing an insurmountable wall (at least until the end when they get kicked hard!). After a few playthroughs you will stop shooting in the dark and be more aware of how to win and strategize (and agonize) even more about the decisions you make. It will definitely shine with a regular playgroup and more experienced players, specially with the salsa expansion, that gives a wild resource to be used as if it came with the core game, optional starting variable powers, optional rewards for using the tribute card and a map that will take the total to 4, each best suited for each player count, ordered by city quantity.

Pros:
-Simple but deep game
-Cards as action selection and victory points is great.
-Resource storage and generation mechanics are excellent.
-All mechanics are great by themselves and together.
-It can provide a good experience for newbies and veterans.
-It has a very high replay value due to its randomized start, region bonus resource, available cards to buy, initial turn order giving distinct advantages, different feel at each player count (diplomat and prefect magnus become more important as player count increases and the maps become tighter), and not to mention optional variable starting powers and tribune rewards.

Cons:
-Box art and box font are bad, and a bit unappealing to people checking out your collection and deciding what to play, or in a store and deciding what to buy.
-You want to consider an extra cost for redoing the box cover.
-I think that the salsa expansion is critical for the game, so add its cost.
-The coin denomination of 2 is useful but redundant, and confusing because it is copper, which is typically the color of denomination 1 in most other games. The coin of 1 and 5 are silver, so I may have mistakenly paid the copper one as having a value of 1 instead of its printed 2.
-The maps should be a bit tighter in my opinion. Between 20 and 30 cities makes 2 player games feel to open and 5 player games too tight. I would like a map with 10 cities so 2 players can feel crowded.

I could keep talking about how good the mechanics all day, but the same can be said for how bad the box art is, or its font. It really scares away people and takes almost a point down from what could be a masterpiece. It is, at least mechanically. It just makes sense of how both combine to make this a sleeper home run.

Elegant, beautifully themed euro about trading in the Mediterranean, Roman-style. A handful of diverse but simple mechanics fit together smoothly and thematically. There are many routes to victory, and a delicious tension between expanding your trade empire (your goods-producing engine) and acquiring cards that dictate both how you'll score points and the flexibility of your actions. There's no direct conflict, but a great deal of interaction comes from the race for cities and rivalry over buying cards. The variable assignment of bonus tiles to provinces, variable location of cities, and order in which the cards come out of the draw deck means every new play is fresh.

Concordia is probably tied with Puerto Rico as being my favorite game ever.  It's so elegantly designed that anyone can just start playing while the depth adds a ton of replay value and interesting decisions to make.  Also the game feels very balanced and any mistakes in play are clearly recognizable and analyzed.

Nice game, lots of scoring possibilities. Disadvantage: unless you keep a mental count, you don't know how well you are doing until the end!

Make sure you buy enough extra cards, they are multipliers and affect your score in an amazing way.

I played it with 3 but I think it would be better with four players, this should generate more interaction.

Thank you! No roundel. Love this game. One of our favorite Euros. And despite what the rules say you can easily play 2-player on the Empire side of the board without it bogging down the game or making it too easy for anyone. It's a must have in our opinion. There is one thing about this game that baffles me. And it is in other Euros as well. If scoring only occurs at the end of the game, why is there a scoring track on the board?

At the time of this writing and night of playing, this game is ranked 49th at BGG. 49th?! While executed well, I find it to be a pretty milquetoast Euro with no real hooks added. Plenty of games have hooks that I hate, but I can easily see how others love them. This, it's a damned mystery what the demographic is for people that love this game. Anyway, I do think it's nice enough. We played with five in a loud convention-style room, and I think the sweet spot would be a quiet four. It's okay?

Such elegance...Concordia must be my favorite 'trading in the Mediterranean game', and my first experience with a Mac Gerdts design. The catch is, with expansion maps you can avoid the Mediterranean part. A load of strategy off playing a single card per turn, each one lets you produce goods, score money, travel the landscape, and lay down houses in cities. The variable setup is intuitive and wonderful, the board beautiful, the player warehouse boards give it a tactile edge, and I don't really have much of an issue with the cover art work as many seem to do. Scoring is surprisingly deep with the Personality cards often allowing you to double or further multiply, and there are other cards that can affect scoring. Just all around wonderful.

This is probably my favourite game. It is so easy to teach to new players and the strategy in it is so quick to pick up that new players will find themselves scoring almost as much as experienced ones. To close the gap between new and experienced players the strategy you choose will reward you in points in the end, as cards also acts as points multipliers which most times rewards the actions on the card. 

I find it heavy enough to challenge me, but light enough to ensure that I can play more games afterwards, which is what is important to me.

Lovely production, great to have two very different feeling maps available, which does wonders with preventing the game to feel stale before its time.
The game is rather hard to get into the very first time. No idea what makes a good strategy. You learn very swiftly, though, so this isn't a problem for long. It doesn't have as much of engine building as I'd expected, but also doesn't really need it. Feels like a mix of Power Grid and Navegador. Positioning is very important - as is always having a backup plan. Beyond that the game seems to be won mostly by making optimal use of your cards, and just eking out small advantages until they can snowball into the lead in a few settlements or cards. Both lovely and elegant.

At last a non-rondel game from Mac Gerdts.  The rondel was a very clever innovation, which has subsequently been widely adopted and adapted.  Concordia is a solid design, but feels uninspired compared with the many new fresh ideas now being published.  It feels like a throwback to the nineties.  In the game we add bases and expand our network, acquire cards with VP multiples.  And then continues in the same vein until the end of the game.  The introduction of a nominal early scoring round in your first game (only I recall), which is largely wiped clean, was a very clever mechanism to make new players familiar with the scoring requirements.  But with a pile of other Spiel 2013 releases to get through, we called it a day after 90 minutes as we felt we had experience what the game had to 'offer' at that point.

The Meaty, clever, Euro game you expected that takes ancient roman economics to the next level!

Well maybe not a whole level up, but the game is a great example of what this sort of game can bring to your table.  

Players start with a hand of cards (not a deck) which drive the action in the game.  With these cards players can colonize cities, produce goods, and add more cards to their hand.  Since players never draw from a deck, they never have to wait for a particular card to emerge and the timing is strictly under their control.

Components are nice (the map looks great), just try and look past that box art which is probably one of the worst in the business.

4 rondellás után ez az első nem rondellás, amit a szerzőtől játszottam (nem sok ilyet készített eddig). Le sem tagadhatná, hogy az ő játéka, csak épp az akcióválasztás lett kicsit változatosabb (rondella helyett saját paklinkból válogatunk, amit közben fejleszthetünk is). Egyébként minden a szokásos: a jól bevált dobozméret, a böhöm nagy kétoldalas tábla, körben a tök széles pontozósávval, amit csak a legvégén használunk:) Ennyi meg még néhány egyszerű akció nagyon jól összeválogatva, és már kész is van. Az összes eddig próbált játékából ez az egyik legletisztultabb. Rövid szabály, gyors, pörgős a játék, 4 személyes lement szabállyal együtt másfél óra alatt. Kombó-imádó emberek előnyben:)
Összességében elégedett vagyok, azt kaptam kb. amit vártam, szerintem még kicsit jobb is mint a rondellások átlaga, bár fura, hogy épp a védjegye hiányzik.

I can see why this game is popular, but it isn't my cup of tea. I think I prefer games with stronger connection to the historical theme it purports to represent. In essence, Concordia is a game of resource gathering, smatterings of area control and card-victory point collection. A Euro in every sense, it could be set anywhere and anytime, not just Ancient Rome. 
It's a tight game with good mechanics, but I find it a bit too much like book-keeping/bean counting with theme pasted on. I've tried to like it, but it feels just a bit too sterile for my tastes.

Quite interesting hand-cards management game with a constant struggle to produce resources, sell them for money, in order to build houses that may give resources...
Each card gives you an ability, and one of them allows to recover the discarded.  You also get new cards, so that your hand increases.  
Scoring is a totally unknown during the game.  Each card is associated to a divinity, and each divinity scores for a different concept of the game.  So it is absolutely impossible to know what each player has.
It was not easy for me to "flow the game" in the first time, but looks interesting.

After one play: very solid game, enjoyed it quite a bit and definitely want to play more. I like subtle interactions that are limited to drafting personality cards, making building more important if somebody has already built there before you, and using other players' top discard card using a Diplomat action. If you prefer greater interaction it's not a game for you, but it seems just fine for my euro taste. I also enjoyed hand management, trading resources with the "bank" and the fina scoring with various multipliers.

I love both versions of Imperial. Navegador is good, and I quite like every other rondel game designed by Mac Gerdts.
So I was a bit puzzled when I heard the "rondel master" would publish a game without his signature mechanic.

In Concordia, the rondel has been replaced with a deck of cards. Each player has an identical starting deck, but he can add different cards buying them from a display (à la Through the Ages), diversifying the options for later turns AND giving him special scoring bonuses for the end game. So when acquiring cards, one must always balance the need to add a given action OR a given scoring bonus.

During each turn, a player chooses one of the cards of his deck (all cards in the deck are in hand), plays if for the effect and discards it. Discarded cards can't be played again until a special card is played that allows to recover the discards.
This mechanic is clever and well implemented, and the game has lots of interesting decisions.

The goal of the game is building a commercial and influence network in the Roman world (on in Italy, if playing with just 2-3 players), sending colonists to settle different cities and establish commercial/production colonies.

Overall, the game is very very good. Possibly one of the best released at Essen Spiele 2013.

Initial tentative rating is an 8.

Wow, where to start....this game is just the epitome of elegance.

Simple to teach, deep to play

The board and components are beautiful, it never outstays it welcome. 

Just fantastic!

But........there's something not making it great,  but I can't put my finger on it and it kind of feels like 'The Emporers New Clothes' syndrome with all the hype for the game.

I largely suspect because I don't really understand the strategy even after 10+ plays, but a voice inside me says...'is there a strategy to this?' Mmmmmm...love playing it though.

Initial Impression: This is a solid euro which is light in theme and mechanisms. The artwork makes the game seem busier and more complex than it really is. The rules are simple, play a card and perform its action. At its heart, this game is about being more efficient in your turn than your opponents in order to squeeze out that extra resource. I enjoy the fact that the end game point salad is fairly well hidden, which nullifies the "bash on the leader" mentality. I can see this making a good gateway game.

RATING: 8
A good game in the tradition of Mac Gerdts. Although it makes me think of Antike, it's a complete other game, but I think it's because of the material in the box. In the middle of the game, you have to choose which way you want to go.

Played w/o Salsa as of now. Wow. It plays so smooth and is beautifully balanced. It works so well, has depth and is, yet, simple. Concordia is just great. I look forward to upping the complexity a bit once we integrate Salsa after 6-12 more plays. This game is the first one that may reach a 10 for us.

Edit, Aug, 2017: This game is simply the best of its type of euro-game. The amount of replayability and engagement the game provides with its simple rule set and mechanisms is amazing. If there was one critique, it is that the cards you purchase for your hand are primarily chosen for end-game scoring and not as a way to significantly change the "rondel" of your hand of cards.

Fun game in which the cards you hold in your hand become your "rondel." You can add cards to your hand at any time and can play a card to reclaim any cards that you have already played (sort of a pass action with the important additional option to build an additional worker). This is a typical Mac Gerdts game where asynchronous play can really pay off.

Absolutely love this brain-burner of a game.  Every action matters: when you play your cards, where you build your cities, what you buy with your resources, etc.  One wrong move or one card out of order can make all the difference.  And you never, ever, *ever* have the items you so desperately need when you need them.

Fantastic.

RATING: 6
My enthusiasm for this game waned after my most recent play. It became clear that the better players had internalized the relative values of every card and resource, and then the game became around positioning and incentive management.

Sounds great, right? The problem is that I have a hard time sussing out the relative values, and thus I'm choosing my long-term strategy relatively arbitrarily. And the amount of plays it would take for me to get there is more than I am comfortable committing to, when there are so many other games I am enthusiastic about.

OLD COMMENT: Much more interesting than I had thought from initial reviews. Need to play it a couple more times to give it a fair assessment. Three players seems too spread out to have good shared incentives. Probably needs four on the small map or five on the big map.

RATING: 7
A good management game, fluid and relatively accessible but not transcendent.

Actions are selected using a card at your turn, you can buy new card during the game. These cards are also associated with a god which will give point in the end of the game .

Multiple ways to score points : be present in differents countries, have a counter in different cities, unlock its boats and men, have money in the end part (even if it really is anecdotal), have counters producing a maximum of different resources and some others elements. All these points are multiplied by the number of cards of a certain god that was on your hand at the end of the game.

I did not really like the use of the cards to make points throughout the game we do not know who is in the lead because it is impossible to accurately calculate the score of each player. (unless you have an extraordinary memory and the time to do it...). So each one plays in his corner, and it is impossible to try to block a minimum the leader.

At 5 players, the game is relatively long and sometimes you will just wait your turn to take back yours cards in your hand.

Big fan of the action management system as well as the multiple paths to points. Good game for other people who aren't overly fond of conflict due to the games resource system. I do enjoy the mystery of who is winning at any given time, though you can keep tabs on the scores by being vigilant of what others are doing. One game during scoring, I was dead last by 60 or so points 'till my specilized purchases came up, zooming to the front and sealing the win by 10. The scoring process is thrilling in that regard.

Very ingenious design. Deckbuilding elements but the cards you purchase go into your hand. So, there isn't a random shuffle and draw of the deck involved. Rather than a deckbuilder, it is more like a hand/action selection builder. Plus, not only are you developing your available actions throughout the game, but you are also creating your own scoring conditions that goes along with your strategy. Really provides multiple paths to victory. Rewards those that can plan two or three moves ahead.

First Play: Rules are extremely simple to understand and so we launched into the game very quickly. It soon becomes evident that there is a rhythm to producing, and building which gives you a feeling of never being able to do exactly what you want, when you want to. There are a number of beautifully subtle balancing issues, new Cities vs Colonists, Cards vs production. Also the need to keep an eye on what opponents are doing to duplicate a key card and stop them gaining from yours.

For me the best game from Essen so far. Need to play this again quickly.

While the theme is overused (it's literally trading in the Mediterranean) the game itself is fantastic. The mechanics of the game are fairly simple which means it's also pretty easy to teach but the strategy can be pretty deep. I love how there's a good amount of player interaction. Building cities and occupying routes is the primary way but even the way the Diplomat cards work gets players always aware of each other's actions too. Turns tend to be pretty quick so downtime isn't much of an issue. Having two maps in the box along with a variable board setup means this game scales well and has lots of replay value. And the cards! Using cards as the way you score is just genius as it creates a real tension about expanding on the board vs using resources/actions to get more cards. Everyone should give this game a try.

Love Concordia. Simple to play, tough to master. The random setup and double-sided game board means you'll be playing this for some time before it gets old. Okay, the box is ugly. But the components are outstanding, and the board is beautiful. Doesn't suffer near as much from AP as other's in the genre, and tends to play faster as players become more familiar with the cards. In my opinion, a Catan killer.

Great game. My favorite Mac Gerdts game by a wide margin. Instead of a rondel, you have a line of cards that once purchased, go into your hand and be used to get goods and other abilities. Also, the cards have different scoring bonuses at the end of the game. A lot of really neat things going on here. I prefer it with 2 as I think the A.P. issues with 3 or more would be excessive.

The AxB scoring mechanism coupled with no scoring track usage during the game leads to blowouts if the players are not all very diligent.

The game should have better information imho, it's simply too much work to keep track of otherwise.

This is currently my favorite game. Such a joy to play, at any player count. It moves fast, it flows beautifully, and I just overall enjoy the experience every time.

I really adore this game for creating interesting gameplay and very tough decisions with such a simple ruleset. The theme is not that original nor is the art very good. The gameplay more than makes up for that. Interaction is mostly indirect and most of it is even positive. Getting resources when someone else uses the Prefect or using the Diplomat to copy a much needed action from an opponent. But there will certainly be times when your fellow gamers will make you wanna punch them. Building just where you was going to build and thereby making it too expensive for you or buying the cards you needed so badly just before you were going to.

All in all a great euro that's easy to learn and will give you lot's of replayability. This will be even more improved with the expansions. The new maps and especially the Salsa expansion will spice up the game even more.

This is a Mac Gerdts design that has a similar feel to some of his previous incarnations; albeit without a Rondel. Instead of a Rondel to choose actions, the new innovative concept encompasses cards that are used in a quasi deck/hand building manner to perform actions. 

You start with a set number of cards, but can buy more in an open market. Not only do the cards grant you more actions, but they also supply you with victory points at the end of the game dependent on fulfilling requirements stated on the cards.(e.g. houses built, provinces settled, type of goods you produce, number of workers on the map). The cards also have a victory point multiplier effect.

The entertaining aspect of the game is that while you are building your engine and spreading your dominion throughout the map, you want to acquire cards that bestow you points based on what you are doing. It is easy to lose sight of the bigger picture while building your engine.

Concordia is an elegant middle weight design with simple rules, thoughtful decisions, just the right amount of player interaction and a good dose of strategical depth. If you are a fan of Gerdts' designs, this won't disappoint.

I've played it with 3, 4 and 5 players.  It's a good game and I prefer it with more players since it creates more tension on the board.  If I were playing with 4 again, I'd use the smaller map to tighten things up again.  I'm not sure I'd play with 3 players again.

Even though it is a fairly new game, there is just a "classic" feel about it that we have really enjoyed. Highly recommended!

An interesting economic and set collection game.  The game is rondel-esque in that you have a hand of role cards and cannot re-use them until you play your Tribune card to get the used cards back.  That said, you can purchase more role cards to duplicate or modify your hand of roles.  It has  some area control aspects (benefits for owning businesses in certain regions) and a double-sided board to adjust the difficulty based on player count.  My impressions are currently favorable because it seems to have the right balance of luck, strategy, and player interaction.

The way everything is intricated is brilliant. The deck building, the area control, resource management and the best part for me... the set collection. 

The game is pretty simple: you play a card, you execute the actions writen in the card, next player. Quick turns, where what other players do, do matter for your next actions, so you'll be entertained all the time. 
The interaction in Concordia is above average (comparing to this kind of games). Some cards replicate what other players do, other cards are worth of activating when other players do some actions first, etc etc

Strategy wise has depth, without being overcomplicated. By the end of the game it can be AP prone for some players, but not much of a big deal.

It's not that long and it plays well with the max amount of players.

Love this game!

This game is really tight and I love how all the mechanisms in it come together smoothly.  Unfortunately, it was a bit dry for myself and the people I played with.  I thought it was going to be a hit once I saw how light the rule book is, but I think the depth of the game is in the strategy and some players weren't able to grasp it.  Needed a few more plays, but would rather play something else.

It's a bit open for my tastes, having way too many ways to score and not enough direction. The opposite of 'keeping your eye on the ball'. I also felt on too many turns whatever I wanted to do was so many turns away. You can be placed in an awkward rough position easily in this game, where you're constantly struggling to catch up. I'd play it again, but I have no urge to seek it out to play again.

Another Mac Gerdts design. Enough for me as a recommendation. Looking forward to a first play...
++++++
Finally on the table, with three players (Italy map). All new to the game but as expected it is not hard to pick up and play moved along briskly. On the other hand, it is the kind of game where you need to play a couple of times to see how the dynamics evolve. Understanding the scoring is key and even after nodding our heads at the explanation, and understanding the multiplier nature of the Character Cards, the final scores after our first game brought a few surprises. It will be interesting to see how this experience will influence our future plays.

While the random seeding of the goods-producing cities, and the semi-random way the extra cards come out, is intended to ensure replayability, I think it will only be marginal. The initial fanning out of colonists will vary but once the players have established themselves on short, medium and long term goals the play should follow pretty familiar lines.

We are fans of all Mac Gerdts' designs and this game is solid and straight-forward enough to join those that will likely see play, but I'm wondering about its staying power. I expected that this would fit into the "medium-filler" category for us but the playing time may be somewhat longer than hoped for and may sink it. It is not enough game for the "main course" but may find its place when the main course ends sooner than usual.

Wasn't expecting to like this one - heard it was a dry euro. 

Pleasantly surprised. Little downtime (unless a few players are AP, but then you'll get downtime whatever the game), lots of decisions, lots of control, enough interaction to keep you involved in others turns.

Like it, alot.

An interesting hand builder game.  Played at a decent pace (60 - 90 minutes), I enjoy it.  It's got as much exploration as I like and no conflict.  It's got a neat shared incentive aspect with having markers in the same territories as other players.  I also like that there's a chance to speed up the end game and catch people unprepared.

My only knock on the game is that it's hard to tell who's winning until the end game scoring -- that reinforces the lack of conflict.  With 2 players, it's obvious who your competition is.  With more than 2, the only conflict will be the elbow-swinging variety.

Por lo visto deja las mismas sensaciones que el NAvegador. ME gustó mucho este juego. La partida es una carrera para conseguir multiplicadores que se tienen en cuenta al final de la partida para obtener la puntuación. En cada turno el jugador juega una carta, que ejecuta una acción. No hay rondas de juego. El procedimiento sigue hasta que alguien provoca el final de la partida. Hay varios tipos de carta y cada una de ellas puntúa un aspecto de la partida. Si tienes varias cartas del mismo tipo, la puntuación en ese aspecto se multiplica por el número de cartas. Es fácil de explicar y de jugar. Tiene muchos caminos a la victoria.

Another extremely solid Mac Gerdts offering. Very tight gameplay: you only have one action: play a card. The cards though of course have various actions you can take, and knowing when to use them and which areas to go for are what make the game. The system is incredibly tight, with a wide array of strategic choices, and great player interaction both in getting to build in cities first, and in blocking key locations with your colonists. Like Hamburgum, the game is hampered by what I would say is relatively ugly art, color schemes, average components, and a tired theme. 

The gameplay here is king, however. Need a replay to see if this hits as an 8, but it borders there already.

Initial rating after starting a few games online. Seems solid thus far with some clever mechanics but nothing profound. A bit dry and lacking interaction. Views might change. Update: Dropping from 7 to just under 5. The game isn't that bad to play and mildly entertaining but sadly this is just a processionary, multi-player solitaire rondel with cards-pasted-on-Euro. I feel Gerdts missed a few tricks here - why not allow trading with players to allow some dynamic and interaction? After all it is a "trading in the Mediterranean" game. The game also seems a total lottery in terms of scoring and who wins. I came second in my first game online in a 5 player game vs. experienced players and I didn't know at all what I was doing. Now that I am trying harder and know a bit more I am actually doing worse...

Quite interesting. The limited number of resource spaces, the choice of actions (with even the possibility to copy actions), combined with a bit of deck building make the game quite fun.

I like the action selection mechanism (single cards from a replenishing hand) a great deal, as well as the personality card "tech." It is a super Euro-y game about economic development, with minimal direct conflict. But there is still interesting player interaction, with competition for personality cards and building priority, as well as the action mimicry of the Diplomat card.

The scoring system is unusual and not much susceptible to mid-play mental assessment. That makes the "intermediate scoring" mechanism very important for first-time players: Early in the game, scores are assessed, and then zeroed out, with small money bonuses going to the leaders at that point. In some respects, the scoring system reminds me of a more elaborate version of Kingdom Builder, with its reliance on calculation from the board state after the finish of play. 

I like how the scoring of the cards charts out a large but finite number of major strategies, allowing players to focus on one to three "gods."

RATING: 10
A game where you have nine things you want to do at the same time.  Easy to grok and fun to play - reminds me of a hybrid of Settlers and Power Grid but much more meaty yet easy to teach.  The challenge is to figure out how to get what you need efficiently when your opponents are trying to grab the same things. After four plays I have to say I am really impressed by the variability of the game.  Four players was very different from five players, and the different city and card layout each game will make each game feel diffent.  Grabbing cards early or real estate early will have a huge impact on how the game unfolds.  The intermediate scoring round is unneccessary for gamers just do it all at the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fantastic. Along with Navegador, one of Mac Gerdts's best designs. I suppose deck-building/hand-management Euros are the new rage (e.g. Rococo, Lewis & Clark, City of Iron), but the fact that Concordia involves a map makes this game rise above the others, IMO. On top of the deck building, you have area control, transportation considerations, resource and money management, careful timing of actions to plan (including playing off of other players' actions), and you have to get a sense of the pace of the entire game to maximize end-game scoring. It's a dizzying and bewildering array of things to consider, but despite this, the game feels very light and fast because the turns churn out at a rapid pace.

Be forewarned, though, this is not just a "point salad" game, but a majority of the points are handed out at the end of the game. Until you're more experienced, you may not know who is winning until the winner is actually declared. I love this kind of game because it makes me feel like I'm doing well even when I am sucking royally, but it may turn some people off.

After several plays,  I think it's safe to say that this is one of my favorite games in my collection.  Even at max player count,  the game-play is smooth and the turns move quickly.

RATING: 7
An interesting game, and a bit unexpected for the subject matter!  The game is very Feld-ian, in that nearly everything you do in the game scores you points, and you of course have the goal of scoring the most points, so you're trying to optimize all of your point scoring.

However, the twist is that players have a hand of cards.  Each turn, you'll play a card, which allows you to do something (build civs, trade goods, produce goods, get more guys, etc).  However, the cards also have a point condition at the bottom that says you score for a certain thing.

Each player starts with identical cards, but during the game, you can get more of these cards.  So, not only are you adding actions to your hand that modify your ability to do things vs. the other players, but you are also modifying the way you score your points at the end of the game.  For example, some cards give you 2 points per guy you have.  If you manage to get 3 of these cards, you'll score 6 per guy, so you will want to focus on getting more guys.  However, another player may only have one of these cards, so they're better off working toward other goals.

In the end, you get a good combination of some mild deck building with a good base game that the cards drive.  Looking forward to playing more!

Shut Up & Sit Down really likes this game. I watched their review, and *literally fell asleep*. I then watched a playthrough on BGG Game Night and *fell asleep* again.

That being said, I bought it anyway. /r/boardgames and the two videos were so positive that I thought it'd still be worth a shot.

After our first play, I'm happy to say that the simple gameplay made it relatively easy to teach. There are *so* many options, though, that it's hard to tell what you should do.

On our first game, we didn't really concentrate on scoring. Both Patricia and I were spreading across Italy, staying out of each other's way and creating a trading empire.

The engine building of the game is really fun. Once you start getting a lot of cities and can produce a lot of goods, it feels like the game really starts to open up. However, because we weren't racing to buy cards, the two-player game took two hours. I'm sure we could have ended it sooner.

I hope to play with a larger group and see how it holds up.

Update: Played two more three-player games. The game feels really solid, and now that we're racing for cards, it feels like we're getting better at the game. Both three player games took 90 minutes, including setup.

Hoping to play a five-player game in the future.

There isn't really a way to make this game [i]sound[/i] interesting. On paper, it sounds like any number of interchangeable Euros. But trust me, this is a terrific game. There's just no fat in Concordia - absolute minimal ruleset for maximum depth. There's a ton of tough decisions that only get more agonizing as the game goes on - but since you're limited to one action per turn (and further limited by cards in hand), there's not a lot of AP as players have an entire round to decide which to take (though of course, your opponents' decisions can affect your own!)

So yeah. Just play it. Don't read the description, don't look at the box cover (AVERT YOUR EYES), just play. Play and enjoy. Concordia is a treat.

Update: The more I play this, the more I realize 5p is just too many. The game really starts to drag at that count. If you're all really fast, then I could see it being fine. But personally I think I'll stick to 2-4 if I can (with 2 on the tiny expansion maps).

Simple rules that give the game a nice flow, some deck building, some resource management, some special powers - that's a whole lot of fun gameplay elements, with a theme I think is GREAT for gaming! (I like trading in games, I love the Mediterranean Sea, so it can hardly get any better than "trading in the Mediterranean".)
I also like how often you can only guess who's in the lead and won't know for sure until the very end.

A very smoothly designed game. The rules are straightforward with no ambiguities. 

It does have the feel of a Mac Gerdts game, even though this feels nothing like the rondel to me. Lots of microturns which require multi-step planning, and the winning conditions are often contrary to what you might think based on feel. 

There is mild interaction via diplomat and prefect, and racing to certain cards and locations, but it plays very much like a victory point optimization exercise. There are certain strategies (get all your guys out and the cards for that, get multiple provinces and the cards for that etc.) that it is obvious you must follow to compete. Concordia is in the top tier for this type of game, but playing this a few days after playing Imperial again revealed how limited a game like this is. Overall not bad.

My expectations were most likely too high – I had heard a lot of people claiming that this was as good as or even better than Navegador. However, it’s definitely not. The gameplay is not too interesting and it feels very repetitive. With 5 there is way too much downtime due to AP which means my enjoyment of the game naturally falls a lot. I thought I would like it much more with 3 or 4 (with 2 there wouldn’t be enough interaction and competition), but having played it with 3 too I cannot really say that it makes the game better. Actually there was less interaction due to fewer blocked cities and fewer expensive buildings. It doesn’t take as long as with 5 (about 1½ hours compared to 2½+), but the gameplay is still very repetitive as you kind of need to do some actions in a certain order. What I do like is how you acquire cards during the game and can play them and thereby choose your own actions and when to play them. This “rondel” you “build” out of your cards is quite interesting. You obviously have to keep a close eye on what your opponents do and are able to do as it affects your decisions.

It did kind of suck that the winner in my first 5p game took a lone road/are more or less by himself while others were closer to each other, meaning that the other players had to pay much more for the buildings; of course, that’s a tactical mistake by the other players, but the winning player actually also got no less than 8 cloth from one other player throughout the game – a lot of them at the beginning where he used the bonus action… I have to say that it made me slightly dissatisfied that one player could benefit so much from a suboptimal play by another player… And this mechanic in the game itself is definitely not something I enjoyed. Yes, of course you can build in areas where another player has a couple of houses so you’ll get a benefit when he uses the action where you get goods, but still… The player probably would have won anyway, but it’s not a given as he got a lot of essentially “free” cloth during the first couple of turns. Again, we played poorly, but the game let us do it. My next game didn’t have too much of this, though, so maybe it was just inexperience. 

The end game scoring is nicely done as you can get points in different ways depending on what your strategy is during the game. I like Navegador quite a lot, but Concordia was simply just not my cup of tea as it feels way too repetitive, constraining and, frankly, boring. And this comes from a hardcore eurogamer.

Really abstract and hard to pick up quickly.  But once I finally got going, I liked it well enough.  It is like a rondel game with the cards as the rondel, but it is slower-paced because of the expanded card choices and then the micro-actions that follow after the choice.  I like the rondel games better.

Concordia might be the most stereotypical Euro game I've ever played, but it is fantastic, and I look forward to playing it more.  The artwork and components are great (although I'm still not sold on the shape or material for the "cloth").  The player interaction is also interesting, and the game is pretty easy to learn.

Concordia is the third Gerdts game that I played after Imperial 2030 and Navegador. And, I really like all three. Like the other games, Concordia offers a streamlined set of rules, slick gameplay, and that fast "do an action--next player" flow of a turn.

So, Concordia is his non-rondel game, but the cardplay is still very much like a rondel, only customizable. You never shuffle and draw--all your cards represent your hand, and you choose the order you want to play them.

The customizing your hand is what makes this game different. There's not a market to manipulate per se, you simply cash in and buy resources at the stated price. It's all pretty straightforward, but there's plenty of decision making in the game. 

I want to play this again and I can see myself possibly picking this up at some point.

UPDATE: After a few more plays online, I have finally gotten it and understand the game more and the need to buy cards just as much as building. Striking that balance has been critical for me, and now I enjoy this game and all the different maps. Lots of strategy and planning ahead for such simple turns. I've bought the game again and will continue to play it online.

I fear I went into this game with too much hype. I loved the idea of how Mac's usual rondel was turned into cards but man did I struggle to figure it out. So many cards in your hand really brought out my AP and I had a hard time figuring out what to play each turn. I felt like all the actions I would take were not the best possible because I never had enough money or resources to maximize the card to its fullest. I made the mistake of only getting 1 food and 1 brick city in the game when I should have gotten at least 2 or 3 of each to help get my city building engine going. I really struggled to build things throughout the game and still had 7 buildings at the end while my two opponents completed all of theirs. I ended up losing by 40+ points and just never felt like I understood the strategy to get my engine going. 

After a play with Salsa, I like the game a little bit more but I still struggle with strategy of buying cards versus expanding my empire and always seem to do well in 1 but not the other. I need to find a way to balance both and still be competitive. I'll happily play this game but not one I need to own.

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]An excellent Euro trading game where you build your action deck by purchasing cards that not only give you options during the game, but pay off as end game points.  There's a lot going on but the game is very well balanced and you never feel truly out of it as the points are revealed at the end.

As I started trying to set this up on the table I could lots of groans.  "Oh god, not another game with 500 cards and a million rules!"  After going through the whole 4 pages of the rule book, and after a single turn by everyone, the game was past that phase.  Everything flows so nicely, the rules are really quite simple.  I like the little 'intermediate scoring' phase that kinda reminds everyone what scores points.  I've never had the whole table understand so quickly during a game what they needed to do to win.  Several of my players said they were expecting to hate it as I set it up, but by the time we were done were pleasantly supersized.

You could see how tense of this game generated during play.  Very elegant tactics move each time to utilize the leftover cards, resources and money in order to optimize player's long term strategy.  The Diplomat is also a very shining idea to implement in this game to increase your awareness of your opponents.  The thing that stop me giving it a very high comment is the final scoring.  The final scoring gives a very dramatic changing that can't be easy to predict.

Needless to say, we all can accept and have no expectation about the theme in Euro games.  In terms of theme, it is dry and playing around the Euro mechanics without relating too much about Roma development and colonization.  But It is FUN!  Right?!

Wow. I really the mechanisms and scoring in this one. The design is elegant and straightforward. You simply play a card from your hand, take the card's action and your done. But how to play those cards is the fun of the game. I love the balance of getting more scoring cards while trying to expand your scoring conditions. If you only buy up all the cards, they won't do you anything. If you expand all over the map but don't buy any cards, you also won't score many points. Trying to strike that perfect mix of the two is the challenge.

:sugar: Rock solid design in a lot of ways, certainly a more thoughtful piece of work than a lot of the present worker-placement-with-a-slight twist falling off the assembly line. I struggled to grasp it at first, and then I just struggled to do anything useful. It lacks the compelling theme/mechanic integration of Navegador or Imperial -- unlike those games you're never not conscious of the underlying math problem. This hurts it a little in my estimation, but only a little.

The game is all about maximizing each of your turns. Can I build 4 cities this round? Can I get more money selling goods, flipping the bonus tiles, or playing my Colonist card? Is it more efficient to get wine by Prefecting a province someone else is on or buying it from the market. Some games get more relaxing as you better know how to play them. This one feels tenser as you get better at balancing your turns while trying to stay a step/card/city ahead of your opponents.

There is this rich matrix of strategic elements that combine and fold together: obtaining cards, playing cards, map expansion, resource management. And it is all played out on a beautiful board with the requisite elegant wooden pieces. Eurogames are one of my two favorite game genres and this is one of the best eurogames I've had the pleasure of playing. The visuals are a feast for the eyes and the tapestry of decisons are a feast for the mind. In that respect it pushes the envelope without ever straying into stressful or brain-burning territory. (That certainly has its place and time- it just isn't here.)

Excellent, tight design. Beautiful board. It is very dry in terms of theme, but what else should you expect from a hard-nosed, classically German game? After I played Lewis & Clark for the first time, I hoped we'd see more hand management designs, and this is a great example. I consider it a cousin to Antike in feel even though it is mechanically different.

Hand building, route management, action chaining, resource conversion, production optimization and more... So easy to teach, yet quite interesting and unique in its mechanisms. Very clean, very minimalistic design, to the point where people call it dry. Well dry it is, and low interaction too, but it is an exquisite game that has earned its place at the collection. The various routes to victory are balanced through a clever scoring system, so people feel engaged till the end without a runaway leader feeling. Lovely components, and plays easily well 2-5 players in a short amount of time. One of Mac Gerdt's finest.

RATING: 8.5
There's a great deal of elegance in this game's design. It's relatively simple to learn, yet it's deep enough to provide seasoned gamers with a reasonable challenge. The key to the game lies in the card offer row, and it's all too easy to lose sight of the need to buy up those new cards (which score you VP at the end of the game) when there's so many other important things to be doing. What it ends up becoming is a great big juggling match: new cards vs. new lands vs. production vs. building up money. Since juggling matches are what make games fun, this one's a winner.

In the post-mortem of the first play, we described it as a game where you're interacting with the mechanics. She is very goal oriented and did not like that the goal of the game cannot be summed up in a few words. I am more process oriented, and enjoyed picking which card to play and getting into the rhythm of gameplay. 

There were a couple moments later in the game where I set myself up to play an architect and it was satisfying to lay down 4 cities at once.

I have played this game multiple times on boiteajeux.net and despite the larg intivals between turns, I love the game. It is without doubt the best game I played this year, probably ever.

Concordia uses a reasonably simple set of interacting mechanics to build an incredibly deep game.

So why a 9 not a 10? I considered 10 for a very long time but I cannot award it for three reasons. Firstly, there is a bullshit tie break mechanic, this is most annoying online when you might have been playing for days before losing thanks to a quirk.  Secondly, the visual design of the game sucks: the art is dull, and the game is difficult to use if you are colour blind. Thirdly, nothing is perfect, I don't know if I can ever give a perfect 10.

So a deck-builder is sorta like a rondel? Well, that's what I tell myself, at least, about this gem of a game from the rondel king. I really like that Gerts has used a bit more uncertainty (using that word intentionally rather than luck) in this game compared to previous. The game has nice variation in setup to keep things fresh (more variation than most Gerts games). But it really is a deck builder. But unlike Trains, which is a deck builder with a map that barely matters, this one the map really matters--a lot. That's what you're actually thinking about. And there are (thankfully) [b][i]no card combos[/i][/b]. You simply play one card on your turn. Simple. Fast. Elegant (yes, I'm using that word). 

The scoring in this game is really genius. Every card you get (including your starting 7 base cards) has a god on the bottom. It doesn't affect game play at all. Rather, at the end of the game, you group all your cards by god, and that number is a [i]multiplier[/i] for the scoring condition associated with that god (7 gods, iirc). So when you're buying cards, you're looking mostly at what they do, but also how they score. You can get huge points by specializing. 

Another thing I like relative to most deckbuilders is that rather than having a static menu of cards, it's a sequence, with cards at the new end of the scale getting progressively more expensive than cards at the old end. Plus a cost on the card itself. It works really really well.

I may even bump this to a 9. We'll see. So far just really happy with first play. And I should mention really happy with how simple the core gameplay is: on your turn pick a card from your hand and do what it says. Rinse & repeat. That's it.

Update (11/17): Four years later and Concordia has hit 20 plays. Not sure if I can think of another game of this weight and depth that have shown this type of staying power. I'm definitely a "cult of the new" type of player so this tells me something. The new maps give it a nice variety and keep the game fresh. Rating goes up to a 10.

Update (2/15): A year after initially playing Concordia and my appreciation continues to grow.  It is the top of the class of the Essen releases from 2013. Not many new games of this depth hit 15 plays as quickly as this did. Concordia is variable, deep, and tense. The release of the new board with new maps will keep the game fresh. 

A Gerdts game without the rondel, but still felt like you were using a rondel in the form of an individual deck that you can cycle through as quickly as you choose.  The big difference is you can expand the deck to make it more efficient. One play is not enough to rate, but that play was quite enjoyable.

The less rondel Mac puts in his games, the more I seem to like 'em. Concordia is a clear evolution of Navegador: the way the scoring mechanism works (by having players taking actions and collect the multipliers at the same time), the extra action going round counter-clockwise, the less pronounced but still discernable attempting to do what noone else is doing, ... . It's all there in one form or another. But it doesn't have an obvious rondel. 

Concordia was not on my radar because I suspected it came with deck building, a mechanism I intensely dislike, but as it turned out there is no deck building in sight. You have a growing stack of action cards from which you can freely choose. Okay, the stack grows and 'builds', but the free choice makes it fundamentally different. This is a Good Thing; and frankly, the presence of the Diplomat action which allows copying of the last previously played card of another player puts the icing on the cake as far as this mechanism goes. You definitely don't feel as boxed-in as in the older rondel games here, nor as in other action card with recall-titles. Okay, if I really want to be annoying I can state that the rondel is hidden in the action cards because they are single use only until you reclaim them, but since you add similar actions to your hand you can do a few repeats very easily. So in the end I'm inclined to say that this is a rondel-less game. At bloody long last.

The game itself is not really something to write extensive stories about. You walk around on a map with meeples and ships to erect little houses on cities: doing so gives you access to the resource that particular city produces which you can turn into cash or other resources. In order to erect new houses or gain new shipples [i]and[/i] (very important!) new action cards with the all-important multiplier bonuses you need different resources and [i]sic transit gloria mundi[/i]. There are no difficult patterns to master here, though there is some specialisation in that some will opt for quick movement and thus cheap access to yet unclaimed cities (they less costly to build in then), while others go for putting down all their houses in different provinces, yaddayaddayadda. Player interaction is less than in Navegador: instead of being really able to hurt someone after you in turn order, it's more of setting them up to do something different which is still worthwhile. Concordia has a very friendly feel to it, even at the maximum of 5 players.

What I really dislike about this game though is the fact that keeping track of how well the other players are doing is a muddled mess. In Navegador you can still see what people are after; not so in Concordia because the card decks are kept in a player's hand, thus obscuring the important multiplier information. I would be in favour of having an information table somewhere where everything except the different Minerva cards is tracked. This is not, by the way, a running score, because tracking that is a convoluted mess. But something akin to Navegador is certainly welcome. This allows much more precise blocking and playing, which only adds to the game as a whole in my opinion. It's easy to make such a little board, which has me wondering why it wasn't included with the game to begin with. Perhaps it makes the game too chewy? In any case, this severely detracts from the game's overall pleasant feel, and costs it 1 point, undeservedly. 

Concordia is not a game I need to own, but as I said it has the best papers of arriving in my collection under the right circumstances. It only took Mac 6 or 7 games to finally make a title which begins to agree with my tastes :meeple:. Come on, Mac: next time make a game with unrestricted action choice. It'll be fun!

I ended the rules explanation for Concordia *really* excited to play. And the game was fun... but when it finished I was overall less excited about it, primarily for two reasons:

1. The board felt too big. We had 4 players on the 2-4 player side, and it felt like there was *always* room to spread out into uncontested territory. There's certainly reason to be 2nd or even 3rd into a city - leeching goods off of a region that someone else is likely to produce in seems lucrative - but I was expecting/hoping the board would grow uncomfortably crowded by endgame, forcing hard decisions about where to produce, and that simply didn't happen. Three of us still had private or mostly-private fiefdoms, either maintained for the game or built after primary fiefdoms were encroached upon. 

(This may have been in part because one of our four players built very few cities, but we still had as many on the board as you'd expect in a 3-player game.)

2. One player came in a strong 2nd place despite building something like 3 cities, mostly on the strength of having all of his colonists and all three of the Mars cards. On the one hand, it's nice that players can pursue different strategies. On the other hand, I find the strategy of "just build colonists" to be uninteresting - and on first glance, it seems like the Mars cards are something you *cannot* afford to let one player buy all of. I expect this will balance itself out with experienced players, since the Mars cards are apt to be worth a minimum of 6-10 points each (unless there are low-colonist strategies?), but the dynamic irritates me. I'm hoping scores will in general be higher than they were in our game, to help make the Mars cards more of a side dish.

Enjoyed just about everything else about the game: resource/storage management, hand/action management, having money flow through my fingers like water (never quite enough)...

A fun game to play until you get to the scoring. The scoring is simple enough but it may look on the board like you are pretty even but the experienced players will outscore novices by a large margin. The appears to be a single good strategy and once you've worked it out the game is too easy.

Does away with the Rondel and replaces it with a system that I thought as long ago as Antike would serve the same purpose, but way better. Maybe all those other games would be worth playing using this system instead. That said Antike has so many other issues that I suspect it is not salvagable.

Loads of different strategies to win this one, very enjoyable. The hand management aspect works well, as does colonisation. Very solid mechanics. The fact that scoring only happens at the end of the game does make it very difficult for new players to gauge the state of the game, but with experienced players games tend to be quite close and scoring is actually quite fun.

Picked up my copy the end of December! Apparently one of the very few even available in Canada.

Played through three times now. Elegant, simple, yet some neatly tied together mechanics that make the decision-making very deep. Very interesting scoring mechanics that require both strength and breadth to do well in the game. And really lovely artwork and components.

Solid 8 rating, possibly heading for a 9.

Still enjoy this with 2p.  In Concordia, you really are faced with difficult decisions every step of the way, even though the turn structure and overall rules are very simple.  The biggest decisions, we've found, come from producing with the Prefect - which usually involves giving the other player free goods.  But even the path you take through the map, the cards you draft, and the scoring strategies you aim for, intertwine in many different ways and lead to many difficult decisions.

Through these decisions, Concordia offers what we generally look for in a strategy game: you're always faced with the option of going in a different direction, and have quality choices presented to you that can lead to other lines of strategy.  What is impressive is that it does this without a whole lot of variability (compared to, e.g., Brew Crafter's cards, or RFTH) - it all comes from the city tiles, the province bonuses, and, of course, the market row.

There is usually an interesting choice of actions on each turn.  I like the tile flipping for province production.  There is less player interaction than I would like.  Even if you mentally calculated everyone's score every turn in order to pick on the leader, there is often no way to interfere with another player's plans.

A decidedly uninteresting-looking medium-weight Euro with gameplay so smooth it hurts. Accessible, tight, and engaging. Endgame scoring is inspired--tense, surprising, and rewarding for those who play strategically. I really like this game. I respect the hell out of this game. But it's sort of hard to truly love it when it looks the way it does and has the theme it does. Maybe some people get titillated when their provinces produce two cloth? I dunno.

It's fun trying to spread out and produce goods. The card mechanics works great. No real confrontation in the game but it still feels like you are still playing against one another. Make sure when the game is taught, that the cards are explained well for scoring in the end game.

RATING: 7
If you're going to play a bone-dry game about trading in the Mediterranean, you could do a lot worse.

The cardplay is what makes this one special.  Each turn, you can either play a card from you hand to perform an action, or pick up your entire hand from the table and perform no action, which makes hand management critical.  The rest is fairly standard city claiming and resource generation.

Three players is the sweet spot for me.  The map is super tight with four, and five is a drag.

I think Mac Gerdts is becoming one of my favorite designers. There is a subtle softness to his designs that lends them a hard edge you can use against your opponents without there being bad feelings around the table, if that makes any sense. It's like a very strategic but violent nerf fight. It's not the classic give and take of old school German design (like Settlers of Catan) but something much better.

-shrug- Well, anyway!

Right now this game feels like a 7 to me, but I am giving it the benefit of the doubt as Imperial did this to me too- started out a 7, then became a solid 8.

I like the manner in which points are gained and define your strategy in card sets. I also like the use of the map.

The box cover is weird. I admit it. So is Imperial's. This is the Mac way.

Euro through and through. Squeaks in at an 8, but might drop. What saves this game for me is the diplomat card, allowing a player to copy the most recently played card of an opponent. This injects much needed interaction and an element of chicken to the game. "I know he needs to play that card, do I set myself up for the copy or do I do something else -and perhaps prevent myself from optimally copying his uber-card..."

Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game.

Ótimo jogo, pode ser considerado um "gateway" para jogos mais pesados. Uma boa dose de estratégia e tática, especialmente com a contagem máxima de jogadores em cada um dos mapas. Pode frustrar alguns pela falta de interação, mas isso faz dele um jogo amigável, em que o conflito se resume à ordem de ocupação do tabuleiro, de compra das cartas e uso do tribuno.

An economic theme based on the deck building mechanic, with lots of strategic ways to score points. 
The game prodution is neat and the game plays faster than one might think. There is enough interaction between players, as each one is rushing either to claim spots (cities) on the board or to buy improvment cards.
The push your luck mechanics regarding the income in the provinces (flip tiles) is also nice. 
Besides, the timing is a crucial aspect of this game, because attention must be paid regarding the best use of the "copy action" cards and the resources available for each player at any given time, so that they can not take advantages of your own actions... 
Overall, the game is a very pleasent surprise!
Mac Gerdts reach my top with a game where the rondel is not present, who would figure that out, hein?!...

It may not technically be a rondel game, but it sure feels like a rondel game. Probably one of the more interesting games from this designer.

card version of rondel plus hand building and market simulation combined with area control for resources. busy but okay art. short rulebook but lots of text on cards. similar to navagedor. antika getting new edition. dry theme but interesting mechanisms

RATING: 9
Interesting game with an excellent scoring system that completely makes the game as good as it is.  Cards that you use to carry out your actions are also used at the end of the game to determine your score, this allows you to customize the strategy that you are attempting to carry out while playing the game, and that information is completely visible to the other players at the table. Taking cards is where the real interaction in this game lies, the board itself is a little bit more passive than I'd generally like it to be. The game also has a race element to it, and the first player to end the game gets a sizeable bonus to their score.

Minor criticisms, the penalty for building in another's regions, especially for low cost goods, is too minimal and makes the game less cut-throat than it could be.  I also wish there were more varieties of card that could be purchased with the senators, and potentially more than one Minerva card for each type of good, allowing for more extreme specialization.  I'm very interested in the expansion, but I'd also love to see a game use a similar scoring mechanism that is longer and more complex.

[25 April 2016] - 7.5 (2 plays)
The second time through the game was a lot more enjoyable than my first. Made a good run for points but stalled out a little at the end. At 4, the map is very tight and stressful in the beginning as everyone tries to expand into all the regions and get into some good cities.

[12 Feb 2018] - 8 (4 plays)
The rules are simple. Play a card and do what the card says. Details on resolving actions are clearly spelled out on the cards. Yet timing moves, working around opponents and ensuring that you have enough resources to keep moving forward requires a lot of thought. It's only after the 4th play that some of the strategies and optimal moves are starting to become visible. Given we have 6 maps and more that we don't own, I can see this providing a lot of plays in the coming years.

The rulebook features the shortest description of a turn in any game of this level of complexity.

As in Stone Age, you're acquiring cards that have multiplier effects for your actions on the board; the better those cards jive with your actions, the better your score. Dice rolling and worker placement determine your actions in Stone Age; card playing determines your actions in Concordia. I prefer Stone Age, but Concordia is fun, too.

After one play-

The Good: Great gameplay.  Lots of choices, lots of room for different strategies.  The scoring at the end isn't obvious or intuitive, so it's not necessarily obvious who's winning.  This keeps people from giving up when there's an obvious runaway leader.  The ability to copy an opponents card is a really cool mechanism.

The Bad:  Really large and non-standard box size/shape make storage difficult.  The board is so-so, the artwork on the cards and components a little flat.  The different strategies for scoring aren't obvious, so first-timers are at a huge disadvantage.  Lots of choices can be confusing. Not too sure how this will work as a 2-player.

The Verdict:  Jury's still out, but initial thoughts are that it doesn't quite live up to the hype.  Not sure if this is a keeper or not, need more plays to be sure.

Nah, didn't have the time nor space, so I traded it away.

A pleasant but nothing special VP chase with all of the standard Euro mechanics of collect resource, 'build a set of those' using your resources to score X points and collect some cards to add some VP multipliers.

This is a semi-economic engine game that reminds me of Navigador.  You have to get your income up so that you can generate goods and money to allow you to build more factories to generate more goods. All along while buying cards to give you VPs.  VPs are not tallied until the end of the game so it is hard to know how well you are doing.

I like the card mechanic to determine action selection.  It's been done before but still feels fresh.

That said after 1 play I wouldn't say it wow'ed me.  Solid, but nothing spectacular. It might drop a point but don't see it going up.

Mechanics are sound and work well. Fairly simple to catch on. Reminds me of Lewis and Clark with the playing the cards and then bringing them all back into your hand. I did find that the artwork made the game a bit dull. If it was beautiful artwork I think it would make a big difference. The cards looked all the same and since that was the entire game. It was difficult to get excited about what you were doing. Saying all this it is still a very solid game but there are a lot of solid games out there with better theme and looks

Players are .... I'm not sure what players are.  I guess some sort of well to do Roman, doing what Romans did - building a network of contacts across the empire, in a bid to become more powerful.

Players play cards from their hand to take actions - accumulate resources, cash, plant houses, move their pieces by land and sea, and acquire more cards.  They gradually build up a deck of cards by the end of the game that have in built scoring multipliers (bit like the Stone Age cards) for end of game scoring.

Perfectly solid, workmanlike game - but awfully dry, with a weird tempo.  The first two thirds of the game are glacial as you try and build an economic engine with your cards and game board network.  Then suddenly the game leaps away and seems to end very quickly.  Happy to play it again, needs to be explored further.

Repeated plays has convinced me this is an excellent game.  Very clean and easy to teach, but not easy to play well.  It does teach you to be efficient, and not waste a turn.

This is a great game, that plays well at all the counts (2-5) - I don't feel like much, if anything, is lost in the two player game, and with the salsa expansion adds another map to play on, so there are lots of map choices now.
I think that overall the game is quite austere, but I feel that the card 'fake rondel' mechanic makes the game as turns can be 'instantaneous', and without players who get AP the game can zip along, after a the first few quite scripted turns. Also the game is very generous as in you can one way or another get the resources you want, you are also not blocked from cities once someone else builds there so you are never denied anything, it just becomes more expensive for you, bit like life really.
Set up time is medium, and you can easily delegate jobs to speed it up.
It's a weird one to teach however as it's deceptively (or maybe not deceptively) easy to teach, basically you play a card and do what it says - with a few caveats and stuff you might forget. However I would recommend doing intermediate scoring if playing with new people as it is easy to have no idea how you are doing, and to lose based on buying no Minerva cards or Mars cards even though that aside from that you have played well, or excellently.
Conclusion: I think this is a solid and to use an oft overused word - elegant game, though I'd rather play a handful of Euros over it, and though I think the board is gorgeous the box art - smiling woman with grapes in ancient world -  doesn't bring anyone to the yard.

Update: almost a ten, this game is a winner in all my play groups.

Deck building as a kind of Personel Roundel. Very clean design. Scoring can be a bit opaque for new players. Remarkably high scoring game (100+ for new players).
If you check the rest of my collection I don't really have a 'Trading in the Mediterranean' game. This fits the bill and is a pretty strong design in my book. I like to think of the theme as setting up a mechant network rather than colonies - but whatever works.

Solid medium-weight Eurogame that would be near the top of my purchase list if I was still buying Euros hand over fist.   Blends a lot of familiar mechanisms together - role selection, resource engine, network building, and even a little bit of deck building.   Couple of clever things here.   Each card has a scoring condition attached to the bottom, so each and every card in your deck will get you points in some way.  In order to build settlements that produce X, you must first have X to build the settlement.  So, it's an interesting chicken and egg puzzle that requires use of a Mercator or a Prefect to solve.   Engaging game, even with a full 5 players.   Maybe not particularly original, but well blended.  Odd box size and ugly cover art are minor problems, but those aren't too important.

Outstanding game! Concordia gives multiple valid paths to victory, and really comes down to which player best adapts their chosen strategy as moves play out on the board. Game play is easy to learn, and after one game players will be able to take short turns and keep the game moving along well. Graphic design is well done. Game-end conditions make sense. The scoring method is interesting and impacts choices throughout the game. This game brings the whole package (though the box cover art does the game a disservice in my opinion).

A decent resource management/planning game.  I think you really have to get going out of the gate, putting cities on the board so that you can benefit more from production.  Then you've got to expand from there, while simultaneously buying cards, since the game can end pretty quickly.  This sort of balance between cities and the scoring cards which count them is difficult to achieve.
The cards are probably the best part of the game.  It's not a deckbuilder, but it has a little of that feel, since your choices narrow down until you play the card that resets everything back to your hand.  Each new card has an ability, but it also has a scoring criterion.  Hopefully, you're picking up cards whose scoring formulae you're going to try and max out.  
There are the usual problems.  Some of the criteria you can pretty much forget about (money is just an afterthought), others are very tough to do (getting a city in every province), and some are really easy (the Mars cards that just require you to unlock 4 pieces).  I also think the specialist cards are pretty worthless.
It should be a good game despite this.  But for me, it never escapes the feeling of just another boring resource-management exercise.

RATING: 7
If you form a strategy and take a few turns to execute it, it may be foiled or helped by another player in a way that feels accidental to both of you. It's very Euro in that way, but the possibility of being influenced does provide some tension.

Interaction is fairly low, with only a few opportunities for clever plays that would help you while intentionally disadvantaging others. Knowing the cards well can increase these opportunities.

Enjoyment mostly comes from puzzling out the optimal way divide your strategy into efficient turns. There's endgame tension when your last plan is threatened by the possibility of someone triggering the endgame, or if you are in a position to trigger it, whether you should do it or try to earn more points first.

I didn't like this the first few times, because I felt pressure to estimate everyone's hidden-but-trackable scoring formulas and act accordingly. After playing the game half a dozen times, I have more of an internalized feel for who's going after what and what will efficiently increase my score. It takes several games to get there, which I consider a knock.

[b][FirstImpression20thNov2013][/b]Where do I even start. As a Mac Gerdts fan, this feels similar (in a good way; his signature designs are in there), yet different. The 'rondel' is now the cards that you recycle in your hand.

There are five different resources in the game, but I don't know which one to focus on while in the game. Everything seems important but not all are easy to achieve. Cloth/silk is important to buy cards, brick is important for foundation to build building, tools and wheat/food are important to bring in new colonies. Every resources is important but I don't think focusing on all is a good idea. 

Cards that you purchase will shape how you will score at the end of the game, so basically you also want to focus in what your cards will score for you. 

For those who are familiar with Mac Gerdts designs, you will see some similarities to his other designs (note this doesn't mean a bad thing at all). The 'rondel' mechanic is still there, but there are now switched to cards instead of the actual rondel. The 'no points are scored' while the game is in progress is there, so basically only when the game ends we will score for VPs. The ship and person wooden tokens are in similar shape as his previous games.  

I like that he didn't use cubes to represent the materials, so you can recognize the resources right from their shape. 

So far I have to say I like it although I still need more play just to see how much I like it.

[b][SecondPlayOn21stNov2013][/b]Played a 2 player game. I can confirm that it works although the dynamic has now changed. With 2 players, you can focus more in certain areas, but not in multiplayer games.

In our 2 player game, my opponent ended the game by buying the last 2 cards, and with my last and final turn, I built up all my 15 buildings (which is the other end game condition). 

The game ends in about an hour.

Concordia is a Mac Gerdts design, he of Navigador and the rondel. Cornucopia gets rid of the rondel and instead is a fascinating map-based, card-based objective-driven game which works elegantly and with a lot of tension. The rules are few, just 4 pages, and upon reading I was underwhelmed. But when you play the game you realise just how clever and exciting it becomes. 

Points are scored according to a number of common game-end objectives (number of cities you are in, amount of money etc). You all have an identical deck of cards and the cards give particular actions on the map (expand, gain resources, trade etc) but once played you can't do that action again until you choose to effectively forfeit an action and pick up the cards. 

So far so dull...but here's the interesting bit: you can get more cards (thus building a deck) and these same cards also act as points multipliers to the different respective objectives at the end of the game. The conflict is thus: you want to build a diverse deck to give you a good choice of actions, but in order to maximise your scoring multipliers at the end you have to concentrate on one or two of the objectives and therefore you need to concentrate on collecting one or two types of card multipliers. But this gives you a deck with loads of the same action, which is not useful at all. How you balance your actions deck whilst trying to achieve the multipliers for one or two objectives is the key to the game. And the tension comes from the fight for space on the board, for the cards that come up and for money & resources. Tense tense tense. And the beauty is that, unless you are keeping track of every card each person buys you really have no idea who is doing well until the final scoring so there is no sense of playing a losing game. 

Fabulous game, and one of the very best from 2013.

We play mostly 2 players and enjoyed or 2p plays of the base game. Simple rules and game play but there is a ton of depth to the strategy. The game really took off for us though when I picked up the Salsa expansion and we were able to play with the tighter map of Spain. A lot more bumping into each other added some more decisions to the game.

I really like the graphic design on this game, even the box art.  It's nice to see a game that doesn't have an amped up masculine design on the cover.  The map is beautiful and the pieces are excellent.  I like the cards, but the text is a little more than I care for.  I imagine that once I get to know the cards better there will be less reading.   

Come first play, I was really excited to play this.  From the rules, it seemed like a sleek, fast playing euro.  I also have a fond love of games that use cards to drive play, so this game was at the top of my anticipated game list for 2013.  Then I played it.  It's not a fast playing game.  You need to really keep an eye on the scoring possibilities and keep them in the back of your head.  You also need to dig into your hand of cards, figure out what you want to do, and map it out among the available actions.  

This game is a thinker, and you need to wade through all the text on the cards and line it all up in the right order, like a neatly structured essay, in order to get the things you want done.  I don't really know if I had fun playing this game.  There's a lot of thinking, but all the actions are dirt simple.  There's not a lot of meat to chew on here.  Just a lot of text to arrange.  It feels like a skeleton of a game.

On top of that, this game made me look at all my other games and question why I have all these stupid things, and made me not want to play them.  I think it has to do with the bare bones structure of the presentation.  The actions on the cards reflect the general decision making processes that exist in most games.  It was like peeling back the skin and muscle and looking at the bones, and then being unable to see anything but bones when looking at other games.  Maybe I'm just burned out on games.  I dunno.  This game messed me up though and it should probably get a special award for that.

What can I say about Concordia? It is a super dry Euro with a generic trading in the Mediterranean theme and an ugly, uninviting game box. It is also highly strategic with lots of replay value, hidden depth, and low rules overhead. In a word: elegant. You can teach this game in one phrase: play a card, do what it says. 

Simply said, this is a wonderful game that I have yet to get tired of and don't see that happening soon.

2015-07-28 : The game is an engine building smorgasbord, a mixture of various mechanics - role selection, deck building, area control and route building.

All the parts are very well integrated and play is smooth and fast. The layout is good, but not great - some niggly stuff like the little houses obscuring the type of city depending on where you sit around the board. At times I had to literally stand up to get a good view of the board.

That and the point counting / bookkeeping phase at the end of the game - which is a bit of a letdown - reduce the game's score

I think it is a solid game, with really easy rules for teaching.  It seems like it would be good regardless of whether you play from 3 - 5.  Two may even be decent but I would just rather play one of my other two player games.  I find there to be a lot of indirect interaction in this one: taking cards from the display that others want, jockying to end the game for bonus points, trying to build in places before your opponents so they have to pay more to build in the same city, trying to build in regions where your opponents are so when they produce you will get something out of it, and of course paying attention to what others have played so you can diplomat appropriate cards.  I like that the only scoring is done at the end of the game, so it's kind of hard to tell who's winning.  One would think that a game with cards would have great replay value, but there is very little randomness to the cards.  You use the same cards based on the number of players, it's just the order in which they come out in the display that differs (which technically could change things up).  While it's a solid game, I worry that it will feel very samey after 5 - 7 games, so it may not be long for my collection.

Concordia is everything its cracked up to be. While the theme is exhaustively overdone, Concordia twists the Euro game mold is two distinct ways, which lend directly to its popularity. Firstly, player interaction while indirect is not obstructive, and is instead (mostly) beneficial to others. Secondly, and more importantly, players tailor their own end game scoring values. This promotes drastically varied play, and equips players with an incredible amount of control. Once the learning curve is cleared the game moves briskly, and rarely overstays its welcome.

Pros
--Variable setup allows games to feel a lot less samey
--Grows with you with familiarity (I don't think I'll ever get to that point as I generally don't like this game)
--Definitely don't feel funneled to one single path to victory

Cons
--Unintuitive scoring, only offering feedback at the end
--Must jump through hoops (unintuitive economy/trading process) to complete desired actions
--Nearly every action you do gives you points, but at different rates for different reasons.  This is the worst point salad possible.  The least objectionable point salads give immediate feedback.

I've decided I like this best with 2-3 players. At that level, there is enough interaction, both competition and mooching, and the engaging Roman theme and low randomness makes it kind of cozy and enjoyable. With four or five players it starts to feel a bit overly long and not interactive enough, although it's still not bad.   

The "mooch off other people's prefecting" element turned out not to be as significant as I had hoped, making it less interactive that I was hoping with larger player number, which is part of why I prefer it with fewer, where the diplomat usage and the competition for cards is more engaging.

The interesting thing about this game is that it really seems like a mid 90's Euro from the pre-engine building era, yet it's from 2014 and I enjoy having it in my collection for that fact. It's not my favorite Euro, but it's pretty unique. The rules are simple, but the practical strategies are pretty deep. 

One of the appeals of this game for many people is that while it's a competitive game where you're actions can effect other people, there's really not any direct or even indirect conflict (ie, worker blocking). This is not really a concern of mine, and honestly this game does seem a bit tame & friendly. It can seem anti-climactic, rather than ramping up and getting exciting towards the late game.

I have also had trouble with scoring in this game. It should be straight forward, but people always get hung up on it. It makes no sense to have a scoring track for a game that only scores at the end, especially in a game with multiple score categorized with different multiplication values applied to each one. I fully believe that this game should have come with scoring sheets for itemized score recording, rather than a scoring track.

Concordia is a reasonably good euro with a unique handbuilding mechanism that offers a different experience from the usual worker placement. Tension is created via the need to take cards on offer vs get resources vs spend resources to take board spaces before they become much more expensive. Cards you acquire go right into your hand for use immediately, and building your deck of actions is reasonably fun. 

On the downside, the heuristics in this game are tough. The ostensible fun of the game is taking actions that are either engine-building or VP-scoring -- but you don't know how well you're doing because scoring happens at game end. I have a hard time knowing what's a better relative move during the game; and after the game, it's not clear what I should have done. Some of my friends are great at it, however. 

And I'm OK with that as a game to play on occasion, but the shine of the card collecting wore off quick, like 4 plays, and I sold my copy. I'll play on occasion, but the overall experience felt thin awfully soon.

Update: After trying the Salsa expansion, I think they addressed the thinness of the experience by adding in special actions and powers.

One of the easiest games to slip into in recent memory, I'm truly impressed at the smooth gameplay. Despite my unwarranted concerns about the themed setting, it's a delight. 

Basically you are performing actions, hand management, a little deck building, worker placement, resource investment/production/trading...and yes a personalized rondel (your hand of cards, think Runewars). Add to that your hand is actually a recipe for "point salad", and you'll still be surprised at how charming it is.

And yes, there is luck due to randomized locations, bonuses and a shuffled deck...if only he could've figured out how to add dice and combat :)

- trading in the Mediterranean--so original
- the panic to buy up all the remaining cards once the deck runs out

Concordia manages to combine many mechanics into one cohesive and compelling game.  While you're deck/hand building, the game gives you incentive to hold off on shuffling as long as possible.  You must wander the countryside expanding your network, but having the largest network does not guarantee you the win.  You can collect all that money from the territories, but in doing so you provide your opponents resource opportunities.

Incredibly balanced game that only gets better with every game you play.

I usually hate resource management style games with boring themes, but this was actually a lot of fun! I have as of yet only played two-player games, which can feel a little imbalanced sometimes.

Once you wrap your head around the card play and get a good feel of how to move around and balance your resources efficiently you're left with a game that is tight, yet very samey. The cards offered in the market are just multiples of (or slightly better versions of) your starting hand of cards (which is fine). However, it means there isn't a whole lot of extra game here to explore once you understand it.

DOWNGRADE:

There is a scoring problem with this game. It looks like SATURNUS and JUPITER cards are the way to go, with other cards being underpowered, namely VESTA's.

The thing is that SATURNUS and JUPITER cards synergize with other things in the game, whereas e.g. MARS cards don't. Just think how expensive it is to put all your workers on the board. And for what... For only trying to multiply their numbers by the MARS cards you get? Totally not worth it. You DON'T need 6 workers on the board.

To me MERCURIUS and MARS cards should read "3 points for every...".

Mostly pretty boring really - not much replayability, you don't interact that much, it's cookie cutter Trading in the Med with a titchy deck building mechanic pasted on. Losing those multiplier cards to someone else can also cost you the game and you won't always have control over that.

For me this was just a so-so euro.  It's just not that interesting.  Once again, you are trading goods in the Med. with some area control thrown in for good measure.

Okay, so you've got some scoring multiplier that you can increase during your game, which you're going to want to.  So even though you could buy other cards, you probably won't since you want to get 3x, 4x, or 5x rather than a bunch of 2x.

Where is the fun in that.

Better with 3 than with 2, and the Diplomat along with the Bonus doubler make the game.

Navagador meets Stone Age.  The scoring with the card multipliers is very similar to Stone Age.  I have only gotten a chance to play this once but I'm wondering if it is always more beneficial to get as many cards as possible.  I ended with very few houses on the board but more cards than anyone and it was just a blow out.

Ok Euro from the "add complexity to make it stand out" genre. It's got lots of stuff to do, microturn and card drafting and yet it's still a bit "meh".

Interesting parts are the way scoring is determined by the cards you buy during your game. Thus there's a neat balance between expanding positions (income buildings) and drafting cards.

Fairly simple to learn and enjoyed the trade-offs with the action limit. Several turns I felt just 1 action short of pulling off a great move, which is always a sign of a good game.

Nagyon egyben van ez a játék. A rondellásoikat kicsit uncsinak találtam néha, de a kártyás "rondella building" mechanikájával nagyon bejött. Nagyon jó még hogy nincs feleslegesen elnyújtva, így értelmes időn belül le lehet játszani egy partyt. 
Elsőre 8 fölé nem adok, már a 8 is ritka, de érzésem szerint ez még simán mehet feljebb.

Iszonyat jól működik két fővel. Talán a legjobban működő olyan játék, ami eredetileg több fősre tervezett. Antike duellomot simán veri.

Nagyon gondolkodom a 10-esen. Szerintem meglesz.

Concordia reuses the card play from Flandern 1302 and extends it a little so you can add more cards to your hand. Ironically, while this is probably Concordia's most distinguishing feature the scoring that is firmly tied to the acquisition of those cards is also the one feature that feels tacked on and entirely disjointed from the boardplay. In other words, what you do during the game only has a fairly weak connection with what you actually score at the end. The most impressive merchant empire is worth zilch if you didn't buy the right cards in sufficient quantities.

Other than that the game feels very solid yet a little old-fashioned which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Sometimes it is good enough simply not to be objectionable.

CONCORDIA ist ein Spiel, indem sich Kreise so ineinander verschrauben, dass man zunächst nicht weiss, um welchen Kreisel man sich zuerst kümmern soll. Beispiel: man braucht genau diejenige Ressource, mit der man ein Euro-Holzhäuschen in eine Stadt pflanzen kann, die diese Ressource produziert. Ich bekomme die Ressource für den Bau des Euro-Holzhäuschens, wenn ich bereits ein Holzhäuschen in der Stadt gebaut habe, die diese Ressource produziert. Die sprichwörtliche Katze, die sich in den eigenen Schwanz beisst, beschreibt das ganze Spielgefühl von CONCORDIA, indem alles mit allem kreisend verschraubt ist, so dass sich das Rondell von Mac Gerdts, das er in CONCORDIA diesmal durch Karten ersetzt hat, sich im eigenen Kopf dreht und einen anfänglichen Schwurbel verursacht. Drehungen, das man einem komisch wird, ist die Eigenschaft von Karussell, welches ganz schön Spaß machen kann, wenn man sich an die Drehungen gewöhnt hat. Für alle anderen bleibt nur die Ressource Papierkotztüte. Das Schnarchthema Rom mit dem kleinen Latinum ist natürlich boring, wird aber durch die alternativen Spielpläne aufgeweicht.

The game plays quite fast and I enjoy it to plan ahead what cards I want to play in which order to archieve my next goal. 
Compared to Navegador I think the nteraction is a bit less. In navegador I always can make good guesses what each other player will do the next one or two turns because of the restrictions on the rondell and his position on the board. In Concordia it is impossible for me to track the cards of all other players so I cannot know what they will do next although boardposition and ressorces give a good idea what they aim for next.
I can't say which game I enjoy more.

Concordia is a recent discovery for me, but it left quite an impression. The game is one of area-control and deck-building with some opportunities to mitigate a weak deck along the way. Looking back at 2013 I have to retroactively crown Concordia as the best game that I've played from that year -- only Karesansui (a re-theme of Undercut), Quantum, and Potato Man come close to measuring up to this gem.

Excellent euro game.  It uses a very interesting deck mechanism.  Each turn you play a single card of your choice, but also control when you want to recall your used cards back into your deck, but it will cost you a turn.  Timing your moves is tricky and since scoring is based on a combination of board state and the cards in your hand at the end of the game, it creates a fun challenge to consider your end-state strategies while pursuing mid-game objectives.

Concordia is an exciting trading game. I had the chance to try it only once, but I fell in love with its dynamic, with the continuous interaction between players and the difficult predictability of the final score.

It is wonderful fat-free game, in that the simple playing of one card can lead to so much thinking about next move.

I've wanted to try Concordia for awhile. I have yet to meet a Mac Gerdts game that truly blows me away, so I was hoping that this one would be one. In the end, I think I still like Navegador a shade more than Concordia. Some interesting mechanics that worked together quite well: playing a hand of cards as actions, collecting more cards to increase available actions, and using those cards as scoring multipliers at the end of the game. But with 2 hours of play the game ends feeling quite dry and repetitive. Never really felt any tension either. The game was more often than not an exercise in resource and card management. I never really felt like that special "something" was created when naturally dry Euro mechanics come together. There are a great number of Euros that I enjoy and are able to bring some magic. Perhaps I just felt Concordia had no magic. But it certainly was a solid game and it all works. Nothing clunky or weird or overly gamey. Just a little too dry to inspire my want to play it again anytime soon.

I cannot really say what makes me like this game so much, it is not that different from many other production games. The mechanics just fit and the game is just fun. 
+ Buying cards with actions is a nice deck building touch. 
+ Maps with semi random tiles are good.  
+ Easy to understand actions, but with some nice combinations. 
+ Many good things to do, feels like it goes good for everyone. 
+ Production is good with region production that make make it possible to produce up to 4 products, but also produce for other players in area. 
- Theme not that involving, I am producing goods and trying to get the most VP in the end.

Despite appearances, this is not an area control game.  This game is part worker placement and feels a bit like a deck builder (buying cards which go into your hand, give you powers and score VP at game's end).  This game works really well with four people.  It's competitive - I came in second by ONE point - but there are always good moves to take on your turn.  Turns are quick unless you play with AP prone players.  Really look forward to playing this one again and trying out the expansions.

Concordia has a nice peaceful element to it, with indirect confrontation (frustrating other players by beating them to cities and cards). The board, pieces, and cards are nicely crafted & designed and bring one into the theme pretty convincingly. Some say it it dry and it is, but the cardplay keeps you engaged well enough. The only problem, as I see it, is the unused scoring track around the board (unused until the end when scores are added). There's simply no way to know where players are with regard to points (although you can estimate). I suppose once you get used to the game & are familiar with the god-cards scoring mechanism, you can watch for what cards players have & keep track, but until then- a bit frustrating.
All that being said, it's nowhere near as good a game as Imperial or Imperial 2030.

Well produced, likeable game by Mac Gerdts.  Instead of a rondel for action selection, he uses a deck you build here.  The desk has a dual function of scoring and action selection, although the action selection part is not nearly as important as the scoring.  Otherwise, it has his signature balance, quick turns, and varied scoring.  Theme is not as good/strong IMO, but it's a solid title, and nicely produced.

It can be fast, but also very slow. I usually need not more than 1min. Others needed 3-5min for one turn! You have no clue if you're good or bad, till the end. And then surprise, I won. The multipliers are too strong I think.

The god theme is not very present and I'm not feeling like I'm conquering.

It ended with no one producing in regions because there were also others present.

Then we played Concordia on the British side of the Concordia: Britannia & Germania map, 3 players it was tight on this map, the map filled up quickly and I had 8 "houses" left to build when the whole map was full. Great little game, I was worried that it would break down to tedium like Brass but it didn't, there was a lot more strategies and more choices with each card play. Brass was auto stupid tile placement with obvious choices every turn, not so with concordia. What I like most was the nice blend of tactics and strategy with this one. If I had one complaint, its a little too friendly

A card based variant on the roundel mechanism of Gerdts other games - select actions to gather resources to claim cities and provinces and get VP.

Such a brilliant game! The rules are incredibly simple but the decisions every turn are interesting and strategical. It's a mix of small, interesting mechanics that fit together using some of my favourite mechanics, hand management and deck building. There are plenty of paths to success which leads to feeling like every move is good and as the game continues your choices will decrease, which leads to less AP. The diplomat is my favourite card, because it allows you a "free" action if your opponent plays something you already wanted to do. However that may not always be the best move, as the diplomat can allow you to play a rare card, such as senator, twice if you hold on to it. 

I'm not a fan of the theme, but the components are nice and the box size is lovely.

Liked it much better on my second play with three than my first play with two. 

Three players might be the sweet spot but I'd be up for trying a four-player game. 

PROS/NOTES
-A dynamic push and pull between when to work on your engine and when to take points.
-A surprising amount of planning in the resource management. 
-A big push to get many different things done in a short amount of time. I was often having to take several turns to set up for one action. 
- All this led to some turns being quite quick where others were more AP prone. Part of this is due to the fact that it's hard to plan for your next turn as the board can change drastically and you might need to make a plan B on the fly. The main reason why this might work better at three.

CONS
-It's quite hard to have a strategy for choosing cards. It just seems like you end up taking whatever cards you can afford and hoping for the best. And this leads me to the fact that...
-My biggest complaint is I don't like the endgame scoring but I don't see a reasonable way around it considering the cards are multipliers.

Picked up at a good price and looks an interesting game of hand management/like the theme and period - hope it isn't too AP prone and not sure how it will work with 2? Time will tell.
Edit after playing a game with Sam - both really enjoyed it and ap wasn't much of an issue (it was our first game) and be good to see how the game improves in time as we get better at it.

I love how interactive Concordia is, both in the positive sense (giving players other things when you use your prefect card) and in the conflict sense (buying cards and hindering their progress by moving colonists and building in cities). This might be my favorite modern Euro in the classic mold.

Fantastic Euro that is very easy to learn, plays smoothly, and has little downtime due to shared resource-production. A bit of a point-salad can lead to anti-climactic endings, but overall a very enjoyable experience with enough depth to keep coming back to.

Just your general, every day, set collection, area control, hand and resource management game. Despite the hodge podge of mechanics, I LOVED it. It's going to go into my top 10 after one play. Yes, the theme is non-existent, but the board is vibrant and colorful and the game provides such wonderful tension. You never feel like you are making the optimal move, even when you are. You never feel like you are doing all you want to do, even if you are accomplishing more than your opponents. I don't love that all the scoring occurs in the end game giving you no idea where you stand along the way, but that is a minor quibble. This game is awesome.

Played once with 4 players. Smooth, tidy design with no immediately apparent imbalances. At 2 hours it is a 7 out of 10 for me. If with experience we are finishing in under 90 mins it could easily rise to an 8 or 9. March 2014

*UPDATE* 5th game and it's not getting quicker. Much as I admire the solid design I guess the lack of variety will hamper it getting played above many similar length games. August 2014

*UPDATE* 10th playing and I don't have a problem any longer with the 2 hours a 5 player game takes. I have not found anyone who dislikes it. Love it with 3, 4 and 5 players. Rating up from a 7 to a 9. May 2015

[b]Concordia is one of my favourite game from my collection, the 1st game I rated 10. This game reeks elegance.[/b]

I first read about Concordia on a Geeklist and that time I was quite knew to the BG land. Was in an impulsive buying spree. Then I saw this [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9u6IuoIPUA]review by Shut Up & Sit Down[/url] and was sold then and there. I wanted this game and it was out of print. Searched for it a lot and it was really expensive to get. The shops in Tokyo were teasing me with the Japanese edition of Concordia and then finally got my hands on it later when it appeared in UK stores.

[b]Reasons I own it:[/b]
Concordia is a one of the first few games where I actually started researching gameplay before buying, unlike few games that I got just based on review alone.


- Primary reason would be Quinns review on Concordia got me intrigued
- The rulebook, damn - that’s freaking awesome
- Highly respected game on BGG (doesn’t mean I should like it, but again interest piqued)
- Simplicity and the depth of the game
- I love the puzzle it offers with the cards
- My first hand-management game
- The scalability of the game with player count
- An excellent 2 player game

[b]Components and presentation:[/b]

This is one aspect of the game I was tad bit disappointed with. No, not the artwork but the components for a $60 game is quite sub-par in my honest opinion. Yes, I know I am paying for the [b]design of the game[/b] but, [i]Hey![/i] As a consumer it’s my right to complain.
However, To be fair it is not as nearly lazily produced like Terraforming Mars ([i]yes, I just said that - TM has one of the worse production to price ratio[/i]) and I really like Concordia’s thick board. 
Concordia, a card game, then why not have a bit higher quality cards. Okay maybe it gets too expensive to produce but there are other games giving linen-finish card for lesser price range.

The wooden tokens/meeples are like any euro, with cheap paint applied on it where you can start seeing through the paint. Probably the only two exceptions for quality meeples even from the paint’s standpoint ([i]at least in my collection[/i]) are [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/23202/stonemaier-games]Stonemaier Game’s[/url] meeples and [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/10663/quined-games]Quined Game’s meeples.[/url]. Other than that, the cardboard pieces are quite thick and sturdy.

Now, the artwork; Well this is so subjective, even more so than a review of a game. Concordia’s artwork isn’t for everyone. I like the board’s artwork, the graphic style of the cards and tiles too. Okay, I will be honest it grew on me. First time when I saw it, it had the look of a burned dry bread, I thought it’s a bland, uninteresting looking board. But like I mentioned, the more I played, the more I started liking the artwork; Why though? Because it’s consistent, that’s why. Unlike Terraforming Mars, where half is drawn and the other half is google or stock images with ugly graphics overlay Concordia is extremely consistent in its presentation. 
The board has this quirky details if you care to study is closely, the sea region is detailed with [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3958775/govindk?size=original]weird creatures and ships[/url] and there is even a [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3958776/govindk]creepy looking mermaid[/url] staring back at you. The [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3958777/govindk]Pantheon icons[/url] which has represents the city, with the letters for good tiles on top, also has a tiny letter and the name “CONCORDIA” inscribed on it’s pediment.
The whole board is like a painting on a marble tile if you look at the texture of the board carefully. So all the mural style art was intentional, it wasn’t a lazy design decision by the artist as I initially inferred.

Absolutely amazing game! So easy to explain. Play a card, do what it says. Sure, each card needs a brief explanation on how to use it, but it takes all of 10 minutes to do it. For a medium-weight euro, you can't have more fun than Concordia.

The more I play, the more I love this game. My absolute favorite game!

Given this a tentative 8 after one play.

Looks very nice, plays very nicely and by the end of the game, we were getting it (if not the scoring). The scoring seems somewhat obtuse - it will probably take a few plays before we really get it. As long as you don't agonise over moves, it's a fun Euro. I wouldn't like to play this too heavily, though - potentially brain melting.

One of my top 10 games.  Although Tom Vasel frequently denounces trading in the Mediterranean as one of the worst and most overused themes, this game shines brightly in large part because of it.  It features a rather unique card action mechanism and a challenge of trying to get the most out of each and every one of your cards.

Good game, very quick to get into the swing and played very smoothly.

Solid design and familiar mechanics, but too dry and slow. Get some resources, get some money on the following turn, some more resources next, then actually do something, if you don't have to recover your cards before. And I'm not fond of the scoring system, where basically every progress you make gives you points at the end of the game, but how much you gain also depends on what action cards you buy. It's a bit like the multiplier cards in "Stone Age", but more complex and harder to assess.

Everything points to me loving this game but I don't.  

I guess I dislike that I can't meaningfully track game state and understand how each player is doing.  Am I winning or losing badly?  Do I need to block the red player or the green?  

Luck of the draw with cards and the opening blocking based on turn order is kind of a PITA.  Maybe it's better with 3, but my plays seem to be with 4 or 5.

Un juego bien construido y diseñado, lo que se conoce como un euro de toda la vida, la innovación está en la construcción del mazo, pero para mi es un juego que pese a que su desarrollo es bastante correcto tiene unas cuantas pegas, la primera es que el juego es lo que se conoce como una ensalada de puntos, al final puntúas por todo y nadie sabe como va en la partida hasta el final, se produce un efecto 7 wonders que a mi no me suele gustar. y segundo el juego carece de tensión, todo se desarrolla de forma plana y tus elecciones de cartas derivan en escoger las que mas puntos te puedan otorgar al final del juego sin tener muy en cuenta las acciones que te proporcionan.

Mi sensación final fue la de que es otro euro mas.

This is an economic/trading game but is way more intense and strategic than typical games in this genre.  Every turn involves serious thinking and strategizing and you really care whether you win or not.  Very little to no luck and a bit of a long game, but very well designed.  Probably my favorite long game.

Eurogame que al principio cuando te describen las reglas piensas "ah, pero que facil, esto lo hago yo con la gorra", y luego cuando vas jugando piensas "vale, quiero hacer esto, pero antes tengo que hacer esto, y para hacer eso tengo que hacer esto otro y aaaaahhhgggg me va a estallar la cabezaaa"

tiene la longitud justa, que es "no mucho" porque los triggers de final de partida llegan relativamente pronto. 

"facil de entender, dificil de dominar". buenos materiales. quiza la caja es demasiado grande para el contenido, pero en general, es un muy buen juego.

Of the three 2014 KennerSpiel nominees for 2014, which include Istanbul and Rococco, this is the one that I think I'll get to the table the most often. I've enjoyed all of them equally and feel that in terms of their complexity, levels of interaction and conflict they are close. However I believe Concordia is the one which lighter gamers will enjoys the most. It's theme and central map board and mechanics resonate easily with more familiar traditional games such risk or Settlers of Catan. The turns are quick; the game is generous with resources and players can never completely block one another. Truly frustrating turns are rare and players always feel that they are making some progress even if they are not necessarily winning. In short this game does not feel like 'mean' game and would be a strong non-conflicting couples game. 
The endgame scoring takes a bit to grasp which is both good and bad. It keeps the game tense and players involved as you are never completely sure who's in the lead. However novice players should have the importance of the gaining more personality cards highlighted. Not Only do these cards progress their in-game strategy but  critically they increase their endgame score. My opponent for my first game dominated more areas of the board and had better resources generated but failed to claim victory as I had simply more personality cards to score with at the end of the game.

UPDATE: Istanbul with all the expansions (Grand Bazaar variant) might be the slightly better game but has a bit higher bar to entry.

Molt eurogame, mezcla diferents mecàniques (construcció de rutes, set collection, gestió de mà) amb un mecànisme de deckbuiding similar al del Lewis & Clark. Té un sistema de puntuació final per bonus de cartes (en funció de les cartes que hagis comprat, multipliques un cert tipus de recursos per un factor) que em sembla massa exponencial. Tema sec i poca interacció. Em sembla poc interesant, no aporta res nou...

This is my favourite kind of Euro: a relatively small ruleset belying the depth of the game. This is a heavy game, but it's heavy because you've got to think a lot while you play, not while you try to figure the rules out. Theme-wise it's not the greatest achievement (but it's not as dry as, says, Hansa: the theme does not seems to be a complete afterthought and the gameplay does not feel completely disconnected from it). However, the gameplay is very engrossing and being able to explain it easily to newcomers is always a welcome quality. Do not expect to be able to win against experienced players on your first play though.
I can't wait to try the expansion.

While I haven't played too many of Gerdts' games, I was still surprised to see that there was no rondel in Concordia! In my opinion, this is done in good form as well - the game uses a hand of cards which limits what actions you use. Interestingly, you only begin with 1-2 cards for each type of action (there's only 6), and you must spend a turn to recoup all of them. As an interesting twist, the recouping incentivizes you to have played most of your hand in order to collect money in the process (i.e., for each card recouped above 3, claim a coin). This alone encourages more balanced and interactive game rather than hyper-specialized play (i.e., the kind where everyone picks a path to victory and hope no one else picked the same strategic path). As the game progresses, players also differentiate slightly their abilities (e.g., having an additional merchant action) which leads to some differentiation, but it's more minor than major as every player has a card in their hand that allows them to copy one ability (which becomes increasingly useful to copy a slightly superior version of an action; e.g., merchant gives you 5 additional coins to work with rather than 3). Furthermore, these cards also slightly modify your endgame scoring conditions (e.g., you get two points per dude on the map, however, you multiply this by the number of cards of that type you have in your hand). The rest of the game is typical Gerdts stuff, travel+occupy, produce, buy/sell on a map of the Mediterranean. Like with other Gerdts games, the action moves at a fair pace, everything is broken down into parts such that you have some idea of what is coming from other players (and potentially have a chance to respond in kind, unless you too have to mount a response that simply won't come soon enough). While it is possible to keep track of the score throughout the game, I'm quite alright with the big reveal at the end rather than the incremental scoring throughout (e.g., like Tigris & Euphrates) as scoring does take a bit of time and to have to keep track of micro-changes throughout might slow the pace down quite a bit. Overall, a well produced game with gamey moments throughout.

Some really clever little mechanisms scattered throughout, but overall it's a pretty standard worker placement-style euro.  Certainly not a new Imperial.

Initial rating after one play. Lots of mechanics done very well but all put together it just gave me AP like no other for no payoff. Playing well is very difficult and very mathy. I wish the game was more interactive. I think it would be a better game if points were public As then you could at least more easily calculate how much you're helping others or have a gang up on the leader effect. As-is the game is mostly very dry MPS and unfortunately a hot mess. Make a variant where multiplier drafts are always public and I think you'd have a better game

Dear Boardgeekgamer :)
Sorry - my english is really not so good! I hope, you can understand me?
 
I'm from Hamburg, the city from which also comes the "dynamic Duo" Mac Gerdts & Peter Doersam (PD Verlag)
 
So I have played "Concordia" as a prototype in the last two Years in Hamburg many times.
Par example on the "Hamburger Spieletage" Convention last May round about three times :)
This is a very very nice Game, for me really a "buy" and "must have!
 
The game still works great, with very finely tuned mechanisms 
Fans from "Mac-Games" will loved it, i think.
 
Greetings from Hamburg!

Beautiful components, great gameplay - really enjoying this game. Simple, yet full of depth. Each turn, just play one card out of your hand and do what the card says. However, the choices become much more difficult when you realize just how much it matters which card you play and when. My only negative is that the game is very dry, as many of the reviews say. The gameplay and map make up for it, though, in my opinion.

First time I played it I was not into it.  But the 2nd play was much better, realized a couple little rules we had wrong that helped.  The Italy map is pretty good for 2 players but if we continue to play we will want Salsa or one of the maps for a tighter game.  

Strategic game with a simple rules set.  Set up time is roughly on par with Marco Polo, longer than Viticulture.

RATING: 9.5
The first few turns are pretty scripted in this game (player 1 will build and everyone else will copy or play their build card). However, everyone will most likely have built in separate places due to how the cost of building in a shared city multiplies.

I love the blend of using cards as actions and as end-game point multipliers. Kind of a given, but you will lose if you do not buy more cards over the course of the game. There is a bit of an internal tug of war--do you go for a particular card first or do you build in that cloth city before someone else does and causes the price to double?

Oh and there are several maps and they are all good! The main distinction is some maps are "best" for lower player counts or visa versa. The easiest way to tell is look at how many provinces are on that map (via the bonus good section).

A bit intimidating at first sight, but actually reasonably straight forward.  More choice of actions than Navegador but similar scoring system.  The multipliers are on cards that have other actions.  After one play it seems that most the cards to buy are more use as multipliers than extra actions.

RATING: 7
Yet another rondel game, except this time the 'rondel' takes the form of a personal card deck that you can play in any order. It's very much the formula as before: move, build, gather resources, multiplier scoring. Personally I can take or leave this endless recycling of the same ideas, I don't think a Mac Gerdts game will ever be a buy for me.

RATING: 8
Navegador's cousin.  It's a little more convoluted because a lot of the information about what you are scoring and what you can do is on cards and is different for each player; I suspect it is much more difficult to see ahead a few turns. Whether that's good or bad is up to you, of course. The way the map works is much more multifaceted and gives players lots of ways to get around; I also liked the harvest mechanism. This is one of three (!) games this year to use the no-shuffle deckbuilding mechanic, something I hadn't seen before.  I don't know what my opinion of this will be in the long run, but I'm definitely interested in playing it more. (1 play)

First few turns are a little stale, but I could be missing something. The rest of the game seems fantastic. I love the choices to make and path blocking. It's a hindrance but never feels like worker placement blocking, which I don't enjoy.

Suggest: Reviving

The graphic design is so terrible. Some action card and scoring are annoying to execute, and also it's very hard to visualize the state on board.

The game system is certainly good. Just not sure how intriguing it will be after more plays.

At the core is a management system -- forcing players to play a set of cards cyclically(not until play most of the cards in the set, cannot play the same card again.) The rest is basically standard Euro without too much twist( gather/consume resources, build on network).

If you haven't tried Concordia yet, please put it at the top of your games to play list.  I am trying to help you.  The game is awesome.  This is a wonderful economic Euro game with brilliant game play mechanisms combined in a superlative composition.  There is no luck or randomness in Concordia.  There is no direct confrontation or "take that" in the game as well.  Players are tasked with managing resources and establishing colonies across the map in order to maximize their final score.  Players must be mindful when adding to their deck of action cards because the cards also each have a particular scoring property that rewards one of six different categories: number of different resources produced or total non-brick colonies or number of different provinces occupied, and so on.  I love the map and the components and the game length and the flow of the game.  This is a strong contender for the perfect game and it's every bit as good or better than any game I have ever played.  The level of player interaction is quite good too.  There is no attacking or destroying other players' stuff, but there is a very serious competition mainly for new cards, but also for unoccupied colonies.  I can't say enough good things about Concordia and I can't think of anything I don't like about the game.

RATING: 8
Super area domination game where you can share other people's developments and ride off their efforts.  Sliding card purchases (like Lewis & Clark) is really nicely balanced providing very important individualized scoring paths & strategies (what makes this game so good).  Little bit of a long game and initially a steep learning curve.  Can be very hard to figure out who is winning as the points are calculated at the end of the game and based on collected cards from during the game (the senator action is vital to getting these cards and cannot be ignored).

July 2015:

Felt like a better one of MacGerts games.  I've just decided however, that other than Imperial, they just don't do enough for me.  The beginning of this one felt as scripted as Antike, and there just didn't seem to be enough to make each game feel different.

Still, I liked it better than most of his games.  He always draws me in to try each once.

A little boring theme when the mediterrian area trading and producing goods is a pasted theme for so long. Victory point system is a bit messy and beyond for rewarding the player who deserved winning. Still has wonderful mechanics such as hand building and complexity. Concordia is a solid euro game but looked little overrated to me.

Concordia reflects Roman Empires. Especially, the game is focused on Roman commercial network. Players try to optimize their actions with their character cards. It is very important how properly use the action cards. Playing character action card is more than a halfway importance of the game. This is the most noticeable advantage of Concordia. With the simple rules, Concordia can be appealed to light or new boardgamers too. In fact, I could definitely say that this game is not an easy game. The rule is easy, but the tactical choices are hard and tough. Of course, I have few doubts about the game. I am not sure whether the theme of the game is smoothly working or not. In addition, I don't think the game provides enough fun compare with Imperial or Antike. Perhaps, with simple rules, I wonder the game is lack of absorptive power to gamers. Especially compared with Mac Gerdts' former Rondel games, Concordia is not enought to captivate gamers attention. I guess Rondel is still a nice mechanic to be appealed to many boardgame lovers. In fact, Mac Gerdts' strenghs were fully stood out from Rondel games. I am not setting any limits to Gerdts magnetism. I totally agree Concordia is a nice game. Though, at the same time, I need to say Concordia is still no match for Mac Gerdts' former masterpieces. As time goes by, Concordia is going to be evaluated by boardgames. Therefore, my raitng is also can be changed after more plays.

I dubbed this "Bottleneck the game" after the first turn or two and I think it really fits (in a good way). While the Rondel is completely gone (I don't find the cards similar at all since the penalties/movement restrictions are not there) you do have the same sort of angst here that is present in most (all?) his games where you can see exactly what you want to do, but it will take many many turns to get it done. 

To navigate the bottleneck planning is everything so it's a very strategic game, the game is card driven with your hand of cards (each player starts with exactly the same hand) where each one represents an action so you can plan many many moves ahead here. There are a couple of interesting wrinkles on top of this; you get to add cards to your hand (a little deck building) which not only give you those actions for the future but also it's one of the main ways to score as the cards are multipliers (also similar to some of his other games). This really can create tough choices, because there are some cards you want for their actions yet they may not be the ones you want for scoring. I've said it before and will again, pure deckbuilding bores me to tears, but as just one element in a game it can be really good, and that is the case here. 

Tactics come in via the interaction with the other players in the 2 "market" areas where you can buy cards and where you can pick up resources, and then also in the route-building on the board as areas become more expensive if others get there first (thankfully you are never shut out). The interaction ensures you do need to remain a little flexible in your plans and it can also get you caught up in the tactical grab game, and between that and the bottleneck navigation you can lose sight of the main focus which is maxing out your scoring via collecting cards for their multiplying effect (not just the action) and building on the board accordingly. 

There is very little luck in the game and its another solid offering from Mac. At first I wondered about giving the person who ended the game 7VP, it sounded like a bit of a random bonus but after playing I'm not so sure, it still seems kinda high though maybe 4 or 5 would have been better but its probably fine. I see map is double sided great to see this, and it makes 3 and 4 players both play very good (5 should be fine too just not optimal more PIC, 2 definitely lacking but playable)

My favourite Mac Gerdts game. The game is very easy to teach since all actions are fully described on the cards. The entire game basically resolves around collecting/trading resources and converting those resources into cities or colonists. The brilliance here is that each action weighs differently for each player since the cards that the players own give different amounts of VPs for the board state at the end of the game.

It feels a lot like a bunch of incremental improvements to Navegador. I like Navegador a lot, and I like most of the improvements, but it just feels like there's not enough competition with other players.

Also, having the scoring be completely obscured, as opposed to the easily-seen privileges in Navegador, is deeply frustrating to me. Would play if suggested and if Navegador wasn't around, but not thrilled, and wouldn't suggest.

After a second play, my problem with Concordia (versus Navegador) is that there's not enough tension. Everything scores points, a la Feldian point-salad, and there's no real blocking. Meh.

6/11/2016. Geleend van de Bokkensprong. Strategisch spel in het Romeinse rijk. In je beurt speel je een van je personenkaarten (tribuun, architect, prefect,...), die je telkens specifieke acties toelaten (alle gespeelde kaarten terugnemen, kolonisten verplaatsen en nieuwe steden bouwen, provincies kiezen die produceren,...). Persoonskaarten hebben ook een god; elke god levert op een bepaalde manier punten op (vb. per aantal kolonisten, per aantal steden in verschillende provincies, evenveel als de waarde van de goederen in het pakhuis, etc.). Tof spel; wel een wirwar aan manieren om punten te sprokkelen; moeilijk te voorspellen wie aan het winnen is. Eerste keer duurde zeer lang (over twee avonden gespreid)

RATING: 8.5
Really simple but also really serious game. Every turn you just take one action by playing a card in your hand. You really need to be able to position your cities well so that you can get as much free production from your opponents as possible while not having to give them much. It very vaguely reminds me of another excellent game, Brass, in that regard. To that end the cards that let you produce on all of your cities of a certain resource seem very powerful, since they don't give your opponent anything. Also, it's a game with an interesting timing. Like in Navegador (another Mac Gerts game) the way the game ends means there will be a somewhat leisurely midgame, and then all of a sudden as people start seeing the end in sight they'll start rushing toward it. The scoring is also really cool and makes some of the main decisions of the game more multidimensional. You can supplement your hand with more cards, and the cards have both an action on them and a scoring multiplier. Sometimes the multiplier is slightly at odds with the action and so when choosing cards you have to take both into account and plan accordingly. There is a lot inside this game, definitely my favorite of the KdJ 2014 lot, and I think a perfect fit for the sort of light-medium next level euro that that award is about.

It's an intriguing game.  You start with a hand of cards that each allow you to make a specific action and once played you can't use it again until you play the Tribune card that allows you to pick up your hand again.  Your settlers race out from the starting city establishing trading houses that will earn you goods that you can then sell for money or use to build more houses, settlers, and improved cards.  Crucially, the cards that you have bought provide your victory points at the end of the game and so you tailor your board strategy to the cards that you are buying.  The rules are pretty light but there is a lot of depth of strategy and there is not a clearly right decision to make each turn so you really have to weigh your options.  To mix things up, there are different boards you can get and the Salt expansion provides some additional flavor with Forum tiles that provide different abilities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Concordia is an extremely satisfying mix of deck building, area control, and engine building. The start of the game does feel a bit samey each time - players should race to claim cities and prefect to build initial resources - but the game quickly diversifies as players decide which of the point-scoring strategies will be the winner. The gameplay is extremely streamlined without sacrificing strategic (and tactical) depth. I recommend it for seasoned gamers and those looking for the next step beyond gateway games.

With Salsa expansion.

Not a big eurogame fan, but this is a really good one. Strikes a perfect balance between game length and strategic depth. This makes it interesting for a wide range of players, so it gets a lot of play over here.

2P is fine with the expansion, but a bit dull with just the base game. Still, 3-4 players I find most enjoyable.

As others have noted, theme is dry, but par for the course as for euros. Still, I like the components quite a bit, and the maps look really nice.

Generally I'm a bigger fan of games with more interaction, but when I'm with a more euro-minded group, Concordia is my first pick. Also a great choice for balancing out a more conflict-heavy game.

I've heard the word "elegant" thrown around a lot in game reviews. It usually kind of makes me want to roll my eyes. Then I played Concordia.  I get it now.  This game is just about as close to perfect game design as I could imagine.  The simplicity in simply playing a card each turn is wonderfully deceptive, as this gameplay is actually nice and deep, but hiding under the guise of a light deck-building mechanic.  I LOVE this, and can't wait to try out some of the other maps soon.

A nice tight expansion game. Not a lot of mechanisms. Just expand, build cities, and then the cities produce goods. All of it driven by a card mechanic.

You have a hand of cards that stack up in front of you as you play them, including one card that returns all those previously-played cards to your hand.  You can acquire more cards so you can perform some actions more often before replenishing or so you can perform new types of actions.  On the board, you're moving workers around to build buildings which produce resources.  At the end of the game, each card scores points by category, mostly based on what you built and where.  All of it fits together pretty well, so if it sounds like something you might like, you probably will.  Update: If I played more, I could probably figure out what would make an effective strategy.  As it is, I kind of just flail around for a while and then the game ends. Update2: I had kind of decided to stop playing this, then I accidentally agreed to play it again (as an unnamed heavy euro that I didn't recognize right away). I'm still zigging when I should be zagging and realizing the right move too late.

another Mac Gerts game with no rondel's!  yea yea some have said your personal card deck acts a rondel but I don't think so as a real rondel mostly forces the order of your actions where here you can play your action cards in any order.

In any case was still an enjoyable first play and you need to purchase cards whenever possible, even if they aren't the ones most valuable, a multiplier is a multiplier.

Really like this game, especially because you focus on what is good for you not "what is best for me and worst for my opponent", at least I wouldn't buy cards just to keep one from one of my opponents in this game.

Loads of replayability. Easy to learn. Difficult to win. Lots of options on your turn. Weak players may make the game easier. 

In some ways, it begins to feel like Peurto Rico as the game progresses where you want to play cards that affect you more and your opponents less. The citizen cards available in the lineup help you catch up if you use them judiciously.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2014)

What a pleasant surprise. I heavily dislike Mac Gerdts´ Antike and Imperial series so I wasn’t too keen on playing Concordia. Mercifully it doesn’t have the Gerdts´ characteristic rondel and that’s why it is a good game :P. I only bought it because it was on a sale and now I’m glad I did, for now it is a keeper in my game collection.

Concordia is a medium weight euro game with very interesting/hard decisions each turn (basically which card to play, but each card has far reaching consequences). You want to do many things at once, but you have to choose carefully the few actions you will actually do, lots of good tension. I like it a lot. The end game scoring is great as you chose your path with the cards you bought.

Concordia also have a high replayability factor due to the dual map, the modular city tiles and the bonus goods in each region. Each game will be different. The playtime is around 2 hours but you don’t feel it, also the endgame can arrive very suddenly. 

It has lots of rules, but they are easy to grasp. I feel the game plays best with 4 fast players, with 5 the downtime can be an issue.

The game components are GREAT (excellent wooden bits) and the art is good enough, the game board is very big (which make storage very hard) and it looks gorgeous on the table.

On the bad side, I don’t like the Concordia card, it gives 7 VPs to the player who finish the game I feel it is a bit unbalanced, but I’m not completely sure yet. I have to play more to see if this is an issue for me. The theme is paper thin for me, I still haven’t read the Concordia history book they included in the game but I didn’t felt I was playing on ancient Rome. The middle scoring was a hassle to do, I felt it interrupted the game flow. All the players wanted to continue, but counting the VPs can be slow. I get that it is important for new players to see how the scoring works, but I don’t think I will play with it again.
 
Bottom line, Concordia is a good euro game. It doesn’t really offer anything new, but I like what it offers and how all the pieces work together. Will play again gladly.

I continue to like Concordia, now it is a solid 7.0 for me with a high probability of improving. In general I dislike variable market offerings (like in Ascension and Lewis & Clarke) but this game´s market is very well done. It doesn’t bother me because: 1. There are (for most personalities) many repeat cards in function and to what god it prays so getting what I want for my strategy is very likely if I plan for it. 2. There are diplomats that allow me to copy a powerful effect made by another player in case I wasn’t able to buy the card. 3. The cost system is very well done, buying the newest cards is indeed VERY expensive (unlike L&C) so the luck of the deck is minimized. However the Minerva cards can be very powerful in effect and VPs and they are only one of each in the deck. I need to play more to see if this is an issue for me.

Concordia continues to hold my attention with very interesting decisions, it is hard to know the best card to play. I really like it.

After more plays, the Concordia card still bothers me. It decided the winner in our last game and it can be hard to plan to get it, so I feel it is mostly luck if a player gets it or not. Building the fifteen houses can be controlled, but being the last player to buy a card is hard because it depends on other players. I think it would be better if this card doesn’t exist and all the players had the same amount of turns.

Solid title using a similar multiplicative scoring mechanic to Navegador's.  The cards have certain interesting powers; I would like to have seen even more to emphasize the slow deckbuilding aspect of the game.  I also like how the action selection allows players to engineer themselves out of phase with opponents.

The scoring will probably start to bore me after about 3-5 plays but the game was very enjoyable for a single play.

2-5 players. Card drafting/hand management game in which players are building cities across Rome that will produce different types of goods. These goods allow you to build new cities -expanding your production capabilities- and draft cards, which give you more options for actions each turn and are important for end-game scoring.

Just an excellently designed game with great pacing and elegant mechanisms.  Plays well with experienced gamers and is fairly heavy, but simple enough that new gamers can grok the rules and the gameplay quickly.  For example, my wife who is not a gamer at all caught on very well on her first play and was trading cloth and building towns right out the gate.  Extreme depth here.

Recently learned this game with my wife...And we love this game. Every game we have played has played differently. It is easy to learn but what a fun game. You can see the game progress and the end nearing. The tactics are clearly a balance between picking up cards and expanding your empire. The last game we played came down the the wire and we were both buzzing over it. We just want to play this game again as soon as we finish it!! 
I have played this with two and four player and I must say the more the merrier. 
This is my favorite game right now!!! After every games comes the end of game cameo... the scoring. I like to do each card in order and always start with the player in last spot.... it is so exciting seeing big leads open up only to have them dissappear with the next set of cards...everyone who has played this game wants to play it again right away. My mum even sat down to play this one and enjoyed it, picking it up right away... I mean it's so simple...play one card and do what it's says....And yet I have seen so many vast strategys in the few games I've played!!! Can't go wrong with this game!!!!

I enjoy this and I think it is a good game. It is challenging piecing together what you need. Sometimes it is challenging figuring out what you need. I think it takes a few plays to grok the connections between your choices and how the scoring ends up. 

The key aspect of this game is that you draft cards to use as actions. Not exactly deck-building, more like hand-building. However, each action card also scores for you in one of six ways at the end of the game - so not only are you picking up actions, you are defining what you will score points for. Understanding the relationship between these when you draft your cards is the biggest challenge here and it is a good one. Mac Gerts has shown that he can successfully move away from the rondel that he made his name on!

Rating based on about a half dozen plays.  Enjoyed the game quite a bit when I played it more often right after it first came out, but these days I find some of the newer releases to be more interesting and innovative.  The main mechanic of playing a bunch of cards to the table, then retrieving them, was previously seen in Kreta, this adds the deck-building dimension but makes for a bit more complex but slightly less interesting and innovative game, IMHO.

RATING: 10
Concordia remains one of my favorite games after many plays. Its blend of sophisticated mechanisms makes for an experience that is at once absorbing, challenging and fun. It is surprisingly easy to teach and can serve as an excellent introduction to the heavier end of euro stuff. The scoring system is a bit opaque initially- likely to be the most significant challenge for neophyte players- but after one play it clarifies. Concordia is beautifully produced and its many expansions have kept to that standard.

played once with 2 and another half-play with 3. 

A very well-designed and well-crafted game.  Wish the theme was more present and perhaps different that the whole "trading in the Mediterranean" trope.  

The "hand-building" mechanic, which is close to deck-building, but slightly different, is great.  I like the scoring system, too, but many people seem to have issues with it, both in understanding and for how it works.  

With that said, it is certainly a solid game, and is on the cusp of being included in the collection or not.  One more play through should decide.  So far, I enjoy it, but not sure if I enjoy it enough to have it remain an ever present option.

Definitely 'light strategy' buts that's not bad in this case, and its more strategy than tactics and that's what I like.  Question mark over replay-ability - not sure yet.

No new mechanics here. I found the game rather dry and uneventful because there is no scoring until the end. There is virtually no player interaction leaving me feeling cold. I like the Ancient Roman Empire theme but didn't get the sense I was growing my civilization.

That said, I think the game is solid and there are plenty of opportunities to employ strategy. The problem is for me, I've seen it all before and it comes down to number crunching. Like Stone Age, much of your scoring depends on the multipliers you get from the cards, but there is no thrill of chance or the ability to block a player's action, like there is in Stone Age.

Played with 5 players. Too much down time with analysis-paralysis.

RATING: 9.5

A great economic game with a relatively simple rules set.  Every play matters.  When you play your cards (someone may copy your move), when you buy cards(weighting will it be there next turn against making other cards less expensive for your opponents), when/where you move your colonists (will those cities be more expensive next turn). Every play matters, because every play impacts your opponents choices and offers you potential synergies.

One of the biggest synergies in the game are the cards.  The cards you purchase give you spacial abilities, but they also give you end game multipliers.

This is a really nice game of expanding your trade empire, producing goods and collecting cards to give you certain abilities and victory points at the end. You can walk over land or sail. Each round you play a card from your hand to do certain actions. At some point you play a card to bring them all back into your hand. There is a diplomacy card that lets you play off other players cards. There is also some interaction since if you produce in a region this activates the production of other players in the region. Maybe the only weakness is you really have no idea how the other players are doing until the end. This is fine to me. Just enjoy playing your own game and see how it works out in the end.

An instant modern classic!
I am a big fan of Mac Gerdts's designs, even among them Concordia stands out. It is extremely simple and streamlined yet offers a rich array of strategy and depth. It holds up exceptionally well to repeated plays, and handles 2-5 players very well.

On your turn you play a card and do the action. There are 8 different actions and you have only 6 of these in your opening hand. In order to score points you must build in cities and also acquire action cards (each of which provides end game points for having built cities in certain ways).

The beauty of the game is in the player interaction. You care a lot what other players are doing. If they build in a city it increases the price for you to also build there. If they produce in a province you will gain resources from the cities you've built in that province. If they have meeples occupying spaces you cannot end your turn there, which limits where you can build. And most importantly, they can buy cards from the common card row. 

The game rewards planning and predicting what others are going to do. Add the excellent salsa expansion and one of the other map expansions and you have enough variety to enjoy this game for at least hundreds of plays.

Even though Concordia doesn't feature a rondel it is clearly recognizable as a Mac Gerdts game by the way players define their endgame scoring themselves. This time, players buy action cards that more importantly count as multipliers for game end scoring in one of six categories (e.g. cities built, provinces settled, number of goods produced). 
The rondel has been replaced with these cards resembling a deck-building mechanism. Instead of random shuffles players have all of them available. Once discarded a player can pick them up again with another card allowing this. As dictated by the VP conditions, players stream out of Rome with their colonists to build new cities that can be used to produce resources to build other cities or buy action/VP cards. The map-based gameplay is a nice element in these worker placement-driven times.
Concordia is a fine game of efficiency in resource conversion. In our game, all four players ended up very close between 109 and 115 VPs. It's to be seen how much possibilities there are for more focussed strategic play instead of our mainly tactical optimizations. In the case of Concordia, the better might turn out to be the enemy of the good with [gameid=66589] filling the same niche and [gameid=24181] providing a richer although different experience.

RATING: 8
I really like the way the mechanics work in Concordia. It feels as though the hand management part of the game is about deciding what part of your turn you want to do at what time. I've also noticed that the most successful people in Concordia know what they need and when and don't care if it will help other players. 

Essentially, you have cards that each represent a single action. Together, all those cards make up one complete turn. The truly deep strategy comes from deciding what you will do and when. The diplomat card may be one of the best innovations here. It lets you copy a card from another player, but they have to have just played that card last turn. Sometimes you'll sit there waiting and waiting for someone to play a certain card, but you're possibly ruining your own potential in doing that.

The theme would not come across for me had it not included custom wooden pieces. 

I would also like to note that the instructions in this game are the most elegant I've yet seen. After playing the game twice I assumed that the rule book would be between 12-20 pages. It is 2 pages front and back. It is the same size as Ticket to Ride instructions. That to me is amazing design.

Feb 17 Excellent game. Love playing. Have the Salsa expansion which is great. The only drawback is that it isn't an entry-level game (vis a vie Ticket to Ride) so newbies usually need a game under their belt to fully appreciate the importance of the patrician cards for end-game scoring. However, they're usually excited to play another game once they see how the scoring works.

June 17 - Bumping this up to a 10! The Salsa expansion is just awesome and everybody loves the Forum cards. Interestingly, the expansion doesn't add any time to the game length.

Xmas 17 - Still an awesome game. I love getting this out and playing it. It must be good when you come dead last but still enjoy the game. We don't play with salt anymore but we always use the Forum cards and the maps that came with Salsa. A must addition to any gamer's collection. PS Why is this not in the top 10?! Some of the games in the top 10 are way worse than this. I know; I've played some of them.

RATING: 8
Seems to me to be a "gamers" version of Catan, in that it scratches the same itch for me. Definitely a lot of cool mechanics in this one. It's very satisfying in that there does seems to be many different paths to victory, but you can't just do everything and anything and hope to maximize your score. I like that there feels like there's a high level of player interaction without any kind of "take-that" gameplay. The scoring at the end is complicated enough that I don't think anyone could ever hope to form a coherent strategy in their first few play-throughs of the game.

Probably the strongest design of Essen 2013. There's nothing revolutionary about Concordia. It's mostly a design that could've been published in 2001, the only nod to modernity is the hint at deck-building. But in this case the traditional design is the strength, as Concordia avoids the single player optimization spreadsheet syndrome that modern eurogame design is so susceptible to.

The board play is interesting enough, with a somewhat constrained topology and a need to race for the right cities to support the strategy. There's a moderate level of blocking, but for the most part it's of the nuisance variety rather than having the ability to kneecap opponents.

The core idea of the game is the way in which all action cards also function as VP category multipliers, which is clearly an evolution from Navegador's multiplier chips (and a big improvement). So it's not a typical engine building game of cranking up infrastructure first and VPs second. The means of production and the means of affecting the game are also the means of scoring VPs.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A wonderful game that is easy to teach and relatively quick playing for its weight. The theme is completely bland and pasted on, but the deck building element is fun and the player interaction (especially the leaching off of cards) and planning aspect is very fun. If we played this more I could see this moving up and becoming a favorite.

Another mish-mash of many Euro mechanisms. Fairly straightforward system. Produce goods, use goods to get cities = VPs. The scoring system is tight and easy to understand, but there just isn't anything new or exciting about this game. Its "yet another" Euro.

I need to play it more, and with more than 2P, but this game is pushing a 10. The only other thing that is holding it back is the scoring, which is wonky, difficult to teach and hard to efficiently track throughout the game. I especially do NOT like the Jupiter scoring. It's bordering on game breaking swingy, and all too EZ to capitalize on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really clear and easy to grasp, but hard to master card game using different boards as a way to differentiate the setup. On a quick look it looks like a board game about colonizing, but it is rather a handbuilding game and this mechanism gives place for some tough decision making: whether to take your cards back now or trying to utilize the leftovers further and gain some bonus money in the process; and especially which cards to add to your hand because besides of getting cards to support your card play strategy the cards also count as VP multipliers. There's a good level of complexity and very little downtime that's mainly coming from the use of Mercator as it requires some counting as well as the first/second turn Architect optimization. What I also like is the aspect that you have to really keep an eye on what cards others are playing because of the Diplomat. All in all this is deceptively simple, play a card a turn elegance, but it is also very dry.

Pretty open and friendly design, very little conflict.  It was fun to collect and use cards, longish scoring is a small downvote.  Easy rules give a big space of choices.  I was pushing myself to take quick turns though swimming in the choices a bit on my first play.  Seeing what the map situation _means_ (regions, which regions have already been harvested, and what each city produces) is rather hard to see without studying the map; again, I only played once so far.

I am enjoying this more and more each time I play it (even though I seem to be forgetting to log them all).  I should read the back story, I gather you are setting up some sort of trading empire in Roman times.  I don't actually care what the nitty gritty theme is as it plays very well.

The (semi) random set up of the provinces and the cards coming out in a different order each game means that there is always a slight difference.

Do you go for expensive goods? Do you go for colonists?  Do you go for many provinces? DO you go for different types of goods?  A combination of the above?  Do you set up operations in cities or hire people to assist you?

Decisions... Decisions...

Basically there is a lot going on and you can't do all of it.

One of the most positive heavy euros. Everything everyone does benefits themselves and sometimes others. There is little negative interaction on this (blocking others with your colonists or building where someone wants). The game has you thinking if I do this then I can do this and this so every turn you are thinking about doing wonderful things in the future and planning ahead. A very good euro. Absolutely recommend it. The only negative about it is the cover art but the game inside is so good you can easily neglect that part.

2016-12-28 - 7.5 - Pretty good euro game with very clean rules (4 pages of rulebook is awesome thing) with very indirect but really existing interaction. I guess it might be a good deep game to introduce to non gamers.

2017-05-29 - 7.5->7 - It lasts a little too long for my taste, although I still would like to play it most of the times.

2017-07-24 - 7->6.5 - I don't think that I'm going to suggest this game in most of the cases, although if someone would like to play I will gladly join. Nevertheless it's too long for what it is and since you do pretty much the same all the time it bothers me a little.

The elegant game mechanic of playing one action each turn may sound simple but the choices quickly become complex as your trade network expands. The integration of the scoring into the cards is quite tricky at first but after many plays it is now one of my favourite hidden scoring mechanics. It's a surprisingly deep game while being quite easy to teach.

Thinky and surprisingly complex for what is essentially a mid-weight Euro. Tricky to grok, I felt like I was doing poorly the whole game, but somehow won.

Highly recommended for those that prize efficiency of action and good ol' trading in the Mediterranean.

Concordia is a well designed game, but I'm not a fan of these "mini-action" games, where you decide what you are doing next and then spend up to half a dozen turns mechanically working towards that goal. Like you go "I'll build a building there" and then need to spend the next turns getting that done: get resources, trade them for another resources, take money, get building card back to hand, play a building card. Since Concordia is so light on randomness and player interaction, you rarely if ever need to alter your tactical decisions after you've set your mind on one, which makes the game very boring for me especially when combined to it's lengthy playing time.

RATING: 10
Wow. This game is SOOO GOOD. It totally absorbs you, you lose all track of time, forget to eat and drink, and all the stuff you need to think about, it's almost like programming. And then, at once, it switches from programming to panicky point grabbing for the day of reckoning is near. It has everything I love in a game, and it fits on the table too.
Easily 2 hours game time, but man it has no downtime at all, it's intense and amazing.
The discussion in the forum about point salad? No way! It has so many things to think about, to plan ahead, to make those aggravating choices letting go of some of those great goals. There is nothing point salad about this.

2 & 4 player. Not too complicated yet also quite clever. Good mixture of hand building and resource management. Not having any idea how well you're faring compared to others could be viewed as either a positive or a negative but unlike Archipelago, at least you know what you will get points for. Another positive is that you can sometimes plan (and possibly even do!) your move before it's your turn.

Biggest negative is the wealth of options can sometimes overwhelm you causing your brain to melt.

Reduced to 7 as I don't have much desire to play it again in a hurry, but it is a good game.

In Concordia, Gerdts recycles mechanics from his earlier games in a slightly different package. The rondel is replaced by personal action selection cards, that you can buy more with resources, and they also provide scoring multipliers in the end. They work in a very similar way the rondel does.

No match for Imperial in any way. Scoring needs some planning, which is nice. Nothing really new or novel here, but I'll happily try again.

A bit long compared what you get here. And Concordia is (again) one of these "plan many rounds ahead so you can do this and that couple of rounds later" - so what I mean here is that your one round actions are very tiny ones where you need to calculate and recalcute the steps you are taking to be effective enough later. And in the end the winner isn't that clear before you've calculated the collected cards.  So if you are asking from me, is this THE BEST game that came out at Spiel '13? - I can tell that it isn't, but it isn't bad game either... Just choose fast enough players and play with 4 AND then Concordia works well enough.

Gasp! a Mac Gerdts game without a roundel! =)  A nice deep game that combines hand building, map settling and various interlocking scoring metrics.  I like the choices, the far reaching effects of decisions, the limited but significant interaction with other players, etc.  On the downside, it's generally unclear who's leading and why throughout the game.  You have suspicions but they are just that.  The velocity also keeps ramping up and generally leads to a very abrupt end of play.  Then you count points, and you are sometimes surprised by who the winner is.

RATING: 5
It's a typical average euro game where nothing spectacular actually jump out of it. The action system with cards is interesting on a first glance because you get rewarded in gold if you managed to use many of them before taking your cards back. That is something I would be seeing in other games.

But the problem is the lack of structure. Instead of having a fixed number of actions, not only 1 action has 2 copies but you can also buy additional cards which increases your hand of cards making it more and more annoying to plan ahead your actions.

Personally, I would have made the new cards you bought replace the older ones so that you always have the same nb of actions you can use. There is also a lack of consistency in the actions cards because some are more powerful, but some other are the same. So why should I buy higher level cards if they do not bring me something new.

Also regarding those cards, it affect the way you will score points. Now this could get pretty confusing because you must first check if you can afford the cards, then check if it gives you an action you want and finally check if it will make you score a lot of points at the end, which you currently don't know. Maybe at the end of the game, there could be more reason to check for VP instead of the action since you might not have a chance to use it.

Finally, one of the thing that slightly annoyed me is that to place a house on a city that produce resource X, you need resource X. Well guess what, If I do want a city that produce X, is because I do not have any X resources. So you'll need to find other ways to get the resource.

Also buying and selling is pretty limited. I would have liked to be able to buy and sell more than 2 resource per turn. It would give me a reason to produce resources and sell them afterward. Else, I produce resource, it fills up my warehouse and I get stuck with it. So not very joyful.

I don't think it's a bad game, if you like euros, you could like this game, but it personally does not catch me at all.

I love the interaction of this game and the card system + board tactics are both very interesting.  Scoring and strategy is not easy to grasp in your first game.  I think I like many of these mechanisms that go together fairly well (creates a lot of interaction with direct confrontation) and it's not an offensive game at all.  

This Euro is all about synergizing your "end game scoring strategy" with accumulating the right multipliers (cards) to make your strategy payoff big.  I think it rewards players who can build enough on the board tactically while find enough good cards that match what they're doing on the board.  If one accumulates too many cards, it might not help.  Also, like many Euro games, pursuing things which other people are not directly doing is advantageous usually.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I must admit I was ignoring this title as I generally don't enjoy Mac Gerdt's titles but this one is okay...I won't run away screaming and there isn't an established rondel that must be used although one could argue the cards form a different type of rondel.  There's a pleasant balance to be found between obtaining additional cards to assist with scoring/additional actions and building cities.  I'd be open to playing this one again.  My first play was a bit disjointed due to the smallish print on the cards but as you become familiar with the cards, the text becomes largely irrelevant.  

========================================

Upped my rating to a 7 after my second play.  I'm finding this one more interesting and it may be slowly entering the buy zone.  My main concern with the game is that there can be considerable AP at times when one has all their cards in hand...

========================================

Keeping my rating at a 7 but sold my copy. This game takes about 30 minutes longer with my group than I prefer. Still happy to play from time to time, but can play someone else's copy.

The game does not give obvious goals at the beginning: there are many options to follow. I prefer to have clearer incentives, as this gives some nice clarity. 

I am not a big fan of the point salad at the end: it is hard to know why you win or why you lose.

The game ends up being an exercise in organization and optmization… unfortunately like many other euros. 

A key to winning might be to count enough to value of cards so as to better see needs and opportunities. 

Otherwise, the rules are clear and simple enough (we missed a few rules: two *types* of goods, moves by multiple stems). 

Nice material. Nice map. The card powers are simple enough.

RATING: 7.5
I like this game a lot.  I struggle with balancing in-game objectives with card-collecting so that I can really maximize end-game scoring (which is basically just game scoring).  If you can really wrap your head around the fact that all your city buying and goods-trading/selling is really only good if you have a decent collection of cards for each objective, you can have a lot of fun with this game and score A LOT of points!

This is really an amazing, very thinky game. It's fantastic how they vary the setup every time. Not terribly much, but enough so that you can't develop a single best strategy. It's also very cool how you can't really see how other players are doing until the very end.
A very enjoyable game with very little take-that to it.

I admit it: Upon viewing this game, with its resources, its map of the Mediterranean, its "whatever" title, its box cover of Some White Person With a Boat in the Background, I was not expecting much out of it. But I ended up liking it a bunch. It looks more overwrought than it is, and ability to plan your moves and your scoring without a bunch of ridiculous "but don't neglect THIS, or else you can't win!" nonsense tacked on to ensure you visit every area of the game OR ELSE was refreshing. There's still a little Eurojunk rattling around, such as restrictions on buying new cards that seem to exist solely to give the opportunity to have a card that avoids them, but otherwise it's a nice step back from the current trend of piling everything at arm's reach into a game and then hoping that interesting play emerges. That said, I'm not certain there are more than a handful of plays in this.

Good game, very long strategy, you must specialize on the god's cards to multiply at the end of the game, at least 3-4 moves ahead, it's a complete point salad, I think the best strategy is to at least build on every province and let the others win resources for you.

A gentle and generous econ game, up to 5 players spread their merchants across cities, setting up production and trading posts. Because of the varied and flexible actions, players are rarely left with moves that don't push them forward, and often find themselves boosting their opponents along as well, creating an econ game where forward momentum is easy to come by and exciting until the end.

Played surprisingly smooth even with 5 players. Both plays so far felt kind of the same unfortunately. The game gives you quite a few choices though, and is quite easy to teach once you've played it once. The lack of engagement in other people's turns would probably be my biggest gripe, the fact you can often leave the table between turns and basically miss nothing consequential can make waiting for AP players a little frustrating.

This game combines hand building for different actions, trading of goods, multiple paths to victory, and a very cool by-region resource production mechanic seamlessly, while having cool shaped pieces and a vibrant board.

While fairly different in several respects, this to me is the modern Settlers of Catan.  It nixes trading, but has the expansion/race aspect of settlers, the resource gathering/management, and really captures a lot of the same feel.  Meanwhile, it adds a lot more player interaction (while still avoiding direct conflict) and a lot more options for strategies, etc.  It has a lot more depth without being too complex.  Still has that streamlined, clean feel.

I really like how elegant this game is.  It is not groundbreaking but it combines a lot of mechanics that work well and puts them into a very smooth experience.

8.5 after second play.  Lots of different strategies are all viable and everyone had scores that were very close to one another.  Everyone carved out their own niche during the game.

A great resource management game. You can gather resources and sell them to add colonies to cities.  This helps to produce more resources.

A fun, almost family-weight game.

[b]Concordia[/b] has grown on me over the years.  At one point, I was ready to sell it, but was persuaded to give it another go.  So far, so good.  It's a streamlined Euro that's quick to play and has just enough theme to match with mechanics/actions.  But as clear as the game play is, the scoring is like mud.  It isn't done until the end and because it requires knowing what cards each player holds, during the game, there isn't a clear sense of who is winning and of who is losing.

Charming game for some reasons, disappointing for some others. Kind of a summary of all the twists that made Mac Gerdts' games so appreciated, beautiful and top quality materials and incredibly simple and elegant rules.
With that being said, what makes me like this game way less than other Euros in my collection (including other Gerdts' games) is that while you play you feel that it's something already done, something already seen. 
Plus, its most original element, i.e. the scoring phase at the end of the game, makes me puzzled; during my games I can hardly manage what's the situation at the other ends of the table, so I try to do the maximum points and thus postpone the end of the game, often doing a favor to other players. 
Maybe it's just me, but it feels like Concordia is not a very governable game in terms of scoring.

First impression after 2 games (2p and 3p).

Perfect combination of easy to teach/learn, yet feels heavy. Very little downtime, due to the "play 1 card" as all a player does each turn.

I also enjoy the randomness that's added through player actions, so that the games state changes with possible impact on your strategic decisions - shifting descisions from being mostly stragegic in the beginning of the game, to being more  tactical towards the end of the game.

If it wasn't that so many people were enthusiastic about this game, then i wouldn't have played it. Because the box nor the board, look inviting. 

But now that i've made that effort, I do understand the enthusiasm. This is a fast playing game with lots of ways to score points, different strategies to win. 

Playing one of your cards each turn, is something that everyone should be able to do. But of course, the order that you play them , and the ones you add to your deck, makes the difference.

Not sure yet about replay ability. You could say, its just a "multiplier collection" game, but it doesn't really feel that way.

If I need to say something negative, it's play length and down time with 5 players. 
Another downside, is that during the game, it's difficult to get an idea about who is winning. That has a negative influence on game tension.

Deck management/action selection.  However, instead of being a static set of actions available to everybody, you have to purchase the actions (cards) that benefit you the most so you can use them over and over.  You need to manage resources well and try to be efficient as possible while chasing the VP opportunities in your hand of cards.  Amazing.

Man did I enjoy this game. Only one play so far, but it has a really tight playstyle, with a small amount of randomness in what cities produce which goods and the semi-randomness of which cards come out first, but it just feels so nice to play. The rules are FOUR sides of A4. For a game this deep that is complete nonsense.

I think this game offers a great deal and I really enjoyed it.  Figuring out where to move your colonists early and managing you hand to maximize your efficiency are interesting choices that one has to make throughout the game.  Havign tyhe cards themseleves represent victory points is also an interesting change of pace.  Thus far, I find this game very interesting and look forward to playing it again.

I love euro's. This appears to be one of the most popular games in the action selection category. I was not impressed. A good game but not great. Maybe a little overhyped. I'm not a fan of massive end game scoring that is hidden. The involvement and decisions you make feel detached and distant. I could see this being a great strategic game with multiple plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Rating based on 5 players.

I played this game to test whether I really do not like low-interaction, many-paths-to-victory games, and I think it is now confirmed. The reason is that I completely see the greatness of Concordia, as it's smooth to play, relatively simple, has cute little bits, there's tough hand management, and you have to carefully plan ahead... but it just did not interest me, as for me it boils down to making an engine for resource conversion. If you like that kind of game, you will probably love Concordia, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to you... but it's just not for me.

FUN: accomplishes a lot with very simple rules. The way scoring works ensures that it's almost impossible to determine who is in the lead and by how much. This keeps things tense till the end.

UNIQUE: the way the action cards tie to your scoring is brilliant. 

NEGATIVES: The game looks terribly drab to me.

I'm playing this pretty much any time I get the chance at the moment, I really like it. That's probably somewhat affected by my above the norm (for me) success rate - something I expect will fall off as I play with more experienced players.

I like Mac Gerts games and I like rondels (even pseudo rondels like here). This one is very clever because although it's 'play a card, take the action, next player' what you can do on your turn can be a hard choice. Similarly, it's a set-collecting game, but the nuance is in exactly which sets to collect. Currently the dominant strategy seems to be Jupiter/Saturn with either Mercury or Minerva to supplement. Hopefully we'll see some evolution in future games, though letting go of Jupiter or Saturn will cede it to others who will gain huge benefit.

On reflection after a *lot* of games on BaJ, I've come to the conclusion that the Minerva strategy is important, rather than a supplement. To the extent that if anyone gets hold of one more Minerva than everyone else, that person will likely win; getting Vintner and Cloth Merchant is a killer combo.

The more I play Concordia the better it gets. Highly recommend the "Salsa" expansion and all the additional maps. Simply the best game that Mac Gerdts has ever made and he has made some great ones. You owe it to yourself to grab a copy and Concordia and get it to the table

I was originally put off by the eponymous "Trading the Mediterranean Theme" but the buzz got me interested. 

A great game of efficiency.  Newer players quickly discover that it is a mistake to try and do everything.  The best play is to try and play to certain gods that you are trying to collect (and, of course, try to collect gods that no-one else is going for).  Streamlined card play make turns quick, particularly for a slightly heavier strategic game.  There are interesting decisions as you face a trade-off between efficiency and tempo.  I definitely recommend everyone try this game at least once.

RATING: 8
Concordia feels like a throwback euro with some modern additions. The rules are quite simple (4-page rulebook), yet there are a large number of strategic and tactical decisions to make. One can come up with an outline of a strategy based on the random setup of goods and cards, but will need to deviate based on other players' actions. The emerging chaos in the game feels player driven as opposed to many modern euros in which you seem to be competing against the game itself. Determining the order in which to execute your card actions (as well as when to pick up your deck and start over) is fascinating as is determining which cards to purchase. The game offers 5-6 ways in which to score points and each card acts as a multiplier for one of the scoring categories in addition to building your deck and offering in-game actions. The game plays in 90 minutes with 3-4 players and runs very smoothly as each player plays a single card per turn.

02/01/14 Played a three-player game in 2.25 hours. 
I liked Concordia. The rules are not complex. But for me at least it was overwhelming the first time without some specific strategy guidance. I'd not only do better in future but I'd enjoy it more now that I have a good grasp of what I should be doing (instead of "here's a bunch of cards, play them in whatever order you want and hope for the best"). Too many choices was giving me analysis paralysis. Though I find no fault with the design or components. And only one icon caused a question during the game.

Mac Gerdts was robbed in broad daylight.  How this game did not win SDJ or the Kennerspiel, is beyond me.  Camel Up really is a light filler game that wears thin in five minutes.  Istanbul tanks.  Concordia was easily the SDJ or Kennerspiel winner, but politics and a certain game company (named after a winged fabled horse) mugged Gerdts for the gold.  This will be the last year I ever buy an SDJ or Kennerspiel game without playing someone else's copy first.

Although the theme isn't really strong in this game I enjoyed the gameplay a lot in my first play.

Rules are pretty straighforward, no little exceptions, but still enough opportunities to try out various tactics & strategies. And the outcome of the game WILL be determined a lot by the way people are playing it, there's room enough for the 'groupthink' metagame, which I like.

Made it to my 'consider buying it' list after one play.

This game works well, and the overall play is fairly intuitive and easy to get into.  However, I just haven't generally found my plays very interesting.  There is some interaction with players through the Prefect and Diplomat roles, but in the end it just feels like I'm spending 2-3 turns to build up resources, then spending them on buildings or cards, then repeating that over and over.  Even as a fan of fairly dry euros, I find the short-term combos in here a bit enjoyable but the game overall just doesn't wow me.

Really enjoy this with any player count. Very nice mix of deck building, hand management and resource management. You also have a little area control in the sense that it is cheaper to build first in a production area, so early game "blocking" is possible. 

Very simple gameplay (choose a card from your hand, play the card, do the action) but choices can be agonizing - as with many good games, it feels like everything you do is one step behind where you want to be. There can be downtime waiting for your turn, but I use that to plan, especially as things you think you want to do might go away as others take their turn and you have to quickly re-plan. Even when many players are new, they get into a rhythm of planning and executing, so turns progressively get faster. Production quality is excellent - except for the horrid box cover art...

Much better than the rondel games.  Still restricting your choices, but the ability to add new cards to allow a wider variety of actions is a nice feature.  Quite a few decision points in the game, which was great.  Variable map rsourse allotment could help a bit, although not so very important what resources you get as almost any are useful.  The scoring base on the cards taken is also an interesting choice, one I should have paid more attention to.

According to geek buddy comments and Ryan Metzler's (slaqr) review maybe this is too light for my taste. I first thought that the cards instead of rondel (and the option of buying more cards/abilities) are a nice idea, but the actual actions seem a bit too basic, making it not much different from other lighter economic games.

Update: Traded for it anyway. :-)
Might still make a good step from the level of gateway games for new gamers.

First (4p) game took a ridiculously long time compared to the laughable 90 min estimate on the box. I enjoyed the mental gear-shifting that a well-designed euro's mechanics will provide. I especially liked the decreasing possible actions, then reset of the Tribune. Like most games of this type, I would welcome the pleasure of increased mastery and exploring strategies through multiple plays and sincerely doubt those will ever manifest. Another "would be great to get to the table a bunch... guess I'll have to wait for the app to play it as much as I'd like."

RATING: 6.8
Has potential but a very generic euro that takes a lot from other games and does very little special in area control / area placement

After a second play I have to say that there is a serious disconnect with the gameplay (area control, growing things/ producing things/gaining resources) with the actual points at the end of the game when you go to a Feldian like point smorgasbord.

Concordia is a very well designed game that, despite focusing on resource management and conversion, manages to feel different from all the other games that do the same thing. One huge divergence is that that there's no tired worker placement; instead there's a clever mix of card drafting, hand management, and navigating a board whose setup changes with every game. Like other games of its ilk, Concordia creates some pretty clear boundaries for effective play: sure you can [i]try[/i] to build only houses at the expense of getting cards, but you won't win...and vice versa. But within these bounds, there's still a lot of variability for how you can approach the game. Some cards might combine well with others or how the board is laid out; it's up to you to notice these opportunities and pounce on them before others do. But you might pay a steep price to get exactly what you want, creating opportunities for others to carve a strategy from the unappreciated cards and provinces at a discount. All in all, I definitely can see myself getting at least a few plays out of this. Solid.

Although this game is very recent, it feels like a classic Eurogame in which the mechanics work perfectly together... Rule-wise, it's quite easy (rules fit on 4 pages including examples), but strategically, it's at the high end! An excellent game with a good flow, rules are very easy but mastering the game is something else because there are a lot of things that you need to consider. Buying cards is crucial in order to get points, but don't forget about the board as without settlements, you don't get points either. Only downside is that scores are only calculated at the very end of the game so you cannot easily see who's in the lead and that the game is not very forgiving.

RATING: 7.8
Played this at an open games meet-up and really quite enjoyed it. The game was a bit slow for the first half but as it was played by four new players (myself included) and one explainer who hadn’t played much himself this wasn’t too surprising. As we got our heads around the mechanics the gameplay sped up and people started thinking about strategy rather than rules which, for mine, is always a good sign in a game.

I liked how the game played, there are multiple paths to victory, interesting ways that players can make life difficult for their opponents as well as genuine and challenging decisions every turn about what role to use and where to concentrate ones efforts. This is complimented by high-quality components and attractive artwork that really compliment the Roman theme. From my one play I suspect that this game has great replayability.

In the game I played the first four players ended up all within five or six points of each other despite all having very different approaches. I would definitely play this game again and would consider for purchase if the price was right.

A beautiful-looking trading-in-the-Mediterranean game with an interesting card-driven action selection mechanism.  I feel that the game is a bit too long: the game doesn't end until all players plateau at a position where they all collect about 10 points from each of the major scoring categories.  This "balance" means that there is no real competition, nor blocking: everything you might do will be roughly equal in the end.

The more I play this game, the more I like it. I am definitely a "Novelty Junkie" (I love learning new games), but I just want to keep playing this one. Edited my rating up to a 10 now that I have a few plays in. The only criticism I have is that folks tend to go into vapor lock toward the end of the game when the curtain is near to being lowered. But that actually speaks well of the design. Brilliant design. And for a game with so much depth, it is disproportionately easy to teach. Not absolutely easy, but compared to the complexity of the strategies, it is pretty straightforward. Play a card, do the action. This also makes for fairly brisk gameplay when folks know the game, know what they want to do and simply execute.

The cover is unspeakably ugly considering the game itself is quite handsome. Dry but extremely elegant game. Building your engine (the right combo of cards, resources, money, houses, ship/colonist positioning) is very hard to do without wasting valuable turns... and virtually anything you do to benefit yourself is going to help someone else (giving them goods, access to cheaper cards, letting them mooch an action via Diplomat cards). So the cost-benefit analysis of any given move is extremely deep for a game with such simple rules.

Cool Game.. One of those game where the gameplay is really simple, play a card do the action.. but its oh so much deeper than that with tactical thinking..

No nastiness and No fighting in this game is a definite positive for my tastes... 
Played with 2 player and 3 player maps works well with both.. Concerned with a higher play count that there may be a lot of down time..

Looks and feels a bit like Navegador but plays a bit like the exploration phase in Olympos. You are exploring areas from which you can then generate resources. There is a small deck building element to the game and you use the resources to build your deck cards. is this the new rondel?

I liked it, the board and the theme are very pleasant, the action cards are interesting to play and the area control is has impact on the final victory. The only flaw, in my opinion, is the multiplicative action cards you can buy to boost you points at the end, sometimes it can be so long before you can actually have the resources to buy them that the one that interesting can be gone and it is quite frustrating.

Imperial, Navegador, and now Concordia.  All brilliant games.  Mr. Gerdts has talent.

Game play is great, but a bit more dry/abstracted than Navegador.

Another soulless Euro. The only interesting thing about this game is the hand-building, which is so micro-managed with the order that cards become available that there's nothing exciting about it at all. I'm convinced that the endgame scoring is so overly-balanced that players are only going to win by a point or two, no matter what cards they get over the course of the game. Just an extremely dry game.

Would much rather play Rococo.

RATING: 7
I'm a bit ambivalent about Concordia. On one hand, I really like the action mechanic, where your actions are represented by cards and that you choose in which order to play them. Your goal is to expand your trade network but you will constantly be faced with challenges like "I need a wheat market to produce wheat but I need wheat to build a wheat market". There is also a good balance between accomplishing good things on the map and buying new action cards that earns you victory points for how well you did on the map.

On the other hand, the action cards you buy don't give you new or better options, just more of the same, so the gameplay changes little from action card cycle to cycle and the game feels slightly too long. Also, the lack of in-game scoring makes the end-game scoring too long.

Concordia is still a great game but I think similar games like Hansa Teutonica and Lancaster has some tension and variety during the game.

In ancient Rome, each player starts with an identical hand of 7 cards. Cards allow one to collect income, move colonists, build cities, and buy other cards. Each card is also worth game ending VPs. Points are scored in a variety of ways: diversity of cities in provices, diversity in different types of cities, number of colonists and so forth.

There is no Rondel, but you could think of the cards as the rondel. There is a card that lets you pick up all your played cards, so it is similar. There's lots to think about, and lot of tension about who gets to the card display first. 

Whoever triggers the game end gets a 7 VP bonus. I've been victimized by this a couple of times, and also I've gotten the 7 VP bonus and lost. I assume the designer has gone over the playtesting to determine that 7 VP is the right award - it just seems a bit unscientific to me and depending on turn order, you could be deprived one turn relative to other people. So there is something about trying to equalize the turn order that nags at me, but it's an interesting game.

Took a little to get into it, but it was overall smooth learning given how everything is on the card. The Summary cards should have some more text, and I'd prefer numbers on double-sided coins, but roman numerals are okay.

The gameplay was fine. It wasn't the engine-building killer I hoped it would be (was hoping it'd be like a hand-based Dominion) and the theme is a bit dry, but I like how smooth it was. Downtime was average and very bearable I think, as there was a lot to think about. I think this is a decent euro game, but I wish it had a bit more excitement/life. Need more replays to kink out my full feelings but its only an okay euro game for now.

Overall didnt click for me well enough. I think its because its hard to wrap your head around the scoring and the cards were more rehashes of the same thing, just in increased power or combinations. If the cards were more dynamic in play ability and effects and the scoring was more intutive and relateable/calculable from the board state, I think Id enjoy this much more. A game with semi smilar scoring that I think works better is Orleans. The "multiuse" of the cards is also a bit of a misnomer as there is usually only one active effect and just a passive scoring one so you can only "use" it during the gameplay for one thing usually.

If you view deck-building with distaste you should not be dissuaded from trying Concordia.  It's an economic/network-building game with elements of hand management.

Concordia has very elegant, beautiful and easy to teach rules offering a deep game experience at the same time.

Very replayable: different situations in each game. Very short waiting time (one move for player, one after the other, as most of the games by its designer). It is easy to concentrate on the game (not fiddly at all). Very beautiful material, both the map and the wooden pieces. It offers both strategy and tactics. 

The only thing that stops me giving it a ten is that the choices are somehow interesting, but the effect of choosing one path instead of another is not dramatic, very few points are at stage. This allows for a well-balanced game, but a bit less exciting and tense to play. But it is close to being a ten and I can possibly increase the rating in the future.

It has the further advantage that it is a game for all occasions, since it can be taught in a few minutes, it is not long  and it scales very well (it can be played from 2 to 5 players). 

Recommended.

Mechanically, Concordia isn't a bad game, but it has too many flaws to be worth buying.

For one thing, inexperience with Concordia can lead to poor early moves that will affect a player for the rest of the game, leading that player to feel like there is no hope for victory very early on.

Scarcity of resources can cause turns to be wasted due to not being able to afford any decent actions. 

Most negatively, potential for actions you are wanting to take being taken by other players before your chance negates the usefulness of planning ahead. Combined with a lack of player interaction means players don't even pay attention to the turns of others, wait for their turn to come around, and only then assess the current situation before executing an action. This leads to Analysis Paralysis, long turns, and people getting bored between their own turns and leaving the table or playing with their phones.

Concordia has decent components, a decent board layout, and is not really a bad game, but all its flaws outweigh any positives the game may have.

What a beautiful game board!  

I remember loving the game play of this game, but being a bit confused on a successful strategy to get implemented.  I loved how scoring for certain items will effect what your opponents do.  

I really would like to play this game again...

Everyone has been waxing on how great this game is and I'm not sure I completely agree. I think I liked it, it did feel a bit different, sorta hand building combined with Mission Red Planet type playing of cards. I'll play it again, but I feel as if I'd have liked this much more a few years ago.

RATING: 7
A Gerdts with no rondel, didn't think I would see the day. Concordia reminded me a great deal of Trajan, for the fact that this is a game of using various methods to acquire victory points, and there is no punishment or threat of losing VPs. The simple gameplay mechanism of "play a card each turn" is very elegant and to be commended. The learning curve is steep, because interplay between the cards is complex (reminiscent of Lewis & Clark, but with fewer cards), and the scoring is not entirely intuitive (and yet, very similar to Stone Age -- cards act as multipliers to some other criteria in the game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's the Eurogame take on Lewis & Clark (less racing, more area control and set collection) and it scratches a similar itch but is different enough to justify both in a library.  It's less luck-swingy than L&C, for both good-and-ill.

RATING: 4
Card driven rondel game with ability to purchase new cards that become part of the rondel. In the game you play  different cards from your hand. The basic cards allow: your colonists to move around a map and build production centers; produce goods; buy or sell goods for money; buy cards with goods; copy someone's action; take your played cards back into your hand with a possibility to introduce a new colonist.
At game end all purchased cards score points. there are cards that score: all your colonists; production centers dependent on the good type; production centers in different provinces etc.
The game is well put together, but just like most rondel games, feels repetitive, there is a cycle of building, producing, trading with occasional card purchases. I was a little bored, hence the lower rating.

RATING: 8.5
Medium lenght and complexity economic game featuring a very atttractive cdeck building mechanism. The whole game revolves about it:
-> You just do one action per turn, the action marked by the card you play.
-> These cards also state the ammount of points you will win at the end.

Consequently, the game goes on very fast (barring AP prone players). There are many things you can do, and many moments to do them. The challenge is to choose the right ones, and do them in the right moment.

Those actions also have a physical reflection on a map, and that's where the interaction with the other players will happen (and in the market of available cards, and the exploitation of the regions).

The rules are simple and elegant, making it a game that will be loved by many people, not exclusively by gamers.

The experience is different depending on the number of players and although there are not a lot of variable elements (just the available cards), the changes they produce in the game are huge.

I really love the game classic aesthetics (once I'm past beyong its the rather dull cover).

It's become my favourite Mac Gerdts game!

RATING: 8
Deserves the praise it receives. The kind of game where it feels like you are actually building towards something - in this case, a trading empire.

My only "complaint" is that the early game seems to rush by a bit quickly, with players having several cities built in a hurry.  It's only a minor problem though - would be nice to see the early stages stretched out a bit, but it doesn't ruin what is otherwise a highly-enjoyable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun experience that gets better each time. My best explanation of why it's fun as that each turn feels good  - like you ended up making progress towards something. I initially disliked the scoring, but I appreciate it more after every play. The game can drag a bit sometimes in the later stages of the game due to the amount of choices that can be made.

RATING: 6.5
Ha tutte le carte in regole per diventare un gioco di grande successo, regolamento lineare e semplice, interazione notevole, durata contenuta e la necessità di pianificare e programmare ogni mossa. Occhi sempre aperti sulle mosse degli avversari, su come si espandono e quali carte stanno accumulando, una volta scoperta la loro strategia idearne una propria costruendo e collezionando carte. L'attenzione è spesso rivolta all'espansione ma i punti vittoria saranno moltiplicati con le carte in mano anche se è vero che colonizzare e aumentare il numero di coloni è molto utile.

RATING: 9
Like nearly all Mac Gerdts games, Concordia doesn't really offer anything new. At least there's no rondel this time around, but there is a personal card-stack system adapted from Castle for all Seasons, although it can't be denied that having each card contribute to end-game scoring is a sweet touch.

Concordia ultimately wins its spurs by being tense, competitive, easy to teach and unpredictable: essentially the same great traits as nearly all its progenitors.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent ancient business building game. The mechanics are so smooth too. 4/3/2014

Verdict:

What I Like: Yes former self, these mechanics are smooth. Mechanically everything makes perfect sense and fits together like a glove (theme you ask? unimportant. not a negative). The game has very low rules overhead but is satisfyingly deep. Deck building to gain more action availability as well as endgame point multipliers is a fascinating addition. Cards drive board play which in turn informs card worth, balance between the two is key. I like that a players control of game length is important to strategy, and that everyone will often avoid good moves as long as possible to deny their opponents great ones. Games of brinksmanship are common here and quite fun.

What I Don't Like: The endgame scoring is somewhat blind. I can usually guess approximately how many points my opponents have, but not always. Scoring itself can be unintuitive for new players.

This is a beautiful example of blending several mechanics in a fascinating way that you can't believe didn't already exist. 

The pseudo-deck building is extremely satisfying as the cards not only steer the possible actions for you to take, but they also determine your end game goals. 

The escalation and engine building feels extremely satisfying. The interaction between players on the board is strong and yet not crippling as no one is ever blocked from an area. They simply require more money to move in.

[b]Concordia[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Concordia is a game that instantly became a favorite after my first play. It offers a such smooth play experience and elegant rule set. The rules are intuitive, everything makes sense (you'll never look up rules while playing). You can teach this game in minutes, but the true beauty of the game is the depth of strategy found in Concordia. Add in the Britannia expansion map and you have an very tight 2p map (which solves the base game's only flaw). I think Concordia will become a classic that is still being played 10 years from now.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- I love the decision space in this game, planning out your colony expansion while managing your resources and income [i](pure Euro goodness)[/i].
- Plays great with 2; I just ordered the expansion map which should make the 2p experience even better.
- Card management; not only do the cards in your hand provide you with the actions you can take, they also have a scoring rule attached to them. You only score points based on the cards you collect.
- Low rules overhead, this is a very clean design.
(Once you start playing you have a card that lists the scoring opportunities and cost for establishing cities and that is about all yo need to reference while playing.)

I appreciate how focused this design is, the challenge lies in how you play the game in the confines of a very simple and elegant rule set, not in wrestling with a complex rule set full of exceptions and special circumstances. I'm hopeful that this game will see double digit plays by this time next year (I could easily see it becoming one of my favorites).[/i]

At first glance, Concordia seems like a 4x game set in Rome but you'd be wrong. Instead, it relies on predicting what goals your opponents are pursuing and outpacing them. The central mechanic of the game is card-drafting/hand management which takes the sting out of the territory control. There is no attacking or blocking in this game but there is beating your opponents to the punch a split second before they get the card they want. Plus, I love any game where there are multiple strategies to victory. Constantly engaging, turns are swift and are only one action, Concordia is a peaceful civilization game I'll play again and again. Can't wait to try the various maps!

All the stuff I like in a Euro - no round based stuff, a good tactical decision each turn, a strategy that develops based on the map and card availability that helps drive the tactics, indirect pussage (there being a race for resource generators and cards). It uses the card play/pickup system from Havana / Castle for all Seasons, but I like how when you buy more cards, they add to your hand to keep things going. I also like how you're rewarded for using as many cards as possible before pickup. There's a nice variety of ways to go about scoring points. You want to pay attention to what other people are doing to potentially leech off their card this turn, and also to direct your strategy to alternate ways to score points to minimise direct competition. I was engaged throughout, nice components, nice timeframe, potentially a touch long, and all requiring only 4 pages of rules + setup. An elegant system.

RATING: 9
Wonderful and Delightful Game! A lot going on, but many simple ideas keep it from melting the brain. "On your turn, play one card and do what it says." But that simple instruction has so many choices, without being overwhelming. Breath of fresh air. NOT multiplayer solitaire. Very little luck, and a good blend of tactics with strategy. Good with 2 players, but better with more.

Warning: AP alert, and much math involved in the scoring. Also, the resource costs are going to be a stumbling block for new players.

RATING: 7
"Amazing design, with tons of interaction, but no attacks and not even much denial. Deeper than I prefer in a game, and I fear that 2p would be quite cutthroat (with card purchases)."

What I like:
- Solid euro with no direct attacks
- Gorgeous map board (with 2 sides)
- Really clever hand/deck management with multiplier scoring
- No way to get completely blocked out on the map

What I don't like:
 - Seems to be very deep--prone to AP and brain burn
- 2p might be more cutthroat than I prefer
- EVERY card will come out AND be bought in most games 
- The box is awkwardly large

I would put the weight a bit higher than the BGG-voted 3.1. Not for complexity, but for depth. This is an excellent nomination for the KSdJ.

The mechanics in this game are very well thought out. The theme of course is just added on but the game play is great. You move your units around to build cities and collect resources with the end goal of collecting scoring cards which are also used to perform actions. There are several ways to score so you can focus on one type and multiply or spread out. Lots of player interaction also as you can block paths, everyone is collecting the same set of cards and production is shared by region. At 5 it gets expensive to build out so the game feels slower and you need to adapt your strategy.

Extraordinarily solid low-luck Eurogame.  Yeah, it's about moving around the Mediterranean, but despite that it absolutely knocks it out of the park in terms of making every choice you make interesting and difficult.  Not recommended for AP-prone play groups, but strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys a solid brain-burner.

After playing this more, I believe it's supplanted Princes of Florence as my favorite "traditional-style Eurogame," which is an impressive feat, as Princes has held that position for well over a decade.

The best thing you can say about Concordia is that its not too heavy, and it plays smoothly. But there is nothing original in it.
In my opinion, nothing Gerdts has done comes close to Imperial.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In Concordia, you're trying to build up your network of goods-producing cities, produce goods, and claim cards that will give you end-game multipliers.  It's all based around a hand of cards that can be played in any order, determining your action for the round.  The cards not only list an action, but an end-game multiplier, so acquiring new cards has multiple purposes.  The effectiveness of your actions is highly dependent on what other people are doing, making this a very tactical game.  Because the scoring multipliers are all in people's hands, it's often difficult to figure out how people are doing while the game is in progress.

Rules are incredibly simple, gameplay is quick and you do have some agonizing decisions during the game. The quality of the wooden pieces and the board is great. I wish the cards were linen; sleeved, the cards are just fine. I rate it an 8, but it borders a 9. I don't think it has enough "umph" though to push it there. Solid game, but not an amazing one.

Only randomness is the setup and the order in which the purchasable cards come out. Doesn't seem like much, but that provides just enough randomness to keep it fresh. I don't see this getting a TON of play, but I feel like it will be fun for 20-30 plays before it needs to be shelved for a while.

Points come from everywhere and I'm not sure why, but I think this works in this case because it's hard to make resources come from everywhere. Microturns mean you're always in the game, or about to be, and keeps downtime to a minimum (mostly).

Once I got over an initial feeling that scoring was all a bit muddy, I've loved Concordia, every single time. Except when I've played with over-calculating or AP-prone players, in which case it's a nightmare watching four microturns and one mega-slow undoing things 100 times turn. But generally: it's great.

Interesting mix of mechanics - build your own hand of cards (which also determine game end scoring for you) and use them during the game to play different actions to get hold of and exploit positions on the map. It has some downtime and restrictive gameplay in a way I did not always like but in general it´s a good game.  This also reminded me Antike, which I like more.

I love this game. In no particular order, 10 things I love:
1. Quick to learn. Short rule book! Intuitive to play.
2. It is a game of abundance, not famine.
3. There are many great options to choose from each turn, rather than a feeling of needing to identify 1 ideal move.
4. There are several ways to get the things you want; and if you still don't like those options, you can pivot your strategy and focus on getting something else.

Well, Concordia is just a great game about establishing trade houses and trading resources in ancient times. Seems dry? It is. But Concordia is a deceptively simple, very elegant game with deep gameplay. Opening the box and seeing just 4 pages of rules is a nice surprise indeed. It has a deck-building mechanism for action selection which sets it apart from it's competitors gameplay wise. Only negative is that the scoring (the most important part, I might add!) takes a few plays to get the hang of, and you have to be aware of what cards (the scoring is based on the cards) your opponents take from the ones on offer, not paying attention will often lose you the game. A definite keeper, glad it came back in print. Unfortunately does not work as well as a 2 player for us though, a bit too open and without a crowded map, the excitement kind of disappears, but we still play it 2 from time to time.

This game is probably the tightest bone dry euro I've played, not a huge tie to theme, very crunchy and abstract mechanics, all in a package that is just so tight.  Hard to explain why it is great exactly, but if you play it you'll most likely see.

really liked this one. the cards you buy to get more actions also determine what gives you points, and to get the cards you need resources, which you get by spreading out on the board (trying to be first, because that's cheaper, but you can always get in), and spreading out is easier if you invest in more dudes to have travel around the map. And there's a nice way that production works, where an area becomes unavailable for production after it has produced once, meaning that there are fewer and fewer areas that can still produce resources, until someone picks the companion action to producing and makes all areas available again (netting them money).

Concordia has a really interesting mix of route planning, action selection, and card drafting. I think the atrocious box cover had kept me away, but I wish it hadn’t. Very much looking forward to this again.

Some similar feeling to Navegador (primarily in the scoring) but a bit simpler/lighter. It seems to have fewer, or perhaps less important, timing decisions due to the nature of the market in this one. Still, the card mechanic is interesting, particularly your joint decision about scoring and future action space.

I got to play this at my local meetup today. I was very excited to give this game a try since it was on my wish list.

This game is heavy in a way that you don't know what you want to do. In the beginning the strategy isn't all that clear and the scoring is very opaque. I have no idea who is in the lead and what moves can get me the most points. That leaves me with the core mechanism of the game, which is a rondel with cards. At the end of the game besides the initial cards that we start with, we only ended up getting 3~4 more cards for the new player and the experienced player at 4~6 cards. 

Cards are extremely important because they provide end game scoring. It feels like the game you build up and build up and try to grab cards if you can and you really need to manage your actions well in order to do good or you will always be one step behind on what you would like to do. It's a pure Euro through and through. Try to maximize your production engine while not waste time over producing (wasting) it since space is limited.

I got a bad case of Analysis Paralysis sometimes in the game and so did my playmates. Even we have all the time in the world to plan it still bums us out when some place got taken or some resources being blocked from others.

The diplomat card (copy someone's last played card) is super important in this game. I like this mechanism though.

Only 2 plays so far, but I like it a LOT. And yes, the Britannia expansion is wonderful for 2p because it forces head-to-head competition. Granted, the "competition" isn't anywhere near as fierce as one might think. Paying 2 coins to build where your competitor has a presence turns out to be a minimal cost. Our first game we avoided each other like a plague and the play was odd. But in the second play we tried competing for settlements and the lightbulb came on. Getting somewhere first isn't about blocking an opponent, but merely a way of generating money for further expansion. As long as both players lead in at least one critical area, the money flows back and forth causing a bit of "feast or famine" which ebbs and flows and overlaps with the ebb and flow of the deck as you use it and renew it. Balancing deck construction, deck usage, expansion, and revenue from various sources (including 1st-settler premiums from opponents) is so cool. 

Great game... quite a bit of strategy is involved in this relatively mid-weight game.

Only one 3-player play in so far so score may change but first impression is this is an excellent game. The theme is definitely on the "dry" side but IMO not entirely lost on the game mechanics. While I'll admit I didn't get a strong sense of theme I did feel a bit of "atmosphere" for the historical/thematic elements. Where Concordia really shines though is in the ease of play, streamlined mechanics, while still offering a rich set of difficult choices. It's all about efficiency and optimization, knowing when is the right time to take any given action.
This definitely isn't for everyone but if you enjoy the type of eurogame this is, it's a definite win.

I finally got a chance to play this, and I'm not quite believing the hype. This is a "there's a lot to do and you can't do everything"-type of game. But it feels like you can't do anything well, just do a bunch of stuff for points and then the game ends. Sure, there are different strategies and different aspects to focus on, but no real engine-building or surprising moves or anything like that.  There are also a lot of constraints: you can't hoard goods, you can only play a certain card so many times, to build a city to gain a good you already need to have that good, getting cards early is prohibitively expensive, you can't dominate a region since you're rewarded for spreading out and leeching from others and so on. It's fine-tuning and grabbing points when the opportunity presents itself, which makes for a fine, but unexciting game.

Oh well, another lesson in boredom. Although a beautiful game (component-wise), it ends up in setting things up, and playing the cards. Even with only four players, waiting for your turn is tedious. You can try to calculate how much victory points you can possibly gain from this or from that card, but by doing this thoroughly, the game becomes even more boring and the turns need even more time ... the game also sports the ugliest cover I've seen in years. The artist must have had a bad day ...

First impressions: meh. Good, but a little dry. We usually don't mind dry games. Hell, a lot of our favorites are dry affairs, but Concordia just didn't engage us as much as we'd like. 

EDIT: Ended up auctioning it off. It's a solid game, but boring. Maybe I'll play it again someday (hopefully with more players) and maybe I'll change my mind.

EDIT 2: I wouldn't mind trying the Britannia map which makes the board a little tighter for two players. Then again, the Italia map we played on wasn't too bad for two.

Quite clearly the best designed game I'd played for some time and I enjoyed my play of it to the point of ordering my own copy: very smooth game play and lots of worthy decisions to make. Hard to categorise: it has resource and hand management, with area control and looks like it'll reward strategy very much. I rushed the endgame and caught my opponents napping by building all the Wheat and Brick cities, but that sort of thing is a viable strategy in many games: it worked well for me in this. Non-rondel wonder.

Peaceful expansion and economic development (Euro style interactions). Card drafting/deck building to take actions; clever mechanic to decide when to recall your deck (rather than just as it runs out like most games). Card drafting simultaneously provides lots of scoring options (set collecting).  After random board seeding (replay variability), luck influences very little. Scales well with two maps for higher or lower player counts.

Medium weight; simpler rules than you might expect, probably not a gateway but not terribly difficult to teach. Fairly classic, but emotionless/thinly themed Euro (blocking, resource management, puzzly, number crunching)

Remind me a bit of Stone Age (different resources, civilization cards that give tangible benefit and end game scoring, various viable strategic approaches) + Power Grid (area control, more expensive to move into occupied regions)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is a really fantastic game which combines what I like about resource management games with what I like about deckbuilding games with what I like about routebuilding games. I am so impressed with this thing. I love how every card in your hand gives you a different endgame point scoring category. I love how the weaker, lower cost resources are actually harder to get than the luxury resources.

Me ha gustado mucho y quiero jugarlo de nuevo. Es un perfecto ejemplo de lo que yo llamo una mecanica elegante: Reglas sencillas (baja una carta, resuelve lo que dice) con posibilidades variadas, decisiones interesantes y estrategia profunda.

Apela a jugadores casuales y competitivos por igual.

Es bueno para jugadores casuales dado que puedes jugarlo tranquilo, sin preocuparte del puntaje de los demas, como si estuvieras desarrollando tu empresa mercante en el imperio romano. Si hay otras empresa a tu alrededor pero tu solo tratas de hacer que la tuya sea lo mejor posible y si ganas el juego, en hora buena.

Por otro lado el jugador copetitivo debe estar pendiente de que cartas compran sus competidores para poder asi estimar cuantos puntos le dan sus distintas acciones, evitar que compre ciertas cartas que podrian darle fuertes puntajes, construir mas barato o colarse en una provincia para conseguir recursos gratis.

An intricate euro with a lot of interesting interlocking systems. The individual systems present interesting decisions to make: which general strategy to pursue, whether to pursue your long-term goals or pounce on a juicy short-term opportunity, which card role to use, when to refill your hand, whether to take resources or money, how your action will affect other players and vice versa, etc. Those elements would be good by themselves, but they all work together very smoothly to make fascinating decisions almost every turn. I like that most of the actions you take are pretty generous as well. I rarely feel like "I have to take this action to prevent my engine from withering or my people from starving". Instead, most turns are "These two options would really help me out in different ways. Which one do I do? Or should I take this slightly worse option because it will hamper other players?".

The only real downside is that the theme and presentation are bland and flavorless. This is the standard Euro theme of "Trading in the Mediterranean", which is so overdone that even jokes about it feel tired. Even so, the theme is strong enough to bind the gameplay elements together, so if the players are more interested in tough decisions and elegant interactions than theme, the game is excellent.

A great euro that really revolves around this novel hand management mechanic. The decisions of when to play which card involve plenty of strategy. There's also a bit of area control as well as resource management with the colonization and building. Money is also incredibly tight in the early phases of this game. The only issue I have for this game is that the scoring is hidden. It's hard to tell who is ahead and you have to be counting who has bought which cards, which will dictate scoring. This makes it very difficult to avoid helping the person who is ahead. There is a run for the cards at the end of the game when the engines are built up and players can afford cards, and that is typically how the game ends.

Procedurally a rather simple game, on your turn play a card do what it says. 
The card roles allow you to produce goods in a province or collect money, Move and build, buy/sell goods, buy more cards (roles to choose from), copy last action by another player, finally collect your cards played cards and perhaps get a small bonus and deploy a new builder. The map is important since building after others cost a factor more and the builders can block access to a city site. It is the players order of selection that adds uncertainty not the the draw.

The scoring is the most complicated part but adds a whole layer of complexity. Each card has a god on the bottom. These don't affect game play, but act as multipliers for scoring. So you are looking at not only what the action the card provides but will the god multiplier helps your scoring. Specialization can pay off quite a bit. 

Not a hard game to get started, but you find yourself frequently wondering how to best improve your position in your chosen path.

Concordia is a great game. It's fairly simple, plays in around 90 minutes, but is packed with tense decisions. Games can play out quite differently due to the random setup with various locations being spread across the board and the way the new cards come out. The scoring is also varied enough such that you can really explore many different paths for getting lots of points. The turns are interesting as you can save up for some massive turns by setting up for them. It's a game that clearly rewards good long term planning while also rewarding those players that can be a bit flexible to take advantage of the changes in game state made by the other players. Interaction is there, although that is perhaps one of the weaker parts as for the most part everyone is making their own plans and you won't get too screwed over by what others do--but occasionally you can be and it can make a large difference in the outcome. 

Overall I came away quite impressed by my first play and could see this rising in rating as repeated plays reveal more of the strategic depth I believe to be there.

Megvan a kieg. is, mert ránézésre is kiáltott érte a játék. Jókat lehet benne kombózni és kellemes izgalom töltött el játék közben is. ÉS ez csak a 2 fős játék!!:)
A kis levonás csak annak szól, hogy volt egy kis utánérzésem, hogy láttam már valahol, más köntösben, de ennek ellenére is újdonságnak hatott az egész. Szóval jó választás volt! 
És ráadásul elmagyarázni, elmondani a játékot nem tart tovább, mint 10 perc, ami sokszor igencsak jól jön.

Jan 2017: This game rubbed me the wrong way. Perhaps it might be because of poor play from my first play. This is one of those kinds of games that if you don't plan properly, you can get very stuck and be forced to to may sub-optimal moves to get yourself out of the mess that's all of your fault!

Avoid at 5 players unless all players have sufficient experience with the game; the game moves a bit slowly.

Played it at Essen (a friend bought the very first copy off the pallet) and thought "quite good, probably 7.5/10, but I'd rather play Navegador/Imperial/Antike; besides, I have a room full of 7.5 games which don't get played often enough, so I'm not buying it.  I won't refuse to play if someone else buys, though - and I quite look forward to playing it again."  

Two games played since then, once it arrived in the UK shops and someone else *did* buy it, and my views remain much the same.  Interesting game, quite good, I'll play it again, but it doesn't have anything about it which really grabs *me*.  There are plenty of other, often highly rated, games which I think are quite good when the majority opinion seems to be that they are great, but to my mind Imperial is a deeper experience and Navegador a more interesting one.  So if someone else puts it on the table I'll play it - at least a couple more times - but it's not a game that I'm chomping at the bit to play as often as I can.

Man this game is good! All the elements of this game play so well off each other and I don't have any complaints at all. I love the way they incorporated some light Deck-Building but at the same time found a way to also make it the main source of VP's. Trying to balance having certain actions available to you vs. having a lot of certain coloured cards is a fun challenge. The race to get hold of certain real estate/resources is enjoyable and the push-your-luck aspect of when to grab all the money before everyone else is great. I would have no problem recommending the base game by itself but I also highly recommend the Salsa expansion, and I don't buy expansions.

Concordia is very clever.    Economics engines within engines.   Every turn is spent agonizing over a plethora of incredibly simple yet disastrously difficult decisions, any one of which will make three other players at the table shout "Ah! That changes everything for me!"

Not too difficult to learn or teach, and relatively fast given the intensity of the experience.  There is very little randomness here, but the ramifications of your decisions are mostly opaque.

Concordia is a point salad with some very unique mechanisms. I really appreciate the game, and had a pretty good time. I would definitely be willing to play again with 3 players if no one was AP. The game would be best if it stayed close to an hour game play. While I really respect this game, it would not be one that I would want to add to my collection. And as far as Euro games go, there are several others that I would want to play way before this one. That being said, if someone pulled this one out and really wanted to play, I would be happy to oblige them. I guess what I'm saying is, it's not that this one is bad, but that my Euro collection has already been kind of established and I don't even get to play the one's I love enough to think about adding this one to the rotation.

The more I play it, the more I like it. Seems like a very simple eurogame at first (and the rules ARE simple), but there's so much goodness hidden in the game's dynamics... There's no direct interaction here - or at least no confrontation - but how people play affects everyone around. For starters, you really need to be able to assess the tempo of the game, because card value can change depending on how fast people buy cards from the track. 

But that's just the tip of an iceberg - there are also different dillemas here: build close to others or far away? When to use the Diplomat card? Use Architect often for small profit or maximize his action to build a lot in one turn? So much to think about! Quite an unique game in that regard - deeper than you might think after your first play.

Still, I wouldn't call it a deck-building game, as this element is minor. Sure, you buy cards, but often not to build an efficient deck - rather to get the right scoring cards. I recommend this highly, a game that offers a lot more than it seems after scanning the rules or even playing for the first time. Personal note: works a lot bettter with 4, as a 2-player game it was only decent.

RATING: 6
One of those games that is very well designed but doesn't get me excited about playing multiple times. Too frustrating waiting for your turn! Crazy multipliers too. Bit too many to feel in control of scoring - and it took too long to play. Still, recommended for those who like multiple VPs to victory games.

Finally, don't drink too much coffee before playing. Makes you mega anxious.

Very excellent game of resource acquisition and management, though this is not necessarily what wins you the game.  Simple to explain, and always fun to play, even when losing horribly, because you just don't know until the end, when all scoring takes place.  Ranks near my favorites of all time, and I hope to end up in a nursing home filled with Concordia players.

Fast and easy, with plenty of strategy. I love how you basically build your own custom scoring engine by traveling around the map and collecting multipliers. The player interaction here is minimals but effective, since you want to be the first to build in a location, but not the only one, since you want other players to trigger the resource production of the regions.

A very finely crafted game. I can easily see this rating going up with more plays.

After two plays: I like the options and constraints of this game, but I don't feel that I understand it very well yet. A small amount of setup randomness keeps your sessions varied, but there is no other luck in the game which is a feature I enjoy. My rating might rise after more plays.

Intense game.

It's all about the hidden scoring, which is revealed at the end.  Kinds reminded me of the bonus cards at the end of Stone Age.

Seems it's best to specialize in one area.  In the game I played the winner (who wasn't me), got 7 scoring cards for areas and was able to build in all 12 areas for a 84 points in that one category.

Good healthy tension throughout the game as there is always more you want to do.

Another great Mac Gerdts design. Everything meshes well as usual. The card managing mechanic at the heart of the game works great, the interaction between the players, taking into acount what they play and what they do on the map, all which also can affect you, is also very well accomplished. The only negative is the complete lack of intermediate scoring and the difficulty to know who is where on the score track. But it doesn´t take anything from the game, a great game which I really enjoy to play over and over again!

I love Euro games and this one is yet another that just has all the right things doing all the right things.  Thank you so much for the great brain puzzle!

RATING: 6.5
Another Euro with quite good mechanics but a very dry theme. It is somehow innovative that you build your hand of possible actions that at the same time are your victory point generators. This game is probably very well balanced, since all player were in the same victory point range (max. difference of 10), even though rather different strategies were employed.

I personally do not like the game that much, because I get  turned of by the aspect of time in this game (same is  true for Gerdt's rondell games): I might have much more resource generating cities than others, but every city (actually region) has to be activated to produce. So having less cities which are activated the same number  of times gives you the same output. I rather prefer an automatic economy with a certain output in a certain time frame.

The art work and the map are not really inviting (especially the cover!). Some symbols are  really hard to recognize (price on cards). Why the cards must have a brownish-grey background (bad contrast to text) is probably only known to the graphic designer.

Played twice. Has a lot of interesting elements but really don't like not knowing relative scores. Esp trying to get a handle on what cards (multipliers) that 4 other people are holding is just tedious. 

Update: 9/2017 had to raise my rating from 6.25 to 7.5. Not knowing ongoing scores still not my favorite but have to say this is a great design esp for the simplicity of the rules.

Update: 2/2018 ok now love this game. Just goes to show that some games take several plays to appreciate. 7.5 to 9

I was quite impressed with this on my first play. Set up colonies, generate goods, sell goods, buy goods, etc. The actions you take are limited by cards in your hand and pieces on the board, you can buy more of both. At the end your score is determined by essentially multiplying cards in your hand by pieces on the board so it pays to develop both.
Its not a quick or a light game but it was still possible to pick up the rules very quickly allowing you to get into the game proper.

I'm fairly new to this game, but it's quickly becoming an obsession.

This game gives you quite a bit of freedom, while restricting that freedom just enough. 

It's as if the designer hired a group of psychologists to analyze the most powerful psychological reinforcers in board games. You get the satisfaction of spreading your empire over a map and building it in the way that you choose.You simultaneously feel powerful and rich while never feeling like you quite have enough to do everything you hope to do.

Own the Concordia: Salsa expansion along with the Britannia/Germania and the Gallia/Corsica maps.

Don't judge a book by its cover... This is a fantastic game. I absolutely love the way this plays. It is very stream lines and simple, with so much depth and great decision making. There is so much replayability in the setup and numerous maps (2 base game, plus 2 more in Salsa, and then other inexpensive map expansions on top of that.) That's also a good way to adjust how tight the game will be depending on the board you pick. I've only played it with the salsa expansion, but I don't see why it wouldn't be fantastic without it.

(+) Turns go by smoothly. The play-a-card-perform-an-action adage often attributed to this game rings true. 
(+) There is great depth in the assembly of your pool of cards, and the action selection plan which you set out to do on a sequence of turns. The Diplomat is especially powerful, as it allows you flexibility you would not normally have, letting you leech off of others' more advanced card purchases.
(+) Despite its simple turn structure, this game is rich with strategy. It achieves this without being bogged down with overly convoluted mechanisms.

(-) Lacking in player interaction.
(-) The game feels 'peaceful' or 'thoughtful', and does not ever incite feelings of excitement.
(-) The scoring system is questionable; worried that it is a case of whosoever bought the most cards is the winner. This is likely more prevalent at lower player counts.

Got it for my 35th birthday. This is a cool game. It's a hand builder rather than a deck builder. The difference is you can use all cards in your hand and there is no draw pile, so when you buy a card you just put it in your hand and are able to use it. You're also trying to accomplish goals that your cards give you bonuses for.

i wish i craved to play this game as often as i want to play Power Grid. such a solid game of spreading out with surprisingly little blocking (and no random "take-that" steals, skips, etc). my two minor hold-ups with this game would be a.) i'm a little tired of deckbuilders and that carries over to this game even if it's more of a hand-builder with no shuffling, and b.) missing out on card purchases can be devastating even if you're crushing it on the city-building front (ask my wife!). having said that, wow i enjoy this game! the smaller maps are a great addition, by the way. i look forward to playing through every map i own and roping in non-Pandemic double-date game nights. this is definitely the kind of game i'm thinking of when i imagine downsizing my collection and having only the best of the best (for us) on the shelf.

RATING: 9
Surprisingly simple clear minimalist rules and very interesting gameplay. Planning and execution is important for playing well; there is almost no randomness, except for the relatively minor randomness of the order that later cards come out to be available for purchase via Senator action. Neat tension between building more cities on the board and acquiring cards; you need some of both. I really like the central mechanism of playing one card from your hand for its action, and one of the cards is Tribune to take back all the cards you've played.

We've mostly been playing 2-player on the base game's Italy map and enjoying it a lot.

I see many people say the Salsa expansion improves it; for me, the base game is already very interesting and cool and clever!

The box is a bit oddly large and unusually proportioned. On the other hand, it's similar in length and width to Power Grid, which we own and like very much.

If my wife wanted to own it, I'd happily own it; but as it currently stands we have a friend who loans us his set sometimes. :)

Feels a little bit like a more complex Thurn and Taxis for some reason, where you're deciding what towns you're going to go for and the most efficient way to build them, although mechanically it's totally different.  I really like the variable board set up, where certain resources may be in short supply or concentrated in certain sections on the map, and then they interact with the resource you get when you activate that province (so a resource that is in short supply on the board but is present in the province slots will get activated more often). I kept wishing there were more of the specialist cards in the deck (there's just more of each).  I can see this easily modified with expansions for more variation in the role cards.  I kind of liked how the rules had a beginner rule for intermediate scoring - it has no impact on the game, but rather is just a way for new players to be reminded of how endgame scoring will work.

Concordia is not much to look at based on the box cover and board... but do not let this one pass you by. Players play members of the ancient Roman empire trying to expand their influence in the empire at the same time gaining favor with the Roman gods. Players have a starting deck of cards and players use those cards for actions on the board and players have the option of expanding their deck with more  card purchases. The point values of the items on the board depend on the  number of card types purchased during the game. This game is smooth and fun and a thinker.

Pros: Unique interactive card action play, Multiple ways to gain points. Fun resource management elements.

Cons: no gripping art or design, unnecessarily large box to store, does not scale as well for low player counts (easier)

This is a solid, fun design.  It's true that you are likely to take several actions which help your opponents over the course of the game, and that you'll likewise benefit from what happens on your opponents' turns, sometimes, though admittedly this didn't happen as often as I expected it would after hearing some reviews of the game.  Generally, it is like some other games in that you know your opponents can benefit from many of your potential actions, and so you seek out the action that has a significant benefit to you while avoiding helping your opponents too much.  I enjoy games wherein each turn involves playing an action card, and this game expands on that core mechanic by allowing you to add more cards, and I love the victory mechanism based on deck composition and its relation to several performance metrics.  I look forward to playing the game more.

I had a rocky relationship with this game over the first few plays... but wow did it grow on me.

The only thing keeping it from a 10 for me are the memory tasks. (I have a poor memory and I really don't enjoy feeling pressure to make use of it.)

Playing on http://boiteajeux.net has shown me how vitally important memory is in the game in order to play at a high level (there, the game effectively bestows all players with perfect memory). If an online async version were the game's only implementation I'd rate it a 10, easy. There, the memory tasks are handled for you. It's obvious why this wouldn't work well in a real time game.

Easy to learn and teach, very elegant and intuitive flow of the turns. Very subtile competition without any "cutthroat-ness" thus ideal as family game.  Endgame scoring can be very exciting when the effectivness of different strategies are compared.

RATING: 7
This has a Navegador scoring system with cards written all over it. Lovely wooden bits. The game is screaming for an expansion with a better set of purchasable cards.

The card mechanics and whatnot are interesting enough, but for all the effort that went into the historical ins and outs of the various regions the game never had that much of a Roman feel to it. That's a pity because it feels like more variation within the purchasable cards could have easily added some proper historical feel to the setting. Instead each card is just a production or a minor variation to the starting cards. As purchasable cards reveal themselves you more often than not find yourself buying them for the victory point multiplier, with little thought to the action the card provides. The card mechanic thus finds itself taken over by the points scoring system, which engineers a tight game, but not one that lives up to its potential.

There's a few decent choices to be made on your turn, but they're relatively quick choices between 1-3 cards, so the pace of the game should be quite quick. If it's not then it should be. Turns can usually be planned out well in advance. The game is rather light and shouldn't take much over an hour with experienced players. Happy to play again with experienced players who can keep the pace ticking along.

I have played this game quite a few times and always enjoy it. It's better than Antike in that you can avoid long stalemates at the end of the game, but worse in that it's not so clear what you are trying to do or who is in the lead. Still, my favourite at the moment.

RATING: 8
A hand management game, with some elements of deck building, in which players try to spread their influence all over the map to get resources and all type of benefits. The turn is very simple: Just play an action card and do what it says. There is also the opportunity to purchase more action cards. to The scoring system is very original, since the action cards work also, at the end of the game, as multipliers for the different scoring categories.

The hand management aspect of the cards in Concordia has been compared to that of Lewis and Clark, Rococo, and City of Iron, and as a result I had very high expectations. In this regard there was a bit of a let-down, as I think that all the other mentioned games have more interesting hand management mechanics. Having said that, this is still a game that does everything well, while at the same time not doing anything exceptional. Overall though, I liked it.

RATING: 8
Stop it, designers! Just stop making awesome games. I can't keep up. And if you keep making such wonderful games, I won't be able to play them all.

Concordia works really well, doing some set collection to help with scoring at the end, which also acts as light deck building, which provides the ability for players to become more efficient by building a resource engine and claiming different territory.

The game doesn't have much of a story to it and is pretty dry, which doesn't usually bother me at all, but which I noticed the first couple of plays. But now that I have played it a few more times, that isn't an issue for me at all; the rules just work together so well, and the end-game scoring provides some good anticipation.

(In one specific game, my wife caught me off guard by ending the game early, collecting the 7-point bonus, and winning by only a handful of points. It was a genuinely exciting, dramatic finish.)

My new favorite Mac Gertz game featuring colonization and commerce in the Holy Roman Empire. Play a card to take an action. Play a Tribune to reclaim your played cards. Each card is worth victory points based on the condition of the board. Do you go for more cards, or build more houses and colonists to make your cards worth more VPs? Hint: Probably both. Hard to visualize what your score is or who's winning until the end of the game, but still an interesting game.

Solid eurogame, nothing special but I'd usually be willing to play. A game of working out efficient turns based on a limited selection of actions, with enough depth to allow different strategies. The hand of cards mechanic is neat, the best feature of the game. Despite theoretically short turns it can drag a little as you need to pay attention to opponents' cards and they can inadvertently change your plans forcing a rethink on your turn.

RATING: 9
This game is fantastic. I love the way that the action cards are also end game scoring, and the interplay with building yourself up on the board. I like how there are so many places to compete with the other players, and a ton of interaction without the interaction being negative.

There are competing incentives to build into as many regions as possible so that you can benefit when other players produce and get end game scoring or build up a single region so that it is efficient for you to produce there. 

While I have heard concerns about the Concordia card, I think it works well. It rewards rushing to build houses, and forces players to be a little more thoughtful about reducing the number of cards in the offer to below 3. I've won with and without it.

The expansion maps change things up, but don't fundamentally alter the game.

Salsa adds forum tiles that give you special abilities that can push you in different directions and make you value certain actions differently, which makes the game more strategically diverse. It also adds salt, which is a wildcard resource. I think both are great additions, but the implementation of salt city scoring can be problematic. Salt cities can be scored for one Minerva card, which allows the Weaver and to a lesser extent the Vintner to become incredibly efficient. Scoring 30 points off of the Weaver is pretty common when playing with salt, and I can't help thinking that salt cities should be slightly cheaper and not score for Minerva cards at all.

First play fell a bit flat for Mel. I enjoyed it but it wasn't as tense as I was hoping. While the mechanics are very simple, I think it might take a few plays to fully grasp the strategy, which will help in making the decisions seem more important. Also, I've heard with two players the Italia map is not the best, so that could have contributed as well.

Update: played this with 5 players twice now (on the Imperial map) and it was definitely a lot more fun and strategic. I think getting a good 2-player map would help with that experience. Right now I'd be willing to play this any time with a group.

Thoughts after first play:  

I like this game a lot, as I suspected I would.  It's deep and fun and cognitively challenging.  But, it is nothing near a gateway game.  No one claims it is, but the simple rule set may deceive you.  Heavy processing required.  And that's primarily because of the complex scoring system.  It's too bad the scoring is so opaque (on first play).  But I cannot fault the game, because it begs you to replay and become an expert.  A game I want to play more.  

First play with 4 players took over 3 hrs (including rules explanation).  Longer than I expected, in part because people didn't understand value of buying cards enough.

Spread Sheet Victory Point Matrix the Game. 

I really wonder what happened to Gerdts. Imperial is a true classics, the new ones were just euro puzzles with a rondel. And now he is here - same thing with no rondel. More or less MPS game with some leeching (yay!) and "soft blocking" (you have to pay more!). The key is building your deck of actions - it works kinda similar to Havana (having a special action to take discard back to your hand).  

Graphics are hard to read and pretty generic. The game is about optimising your way through the spread sheet with some luck and randomness included as is in fashion these days. Both Brügge and Ginkopolis are better versions of card play with the board.

Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired AND themeless AND tedious looking (beige overkill). Too pedestrian.

Played once with the Salsa expansion with 5P. Concordia further refines the concept where players play through a personal deck, and are required to refresh their deck every now and then. The Diplomat, which allows players to copy an opponent's card, adds an interesting tweak to player dynamics.

The mechanisms are well integrated here. Players expand production in a Power Grid-esque format, generating resources for cash and cards, which in turn assist in expanding production further. Cards also serve as endgame multipliers, so players need to know when to begin pushing for endgame scoring.

I do have an issue with the cardplay; it seems fairly important to keep track of what opponents have played and have in their hand. This for the purpose of optimising the use of the Diplomat and to know what opponents' are gunning for in endgame scoring, among other things. But this is fairly difficult to do in a 5P game which lasts potentially over 2 hours.

This is currently my favorite game maybe? This game is so rich with decision and strategy, yet technically its probably the simplest game I own. You literally play a card and do what it says on your turn. thats it. those cards determine what areas your control, what resources you can manage and trade. the end scoring really provides a moment of tension cause you never know who is the winner until the results are tallied.

Great game with three, or even four if everyone is playing at the same rate. Lovely combo of card management and area-sort-of-control.

Played a game, and bought it.

I'm usually not much into area control, but I rather like this game. There is no single strategy or type of resource that is absolutely necessary to win the game; The best strategy appears to often be one that nobody else is going for.

I think we underrated the importance of buying extra hand cards, which are at the same time the only source of converting stuff on the board into victory points -- not to mention that they allow you to do more actions before having to spend an action on getting the played cards back.

What of course is always a big plus for a game is that there is very little randomness.

In short, I'm rather fond of this game, and it absolutely lived up to the expectations in the second round that we played back at home.

Mac Gerdts best game to date. He takes the rondel mechanism and transforms it into a personalised experience with a deck of cards. Where you personally decides witch actions to take and in what order. To add to that you expand your deck with the actions you desire and the type of victory points you want to score in the end.

Pakliépítős, szerepválasztós játék a Concordia. Térképen haladunk szárazföldön és vízen, közben termelő helyeket építünk. Termelünk, pénzt szerzünk, kereskedünk és a játék végén a kártyáink színének megfelelően pontozunk le egyes dolgokat. Felépített termelőhelyek, különböző termelőhelyek, emberek száma, stb.
Kimondottan tetszett, hogy nincs harc a játékban, igazából csak lapvásárlással lehet a másiknak keresztbe tenni, de ez abszolút nem vészes. Mindenből van pont. Gyors is a játék, de elsőre persze elég homályban tapogatózik a játékos, mert nem tudja mire menjen. Jó játék a Concordia, de nem éreztem igazán kiemelkedőnek. Kellene vele még játszani.

In the right group this flows very natural and smooth keeping everyone 100% connected to the game for the whole length. I love the design with the perfect amount of tokens and cards, the right player board size and fits perfect on my table which is a very important aspect :)
0 luck factor, you do exactly what you want to do, you're pretty much never forced to do some specific action, but you have to plan 1-2-3-6 turns ahead every move.
Very easy to teach, very easy to keep track of everything that happens on the board, a must own for everyone liking light-mid heavy euros. Works perfect as a gateway game.

Elegant gameplay but with some depth (that I have yet to fully explore). Each turn you play one card and do what it says, easy! However, planning your moves so as to be efficient is tricky. It's not directly confrontational but you really have to be aware of what the other players are up to. Seems to work well 2 player. I have a feeling experienced players will slaughter beginners, so perhaps not the best game for your non gamer types, even if the rules aren't too heavy. Also bad for the AP prone (maximizing victory points could be killer).
-- Just picked up Concordia Salsa. Not exactly a must have--the base game is quite nice without it--but after our first game with it, I can't imagine playing without it (except maybe to teach beginners).

Outstanding game. The ruleset is actually pretty simple, and it's really cool how the set of cities that you take over ends up that they make your actions more powerful, just as the cards that you collect influence your endgame score. A really elegant game where everything comes together nicely. Our first play went quite long because we were really distracted, but I'm looking forward to future plays of this.

As someone who respects Euros, but does not necessarily love them, know that Concordia is still my all-time favorite of the genre. Brilliant design with complex strategy and player interaction that is more interesting than most other Euros (especially older ones). 

If you are a fan of the genre, and honestly even if you aren't, given Concordia a try! It takes a special game to stand out in the sea of Euros that exists in 2018, but this game does, and will remain an all-time classic alongside Puerto Rico, Agricola, and other more modern stars.

1 play, 3er

This is an economic, card-management game, this time without a rondel! Card handling is sort of like Rococo: everyone starts with the same mix, but can acquire more by buying from a card row. Here, though, you can pick up your discard pile any time, by using the right action card. Cards allow you to do different actions, like moving pieces on the board, building settlements, collecting resources, etc. 

There's an interesting type of timing thing: you want to be able to work with the pace others are, to take advantage of producing at the right time so you can sell at the right time. You also want to delay taking the income action, so you get more money; but don't wait so long that someone else gets it! You want to expand early, to claim key territory; but the longer you wait (to collect the necessary resources), the more you'll be able to expand at once. 

Also interesting is the end-game VP awards, which are based on the cards you've collected during the game. Cards are associated with one of the gods; each god scores VP a different way, with each card being a multiplier, e.g. (# cards) x (# brick settlements you have). So you're balancing end-game VP awards with in-game card action powers.

Cool game, although maybe not the best with 3: too much board space.

Very simple rules in a deph game with tons of strategy. It has a deck building mechanic that sometimes seems like an improved rondel. It plays good with any number of players and, if you choose the right map, you will have lots of interaction. What a brilliant game!

This was my first Mac Gerdts game.  From what I know of him the rondel is his bread and butter and this is one of only a couple games without a rondel.  Instead this is a trading game predicated on deck-building and action card selection.

The game starts with each player controlling a sea and land colonist on a map of southern Europe/northern Africa and a hand of the same action cards.  Each turn is simply a player playing one of these action cards.  However there are a lot of decisions and a lot of strategy behind those action cards.

The actions you can take with these cards include moving your colonists and establishing new colonies.  Generating goods which are used to build colonies, colonists, and buy more action cards for your deck.  Buying and selling goods.  And buying new cards for your deck.  The last two cards are the neatest ones.  One of them copies the last played card of your opponent, the other takes back all your cards so you can play them again.  Knowing when to play these two cards are a couple of the most interesting decisions in the game.

The scoring mechanic in this game is a really neat and original one.  Each of the cards in your deck, both starting and bought throughout the game, have a Roman god's name printed on them.  Each god scores points at game end for different things like amount of money, number of colonists, etc. and you score those points a number of times equal to the number of cards for that god you have.

I will say that I don't think this game is that fantastic with just two.  With just two we tended to split off and work just in our own corners of the map with very little interaction.  This devolved the game into a very solitaire experience where we were really only competing for the new action cards and otherwise just did our own thing and compared scores at the end.

There also isn't a huge variety of different cards so I am afraid even with more players and more interaction you'll have "been there, done that" after a number of plays and it will just start to feel same-y and kind of uninteresting.  It's still a very clever and interesting game, I just don't think it is going to withstand a lot of play.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting hand management euro game. The theme is over done, but the mechanics is what made this game shine! I really liked the card play in this game. Each card has an  one of the game's actions on it, and then there are two additional cards, one for copying another player's card and one to pick up your discard pile. You could buy additional cards to expand your hand. These cards where similar to the cards you already had (sometimes more powerful), but since each card is a multiplier for end game scoring, it made for interesting decisions. I did find it sometimes difficult to figure out how well I was doing, but maybe I just need to play it more. Also I found that this game scales well thanks to the two-sided board.

Gameplay is very fluid and fast. Short turns with few rules to think about. The game is simple to get into and it engages all players very well, all the time. The circuit production, trade, buy is very well designed, especially because of the production mechanism, which simplifies the rules complicating the decision.
With some aspects changed this game could easilly be one of the best Games for 2013!

Too early to rate, but a first game that allowed me to see how elegant the system is. It reminds me a bit of Power Grid, but  PG was not as smooth.
Looking ahead to more plays. If the strategy starts to become a little more obvious with repeated plays, it will be fantastic. Only worry at this point is that VP come from many sources and at this point, the final scoring felt entirely open: I had no idea I would come into 3rd place (out of 3), Io actually felt like I was winning. It was very hard to keep track of scoring with every player keeping their hand secret. We will see.

The individual actions you take in the early rounds of Concordia are so small they sometimes feel almost inconsequential.

The game is a strategic avalanche.

The ugliest box cover to don a top 100 geek game? Because it will make top 100' possibly top 20. A natural and lovely progression from  the rondel to a quasi deck builder. The scoring feels like Navegador but integrates into actions selections as every card provides points as well as actions. It's not quite a deck builder as you don't havea random card draw - you re always in control of what cards you have to play. Simple rules but loads of options - ultimately tricking a balance between the engine and the VP. Need to explore more and I expect familiarity will led to more focused strategies and a little bit of counter drafting. One of the best games I have played from Essen 13 and proof tht there is still life in the middle weight Euro

The card action mechanic is quite like using the rondel at the start of the game as you can not select the same action till the cards come around again. Where it changes (and becomes more interesting) is in purchasing new actions. As its not really a deck builder in the random draw from a deck is not there is no no down side (other than opportunity cot of resources and actions) to filling your deck.
 

2nd play not so keen. A disguised point salad? With a lot of min max. Poor heuristics. V difficult to see how others are doing. 


3rd play heuristics better and enjoyed more.

Wow! What an amazing game!  One of my Favourites!

So Simple and Elegant, easy to teach, yet strategic and a game with some depth!

Love games with area control alongside variable card abilities and variable setups.  Each time you play the board resource setup will be different and the draw of all the initial abilities coming up in the market area will flow differently. So much fun!

The perfect weight for me.  Strategic, but not a brain burner, yet no AP issues.  

Looking forward to trying the Britannia board which is supposedly better suited for 2 players as it's a tighter board.

Mostly played 2-3 player games. Could run long with 4 to 5? Not sure.  May not with experienced players at the table.

What a fantastic strategy game!  It is so satisfying to have a string of several innocuous turns suddenly burst into a chain reaction that lets you build more, buy more and score more than anyone else around the table thought possible.  And there are no dice!  I've noticed that this game plays slowly with certain people... don't let a sour experience with one group spoil this one for you; try it with some different friends!

It's really streamlined considering what you can do and the wanted depth of the game.

The scoring is what gets me. I can see the genius of it, but in actual play it's really opaque. You make tactical choice thinking of a grand strategy that you might not be able to pull off.  This will give you cards with little use and you will only be able to get more if other players allow you.

This would be more interesting if it was real deck builder instead of a hand management game.  Limited hand choice might make for more heartbreaking choices and interesting play.

Each turn a player uses an action cards, which also functions as a Navegador-like scoring multiplier -- e.g., Architect cards allow building of cities; each such card in a player's deck at the end of the game is worth 1 VP per non-brick city. Other actions include producing goods in regions (1VP per region a player has a presence in), buying/selling goods (2VP per type of goods produced), acquiring colonists (2VP per colonist), purchasing new cards etc. 

It works well enough -- expand, buy cards, balance acquisition of scoring multipliers with doing of actual stuff. If not quite multiplayer solitaire, it does manage to be even less interactive than Navegador (the left-right binding issue in that game handily resolved by making you not care what anyone else is doing at all!). The card system is so under-utilized -- it needs an expansion with some more interesting cards! -- that it hardly seems like an improvement from the rondel.

Smooth but bland. Great components and presentation other than the hideous box cover.

After one play, not sure where I land on this one. I like the way the cards work, and how you build presence on the map. But I don't really understand why the Mars/Jupiter etc type scoring at the end counts for so much since there isn't anything anyone can do to counter it if they even remember what other players are collecting.  

The game is very unforgiving to players (like me) that don't move enough on the board in the beginning and get behind in the resources they need to do other things. So I would like to play again to fix my initial play mistakes. Score could really go up to a 7 or 8 or down to a 5.

I played this 5 times (with all different player numbers) already and enjoyed it every time. The signature of the designer for me is not the action wheel, but the fact that there's some way your actions are offered, without being too restricting. In that way he brings a quick flow to a game, without losing the strategic appeal, on the contrary. I have tried some different paths to victory and it stays interesting. All actions have their strength, all actions feel rewarding (almost in a "settlers-way"), interaction is there and the scoring system is an act of genius. 
When I can add to this that the (clearly presented) rules only take 4 pages, I can conclude with "top game".

Yes! This game is quite good and I expect my rating could rise with future plays. There is quite a bit going on, but during the rules explanation I never felt myself getting lost or hazy. A full-figured and clean system.

Despite my warm fuzzies, the thing that really sold me on this game was that it has a board for 2-3 players, and another board for 4-5 players. Having a heavy game work for two players is an absolute MUST for me these days.

Upgraded 5/10/15

Downgraded to a 7.

The game is still enjoyable, but it's hard to know what your score is, or where you stand, during the game. In my last game I was kind of winging it, and it felt like a couple other players were having MUCH better turns than I was. Then I ended up winning. It was completely shocking.  Made it feel kind of ... random ... after 2+ hours of play.

Concordia has a simple ruleset that leads to a nice amount of think during playing.  The single card action keeps you from going into total AP mode.  Sometimes I smack myself for not maximizing each move but, hey, it is what it is.  The length is good (at least with 2 players) and the components are classic Euro.  I like the art and graphic design.  It reads well and looks like an old boring map.  I dig that.  

I feel that the battle for Saturn is crucial in the two player.  It's been the decider in almost all of our games. 

Fantastic replay ability. 

You know, it kind of reminds me of China a bit.  Simple, sparse and very re-playable.  Except this one plays well with 2.   I'm very excited about the release of the Britannia map.

update:  This game has passed the test for 2 player gaming goodness.  There's enough going on that it doesn't feel like a race.  I have been able to compete with Saturn if my opponent goes for that.

Also expansion:
Britannia - Excellent addition for the 2 player space.
Salsa - Very god expansion and probably the best 2 player map.

I haven't played all of Mac Gerdts games, but all of the ones I have played I have very much enjoyed. So this is a game that I was very much looking forward to trying. It having only 4 pages of rules was quite a surprise. And 2 of those 4 pages are the explanations of what the cards do. In fact, the rules go like this: on your turn play one card and do what it says. That's it. Of course the devil is in the details. How do the actions on the cards interact with each other? What strategies emerge from those actions? And what emerges is a very strategic resource gathering, city building, hand building (not really deck building, because you get to choose from your whole deck) game that is so simple in rules yet quite complex to figure out how to play. Especially the first few turns. All of us just tried some stuff. One player started buying cards only to figure out she needed the resources to build cities to get more resources. She recovered though and scored well (but not well enough, haha!). After about 75% of the game I was comfortable enough with the way the game played to start worrying about the score. So I took a look at my deck and figured out what I could do maximize my score, starting from where I was at that point.
I was very pleasantly surprised by the depth and different strategies the game offers with such simple rules. The fact that I won, might have helped, but while I had a good feeling about the outcome, I thought some other people where in the running as well, yet it felt very good. Looking forward to the next session!

Concordia is clearly very nicely put together with lots of integrated little bits moving nicely along. Alas, I don't actually enjoy playing it, in much the same way that I could appreciate Navegador, but never had fun with it.

I dislike the sliding cost of cards, especially with five players as the card that is 'vital' for what you're doing can easily appear and be bought before you have a chance to take a turn. I dislike the way that you can benefit from others but they can simply refuse to co-operate and all that happens is that you lose out (i.e. both having houses in a region and the player with the majority there never Prefects it). I suspect a lot of these concerns are because I'm bad at the game, but I don't care for it enough to keep playing it to dig deeper.

Drier than Death Valley in July, this game is themeless set of (very well-designed) game mechanics humming along at peak efficiency. 

The role selection system is so buttery smooth, you could spread it on your breakfast toast.

However, it lacks anything resembling tension or flavor. The game is like a rice cake. Beyond the core card-playing mechanic, it's a resource-conversion engine-building game stripped of any functionally identifiable characteristics: Take wooden bits, turn them into other wooden bits, and turn those other wooden bits into points. 

But put that card-based role system into a game with some spice, and then we're getting somewhere.

Easy rules, but not so easy game.

Interesting deckbuilding. The most cards that you buy are the basic cards, but you want tchem, because you don`t want to waste your action for picking up your cards. The second reason is all cards will give you points at the end of the game for different things.

The only question for me is how high is the replayibility? The cards are easy, maybe to easy. I miss a second deck with more tricky cards. The cities are random, but will it change something in gameplay? It seems every game could look very similar.

The growth and deck-building don't give the feeling of development I was expecting. Seems like a game of accumulating small efficiencies where nothing dramatic can be expected once you reach a certain level of competency. Involves constraint solving / mental linear programming w/ multiple resources which I typically don't enjoy.

A set collection game, I suppose. Like many games, a beginner has to deal with a fog of special action cards to get to a fog of many ways to earn VPs. The card fog is mitigated by few cards being present and affordable. The VP fog isn't too complex, but I have no idea if the game is balanced.

Tried, not bad but I was not impressed. I can see why it's popular: it's like a compilation of many nice aspects we've seen in German games in the last 20 years. It will remind you of Power Grid, Puerto Rico, even Citadels and Through the Ages or Agricola. There is even a little bit of deck building.
Overall, a nice and decent game that "works" perfectly, but somehow it felt really dry. I might change my opinion after a few games but as of now I am not that sure I'll play it again soon.

Simple to explain and good-looking, once you can get past the box art. I wonder if there's an actual game with the theme "resource trading in the uncanny valley". Hmmmmm.

There's lots to do in this game and quite a few ways to go about it, though they all come down to managing resources and building houses. But the fact that there's so many options keeps things fresh, and players can definitely interfere with each other without it feeling like a personal attack.

Nice medium euro - I like Mac Gerdts' designs, but there is no rondel to be found this time around (see what I did there?). What there is is a good euro with a variable setup, interesting choices, multiple ways to win and tons of player interactions. Its mostly a tactical game (at least in that you can't pick a strategy until you get going) and you really want to play off the other players choices a good amount.

RATING: 6
Really lovely game with echoes of [thing=19600]Antike[/thing] minus the direct conflict ([thing=66589]Navegador[/thing] is probably the better comparison, but whatever). Concordia is streamlined and tense. It neatly converts the rondel mechanic into a deck-building style mechanic, and asks the players when they'd like to reshuffle their deck. If you wait, you get a bigger bonus, but sacrifice some of the actions you really want to take. If you reshuffle early, you get the cards you want, but forgo a serious bonus. Combine that with the feeling of expanding your influence over the board and you get a game that I can enjoy!

My big (but only) complaint is the scoring system, which is frustratingly opaque, especially for new players. Buying cards gets you special abilities, but also scores you points -- sort of. The cards actually multiply the points you earn, but do so in a way that feels less obvious than it could be. What I want is a system that forces me to choose between cards that allow me to do a lot in the game, but potentially score less points, and cards that score a lot of points, but do less during the game. There is some of that in Concordia, but also a lot of overlap that muddies the decision space. For experienced players, this is no problem, but for everyone else (including the casual player), the learning curve is steep. Unfortunately, I'm not sure the learning curve is worth the effort. Time will tell. The game is enjoyable, and I look forward to playing more. I only wish I could play more than occasionally. As is, this same complaint keeps rearing its head, which pushes my rating down slightly.

The truth is I enjoy playing Concordia, but when it comes time to score, I feel as though the rug has been pulled out from underneath me. The big reveal at the end of the game always makes me feel as though someone was withholding important information (or like I've been tricked). On a similar note, I wish the game had better player interaction. Taking cards and placing cities others may want gives the impression of direct conflict, but it's really not. It's just too friendly! 

I did have to laugh about the theme. It's literally just trading in the Mediterranean -- difficult to get more cliched than that. Granted, this is actually a positive for me (I love trade-route games!), but don't expect a game dripping with thematic nuance.

Concordia has gotten a lot of buzz on BGG, so I was happy to get a chance to try it.  Concordia is all about card play and it's done in a way I haven't seen before.  Everyone starts with a hand of cards, then you take turns playing a card from your hand to do an action.  The cards also serve as victory points, with each card providing points for different criteria.  Later on you buy more cards which shape your strategy by determining both your available actions and your criteria for victory points.

The card play was very cool, although I didn't feel like I was close to grasping the strategy.  Beyond that, though, you are just trading goods for money and/or VPs with relatively low interaction.  Downtime could be a problem with higher player counts, but it didn't bother me much at 4 players because I was always thinking about my move.  As themeless euros go, this is a good game and I can understand the hype.  But I wouldn't be surprised if I never played it again.

Very good game. Pretty exciting in the end phase. We like this game very much.

+ Rules are 4 pages only, with explanation boxes. Impressive!
+ The downtime is really short usually. And you have to look what your opponent does.
+ Some people don't like the style/look of the game, I love it (exept the cover :)). Really atmospheric in my opinion.

Concordia is big and meaty, and seems to have a well-polished game engine. Nevertheless, I was never really engaged when playing this, and everything felt a little flat and dry.

I really like the hand management and deck building aspects of this game.  There is also some interaction between players in that other players' actions can produce resources for you, and you have cards that let you copy the last card that other players have played.  That made it feel more fun than a pure Euro resource management game.

RATING: 7
A game with a deckbuilding element that has (almost) perfect information. What I mean is that you get the cards you aquire in the course of the game directly into your hand and once you choose a specific action you get all cards played back into your deck to chose from. So there's no shuffling and hoping to draw the right card or the right combo of cards. Also, there's quite a nice twist since every card purchased for your "deck" will be a part of your victory point engine in the end. 

----------------------------------
Slightly downgrading it since it is really hard to keep track of how good or bad your opponents are doing. Most of the time people are focussed on their "puzzle" without any interaction taking place. At least no interaction that could be credited to the games mechanics. I still like the different deckbuilding approach and the nice touch of the final scoring according to how you build your deck with every card of your deck providing victory points.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Excellent game. There is almost no conflict, but there is definite interaction in the form of competition for drafted cards, building in cities, and a unique production mechanic where you make entire areas produce goods, so you often end up giving resources to your opponents while getting things for yourself. Timing is also very important because you want to take actions in the right order, but you're also usually waiting for your opponents to play the right cards so you can copy it.

Update: Oh the expansion. The expansion is perfect in every way and pushed this from a 9 to a 10. My only complaint about the game was that it can be a little too hard to do what you want to do sometimes (for example, it can take several turns to get the right resources because of the way the different actions work). The expansion helps make things [i]slightly[/i] easier while still maintaining a tight game.

The first thing is the salt itself. It counts as a wild good, and everybody starts with one salt, so it gives you much more flexibility early on. After that, it can be pretty tough to get salt so you have to use it wisely.

The next thing is the forum tiles. These can give you a small boost throughout the game (like gaining extra money every time you sell goods) or they can be one-time use tiles that can help you take a super-turn.

The last thing is the new board, which is double-sided. If you didn't buy the map-only expansion, then this is a good way to get more variety outside of the base game boards.

So we have two new things (salt and forum tiles) that add very little complexity to the game but help give it an overall better feel, plus new boards just for variety. Excellent expansion.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
With 2 players there isn't enough competition (though I haven't tried the smallest map, which appears to be specifically for 2 players) and the diplomat cards become really restrictive. Although the game plays fine with 5 players, there can be quite a bit of downtime. With 3-4 players you get a good mix of competition, useful diplomat actions, plus downtime isn't too bad.

RATING: 7.7
Solid, medium-weight euro with what feels like a large number of meaningful decisions and viable strategies. The variability in board setup forces you to re-evaluate your strategy every game. It doesn't feel like there's any one "best" strategy. Player interactions are plentiful as well, giving the game a tactical feel without feeling frustrating. Getting blocked outright rarely happens, limiting the number of meaningless turns you'll experience in the game.
The mechanics are well designed, elegant, and finely tuned, however, I found myself wishing for a for maybe just a few more unique personality cards. Towards the end, I found myself just buying cards to increase multipliers, not because I actually wanted the actions. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and the cards' dual purpose is clever and elegant, but the actions (especially the "advanced" actions that you buy) are maybe just a bit too direct. 

Overall, I feel like it's a very solid game. I'd rank it just above most other euros of its weight class (Istanbul, Five Tribes, etc). If you're looking for something that's easy to teach, flows well, and feels satisfying to play I'd definitely recommend it. However, it's not going to replace heavier games with deep, fiddly puzzles like Caverna/Agricola, or A Feast For Odin, Terra Mystica, etc.

This is a great euro game. I like a lot the management mechanics; it is very easy to grasp yet feels quite complex to play (not in a bad way) because you are often trying to come up with the perfect turn at the right time and you don't always succeed. You are also very attentive of what others do to the board because it could change your whole turn, and overall it feels smooth, very replayable and highly entertaining. There is some downtime between turns and I have to play it more to see how it evolves with time but as of now... one of my favourites in my shelf!

First impression is that this game is great. We had no idea how the end game scoring worked, so our first game was all over the place because no one knew how to support their strategy until most of the way through the game. The rulebook for this game is terrible, but if you can make it through its quite an interesting little game. Reminds me of power grid and settlers without some of the annoying calculations. I like that the actions available are limited, it definitely helps cut down on AP.

I envision many plays of Concordia in our group's future.

The variable setup of the game and multiple board options should ensure no two games are ever the same. You're engaged the entire game as your opponent's moves will either impact your turn negatively (building in a town you were set to move to) or positively (moving a market card toward a cheaper spot or playing a card whose action you'd like to duplicate.

The card-based action structure really cuts down on AP and as soon as all players understand what each card can do the game really picks up steam.

This title is worth of its lofty rating.

I really like this game even though the theme can seem dry (another trading in the Mediterranean game!?).

Concordia is a deckbuilder where you never have to thin your deck, that's also a boardgame.  Every turn you play a card to take an action.  Any cards you haven't yet played are available to you, and whenever you want to retrieve your played cards, there's a card that let's you do that.  Additionally, every card potentially contributes to your score, as all cards have some sort of victory point condition.  If you meet the condition, you get the points on the card.  If you have five cards of the same type, you get the points for every card.  

You're racing your "colonists" around the board to build trading houses in different cities in various provinces.  Each city produces a different good.  Your trading houses can provide the appropriate good when that province is triggered.  Goods help you build trading houses and colonists.  And there is a card row where you can buy new cards from, the newer cards cost more.  At the end of the game you get points from money (marginally), and depending on what cards you have, colonists and trading houses in a) different cities, b) different provinces, c) different types of goods, d) one of the five specific types of good.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=124361][/thing] is a Mac Gerdts' game, the lord of the rondel, whose fame comes from titles like [thing=66589][/thing] and [thing=24181][/thing]. In the game, each player represents a family, a dinasty of romans that expands the borders of the Empire. Each player starts with the same deck of cards, and each of these has a different use - the Merchant allows to gain money and trade goods for other goods; the Prefect activates one region and it produces the main product there for the player that used the action, and also each building built there also produce, but then to the players that own them - the player can also use the Prefect to reactivate all the regions there are in the activated state, gaining money as indicated in them; the Architect allows the players to move ships and colonist, and also to build buildings ins places connected with them; the Diplomat allows the player to copy the last card used by another player; and there are other cards with other functions.

In her turn the player picks one of the cards to use, and put it on the table, and the card stays there. The player do the action allowed by the card, and done, next player turn. Through the cards all the actions in the card, even buy more cards.

Because on the board, besides regions and type of buildings, there is also a row of cards: the ones closer to the front of the row are cheaper to buy, the further it is, the costier it is to buy them, and this is coupled with the unique cost that each card has - so the player pays this unique cost plus the cost accordingly to the place in which the card is. Once bought, the card or cards come into the player hand, and these new cards mostly do the same action the starting ones do, some just a little better, only a few (I think only the Minerva ones) do something completely new, which is activate all the types you have of one type of building (the one connected with the card). Mostly these cards, as actions go, will only allow to do more of something you already could do. This is important, because, since the cards used stay in the board, you can only do the same action again (except the Prefect, since you start with 2 cards of it), once you use the Tribune, to collect all the cards back into your hands. So, with more cards, you can use more actions before using the Tribune (and the Tribunes pays more, since you gain 1 money for every card above three you collect).

And, besides this, not only is important what the card to as action, but also (or even mainly), to which god it is connected, since this will translate into points in the game end. So, the more cards you have, more points. And the more you have of one type of god, more points you will receive in the area the god punctuate. So let's say Mercury give 2 points for every different type of building you have. If you have 4 different types by the game end, every Mercury card will net you 8 points. So, if you have 4 of them, you will gain 32 points (4 x 2 x 4). And this apply to every god. Therefore, not only you have to prepare well in the board (expanding, building, collecting resources), but also you must be aware of the cards there are in the row, trying to not let some great action/scoring card pass you by. And this creates a fine tension, since you mostly wants to leave the cards drops in cost, to pay less for them, but this is somewhat dangerous, since the player to your left can buy 2, the next one 1 or 2, and the cards in your turn were costly, for the third player, are now cheap - will she get them? Shouldn't you just buy the cards, even if overpaying? Tough to say.

Well, [thing=124361][/thing] is a medium level complex game, not too heavy nor overly simple, giving the players a series of options each turn, usually with several of them being good, but you always vying for the best one, since there is a component of timming to the actions being made - like, if you want a card the demands wine to be paid, and no player has wine, and you do, you know you can take your time - any other player will first have to use an action to acquire wine, and since only one action can be made each turn, if one player do this, in your turn, you can buy the card (however, this go both ways: if you want a card, and don't have wine, and someone else has, you might be one step behind, and must hope the other player don't want, didn't notice the card or simply has a better action to do in that moment.

[thing=124361][/thing] is a pretty interesting game, but play smart: there is no catch up mechanism, nor even bash the leader type of action (there is no combat, the best players can do is build first, buy cards the other wants or avoid activating a region where other players have buildings). In my first play, in my very first turn, I bought 2 cards, and, without resources to build, I lagged behind the whole game! Be careful while spending.

Didn't mind the game but the scoring was a little wonky – the last few turns all I did was buy up every card I could and ended up scoring a far amount better than others who's play seemed much better 'cept for the cards I hoarded

RATING: 9.5
This is an absolutely brilliant euro-game. The setup is straight-forward and the rules are really elegant (just 4 pages of rules and 1 setup card!), a turn consists of simply playing one card from one's hand.  

It has elements of an area control game with card drafting and hand management. Lots of variety and decisions to ensure every game is different. 90 minutes is longer than we'd normally enjoy but the game maintains a good pace and it's often your turn before you know it. 

Look forward to playing many more games and then there are the expansions :)

Your first game will be overwhelming, with almost too many options and a scoring system that you won't fully comprehend until the end of the game. On repeat plays, knowing how the game will score, you are able to mentally cull the options you have to target those that will lead you toward your decided goal. The game rewards deciding what you want to do early and then executing your plan. Buying cards for points reminds me of Stone Age. In both games, the early game is dedicated to building up a system that can generate resources and then slowly the game tips toward a rush to secure points. An all around rich and enjoyable experience.

Played prototype at stahleck 2012 with the author.
If you like his other games you'll like this one too, although the theme is not that special. 
It has some deck building in it: 
Starting with a set of 7 cards = 7 actions you'll buy more cards giving you more action and more multiplicators for victory points.

A real masterpiece.
Unlike typical eurogame experience, there is a strong, well balanced and magistally mixed direct/indirect interaction between players.
Deck building (action + goal at the same time) is elegant and functional.
A lot of effect of your action have a strong indirect impact on opponent strategies therefore there is a continous focus also off-turn.
Downtime is reduced to the minimum, since the turn choiche is essential but meaningfull.

I don't hate this game. And I respect it a fair amount (more than I enjoy it, at least). But like many Mac Gerdts games, it's just so dry and calculating that I have a hard time wringing the fun out of it (and this coming from someone who enjoys Power Grid).

My experience with this game is identical to Shut Up and Sit Down's review. The combination of the name, box, and components never appealed to me. It looks so bland like every other eurogame with a one-word title and picture of someone on the front cover.

The gameplay though made up for it. It's a simple game to learn, and there's tons of interesting decisions to make on your turn. At this point I would definitely play it again and also wonder how replayable it will be.

Initial impressions: Concordia is beloved by many. You'd expect a game like Concordia to have lot of fiddly bits and many obscure rules. Yet, I believe the game is a hit primarily because it is simple to teach but has a fair amount of depth. On each turn, players play a card and do the actions on each card. The actions are relatively straight forward and even as you increase the size of the deck, most of the actions are variants of the original set of 7. The game does have a point-salad like quality as there are many areas for scoring and a score pad is required to tabulate the scores. While it feels like there are unique paths to victory, specialization is probably helpful but diversification is just as important as I don't think one route of scoring is sufficient. 

The game does have lots of "conflict" and player interaction is quite high as players jostle to position their houses in cities. This can lead to lots of angst and player frustration as resources are ever so limited.  So while turns in Concordia are relatively quick, it can get bogged down occasionally with AP as there are a fair amount of things to do and you fall in to the "there are 10 things you want to do but not enough rounds" dilemma. 

If there is one criticism of Concordia, it is that the game hinges entirely on accumulating scoring cards for end game scoring. All elements on the board are scored based on the type of cards collected for scoring. There is a balance between collecting scoring cards and advancing your position on the board. At some point, there is a switch in the game as players rush to collect score cards. The switch can be abrupt and the end game can be unexpected. More importantly, this can be frustrating for some players who enjoy tableau building and engine building where 
there is less conflict. Imagine your best plans to score laid to waste when the score cards you want are quickly scooped up by others, sometimes inadvertently because it just happens to be available for other to score a couple of points. That can be vexing. 

Overall, this is a good game and perhaps even a great game. I consider this one of Mac Gerdts's best design  alongside Princes of Macchu Picchu. PErhaps the rondel is just not for me as much as both these designs do not have a giant wheel to move around.

RATING: 8
OK, Fine! Concordia is a good game. Maybe even a great game. While I was at first unimpressed by it's friction-less surfaces, I eventually came to enjoy the rondel-in-a-deck-of-cards outlook and a board that allowed for some nasty (but also very polite) elbowing of the other players.

On it's own, it's fine, but the expansion maps and Salsa really help lengthen the design.

One play, 2p, Italia. At the beginning I didn't have much clue what to do, but after the first scoring round (after which the markers return to zero) it clicked and I started focusing on the cards. Points make you win the game, the rest is a way to get them.

After second game: i did much better but unwillingly crushed my opponent. Now I'm a bit afraid she's done with the game. By the way, I take this turn by turn, very tactical, simply counting what move makes most points.

This is a pretty standard euro with a lot of resource management and strategizing for end-game bonuses.  The main benefit of this game is that it's mechanically very simple and only takes 10 minutes to explain in its entirety, however it is very strategically complex, with a LOT of decisions available.  There is also nearly zero random.    Not suitable for the type of person who spends 15 minutes on their turn deciding the "best" possible action, because there are just too many options available.

Only a 9 out of ten because I had to knock it's awful theme and art direction that while very appropriate and not bad per say really act like camo for a game that should shine like the sun.

I literally stand 3/4 of every game because I need to walk away and take breaks to thinks and get over excited when my opponent makes just the move I needed, to let me play my what ever it was I was wishing I had the thing I needed  to play.  It's like all the mechanics are fighting to become my favorite.

Concorida is about as dry of a Euro as it comes.  Trading in the Mediterranean, forgettable art, there is nothing exciting about this game... except for the mechanics! This game is buttery smooth, it's bare-bone, clever gameplay.  It's a game of efficiency and racing your opponents to prime locations.  There's very little player interaction aside from that on the board, but you do have ton constantly consider how your actions might benefit other players thanks to a card that allows them to follow your action, and everyone benefiting when you cash in on a territories resources.   It moves briskly and is interesting... but it's hard to get too excited about a game of changing resources into resources into money into more resources.

I rated this a 5 because it does notwork for those I play with. The lack of theme for my main group was a big miss, and the fact it has deck building as well. Also I wanted to play this with my dad, but the reading on the cards would have been a little to much for someone with bad dyslexia. He would be able to read them, but it would have been a lot less enjoyable for him. Traded away since it just didn't fit our play groups.

I can't quite decide how I feel about this one.  On the one hand, I find myself thinking a lot about this one after I'm done playing it, thinking about strategy and how best to play this game.  On the other hand, the game is very dry and has no thematic connection of any kind.  It's one of those very well-designed Euros that can succeed sometimes despite its lack of theme.

While the quality of Concordia's box art is hotly debated (but check out that dynamic pigeon in flight on the updated box!), the gameplay itself is so satisfying. It is the pinnacle of mixing simplicity and depth. In our first game, I felt incredibly proud of myself for acquiring all of the Mars cards and deploying all of my colonists. I then looked on with dejection as my wife unleashed a tidal wave of points via all of her acquired cards. Needless to say, I have avoided such a singularly focused strategy in our subsequent plays...

Good, interesting game, although mostly a solitaire puzzle to choose a scoring strategy and try to squeeze the most out of every turn with "random" interference by your opponents and an occasional glance at other players' goods and played cards. Unfortunately, nobody has any real idea how well they and others are doing during the game as everything is only scored at the end of the game. In theory scores can be tracked but that would be very cumbersome and cause massive analysis paralysis and downtime.

Set collection on top of area control (not really an area control game though) via economic/resource management.

It won't take your breath away, but Concordia is a really elegant, well designed midweight game. It has enough interaction to avoid feeling like a solo optimization exercise, and the depth-to-complexity ratio is very good. My only complaint is that the map should have been tighter; thankfully the new (smaller) Britannia map addresses this issue.

With the exception of Imperial, I find the games where Gerdts took the rondel concept and evolved it (Machu Picchu, Concordia) more engaging than the ones where he left it as is (Hamburgum, Navegador).

The rules are pretty straight forward in this one. A solid game. I would play again.  We played a three player game.  The only criticism is that is impossible to have any idea who is winning at any time during the game. So you just try an optimize your turn as best as you can and then at the end of the game when you tally the score you hope you did enough to win.

After playing the game a second time I have reduced my rating as I just do not like that there is no way to know where players stand at any time during the game so the end is a total surprise.

One of the best gaming experiences I've had. Simple gameplay; each turn play one of your cards and carry out the action. Outcome of that is a deep and highly satisfying game.

Can't wait to get more plays out of this one.

It's nice every now and again to run into a new game that is actually a throw back to the classic Euros. Sure, there are some decidedly non-Euro things here such as deckbuilding, hand management, etc. But even when you are navigating those things, the payoff is route building, dropping little wooden houses and claiming majorities. The feel is pure Euro.

I was hoping that deckbuilding would evolve away from being it's own genre and into being just another tool in the shed. I'm glad Martin Wallace is no longer the only one trying. Sure, this is actually just the rondel mechanism moved to cards...but that makes it so much more flexible while at the same time completely eliminating the need for rules about what action you can take and how much it costs you. The cards do all the work and let you focus on the map, so you can make the right decisions about which way to spread your influence.

This is one of my favorite things to come out of 2013.

Concordia comes with beautiful high quality materials. Even before I had actually played the game for the first time I had already ordered the first map expansion ;). The game is very accessible and can be played by children (my daughters (7&11) both love it. Despite its accessibility there is a hughe depth in the game as there are so many ways to score points that it is difficult for even an experienced player to keep track of how far ahead other players are. Definitely one of my favorites at the moment.

RATING: 7
I've spoken at length about why ultimately Concordia failed to endure in my collection everywhere else but here, but now that I've sold it, it's time to give it the post-mortem.

Concordia is still a fine game given its directness and transparency of action, and as long as it's taught correctly, it's scoring dynamic (mid-game scoring is ESSENTIAL when teaching new-comers. DON'T OMIT IT).

Ultimately my problem with Concordia is its lack of escalation and change over time, and this combined with its play-length that even with 3 players begins to wear. Where Navegador has a player-driven, interactive market and dynamics that play off one another, players more or less enact Concordia on their own. The three points of inter-player dynamic being the goods generation/taxation cycle, the escalating costs of trade-houses in single cities and the diplomat card are all good, but not good enough. The diplomat would be the most interesting dynamic given it's a timing bonus to those who use it wisely, and while the taxation dynamic is also fairly solid, it's ultimately less interesting than the dynamic market of Navegador. It also favour one player only and ultimately rather than having a player only able to manipulate the index of one of three goods at a time. By direct comparison, the market/trade action in Concordia is empty of intrigue and is rendered a labour action rather than an interesting one, and the semi-random draw of goods distribution will largely determine the spatial strats of players.

Even though a player may launch all of their colonists, essentially giving them more movement ability in the late-game, this isn't really a dynamic game-changer or terribly meaningful, nor is the extra warehouse space it affords. Concordia's greatest strength - the simplicity of playing one card and executing its action, is also its weakest, as after so much labour, players still enact actions piecemeal, one tiny component at a time. I'm a fan of engines, combos and super-moves, things you earn by the increasing mastery of the systems at hand, but Concordia suffers a pacing problem once the mid-game begins as there is absolutely no escalation.

It also feels as though there aren't any distinct strats, either - everyone is doing the same thing, just in mildly differing ways ie. regions and by what goods -  but everyone is still establishing trade-houses in cities by which they'll score according to deck criteria. Navegador by contrast has the exploration strat, production strats, refining strats, the church, and combinations of those depending on how players want to bias their approach.

It's no surprise that Concordia is Gerdts' most popular title with new-school Eurogamers, and I'll have no problem finding a copy to play in my circles should I ever feel the need, but now that I regard play-length in particular to be a crucial point, in the end, the game doesn't offer enough in the time it has. This is no knife-fight in a phone-booth, and I'm fully aware it's not meant to be. Nevertheless, I'm not terribly fond of trying to throw stones at a thousand miles.

RATING: 4
Played it once and I have to say I was really underwhelmed. I wanted to love this game, but unfortunately I found it to be too long, too lifeless and too repetitive. Maybe my expectations were too high?

There's not enough variety in the cards and the whole end game scoring system is too unpreditable - you spend the whole game hoping that you are doing good, but you can't be 100% sure. Concordia has a few neat concepts but overall it suffers from "low fun factor". 

One of the issues I have with the game is the fact that you have to take way too many babysteps to do what you want - the whole process of collecting all the necessary resources and cash takes too long and is very uninspiring.

After two plays, this one just isn't hitting the spot for me.  I like the game well enough, but there is just a really big missing factor - the game just isn't any fun.

It's very dry, the strategies are relatively apparent, and there isn't very much player interaction.  

So, it's heading out the door.

Surely a good game, most of all due to the millions of slightly different strategies you can follow to rake points out of retty much everything in the board. You decide which of these ways you will follow by taking cards that allow you also more actions, that's great. The best idea is the card that allows you to copy the action of other players: it makes for some very very interesting decisions.
On the other hand, the game is very very slow to start (maybe this is just the problem of the first game) and it is utterly unreadable: you don't know (unless you spend hours counting) how many points you have or the others have. While in Antike you can see everything at a glance, here you just can't know who's winning. I won my first game and I thought i was last!
The game seems very balanced and it seems everyone is reaching the same point after walking different paths. There's no direct interaction and the indirect interaction isn't very important, with the exception of the cards and the diplomat action.
My rating would be a 7.8 but i give it an 8 so far because i am sure i'll appreciate it more after my second game.

I love this feeling Gerds' games give me toward 3/4 of a game, when I am like "gee, this is really a well working game!" Anyways, nothing compares to Antike so far!

The guys on The Secret Cabal had a lot of great things to say about Concordia. A lot. Jumping out of their pants a lot. I love their podcast, but I also know that they can get really excited about new games and they all have a lot of “favorites”. Yet, their review of Concordia drew me buying it, closing out yet another CoolStuffInc order.

Cut forward to TableTop Day and a lot of my friends were requesting this one which I had described as “literally trading in the Mediterranean”. Somehow I managed to wrangle up four other players who thought that sounded good. Well, I have to agree with The Secret Cabal that it is a good game. Like other Mac Gerdts games it has short turns with simple actions which should decrease the amount of analysis paralysis. It has a variable setup and a double sided board (along with another double-sided expansion board) to give you some variability.

Then there’s what makes the game different from Mac Gerdts’s other games: the card play. Instead of using a rondel for action selection like Mac’s other games, you have a hand of cards all with different actions on them: move and build, produce resources in a province, buy new cards, trade goods with the bank, and a reset that allows you to pick up all of your cards. Moving from a rondel to the cards does slow things down a bit, especially when you have a hand full of juicy cards. Yet, as you play you start to understand exactly what it is you’re trying to do and there’s not going to be much that other players can do to stop you from your plans (with the exception of producing goods in the province you were about to use or buying that card you wanted).

I overall really liked this game, the trading works well, the building of a network is fun to watch as it expands across the map, more colonists mean you can expand faster and further, and specialization and diversification are both valid strategies.

My only concern with this game is play time and I’ve only played the game at it’s fullest player count. With five people I think it took us two and a half hours which is about an hour longer than I want it to be. I’ll have to try the game with fewer people and see if I like it nearly as much at the lower player counts.

RATING: 8.9
Well designed game that has very little "luck factor".   Significant amount of strategy and pre-planning required to sequence an efficient spread across the map.   Good replayability.  The new maps and expansion averts what might otherwise become a little repetitive if exclusively playing a two player game.  Scales well, smaller board provides greater tension for two person games.  A five person game gets a little tight in terms of money, which adds further decision making as to how to balance expansion with production and income.  One of the more well rounded games out there!  

It's rare to find a game that provides a feeling of progression, advancement and achievement -all within about 90 minutes (four player game).  Concordia does this well!

To me, Concordia is the pinnacle of elegant game design. The manner in which you deckbuild and take the cards from your discard pile back into your hand is very much unique. Timing can be crucial in Concordia, but even though the game offers a lot of depth and strategic choices, none of them are at any point overwhelming.

Travel the provinces of the Mediterranean and build houses in regions rich in farming, wine, cloth, or brick. Cities in the region start with a random resource. Each player has the same starting deck of action cards with basic actions but also some clever twists. The senator allows a deck building action but when is the right time to buy that card? So many strategy paths to consider; control which set of provinces or resources, or building types, which pantheon fits best with your plans, and which Gods? Even the resource market works very well with the other systems.  Such a slick game. One of my favorites. But, I can't get my game group (or wife) as excited about playing it. Sigh.

UPDATE: If I ever get this game, Salsa is a must get expansion.

I think I would enjoy this a lot more with more players but as it stands the map in the base game is far too large at 2 players and I can't bring myself to buy the expansion with the smaller map. The board is two sided would it have killed the designer to simply make the two sides better for different player counts. Otherwise I like what is going on with the game.

I was quite intrigued when I saw this game for the first time. It took us a while to understand all the mechanics.

After understanding the rules and the mechanics, this is a very fun game and there are more than one way to win.

Some people say this game is very solitaire and that you can plan your moves while your opponents have their turn. I don't agree.

When you try to get the 'bonus' province commodity, you will think about the other player to try to get commodities for yourself, while minimising resources for other players. Also, there is the 'Diplomat' card that allows you to mimic another player's last played card. You may think you have a plan of action, but someone may play a card that gives you a better payoff than your planned move.

The pieces and the board itself is beautifully crafted and the game mechanic is very interesting.

I've only played 4 games so far, but I do believe this is Mac Gerdts best game yet. If this is his latest implementation of the 'rondel' mechanic using cards, it's a masterpiece IMO. Being able to deckbuild to an extend which is also related to how your victory points are scored alongside the actual timing of when you play your cards along with when your opponents play their cards is brilliant.

RATING: 6
Conceptually it's a very easy asynchronous action selection, area control game.

The cards you purchase throughout the game are bought primarily to give you benefits as you play rather than for whatever end game scoring they provide.  You'll also likely be unable to track which card types your opponents have purchased throughout the game.  This means the ending score is somewhat of a surprise as you look through what cards you ended up with and hope your opponents don't have better cards than you.  The focus of the game also shifts in the endgame once the board has been fully colonized.  It's almost as if the whole premise and theme of the game no longer matters and all you want to do is buy cards to score more points. 

What little theme the game has is completely bland.  It's mostly just a hodgepodge of mechanics that surprisingly work very well together, but ultimately you'll feel like you're just buying resources in order to buy cities and cards in order to harvest more resources, and repeat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The game is shaped by the endgame scoring (surprise), so it's unseemly that the system is overly sensitive to players having access to the right cards at the right time.  Particularly when there are only a few cards left and they disappear without all players getting a fair shot at them.

Concordia has some heft and PRAISE THE LORD DOES NOT CONTAIN WORKER PLACEMENT, and that's all good. But I don't have a strong urge to sit through another play.  Especially since the game relies heavily on resources, and the only thing worse than a worker is the resource in his wheelbarrow.

I wasn't much of a deck-building fan in the first generation of those games (e.g. Dominion burned out for me quite quickly).  Now that there's something other than just building the deck going on, I'm finding them more interesting.  In this game, the fact that the cards are both actions and opportunities to get victory points due to actions on the board makes the deck building quite interesting.  The rules make sense and are easy to pick up.  It plays briskly although it's probably too long with five players.  After a couple of plays, it appears that there are multiple paths to victory, and I've picked up the first expansion and, after a couple of more plays, the second.

First play was long but enjoyable.

Update: Prefer it not with five. Planning strategies around the cards seems challenging with more players. The game state changes too much between my turns for my taste. Still like most good games it ends just when your engine gets going. 

Biggest choices seem to be how much expansion to do versus card acquisition and if you go all-in on a particular goal.

First play impressions:

Boy my wife really does not like Mac Gerdts games.  Imperial2030, Antike(all incarnations), Concordia all went splat with her due to general triscuit-dry theme and overly peaceful play of Concordia. 

I thought the flow was decent and could easily be considered a theme and variations on his existing games and distinct of his style.  Diplomat card could occasionally get others to look at my card play/vice versa.  Fair breadth of choices but lifeless experience.

Will pass on future plays.

Worst box art ever.

The game underneath is a very well rounded Euro. The most confusing thing about the game is the scoring, and after one play even that becomes simplified. I like how there are multiple avenues to score and doing really well can be highly amplified through that system. There are a lot of tough choices to make on the board but you can land some nice combos too.

RATING: 8.75
I have played this game a hand full of times and very much enjoy it. It is both deceptively easy to pick up and play, yet it has a ton of depth and strategy while still being a lot of fun.

The game is a step up from the typical "gateway" game but not by much. It combines a lot of simple mechanics in to something that's quite different from anything else that I own.

I like how the cards not only act as your means to perform actions but that once you have used a card you are unable to use that card (action) again until you take a turn to reset your hand. Further, they act as a means to generate points at the end of the game based on the type of card that they are.

This duality of the cards is great as you need to buy more cards throughout the game in order to acquire end game points but at the same time you're going to want certain cards because they allow you to perform new or better actions than the actions that you started out with. The ability to copy someone else's card and gain benefits (goods) from other peoples actions just adds another level of interest to this game and makes you engaged whether or not it's your turn.

And while some complain that you can't really tell who's winning because the scoring occurs all at once at the end of the game, I think that you're generally able to tell who is doing well based on how things are distributed on the board and by seeing the types of cards that they are buying.

At the end of the day, this a great game that has tons of replayability due to the variability in the set-up, maps, cards and strategies of the people that you're playing with.

Concordia is an impressive, "classic" euro style game.  It really is a tightly made, fine-tuned design.  The card play is brilliant and the end game scoring from the cards is genius.  The only thing keeping this from a higher rating is that it truly is a dry game and I rarely say that for games.

This game is a slow deckbuilder set at the height of the Roman Empire where players control families of traders trying to expand their influence and control over the empire by setting up trade posts and generating and selling goods.
The deckbuilding part of this game creates a different gameplay for every player and you can build your deck according to your strategy. Also it influences the scoring for each player and therefore makes the game very variable and play out differently every time you play.

This is a strong, middleweight Euro game.  I enjoy trying to best plan out my turn based on the cards I have made available and what resources I have access to on the board... all the while hoping my opponents won't build in or activate a province at a bad time for me or buy a card I've been saving up for.  If the mechanics of a game aren't enough to grab you by themselves you may not enjoy Concordia for its theme... but if you like a classic feel to your Euro games you can't go wrong with this great title!

I was invited by a friend to a BGGCon and this game really surprised me! It is by far my favorite game I own or have played. It's a Euro-style game that relies both on the board and deck building for actions. You are a Roman merchant influencing the ancient roman empire. While there is conflict with other players it's more about out-maneuvering others than it is actually directly attacking other players. It plays well with multiple maps with the expansion! Make sure to expand your card deck hand! For new players the mock scoring round is key. This game takes about 1 to 2 hours.

For most complex, deep euros there's one thing that annoys me, something that is surprisingly counterintuitive or inelegant.  For Terra Mystica it's the way your adjacent buildings plays differently for end game scoring or building a city.  For Caylus it's the ladder to the blue buildings.  

Concordia didn't have one.  I'm impressed.

Lots of goodness in here. Simple rules, [thing=15600]Kreta[/thing]-style deck cycling, cards that you need to buy for their functionality, but they also define what scores you victory points, so you want to try to optimize that, plenty of hand management and [the good kind] of opportunistic play. It even plays well 2p!

Oh! Also, a solid A for graphic design. The only thing keeping this graphical marvel from an A+ is the lack of a "×⌂" on or beside the sestertii (money) portion of the building cost. Even the setup is depicted on the backs of the player boards. Fantastic!

Played it with 3 players and it's very good. It went long however because there is a setup rule which i had been doing wrong from the beginning. I never removed cards according to number of players. The last two times it was not an issue as i played with 5.

It's an easy going euro game with limited interaction between players. What i love is how simple and quick your turn usually is. Play a card and do what the card says. Even though the interaction is limited i find myself interested at what other people are doing for the following reasons:

1. Whether to use the diplomat or not
2. Who can get cards this turn (i.e. what goods they have)
3. Who can build (again what goods they have)
4. Movement on the board

The only issue is the scoring which for first timers is very obscure until the very end. I tried the intermediate scoring but it adds a lot of time and doesn't really help i think. I will try and do some more examples during rules explanation.

It's a game i would introduce to almost anyone due to it being light on rules even though the strategy might be more demanding.

Update 15/9/2016
Finally played it with 4 and it's definitely the sweet spot for the Med map. This game gets better with every play. This time, i was playing with 2 new players and Greg and i decided to try things a bit differently. I played the Tribune very early on and tried to build a colonist every time. My focus was on Jupiter, Saturn, Mars and the wine Minerva card. Saturn was not worth it as i realised late on that i only had 2 cards. 

This is a very enjoyable game and very easy for people to play though difficult to understand the scoring until after 1-2 plays.

Really like this one.  Hard to do everything you want without careful planning and adjusting to the other players actions.

It's like a rondel, but each player has their own and they all are different throughout the course of the game.

Scoring is weird at first but after 1 game you know how it works.  Bits are great and board is two sided.

Canterbury is a good area majority multiplayer abstract game, but it has it's flaws: It has the potential for king making, the artwork is a bit dull, and there might be some downtime if you play with AP-prone players. You will not be able to plan very far ahead as your best move will be decided by what your opponents do.

An okay area influence game with a moderate learning curve.  Fairly abstract.  Lots of numbers to pay attention to on the building tiles (cost, VP, etc).  The fixed board of squares and orthogonal gameplay makes the game feel forced (limited strategies).  I prefer the game La Citta which is somewhat similar (city building) and uses a hexagon-based board.  I also didn't care for the bonus influence points for being first to bring water; it seemed like the bonus was too big for one or two players who got a good position early.

Read rules.  While it doesn't look particularly innovative or deep, it looks like there's a decent amount of interaction.  It's a tile laying area majority game where laying tiles costs money but gives VPs.  Tiles need to be laid in a particular order (corresponding to service provided areas of the city).  Players score VPs 4 times during the game for having the most services in districts in the city.  Should be fun medium/medium-light game.  Will try to get (or at least play) after the fervor has died down if I can find it for a decent price.

You spend more time adding the score than actually playing the game. Also, the board that tracks the game status is really freaking annoying. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A neat abstract puzzle with just enough theme to make the game interesting: each district needs their basic requirements fulfilled (water, food, religion, military) before more valuable resources (markets, entertainment) can be built. The larger or more important the building, the more districts that building can supply around it. 

The design is fascinating because as each building goes up, it often sets up a chain reaction of new possibilities throughout the board. As the board fills up, your decisions change based on what your opponents have done, so the game is very interactive in that sense. Yes, the game is tricky and can be quite mentally taxing, but it's also very engaging throughout. My only criticism is that the scoring after every phase can get pretty tedious, and we occasionally found ourselves forgetting which districts we scored. Otherwise, great game.

Very interesting game of building with a view to getting majorities in the different regions of Canterbury. Hope to play this again. Seems very tricky to explain how to win and do well but what you do on your turn is simple but the options you have could cause some brain burning. 1 Play.

RATING: 6.5
It works, although it's a bit dry. It's very mathy and fiddly, and completely deterministic. When your turn arrives, stare at the board and figure out how to maximize your position. You can't plan too far ahead, since other players' moves will greatly affect what's available to you.

I'm glad that I got a chance to play it, and I wouldn't refuse to try again, but I doubt there will be many requests for it in the future.

We felt like it could use something a bit more dynamic and/ or random to spice things up, like the occasional invading barbarians (a la Kingsburg) or some way to mess with other players (aside from taking a space/ service that they've got their eye on). That said, I am good at these kinds of games and won handily. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Each placement of a building will affect your score in multiple ways, so serious players can bog down the game by over-analyzing the possibilities. Still, I gladly will play this if someone else wants to, although I'm unlikely to suggest it.

RATING: 4
This is for the most part an abstract game.  It might have a very interesting balance, but I'll probably never find out.  I am not partial to abstracts that have more than 5 or 6 rules.  The worst thing about Canterbury is that there is way too much accounting.  You have to move 4 - 7 markers after EVERY turn.  It's an accounting nightmare.  

But I'd probably enjoy an iPad version of the game.  It wold probably move at an enjoyable pace if someone else were taking care of moving all of the markers each turn.

Medium-weight area control, about 2 hours. Few rules, but several tough decision. Game slows down near the end while people get AP'ed looking for good final moves.

Interesting city-building game with area control as major scoring mechanism.  No luck other than starting player determination.   After a single play, it's tough to process all the information present, I can see some risk for AP in the decision to place buildings, especially from the middle of the game on as players attempt to find ideal plays.  

I do agree with the criticism that there's a lot of tracking going on as each time a building is built, there are a minimum of 3 different scoring tracks that require updating.

It's been awhile since I've played a well-constructed game that has failed to arouse any enjoyment out of me. Canterbury isn't poorly made, but it is so dry that the "city building" theme is steamrolled by abstract placement rules, plodding scoring phases, finicky end-game bonus point tracks, and spatial and constant number crunching requirements to parse out the best move.  None of these aspects are inherently bad, but the way they come together to function as a unified whole really does rob the game of any room for enjoyment.  I think with some additional work, Parks could have made a very intriguing city building game that kept lots of the same aspects (a few which I liked!) while streamlining some others.  Clearly this game works for a number of people and I don't think they're misguided for enjoying a game like this. But for me, Canterbury doesn't create the experience that I look for when playing board games.  "Core Worlds" is still Parks' masterpiece!

Area control game, no hidden information, each action is fast but a bit of maths in the last couple of rounds.  Was worried it would be a bit dry and repetitive (basically earn money one turn, build the next), but the story arc works well.  Well-used mechanisms bring nothing too new to the genre, but the support to adjacent areas, and upgrading buildings works well.  Looks to have been well play-tested to make a nice tight game.

RATING: 7.25
I'm not ready to commit to a rating after only one play, but I liked what I saw of Canterbury.

This is a mid-weight Area-control game, with a couple of category and placement bonuses that also earn important additional VP (Prosperity).

There are (3) very basic choices each turn: collect Taxes and Build (1) building, Build (1-2) Buildings w/out income, or Collect 2x income and Build next turn.  In fact, to me the Build (1-2) Buildings option = Build (2) Small/Medium Buildings most of the time, because the only reason(s) for forgoing income and only building (1) are: A. to build a large Building, or B. to avoid collecting quite as much unspent cash at the game-end for the tiebreaker.

So the game pivots mostly on money management (how much can I collect, what do I want to buy with that, how much do I want to save for next round) and strategic placement (can I get full/shared control of this area, can I improve rewards for this area, can I block that player by placing here, if I provide this service will it open up this space for that player).

The services are a key that I need to get a better handle on before rating the game. Each level of service is needed before players can build the next service building in an area, so missing services can leave an area fallow, but can also prevent other players from taking advantage of your builds to grab a groundbreaking bonus from you.

Services provided are also the key stakes for controlling areas, and once an ownership token is placed it remains there, even if the building is built over later.

So there is a certain amount of tactics/strategy in how players expand services to new areas or stop to lockdown areas where they are ahead, or perhaps even battle to steal an area which isn't locked up.

Since the economic choices are straightforward, players can focus on the rest of the play, and on their opponents' plans- Canterbury manages to be an interactive Euro, despite the simplicity of building requirements. ('I need 4 Reeds, 4 Wood/Stone, and Builder bonus' goes away- 'I need 28 Gold, and I can't get them this turn so what next...')

After a couple more plays, I am a bit torn, but decided this starts at a 7.25.  This is a game which avoids the trap of being a point salad, but which still offers several choices how best to allocate one's capital.

At some point, especially if this gets to the point of subtly manipulating other players' selections, then I seed it continuing to climb, but for now it's still a good new game from 2013.

RATING: 9
I'm heavily biased here, since not only is the designer a friend, but I playtested this game for many years before it was finally published.  But I love it.  It's an area control game in which adjacency is really important, because sometimes things that happen in one region can influence another. The basic idea is that each district requires certain services, but they have a hierarchy of needs which must be fulfilled in a certain order. I tend to like area-control games in general, and I love the way that the city develops differently every game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Based on area control, Canterbury absorbed city building theme. First, I cannot feel any close relationship between the game and the theme. Second, the game has weakness in player's turn order system. The turn order never changes from the start of the game till the end of the game. Especially at the last couple of rounds, this mechanism makes players do what the players have to do. This means game participants have fewer choices while the game is progressing. Third, because of the system, Players usually calculate too much about finding the best arrangement what the players have to do. It spontaneously prolongs the game time long and longer. It makes the game tedious and down time. Especially at the last round, I felt it is somewhat waste of time. Fourth, the area controlling system is very fixed in Canterbury. After certain areas are seized, the supremacy is never changed until the end. Unlike other area control games, Canterbury is not so dynamic on changing supremacy. For instance of El Grande or Dominant Species, those games are ever-changing on controlling areas from the beginning to the end of the game. In Canterbury, however, the supremacy becomes very fixed when the area is full with influence cubes. This mechanics lessen vitality and dynamic aspects in area control. In my opinion, the vitality, ever-changing game progress and unforeseeable circumstances are very important elements in area control games. Canterbury is failed to embody core factors of area control mechanics. For me, I would rather play other area control games.

One well builds up to a city in an extremely oblique manner. 

Like many of today's euros:
-- It takes half a game to grok what's going on, then it's intuitive
-- Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, gain VPs
-- Four-player is a little chaotic
-- I didn't feel like I had any real game role other than I was building to maximize points and prevent (if I could) others from doing the same.

Only three basic actions helps counter *somewhat* the huge AP this game inspires. I think there has to be a sweet spot of too many options and too few. This oddly has the worst of both worlds--too few basic things to do, too many buildings/places to put them.

Endgame doesn't have many options. You'll build what's obvious. Our 4-p game finished with all of us within 10 points of each other. Yet despite such a close race there was no tension. You could calculate it all ahead of time.

The overall concept is pretty cool/elegant but it just didn't translate to fun for me. Didn't hate it, appreciate some of it, won't want to play again.

Played a pre-production copy with the ruleset available in May 2013.

In turn, players either build twice, tax based on the prosperity of the city (which always grows and is one of the game end conditions), or half tax + build once.  Scoring is a combination of the point values of built buildings, area scorings which occur four times, and a majority bonus for providing the most in the six city services.

These six city services are the true innovation of Canterbury.  There are six types of building with escalating service levels: water, food, religion, defense, commerce, and culture.  A building may only be built in a region when all of its prerequisite services are already provided, thus I can't build a church unless the district already receives food and water.  So players have to manage the tradeoff between building and opening up opportunities for other players, as the buildings escalate in point value.  Furthermore, larger buildings allow the placement of a player's service cubes outside the immediate region in which the building was built, thus offering large scoring opportunities to alert players.

Canterbury reminds me of a Chad Jensen title, but streamlined, easier to calculate, and shorter.  I do have a few doubts about whether I will warm to the game based on the area scoring which isn't traditionally a favorite of mine.  I did eventually grow to love both Dominant Species and Urban Sprawl after a couple plays so these doubts are far from a deal-breaker.

Despite my references to complex games in this comment, Canterbury isn't nearly as daunting as those titles.  My 3-player play clocked just over an hour and I didn't feel exhausted at the end like I might after a game of Dominant Species.  It's more fairly described as providing some of the same innovative area-control tension as a Chad Jensen title in a fraction of the time, with a fraction of the brain burn, and far less system-induced chaos.  (Though player-driven chaos remains; sometimes other players' builds are unpredictable and good play will require substantial adaptability I suspect.)

I've backed Canterbury in its May 2013 Kickstarter campaign.  This title may become a solid 8 or even a 9 once it is produced and I get in a few plays.

Pure area control game, not as mean as others, but definatly no MPS game. I usually like more hidden information in my games, but this one works well without, since there is almost no downtime and the economic aspects work really well. Try before you buy, but I had a really good 1st play (4 players, about 75 mins including rules expl.) Want to play again soon. Whish the board artwork was less abstract though, I think it ruins the impression of a sprawling city.

Canterbury feels like it's halway there. It has some clever ideas and plays reasonably fast, but then on the other hand it has absolutely no random elements and this includes the set-up: same board, same buildings, same everything each time you play it. The end result is that even though I was happy enough to play Canterbury once, I'm not too keen on playing it again any time soon.

This is a solid game which plays relatively straightforwardly.  As the city develops, people may take a bit longer to make their decisions about placement, but otherwise the game is simple to play.  No luck with perfect knowledge in this game.  The interwoven scoring via placing buildings which allow you to place influence and move you up an endgame bonus track all at the same time is clever.  However, I do not feel a need to own this one although I am happy to play my friend's copy.  There is no "take that" in this game although clever placement of buildings can be construed to as such/can be annoying...:-)

After a year of shelf sitting I finally got it to the table and we had a lot of fun.  There's not a whole lot involved with the game.  It's area control and engine building for the most part, but its a lot of fun.

Beware that any AP prone players could really slow this game down to a miserable crawl.

I always enjoy good majority games. This one is not bad,but there are more exciting ones around. Do the right things from the start, as your majorities will be counted 3 times. That makes it quite static too. Once you have the majority, you will keep it. And there is a thing about the scoring, which happens immediately when 100, 200 and 300 is passed. The fourth player had one less turn than the others, when the first and second counting took place. So some rough edges, but it's not bad.

Very clever idea (mechanic) here.
To me it's a shame the final result is a dry mathematical (almost abstract) game.
Lacks choices (different actions) and paths to victory, you just get money and wait for the best timing to build in the best areas... and then repeat... and again...

----------------Preliminary thoughts----------------

The game aspect is very functional, it definitely does not please the eye.

It's a quite deep game, very well thought, but it has zero randomness and players will likely develop patrons or scripts concerning decisions and strategies.

I initially liked the game, and definitly I would love to play, but now I think I would not be motivated to play more than a few games. Probably further games would feel repetitive.

Gioco di strategia che è piaciuto a tutti malgrado il fatto che sia decisamente, e troppo, astratto. Le dinamiche fluide e le poche regole lo fanno apprezzare molto. Il gioco parte veloce nelle mosse dei giocatori per poi ingessarsi nel finale quando si allungano un po' i tempi di attesa per valutare con attenzione la scelta migliore.

On the surface it's an appealing variation on area majority. There's 25 areas. That's a lot of areas. The more buildings in an area, the more VPs it earns. Your game is mostly one of alternation. Get money one turn, spend the next. With each building you buy you get to put cubes out - a small building gets you 1 cube out, a medium building gets you up to 5 cubes out (in the area you build and each adjacent area), a large building lets you put a bunch of cubes out anywhere to try and sneak area wins, because most cubes in an area wins it. The money ratchets up as the game progresses, allowing more bigger buildings and more cubes. But in the end, that's all you've got - a game of getting out cubes to win areas. There's no special powers - you can envisage that each game plays much the same as the last - getting out cubes to win areas. It does the same area majority "score after each of 3 rounds" trope as well. And then there's all the counting to award bonuses for most cubes in each building type. It works, but enough already, it's too vanilla. I feel like I've fully explored it after one play.

Canterbury is a multi-layered area majority game in which players are trying to rebuild the old Roman city of Canterbury.  Players levy funds from the city, and use that money to construct building tiles on the grid board, hopefully providing one or more districts with one of six services.  Buildings tiles can be upgraded to more impressive buildings provided that the district doesn't lose any services due to the removed tiles.  A number of times during the game, each district will score for whoever provided the most services to it, and then at the end of the game, each service will score for its own majority.  I enjoy this city-builder--it's fun watching the city evolve over time.

To understand why this game has such a high average rating, you simply have to play it. After reading the rules, I also had the feeling 'is that it, why are people rating this so high?'. Until you start playing: you only have the choice out of 3 possible actions, but which to chose when and to see the opportunities on the board depicting 25 districts is really crucial in this game and will give you a tense feeling while playing.

It's an area control game, where your ability to place guys is dependent on the rules for placing the building tile into the region, and then your ability to afford that tile. 

Perhaps too simple in action choices. There are a Lot of moves you can take that are just as good as any other move. There is also lots of bookkeeping as for each tile placement you advance three different scoring markers. 

Much to my sadness, there's no significant difference in placing buildings in any area of the grid. I enjoy this game, but I was hoping it was going to be of similar intensity as Urban Sprawl. It has potential, maybe with an expansion one day it will up it's depth?

This is a really great game. I agree with the reviewer who said, "The six city services are the true innovation of Canterbury." I love all the ins and outs of the escalating services. Your play will provide a district with one of these services; the higher the service level, the higher the point value. But that also opens up your opponents to even higher service levels and point values. The medium-sized buildings provide those services to neighboring districts, giving you points in more districts but also allowing your opponents to knock down some smaller buildings to make room for a large building.

Raw and spreadsheet like kind of game. Good interaction with the 'area majority' and a good sense of development within the game. I love the way income is provided and that's an elegant mechanism. Generally I enjoy the game although I'm not sure it's one of those games that I choose to play very often.

I'm always looking for new - better - city building games. I like those, but I've yet to find the ultimate one. And this game won't change that, but that doesn't mean this game isn't worth playing.
This game mixes tile laying (on a predefined grid) with area majority and commodity majority. And all of those things grant you points in different ways.
It seems to me that multiple strategies are possible here. I didn't score too many majorities on the types of buildings, but I scored a decent amount on the board, and tried maximizing the in game bonuses you get when starting new areas or upgrading. Other players did try and score as much as possible on the building type bonuses. The top 3 players all where within 2 or 3 from the next player, so a very close score. I came out on top. I was helped by the fact that I was the last player to make a move. I could take my time and calculate which move granted me most points, knowing no one could take any majorities I took away from me.
I liked this game quite a bit, and it certainly deserves more plays. Only repeated plays will clarify if this has any staying power in the long term.

A generally good game.  It's 100% strategy -- no luck aspect, unless you consider the order of the players.  Even then, the game tries to compensate via the Saxon Gold bonuses.

It will take several plays to really understand the strategy, but I'm not convinced that this game will get enough replays.  The gameplay is a little dry, because it does not exploit the theme.  The various services have no unique features -- they only have a cost and a bonus.  Build a "food service" does not provide any food-related gameplay.  It's just another service.

Also, it very easy to lose track of all the different bonus points that can be earned.  A cheat sheet is provided, but it's not detailed enough.  It's helpful to assign score-keeping jobs to all players, so that nothing is forgotten.

Players are building services in the eponymous town, and gain points for themselves and the community. Completely luckless and with no random elements. I would play it more, but my opponent does not like some of the mechanics.

An interesting take on area majority (that I suck at). Influence to areas you are not in can be spread through larger buildings but you have to balance that so you are not short of money all he time and thereby become inflexible. A bit dry but don't fear it becoming formulaic because it won't develop the same way.

There are bad games and their are OK games that I don't like.  This falls into the latter category.

Canterbury is dry abstract strategy game that really has no fun elements to it.

We are Saxon Lords charged to build a prosperous Capital city.  This is a building tile placement game on a communal city grid map. Our actions are funded by levy and taxes.  There are six needs (food, water, religion, defense, commerce and culture) that the Lords compete for in district area control. Straight strategy, no random factor.

This is an enjoyable abstract city building game.  Managing your money to build the best buildings is made interesting by the way the build and tax actions interact turn to turn. The twin majority scoring of both round by round competition in the districts and end game scoring for most services combined with players having a lot of control over when the scoring and end game happen really up the decision potential of each turn.  Of course... there is a last player advantage which might not be adequately balanced by the game's income tiles but its possible with experience this could be mitigated more than I've seen.  Too abstract and fiddly for my wife or the game night crew so I traded this.  I'd grab an ios implementation in a heartbeat though!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
After one play: Seemed fun, but very swingy.  Potentially overwhelming advantage from going last that the minor cash adjustments during the game don't make up for, but more plays are required to determine if this is in fact the case.  Fun, but heavy AP design on the final couple of turns where people are doing a ton of point calculations result in a slight deduction.

Fief is a huge disappointment for me, because since I got into this hobby I was searching for a cool political game and, when I saw this one, I really thought I had found it. I was so intrigued by the ideas in Fief! I wanted to expand my kingdom and increase my power through diplomacy. I wanted to besiege my enemies, make alliances, become king or pope... and this seemed finally that game I was searching for. After a few plays instead I sadly realized that it was not. 

First of all the game really doesn't work with less than 5 players. It's also frustrating, because it's impossible to play without constantly checking the rulebook, as the game is so damn full of tiny exceptions and specific rules. Then, after a couple of plays, I also noticed that you find yourself forced to make the exact same decisions each time you play... There's really no reason not to build windmills as much as possible, as there's none not to make an alliance early in the game. Then again I noticed how important it is to draw the right cards, because they can easily give you a huge advantage, boosting your income, giving you titles or just messing up with your opponents' plans. Later I also realized how much of a "cold war" the conflict of this game is... you just sit on the pile of your troops and nobody really wants to fight, because battles are too risky, because you never know how probable it is for you to win and because, even if you do win a battle, you're worried to become too weak to defend yourself against the other players.

Maybe again this is not a game for me, just because I tend to prefer mechanical games over thematic ones, but I'm deeply disappointed. Fief is just not a well designed game. Its mechanisms are lacking, they force you to make the same exact decisions each time you play and they often stop you from doing what you would like to. It's a very long game where you never get a feeling of achievement. It's really a pity, because everything about it is so promising... and instead is so poorly realized.

This is the Kickstarter edition and includes the Templars, Teutonic Knights, Tactics (easy enough to add in), Crusades and Politique (always use) expansions.  Includes the buildings pack and coins. Moderately complex game.

Playtime: 3+ hours?

Played with 4, which had much more diplomacy than with 3, which was with more battling.  3 players is fine to learn the game, but not after that. Four is okay to play on a regular basis, but five is the best yet.  Six player game was a lot of laughs, but after 5.5 hours with alliances made and broken, there was still no winner in sight, so we called it. 5 player game lasting 4 hours was great fun and not too long.

I'm a bit torn on Fief. On the one hand, the theme is a ton of fun. The experience really is pretty epic. On the other hand, I hate random events ever so much. And, I really hate how easy sieging a fortified city is. That part is dumb. But the game is still a lot of fun. 

It's vaguely in its own category of thematic-euro-war hybridness. If you can handle the swingy, sometimes frustrating curve balls the game throws--it's a neat adventure.

Warning: properly learning the rules can be a bit of a chore. They are occassionally vague and feel pretty scattered throughout the rulebook. The lack of player aid summaries for the special action cards is flat out criminal. I feel like the rulebook has been rifled through during gameplay far more than other games of similar weight levels. I think it's a significant editing issue, but I also think it's worth the work.

I paid through the nose for this one and got the all-singing all-dancing version of the game. I've played over 900 hours of the PC game Crusader Kings 2 and this should be my board game crack. There are some wonderful things in it. 

However, ultimately, it feels like it hasn't been playtested. There are some things in this game that just plain aren't fun. There are wild luck swings (and I'm a big fan of loads of gorgeous Ameritrash). I simply cannot understand some of the design choices with the rules other than 'lulz, they were that way in the 80s and they'll still be cool now bro'. I hope someone takes all the components and rehashes the rules to make a much better, much more satisfying game. This is a chore to play. A very long chore. I don't think I'll ever be able to get my friends to play it again.

3/21/16: Rating went down on the second play.  When you have a pretty good idea of who is going to win based on the initial setup, that's not a good sign.  I've decided that this is very similar to the game 'Diplomacy' with a lot of random events thrown in.  After the first play I was thinking about getting the plastic windmills and towers, and after the second play I'm thinking about selling the base game.

3/02/16: Fun for the non-euro crowd.  Got to be comfortable with swings of luck as your lords die off or famine hits your area.  You may want sons and end up with only daughters.  I think that it's more of a storytelling experience, and you need to enjoy the journey.  It's a lot of fun becoming Pope or King, but don't let the power go to your head.

Plays best with 5-6, and I'd try it with four, but not fewer.

For those that enjoy American-Style games, there may be something here. But for those that are more of the Euro-style persuasion, I would be cautious about playing this game. Personally, I identify more with the latter and found the game to be excessively random and frustrating to play. It is a game with lots of dice-rolling/randomness, events that can't be mitigated (plague), and one that injects elements of meta-gaming with little/no control. And it is a game that is built upon a clunky/dense rule-set that is unjustifiable considering the decisions it creates.

That being said, the production quality of the game is astonishing; the art is well done, components printed to high standards, and the plastic buildings well-detailed.  But despite the nice components, the publisher missed opportunities to make the game more accessible; most noticeably was the poor iconography on the cards and no player-aid for those cards. Thus, the game feel more overproduced than anything... beautiful on the surface but clunky, dated, and annoying to play.

A good game, mix of diplomacy and combat, nice the system of alliances through marriages. The cards can change a battle plan by killing the Lord or escaping via secret roads, so it's better not to be too sure about the outcome of the battle. Finally it's a good game, without the pretense of a war simulation, but a good combination of luck and strategy.

Very nice unique area-control game with a  twist. I love the titles aspect of the game. The thing that you are fighting not only for territories but also for the church and royal titles. It adds a lot of flavour to this game and makes it a lot of fun to play. The option of marriages that makes alliances and whole family aspect is also good.
It can be a little bit overwhelming with the amount of rules and exceptions regarding the requirements and benefits of each title but after 1-2 games it should be intuitive and for me it is worth to spend some time learning to have fun later. 
Also this game tends to be chaotic and a bit random. You have to play it knowing and accepting it. Things can change quite drasticly with murder, justice, plague, revolts and so in. Important characters may die changing situation on board with a single card played. Its a good game to play for fun not to play strategicly like GOT for example.
One downside is that it best plays with 5-6 players.

Juego ambientado en la Francia Medieval, en el que cada jugador se hace cargo de una familia, que deberá gestionar para ir consolidando una posición de poder, tanto civil (rey, reina, principe) como eclesiástico (obispo, cardenal y papa). 
Se pueden casar miembros de una familia con miembros de otra y forjar así alianzas.
La victoria se consigue en solitario, obteniendo tres puntos de victoria, o en alianza, con cuatro puntos.
Es muy temático y los componentes son una auténtica delicia.
Las reglas son sencillas, pero abundantes. Conviene tenerlas claras antes de empezar, para saber cómo avanzar.

Very fun game once you get the rules down. Due to the picture based cards there was a lot of passing around the rulebook to figure out what your card did. There are quite a lot of components too which is daunting at first but on your second play through it gets easier. Definitely better for advanced players that are used to the rules from the board games of today

RATING: 4
I see there are a bunch of small-ish expansions for this, and I wonder if you add some of them in, you get something with a little more nuance where negotiations might be interesting enough to make this into a game? Not motivated to find out personally though. Complexity would start to be a huge problem.

---

After playing again, the rating goes way down. The 70s/80s aesthetic on display here is just way too retro: very random, very process-intensive with few real decisions, and lots of crazy, swingy, punishing randomness. Turning the screws on the game length is great, but it just makes small mistakes hard to recover from, if you don't do the right thing in setup and the first turn or two (or just get hosed by random events), you don't have a foothold and if the other players have played before you're screwed. All this would (or might anyway) be fine if there was a working diplomacy/negotiation angle, but there is little or nothing to trade or bargain over, and what's in there (various tedious votes with an awkward voting mechanic, negotiation tokens, odd marriage rules, and whatnot) don't really work, or don't work at all. The game clearly wants to be a deal-making/negotiation game, but it just doesn't give you anything to work with. The battle system is also lame.

Last huge problem, the complexly on this is both high and with lots of sharp edges, the model is often unrealistic, and the production design does little to help you grapple with all of it. The aids are huge walls of text, the card iconography is confusing, and there is generally little to no clarity from the layout of components. A lot could have been done to make this more playable for casual or infrequent players, but like most 70/80s designs, they just assume you're going to play it a ton and by game 5 or something it'll all be no problem. Needless to say, this is not the current gaming reality.

Anyway, there is a lot to not like in here, and I definitely did. Not like it, that is. I think for fans of either the 70s/80s aesthetic or general so-called 4x games, the short playing time is nice and it's got decent narrative. But for me, the 30+ year old gaming technology is really creaky.

---

Fine, if a bit retro - it definitely feels like the 80s game it is. Still, makes a virtue of relative brevity. Keep the player count up - 5 is probably the minimum. Constraints on negotiation are a little hacky and inelegant but serve a needed purpose. Not really my thing - I'd much rather do Dune, Titan, or Kremlin - but not bad for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Very much enjoyed this as it's an excellent take on the political intrigue focused area control game.  Kind of fills that Game of Thrones niche but more focused on finagling titles from owning Fiefdoms as well as working your way up in the Church.

While the game is crunchy, the narrative is surprisingly strong.  More drama than a typically game in this genre due to a very flexible movement system, interesting card play that ignites colorful events, and lots of political maneuvering in wrangling votes and trying to possess religious power.  

There's lots to interact with and chew on here strategically, but the core system is pretty simple.  There are quite a few exceptions and small niggling rules that may be difficult to remember.  Overall though the flow is great and clean.

Beware though, the game does have a fair amount of random screwage.  A plague can pop up and wipe out the majority of your noble family out of nowhere.  You can recover from this but it's still a huge dagger in the ribs arbitrarily handed out.

I must admit that I like the idea about this type of game (heavy “epic” negotiation game) more than I actually like the game itself… And I even played it with the full number of players, and the players were even the best you could think of for a game like this (backstabbing, trash-talking etc. kind of guys)!

Games like this always, unfortunately, fall flat for me. I want them to be epic and a lot of fun, but it boils down to a “meh” experience which takes 5 hours… The idea of marrying into each other’s families, the pope mechanism where you have to ask favors etc. are some of the good mechanics in this game, and I also like that the bishoprics and the fiefs overlap which means that you’re going to have to fight, negotiate and really think about how you are going to conquer the various cities. There are several interests at stake!

However, the actual gameplay is somewhat boring with boring battles (and a lot of units killed in each battle), random event cards (although I don’t think that they’re as crippling as some reviews state) and a somewhat boring game end once a player (or an alliance of players) are close to reaching the required 3 (4) VPs… I think the game can really drag by then as players are obviously trying to ensure that other players don’t win, and it means that the game can be somewhat slow-going near the end, and turtling isn’t uncommon.

Furthermore, in my first playthrough, one player practically got eliminated during the FIRST round of play… He only had a couple of troops left and honestly couldn’t do anything, and I cannot see how that would change going forward. If you cannot do anything, 5 hours is a long time to wait… But I admire him as he didn’t whine about it at all – I know I and almost everybody else would!

Fief is a fantastic game. It has some quirky rule nuances but they become intuitive by the end of the first game. This game is very heavy on diplomacy and because of that it's easy to go from first to last quickly.  There is very little luck involved other than battle dice, which have a cleaver mechanic.  Play Fief with 5 or 6 people who like to wheel, deal, and occasionally backstab.

Fief is a game I was interested in trying... dudes on a map, diplomacy... these are things I like.

After one (mostly complete) play, I can say that it made me want to play A Game of Thrones instead :) There's a few things that irked me about this game. The voting for roles such as Pope, King, Bishop etc. were often foregone conclusions. It felt procedural with no real tension. 

But maybe the biggest drawback was the win condition. I married another player fairly early, we were sitting on 3VPs, we had a dominant position over three other players, but we had still a lot of work to do to gain that 4th VP for the win. The result was a game where the other three players could see the inevitable end, but no one at the table was equipped to bring the game to a conclusion.

Granted, it was one play, but if I had five or six I'd lobby for AGoT the next time!

This is a truly well wrought design. The theme is very strong and carries a lot of the burden for remembering what rules apply (no bishop can be king, etc.).  I don't know why so many people think it is either hard or long. The very first play WITH teaching for us was three hours. So, gametime was 2 hours. Turns move pretty fast and interesting choices are plentiful. We had a ten year old play with us and she got the basics enough to be our first king.

This release is well done. The rulebook is a little loose with its writing, but common sense covers the gaps. 

Good, fun game.

Updated a bit:
Well this game has, surprisingly, been declared "lots of fun," by my wife. Surprising because there is direct conflict. A lot of it. And combat. A lot. But there is also political scheming, and marriages, and alliances.

I like the game a lot, in its loose, ameritrash (by way of France) style. The theme is so strong that when a rule is unclear or a situation not covered in the rules pops up, it is fairly easy to come up with the obvious rule that should take effect.

So far this game has made it to the table three times in about two weeks at my house, which is a LOT considering it is a 2-3 hour game. You feel like you always have something to do and that your actions matter...

However, there is, though it is rare, possible player elimination in the game. Usually it takes some pretty poor moves on that player's part for that to happen, but it can happen. This can hurt if it is early in a game (hard to come back from) or late in the game (hurts to lose all the time you invested). When that happens, it is best to go with the game as a story because you can still matter in the game- case in point, a player who was effectively eliminated in my last game, was allowed to spawn near an enemy player whose castle I was about to take. He respawned as D'Arc and managed to buy one man-at-arms. Then he came to the aid of his "ally" when I stormed her castle with a secret passage in order to steal the victory away from another pope player, that D'Arc character kicked my ass in battle against a vastly superior force... and became the final kingmaker.

Got the Metal coins and plastic buildings and all expansions. They add quite a lot of fun and atmosphere to the game, and I recommend them.

Need to use as many optional rules and such as possible. Gotta get this out again!

Yeesh.  I really didn't enjoy this.  Marriages turned our five player game into a two player game?  (Odd person out was effectively eliminated).  Didn't really matter, the game was short and won without any land being taken.  I recommend strongly against the "Fog of War" rules.  Attacking is bad enough as it is to be further discouraged by unknown defensive force.  Draw great cards is a solid strategy.  Nothing really made much sense.  All told, there are way better dudes on a map games than this.  MB Shogun for instance.

[September 2015 - 6.6]
There are some things I love about Fief, and there are things I don't like about it. Ultimately, the latter issues bring it down a bit.

My favorite part of the game is the area control concept with fiefdoms, bishoprics and windmills. For controlling fiefdoms, it's about controlling all the villages within that single fiefdom, plus a stronghold and having the money to buy the fiefdom titles. Fiefdoms are then part of larger bishoprics, which all include parts of other fiefdoms. To win control of those, you don't need to control all the spaces, but rather have enough spaces for a majority (plus an eligible candidate) to elect your candidate bishop. Finally, for controlling the windmills (the main money generator of the game, you just need to control the specific village. Couple this with some standard (although at times fiddly) combat and negotiation and I think it's a good game.

But wait, there's more... but that's not a good thing. For then there are very fiddly conditions, rules, votes and negotiations to elect a pope and king, and then the possibility for a queen, crown prince, and excommunicated bishops. Plus, complete luck-of-draw cards will help determine cardinals (who are the only ones who can become pope). These cards can also (by complete luck of a die roll) determine where plague hits  to decimate your lords and armies, or who has the most powerful army leader with "D'Arc" card.

To me, these elements introduce too much negotiating, luck and king-making. The game starts to bog down with a lot of downtime as everyone tries to run through the million scenarios, or spends time checking the rules.

If that wasn't enough, alliances are allowed between two players (essentially combining their points), which can bump up the king-making. Those alliances are pretty set for the game, too ... unlike, say, Cosmic Encounter, where alliances last only a turn and shift to keep leaders in check. Two people can ally early, corner off a section of the board and win pretty easily.

A slew of expansions add more complexities (although, I haven't explored them all.)

So, after three plays (our games have run in the 3-5 hour range) this game has some problems for me. For which, there might be some variant fixes ... 

One that definitely improves the game is allowing only one windmill per village.  This forces expansion (instead of turtling all the windmills in a corner) and leads to more change-of-hands in windmill control. 

We've also considered variants for alliances, including not allowing them until the third round or having some cost to them (eg. paying a dowry).

Beyond that, some major game changes would need to happen to remedy problems I see, including...

>> Streamlining the King and Pope elections and powers. Giving the King and Pope both victory points and special abilities is a little too powerful and tend to make the rich richer.

>> Eliminating the random negative events, or, maybe keeping a few that can cast by the players.

>> Having at least two of the cardinal titles be purchasable (instead of just one), and disallowing any single player to get more than one cardinal card.

>> Eliminate the D'Arc card or increase its number of cards with the same rule that no player can use more than one. Or, give the D'Arc card to the player with the least amount of points, villages, money after the third or fourth round.

Ultimately, I feel as if the designers of Fief introduced some of these random luck elements of disasters and powers to serve as checks and balances to the game ("oh, but a plague could hit the leading player ... or the last-place player could get the the powerful D'Arc"), but it doesn't usually work that way, and it really sucks when the last-place player gets hit by the plague or the leaders get all the cardinal cards and the one D'Arc card.

Some nice ideas and good production values but a slight disappointment in terms of play.

- A lot of randomness and swings cards mean things can just happen to you or land in your lap without any real connection to good or bad play.

- The combat mechanic is very old school and dicey.

- Plays long with a full complement of players.

- Quite a lot of fiddly rules.

- Probably a reasonable game lurking in here if yo have six players who can get together to play the game several times - but there are so many other games will that ever happen.

- Play Dune or Game of Thrones instead.

Been able to bring this to the table quite a few times now.  Yes, yes, people will love to slap it around for being an 80s-era design, but that doesn't mean it isn't fun.  Swingy?  Sure.  Fun?  Totally.

Have never played with less than 6 players.

The game flows quite nicely and the iconography takes some getting used to, but it's also got sort of a kitchen-sink design in that there are a lot of tiny little things that play into each other, which is typical of this sort of game.  This makes it a bit of an ordeal to teach, but once the ball gets rolling, it moves at a nice clip, provided you can get people to shut the hell up and make their moves lol

But yes, if you are the Euro-ey type who loves open information, equal footing, close scoring, bla bla bla, go home.  Dig out your Stefan Feld and leave this one behind.  This game can be summed up in one word: brutal.

Given its roots in the original 80s-era, this game pre-dates all of that "let's get along" gameplay coming out of Germany.  No, my friends, this one is entirely about horrible things happening to good people and good things happening to horrible people.  On one turn, you could be made King of France, adored by all, married to a loving Queen with a Crown Prince waiting to take the reigns, but on the next, some jerk with an assassination card gets the king killed, is elected Pope, and excommunicates the Queen just because he can.  Not good enough?  How about a plague card that gives you a 50/50 chance of living?  The more of a scumbag you are, the more likely you are to be rewarded - my kinda game!

Such as it is, the game can be prone to wild swings of just unfortunate things happening, but that is all thematic.  France in 1429 was not exactly a place where people had healthy, long lifespans.  Even in combat, you can expect that lots of people are going to die, regardless of how much power you bring to the table - the little guy is definitely going to get his shots in before he eats it.  Your Lords can be captured, assassinated, ransomed, stuck in the rain, etc.

Yet through all the chaos, there is an underlying political game that drives the action.  You can only get your very-rare points from three avenues - become a baron, count, or duke; become King; or become Pope.  That's it.  Everything else just facilitates that.  Control the cities and you control the elections.  Control the church and you control who becomes Pope.  Marry the right player (alliances) and you can see victory on the horizon... often to have it suddenly and very violently taken away from you.  It's the bee's knees!

As far as expansions go, Crusades seems to add quite a bit of overhead to a game that is already quite long, so we went without it.  But the Politics expansion is definitely a must as it gives each Lord some character and results in some hilarious stuff like the Unlucky Lord preventing mills from generating income, or even swingy stuff where the Tyrant can get more money than everyone else... at the cost of being susceptible to sudden (and very violent, again) uprisings.  The Tactics expansion allows you to mitigate some of the chaos of battle, but I felt that the archers were way too powerful - your battle could literally end before it begins because all hits are assigned simultaneously.  Need to examine that one more closely.

At any rate, this game is not for everyone, especially those who like to game for the puzzle aspect that our hobby can provide - Fief 1429 is no puzzle.  It is simply political and military warfare and nothing is fair about it.  That's where the fun lies.  Sometimes, no matter how well you play, luck just isn't on your side and you will find yourself falling from top to bottom.  If that doesn't sound okay to you, then stay away.  If you're more interested in the narrative, theme, and generally enjoy the chaos, you will love this one.

I backed this game on Kickstarter due to viewing a preview on Shut Up & Sit Down.  When I learned that it was being published by Academy Games, my expectations for the game grew.  As of this review I have only played the game once with a group of six people, but feel that we played a very complete game with only one or two things not thoroughly explored.

Fief: France 1429 is a game that does not play out a history lesson much like Academy Games' previous entry Freedom: The Underground Railroad, instead it is very much a sandbox dripping with theme.  You will play as 1 of 3-6 families that are vying for land, titles, and position.  The game is won when a person attains 3 victory points either by earning a Fief title, becoming Pope or becoming King.  However, players can have their families marry to create a joint victory where 4 victory points will give two players the win.  Each round players will either announce marriages or vote for offices, draw and resolve cards, collect income, buy resources, battle, and see if they achieved victory.  Rounds progress rather quickly (once elections are finished) and there is little downtime.  Players have open negotiations and any elections that occur are resolved by simple voting.  However, players can exchange diplomatic tokens with another player to privately discuss for three minutes away from the group.  

When we all started the game, we did not know what to expect and by the end, we all had an epic experience (with the exception of one due to some really bad things happening to her).  The game allows you to have up to 4 members in your family all of which can have titles and be used to achieve your goals.  There are cards you draw which have effects such as creating cardinals or becoming a Joan D'Arc character if you have an available character.  There are disaster cards in the draw decks and will resolve each round.  These cards can be mitigated with other cards played by any player (for a price if they want) except for the plague card.  If a plague card comes out in a bishopric, all troops are halved and players roll to see if their family members live or die from the plague.   

Our game saw the rise of the Papacy, alliances form, wars break out, a King crowned and a joint victory.  Had we not started so late, the game could have changed with one or two moves to keep it going, but ultimately, we ended the game after 2 hours.  The thing is, we all wanted to play again and spent about an hour afterwards talking about the game.  Academy Games knocked this one out of the park in my opinion.  While not quite as heavy of a theme or as much historical info as Freedom, this is one that deserves to be played for any fan of the time period or if you are a fan of games such as Game of Thrones.

Fief incorporates a lot of interesting ideas, but it doesn't seem much concerned with making a strategic game out of them. Admittedly, I dislike the randomness of the event cards in Game of Thrones and Dune/Rex, but for the most part they're manageable. Here I actively despise the randomness of the cards.

At the start of the very second turn of our five player game, a plague hit me and my neighbor, automatically killing half our armies and leaders. In addition, our income was slashed by additional event cards. He was left with one female leader and I with one male leader -- each of the two of us drew a total of one more leader over the course of the game, whereas the other three players each had four leaders for the majority of the game. On the other hand, I lucked out in the third round where I had the only eligible candidate for the king (the other players had only female fief lords with all titled males as bishops/cardinals). A fourth round alliance with my other neighbor allowed for a joint victory (fief and king, fief and fief) without any realistic chance of any opponents being able to take away a point (moreover, one member of our alliance had a lock on the Pope for round 5 if it came down to that). 

The victory did not feel at all fulfilling. Whatever strategy or tactical prowess any of us displayed was far overshadowed by the luck of the draw. I will say that I actually liked the simplicity of troop movement and combat in the game, as well as the concept of having titles and elections and heirs (if not so much the mechanical practice thereof). Our first play of Fief was significantly faster than any game we've ever played of Game of Thrones (with either expansion) and considerably less stressful. 

In short, I'd give Fief another shot, but it's a lighter, more luck-driven game than we expected.

You know how sometimes a game has all the nouns and verbs you think you want from a game, but none of the feel you're looking for from these things? This one ticks all my buttons, with "Kings" and "Popes" and "dynasties" and "excommunication" and "armies," but it feels like a resource management Euro.

There are two things that I REALLY don't like:

1. There is a punishing degree of randomness that can't be mitigated, especially in the early game. I kept drawing cards that might be useful, if met the criteria, but it's tough to meet said criteria early on. I kept drawing cards that weren't useful, and didn't get a second leader until turn 3 or 4. It got frustrating. May be fixable with a less punitive hand limit.

2. The start is so slow. Start with a single province and take others at a snail's pace (at which point some of your cards might be useful). I don't see the advantage of making setup the first three turns of the game. This needs an advanced setup sort of like TI3.

This game needs multiple plays with the same group to really shine.  

The biggest beef comes from the rules, with multiple versions (English vs. French) the grey-area interpretations can be confusing/conflicting.  That said, a keen eye can still find answers to most rules questions in the book.

The Pope is very powerful. Don't ignore an alliance or it will steam roll you.

Definitely one of my deepest and most intense gaming experiences. There's so much going on and even if it's not your turn, you always have to be aware what your opponents (and even your allies) are doing. During our 6-Player Game almost every alliance got broken sooner or later. Stay away, if you don't like backstabbing, in your face, cutthroat take that games! There's much open but even more secret conflict in this game. Dare you not to rest on your laurels! You'll always be in somenone's path to victory.

Hopefully we'll get it to the table as often as possible. Might become one of my all time faves.

Components are really nice. Like wooden die. It has some print issues but nothing thats a game breaker.

Played twice so far. Both resulted in shared in victories. Some may not like the randomness of the disasters. They can really muck ones plans. The diplomacy is really cut throat and reminds me some of AGoT. One of those games where the results of the plague or where heavy rains end up leads to moans or cheers and laughter.

Great theme with nicely flowing game mechanics.  The nobles really start to shine with the politic expansion.  The tactics expansion makes combat more interesting as well.  The disaster events are simply too heavy-handed.  The rules for captive nobles exercising their privileges while in prison leave me scratching my head.  Also the siege rules allow for some counter-intuitive happenings.  However, with a small set of house rules, it provides a satisfying game.

RATING: 10
A thrilling game revolving around negotiation. You need 3 VP (or 4 VP in a marriage/alliance) to win. Victory points are very hard to get—and it's nearly impossible to get 3 without some sort of negotiation (even if that negotiation amounts solely to marriage to another player's lord, who later dies, bequeathing you all sorts of titles and points you need to win).

The game is very tight—very well done, and even though at first feels a bit random, it is obvious that the card-driven events are there to ensure that players who are in the lead either strive to win quickly or risk defeat at assassination, the plaque, or execution through justice.

This is the spiritual successor to Dune—just without all of the hardcoded player/house asymmetry. The asymmetry arises dynamically in the game as players gain powers associated with titles—powers which can be lost as lords die off.

It's quite an engaging game that elicits alliance making through negotiation and betrayal.

I knew I wouldn't like this game due to the amount of luck involved, but I had to play it with a couple of friends. 

However, I wouldn't have thought that it's that bad. This is completely luck based. In the first round, 2 or 3 of the players lost their Lord (and troops) within the first turn, just because the cards came up that way...

A complete waste of time, you're better off playing Monopoly.

This one definitely feels like an older game, but it is still a very playable design.  Very enjoyable, and the game pushes you to wheel and deal, and back stab your way to victory.  Unfortunately if everyone decides to turtle the game could be really boring, and long.  If everyone engages with the game and the other players, the play length is reasonable and the diplomacy is a lot of fun.

Awesome game, great balance between playtime/complexity & fun..!
The game drips of chrome..! Marry into an alliance, sell the holy grail for support to become pope.. the possibilities feel endless while the rules are kept manageable.

One of the few games i can really immerse myself.
Artwork of cards is rather bad, but everything else is top notch as usual from acadamy games.
As usual with academy games some rule ambiguities still linger.

UPDATE: The english rules have holes as big as Canada! Do not expect to get a game with solid rules.. BUT! i don't care.. the game is still excellent. If in doubt you can always look at the original (french) rules & decide to follow them.

I've played this now like 6 times & i can't get enough.. the storytelling, subtleties, theme/artwork, balance is simply incredible. I wonder why no one else came up with something as involving as this.

btw. pimping the game with those metal coins & 3D buildings.. totally worth it!
________________

EXPANSIONS:
With 6 you should at least add one or two expansions, so that there are more VPs around.. otherwise games can take veeery long.

Tried both optional FoW & Relics rules, both excellent. Money is hidden in our games. Diplomacy marker we don't use, they're stiffling & fiddly and gameplay flows much better without them.

TACTICS EXPANSION: Awesome. Every bit of it. Makes the battle slightly more interesting & gives more theme to the king & queen with their guards. The mercenaries are probably the best, that bidding at the beginning makes for some good & tough decisions, also fighting can start much earlier with them.

Really requires 5 players. With 4, the board is too open and you don't really experience the joy of the game, which is the political offices, backstabbing, alliances, and more. Eager to play more, but a little disappointed that 4 didn't quite work.

Very complex, but worth the learning curve. One of the most thematic games in my collection. Going to toss in Tactique and Politique for my next play.

REALLY sounds up my alley, strong theme and historic, diplomacy/out of room negotiations/alliances, backstabbing, hiring assassins and now mercenaries in new version, escaping prison through tunnels, stoning Bishops, oh and killing your wife is an option! Bwahahaha

Sounds like it swims in the same seas as AGOT and Virgin Queen which sits well with me. There is some large randomness that concerns me though, not sure just how much control is lost and how huge it is, and if its going to be tweaked in new version (apparently some things are). 

It does sound like Uwe is planning some neat changes for sure

Edit - One of the reviews confirmed it for me, the plague would probably ruin the game for me completely with rules as written. I would likely want to omit this or weaken it, the effect of this completely random (no way to mitigate either) event is just too strong for a long strategy game imho, historic or not. Rest of the game still sounds excellent

Edit - Honestly Uwe should have known better, this is piss poor development in my opinion (and not the first time, Strike of the Eagle rules resemble Swiss cheese) since these Plagues were the biggest well known complaint about the prior versions. Here, with a new version, you have a chance to dumb them down along with so many of the other high luck elements, of which there seems to be many, not just Plague. Really at the minimum, variants should have been playtested and offered, or having the strong random elements BE a variant.  

Instead, someone arbitrarily gets hosed (randomness is not as bad if it targets everyone, but large bad effects singling people out in a long game is pure BS imho) and their game gets ruined, and they never want to play again. I haven't even played yet (and won't without houserules) and I'm mad, because the rest of the game looks so good. A pity.

Only played once with 5 players; obviously 4 of them entered in marriage, and the other one... had no option but kingmaking whatever his movements or acts. I should play it more times for a definitive appraisal. The battles are dull, dice rolling feasts, with no stack limit. Definitely it's not an Euro, not an Ameritrash, it's a Jeu de société, so the most important here is the group.

背景設在法國1429年的百年戰爭後，法國身為戰事進行之地，國土滿目瘡痍，人民流離失所，期間又逢黑死病爆發，各領主募集軍隊，平民出身的聖女貞德加入有如如虎添翼，擴張王室統合權力。
這個遊戲充滿了談判、合作、背叛、收買、威嚇、聯姻、割地、合縱連橫，雖然遊戲時間長了一點，但玩後的感覺卻很回味，對於歷史背景非常的有帶入感，宗教在那個時代的力量十分強大，玩家必須成為教宗、國王，拿到領地，建立權力核心的強大聯盟來獲取勝利~~

Kickstarted with $15 set of plastic buildings. Looks like a brilliant, complex game with plenty of strategic options to keep it from becoming Risk. 

With all the expansions and new content being included with the base game for a $65 pledge being sold separately later as stock permits for $65, this is a raging good bargain especially since shipping is included in US, Canada and some European countries.

The campaign promises June 2014 delivery but with so many stretch goals achieved and requiring further development, I will be surprised if I receive this game before the end of 2014. That's OK... in the set of "good, cheap, and fast" I will always choose good and cheap.

Knights on a map, sets of territories, titles, voting, windmills, action cards, and random events. Like other mediaeval expand-and-exploit games like Warrior Knights and Excalibur (both of which are predated by the original Fief), this has its share of inelegant and/or flawed rules. The question is whether the thrill of political and logistical developments more often than not will justify the time and maintenance involved. In my first game there was a little initial expansion and posturing, then three players had a big fight, then the remaining two, one of which was me, formed an alliance and there wasn't a lot the others could do to stop us from winning. It didn't feel like a whole lot had happened, but it tooks hours; obviously you could spin this fact either way. Incidentally the outcome came as something of a surprise, since just previously I had thought myself reduced by plague and circumstance to "troublemaker and whipping-boy", to borrow a description from M. Dontanville. If I play again I will want it to be with six.

Not my favorite genre.  But still this game has some nice features.  It reminded me of other warfare games I used to play back in the 80's.  We played with 3, and I would avoid that if possible - the board is too open, and it turned into a race to collect titles.  I suspect this game really needs 5 to work best.

AFter my first exposure, I suspect that with a higher player count, the alliance rules become more important, and the self-leveling efforts of the field keep the leader from winning too easily.

I'd like to try this again.

I Kickstarted this game.  After several plays now, I can say that this game is more fun than I thought it was going to be.  Though, it is still pretty complicated.  It's not the type of game I would binge play, but it would be a fun every now and then kind of game.  It's enjoyable, fairly difficult, and the diplomatic nature of the game makes it fun.

Don't play this with an uneven number of players otherwise someone is going to be severely disadvantaged in this area control game. Really enjoyed the alliance, negotiation bit. But the card events are pretty darn random which can obliterate your strategy in an instant. Not an easy to teach game, not to mention some wonky euro-y symbols new players may have a hard time understanding.

The best thing about this game how player interaction is encouraged in the game from the very first round! All systems are somewhat interlocking and there is the very appealing option to team up and occasionally backstab (although backstabbing is not really required or often exersised in this game. My only gripe is that the rules are somewhat antiquated and show its age. You have to constantly look up rules or make them on the fly. If this, and the fact that the game has random events that might set you back significantly, does not bother you, you can have a lot of fun with this game! I enjoyed the plays and I'm dying to play this again!

FF1429 was a wild and crazy, and utterly memorable experience for my game group. It is unlike any other game I've ever played with the politics and betrayals.

Very nicely implemented game with elements of "Axis and Allies" and "Diplomacy."  There is a fair amount of chrome that gives the game some excellent medieval flavor without it devolving into a morass of overly complicated rules.  Playing time is a bit long and the winner(s) can be fairly obvious in advance and need to grind out a last point for a while if the others conspire to work against them.

Great diplomacy game who has too much ramdomness. Everything around titles, diplomacy and struggle for VP is very well implemented.

As much as all those who shelled out for the KS version want this game to be good it just isn't. It has the potential to be but the game is so upended by some of the random card flips that it seems like tons of wasted time and effort. 

I would probably play it again but if there was not some great revelation about the game in my 3rd play that would be the last time.

RATING: 6
Long, a bit convoluted, and unbalanced (until people get to know the intricacies? But doubt it gets played again in my group). But made for a great story when my husband (married to one of my female nobles in the game) led a major siege that would have secured us the win, lost and retreated, was killed in the counter-attack, so I offered my hand to an unaffiliated player who was about to besiege my castle (with a chance at the win, but facing an assassination), so he agreed to the marriage, we sat through the next turn, and won the game as a couple. Some say that shouldn't be able to happen, but it was a great story and thematic... even if my late husband (or the other power couple) thought it was an awful ending.

But when I played.. wooohoo! Exactly what I initially hoped it to be. The first(and only) game was a blast.
Currently my 1st choice if I'm able to gather 5 or 6 Players. 

Diplomacy at its BEST. The problem is time, in my group we discussed for hours instead of playing. It needs an iron fist game master to control it. You want to talk a moment more - use your damn diplomacy token!

Fief is a real gem, every player enjoyed this game.  Has all the intrigue you might want, with some good battles, and the ever present possible disaster.  Alliance abounded, with some funny back stabs.  Wife goes after husband's faction after he moves through her territory without permission.  This woman becomes the husband's game long scourge, lol's abounded.  Simple rules, good fun, anticipating the expansions to be more of the same.  Highly recommended.  Game is moderate length, expect 4 hours with 4 players if new.  Expect 6 hours with expansions and 5-6 players, and they know what they are doing, but game can end quick too.

On the surface, Fief seems like a game I might like. I enjoy area control, I'm interested in some war games and especially love the [family=18749]COIN series[/family], the game has a tiny bit of a Euro leaning (less so than I initially thought though), and, well, the components are gorgeous. Okay, diplomacy and negotiation are a big part of the game, and that is something I often do not enjoy (EDIT for clarification: I've realized it was more the secret negotiation that was a turn-off for me). However, that doesn't mean I couldn't enjoy it, right? Ultimately, though, I found the game frustrating.

First, I never really saw how to translate what I was doing in the game into making progress toward the end goal. Sure, one of my family members became a bishop, but it ultimately did nothing for me. I never had the chance to become cardinal (never drew a Cardinal card and never had money to buy the one buyable cardinal). Really, though, that's on me, not the game. Experience with the game would change that, most likely.

Second, I don't generally mind conflict or "take that" in games, but I did get hit hard with those in this game. They were excellent plays by the player who made them and definitely helped bolster their position. However, I was stuck with a hand full of cards that did nothing to help me and very little money to operate for two turns in a row. Normally I would say that this is where I should relish the opportunity to adapt to a new situation, but I just didn't see that I could do anything but spin my wheels (again, perhaps this is related to my issue of just not seeing how to get from point A to point B in this game mentioned above). Once I recovered, I'd say the game was more or less out-of-reach. I feel like the random event cards could very easily have a similar effect.

So, where am I at with Fief? There were some fun and funny moments, and some good in-game stories. I didn't particular get interested in doing any major diplomacy, but that's no surprise. The more I think about it, luck of the draw seems huge in this game. I more or less drew the same two fortune cards all game long (the two harvest-related cards). I never saw a Cardinal card. Meanwhile, another player was able to tithe me two turns in a row. Later, when I did finally get an Assignation card and tried to assassinate that corrupt cardinal who tithed me before he was elected pope (see? good in-game stories!), he of course had two Secret Passage cards ready to play. This ultimately led to a constant feeling of helplessness. But, hey, I love card games, so who am I to moan about card draw??? In the end, I think I just have to say, I'm sorry Fief, it's not you, it's me. :D

Fantastic game of medieval diplomacy and area control.  Lots of court intrigue, battles, sieges, and unexpected twists of fate.  I just finished a book about William Marshall (the greatest knight) and I could identify with a lot of things going on in our game.  Some say there is too much chaos and swings of fortune in the game.  I don't think that's the case at all and if so, that's how it was back then.  A six player game took us less than four hours to complete - amazingly short for that many players. The expansions add a lot chrome that will keep you entertained for a long time to come.

Played 2 4-player games including all the expansions. If you expect a very strategic negotiation game, this will not be for you. It is incredibly unbalanced with massive amounts of luck. However, it is really fun to play! We enjoyed the first game very much and immediately had a rematch. 
This feels like a very thematic game, with a bit of strategy and lots of table talk mixed in.

RATING: 3
 	Songs were written on how much I wanted to love this game; and I was really OK with glossing over the fiddly "historical" rules about the complicated representative elections full of exceptions. Now I'm pretty much convinced the "War of the Roses" genre can't be streamlined enough for a single session boardgame without losing in substance and/or gaining some flaws in the process.

In theory the two competing layers of division of the territory (civil and religious), managing 4 nobles in your family with their army and marriage with other player nobles should provide for some entertaining backstab-fest. Unfortunately the game boils down to conquering a lot of land, building mills on it and snowball. And if the two most powerful players at the table seal an alliance, they can steamroll the table together and get a joint victory. All the politics of the world can't really prevent that from happening. Then it only takes the "f*** you" events randomly casting a rain of frogs on your key territory to remind you that behind the polish and the streamlining lies an 80es design that has not challenged itself for the last 30 years.

Initial reaction was disappointment that the game is only tenuously connected to what actually went on in France in 1429. Approached as a medieval-themed game rather than a treatment of any particular historical events, however, it's a nice civ-building game with a balance of military and economic means and featuring emergent alliances. I particularly like that a marriage alliance - which makes the players concerned win and lose as a team - can be broken by the simple expedient of killing husband or wife!

RATING: 4.5
It combines many elements. It features an economic base that provides money in order to buy troops (mostly), and those troops will allow you to control area majorities that will give you the temporary points you need to win as well as some powers. But there are 2 determinant factors:
-> Diplomacy: Fief relies heavily on diplomacy. Military and fortresses won't be enough to defend your frontiers.
-> Event cards: they are ultra-powerful and very difficult (next to impossible) to control.

This is what I don't like:
-> Games are too long (120 minutes is a joke).
-> Event cards are WAY too random and powerful for such a long game. They are likely to decide games (or at least, they decide who won't win).
-> The rules are quite complex; there are many things and many rules to take into account. 
-> The economic engine is very simple, and yet very important (of course, a good diplomacy is more); lovers say you can climb out of early bumps, but it is not likely and will only happen in very few games. You will wither slowly in the rest.

The production quality is quite good and the underlying rules about the religious and civil ranks, and the territory distribution (fiefs and bishoprics) are really attractive and interesting. I understand how diplomacy games fans can really love this game, but for me, they are not attractive enough to make up for the issues.

Excellent medieval themed game involving politics and land acquisition. The alliance mechanics are very well implemented as well as the opportunities for backstabbing. Game length is more palatable than most games of this type. Love the upgraded components. Definitely looking forward to getting this one out more often.

Not impressed, needs 6 players to work because of alliances, don´t try to play with less. Still with 6 players I have other conflict/negotiation games id rather play, Game of Thrones the board game as an example.

Game is also way too long with regards to playing time, because of discussions/negotiations even though the game comes with diplomacy markers to control this, it does not help.

Paulo loves 4x games, I can't stand them. But Fief is one we both love because it has the best elements of 4x and Euro games. Every part of this game is perfect: the randomness of the cards, the quickly-formed alliances between players that are just as quickly shattered in the next round, and the gradual build up of armies to the battles over (what else?) land and resources. Beyond being so superbly thematic (females aren't eligible for ecclesiastical titles and everything is ruined by plague...duh) and granting advantages to both tactical players and players who rely a little more on chance for their victories (that would be me), Fief is such a stunning accomplishment of every mechanic it employs. The center of the game is pure negotiation between players. In fact, every round starts with the possible announcement of alliances between players. Then it's the all-out battle for political offices; the totting up of votes, resources, and armies...which one of your friends will backstab you for a title that should be yours? Surrounding all this mayhem are 4x mechanics (buying units, development of territory) with Euro flair (game-stopping cards and battles being won in dice-throwing), all culminating in just three little victory points. With AP only being a hindrance in the movement round, Fief's turns for players are fast and always alter the game in a huge way, so I was constantly engaged throughout its long playtime. The rulebook and player aid may ward off a lot by its size and complexity, and that's the game's own fault, but Fief is just a fantastic addition to have on your shelf. Engaging, infuriating, and just plain brilliant, I can't wait to play Fief again.

This is a fabulous looking game, even moreso with the add-on 3D buildings and metal coins. It has some interesting game mechanics. Players agree alliances only through the marriage of their nobles - which means they can only be dissolved by obtaining a papal decree or by having a spouse killed. Some reviews dismiss Fief as feeling like a game from the 1980s. Perhaps the base game is 'behind the times' or perhaps, given the theme and title, the game in the 80s was actually more than 450 years ahead of its time.

The wild swings of luck in this game negate any planning you can do during the game.  It's just matter of who gets blind luck once they have 2 victory points, or 3 if playing as a couple, so they can grab the one more point to gain a victory.

The cards have way too strong an effect on things.  You may as well just roll dice for several hours, totaling the result and compare to other gamers as play this game.

The rules are a mess.  For a game with multiple editions, there is no excuse for all the problems with the rules.  Apparently when this version was translated, they just did a very sloppy job and created all kinds of problems.  

I've played two games of this now, about 16 hours of my life I wish I had back.

more intricate than other games of the genre,  it ultimately shares the same critical flaws: 1) bad luck early can hose you for the remaining 4 hours 2) some cards way more powerful/useful than others (critical given a hand limit of three cards), 3) the players who initiate war will lose, as will the players they attack while others build up in peace or sneak attack the palyers involved in war and lastly 4) ultimately devolves into dogpiling of a player about to win.

A fascinating, if convoluted experience.
Very difficult to get your head around all the rules initially, and the visual design doesn't help one bit.

However, the ideas here are very intriguing.  I love the bishopric voting politics layered over area control and family management.  
It's disappointing then that the game is so dependent on random card draw and dice rolling for virtually every action. Cunning player tactics and guile often become moot in the face of an unfortunate top deck, or unlucky dice.

I've had two plays with people who know the rules well (as of 10 May 2015).

Some players will absolutely love this. You could think of it as a more in-your-face, swingy and evocative Game of Thrones.

After the game, you might be really excited or you might feel you wasted hours where you had too little control.

The map/board is extremely tight and claustrophobic, which is fun. It instantly creates a lot of amusing arguments and begging about leaving your borders alone etc.

Persuasion is a big part of the game and it contributes to great stories around failed alliances, marriages, sudden changes of power, rapid escalation, huge misfortune etc. You have a ton of options for hooking-up with other players on the board, providing mutual support etc. It's not a dull 'simulation' game but it greatly simulates the chaos and happenstance of real ife ... perhaps too much!

There are a lot of nasty 'event cards' which randomly affect particular players/regions. Players also get random action cards that are quite potent and can be played at any time to completely overturn an enemy's strategy. And there are a lot of relatively 50/50 decisions about whether or not to militarily smash an opponent virtually out of contention. Players may either love or hate that.

It's as if (the otherwise dissimilar) Cosmic Encounter has invaded a strategy game. It makes it extremely hard to plan. But unlike Cosmic Encounter, there's no big catch-up mechanism in Fief. If you become weak in Fief you become a target.

The game can run long. Last night's was 4+ hours with 6 players and would have lasted longer if I'd made a different decision near the end. It can take forever for your turn to come. In both games that I've played there were players who eventually wanted the game to end when it became apparent that they were losing and had little to do.

Despite that, it's true that a flash of devious brilliance can win you the game. You'll be plotting furiously and will probably feel really engaged with it, provided you're not feeling out of contention. It's possible to 'chain together' a clever succession of promotions (which earn you victor points and upgrades), although it still depends a lot on the chaos of other players' choices/cards.

If you think you might like it, do try it - it could be your favourite game ever. And I heard the expansions for it are good.

For me, I think I prefer games like the first edition of A Study In Emerald - which provides some of the same interaction, deception, stories, land-grabbing, clever forced game endings etc but in a much shorter timeframe and with more control ... albeit being less 'epic'.

Fazit meiner Rezension:
„Fief“ ist eine unausgegorene Mischung aus „Risk“ und „Diplomacy“ mit verschärftem Glücksfaktor, umständlichen Regeln und oftmals zu langer Spieldauer. Wer ein Spiel mit ähnlichen Mechanismen, aber in jeder Hinsicht besser austariertem Regelwerk und höherem strategischen Anspruch sucht, kann im Fantasy-Genre und hier bei „Warparty“ (Lock ‘n Load Publishing, 2013) fündig werden. Geschichtsinteressierte sollten „Fief - France 1429“ meiden.

RATING: 5
Has two interesting ideas: 

1. It's an area control game in which each city belongs to two different areas: both a bishopric and a fiefdom.

2. Players compete for titles that confer various benefits.

But, the randomness of the events make long-term planning nonviable.

It seems like this one is a hit; I'm certainly sold. It's a bit of an odd duck in our group, since it shows its age by offering a more player-elimination style of game, but the 'story' opportunity if provides along with very pleasant mechanics make for a great time. The game itself certainly has plenty of blemishes, notably in the vague ruleset, but it is very worthwhile despite those problems. Just make sure that the game is only played amongst those with the maturity level to handle 'warm diplomacy'!

RATING: 8
07-03-2015. Rated after 1 play. Very confusing game. Basically, Fief is an area control game with several layers of area control. There are Fiefs (worldly parts of land), and bishoprics (ecclesiastical).

You work to get 3 VPs by controlling Fiefs, being the King or Pope. You do this by gathering income (mills), you build fortifications in controlled Fiefs and get titles (Fief titles, Bishhops/cardinals/pope and lastly King/Queen and heir) for your family of nobles. The interesting thing is, that you when you marry a female figure of another family, you have an alliance with the player requiring you to have 4 shared VPs for the win.But if your spouse dies, your alliance is over..

What ruins the game for me a little bit is the card system. Each turn you can get a noble, an event card. In addition, disaster cards are intermixed which are resolved in a random area and the effects can be devastating. That may be thematic.. but it's swingy. The game is quite long, but the cards can really flip screw a couple of players over.. and if you play a 2p game and you hit an important bishopric that is shared between partners.. you just won the game by random chance. Meeh..

RATING: 1
I do not understand why the rating of this game is so high. It is extremely long, which is something I don't usually mind if you are doing some heavy thinking and are able to build a long term strategy. In This game your strategy can be wiped out with a single card and if you draw all women lords at the beginning of the game you cannot win, all you can do is team up with another player and hope that you can both win. So you are forced to sit at the table without any options which is fine if the game is only an hour but at three hours that is not acceptable. There are many cards that are so random and powerful that any strategy you have built up in the 2 hours of playing gets wiped out in seconds. I must say that I sabatoaged the game because there was nothing that I could do and I was having a horrible time, Any game that even allows me to do that is a very bad design.  Please someone tell me what I am missing because this game seems to me broken.

FUN ★★★★✰
I played it a lot back in the early 90's. I purchased this new edition and had only one play with 3 friends. It was good even though some players can get angry from seeing alliances being made without them, or their alliances being betrayed. Be prepared also to spend 6-8 hours of play!

RULES ★★★✰✰
Rules are dense but clear enough and easy to find in case of doubt. Yuu could need one or two sessions before being sure to play it without mistake unless you take several breaks to check out the rules.

IMMERSION ★★★★★
This is what I like in this game: it tells you a story that you take part in. There are alliances, wars, marriages, elections, and all that togather gives you the feeling that you are living a medieval adventure. Something that you are going to remember for a long time.

DEPTH ★★★★✰
Once the rules are known and participants agree to the fact that there can be treasons, you will want to play very often, each play being quite different from the other ones.

Positively received in my family apart from my euro-biased wife who rates this as a six out of ten. Think it may be a while before it hits the table again though due to the three to four hours you need to play it, but it's a worthwhile time investment and you will walk away with a strong narrative about what happened in the game. I love that aspect. Now if you want a REALLY long game, try Blood Royale!

RATING: 9.5
Owned Fief 2012 edition. Sort of cross-over between A Game of Thrones 2nd edition and Diplomacy, with a playtime well doable in one evening. Absolutely fantastic game.

Kickstarted Fief: France 1429 as this is a re-issue with better components (map + miniatures), plus a lot of expansions.

Can't wait.

[FEB 2015] "Are you as good as they say you are?" You bet. Brilliant game. We played with the traits from the Politics expansion(quite amusing and recommended) and other than that, nothing but base and the relics option. We didn't like the relics, so we will be dropping those next time. But we will try out the full Tactics expansion as we do like to have our Diplomacy at the edge of a sharpened sword (or bow, for that matter)...

[MAR 2015] Played without the relics, with the full Tactics and Politics expansions. The advisors seem to be a bit unbalanced, so I don't think we'll break them out soon again. The traits keep being superb, can't think of playing without them. As for the tactics: Mercenaries add unnecessary complexity to the game and we can do without. Archers are a great addition, really pack a punch and allow an army to go offensive on the countryside. Bombardiers seemed expensive and were in effect almost not used. Royal Guards are a very flavourable touch without added complexity so we'll keep that in as well. Both are nice additions, we'll definitely keep playing with them.

Advice for best experience so far: Base + Politics + Tactics, leave out Relics (Base), Advisors (Politics exp) and Mercenaries (Tactics exp). Also, we play with the original rules on Assassination: no die roll, it automatically succeeds (but you can use Secret Passage to get away if needed). Better and faster.

Depends a lot on how you play it. If you play it as a straight up euro/engine building game doing your own thing, than its not that good. If you play as an almost rpg/ medieval lord simulator, talking, making deals, promises and scheming. Than its a good game.

Geez.  I expected to quite like this game, but it is a dinosaur of a design that I can't imagine has been modernized much if at all in its iterations over the past 35 years.  But even its early 80s heritage isn't an excuse, considering AH released the classic Dune in 1979 and, untouched, that one doesn't feel dated at all.  I'm very surprised considering the other titles I've tried by Academy Games have been so refined and streamlined.

There are several design quirks that killed it for me:
- it is hugely luck-dependent (especially the negative event cards that show up in random locations), with many of those turns of fate extending the length of the game;
- there is no game clock, so a game can go on indefinitely;
- the niggling rules are full of esoteric terminology, making the game more difficult to learn than it should be;
- the game never became internalized or natural to any of the players so there were constant references to the rulebook and reference sheets;
- voting was much more awkward than in any other game I've played;
- apart from victory conditions, negotiation and alliances are fairly negligible because there are no in-game benefits to them.

Having said all that, I did have fun playing Fief -- after all, it's hard not to have fun playing a conflict-heavy diplomatic war game with people into that genre -- but it was fun had more in spite of the design than because of it.  If I had never played games like Dune, A Game of Thrones, or Dominant Species, some of these issues might not have bothered me as much.  But I have played those games, and would continue to opt for them over Fief if given the choice.  Thus the low rating.

I could rate this a 5 or a 10 depending on my mood. There are so many things I love about Fief, and so many things I hate. Sometimes even the same things. It excels at telling a compelling story, though when that story is about a king dying of plague, it's the sort of story I'd rather be told about the other guy's king.

I was so hopeful, and this game is so awful.

The rules, oh god the rules. My least favorite thing in any game is when there are little edge-case rules that you have to remember at all times. Well this is Little Edge-Case Rules That You Have to Remember All the Time: The Board Game. If you move through an enemy army you do this, if you move through an enemy noble you do that. When checking to see if there's an election do this, but that character can't vote because of that. If a character dies you do this, but if they had a certain title you do that. And there's way, way more. Plus I didn't even play with the expansions, so there's a whole new level of fiddly rules to remember. There's even a card (the secret passage card) that has about eight different functions depending on when you use it, but there are NO symbols or text on the card. So just keep checking the rulebook constantly to see if you can use the card for a particular situation.

Oh, and the randomness. Want to get most of your characters eliminated because of a purely random dice roll? Well meet the Plague card. Yep, you can be basically eliminated from the game based on pure chance with no way to mitigate it. Not only that, but a lot of the game is dependent on getting lucky with your card draws. If you draw a lot of women from the deck then you don't have much of a chance (the women cards are very limited on what they can do).

This game seemed really neat. I backed it on Kickstarter because of how neat it seemed. The way the game uses elections is unique, the alliances are really cool, and the combat system is well-done. Unfortunately all of the other issues overshadow the good, leaving a mess of a game that devolves into pure luck-of-the-draw and dice rolling mixed with constantly having to dig through the rulebook. Really bad, and the first big failure I've played from Academy Games. Hopefully they'll do better next time.

Sold.

Very Luck based, Most of the Attack cards and event cards are overpowered and or random.

Very long with messy rules

It's very thematic, but with much randomness, wobbly rules that sometimes need to be interpreted on the fly, and with lots of diplomacy and betrayal. If you can bear those things, it's a great game that gives us stories we still refer back to *years* later.

Extremely thematic, with the period feel built in the mechanisms, and not just added as chrome. It is reasonably fast, and quite chaotic.

I really like this for the theme and the look of the board, but it seems to finish too quickly - not in amount of time, but in number of turns. The design favours military action and armies can get ridiculously large, IMO. The winner is decided by a couple of big battles that also bring the political balance to a head - not altogether unrealistic, but it seems to be over almost before it really gets started. I wish there were a way to tone down the volatility and somewhat reduce the reliance on military forces so I could enjoy more of the political manoeuvering.

Only one play. I get the impression that the game has too much luck involved (the game play didn't help) with some things I dislike. I have to play it again...

This game is a throwback to another era where folks had 3-4+ hours to totally emerge in a system of scheming, alliances, deal making and backstabbing. Is that player you married a trusty ally or twisty mustached double-crosser? I wouldn't play this with AP prone players. The elections could be streamlined. But ultimately Fief is a rewarding gaming experience.

I love everything about this game — the negotiation, the backstabbing, the area control, the fog of war, all of it.

It's exactly what I want a board game to be.

I should have liked this more than I did. The decision to use a weird, imaginary map instead of one of France is kind of bizarre. I'd like to know why they made that decision. Perhaps I take away more points for that than is warranted. Ultimately, it's a little more simplistic and abstracted than other games of this form that I prefer while also being longer and more complicated than I'd want out of a game on the lighter end of the scale.

[Kickstarter edition] A very good diplomatic/combat game, which has however some drawbacks:
1) random events that are REALLY random, and which exacerbate the luck which is already present in the form of the cards and the dice;
2) the rules are quite messy and not at all intuitive.

A great negotiation game, very thematic and really simple in terms of rules. Chit-chat, backstabbing and a little bit of strategy to win. It takes too long, never ending if the game gets to a balance point where everybody needs just one point but nobody knows how to get it.

What a great 3x game. Battles work in a streamlined fun way and there are plenty of opportunities for screwage and sneaky moves. Modular expansions add some nice changes and asymmetry.

The play experience, and systems, that [i]Game of Thrones 2nd edition[/i] should have been. Fief is the game that fired [i]Blood Royale[/i] and GoT.

HOUSE RULE: With 4 players, you can only win solo (marriages occur, of course, but do not ally players).

My preference is to only play the game with 5 or 6 players, and use almost none of the expansions (I like the longbowmen, bu that's about it).

I want my four hours back. I was excited to play the game after seeing such well constructed components. You assume when such thought goes into creating the look of the game, the rules would follow suit; however this was not the case. The randomness ruined the game in my opinion and made the decisions irrelevant to the outcome of the game. This amount of randomness is not acceptable in a game that lasts as long as this.

Yes, I was looking for this game since the beginning of my gaming days - that's exactly it. Highly thematic politics/diplomacy game that just opens itself for roleplaying style gaming sessions. Effectively replaces Here I Stand for me due to lesser demands (playable in 2,5 hours with 4 players), although I would never trade HIS away.
Absolutely an overlooked masterpiece.

Grand strategy game best with a full compliment of players.  Multiple ways to win (and lose!) means you really have to pay attention to everyone's moves.  Unique aspect of being able to win by aligning with another player.  Random events every round can have no effect, or literally completely change the game.  While this is a downside to some games, it fits with the theme and time period well (you'll just have to try it to understand what I mean).

First game: 4 hours with 5 players. A lot of game-deciding randomness that can't often be mitigated; not much sense of strategy to it.

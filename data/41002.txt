Essen purchase. The game is a BEAUTIFUL production and has some interesting game mechanics (priority turn order and action price). The game left me kind of flat, as the special character mechanics are a bit confusing for me. Once that gets cleared up further, this should improve with subsequent plays.

Vasco is a solid worker placement game. While nothing here is phenomenally new, it is one of the best in the genre that I have played. There are a lot of neat timing elements here coupled with some good special powers and money management. I think the action order thing is great and is really what makes the game for me, even if I usually do screw it up somehow. I hope to keep playing this one.

Bei dem Spiel habe ich nur 15min zugeschaut und es mir dabei kurz erklären lassen. Es sah echt gut aus und machte auch strategisch etwas her. Bei der Spielmesse in Essen war es am Samstag auf Platz 1 gewählt. Ich denke soviele Leute können sich nicht irren, deshalb gebe ich mal blind die Note 8, da ich ja auch einen Eindruck gewonnen habe.

The systems are tight and easy to understand, but the strategy is unique to me - something I want to continue to explore. It isn't just the novelty of the worker placement resolution (which I do enjoy). It's also the shipping system - which offers up a surprising number of options and opportunities for planning. And wow, it plays very fast. Great game!

Yeah, this one's pretty bland. Generic crew types that (for some abstract and arbitrary reason) you need to collect sets for. A "punishing" action selection mechanism that isn't all that punishing in the end (at worst you pay three more than you expect; money's tight, but this isn't a brutal thing). Fiddly to a fault ... I don't mind fiddly setup but there has to be a payoff (Agricola, say). This is just agonizing (sort of like Endeavor where, at least with fewer players, you're laying many tokens that nobody's going to claim). Abstract and sort of nonsensical ship navigation rules and reward structure. Etc. Simply, not something I'm eager to explore.

May 2011:  Great "wind it up" then unwind it worker placement mechanic.  Need to play more to arrive at a more definitive opinion.  On the first play, I would give it an 8 for its novel "wind it up" then unwind it mechanism, which is fun to play with.

December 2011.  Downgraded to a 7 because, the decisive shipping expedition/sailing mechanism on the left side of the board is not particularly comprehensible or enjoyable (this after trying to "get into it" after 2 plays) and somewhat fiddly.  

If the shipping expedition/sailing mechanism (which I have been told by experienced Vasco players takes MANY plays to wrap your mind around) eludes your understanding, and hence interest, the game devolves into a feeling of "rinse and repeat" which after an hour of play, feels boring. I love the "wind it up" mechanism, but this alone, cannot carry the game after two plays.  In the final analysis, I am not sure I have the patience to finally, eventually, understand an expedition/sailing mechanism that I do not find compelling.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really don't understand the criticism concerning this title. In my opinion this is one of the best euro-games I've played. Every action you do is related to one another and the gameplay is very focused (to the goal of sending the right ships at the right time to the right harbours). There is very little downtime and time just flies by playing this. It works very well with all player counts and the turn/action selection mechanism is great and allows for a cunning strategizing. All the actions also make sense and are very well balanced, as is the game in general. There is also a good deal of player interaction to be found in the Navigation area strategies. The theme although admittedly somewhat abstract is there and is much better implemented than in many euro-style games where victory points salad is the main course of the meal (you are a ship owner looking for glory after all, not an explorer). In short, a great game that is sadly underappreciated.

Fun factor: 4/5
Strategy vs. luck: 5/5

The game has a feel that reminds me a bit of an Ystari title with the different sections of the board all interacting to drive the player's score.  The turn order selection method feels new (but may not be) while the remaining parts have a proven feel to them.  Despite this the game does have a strange clunky feel.  Not a bad feel, just something a bit bumpy.  Perhaps its the way the game moves around the board sections or the odd rules surrounding the special roles.  Even so, the result at the end of the day is a very nice game that should appeal to gamers.  Likely not approachable for casual family gaming but well within reach of hobby gamers.

RATING: 7
I was surprised at how well this game worked with all the mechanics there are operating in a turn. I am particularly impressed by the need to balance the order of actions you need to take to do what you want with how much money you have and how you are going to take the actions before your opponents. Some challenging decisions here. Probably will go up with more plays, though it might get stale after a few plays.

Very interesting action order mechanic which is really what makes the game shine. Otherwise, it just feels like your run of the mill euro.

The way we played, the merchant ship character seemed overly strong (but we might have gotten some rule wrong...)

RATING: 7
The board was nice and good art but seemed tight, jumbled, and chaotic. I think they where trying to fit a certain size.Playing pieces where OK. Played with only 3 so not sure how a fourth would change the game. The real tension is when the starting point adjustment occurs. The real key is to get the most hight numbered fleets launched and have the most ships in the last row.Would like to play again to try other actions. Won on the lat turn by a huge margin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Really enjoying this one.  There's more tension in your action selection (the Numbers) than you might expect, and that tension just gets ratcheted up the deeper you go into a game.  The moderate uncertainty of which number starts getting a free action has a bigger effect than is obvious from a simple perusal of the rules, encouraging a "high risk, high reward" system.

I think it's significantly lighter than the consensus and takes less time than advertised.  The box says 12 and up, 60-120 minutes, but we just finished a 3-player game with my 8-year-old son in about 50 minutes.

I don't see why this got so much hate from Mr. Vassel when there are easily so many more games that are worse it terms of euroy soulesssness. It actually a pretty simple design focused on some simple risk-taking, and does feel thematic at some level.

Elsőre 9 pontot adok, de talán még feljebb is mehet! Zseniális, szerintem közel Goa szintű az, ahogy össze vannak rakva az egymásra épülő akciók. A játéktér mind az 5 eleme tartalmaz eredeti ötleteket, nekem a legjobban az akcióválasztó mechanizmus tetszik, bár épp ezen a részen elég nagy a szerencse szerepe. A szabály alapján már látszott, hogy nem egy könnyű darab, szerintem nagyon sok idő elmehet agyalással, szóval jól meg kell gondolni, kivel ülünk neki:) Bármikor játszanék még vele.

The mechanic of risk management at the core of the game is rather unusual and also very elegant. Vasco da Gama is a true gamer's game: players need to plan ahead very carefully for every worker they place, weighing the risks of not having money against the risks of going after the other players. Very good game!

RATING: 6
Vasco is yet another worker placement game.  It's not the next Caylus, Agricola or Le Havre, but it's certainly better than Pillars of the Earth and almost all of the other WP games out there.

As for gameplay, I enjoy that you have to consider the timing of each of your actions in relation to the other players as well as yourself, especially if you plan to launch ships that round.  There is a risk element that can potentially make or break the game.  This is something that I am not a fan of in efficiency games, but since it's THE unique thing about Vasco, I'm not going to even suggest any tweaking.  Players can mitigate the risk by either always selecting a higher number or always having enough money available to afford the risk.

I also enjoy the landing and navigating of ships.  It's fun to watch the ships move up the board.  The use of the influential character, Girolamo Sernigi "the Merchant" can really muck up another player's plans for ship movement.  One of my fellow gamers dubbed Girolamo "the Mucker."  Unfortunately. the other influential characters are not nearly as interesting.

First play: I give this an enthusiastic 8 and expect this to rise with more plays. Although the basic mechanic is worker placement, the turn order element is a stroke of genius where the order of moves balanced against the need to accumulate cash to fund ventures makes for some knife edge decisions.

Screwage is subtle but can be brutal.

Its so nice to play a new game that makes such a great impression. Really looking forward to future plays.

Thinky (might be too thinky for casual gamers) worker placement game with a twist. Not only do you have to choose the right actions, you also have to make sure you plan them in the right order and are able to pay for them. The action selection mechanics and the navigation rules make this a very original game. Good planning and some risk management are the prerequisites to do wel at this game. Only bad thing that sticks out is that it seems there are very few strategies leading to victory. This might result in less replayability. For now I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt with regard to replay value. Theme is pretty pasted on, allthough it did not annoy me as much as it does with other themeless Euros. Solid Euro with some very nice new ideas. Highly recommended.

An OK game, works well enough. Would be happy to play again. However, nothing leapt out and grabbed me. There are plenty of other decent games out there and nothing about this one pushes it up the pile of games I want to play.

Very interesting game.  Lots to mull over and work for.  Like some of the other newer worker placement games I've played, they are good but I'm not quite sure if they will break into anything more than the occasional play.  The theme doesn't really mesh with this one.  I enjoy the turn order drafting.  That seems like it could be the heart of the game.  I did only play with two as I think more would make this more involved.  Rating at a 7 until I play it more.

Nov 2013 - played again, this time with four.  MUCH better.  The navigational phase becomes tight and tough choices on what you need and how soon you have to get it in turn order.  Money is big in this one...and it's tight. Bumped to a 7.5

Great strategy game with a worker placement plus prority of action selection mechanism. The scoring and movement of the ships is also very clever. There are quite a few agonizing and important decisions to make. Beautiful artwork und quality components. The only downside is the randomness of the tile draw that determines how much you will have to pay for the actions you selected. This can make or break your game and can only be mitigated by extremely safe play.

Nothing wrong with this game - just a very typical, very dull worker placement euro. There is no development really (other than your ships advancing, or not ...) each turn is the same as the previous one, and the theme does nothing for me. Mechanically it works and is quite clever with various systems - but nothing in the game made me feel engaged with the theme. I lost interest about half way through and was glad when it was over. I'm sure you can analyse it, optimise your placement, be clever with what value to take for each etc, but I couldn't be bothered - felt more like work than fun.

I'd probably play again if pressured, but no desire to seek it out.

*** Update, scratch that - got pressured to play it again and now I'd probably NOT play it again. Nothing wrong with the game so I can't really rate it a '3', other than I just don't like it!

*** Update, again pressured into playing this .. and was bored senseless - I have no interest in the game at all, no connection to the theme and it just felt like work combined with an arbitary 'push your luck' mechanic for the hell of it. Never want to play this again ... I play games for entertainment, this doesn't work for me at all, dropped rating to a 3.

Juego de colocación de trabajadores con un curioso e innovador sistema de elección de acciones. Hay una parrilla de 20 numeros y uno será el número inicial. Cuando escoges una acción eliges un número y lo colocas junto con tu marcador de acción en la acción deseada. Cuando ha colocado todo el mundo, se añade un modifiacar el número inicial. Aquellas acciones que tengan número menor que el inicial deben pagar la diferencia para poder llevarse a cabo... el resto sale gratis.
Las acciones pueden ser: Escoger marineros/capitanes = tripulación, escoger proyectos de navegación, hospedar a un personaje (cada uno hace una cosa = roles) y enviar expediciones a navegar.
Son cinco turnos, en cada turno se colocan trabajdores, se resuelven acciones y se navega. El que más puntos consiga (se consiguen al navegar principalemnte) es el que gana.

Muy entretenido y con varias formas de ganar. Encajan muy bien las mecánicas presentes y me ha parecido un juegazo. Derechito a mi wishlist.

Demomento solo lo he probado a 2 (admite hasta cuatro) y funciona perfecto.

2nd game with 4 players normal map. Grade up to 8. Could go up maximum to an 8,5. Maybe a bit long but not repetitive.

Initial rating based on one play at Essen 2009.

Yet another worker placement game. There are a few twists but nothing that grabs. Nothing apparently wrong but nothing too new to offer in a very crowded genre. Seemed a bit finicky, fiddly and mechanical from my first play.

Update. The replay was more interesting and seemed less fiddly and some cleverness. Lots of planning. I can't seem to wrap my head around this one. It seems like this will be my nemesis. Will occasionally play in the future.

An absolute brain burner to play well, I suspect.

This is a game that highly rewards planning and timing, and timing your planning and planning your timing.   In this manner it feels similar to games like Leonardo de Vinci.   

Initial role distribution isn't entirely fair, with some being a lot more useful than others.

Vasco is great - and most of the greatness comes from both the novelty and tightness of the design.

This game has a number of unique mechanisms, most notably the order bidding system which lets you press your luck on how much taking an early action will cost.  There are four areas on the board that can be activated, but what is refreshing is that the actions you take (normally 4) are taken in the order you bought for them, regardless of where they are placed.  When I first saw the game, I thought the board would be too open and easy, as there are 3 spots per area to be claimed in the 2er.  What becomes apparent, though, is that one action per area is almost never enough to accomplish anything - indeed, this is one of those games where you never feel like you've got enough actions, or sequenced them well enough, to be where you'd like to be.

There is nothing wasted in this game.  Unlike many games with role selection, where the mechanic seems quite tacked-on, in Vasco the roles are vital to good play, and do things that are very necessary for the game to function.  The limits in this one are quite impressive, and make for a very competitive 2er.

So, yes, if the game has legs like I imagine, it will be my pick for best Euro from Essen 2009, maybe best Euro of the year.  My only quibble, thus far, has been in the scoring.  We've had two ties, and the other two games were within 3 points of each other.  While in some respects this might be good (as it shows the game is balanced) it also makes me fear that, for all the seeming variety, the game plays itself.  I'm hoping this is not the case (I doubt it is) but only further plays will tell if this one has staying power.  Right now, though, it is very, very good.

More worker placement, but this time the players select the order of resolution with earlier turns potentially costing more. There's very little luck, but a good dose of randomness as players before you can take away your first choice. Managing this chaos is where the skill lies (I believe).

This is very appealing - essentially worker placement to get ships and crew to send on voyages to score but with a nice semi-bidding mechanism underpinning the priority for actions and tough choices every turn on how you should use your limited actions.  More please.

On second play I still have problems grasping the interaction and getting my choices right - that may be a good thing in terms of challenge or, perhaps, is an indication that this game simply isn't for me.  The jury is out until I play again.

RATING: 7
Another take on worker placement that puts enough twists in to make it interesting.  In this one, players must select a turn order to accompany their worker, selecting anywhere from action 1 to action 20.  Action 1 is always performed first, and so on all the way to action 20.  However, taking a low number also means you'll likely have to pay extra money for that early action, with the payment amount not set in stone until all actions have been selected.  This creates a pretty cool push-your-luck type situation, as you often want to go before someone else, but aren't sure if you can get away with picking that low number or not.

Other than that twist, it becomes a fairly standard worker placement game, with workers claiming ships, hiring people to build the ships and captains to sail them, etc.  The goal is to get ships onto the open sea where they score you points.

Overall, a great and fairly tense twist on worker placement if you're into that sort of thing, which I am!

Updated 5/12/10.  

Early on, Vasco da Gama was my runaway leader for game of the year.  In the intervening months, it has dropped a little for me, but it is still my highest-rated game from Essen 2009. 

The pros: This is a fantastic game.  It is clean, fast, interesting, and accessible.  Very much in the mold of Puerto Rico, but with better artwork and components.  Although one of the common complaints is that the game's mechanics are not particularly novel, I think that comes from novice players who aren't maximizing the turn selection phase.  This should be more than a simple sequential worker placement exercise: particularly with two, each round becomes like a mini game of Battle Line, with one player opening, foreshadowing a strategy, and the second player responding either passively or aggressively, trumping or avoiding, trapping or racing out to claim their desired spots. 

So where has the game been falling flat lately?  After many plays, it seems to lack the depth of truly elite, strategic game.  With only a few resources to manage (money and actions, essentially), and without the ability to build a personal production engine, the game is almost entirely about efficiency and timing.  That may be oversimplifying a bit, but at times it does feel like a game of opportunism.  

Great game with a few minor drawbacks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
You choose four micro actions per turn, competing for turn order, attempting to stay one step ahead of your competition. 

Not really worker placement because you take turn initiative disk from a central pool of turn order disks.

A good simulation of time and money.  Well crafted, intelligent game system.

The voyages are abstracted more than I like.  Why do ships disappear as go up the coast?  Only dersign issue is the voyages.  

The tiny captain pawns are almost a deal breaker.  It is the smallest game piece I have ever seen.

Yeah, OK. It's yet another worker placement Euro. But this one does have some cool twists. The turn order is the heart of the game, and it's unique and fun. The game plays pretty fast for a meaty game too. Slight problem with runaway leader, but other than that, I liked it. 

To me, the rules are very streamlined - buy boats, buy sailors and captains to man the boats, buy 1 of the 5 specialists, and sail the boats. That's it. But managing all of the timing elements is tricky, and driven by the awesome turn order draft.

I really enjoy worker placement games so this was a good one to try out for me. I'm not entirely sold on the unique twist of pushing you luck with the execution order of your workers, but it's not bad either. I really do love the whole navigation mechanic and how it works.  And having special role powers is a bonus. Rating could go up with more plays.

I enjoyed the game's novelties, namely the push your luck worker placement bit and the bumping ships mechanism, which are terribly clever. Beyond that, I didn't manage to find an engaging game though, as the rest of the game was vanilla and not terribly interesting. The worker placement sequences were mostly forced, and there seems to be a dominant strategy of scoring the higher level navigation slots.
A fair effort, but not something I wish to play again.

+ the bumping ships and the push your luck worker placement mechanisms
+ easy to teach and quick to play
+ works equally well with 2-4 players
+ solid components and great art

= some screwage, not a multiplayer solitaire
= the push your luck element might put some euro-gamers off

- the game feels less than its parts
- possibly a dominant strategy

New game with a very interesting turn order mechanic. I got screwed a bunch by the random element, but I was sort of pushing the envelope, so I deserved it. Took us a while to get through the rulebook, but the game played easily enough that I could probably teach it from memory. Play is nice and fast. It reminds me of a slightly less elegant, but more sophisticated version of Vikings. I dig it.

VdG is a worker placement game with one major new twist, the workers are discs and the order that they execute their chosen actions in is dictated by an order drafting mechanic where going earlier in the order is almost always desirable, but where getting greedy and going too far ahead in the order can create a lot of extra money expenses.

Workers are placed to gain ships, crew, captains, and the ability to sail. Boats each require some mix of crew, which come in several colours, as well as a captain. Players take some time to build up an appropriate crew to man the ship tile they drafted and then send it to the colonies, where they will usually get a short term benefit (crew, captain, new map, money) and sometimes a longer term one (i.e.: coins every start phase). There are 6 rows that can each hold a finite number of ships, once a row is complete, the boats there collect VPs for their owners, and then try to move up to the next tier. They move up in order based on the number in the top right corner of the tile, in general, higher number tiles require more crew to man. If there aren't spots available in the next row that they can legally be placed in, they disappear. If there is, they fill it, and will be able to score again when the new row is filled up. There are a couple of other niggly details due to the special powers (which are also claimed via worker placement) but that's the game in a nutshell.

This is a short, lighter weight game that doesn't have anything new to offer aside from the order drafting mechanic, and I'm amazed that this is getting anything other than average ratings. There's nothing wrong with the game, but I don't see how it is standing out in any appreciable way, as it is mostly a cookie-cutter type release. There's no room for a big play or real creativity, it's just a case of gather guys, get a ship, send it over, and try to wheedle the best position possible for your boat. There is a bit of room for nasty play with the merchant ship mechanic, but overall this is just too sedate and derivative to impress me as anything other than dead average.

On the +++ side :

Very good ideas to refresh the caylus-like games : 

hinding auction mechanism for turn order+actions :
a provisionnal price is determined, you choose your actions in order : the sooner the more expensive it will be, then the price is adjusted (-3/+3 range) : you will have perhaps some actions to cancel if you attend to do lots of actions earlier without enough money to pay for all of them...

expeditions :
the faster you lanch boats , more "wages" you earn. but you should also launch big boats as they can go on several landings before going back home !

the 4 special roles to adjust your moves are well implemented to the game

On the - - -  side :
it is very processionnal with 16 actions * 5 rounds to go on
the 2.5 hours last the game seems longer

---
I quite liked my 1 play so far. Very little luck. I'm getting kinda "worker placement"'d out, but I still didn't mind it here. You don't know exactly what you're going to do with your worker until it resolves. You also don't know [i]exactly[i] which actions will be free, and which will cost. There's sort of like an "automatic" Provost (from Caylus) here that will shift the point where "free" is after everyone has placed their markers. Workers that are not free cost according to how far behind the provost (or whatever it is called) they are. The game has a pretty natural flow: get sailors, a captain, buy a ship, and then sail it. Ship better/more boats and you generally win. An interesting twist is that the order workers get resolved is not player order nor fixed by the board, but rather when a worker is placed, you pick up an available number (1-20) and put it with your worker, and they get resolved in that order. I also like the jostling among sailed ships to both move up (to score again) or to die.

Vasco da Gama is a worker placement game with a major twist: it's not really about picking a particular action out of many, but rather about timing them in such an order that you have everything working together without delays while at the same time disrupting the plans of other players. The game introduces some uncertainty of its own here, too: by slowly fluctuating the point from which onwards actions are free (or from which before actions cost money) players are asked to take a gamble or to provide some means of insurance in terms of money to help them if this proves necessary. The actions themselves are fairly simply things with the exception of the shipping. Timing everything correctly here puts me in mind of a clockwork of sorts. I cannot shake the feeling that the core of the game takes place on about a quart of the main game board: the rest is all support!

In a trial game I made two very stupid errors which put me out of the game about halfway; I declined to take useful actions thereafter and just collected money instead. (I simply don't like playing for last place.) It did give me an opportunity to just watch the game closely. Timing is very important to the extent that things can become somewhat chaotic; often a shortage of money is your own worst enemy as you may not feel sufficiently secure to take an early action simply because you can't afford it. As such the game appears very finished with little unnecessary extras, and I think that is definitely a Good Thing™. I'm not sure whether or not I would want to purchase this title, though. The game feels a little too chaotic to my liking. That said, a rematch is not something I would say no to, either.

[b]Update[/b] A rematch I asked, and a rematch I got. I stick to my previously written sentiment that this title harbours something chaotic which may or may not help or hinder you. Or perhaps chaotic is not the right word: it's more, as I already said before, that Vasco da Gama is a game of quite precise timing. For the basic actions like acquiring crew, captains and ships you need money, so here it's a question of money first and parts second. No money means not taking risks, lots of money means simply buying your way into doing what you want. For actual shipping you need to guesstimate how the harbours are going to be filled up, which is not easy as you need to guesstimate how your opponents are going to react and in what order. If you get it wrong, a strong ship may be taken out of the game rather prematurely. If you get it very right, you'll likely receive a great deal of points. There is a sense of ... friction ... here in that something very important, victory points, is partly moved outside of your control.

Another thing I noted is that the game itself is rather processional. You get crew and ships, you set sail, you get rewards. In the meantime keep up your coffers. Rinse, and repeat for a few times. That's not much to go on if you're in for many repeat plays, unless, of course, you happen to like the timing aspect which is indeed quite unusual. For me the scales unfortunately point to a desire for somewhat more control and somewhat more diversity than Vasco da Gama offers. I'll leave the rating at a 6 as a token of recognition of the core mechanism; but I'm not as eager to play this game as my other sixes.

Vasel at his best with this review and Shadow Era. Used to like these guy, the more you watch the meltdowns the more MEH. Time for Dice Tower to move on with new hosts. 

"It's an exciting theme for somebody in the world but not for most of us". So you speak for the majority? This is the reason the U.S. was created as a Republic not a Democracy as many people think. In a Democracy controlled by a majority the minorities only get "rights" at the whim of the majority.  Leave me out of your "but not for most of us".

Not everyone has the Dice Tower reviewer's seemly unlimited disposal income, or is that access to free games given to you. There in lies the problem.

Bitching  you have seen a theme 10,000 times before, neatly ignores that many of us will never play, let alone own, the games the reviewer has thrown away. I have played very few renaissance games, I am not burned out on them.

To bitch and moan constantly over and over on this point of reused themes is tiring and seems somewhat inconsistent with Dice Tower. How many times has the space theme been done? We hear no complaints about that, especially if dice are involved.

Why not complain about the rehash Yahtzee games that get such glowing reviews out of Dice Tower based on what seems to be nothing more then a dice fetish, Elder Sign comes to mind. A rehash, over and over of that Lovecraft stuff, when do we have enough of that? Only when Dice Tower has had enough it would seem, they speak for the majority.

It's a nice twist for worker placement mechanism. As usual, worker placement are used to fill slot of available actions, but additional from that, you also need to determine the timing when the said actions will be resolved. 

The thing is, it's somehow chaotic during the nature of randomization. You could have strategies, but you need to cross your finger for that. A nice break from heavy analytical games. But not too brain burning.

This a very well made worker placement.

The auction system for the turn order is very cool and the turn order can be very important in this game because all the game´s strategy lies on how well you program your actions so that you can launch fully equipped ships to the sea, in order to make points. As each resource has limitations in each round, the game can get quite competitive, though still being very connected with the theme. The system how the ships "fight" to go far on the track and score more points is also very original.
A solid eurogame with a medium weight.

Almost feels like it needs more options in which to place your workers. Maybe just a tad too simplified in that regard. I never really felt any tension as to whether or not I would be able to do what I wanted in a given turn. Still a good game.

We might have played by some wrong rule, but it seemed almost better to just field a ship but not sail it on the last turn. Also, the 2+2 VPs for taking the particular role seems a no-brainer.

Entertaining though it was, I completely disagree with Tom Vasel's uncharacteristically negative review of this one. 

This is a great game... a lot of tension in determining how the orders of actions take place. You can take a risk to jump ahead of another player, giving you first choice of an action (but it might cost you). Finding ways to guard against this when you desperately need an action--or several actions in a certain order--makes the game really interesting.

The way expeditions progress and fill up also has some very challenging aspects to it (and opportunities for clever play!).

Vasco Da Gama is a very good heavy Euro.  The game play can sometimes get bogged down if there are players prone to AP.  It's a game that if you play once, you might as well play several times, because it takes a game to learn some interesting things about how the last round plays out. 

There is nothing that is completely new about the game, but everything works together in a unique and balanced way.  The theme is also pretty good for this type of Euro. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Attractive, well produced game with some very clever mechanisms. but very much a gamers game.

It would be unfair to say the theme was 'pasted on' as I suspect it was the starting point for the design - however there is a disconnect between the mechanics and theme so it doesn't feel like you are launching expeditions round the cape. This results in you (well me at least) being all too aware that all you are doing is  placing cubes (meeples) into different boxes, albeit in very clever and cunning ways. Not a problem for most 'gamers' and for those in that group (myself included) it still results in an enjoyable experience, but probably not one that will bridge the gap for a family or casual crowd.

The turn order/action mechanism with it's variable costs is really very good though.

I probably shouldn't have bought this - worker placement is not really my thing when it runs to over an hour and a half. This came out when i was more tolerant of it as a mechanism.

Nice twist on the worker placement mechanic.  When you place the worker, you also place a number which determines when the worker's spot will be evaluated.  There is a good amount of luck because you don't know how much the worker will cost you until you've placed all of them.  A tile is then revealed which shows the cost which could be + or - 6 coins....depending on which number you've selected...and what tiles have already come up.  Looking forward to another play.

Players are attempting to fit out ships, and send them out to the Portuguese colonies to try and turn a profit of cash and victory points.  Standard worker placement game, with a few extra layers added in.  First, and the clever bit, is you place a worker AND a timing chip which records the order the workers will be resolved.  Second, and another clever bit, is you are never quite sure what workers will be free and what workers you will have to pay for to activate (thanks to a Caylus-like pawn that wanders up and down a track influencing the worker price).  Workers do solid shippy stuff like recruiting crew and captains, which go on ships; gaining the favour of a person to earn some special power; pick up a bit of cash; claim "projects" (an awkward term representing a shipping expedition) to be fitted out; or to launch your projects out to see - this is where the big VP's come from.  Nice game, very well designed, and plays quite well.  Certainly at the heavy end - lots of stuff spinning around in this one, but very welcome if you're in the mood from something more than the blander games like Stone Age.

The rules for moving ships ahead seem a little weird; if a row has one blank spot, nothing moves, and everything below it moving up is instead removed, which can be quite harsh and unpredictable.  Otherwise, a pretty good worker placement game about assembling multiple types of goods (workers, ships, and maps) into a finished product (an expedition).  Reminds me most of Leonardo da Vinci.

Idea:
Resourcemanagement. Gather men/ship plans/captains and send ships to score points.

Mechanism:
Special in this game is very creative system for turn orders. Each player has set number of actions, you buy them one at a time and their timing on 20 numbered tokens. Before buying 0-cost line is set somewhere and it can move up to +-3 cost. This is the key idea, you must organize actions one at a time and also try to anticipate how much you can pay if cost moves good/badly. And you must get to right actions before others go there too.

to who:
All who like resource management games should try this out.

I'm not sure what it was about this game but it really, really didn't engage me when I played it.  Maybe some more plays would change my opinion but there's so many other games that I'd rather be playing that I can't think why I'd ever play this again.

RATING: 6
A clever variation on the worker-placement genre where sequence numbers are assigned to your workers.   There is some risk in going with early sequence numbers in that they could cost more than you can afford, and money is tight in the early going of Vasco.  There are some fiddly elements to the game (like the way ships are promoted, or how captains are obtained) and so the game can seem a bit too mechanically clever for its own good.   In other words, it revels in its own gamey-ness.   And, while it wasn't too bad in our session, I can see where AP-prone groups would totally put Vasco into a lockdown.   It's not a brain-burner, but it is thinky.   I'll give it kudos for the sequencing of the workers, which I won't be surprised to see used in other games in the near future.  (p.s. why are the captains so incredibly small??)

Very clever game, full of tight decisions with risk-management thrown Into good effect.  At heart a worker-placement mechanism but because the cost of placing the early key workers has a random element you have to way up the risks of being able to play at all against the advantages gathered from playing earlier. 
Add to that a clever system of scoring points as the ships move into ever-decreasing sized ports wih reduced capacities, and you have a very exceptional game.

Again in a way, everything that is old is new again. The presentation of mechanics in VdG is fresh. If I had to define what I think a 'first tier' versus 'second tier' eurogame is, I think I would say that a first tier game is a new game that either introduces totally new mechanics or a game that blends existing mechanics into a new seamless melange. 

Ok, enough thoughts, to the game. VgD is a game all about worker placement, resources, and order resolution. What is particularly fresh in VdG is the integration of turn resolution and willingness to expend resources to go first. The scoring bump of ships is also new, but it's not as interesting as the resolution issues IMO. I'd like to play this game again, but something was missing the zing I look for in games I really enjoy. Hopefully, it'll be found in a few more plays.

This feels like a game where they had an innovative idea for placing workers but then nothing after that. The conceit here is the “ticket number” system for actions whereby you take a ticket number for an action that is resolved in a particular order. The actions have to be paid for and you don’t know exactly how much it will cost so you’re pushing your luck that you’ll be able to pay for all the actions you selected this turn. OK, it’s a euro throwing us some new curve ball here which is fine.

But the rest of the game is linear and uninspiring. You need to get crew and a boat and then sail. Each turn started off with people going for action area in the bottom right (that gives the money and/or special powers) and then things cascaded from there.  As there are four action areas and you only have four actions discs, you do things in the same logical order each turn which rendered it a procedural experience. Once you’ve seen the action selection mechanism, you’ve seen all there is to see.

Very interesting turn order mechanism. The fact that you don't know exactly the "price" of the turn order token you take (if you want to go early), has the consequence that you don't really know who's gonna be the "real starting player" when the actions are carried out. I also like the ship/harbor system, where most of the VPs are collected. How early on the track should you place your ships in order to score most victory points. The theme is quite pasted on, but the game works very well. The playing time is usually a lot longer than what is written on the box.

RATING: 8
First play, took a long while reading the rules and understanding the game, but when we started as a 2P game, it went very well and remarkably smoothly. So many Italian games have badly written or under-written rules. This errs on too many pages but finally, an Italian game that covers all the questions and is easy to refer to.

Game play turns out to be very simple, only really 4 actions to consider, and timing and order make a huge difference. Which means that the game really turns on the timing mechanism which turned on a random pricing mechanism, which I really liked and my friend not so much.

On balance, it all worked, you always had valid choices, there's more than one way to win and we thoroughly enjoyed the game. You do need to stick all the stickers on before playing, and I suggest having a practise round before coaching other players. But otherwise, go for it.

I had this eye-appealing, complex strategy game on the table for 2 1/2 weeks, trying to get around to reading the rules, which are easy to follow  

The components are quality even though the wooden captains are incredibly small--difficult to pick up, constantly dropping, and easy to lose.

I like the mechanics of how the ships travel from port to port.  Money is tight and a lot of tension in the game results from the uncertainty of what actions will cost.

The game is 5 rounds long, and if you do not carefully plan for the last round, you could find yourself with nothing at all to do.

RATING: 5
It's a tactical Euro with screwage; it's possible to sabotage the result of your many actions by sinking ships, which I feel is out of place. There's not really an engine you can build, thus the game is mostly tactical.

Its length is decent but the game didn't grab me.

I feel that there's too much going on; the major action sequencing mechanic is interesting, as are purchasing sailors, pricing of the captains and sailing, but there's no need for roles or the ship buying options.

A surprisingly great game with some very nice interlocking mechanisms. The turn order mechanism is very innovative and fun, but the greatest part of the game is the puzzle of where to place your ships.

RATING: 7.5
At first, I was slightly disappointed with this game after hearing so many good things about it. The timing order with each action selection is a neat mechanic, the artwork is beautiful, and it comes with lots of great, wooden components. The disappoint for me was that there isn't as much going on as I was expecting. There are basically four types of things you can do, and three of the four follow a logical sequence (do project acquisition first, then hire a crew, then complete an expedition). After games like Caylus, Stone Age, or Pillars, the limited options on what to do with my "workers" felt somewhat confining - until I changed my mindset and expectations, and learned to appreciate the finer points about each of the options that are there. Each of the four types of actions you can take has further decisions to make inside of it (which project(s) to pick, which crew to hire, and what expedition to go on). Combined with decisions about timing, watching what others are doing and keeping oponents from using the special powers cards for too long, and trying to make enough money to keep the more expesive options open, there's actually a lot to think about here.

A worker placement game. Fairly standard, too, if it weren't for the timing aspect.

Instead of simply placing your action pawns and then executing the action you place them together with a time marker. This marker determines when in the turn resolution step this pawn will be activated. In order to prevent players from simply always taking the earliest available slot you will have to pay money to execute early actions. However, at the beginning of the turn it is only roughly known where that cut-off point will be so you can grab an early spot and hope it won't cost you too much or play it safe and take a spot that will execute later, but at no cost.

The rest of the game is not too different from every other resource optimization and conversion game. In fact, there are others which implement that part in more interesting ways. The timing aspect by itself, however, absolutely makes VdG worth your while.

VASCO DA GAMA enthält bereits alles, was Spiele von WYG später ausmachen werden. Üppiges Spielbrett, gutes Material aus Holz und Dickpappe, eine mechanistische wie themenbefreite Eurogamigkeit mit kniffligen Verzahnungen. Mit neuem Niveau stürmte VASCO DA GAMA 2009 die Charts der Fairplay. Obwohl das Anspruchsplateau heute zum Standard modernen Vielspieldesigns zählt, fügt sich der alte VASCO auch heute noch nahtlos in die Zeit. Das Seefahrer Placement ist kreativ: Timing und Reihenfolge der Worker lassen sich gegenseitig abgrätschen. Nicht alles in VASCO ist sicher. Die Selbstorganisation vom Schiffsprojekt über das Anheuern der Mannschaft inklusive Kapitän und der Stich in die See sind beweglichen Prozessen der Gegenseitigkeit unterworfen. VASCO DA GAMA hat seine kleinen Fallen, seine sich offenbarende eigendynamische Welt. VASCO DA GAMA ist und bleibt eine Reise in die Welterseglung wert. Auf zu alten Ufern!

Initial rating. Very solid system of turn order drafting for worker placement actions. Money is tight. I sense potential here for some real shut-someone-out nastiness.

Updated and uprated: One more game, a 2p, and it blew our roof off. This is [b]not[/b] your standard no-interaction, solo-optimization Euro. Jockeying for turn order is exhilarating, and as in Poker, money can be everything when someone decides to go all-in. Multiple avenues for locking someone out of an essential action, leaving them high and dry and royally screwed. Splendid. Potential for this to become a new classic in the class of PR/Caylus/T&E. 

Update: A few more games in, and the level nausea-inducing tension this game generates still persists. Bumped rating up a notch.

Where the mechanics are pretty easy to grasp, the game play can be very analytical. In the game there are chains of actions that are going to be executed. You have to acquire workers, captains and ships and you need some way to get money for it too. The goal is the shipping as it is the main way to score victory points, and it can be some real screwage when placing them. The innovation in the game is how things are executed. In other worker placement games it is usually first come, first serve, but here you take any number available which are then executed in order. The downside with taking a low number is that it might cost you some money to execute it.

I played a four player game and thought it worked well, but I would also like to play it with three players. Opposed to the majority here on the geek, I think I would enjoy that even more. Even with four players you can’t really the shut out from an area, in the way you can with e.g. Age of Empires III

One play with three, one play with four. Abstract and complicated, and there's nothing about it that's really all that satisfying or enjoyable. You have to do a lot of planning and look-ahead to get yourself points, but a lot can go wrong. For a game that takes this much effort, there are a surprisingly large number of on-the-fly decisions. On top of that it's a chore to learn and even a little bit of a chore to play; players spend as much time fiddling with stuff and moving stuff around as they do actually making choices. Meh. I'd maybe play it again while the rules are still fresh in my head (and if everyone else knew the rules so we didn't have to teach), but once it all drops out of my head I'm never going to want to see it again.

A very complete game and well tested. Nice graphics. The only thing I worry about is replayability. Are there different paths to victory or is it just to get as many ships out there as possible? Until now (3 plays) I rate it an 7.8. It's a solid worker placement game with a pay for priority twist which makes the game a bit more of a thinker. But still one you can handle easily if you're an experienced gamer. At the first round you wonder how it should be possible to get over 100 victory points but then at the end of round 5 (if you did well) it is possible :-)

It's a well designed system, where the mechanics work without problems. But in the end it feels like many other games, sending ships for victory points and getting favors of random influential people. Thin theme applied to a spreadsheet.

There's nothing glaringly wrong with VdG, there's just nothing particularly great about it either. Looks nice, cute turn order selection - but otherwise it seems tired and formulaic, and, given the theme, it's really a wasted opportunity.

RATING: 6
Good but not great. The turn-order conceit is sort of better and sort of worse that the provost--better because it allows for greater variance in order (rather than having a set path) and is slightly more forgiving, worse because it is entirely out of players' hands and further rewards the start player.
Other than that, there's not much here--money to dudes to ships to points. Given the very crowded field of worker-placement games, not quite good enough.

Another WP game, but it can hold it's ground, as it's different enough.

Good thing is, it can get nasty and the game itself can shake you up a bit, too. You can and should plan ahead. If you don't you won't end up high in scores.

Not so good thing is, the strategy seems to be set. You have to launch ships and that's the main part of the game. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I guess it may lower the replayability.

All in all a good WP game that works really well and plays kinda fast. For me, it doesn't reach Caylus or Maestro Leonardo, but it has it's own charm.

Another dry worker placement game where you turn the crank of money to people to ship to points and money, rinse, wash repeat.  I think it is a good example of the genre and plays pretty fast.  You either like this type of game or you don't like this type of game.  I would play it in the game if I was in a very "euro" type of mood.  I think if you had some more experience with the game, you might be better able to figure out how to screw the other players over better, and it could improve.  There are better pure euros out there, and this one offers nothing new.  Another derivative and themeless worker placement game.    It does have a neat mechanic where you push your luck a little bit on turn order using numbered pieces that go on the workers you place. Overall it is not that innovative.

That action sequence mechanism is surely nice, but not nice enough to supercede Caylus or Pillars.  I find it's mostly an abstract tactical game, and I do not think there is enough variability.
I regret the theme is not a little more present. Vasco is a solid game I am happy to play but unlikely to suggest myself.

I would have liked something more thematic, but its mechanics alone are sufficient to make of VdG stand on its own feet.

For reasons I can't properly explain this struck me as the pinnacle of Just Another Euro when I played it. The variable cost of things grated me -- and I'm not generally anti-luck in games.

In my one play it felt like you *really* needed someone to be calling out numbers to keep things moving along. Otherwise, you have a tendency to lose quite a bit of time turning what should be a short game into a long one.

Yes, it is another 'ships in the sea' euro game but it is certainly not just another trading game. It has a great turn taking mechanic and it isn't about shipping or trading goods.

If you haven't played it and you end up with a chance to do so, give it a try. It's definitely unique enough to stay in my collection.

This is a game about turn order.  Yep. Only, turn order is much more granular than it is in some other games, a bit like the resolution phase in Caylus, where things happen in a particular order no matter who is doing them.  So that's interesting.  And of course, money is tight and it's always fun to try to manipulate it to try to get it to go a little further.

I did find that I wasn't thinking very hard about what things to do in my turn; I always wanted to do about the same things in the same order.  But, I think that was just me, since other players did more varied things on their turns. (2 plays)

Bel gioco di posizionamento di piruli "scelta azione" - alla Caylus, per intenderci - in cui è stata introdotta una variante semplice ma efficace: ad ogni pirulo posizionato, bisogna associare un numero, che determinerà l'ordine di esecuzione delle azioni. Più tattico che strategico, si gioca su soli 5 turni, cosa che non permette distrazioni. La fortuna è limitata, ma può fare la differenza, con la precisazione - importante - che ad ognuno è lasciata facoltà di scegliere quanti rischi prendersi.

Only one play.  With 2 players.  It was good.  Better than average.  But not really great IMHO.

There were interesting decisions abounding.  Sequencing your actions was engaging.  As was one-upping your opponent.

I must agree that the only one source of points was a little disheartening.

Still, it's worth playing more times to cement my feelings.  It was easy to explain and understand to me.

OK game.  Solid mechanics and everything works smoothly.

BUT:
- the game is very very mechanical.  You can feel the artificial mechanics during your every move.  There's completely no connection to the theme.

- I felt no excitement/emotions during the game

There is so much to keep track of in this very tough game.  It can't easily be compared to any other games, but the main mechanism is worker placement.  Turn order is constantly changing, and it is what creates the tension in the game and keeps it interesting.

My only complaint about the game is the difficulty in learning all the rules.  I played this wrong about 5 times before getting the rules down pat.

RATING: 7.4
Bokkensprong 28/02/14. Met Pascal, Els en ik. Worker placement waarbij je bij je mannetje telkens ook een nummerschijf moet leggen, die de volgorde bepaalt waarin de acties zullen worden gespeeld. Die volgorde is heel belangrijk. Mogelijke acties: bemanning en/of een kapitein ronselen, een route kopen, een schip doen varen (levert punten op), of geld nemen/een van de vier invloedrijke personen consulteren (witte pater levert telkens een extra bemanningslid, koning levert een extra speelbeurt, zeeman levert een spookschip om een route vol te krijgen, en ridder levert startspeler + twee punten per beurt). Varende schepen brengen per beurt geld en/of punten op; eens een vloot voltallig is, gaat ze naar een "hogere" bestemming, indien het schip dat toelaat en indien er plaats genoeg is. Schepen die afvallen zijn verloren, maar de kapitein wordt opnieuw inzetbaar. Niet waw, maar wel een vrij goed spel (de regels zijn wel een redelijke boterham).

fun game, and even though I don't like gambling, the choice in action order markers, weather to gamble or not on what the cost of even being able to take the action is interesting... the +3 on our last round messed everyone up.  I agree with others that the way the ships moved up and if they can't get bumped off (and hence stop producing, even though you get the captain back) to be a bit out of control even in a 3 player game, seems it would be really random with more players.

Solid worker placement eurogame, slightly reminiscent of Caylus. Quite fiddly in places, and with little "escalation" (i.e. your last turn quite resembles your first), the game probably isn't my cup of tea. Time will tell, though: I look forward to playing again.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2017)

What´s your Game? is perhaps my favorite game publisher. I have really liked every one of their games (except the awful Big Manitou) and they have the best track record for me. I also have a lot of respect for Mr. Paolo Mori (the designer) so I was expecting a good game, and fortunately, I found a good game. I really like Vasco da Gama.

The rules are easy to learn and teach, you can do it under 15 minutes. Playtime exceed 2 hours.

The game´s components and the art are ok. Vasco da Gama comes with many stickers (I heavily dislike this) but my SO always helps to sticker them. I won´t ever do this activity, I’m bad at it and I hate to do it. 

The theme is ok, but, as usual with this kind of game, you don’t feel it through the game.

The game´s decisions are very interesting. In one phase you have to plan your moves, you do this by choosing numbered discs (from 1-20), the earlier you want to act the more money you will probably have to pay (there isn’t a certainty on how much you will have to pay). Also, you can plan with disc 16 first and then with disc 6 next, the order of the actions are from low to high so the action 6 will happen first than the action 16, even if you planned them in disorder. This mental hoop caused problems to some players who felt that the orders should be executed in the order they planned them, I love this mechanism.  In the next phase the actions will be executed in numerical order. You only have 4 possible actions to choose from (purchase projects, recruit sailors, expedition, characters) but the decision is not obvious. What I really like about the game is that you really need to analyze your game situation and your opponent´s so you can maximize your plans. It isn’t easy, but it is very fun and rewarding. Timing is very important. 

The luck factor is low, but it is present in the Vasco da Gama tiles and in the project tiles. Sometimes you bet that you will be able to execute an action and you won’t be able to, still, in this case you get money instead (in most cases) but it can really hurt you.

Bottom line, Vasco da Gama is a good Euro game and one I want to play again soon. It is easy to teach, but hard to play well. It is novel, I haven’t played a game like it. It has very interesting decisions, low luck factor, and lots of fun. It has a permanent place in my game collection.

One of 2009´s favorites.

The turn order mechanic is innovative - just when it seems that there is nothing fresh in the Eurogame design space out comes a new twist.

Unfortunately the theme is a bit mushy.  I need different colors of shipmen why exactly?  And what explains the bump-up mechanic?

The interlocking mechanisms are interesting; the theme binding just doesn't work for me though.

Worker placement...I'm a fan of worker placement and after the first game this one did not let me down.  First game was only a two player game...I would really like to see this game with another player or too.  I would say though that after one play this is a game that will go to the buy list.

Thinky euro WP with relative short playing time, nice art, a pasted on theme and perhaps a bit dry game play. This game emphasizes timing the sequence of your actions. It's an unique feature and at the same time the charm of the game. The game offers one path to victory and the player with the best timing and efficiency is likely to win. Low replay value given the unidirectional nature of the game.

"Ship," "Crew," "Ocean," Victory Points: You do the math. 

It's possible there's a good idea at the core of Vasco de Gama, but it's so poorly realized that it's hard to tell. Essentially, this takes Caylus-style worker placement and allows the players to create the order of resolution while they draft actions. And maybe that would be interesting in a better game, but VdG fails to deliver that game in just about every way. For one thing, the game is inexplicably constructed around a spike of randomness that is blunt, uninteresting, doesn't provide for good decision making, and can reward or screw players with high variance. As one of my geekbuddies has pointed out, it's probably more over-the-top than the master-builder draw in Pillars of the Earth. And it doesn't even look intriguing on the surface. It looks crude and it is crude. Aside from that, what you actually do in this game is about as lifeless and procedural as it gets. You need money to hire crew to man ships to send on voyages for victory points. There are five different crew-member types but they are, surprise surprise, interchangeable. If I'm going to collect sets of different colored crew-members, they had better provide different roles on the ships and impact the potential of a voyage. Once you purchase a ship and hire a crew, the ship itself doesn't do anything concrete. You don't discover anything or engage in any commerce. It's not clear what your objectives are, who is underwriting the whole thing, etc. 

In sum: players purchase ship tiles with slightly variable investment returns (based on what, who knows, and don't even get me started on how the player can be rewarded mid-voyage), buy a set of colored meeples to go with the tile, and move them to the "voyage" part of the board in exchange for victory points. Good Lord. It's worth noting that this stripped down, barely functioning framework makes the dynamic order-of-resolution completely uninteresting, so much so that it's hard to know if it is even inherently interesting. 

Games this "streamlined" depress me.

Buzz game and winner of the Fairplay trophy from Essen 2009. One of the better worker placement games. The innovative numbered disc mechanism to determine the order of actions and the varied interrelations between the four placement areas are on the plus side. But I'm afraid that it can get repetitive as quick as most other worker placement games. It probably depends on whether there's an alternative to putting most ships on the board through most efficient use of resources or not. Somehow all five rounds feel similar and there's not much in terms of developing your position.
My personal worker placement ranking (no claim for completeness):
Agricola -> Pillars of the Earth -> Caylus -> Vasco da Gama -> Maestro Leonardo -> Stone Age -> Age of Empires III -> Carson City

Favorable initial impression.  It must be a pretty strong game, because the theme is as boring as they come and the worker placement mechanic is a little overused too.

The turn order mechanism is interesting, allowing you to budget for prime placement or to plan your turn out.  I like the risk involved.  

It seems like this game rewards extreme planners, which I am not, but the play time is manageable and packed full of interesting decisions.

RATING: 7
A brain damage game. Worker placement game which has clearly been created with the mentality "theme first, mechanisms second". I've understood that instead of Vasco da Gama there was originally Henry the Navigator, but Vasco da Gama was chosen in the end because he's more well-known. With Henry it would have been even cooller and he would also have fit better with the rest of the personalities of the game. But enough of that. If you like Caylus and worker placement in general this is a game for you. Five turns and the tension grows all the time as there aren't enough actions and everybody else is grabbing those crucial actions and possibly attempting to do their evil doings before you. The game is impossible to count properly and AP can appear, but mathematical brain isn't enough here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I like the push-your-luck pick-a-number initiative: it's new, simple, intriguing, makes for interesting decisions. I like the market system, where you pay per colors of meeples you take, even if you take 5 of a kind (which makes the turn order very important, and makes you undercut opponents). I like the character system (although the character themselves aren't as interesting as I think they could be). But the one thing I really appreciate about this game is the boats: timing the completion of rows to screw out your opponents' boats, and maximizing the lifetime of yours, is quite neat. I'm a bit annoyed that sinking them on the very last turn can be so beneficial (as your captains come back to you, so you can put them on boats for 3 VPs a shot), but it's a cool, simple system, with deep choices and lots of interaction to be had.

RATING: 6
At a glance this might seem like a heavier and less transparent version of Francis Drake: you gather ships and crew and then send them out on abstract voyages. Here I think it'll take a game or two before you get a handle on where and how to get the points rolling in at an acceptable rate. There are three resource draft areas where you collect funds, ships, crew and assorted bonuses, and one ship launching area where your assets must converge optimally into victory points; you access all this using a turn order draft superimposed on the action draft. Unlike Francis Drake the expedition draft space does evolve between rounds and reading this correctly is an important part of the game. Probably respectable but did not instill much enthusiasm.

Feels like half a game. Like you do all this weird setup stuff and it feels like it should all lead to some kind of big payoff, but instead you just get points and do more of the weird setup stuff. It wasn't awful and it didn't make me want to throw it off a rooftop, but it did make me want to trade it for a better game.

Yet another worker placement, but I like the twist.  In particular, I appreciate how you need a strategy for your entire turn, but you need to react to tactical opportunities that arise.  I am not sure what I think of the luck factor yet, it annoys me when somebody plans their entire turn based on the "-3" coming up... and it does.  Bah, humbug!

Very good logistics/worker placement game with some unique game mechanics. The sequence in which actions are executed depend on the number token selected rather than a set order. While very cleaver, this can have devastating effect on execution of a players plans due to mis-timing or out of sequence selections. Although the launching of early game ships can produce some much needed revenue (which is typically tight the whole game), saving the valuable crew and captains for more valuable ships in latter rounds can certainly have merit. The addition of a push-your-luck mechanic in determining which action number to select is also a nice twist. Playing too aggressively can result in peril, but a good balance of aggressive but smart play is often what it takes to win.  I think the game is by far best with 4-players and still good at 3-players. I have not played it with only 2.

PLUS
Wiele ciekawych i fajnych mechanizmów, wszystkie bardzo dobrze ze sobą współgrają i są połączone po czym schodzą się aksamitnie w całość (czyli gre); różne przywileje do dyspozycji; wymaga planowania czasowego (kolejność wykonywanych czynności ważna!).
MINUS
Mechanizm wybierania i płacenia za czynności może być za losowy, rozrzut cen za szeroki, przez co może mieć za duży wpływ na sukces w rozgrywce albo jego brak.
SUMA
Naprawdę dobrze zaprojektowana włoska gra planszowa.

PLUS
Many interesting and neat mechanisms, all very well interconnected and colluding before smoothly converging into the big picture (i.e. the game); several special abilities to choose from; temporal planning required (action sequence important!).
MINUS
Mechanism of choosing and paying for actions may be too random, the amplitude of action prices too wide, thus having a too strong effect on success or its lack of.
SUM
A fine, really well designed Italian board game.

Nicely done worker placement -game, which has some new idea included. After the first game I rated it 7.25, but I also said, that my rate might come down. After three games, I think 6 is enough for this, why? Because game isn't unique enough and don't offer surprise elements... or at least very little. There should be a way to shorten the game a bit too.

A gamers worker placement game. 

Send your ship(s) out to water and score points. To do that you first have to build a ship and remember to hire a captain and crew.

I like the mecanism to choose game order (haven't see it anywhere else).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
LIKE:

* Four player game is a tightly contested knife fight in a back alley.  
* Ship placement is a neat little mechanism where you can really mess up the best laid plans of your opponents.  The way ships move up can make ships score several times.
* Money is often tight and trying to do everything you want to do can be difficult.
* Tension between when you take an action versus when others take the same action can be interesting.  Don't make a mistake and choose to take an action too soon before one of your actions you need to take before another.
* Special abilities are interesting and add flavor to the game.

DISLIKE:

* Three player game is too loose in my limited experience.  I only want to play this game if there are four players.
* Not sure I care much for the beginning uncertainty of what the starting level will be for when people will potentially need to pay for actions.  
* Captains are really tiny and hard to pick up.

It's a worker placement game, know that up front.

The real twist is managing the timing of your actions combined with smart use of the character powers and perhaps a little luck.

Really a solid mix of gather, manage, and place. The real key is the timing of the actions as well as clever placement of your ships in the exploration section.

Solid game.

I really liked this game. Nice bits and art. It didn't "wow' me after 1 play, but I find it intriguing. Vasco de Gama is really quite simple, with only 4 possible actions on your turn (I'm not differentiating between characters and income in the bottom right action space). It's definitely tight, both in terms of money and available actions. I like the turn order mechanic. I guess it's just, like many shipping games, really dry. While that doesn't bother me, it also doesn't leave me dying to play it again right away. All and all, a solid game. Hopefully I'll be able to hold onto it.

02/20/10 Played a three-player game. Nice components except for the tiny, tiny captains. Theme-wise its good except once you get to your destination there's no trading. Why would anyone acquire a ship, a crew, a trade route map, sail to Africa in an empty ship and...  just stop. A one way trip in a cargo ship with an empty hold doesn't sound like commerce. I was slightly less bothered by the colors of crewmen meaning nothing. They could have easily added just one sentence in the rules saying something like: gray = helmsmen, gold = sail handlers, aqua = cargo handlers, purple = officers, white = missionaries. I love German/Euro type games, but often they neglect even the most rudimentary accoutrements of theme. Even so, its a nice game that I look forward to playing again.  
04/20/10 Another three-player game. 08/24/10 Ditto. 03/19/11 Another three-player game. I've grown despondent over how poorly I do each outing. I never come anywhere close to winning. In fact, I'm getting worse! In brief, I don't grok this game as far as knowing what I should be doing to win. Pity, for I kinda like it. Yet I now feel I don't want to go thru this the disheartening experience more than once every 9 months or so.

Being oblivious to this game before even playing it, I didn't know what to expect from this one.  I didn't catch it at first either...  But I was honestly pleasantly surprised after my first play.  I will play this one again for sure because it was a blast.  Your turn come back again quite often, so down time is pretty low and the decision tree is NOT meaningless.  

Overall great game which  would recommend to play.  Just don't expect to grasp all the subtlety on your first game and don't expect this to it the table with casual players, there are much better "casual friendly" worker placement games out there.

Game in a Nutshell: Place your workers to build ships, hire sailors and jockey for position at the docks to gain you points as they set sails.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: The thing I like and main difference in this game versus other worker placements I've tried is how you can actually jump ahead of other people in line if you don't mind paying a fee or maybe even pushing your luck a little. Simpler then it first looks, the rules keep it in a good range of having enough things to consider but streamlined as too not cause extreme AP or brainburn. Like most worker placement games, I'm sure it scales well for different player numbers.

Cons: There's a fair number of finicky little details and rules you must remember as the game moves along. Visual reminders or even a flow chart were sorely underdeveloped. I prefer games with a sense of ownership and visual proof that you're doing something; unfortunately, there's not a lot to show any of that and it ends up feeling more confusing then it really is. 

Other: I think there's some nice mechanics developed here that will set it apart from other worker placement games on the market today. It's probably not the first I would recommend in the genre (Agricola is one of those due to added variety and higher visual punch), but if someone were a fan of this type of game, then I think there's enough here to warrant at least looking at.

Best Use: Another good twist on a Worker-placement game for those who are looking to expand their collection in that area.

Worker placement game with a good twist in how much actions cost.

UPDATE: Second game was much better. I really like how the ships go from port to port gaining rewards. Of course not every ship can fit into the next port so there's some interesting tactics in screwing your opponents over. Moving rating up a point. 2013-02-23

an easy 8.5 to start out with.  i love the twist on the now ubiquitous 'worker placement' game.  money extremely tight and very few ways to get more.  great decision making with whether to take actions you will likely pay for, but will have a better choice of what's available vs taking an action likely for free but with fewer optimal choices.

*****

I think 4 player is still the best way to play, but 3 player was suprisingly interesting.  Probably bumps to a 9 with 4 player, but a 7.5 or 8 with 3 player.  2 player would drop a lot more.

Interesting game, but doesn't do enough with the theme to really capture my interest - as in, that I'd want it.

Also, with even experienced players having trouble at times getting the order of actions right, I've got to assume that game-play is just not logical, or perhaps is made more complex than necessary.

Age of Empires has a similar system in that you can need to do one action before another, but at least it isn't as confusing as this...

Worker placement with an interesting timing element. Couple of approaches, seems fairly balanced and works well. A solid game, good and almost very good. However, I haven't played this in many years, and don't really have any desire to do so.

I really don't get why Tom Vasel did what he did to this game... I get it that if you don't like Euros you probably won't like this game but going to that extreme is a whole different ball park...

The game is very well designed, Paolo Mori, did it again with this one... I really like his designs.

The resolution of the selected actions mechanic in this game is just fantastic... Sometimes you have to push your luck because you really need to get a boat or a captain before you can launch ships, but you have to launch them before the other player does it and he picked a lower number to do that and so you are forced to go low and risk having to pay a lot of money to be able to perform the actions...

Great game!!

Game is devoid of life and fun. A few times as I read the directions, I had to read the box blurb again to try and remember exactly what the game theme was about. Then I wondered to myself, what exactly urged me to buy this? The mechanics were cold and without a soul, I didn't find myself panicking, worrying, or any other emotion that make other games memorable and get me to play again. I can go on about how bad this game was, but just check out Tom Vasel's video review, he took the words right out of my mouth. One of my worst purchases.

Very good looking game that I'd like to look at. Similar to other worker based games in that you place down action markers, then take those actions to collect resources.  You then send ships that sail.  At the end of each round if the harbors are full, they advance to the next one, provided there is room and they have an adequate 'range'.

Looks fairly interesting.

I can see why Tom Vasel would complain about the theme.  But there are many other boring themed games as well (i.e. Puerto Rico).  All I know is that the game play is SOLID!  And there is enough theme to tie all the abstract elements together.

I can think of many games with great themes and the gameplay sucks (i.e. Risk).  I'll stick with Vasco da Gamas.

This is a worker placement game,  with a twist. There are sequence numbers form 1-20, and each round, a white action marker denotes which sequence number is zero cost. Players then take a sequence number and place their worker, and the sequence numbers are resolved in order. So you can pay more money to go first in an area. You also can't predict precisely how much you have to pay as the actual cost is a number from 1-3 from the white action marker. 

You are trying to launch ships, which require crew and a captain. But your ships could get destroyed by higher value ships so you have to be careful about where you place your ships. There is a lot going on here, and if you want to play a worker placement game with a unique mechanism to resolve them, this game is for you. I enjoy the game, and it is hard to analyze with how the ships move and potentially destroy other ships.

One of the better worker placement games. As a worker placement hater, a rating of 5 is quite high.

Action-order is determined by the number you take. So it is like two-step worker placement. You must pay to go earlier. Also it is a nice touch that you can forfeit your actions for money. Problem of this game with me is unintuitive ship movement and king-making caused by it. Also it is a bit too long. I wish the game is with in 60-90 minutes range.

I played it twice in a row and that helped me to understand. Each took us 120-135 minutes.

Now I played for the 3rd time and I feel I am done with the game.

Lots of clever systems that seam to flow together well.  I can see why many people really like this game; however, it felt very mechanical to me, and I never quite meshed what I was doing with what it was suppose to represent in the world of the game.  I never once felt like I was organizing and launching sea-bound escapades.

Keep in mind that I only have one play under my belt, so my feelings may change with subsequent plays.

RATING: 8
It's a good worker placement game with solid game mechanics. Game has a good flow and is pretty simple overall. The most unique feature/mechanic is the "sailing" of the ships which basically just means that you can score several times points with ships in right circumstances but offers some interesting decisions. What I liked about graphical design is the fact there are visual aids to just about every key rules in each action space. This adds visual clutter but really helps if you play games seldomly.

RATING: 6
It’s worker placement, but you can only place in 4 areas. And as you're placing your workers you'll mostly have no guarantee on whether you'll be picking in that area first, second, third, whatever. Which means you can't plan confidently on what you'll get. So scatter things around, hope you get what you want but don't expect it, and try and plan things so that you can take advantage of whatever you get. It works and all, being a standard turn resources into VP game. But it takes an increasingly tired genre and adds a layer of interactive chaos which reduces strategy and increases downtime. Not a great result.

Managing your money in order to be able to play your actions in the needed order and before others is tough, due to the possibility of having to pay more then expected. Well worth a try.

This game features an action drafting system where you not only get to choose what you want to do, but also when you want to do it (between the 1st action and the 25th action overall).  Generally, getting to go earlier is better, but there are some things you need to do before others, and early actions will cost a somewhat random amount of money.  The actions let you assemble what you need for a boat voyage, and there are some interesting decisions about whether you want a long voyage that will reward you gradually as the game progresses, or a short one that will give you immediate benefit.  Overall, I found the game to be enjoyable.

2/17/10: A pretty good euro game.  Nothing groundbreaking, but the unknown cost for actions is fairly intriguing.  I do worry that this game doesn't have great replay value.  I may lower the score later if I find that's the case.  As for now, it's a neat enough game to play.

5/2/10: Lowered the score from a 7 to a 5.  I was right.  This game doesn't seem to hold up after multiple plays.  It's still decent, but with a few more plays, it would become boring to me.

Quite an interesting game for an euro game. There are many ways to victory and many tough decisions to have. A good presentation of a rarely used theme here.

Neat game - the action mechanic is very interesting. It's the first that I've seen that decouples queuing for action choices and the choices themselves, and it feels a lot more interesting to me than its cousin, the turn-order auction. Each of the sub-systems (commisioning ships, hiring crew, hosting important figures, and sending out voyages) are also well-designed. I did find the game a bit dryer than I expected, though - there's nothing really thematic about the exploration or the different colors of crew member. Of course, YMMV on whether that matters!

In this game, everyone is trying to get their boats into the best scoring positions on the boat chart. Each boat has a number printed on it, which determines the maximum number value in the spot it can occupy, and sending a boat to the scoring area generates you points matching the slot you took. At the end of the round, the boats in completed rows click up into empty slots if there's room. This usually results in boats not having anywhere to go and being removed from the game. Understanding and manipulating the flow of these boats is really the most crucial element of the game, but it can feel difficult to get a sense of this process on the first play.

However, the magic of this game is definitely the highly interactive turn order mechanism. When you place a worker on an action spot you send along with it a number token from a central limited board of markers. The number indicates the order in which things will resolve. There's a white marker in the number grid that moves after everyone has selected their actions. Numbers earlier that the ultimate position of that marker get more expensive, and numbers after the marker wind up free. This makes for an excellent sense of tension and bluffing that can result in some actions being lost, to merely pass and collect a few dollars.

Vasco da Gama is a worker-placement game with great Essen write-ups, but I found it a bit underwhelming. The action selection mechanic is nice, with players picking from discs marked from 1 to 20 and placing them on the actions they wish to perform. A lower number will let you play earlier but may end up costing you a lot of money, and you need to be careful to program your four or five actions each round in a logical order. The problem is that the actions themselves are not particularly varied or interesting. There are only four action areas to place in, and you will often want to take one of each, in a fairly obvious order. On the other hand, the system for moving ships is quite interesting and seems to be where a lot of the strategy lies. The player who realised how to work it best won our game by a country mile. I'd play again, but I am in no rush.

The interesting twist in worker placement. The workers represent the order the actions are to be performed. Earlier in order the more choices available. However going early may add to the expense, but it is not certain by how much it will be. So there is risk factor to pushing the boundary. 
The actions are trying to draft boats required crew for the boat, captains. Also driven by order is the ability to place the boats on colony rows that give a short term benefit, and victory points as the promote to the next tier if able. 
Fairly light weight, but not much of interest beyond the turn action placement. 
A game I don't mind playing but have no need to own.

A tenner from the Works and I've been really pleased with it thus far. An interesting twist on worker placement and some nice opportunities to develop (and then execute) a plan. It's a game that demands a certain amount of concentration (and experience) because actions need to be sequenced in the correct order and it is easy to mismanage that when selecting them out of sequence and whilst worrying about what other players are doing. It's not as horrendous as it sounds, but it's not one to break out with inexperienced gamers.

There's nothing new or extremely innovative inside the box, but what it does, it does really well.

It presents you with some of the most complex and satisfying decisions of any worker placement I've played. The initiative track is genius. The rules are easy to digest, but strategic and tactical decisions run deep. The game does seem to suffer from a slight thematic disconnect to its mechanics, but I don't think it's any different from a typical Knizia or Schacht offering.   

The components and artwork are great. My one gripe is the layout of the game board. It gets the job done, but it's uninspired. Even so, It does little to detract from the overall experience, which is excellent.

I'll admit, this really does seem like a game that should drown in the mire of euro sameness, but in spite of itself, it breaks form the pack of like-minded games, through sheer finesse, and delivers brilliantly.

--Jan2010-- Whoa!  Now this is a worker placement game.  The selection of time impulse along with the placement really makes this a delightful brainburner.  While I'd be happy to own it, I'm not sure who I can force it on successfully:  I may be happy playing Ron & Dave's copies.

One of my favourites of this year's Essen releases - a novel take on the worker placement genre, where timing is very important.  However, after a few plays it does seem to have lost some interest.  Not sure how many replays this one will stand before it gets boring.

Great game with great components. Players prepare ships to sail to Indoa. Ships need sailors and a captain before they can be sent out. Ships earn victory points according to where they sail to and bonuses according to the ship type and the harbor they sail to. Looking forward to playing again.

Tom Vasel wasn't far off. It wasn't quite as impenetrable as something like Goa, but it had the same problem of mostly being pointless mechanics thrown together into a setting that doesn't have any relation to what you actually do in the game. It'll be mostly forgotten in a couple of years.

1 play so far, very rich game that begs for another play.
I fear the multiple turn order auctions and the complexity of preparing a good set of voyages may turn out to be to random to make this one of my all time favorites.  Funny, I am growing to realize I prefer the cold calculation of dice or a deck of card over second guessing 3 opponents all with the power to deny me.  A game needs some of both but not to much of either.  I really like the turn order track, it is the games most novel element.  The roles are also very well done in balance and execution.

Yes, it is yet another game about the Age of Discoveries, in the same light brown color tones and with the worker placement mechanic, but, sorpresively, it feels different somehow and it is very tense to play.

RATING: 8
A rather novel mechanism that determines the order of actions puts this worker placement game a notch above most others in the genre. The worker placement/actions phase is mostly about preparing and then launching trading expeditions up the east coast of Africa and towards India. The way the ships interact with the landings and one another during this phase is game design at its best. 

The theme represents a fascinating and golden period of Portuguese history (and my only minor complaint is that I would have loved to see some background information in the rule book on the historical characters that are represented in the game). The board is attractive, functional, and the game comes with good quality components.

Caveat - had the game demoed at the end of a day at a Con, we were rushed and had the WORST rules 'splanataion ever.  So I will be willing to revisit.

But from what I saw it just didn't excite me.  For me, there are tonnes of other games that offer a lot more in a similar package.

The numbered-disc-action-sequence-selection thing was interesting enough - more interesting than enjoyable though.  The rest of the mechanics were a little meh, and what was there just didn't seem to gel together at all.  Just a bunch of incongruous stuff mashed together.

I liked this more than I thought I would based on comments saying it was mediocre. It's a lot less mediocre than a lot of recent stuff!

The worker placement is simple - 4 workers, 4 places to put them. But the key is the turn order involved.

RATING: 9
This is a very good game with a most interesting type of worker placement mechanic, where you choose a number to go with your action, and that number will decide the order in which actions are resolved. The twist is that the lower numbers will have to be paid for and there's a small random element to decide how much, so taking lower numbers can be a risk, especially if money is tight. Also the navigation phase is very challenging as you try to decide which landing spot to send your ships to. 

A real brain burner with some very challenging decisions. Great game!

I liked it.  A lot, actually.

It just took a long time to find that out.  Why?  

The almost unfathomable instruction booklet seems to be written not to teach the game, but to refresh the memory of someone who already understands the game.  I acknowledge that it [i]is[/i] thorough, and it [i]does[/i] provide the information necessary to play the game.  It simply doesn't do so in a way which facilitates [i]learning[/i] how to play.  Unwieldy terminology is a problem, making some sentences difficult to parse (e.g. the "First Free of Charge Action Marker").  Unintuitive phrasing is another problem.   For example, throughout the rules, the Characters are referred to by name (e.g. Girolamo Sernigi) rather than function (the Merchant).  Perhaps the biggest blunder is the omission of an overview.  An overview provides a framework which allows a new player to see how the rules fit together, so that as he reads the instructions, the flow of play becomes apparent.  Without an overview, we had to [b]figure out[/b] how all those rules fit together.  This was inordinately difficult considering how [b]streamlined[/b] the actual play turned out to be.  Furthermore, the game does not include a player aid of any sort.  A turn summary would have helped immeasurably.

But once we had the rules figured out, play was quite good.  Elegant, even.

I had a hard time coping with how the sequence of actions didn't fit my preconceptions.  I was prepared to deal with the four action types changing order each round, so long as each type took place [i][b]together[/b][/i] (e.g. [i][b]all[/b][/i] recruiting actions take place, then [i][b]all[/b][/i] character actions, et cetera).  But of course, that's not the case.  Every action taken can be of any type, so each round required that we plan both the [i][b]order[/b][/i] and the [i][b]type[/b][/i] for every individual action.  That took a lot of prioritizing, to account for not only your own plans, but for your opponents' as well.  Yet, for all my difficulties, it was this sequence of actions which gave the game much of its character.

On that note, I particularly liked the mechanism which governed the price associated with action sequence.  For each of their actions, players claim numbered tokens (called "Sequence Numbers") to determine the order in which they will execute their actions.  (Played from lowest to highest.)  Each round, a special threshold number will be established.  If a player's Sequence Number is lower than the threshold number, they must pay the difference in coins to be able to take the associated action.  The clever bit is that the threshold number is not established until [b]after[/b] players have claimed their Sequence Number tokens.  Beforehand, players only know the [b]range[/b] (of seven numbers) in which the threshold number will occur.  Furthermore, Sequence Number tokens aren't merely claimed, they're paired with the player's Action Discs and assigned to an action zone, thereby committing the player's limited actions to a particular course.  So taking a token with a low number in order to ensure timely action [b]may[/b] incur a cost.  Money can be quite tight, but the order of actions is hugely important, so this bit of risk can be quite tempting.  

During play, I found the game engaging, thematic, and fun.  And looking back, I have to call it fascinating.  For days after our first play, I found myself thinking about the various mechanisms, both for their distinctiveness and for how well they worked.  

I really didn't want to like this so much.  We have enough worker placement games.  And enough games with an exploration theme.  We don't need another.  We don't.

Or so I thought.  We now own this.

Played once with 3P and once with 4P. Vasco da Gama takes the choose-your-turn-order mechanism found in games like [thing=66188][/thing] and [thing=90040][/thing] and ramps it up a notch by allowing players to determine the the order of their individual actions. Players have to not only pay attention to the sequence of their own actions, but also watch out for actions that their opponents might grab first. Adding a gamble to the process is the Free Action marker which moves along the action order track and may penalise players who take earlier actions. The resulting mechanism is an odd one – it challenges players to weigh out the different factors in taking actions, but induces headaches if one overthinks the process.

The other noteworthy mechanism is the method of scoring ships. Ships score VP when a row is full and then move up to the next row, with low-valued ships eventually bumped off as they ascend the ranks. While it may seem unpredictable at first, players who observe their opponents' ships can time their own launching of ships to trigger a chain reaction and rake in loads of VP. 

My verdict for Vasco da Gama is mixed; it doesn't rise much above your average run-of-the-mill Euro, but the action order mechanism is fun to tinker around with occasionally. I personally enjoy this more as a 3P game as it is more laid-back and has less room for AP to occur. The 4P game may be more tense, but it also skirts dangerously close to overwhelming you with the possible options.

Szép játék, jó játék, gémereknek kifejezetten ajánlott, de óriási AP veszélyes. A játék munkáslerakós. Egyik helyen hajókat, a másikon kapitányt és matrózokat szerzünk. A két még fennmaradó helyen pedig különböző segítőket és pénzt, illetve az utolsó helyen maga a kikötés történik. 4, illetve segítővel 5 akciót oszthatunk el ezekre a helyekre. A játék nagy újítása a akciók sorrendjének meghatározása. Az, hogy korábbi helyekért pénzt kell fizetni még nem lenne nagy dolog, mert ilyen sok más játékban is előfordul, de az, hogy 20 akciókorong közül tudunk választani sorrendet már érdekesen hangzik. Emiatt viszont egy-egy játékos, még aki nem is hajlamos a gondolkodásra az is nagyon sokat töprenghet. Ehhez jön még a hajóválasztás és kikötés végiggondolásának nehézsége is. Sok játékkal találkoztam már, de egyértelműen ez volt a leggondolkodósabb. Sajnos úgy érzem ez a dolog megöli ennek az alapjaiban nem rossz játéknak a játékélményét. Gémerek számára mindenképp ajánlott a kipróbálás.

An interesting worker-placement game. The rules are dense, and there is a lot of information squeezed onto the board and bits (which are very nice); but actually the rules are pretty straightforward. Players each have 4 "workers"; in turn, they place them, one at a time, in different areas of the board. These allow you to buy ships, hire crew/captain, get a special power, or launch an expedition (where you score VP/coin for the boat, and also for reaching the target). Placement happens from starting player and clockwise, but the tricky part is resolution: when placing token, also place one of the numbered (1-20) discs. Resolve actions in numerical order, but deal with the next tricky part: each round (of 5), most of the later actions are free but you have to pay Real (which is in short supply) to take the earlier actions (early/late determined by another interesting mechanism). Ship scoring is also cool: you get an immediate payoff, and also one each turn -- if your boat is still around; so you have some decisions to make about which boats to acquire, and where to place them.

Worth further play.

Played it once with 3 players and liked it a lot. It has some nice mechanics, very well engaged. It plays in about 90 minutes but maybe it could drop a bit to 60. I particularly like the choosing action and the contracting crew mechanics.

Now that the final version is out I can rate it properly. As a Portuguese I love the theme of course. I like all the tiny little aspects of the game. It's a pure eurogame with some tweaks on the action selection feeling that makes it new in certain aspects.

The time of play is excellent for what players can expect of it. Comparing to other new euros this one is a lot more fun and interactive.

Components are excellent and the artwork fits the theme very well. It's a very beautiful game.

Played again with 3 players. This is, for an euro game, one of the most interesting games released this year. A great add on to any collection and one of those games that will be played a lot.

There are many ways to win this game but the pick of the right characters at the right time seems to be the key to success. I guess that having a character is always better than not but the right timing to get one prevents our opponents of doing something and that's an amazing advantage and it really can trash an opponent's strategy.

Based on one two player game i'd say this is one of the best Euros to come out of Essen 2009. The action selection order mechanism is very clever, requires a lot of thought as does the ship placement. I think it will be much better with 3 or 4 players, rating may go up.

Only problem is the rules. Not written (or edited it would appear) by a native English speaker. The only blip on a lovely game production

Definately better with 4 than 2. 

Much better with 4 as there are less free actions.

Little bit puzzled by the negative reception to vasco da Gama since it seems, to me, to be much stronger than most subsequent titles from the same publisher.

The core of the game is an action-selection mechanism based on tickets numbered in the range 1-22, which are first placed and then resolved in order. Players take turns choosing any ticket and assigning it, with one of their 4 action discs, to one of the four action areas. The caveat is that there is a semi-random pivot point, e.g. 12, with a variance of up to +/- 3 revealed only after placement is complete. Resolving an action numbered below the final pivot point will cost the difference in coins. Money is extremely tight, so there is major tension in the risk management at play here: you want to go earlier, but how low can you afford to go? That 10 looks nice, but can you afford 5 coins if the variance turns out to be +3?

The second key piece of the puzzle is the navigation section of the board, which is the major source of points. Ships are worth points when placed, and again each round if the area they are in is full. Ships in a full area also sail to the next one (if there is room), where they may end up scoring again in the next round, and so on. This opens the door both for very cheap points and for some very nasty indirect interaction.

My biggest qualm is the thought that there's just a little too much randomness. Sequencing is critical, so a variance of +3 vs -3 in action cost makes a particularly huge difference; missing your first action might make your fourth redundant. That's really the only major problem, though; the nature of the action selection is that most other random elements just add variance, so it won't happen often that the player first in turn order lucks into some spectacular opportunity.

Solid, cutthroat worker placement.

Theme somewhat incorporated.  Game fairly easy to learn and play.  Game play offers tough choices.  Blends many different mechanics together well.  The components are excellent - colorful mounted mapboard, thick chits & wood playing pieces.  Rule book is very good - in color with examples but unclear on a few points.  Playing time is about 2 hours which feels right.

This was a strange one. The action selection mechanism was very interesting but also incredibly strange. The first part of a round involves each player selecting an action spot and choosing a 1-18 priority token. Actions are taken in order of priority tokens. The cost for each action depends on the relative value of the market that is determined at the start of the phase where you take actions. The cost of your action depends on the relative value of your priority token to the value of the market. Sometimes, it is free (but a late action) or early, which costs a lot. Money is very tight so this is a tense decision. 

The sail/explore action and the scoring of the points is not very intuitive, but incredibly important. I didn't figure it out until very late in the game. 

I'm a bit torn on this game. I thought the mechanics were very interesting but they were so divorced from the theme, that it made it very non-intuitive.

It's a great german game, all about strategic planning and tactical reactions.
The "numbered actions" twist is unique, and everything runs smoothly. The action is tense, and there is a lot of interactions and things to care about.
The real gem of Essen 2009.
After 5-6 plays, it may lack a little in overtime replayability (after 7-8 plays you will likely feel the need for an expansion).

This is a worker-placement game with a very interesting twist regarding player order.  It's not a no-brainer to take the first action, because there is a cost associated with it.  Instead there is some risk analysis that goes into the timing of actions.  Good stuff.

The twist on the worker placement mechanism is great. however, I don't really enjoy that game since you have nearly no feel of progress. In other words the last round really feels like the first one. I prefer games where you build an engine of some kind. Therefore I prefer the classic wp games like Agricola, Caylus, AOE 3, etc.

A worker-placement game with with an awful lot going on, which for the most part is a good thing. Every placement feels crucial, which again is good. And despite a lot of distinct areas and actions, the game doesn't feel fiddly, yet another strong point. Despite this, Vasco da Gama feels a bit forced, clunky and inelegant. The biggest cause, I think, are the placement numbers, which function well for resolving actions in a specific order but don't blend well with the theme.It also seems like the starting point for the action cost marker randomly moving up or down by three spaces - in effect a six-space swing - lobs a huge gob of luck into the proceedings. Given the length and intensity of the game, such large swings in luck seem out of place. Vasco da Gama is solid and deep, but hardly innovative or standout. Will gladly continue to play this for a while, but I'm guessing this will never rise above a 6 or 7 rating for me.

RATING: 7
Clever Euro game for 2-4 players. Turn order is very important so one must try to outmaneuver one's opponents to get the good stuff before they can. One can always try to take a risk by grabbing a low number hoping the modifier is a negative one, so there is the possibility of risk taking to come from behind. One problem with the game is that one can easily get out of the running if one forgets to collect enough captains for the ships. Very nice and functional components, if not a little fiddly.

First Impression:

A worker placement euro with an interesting risk management mechanic.

The game flows well, and it is fun to time the ship building process. Each round is also tough, and eventually you'll have to push your luck a bit to win.

The theme is good but the intergration not so. Not a very inspiring game, but not a boring one either. The ship progress part is a bit hard to teach to new players.

All in all I'd like to play again.

OK so I had a pretty good time with this game. Enjoyed the quite a bit in fact. I have concerns over replay at this point as there is really only the one way to score points. It's my belief that an expansion is already in progress and we'll have to see if that improves on that aspect of it. Until then well it was fun. 

UPDATE: After a few plays I feel the replayability problem I was concerned with has revealed itself to be true. Man the WP mechanic is so cool though I would love to see this implemented in another game with a better base game as well.

In Vasco da Gama you buy crew, captains and ship "projects" which you then use to send expeditions which give you a one-time point bonus, a variable one-time "stuff" bonus, either a few coins or points per turn, and potential points bonuses if your ship forms a completed "landing" with other ships.

There are a few neat mechanisms in the game, most notably the action resolution order, where you pick a number between 1 and 20 and assign it to your action disk when you do your worker placement phase.  Actions resolve in number order.  However, each turn there will be a new "spot" number.  If you pick an action below the spot number, you'll have to pay the difference to resolve the action.  For example, if the spot is 7 and you chose 4, it will cost you 3 coins... and money is a little tight.  Additionally, you know that the spot will start at 7 but it will be randomly modified up to 3 higher or 3 lower.  So sometimes you can take a lower number and get lucky.  If you choose a number above the spot it's free.  And you can always choose to forgo your action and get a booby prize of 1, 2 or 3 coins (higher numbers get you better payouts).  

Another neat mechanism is the recruiting action.  There are a few places to recruit crew, none of which have more than 5 crew available.  You need crewmen of different colors to send your expeditions.  When you buy crew, you can take all the crewmen of one color from a depot for 1 buck, all of two colors for 3 bucks, all of 3 for 6, etc. Additionally, you can hire a captain for however many crewmen you bought (so never more than five).

And finally there are roles in the game, every player starts with one, but it's possible to steal roles away from other players and to have as many as you want.  The roles do powerful things like give you start player and points, give you a new color of crewmen which is unavailable anywhere else, give you an extra action disk per turn, or give you a free merchant ship to send out, which isn't quite as cool as having your own ship, but is a lot less work.

I liked the game quite a bit.  Its detractors are going to say it's "Just another soulless Euro" with a few neat mechanisms tacked on... and I guess I can't argue with that too much, but I like it despite that.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=41002][/thing] is a game that could be just like a thousand other euros - use actions to hire workers, use them to make something and use this something to net you points -  A to B to C. [thing=41002][/thing] has this - it is basically all you will be doing during play. Yet, there are to twists that bring the game a step further, setting it apart for the crowd.

First, and most relevant, is the action order. There are tokens, going from 1 to 20, that will determin the order in which the actions around the board will be done. Each round, a card will tell where to place a pawn among the action tokens. Say it is in the number 8. Then the first player will take a token. But which one? The lower the number, the sooner and action will be made, and this is very important to grab the sailors, ships, characters or spot in the travel, that you most want. Yet, you need to know that, once everyone has taken the tokens they and placed them in the spots around the board, a card will be revealed, moving the pawn from +3 (which would send it to 11, in me example) to -3 (to 5) - there also also +2 (x2), +1, 0, -1 and -2 (x2). What this means? Well, actions [u]above[/u] the number, pay nothing to be used. Actions [u]bellow[/u] pay the difference between the current number to the token I got. Thus, if I took a 6, and the pawn moved to 10, I will have to spend $4 to use the action in the place I put the 6 token. Since money is rather tight in the game, this is a major concern. You normally want to do actions as early as possible, yet you don't want to pay at all for them.

This rather simple rule creates a lot of tension, fun, thought and interaction in [thing=41002][/thing], and is truly the heart of the game. It makes for several different turn orders, in different places on the board. The game could be meaner, and make the person pay if they can, which would turn this into a tough game - however, this would likely make people play much safer, which would take out much of the drama in the game. Thus players can forego the action and receive an amount of money (from 1 to 3, depending on the number of the token) - this often isn't good, but is better than mess your whole turn.

The second twist is in the travels. Ships are put in places on the board - the ships have number, and the higher, the best - but these normally cost more crew to be put in the sea, or have smaller rewards for staying in the sea. Anyway, the main twist is that ships can start in a place and then travel forward, if they can, otherwise they will leave and only the captain will return. Advancing and positiong is key in doing well in a play of [thing=41002][/thing], since this is the main source of points. Ships that stay in the sea can give income of money and points, both very good, and is of the interest of the players to keep the ships there for as long as possible. Also, when a port is full, bonus points will be awared for each ship there, making their owners quite happy. Thus planning to have two or three of your ships reaching the same port and making it full, is not only satisfying, but also gives a reward of many points.

Yes, although [thing=41002][/thing] was these twists, it is still "just" and euro. You take things to have other things and grab points. Yet, the action tokens and the dispute at the sea give a levity and entertainment not often found in the genre, usually plagued by dry options. [thing=41002][/thing] ends up ahead of the pack, being smart, with a nice pace, lots of options and interaction. Recommended.

Very intriguing mechanism... the rules do sound complicated but the play itself isn't really hard to understand (but maybe hard to master). All in all one of the highlights of 2009. It's sad though that it's not published in more countries, yet. Otherwise I'd say it'd have a chance to enter the list of nominees for "Spiel des Jahres 2010 /Game of the year 2010".

Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships. And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory.
This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:
Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship.
The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won.

Another action selection/worker placement game, but this time with more opportunities to mess with other players' plans than in a game of Agricola or Pillars Of The Earth. When choosing a trade route for your ship(s) or by placing a merchant ship, you often have the opportunity to shut other players out of a profitable completion or otherwise determine the fate of their ships. The risk taking part of placing numbered actions is an interesting mechanism. Furthermore, the board and counters are big, colourful and sturdy, making the game nice to behold. Not sure how much replayability the game offers, but I am really enjoying it sofar.

Regardless of the dry theme, VdG is actually a fine, solid Euro. There is nothing spectacularly new about this worker placement game, but the sequence of how turn order is determined for each action is relatively fresh. I haven't seen any game where worker placement is determined in sequence based on variable costs. So while you would like to go first, you may possibly have to pay more. The luck of the draw comes from trying to determine the risk of taking an action that may end up costing more upon revealing the modifier. While that may sound quite luck driven, one can still reasonably calculate the chances of being dinged by the modifier and make preparations (such as holding on to more money) to pay for the action. Of note, I particularly love how the value of the captain is determined by the total cost of the crew purchased. This simple mechanic is enough to cause some considerable heartaches and groans of pain.

Overall, Vasco da Gama is a good if not great game that is in line with the other  dry, themeless Euros out there.  Go get em!

You know what?  Here's a soulless, generic, pasted-on-theme euro that has mechanics that are interesting enough to sustain it, at least through the one play I've had thusfar.  Despite all of Vasco's weaknesses, I found myself really engaged and interested in what was going on.  The mechanics are not so simplistic that it feels like clockwork when I turn my discs into cubes into cardboard tiles into victory points.  The timing system of this game is quite unique, with only the truly awful [gameid=5406] having anything similar in my experience, and Vasco's system is so much more intricate and nuanced as to make it almost unrecognizable.

I don't know what Tom Vasel is smoking, this is an excellent game. So many agonizing decisions in a short time: press your luck with which turn number to take, which ships to buy, do you go for multi colours of crewman, driving up your captain cost, or skip the captain, where to launch your ship for best current and future points, how will that affect your opponent's launching...

Commented after one game. We were all newbies and going through the rules took a while. The game itself felt quite nice, but the mechanics are so heavy, that you must play it frequently to remember the rules and play fluently. Let's see if I have possibilities for that. Definitely too heavy for casual players.

I like the mechanics in this game, the components are good and so on. Theme is a little bit pasted up in some points, but are ok in average.

Updated after second game and almost year later. A good game, but it will need a proper group to play with. Lots of rules and different mechanics over basic idea: buy ships, hire crew, set the ships to sail and ask for a favor once in a while.

Vasco da Gama is a fairly straight forward Euro design. If it wasn't for the incredibly clever worker placement innovation, it would have had little chance of sticking around. Everything feels artificially tight and most rounds find you having exactly enough money to do one thing at each station. 

If that sounds like an overly engineered nightmare of drudgery to you, I'm sure your not alone. For me though, I think the push your luck worker placement is just interesting enough to make it all worth while. Players place their workers with an initiative token, the earlier in the round the token lets you act, the more expensive it is. Unlike most worker placements that feature denial as player interaction, this one allows players acting later in turn order to jump in front of a another player that placed earlier in the turn. The catch is that jumping in front will cost a variable amount of money, which is not determined until after the decision has been made. In other words, on top of "bidding" for actions, their is a fair bit of push-your-luck on what the price of those bids will ultimately be!

This fluctuating turn order is a fascinating wrinkle in the worker placement formula, one that is so good, it makes the rest of the mostly forgettable mechanics worth exploring.

I generally dislike worker placement games where there are separate phases for placing your workers and then another for actually using them. I feel like why act out the same thing twice. Here, the mechanism has some interesting stuff to it, but it's also coupled with a push your luck game as to how much each worker will cost. I love push your luck but not in a heavy euro. The game also has a unique area controlish part, where it's possible that your actions give other players up to 10% of their final points, or kill their ships. It's rather chaotic. We played with four, sure, and I see that the game would get less chaotic with less players but then again, the worker placement is fiddly and really random with the prices and the game overall, while having some unique stuff, isn't that good. It has minimal engine building too, and no player powers (you can influence nobles for special abilities but those can be taken away the next turn)

very clever mechanics for gaining the iniative: it's the pivot of all the game. there's a good interaction among players when you try to steal good spots for your workers and be the first in choosing something, leaving worse choices to the last players.
There is a relevant amount of rules to learn before start but after the first two turns i would say everything is quite clear. It's better to play it a second time to better appreciate it.
There are probably different paths to victory but i still have to find them: they are not so relevantly separated.
Timing in executing the correct action is paramount.
A bit too heavy-weighted for my tastes but great game I am proud to have tested before it was edited

In the spirit of Vasco da Gama's explorations, we are aspiring Portugese ship owners in a race to develop the seafaring trade routes along the coast of Africa and along the Middle East. Build ships, assemble captain and crew, and arrange expeditions during an unstable economy back home. The game was my first experience with adding initiative number tokens with a push your luck component to secure first player and turn order--awesome.

5 Plays and it took 5 plays to get the rules 100% right. Many of the rule subtleties for shipping in particular, changed the game considerably and made for a very tense and exciting game when played right. Unfortunately, my copy has not hit the table since then. Last game I managed to pull off the win and enjoyed it very much. So I hope to keep it but I'll be mindful to preread the game before it hits the table in future to get the rules right.

I really liked this one. Lots of options each turn. You have to get ships and men to run them, decide where to sail, and take a chance with turn order costs. Very clever.

The very last copy sold at Essen 2009 (on Sunday at 5 p.m., a full day after it sold out) - was lucky to get it after accidentally being at the What's your game? booth at just the moment when they realized one preordered copy had not been picked up.

Workerplacement game with a twist on what action are first taken.

Managing building ships and sending them out to deliver to different ports.

My boyfriend got this for my for Christmas and I like it quite a lot. I'm  Portuguese , and have a Master's in History...so this fits the genre bill quite nicely. Great mechanics, easy enough to learn, and works with 2 better than most medium weight games tend to. Good times.

Inoffensive and diverting, but I will never understand this randomness fad in worker placement games, e.g. Pillars "don't place in sequence, pull from a bag instead," Stone Age's "roll dice to collect" and Vasco's "[+3,-3] worker cost swing, revealed after workers are placed" mechanic. Role selection embroiled in worker placement is an interesting twist but the roles are really just extensions of the areas already on the board, not unique rule-breakers. Just not seeing what this offers over Age/Caylus.

There is so much to do in this game, but so little resources to get it done. The only thing worth any points is getting ships to navigate toward India. But you have to acquire the ship, crew the ship, and navigate the ship. Competition for board location becomes a balance of money with some risk involved: do I take a lower numbered disk but risk the 'free' marker moving positive making that action cost more? Or take a higher number and hope the 'free' marker does increase forcing my opponent to spend more? There some strategies to ship placement that both my wife and I were just starting to see near the end of the game - placing lower gives less points, but may become a suitable block preventing your opponent from placing any ship. All-in-all a very enjoyable experience that I hope to play again soon.

This can be a very brutal game. I understand that you need to plan out your moves and identify when is a good time to go first; however, there are so many things to do with limited resources that one small screw up, in or out of your control, and you can be set back with no way of catching up. Some people like these kinds of games, but I find them fun only occasinally, if ever.

5 after 1 play

Game mechanic is ok, though parts of it feel unnecessary, e.g. the granularity of the bidding order doesn't make too big a difference in most of the decisions. The game mechanic also does not gel well with the theme, leaving it rather dry and soulless. Player interaction is mostly indirect and not high. Artwork is ok. Game component quality is good, though the captains are tiny.

I was a bit scared off by Tom V's review for over 2 years, but I knew deep down inside that I would like this game, and I did!...I like the worker placement/action selection mechanism that forces you to gamble a little to get the actions in the order you want, great 'sailing in renaissance times' game!

I loved my first game of it at Spiel 2009, and while I haven't played it much since, it still holds up. I expected a fairly standard eurogame, with a somewhat boring theme, but found much more. The worker placement mechanic combined with the variable phase order is a lot of fun, and lowers the chances of analysis paralysis.

RATING: 7.5
The artwork on this game is fantastic, that’s not the most important reason to buy a game, but it is something that (almost) everyone looks at. It’s simply called the first impression. If you don’t like the atmosphere a game shows you, there’s a big chance you won’t buy the game. What’s more important, is how the game plays. And that’s something you can’t see by looking to the box. There’s  a lot of interaction in this game due to the placing of the numbered discs into the numbers area. And the placing of the numbers is a big deal. Here comes the tactics into the game. Heres comes the line in your head: “If I place this one, then he/she has to go for that one at least.” After placing the numbered discs, players take their actions. This is where the game becomes just another worker placement game. Expect for the mechanism of the numbered discs, which determines the order of playing, there is not much special about this game. Just a very descent typical Euro-game.

Entretenido y bueno. Quizás el problema es que no terminas de saber del todo si vas bien o mal, y el último turno puede ser muy decisivo.

Update 26 March 2017

Its not as bad as Tom Vasel says it is.  But its still pretty mediocre and dry.

I've played this game about 3 times, and the first time I played it actually I liked it.  However by the 3rd time I realised it isn't that good of a game.

The main problem I found is that its totally unclear what the characters do, how they resolve, when they resolve; in some cases, such as the start player marker, they seem damn near broken.     

These characters had should have been second-nature to use/understand.  This lack of clarity had me referring to the rule book every time a query came up about how the characters worked, and then wondering if I even got it right.

I even feel they could have done with a "reservation" system, such as you can reserve the character for the next round; get its benefit but you need to keep claiming it to reserve it; this would have been much better.

In addition I found the rule book to be lackluster and overwhelming for its compacted words, lots of pages and feeling that it just didn't flow correctly, or was poorly edited; I do wish it was 100% clear on how the characters worked.

The game itself is about getting ships, getting crew & captains and setting sail for various ports in the Indian ocean to the final destination; India.

At its heart a player must time their "orders" using sequential numbers to plan out actions to try in a push your luck mechanic.

This push your luck mechanic is mechanically similar to the Provost in Caylus; where the economic marker moves left or right to indicate the cost of performing orders.

I liked the whole getting ships, getting crew, setting sail; and I think it'd make for a good theme for a pirate game if one were to design such a game.

In summary, I feel the game has some good points; but the way the characters work and dryness of the game really hurts it and although I probably would play it again if in the mood, it is not something I want to play any time soon.

Overall: 5/10.

Feels a lot like Caylus, except that the track has been replaced by numbers scattered all over the board.  Amazing bits quality: Four different types of wooden pieces in at least nine different colors.  Mostly intuitive, except for the character tiles which are mildly confusing in effect and timing.

Very interesting!  Speculating how that ±3 fluctuation in the [i]first free action[/i] is going to affect the turn is an extremely brutal, but fascinating mechanism.  Also, the progression of the ships along the course proves quite fascinating, as well.

Good impression after first game. The order number selection is the innovative bit of the whole package, and works well. Above all it has been entertaining to see "old school" worker-placement guys struggling with the idea of order of placing being partially disconnected with order of activation, which is also neat. Totally disconnected from any possible theme - if you ask me - but neat.

One gripe that I could foresee about the game, is the fact that there's really only one major way of scoring points, and I believe you could actually perform very well by using a single strategy throughout the game.

There are few ways of messing with the opponents, but they can be effective.

There is some sense of micro-progression, but it feels scripted (you get a ship plan, you get your crew, you get your captain, and then you send the ship to sail). Also there's a total lack of macro-progression, apart from the bigger ships being available and the upper spots of the docks being occupied.

I'd give it another go any day, but it's not a game that I feel the need to own.

After 1 Play: Utterly lifeless.  There's a selection of things to do, none of which are new, or interesting, or fun.  But wait, I also get to spend a bunch of time bidding on what exact order I get to do these boring things in.

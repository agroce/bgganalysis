This is an awesome game. Both sides of the battle feel different. The Free Peoples feels like you're really orchestrating something, using all of your assets at your disposal wisely, a little behind the eight-ball, but looking ahead to relief down the fate track. The shadow army knows that they've got to take everything they can get. They've got to amass some troops and get the ball rolling as quickly as possible. It's less about pulling strings and more about quick movement and underhanded tactics and events. I can't wait to play more and more of this game to see and feel all of its variety and permutations.

RATING: 10
A fresh view of the War of the Ring rules and in my view the best thematic Hobbit game. It plays faster once you get a few turns under your belt but quite a lot of the key mechanics (e.g. action dice) are largely the same. There are character cards with special abilities for all characters and the battle is done via a great mechanic that weakens each army on each round as it would happen in reality and not with a big bang with special abilities of units also used when you get high die rolls. And I love the arc of range that is used with Gandalf and Thranduil's special abilities to hit enemies farther than a few regions away. There is the sense of monsters coming into the valley from everywhere and you try to hold on for as long as possible until the strong allies come to the rescue, it is a lot more narrow in its winning conditions and story (it depicts one battle in Hobbit and the build up to it) which makes it slightly less of an epic (compared to War of the Ring) but a lot more tactical. I can see it hitting the table a lot more than War of the Ring simply because you can get it finished in a few hours and each turn could bring a significant change in the overall outcome as I found War of the Ring being a bit too long with some turns bringing little impact to plans. I love both games for different reasons.

De um modo geral, eu evito jogos de dois jogadores porque eles raramente veem mesa, ou nunca tem a oportunidade, o que é mais comum.

Como me desfiz da maioria dos meus bons jogos de dois jogadores, decidi adquirir este através de uma troca (Dead of Winter) e deixar ele guardado na coleção até a hora certa de jogar. Sem pressa.

Próxima meta é conseguir um exemplar da Guerra do Anel, dos mesmos autores.

Este jogo, mesmo tendo um tempo de jogo bem extenso, é uma ótima experiência na mesa.

Update: agora a coleção com os jogos do trio de autores italianos está completa (Batalha, Guerra e Conan) e este aqui já viu mais de uma partida e por mim pode ver mesa pelo menos uma vez a cada bimestre.

O jogo é uma versão "fast play" de Guerra do Anel e transcorre de maneira bem menos tensa do que seu antecessor. As regras são mais fáceis de assimilar, porém como ele é um jogo de Defesa de Torre voce basicamente tem que sobreviver do jeito certo até a ajuda chegar ou atacar sem dó nem piedade se for jogar com o lado do mal. O sistema de combate eu achei que poderia ter sido melhor desenvolvido, mas nada que atrapalhe na diversão final.

Um ótimo jogo com uma produção impecável.

Played two partial learning games and one full game. I need to try it more before settling on a judgement for this game.  While I like it, I also feel a bit of a disconnect from it.  Likely because it's not as engrossing as WotR.

War of the Ring without the journey of the ring-bearer to Mount Doom wouldn’t be an appetising a prospect, as Battles of the Third Age proved.  Battle of Five Armies does look an awful lot like its parent.  It also recycles the fate track that Third Age used to replace the journey of the ring-bearer as a means of putting the Shadow Faction under time pressure.  That does its job well enough and I like the idea that the less active the Free People’s generals are, the quicker help is likely to arrive…and be needed.  I’m not sure what the end point of the track is supposed to represent, but then I haven’t read The Hobbit so it may make perfect thematic sense.  As ever, the Free People are outnumbered and under pressure from the start.

Enough of the similarities; the good news is that Five Armies is quite a different game.  The most significant difference is in its treatment of combat, which brings more detail, as befits a game that’s about a single battle rather than War of the Ring’s continent-spanning campaign. At heart it’s got Columbia’s buckets of dice system, but it adds some card play and factors in both terrain superiority and leadership.  Then there is damage, which armies simply absorb until they reach a tipping point, beyond which they rapidly disintegrate.  This all works satisfyingly well.  What’s also novel is that as the game progresses the Free People gain some pretty tough allies who are well able to give the forces of evil a bloody nose.    Five Armies appears to offer both sides strategic choices, while the action dice, event, story and fate cards add a touch of luck and variation.  

Production quality and artwork are up to the good standards of the rest of this series.  The miniatures fall short of the stellar standards of Blood Rage, but they’re fine.  The rules are actually better than I have learned to expect from this source.  For once, downloading Universal Head’s summary does not feel a necessity.

This is a big epic 2 player game based on the final battle in the Hobbit. It takes a lot of work to learn and teach but if youre looking to get lost in the world of Lord of the Rings and want to have a big epic battle of wit and strategy commanding trolls and orcs against elves and men, this is the game for you. Id rate it higher except that it doesnt get to table much due to its size.

Visually and mechanically similar to its older sibling, War of the Ring, Battle is a bit faster to learn, shorter and lighter. Asymmetrical play which takes a few rounds to master, there are lots of decisions based on the nifty Action Dice rolls, and Story and Event cards which can shape the course of the battle towards or away from the flow of the original Hobbit novel. Heroes come out as the fate advances, and the two sides tend to play evenly though they require different conditions for victory and acquiring the spare Action Die. I like it a lot, not so much as its predecessor but this is honestly more likely to come out, since it's strictly 2 player. A great Risk-like quality to it, with far better decision making and game play. Nice minis, too.

Lots to like here as far as production value, gameplay, and fun. Too many things to like to list here, but the combat system is fun.  And the action dice - I never understood why more games haven't used that, but maybe I'm just nuts for dice.  Needs a compendium to supplement the base rulebook.  1 game under my belt and it was a 6+ hour slog, but I hardly noticed the time as it flew by since I was enjoying myself so much. Should decrease with experience, but if my this would be another knock against it.

The Battle of Five Armies is my favorite scenario from all of Tolkein.  The early tension between the elves, the two groups of dwarves, and the men, eventually forced together against the goblin forces, is extremely entertaining and full of possibilities.

Yet this features none of that early tension and in-fighting - everyone is united against the goblins.  The shadow player doesn't even get cards allowing dwarves and elves to kill one another if in the same space (for example), which could have been a nice bit of tension for the FP player.  It is a shame.  Most of the interesting narrative of the battle is removed - and it is the narrative which I find interesting in this type of game, much moreso than the gameplay itself.

This is WotR without the central tension - to push the ring forward, or to defend militaristically.  There is little even to do in terms of long-term strategies; mostly it is pure tactics.  There is very little one can do to influence the fate track, no option to spend an action bumping it up or down, or reducing/increasing the number of fate tiles (e.g. play a card which forces the shadow player to take n-1 tiles or the opposite) while 1 tiles are easy to find.  There are similarly few options for the FP player to place recruitment tokens on the board - you are entirely beholden to lucky cards and the generals' abilities.

I really like the way the fate track brings out important characters, as well as the generals' abilities (esp Gandalf and the Archers).  But I would prefer to see some of those mechanics get integrated into WotR as part of an expansion rather than play this otherwise lackluster game again.

Ultimately, my conclusion (after one play) is that this is a game which doesn't need to exist, and it mainly should only appeal only to people who have played WotR to death and want to play something with a similar feel (which is likely a relatively small number of people..).

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Not as good as War of the ring, but if this one can really be played in 90min, this one has a good chance of sticking around.  I love the action dice mechanism, although what you role seems much more important in this one than War of the Ring.  This one does seem more tactical in nature than War of the ring, and plays different enough that it seems fine to own both.  Looking forward to more plays.  Like its predecessor, a lot to take in on your first play!

Wasn't originally too interested in this, but since we have loved War of the Ring I picked it up in a trade.

It isn't nearly as epic, but it plays faster and is enjoyable.

Epical experience. The designers have outdone themselves, even considering the solid treatment they have shown with War of the Ring. Such a rich, thematic game, that pushes you to the limit with tactical decisions that keep you engaged every turn.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable dudes-on-a-map game, but to call it a War of the Ring "killer" is a disservice to both games, given that aside from the dice-based action allocation system (and the theme) the two are largely distinct games. BotFA focusses entirely on combat, and is very enjoyable in its comparative simplicity. It still oozes theme, and the miniatures, cards and artwork etc all maximise this experience - and certain mechanisms within the game mean its consistent comparison to WotR is unsurprising - but this is a mechanically solid and richly thematic game in its own right (as is WotR!).

Given the slightly easier rules and the clarity in their strategic application offered by the games less embellished focus on combat, there is a wider availability of people and opportunities to play the game, which is a plus. However, whenever I get the urge to play a game of this type I am instantly drawn to War of the Ring instead, despite its longer play time and added complexity and strategic depth. For now, BotFA still has a well-deserved spot in my collection and, in theory, should be regarded as a great game in its own right as it is definitely not a "streamlined version" of WotR; however, unfortunately it does seem to be living in the shadow of WotR on my shelves, anyway. For this reason, its rating has dropped ever so slightly over time.

Took an amazing thematic game and turned it into a pretty generic war game. There is still a lot of theme in the cards and in the way certain units/allies come out, but this doesn't come close to capturing the epic story of War of the Ring. The theme is also admittedly far less interesting: WotR retells a story that unfolds over three books, while BoFA covers only a few pages of the Hobbit. Not a bad game (and one that mercifully plays in 1/4 of the time of its predecessor), but not one I can see myself requesting a lot.

Much better than the battle games in the Battles of the Third Age expansion; it better be, I guess. A few things about this game still feel weird to me; the Fate track is totally gamey, Bilbo is vastly overpowered given he didn't actually do anything, and I wish the pace of the game was quicker. A little bit too much time is spent screwing around with recruiting and moving armies over large distances with relatively brief flurries of combat; it feels like a campaign, not a battle. The narrative PoV is also very Free People-centric, which is fine I guess since tactically Azog is in the driver's seat, but it could be better. Die rolls and card draws can also be kind of arbitrarily swingy. While not totally insubstantial, these are all still comparatively minor gripes; BoFA overall plays pretty well and feels much smoother than any of its predecessors including (for me) War of the Ring. Play time comes in comfortably under 3 hours, possibly even under 2 with some experience, so that's a huge win. I enjoyed playing it and would play it again, but not a game I need to own.

Great game.  Having never played War of the Ring I can imagine this is a bit less epic in scope/feel, but the action dice system works great and the cardplay in battles is excellent.  Really dig the reverance given to the source material; everything acts as it should with little touches of brilliance.

Difficult battle to simulate so I thought this did a great job. Dark power under pressure of time as the Fate deck grinds on and the Free Peoples gain their heroes. Lots of flavoursome events, unit differentiation, and an interesting arena for the battle. Lots of tough decisions. Timing and sequence seems important, as the Eagles and Beorn can be devastating, but not always, unless you wait for the best time to strike. Fun stuff

End at the 5th round...fate at 6...SP 6 marks
End of the 6 round...SP 10 marks win!  SP focus on pushing in Eastern spur and Camp to stop the reinforecement of FP.  After gatherig the overwhelming wave of goblins in the foot of the Front Gate, FP is busy to move the army of elf from Fallen Bridge and Ravenhill to Frontgate.  Finally, the Fallen Bridge is fallen and ruined by the goblin in the west.  Great game!
SP got Fallen bridge and Ravenhill in the 6th round in last 2 turns.

FP won. Bolg came to the battle in the 3rd round without sufficient support from SP.  It became the target of bring attscked.  FP focused on attacking the Bolg and defected him in the 5th round. Game over after Bolg was eliminated!

20160221
SP Won.  SP quickly attacked the Ruins of Dali and Bolg came out with strong healing power.  FP cannot hold the 
CAMP and Fallen River.  Although SP supports are far too long to go to the Iron Gate, SP played some powerful event cards to strengthen attack and muster in other cities.  The noble eagles and skin-changer were coming a little bit late so SP won finally at the end of 10/12 in FP score track.

Fun game, easy to learn if you have played was of the ring, faster paced with lis of variation and chrome thrown in.  Balance seems solid unlike what others have said I think the free peoples have an equal shot at winning.  Shadow player had to play very aggressive, while free peoples player needs to survive the first free turns.  I think it's good, not great.  I would rather play war of the ring or a war game.  Frankly most war games these days are just a easy to learn and play with a similar play time.  First game will take 3+ hours with setup.

A provisional rating based on one play - lots of tough decisions to make and a fair amount of strategic options to pursue. The Shadow player needs to move fast and the Free peoples player needs to pick his battles carefully and hope that the bear arrives asap.

An attempt to create a tactical War of the Ring, themed on The Battle of Five Armies, near the end of The Hobbit.  Fine game, mechanically sound, but ultimately quite same-y with suspected limited replayability.  The strategic options and grandeur of the parent game make this a lesser product.  Production quite disappointing too - muddy, muted game board, aroma of cheap printing, game board refuses to sit flat.

This game has some nice systems, but I'm not yet convinced of its long term replayability.  It's not exactly scripted, but it seems that the mechanisms are definitely trying to enforce a certain narrative arc.  The shadow player washes over the land like a red tide, but as the game progresses the free peoples acquire superpowers that allow them to push back.  I do have concerns that either you play out the intended narrative and end up with a close-fought finish, or one side has some lopsided luck and short-circuits the story.  I have been enjoying exploring the game though.  It will take some more plays before I can decide if the game has legs.  

Update Jan 2015 (after 5 plays)
At first, this game felt very lucky and swingy, exspecially around the Fate track.  However, with more plays, I am realizing that the fate track is actually more balanced than it appears (much like the movement of the Fellowship in War of the Ring).  The FP player can sacrifice activations for the CHANCE to accelerate the fate track, much like he can push the fellowship for the CHANCE of moving them faster without damage.  And the Fate card mechanism somewhat balances out slow movement of the fate marker - when your characters do eventually come out, they will be stronger if more fate cards have been drawn.  

I think the game feels a lot like when the FP go for a military victory in War of the Ring. There's a lot of reliance on tricky movement across the map and attacking the enemy's weak spots.  The game has clearly undergone extensive development and offers many finely tuned options to the players.  As I adjust my expectations and accept the game for what it is rather than my preconceptions, I am enjoying it more. 

The cards are a big improvement over the tokens used for orders in Battles of the Third Age.  There are a few component issues however.  The combat dice are pretty chintzy (I've replaced them), then damage tokens are very unfortunate (I've sub'ed in wooden cubes), and how successful is this line of games going to be need be before they can make armies in more than just two colors (I may need to paint some bases at least)?

UPDATE June 2015 (after 8 plays)
OK, I am back to feeling that while the game does offer a lot of choices, the impact of those choices is too dominated by luck.  Now that I've finally seen a game or two that saw Beorn come out and fight for a while, I think I've seen most of the game's tricks and am ready to move on.  

I contrast this to War of the Ring, where I've got over 50 plays in, and the game still manages to surprise me.  WotR has luck, but I rarely feel like luck is the dominating factor in the outcome.  

So where I think I am ending up on B5A is that it has some nice ideas and is fun to explore, but ultimately has too much luck to be deeply satisfying and is too beholden to its narrative to have long-term replayability.

Final update July 2015
I decided to give the game one more try with fresh eyes, and I am definitely done.  There really aren't all that many strategies to try, and whether or not you succeed depends upon luck upon luck upon luck.  The game does a great job of telling a narrative, but it's more a narrative you watch to see how it turns out than one you actively control.  That's not what I am looking for in a game of this depth and length.  This isn't sour grapes, either, I won the game!  It pains me, but I think I need to drop my rating a point (to a 6) on the way out.

A very faithful representation of the battle from the book.  You might say it has less narrative than War Of The Ring, but this represents one chapter, not three books.   The multiple victory conditions keeps the game on a tight rope and the Fate track is perfectly executed.  The tension in the game is high. Has enough new/different elements from WOTR to make it fresh and worth owning both if you're going to play it a lot, which I likely will.  One of the best new games I've played in 2014.

It's only slightly shorter than WOTR and only slightly less complex.  I can't really believe they are putting 60 minutes on the box when 120-180 mins is more like the truth.   Once again the rulebook is far too verbose and makes the game seem harder than it is, but on the other hand it is thoroughly complete and has a lot of examples.

Epic in scope and very thematic, TBoFA offers an immersive gaming experience. Fans of the Hobbit mythos and the battle genre will like this game immensely as long as they are willing to invest the significant time required to learn the rules. Once the rules are absorbed, game play is not overly complicated.

Complicated and we messed up some rules bug time. It wasn't very fun because of that and I got stopmed harder and quicker than I would have probably. I'm sure I'd like it a lot more when playing it again knowing whats going on, but it was frustrating at times. I'll play again but so far there's some other big ones I like more.

Good game. Does an excellent job of putting both players in the battle told in the last chapter of the Hobbit. I feel it is a bit unbalanced so if both players are of equal skill the free people's army will win more often than not.

Takes the original action dice system from War of the Ring and builds in a more granular combat system.  I like the game and the situation presented feels fluid and balanced. I'm not sure the rationale of the Free Peoples force randomly appearing via recruitment tokens.  Seems like you should be able to pick which units arrive where.  Production is top notch and as beautiful as War of the Ring itself.

This is a great game based in the War of the Ring universe.  Other than the Action Dice mechanic and some of the respective actions, a lot of this game is updated for the Hobbit story. The battle system is almost all new, and I really like it! The card-driven battle system that is unit contingent is really fun to work with and creates quite a bit of tension in the battle system. Battles can get quite a bit lucky with the dice throws, but that is only an issue when a bad roll does nothing or a good roll decimates your Army! The Hobbit flavour is perfect as well and all the other mechanics are simple and make the game flow very well. WotR has several, large components in it that you have to keep track of and that makes for a more epic, heavy experience.  Bo5A has the Battle system and the Character system, but otherwise the other mechanics don't get in the way.  Just a great game and I commend the designers for being able to blend familiar WotR mechanics with all new, legitimate game mechanics that give it a feeling all its own. Good stuff here!

I own the first expansion for War of the Ring, that included two battles: Helm's Deep and Minas Tirith. This game follows the path traced by those games, borrowing several mechanics from the "mother" game. They are fast and enjoying games, but they do not reach the magnificence of War of the Ring.

RATING: 5.75
Preliminary rating after one game.
Our first game lasted for exactly 2 rounds.  Yes only rolling those action dice twice !
The red player (shadows)  overran the blue player (humans and elbes) completely.
A horrible dysbalance of powers. All fights were 5vs1 or 5vs2. So no chance for the blue player to defend himself.  Even as the outcome of such combats were clear in advance, we had to roll dice for about ten minutes to make a rules correct combat resolution. This is a tedious way of designing a combat to feel epic.
 And we both could not figure out how to blue player could do better (as he recruited on every occasion). Maybe just bad dice rolls? No.
Conclusion: first scenario is rubbish, too easy for the shadows to win.
Game rating red player 8
Game rating blue player 3.5
On average = 5.75
Will play again with sides changed or another scenario for final opinion.
Second play was opposite, it dragged on for 4 hours.
Another problem: this game consists of only one scenario... Not that high replay value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Different enough from War of the Rings to be considered separately, but just barely. The spirit is different, however. WOTR wants quite seriously to be a simulation. It has many rules which are terrible from a game design standpoint, but for which there is a logic leading right back to a palpable love of Tolkien's trilogy, and a desire to simulate entire tale into board game form. It's a crazy and charming thing to do.

Battle, on the other hand, is first and foremost a cover version of WOTR. It bears none of the same love or crazy ambition. It is just a war game with mind-bogglingly complex rules for combat.

Don't buy games based on movies, comic books, video games or novels. They're most of time just made for a quick buck and they are highly unlikely to be good games. (It's how I start my shopping for a new game) The War of the Ring board game is a good example, a not so good game, as well as World of Warcraft one too. War of the ring was a bad game to make a quick buck. 

Although, the designers learned a few things since its release, and have improved their game system. Battle of the five armies is a better game than the war of the ring. It's simpler than the other one, easier to understand, and setup doesn't take as long. But I still think it's not that good and VERY expensive. I mean, almost 100$ for a board game for 2 players is like hugely expensive! I'd rather play chess than this, you can get one for 10$ and it's filled with strategy. But to stay in board games, I prefer playing the complex squad leader game than this game, even if it a REAL complicated game with tons of rules. I have more fun with that game than Battle of the 5 armies.

And I think it is definitively not worth that much money, especially for a 2 player game like I said. I think the game itself, if you replace the figurines and custom dice with tokens and a small 1-6 result chart, wouldn't cost more than 50$ tax included... and the box would be quite smaller, which would be great too, big boxes are annoying and takes lots of room in one's collection. Big boxes also increase shipping cost, which increase game price.

70$++ (depending on country) for a 2 players game? Who would buy that except a collector of J.R.R. Tolkien's world items?

RATING: 7
After an initial play, this feels like a decently designed tactical scenario using the WotR action dice system. It makes a few peculiar thematic decisions, like a "recruitment" system that doesn't seem to have anything to do with Tolkien's battle, and makes little sense in a three-hour tactical engagement. On the other hand, it does provide a more balanced experience than WotR, with the Free Peoples slowly gaining the ability to launch some interesting counterattacks against an overextended or careless opponent. The game components are high-quality and feel durable. Battles are slower and more fiddly than WotR, such that the estimated play time is quite optimistic.

The number of valid strategies seems somewhat limited by the scripted nature of the game. I suspect that this will be the kind of game that gets "figured out", and then every play feels about the same as all the others. Despite complaints about randomness, I feel like maybe this game needs MORE high-level event randomness to shake up the strategic decisions.

Set in Middle-Earth (yet again) this game offers a thematic recreation of the Battle of the Five Armies which plays out at the end of the Hobbit and leading in the narrative arc of the Lord of the Rings. Now, if you, like me, don't care too much about the theme -- that's OK. Mechanically, we have an asymmetrical and tactical war game that is supplemented by enough cards to make it swingy without being broken. The asymmetry, in short takes the shape of Sauron's armies having the privilege of starting with more armies and having more up their sleeves. The fellowship, however, has a few more tricks (rather than brute force) and their slow but steady trickle of reinforcements really garners speed later in the match -- it's a tense, tactical battle against the clock for both sides. Granted its long, but even if the theme isn't compelling, the gameplay certainly is.

This game is reminiscent of a lightly ameritrashier Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation on an incredibly much larger scale (and with a lot more plastic in hand!). While I've been told that this slightly pales in comparison to its older brother War of the Ring, I found this to be quite the rich experience (with its multiple end-game conditions to really keep players on their toes).

Not for the faint of heart or those who are afraid of probability distributions not fairing in their favour (i.e., there is a lot of dice chucking).

In a word: elegant.  I thoroughly enjoyed the mechanics I already love from War of the Ring implemented in a different way so as to capture the tactical dynamics of the Battle of Five Armies.

Great components, mechanical interactions, and narrative.

Beautiful, tactically complex, strategically interesting despite plunging you directly into the action. TBoFA borrows many mechanics from War of the Ring, but manages to provide a substantially different play experience by eliminating the political track and mustering preparatory rounds and introducing a new level of tactical play with terrain superiority and maneuver cards. I recommend this game unreservedly to anyone who liked WotR, or two player asymmetric wargames with complex tactical play generally.

RATING: 9
I know there is War of the Ring but let's assume this game was first. What else could it score if not 9/10? Powerful and longed heroes with wonderful and thematic abilities at one hand and very tactical and almost hybrid-war battles of very diversified armies topped with extremely thematic event and story cards celebrating most of the original Hobbit story. Action dice give you puzzles to solve each round, lots of wonderful tokens are placed here and there with great splendour and many tactics are tried since there are no winning strategies (only losing ones). The only drawback the game is lacking the original tension between Elves, Men and Dwarves as described in the book. And it's expensive to own.

GREAT game follow-up to WOTR. Using some of the same mechanics but different enough to be it's own game. Bought it on 10/15/15 and like the rule changes from Battles of the 3rd Age concerning removing damage markers. UPDATE: after 20 plays This is my favorite game of the entire series. This game has all the great parts of WOTR & BOTFA combined for a riveting gaming experience. It took a while getting the rules right (thanks Kevin) but after that it's re-playability is unmatched because the AD make you think fast on your feet with every decision being critical.

The Battle of Five Armies is a novel companion to War of the Ring. The design choices made here reflect the brilliance of its predecessor while adding enough new content that the games feel and function quite differently. Battlefield tactics are highlighted to a greater specificity here, as evidenced in the various movement options and unit cards. The maneuver cards add layers of decisions to each combat round, and the damage token system is an innovative approach. However, the cost of these elements is a slower, more cumbersome combat system. While this game stands on its own admirably, I'd rather be playing War of the Ring.

Sibbling of [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/115746/war-ring-second-edition]War of the Ring[/url]. Where the other game shines with narrative and tactics above luck, this game is the opposite. It tries but ultimately fails to tell the tale of the battle of the five armies. It lacks the narrative story the cards from WotR convey. Dice and the drawing of fate tiles dictate the outcome of the game more then tactical choices made by the players. Which would be fine if the game duration stated on the box (60 minutes), wouldn't be a complete and utter lie. This game just offers less; story wise and game wise then it's older and bigger sibbling.

RATING: 9
Played twice; thoroughly enjoyed both times, despite slogging through some tough-to-understand-at-first rules.  Still, lots of fun and engaging.  For me, this plays in 2 to 2.5 hours right now though, much longer than 1 hour (as advertised).  

The components are good, with the minis being the star of the show.  There seem to be some slight issues with the board slightly warping (not only mine, but others have made this comment), and many of the chits were off center on the print, which is only slightly annoying.  Still, materials are high quality.  

My gaming partner seems to think the game may have an imbalance, in favor of the Free People, but it is hard to tell with only two games so far.  

Landing this at 8.5 right now, with room to grow or decline by a half point or so.

UPDATE AFTER 3rd play:  Still great.  Still floating between 8.5 and 9, due to accesibility, setup, and potential imbalance-- all minor complaints at this point.  After 1 more play as the Shadow player, I will gvie it a final rating.

This game recreates the feeling of the conclusion of the hobbit in an extremely thematic way. This game is the first that has dice combat that I actually enjoy because it's mixed with card playing and also potential activation of special abilities. Further mitigated by rerolls for leadership. The fate track is quite interesting as well and requires the evil player to know what might be coming and how to fend it off or prepare for it.

I've still not played War of the Ring, but I'm excited to do so now.

The box's suggested playing time is a vicious lie. Our learning game with 2 players took nearly 6 hours, and there wasn't particularly much that stopped us cold to look through rules, either. Anyway, I can see getting it down to 2 1/2 hours but not much more than that.

Battle of Five Armies is a fun game about the climactic battle of The Hobbit. It manages to create a lot of tension and puts a lot of pressure on both sides. However, in comparison to the War of the Ring it pales for me which is not a fault of the game but simply due to its scope which doesn't let it tell a story as epic as in War of the Ring.

The Battle of Five Armies is a standalone game based on the rules for War of the Ring, which is from the same designers, but with the rules modified to function on a tactical level as they describe a smaller battle rather than the entire war. Ares Games plans to expand the Battles game system in the future, releasing expansions depicting other battles from the Third Age of Middle-earth narrated in The Lord of the Rings, such as the Siege of Gondor and the assault of Saruman against Rohan.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I much prefer War of the Ring but this one is interesting in its own right.  The dice can be quite fickle and frustrating - VERY frustrating.  Similar system to WotR with the dice determining your actions and those are pretty similar to WotR actions.  There are several different win conditions for both sides and the game feels relatively balanced I think at first glance.

There seems to be a lot of depth to this one, and would be really tense between two experienced players. (very much like War of the Ring) Asymmetrical sides with lots of options for both players each turn. Similar clever system as War of the Ring, although combat is a little bit more involved and detailed.

I grew up in the '70s and early '80s, and when I play games like this now, I remember a lot of the uninspiring 'parlour' type or 'family' games that were around and that I played then, and I am always struck by how much better games such as this one are to what I was playing then. My friends and I would have played this one over and over. So enjoy it while it's here now. Not just another Hobbit licensed game, it's a top notch battle game design regardless of the topic.

I haven't had a chance to finish this game, but I understand the mechanics. I must say I don't understand the layers of fiddliness to the combat.

You have to place and move a bunch of tokens with the armies and substitute different colors of dice. I don't see the need for either of these things, as there were simpler solutions that accomplish the same effect.

But it's a cool-looking game with a great theme and lots of potential. My rating reflects this but could change with a complete play.

I definitely want to acquire it.

You could call it a scaled down version of War of the Ring. It uses the same system and plays much quicker. The battle resolution is a lot different though and adds to the overall experience. It won't replace WotR as the go-to LOTR epic game, but it doesn't really need to.

1st play impressions:  I played Sauron's forces and won.  The die-roll based action selection mechanism is very enjoyable.  Even though this means your actions are dictated by random events, it seems to balance out overall & felt like I was commanding an army that wasn't fully under my control.  The simple dice-based combat, however, was infuriating and annoying as always: I really prefer a more deterministic combat.  That said, the damage mechanism was unique, easy and overall GREAT!  If I were to get a LoTR game, I would get War of the Ring over this one.

Depicting the finale of The Hobbit, the titular Battle of Five Armies, this game takes mechanics presented in War of the Ring and refines them a bit, cutting back some of the fat and focusing the game into a battle, making for a faster and smaller game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I'm seriously wondering how different The Battle of Five Armies will be from the scenario expansions in "Battles of the Third Age" which was part of what was included in the only expansion for War of the Ring first edition. I liked those scenarios a lot but I didn't like how you had to mix and match pieces from the regular game that were used in both with ones that were just used in either regular expanded game or scenario game. Felt like it would have been better if it had completely independent components and played as a seperate agme instead of sharing some components and having it so mechanics were similar, but different enough that you couldn't remember which rule applied for each game. That being said, the Gondor and Rohan scenarios included in the expansion for first edition war of the ring were worthy, fun, and a different experience than the main game, expanded or otherwise, but did one feel they were worth playing because of those factors and the fact that they took about as much time as war of the ring proper in addition to the fact that thematically those battles are included in the larger game? not sure, it's a question of taste. I will probably play them at least once or twice a year, but Battle of Five Armies seems like one I would play more because it will be a standalone game and represents a different scenario than what War of the Ring already includes. I hope that it will achieve this.

RATING: 8
Great Tolkien inspired 2-player wargame to fight over control of the Lonely Mountain. Shadow seems harder to play for the inexperienced player but it still feels well balanced between equal experienced players. Very thematic. Some of the side characters don't see play based on the tempo of the game which can be disappointing. Great side game to the big brother War of the Ring. Gives a more small scaled war feel compared to War of the Ring which is a more macro feeling war game. Both fantastic games based on what you are looking for. This one is slightly shorter playtime. 2.5-3 hrs compare to 4-5 with War of the Ring.

Excellent wargame, the asymetric play makes it very interesting and totally different with both sides. The Free People have to stand as long as possible, waiting for reinforcments, strong allies (Thorin, Beorn, Eagles), or turn 15 (automatic victory) ; on the other hand, Bolg has to rush to win as fast as possible, each turn making it harder for him. Lots of events make it sound like the Hobbit story, you feel the epic as the battle rages on. Excellent game !

Based on one play, great fun and calibrates the gameplay elements of "War of the Ring" to the climactic battle of "The Hobbit." I need more time with the game to determine if it is a classic that bears replay the way WOTR does.

You know how a Kiwi director (peter Jackson) jumped the shark and made three movies about not much at all yeah? Well most people think that was an abomination right? Well this game is actually worse than the films. It is just a dressed up version of Risk with a bunch of extra unnecessary fluff tacked on. It reminds me a lot of Conquest of Nerath. Got a bunch of buzz from the Dicetower then fell off the earth. This will do the same thing. Do yourself a favour and stop allowing Vasel's skewed opinions make your purchasing decisions for you.

I don't like it more than WotR and it is not one I will own, I don't think. I would play it again just to see more of the game play. In my game it was ended a bit prematurely since both me (free people) and Joe (shadow) were so new and making a ton of mistakes. I would rather just play the epic game of WotR.

This may move up after more plays but WOW, this takes something I loved (War of the Ring) and zooms it way in for a single battle. I LOVE this game. I played as shadow army and just dove right into attacking the free people. Spent alot of time adding to the gobilns in the mountains and then had them pour out of the mountains causing a big headache for the free peoples player.

Free peoples seem a little tougher to play as far as complexity because they have much more to keep track of with lots of characters and abilities. 

Not sure who has the advantage in this one Im thinking that shadow army has advantage early but the longer the game goes on the more it swings to free people. 

Looking forward to more plays of this.

RATING: 9
14-11-2014. Rated after 2 plays. Highly thematic boardgame implementation of the final battle of the Hobbit. It will inevitably be compared to War of the Ring, from the same designers using many of the same dice mechanisms.

In BoFA, the shadow tries to invade the valley of Dale, in front of the Lonely mountain where the Dwarves just reconquered their ancient home. Both sides play completely different, and win on completely different ways. The heroes win when the Fate track reaches 15, unlocking all kinds of heroes on the way. The shadow player wins when he controls 10 VPs worth of strongholds on the board.

Each turn, the hero player activates a number of generals. For each general the hero player activates, the fate track becomes easier to manipulate for the shadow player, slowing it down buying him/her time. Then, all players roll action dice with specific symbols. Each symbol corresponds to one type of actions you can execute. This means the game constrains you in choices by having you make the best choices available for you.

Combat works quite easy. Each game you play a card from your hand, which can be an event-card from a shared deck or one of your units. You determine how many dice you may roll, and then apply damage. Damage is applied by placing counters, and only when the total amount of damage counters exceeds the amount of units in that area, you remove troops (for each troop, you remove 2 counters).

I really like this game. Unlocking the heroes and all heroes having special abilities makes them feel really an integrated part of the game. This is 'improved' over War of the Ring, where the heroes have less big roles. I really like the change. Also, the scale is different. In War of the Ring, the whole world is the battlefield. This game plays just one battlefield and might be more tactical.

Damage in this game is a little more fiddly than War of the Ring, because of the damage fiches. The system in practice works ok, but it's a little more complicated than every figure just having 1 hitpoint. Also, having the event-cards be playable in battle makes that you are constantly building your hand, sorting cards, which is a bit fiddlier. Regardless, the game is fun and these small things do not detract for me.

RATING: 7
Relative to War of the Ring, this one throws out the Hunt for the Ring and focuses on military struggle, with the Free Peoples again under siege but having more leeway to prepare and counter-attack. Better than expected, with some nice touches like the Generals' activations and unit abilities expressed through maneuver cards. The Fate Track acts as a timer, and is cleverly tied to advancing slower if the FP wants to activate more generals (a 'stealth' mechanic that I like in games) -- would be cooler if the Fate deck had more varied cards though.

I don't like how it's easier to jump 2 spaces if there's an enemy at the destination to attack versus if the enemy isn't there. Gives rise to some weird gamey situations, and seems to conflict in spirit with the other (better) rule that speedbumps can stop enemy armies from fast-moving through. I recognize they wanted to introduce more movement, but wish it felt more logical or was done so with a smaller board.

Fate Track 'nukes' are also dissatisfying with their deus ex machina feel (sort of like the source material). Feel like I'm playing Risk 2210 or Fortress America instead of swords-and-arrows fantasy. In fact, the entire game seems more at home in a sci-fi setting (with recruitment tokens feeling like alien eggs/larvae, which you can set fire to when taking over the nest!).

No decision to be made at all with your first few Eye dice, which makes it a little weird, almost like a 'leftovers' thing (need something to abstract goblins... oh hey look, something to repurpose the Eye for).

Think I'll pass on acquiring this and wait for Rohan/Gondor/War in the North.

Yet another great Middle Earth interactive narration from Nepitello, Maggi and Di Meglio. Different enough from War of the Ring to provide one with a fresh story and challenge (though entirely derivative from the, underrated, Battles of the Third Age). 

A few very minor remarks: components are over the top but the recycled orcs arbalesters from BoTA don't look at all like goblins to me. Also, and this might just be the way I played the evil player, while the game does a good job in conveying the chaotic ebbs and flows of the battle, the amount of figures and the pulsed movements tend to populate the battlefield rather sparsely, not as in the intense, epic fray I've always imagined this battle to be. Finally, the action dice play a really major role in this one, as there is less scope to manipulate them than in WoTR. Here, with some bad luck, situations might arise with no possible action to be taken with a certain die. Still a great compact version of the parent game, no question about that.

[i]Super Fun Skirmish Scenario with Possibly Limited Strategic Scope[/i]

First impressions:

* Not as good as War of the Ring. Start there if you've never played either; despite this being shorter I feel like it will be more satisfying to people already familiar with WAr of the Ring because it is more fiddly and less impressive

* I like that the characters and unit types are much more differentiated than in War of the Ring

* Extra fiddliness in combat to determine who has advantaged terrain bonus, and which cards get to come to your hand each battle means this game might not even be as good as War of the Ring for "beginners." But I'm sure this gets better with experience (once you have all of the units and terrains memorized)

* Game seems more linear than War of the Ring, so I wonder how the long term depth holds up.

Rating may go down depending on what I find from strategic progression. Fairly concerned over how much more linear the game seems than War of the Ring and how important it seems for Shadow to play a certain way. But we'll see.

I've long maintained that I'm not a war gamer.  Mostly it is the theme that puts me off.  I'm not a history buff and most war games try to deliver the experience of some real life historical battle to the player.  There's a demographic for that, I just don't belong to it.  I am a big fan of fantasy themes though and for that reason I've always had my eye on War of the Ring.  I just never pulled the trigger because theme isn't the only reason I don't really play war games.  I also rarely play two player-only games and strategic troop command isn't my forte.  Then came this game, the Hobbit is my favorite book in the Tolkien/Middle-Earth setting and the Battle of Five Armies is my favorite part of that book.  Let's give it a shot.

Again, I'm not a war gamer, but past describing this as a war game I would call this area control and maybe that is a big part of what makes a war game.  One player takes on the role of the free peoples and the other the shadow armies.  The victory conditions are a bit more detailed than this but essentially the free peoples are much more focused on defending areas of the board while the shadow armies' play style is more about aggression and conquering as many of the free peoples' cities as quickly as possible.  With an emphasis on quickly, there is a timer mechanic in this game that prevents the shadow armies from bolstering up their forces too much before attacking.  The longer the game lasts the more powerful the free peoples get and if it lasts too long the free peoples outright win.  Not only does this step up the time table for aggression from the shadow peoples but they have a hard time reasserting themselves if an attack they spent a lot of resources on is defended.

At first the way battles, in the end, devolved into die rolls frustrated me.  I've always been an unlucky die roller and I was afraid this would be a 2-hour game of the luckiest player wins.  However the card play really supplements this in a way that makes it interesting and if I really think on it I wouldn't want battles to be completely deterministic either.  Also, the special units are a ton of fun to play with (they remind me of creatures in Kemet).  I played the shadow armies and they only get one special unit which was disappointing since they were the most interesting part of the game but still, it added a lot of flavor and variance to game play.

I really enjoyed this.  I still don't think I have the skills to be very good at it and I still rarely play two-player only games, especially ones this long (BGG says 90 minutes but I think that should be closer to 2+ hours and doesn't take into account set up and tear down time so you're really looking at 3 hours of your life beginning to end), but I would enjoy it when/if I could get it played.  I also do worry, and this is something else that typically turns me off to war games, that the same static set up would get old as players learn the best strategies for each side.  The card play can vary this a little but really in the end if there is a better strategy for each side many plays would have this come out and make future games stale.  But I guess when it got to that point it would be time to trade this away.

If you don't have War of the Ring buy that instead.  If you do have War of the Ring and love it, then you should buy this because while it is not as good, it is still very good.  Because it is a single battle it will not have as much replayability as War of the Ring, so I suppose that it is better in a collection of over 25 games, but very good and something that I would play from time to time, even though it has to compete with WotR.

BoFA seems very much to be in the mould of; thrown enough stuff in and people will a) like it because of how complex it is and b) if it's broken, it doesn't matter because everyone will have bought it by then anyway.

I don't actually know that it is broken, but how could you possibly balance that many moving parts? There is almost certainly a major issue there somewhere.

Despite those quibbles, and the messy design of dice choosing actions, but each action being three or four different things, I quite enjoyed BoFA. I can't see it being something I'll play frequently, but it was an interesting game in the Stronghold/Seven Sword vein.

Initial impressions are very good. It's all of the things I liked about War of the Ring, but they've removed the needlessly complicated search for the ring aspect and made a few other improvements. I like the combat and the story cards here a lot better too. The cards in WotR seemed very specific and took a lot of time to utilize, but the cards here are more universal and overall more useful. The faster play time is also a big plus.

Update: I still like the game, but I rarely play two-player games anymore, especially ones that are this long and complex.

RATING: 7

[thing=135219][/thing] is a medium-heavy (for my standards) wargame set in the land of Middle-Earth. Shocking, right? I will do a short breakdown of things that might be important about the game.

[b]Theme[/b]
Is strong in this one. There are many thematic decisions throughout the game, and makes it much richer. The Eagles take a while to appear. The Giant Bats fly around and are a nightmare to the Free People. Units have places were they battle better. Every type of unit has unique cards that can have effects in battle in which they participate. Strongholds resist damage to a point. Thorin, if the enters battle in the field, destroys the Front Gate. The Shadow army is mostly a big rabble, without strong leadership (no Nazgûl here) until Bolg appears. The Free People armies have less units, but have way more in terms of leadership (with Gandalf, Thranduil, Dáin, Bard and Thorin). Very neat, clever and works pretty well, without clogging the mechanics.

The only somewhat not very thematic decision is to give an important role to Bilbo in the battle. Sure, Bilbo is awesome, we all know this. But in the Battle of Five Armies he did basically nothing, except being invisible for a while then knocked out senseless.

[b]Balance of power[/b]
In [thing=115746][/thing] the momentum of war is all in the Shadow side. The Shadow is up for war from the get-go, and its allies (willing or not) are also close to open battle from the start. The Free People, except, Gondor, are way behind in this matter. So, basically, the Free People have a difficult time to muster forces and make places stronger, even when knowing battle is few turns away. The FP player just have to hope for the best. Also, the forces of the Free People are few and dwindling: every hit taken is felt, since is a unit that won't ever come back. The Free People player knows it won't resist for too much time.

Well, if all of this made you feel sad and sorrowful for the Free People, you should play [thing=135219][/thing]. Because in here the Free People can kick some serious Shadow ass. It is still somewhat harder for the FP to put units in the board, but things are more balance even in this point. Units aren't gone forever. Also, the FP have more leadership, can attack with bows and some magical blasts that Gandalf can do.

Sure, you will hate those damn Bats, but once the Eagles enter the game, they will rip through the forces of the Shadow like a warm knife through butter. Beorn will do no less than this - and the size of his miniature besides the others shows that he mean business.

For instance, in the game, after I lost the Camp and a Shadow army was beaten down the Front Gate, I sent Gandalf with an elf army to battle against the enemy attacking the Front Gate, and killed everyone there. Then, a force, lead by Dáin, came to attack and took the Camp back. Yes, the Ruins of Dale were taken from the FP in this time, and the Eastern Spur was surrounded by two Shadow armies. But I knew that, if I mustered and prepared, I could sent forces to try to give some breathing room for the defenders of the Eastern Spur or attack the Ruins of Dale with my Eagles.

All I mean is this: the Free People are, mostly, toe to toe with the Shadow in mighty of arms, even in quantity.

[b]Timing[/b]
Which means that the Shadow, in order to win, must attack and it is them that have to battle against time. Again, in WotR, both sides have to rush sometimes, but I always felt that, with the FP, I had to, usually, basically run to my goal, otherwise I would lose. Time lets the Shadow grow stronger, since this side has more dice to use, so more actions to move, build up and take some nasty cards.

In [thing=135219][/thing] time is totally in the FP side. Two triggers for the FP win depend upon time: when Beorn enters the game, the Shadow has to have at least 6 points. If the token reaches the 15th space in the track without the Shadow fulfilling its goal, the FP also win. The third trigger for the FP win is killing Bolg. The Shadow only wins if they have conquered 10 points at any point at the end of a round after the token passed the 10th space, but before it reaching the 15th space.

By the way, speaking of time, [thing=135219][/thing] is an affair that will take around 150+ minutes of real world time. I thought it would be less (and can, since one or other trigger can end the game sooner), but is basically the same amount of time my plays of WotR took.

[b]Battle[/b]
This is the main focus of the game. [thing=135219][/thing] is a wargame, no error in this. Movements of units, recruitment, preparation and battles made up almost the whole game.

Beign more important in here, the fight is more fleshed out: the type of unit matters much more, since some can make ranged attacks, and, more relevant, is that some units fight better in some terrains. Each type of unit has an unique card that can be used as a card in battle (the same as using an card for the battle effect) and the player than rolls the black die for each unit of the type that matches the card - if a hit is given in these black die, the effect on the card takes place - and there are some nasty ones.

Also, the army with the most units adapted to the terrain will have an advantage (buying a card); and if your units are battling from the higher terrain, you gain the momentum.

Finally, the battle is longer. There isn't anymore the need to have elit units to keep fighting in an attack - now the battle goes for as long as the sides want to (since, if possible, one side, after every round of battle, can choose to retreat or disband). So a side that has an advantage can keep pressing on. To balance this, the hits now give damage, instead of outright eliminating. Units can sustain damage up until the number of them, and then, if the damage surpasses the number of units, the player must remove one unit to "heal" two damage, until the amount damage is equal or less the number of units (say, for example, a three unit army receives five damage after an attack, the player then takes one unit out, lowering the amount of damage to three, which is still higher than the two units left, so he must take out another, lowering the damage to one, which is equal to the number of units, so he stops). This allows for some nice moments and opportunities, and is used a lot in the game (not only by several effects, but one of the actions that can be made with the muster die is to heal damage).

Overall the battles work pretty well, and there plenty of them throughout the game.

[b]Production[/b]
It is very good. Nice art, minis, components. Nothing is really lacking in this department. You sure get nice bits for your money.

[b]Difficulty[/b]
I found [thing=135219][/thing] to be easier than WotR. The scope is smaller, and decisions don't have to be made with so many things in mind. But there are still plenty to make you think.

The actions through the dice are basically the same one used in WotR. Character die lets you move an army with a character or leadership; or to put one character in play. Muster flips unit tokens. They Eye is different, since now it works mostly to put goblins in play - the search for the Ring of power hasn't really begun yet.

The card play is also basically the same, the difference being that the the FP and the Shadow have one deck each that only is used for events. Shadow and FP share a common deck, and this one is the same: the top part for events, and bottom part to be used as a battle effect.

The Free People player have a little more work to do, as she must control/activate the FP generals (Bard, Dáin, Thranduil, Gandalf, Thorin) and two allies (Eagles and Beorn), each of them with an unique effect in the game. The Shadow mostly concern herself with movement of troops, as the only unique character this side has is Bolg.

[b]The Epicness[/b]
Though the [thing=135219][/thing] is a major and very important battle, is still only a battle. The scope of War of the Ring is much greater and everything seems to put the fate of Middle-Earth in check. There is a broader effect to see most of Middle-Earth, and witness the greatest of strongholds of the Free People threatened, and taken. To see Rohan coming to aid Minas Tirith, or even Erebor trying to fend off the easterlings. Yes, the armies in [thing=135219][/thing] can be as big (per miniatures, as units in WotR represent way more individuals), but the stakes aren't as dire. One person of the Free People can say "Eh, we lost this battle, but still we can win the war". WotR is the war he would be talking about.

[b]Final evaluation:[/b]
[thing=135219][/thing] is a great game, not completely unlike [thing=115746][/thing] (which is a good thing, since learning the rules becomes way easier) in mechanics, but one that differs a lot in feel and scope. Surely recommended, however I wish the playing time wasn't so close to WotR, to open up more opportunities to play and also didn't actually compete for the same slots of time - and I just can't see a way around this, since most balance plays will indeed last close or more than 3 hours.

Played a learning game with a friend - 

First impressions:
Good bits, like the various actions for each die face

The game rules were not as clear as they could be and the card deck names take getting used to - kinda fiddly in that regard....

I should have a good handle on the game after I reread the rules and watch a video or two

If the game can be a quick 60 minute or so punch-fest I think I will be happy with it - based on that the rating will go up or down

Standalone battle in the valley ominously overshadowed by Lonely Mountain.  The game uses the same engine from War of the Ring with added tactics for detailed combat. A fate track is added to effect the flow of time as the free people fight to outlast the onslaught of Borg's forces. Dice driven game determines available actions and combat system has an interesting casualty mechanic using damage tokens.

This game, although not as epic as WotR is still such a fun, tense game. I wish it was a 2 hour game and then it would really have been a contest as to which is the better game. However, because the playing time is so close to WotR. WotR still retains the title as the better game for general strategic gameplay. Still, a very fun game, if you can find people willing to invest the time to play.

RATING: 8
Much different from its older cousin, WotR, BoFA brings (in my view) a whole different feel to the table.  BoFA is much more a wargamey substance than its cousin.  Here, there is little metagame (ie, the Ring game), it's just a straight slugfest.  But, like its older cousin it provides you with lots of difficult choices, and the tension mounts as the game goes on, mainly due to the fate track (the sort of mini-meta game that goes on).  All in all, there is an awful lot going on in this little package.  Time will tell if it falls into a pattern of sameyness in the way it unfolds.  I'd be highly surprised if it did, it seems there are a surprising number of ways to victory here.  I'm a little biased, partly for being such a Tolkien geek, but mostly because this game falls in a very sweet spot for me.  Namely, strict limits on what you can do each turn, and a timing mechanism which sets a variable game length that really ramps up the tension.  If you like those types of things, this is most definitely for you.

________________________________________________________
EDIT:
I never ever thought I would do this, but my rating for a Tolkien game is going down.  I think Bo5A is a great game, but it really has some serious swingy random elements that do not plague War of the Ring.  The game does seem a bit samey and unfolds the same way, BUT... I have seen wildly different results with the exact same strategy.  That is not usually a good sign.  Fate track timer has a bit too much influence on the game.  That wouldn't be bad if it wasn't for the fact that the Shadow can never hope to win when the fate track accelerates rapidly (after Beorn and the Eagles come in, especially.)  And The Free seems to be losing if the fate track stalls.

RATING: 8
Since War of the Ring is my all time favorite game, expectations were very high for this.  My early impression is that this game misses some of the epic feel of WotR.  The board is a bit bland and the unnamed regions are a bit boring.  It is nice that each type of unit brings some special abilities to combat.  Trying to decide between mixed armies (more maneuver cards, but less chance to trigger) and focused armies (smaller hands, but a greater chance of triggering) is interesting.  Trying to decide how many generals to activate also makes it interesting.  Like WotR, the Free People are at a numerical disadvantage.  Adding more characters as fate advances help increase the tension in the late game, however, if fate is crawling, it is hard for the Free People to withstand the Shadow onslaught.  A little concerned about replayability because the armies seem to move fairly similar in each game.

Decent game. The narrative is not as strong here as it is in War of the Ring or Age of Conan while also feeling more scripted. Scale also seems a bit off. Another beautiful production.

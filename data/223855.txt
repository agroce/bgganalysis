I like arithmetic puzzles way more than most people, but they don't make a good game in this case. 
Two key problems:
-The game is operating on three different axis that aren't really strategically connected and getting them all to work out seems very luck based.
-The options change right before your turn starts, sometimes drastically, so there's no point in planning ahead. That means that there is a lot of downtime as one person is doing math in their head while everyone else is sitting around doing nothing. Not fun.

Sentient is a card (puzzle) game based on simple math. It is a satisfying kind of puzzle. There is also some auction and area-control which makes it harder to choose which card to take: the card that fits perfect with your dice, the card that fits in your set collection, or the card that allows you majority in an area. The game looks beautiful. The theme is neat but hides that it is an abstract game. The feel of the game changes a depending on the player count: 2 player is much more strategic while 4 player is more unpredictable. My only complaint is the price, which feels a bit too expensive for this kind of game.

It's...fine? The dice are the nicest thing about it but you dont do much with them aside from roll them three times and maybe turn them a couple times. The cards only have 5 different pieces of art, and the player boards are extraneous and overlarge. It's something that barely qualifies as a game, more like a tactical puzzle, and even though there is some area control fighting there is still very little interaction. I'd play it again, but probably not with 4 where it dragged. still, nothing special. zero theme integration, literally zero, as much as it might want to have theme.

RATING: 6
Roll five dice and place them on your player board.  Draft cards to sit between pairs of dice.  Those cards modify the value of the dice and have a requirement, such as the sum of the two dice must be an even number.  You will have gathered that this is quite a puzzley game.  To this Sentient adds an auction for end game point multipliers which brings some welcome interaction.  This game is certainly different, but maths puzzles aren't my idea of fun.

The artwork is OK and production quality is good.

Art direction was very good and the simple gameplay mechanics were enjoyable.  Despite it's simplicity, there was some jockey-ing for the various cards along with the upgrades to the corporations.  We played 4, but imagine it would be much better at a lower count, probably 3 being the best.

RATING: 7.5
This is a tough game to evaluate in some ways.  Components are top notch.  Instructions well written.  Mechanics are solid.  The only catch to the game is both its appeal and its detractor... namely, control.   It's a very tactical game that demands players to make the most of the current situation.  There is not always a lot a player to can to alter the fates though and that creates the problem for some players.  With repeat plays, players have a better idea of how to play to minimize and/or plan for the luck factor, but initial plays will have some harsh swings that may detract from an otherwise very mechanically solid game.  I could image an expansion down the line (in the form of new investors and/or cards) that can be saved for end-game or burned mid game to add additional options.  I would suspect that the additions that allow such strategic options would be very well received.  The game has plenty of chances to see really meaningful expansions.  Its a well done game that deserves several plays at the least.

The more I play this game, the more I love it.  It's puzzle-based and can be challenging, almost like a mathematical crossword puzzle.  Getting all the cards to work together when they are "plugged in" and scored is such a rewarding feeling.  At first the game feels abstract with a pretty paint job but as you take a closer look at the different types of industries, bots, etc., you really get a feel for the deeper themes and how it all works together.  Outstanding components too.

Challenging and frustrating, not necessarily in a bad way. There is a lot of input randomness in what you roll and what cards come out, but there are a lot of ways to mitigate the luck. You often find none of your choices are good, so it up to you to figure out what will be the "least bad" decision. I'm not crazy about the tie-breaking rule (where one player always gets to break all ties for the round), but I found the game intriguing. Rating is likely to go up or down depending on whether frustration elbows out fun in future plays.

Multiplayer. Set collecting, card drafting, area influence.

Pros: 
Play relatively fast
Simple to explain
Harder to master
Puzzly and challenging
Looks great
Love the custom dice. Great look/quality.

Cons: 
Pasted-on theme
All the art are the same for each card category (though, it probably helps with the price.




Note: 
The theme says you're programing the technologies in your civilisation, but it's more of a mathematical/puzzly challenge then actual programming. The design is what first caught my attention, the gameplay is what made me buy it. Beautiful and fun to play. Plus, I love feeling the proudness of a good move.

Puzzle game set in a sci-fi environment. Players are supposed to be programming robots for military, transport, industry, service and information purposes. However, at no time you really get that feeling. It is a nice puzzle game though.
Over 3 rounds players throw 5 dice which are placed on their player boards. Then they have to choose a card which belongs to one of the 5 fields and which contains a scoring condition, next to a dice manipulation. This card has to be placed in between 2 dice. The value of these dice has to be adjusted according to the left and right top corner die manipulation on the card (+1, -1 or =). The scoring condition on the card depends on the values of the dice (e.g. the sum is smaller than 4 or larger than 10; or the left die value is smaller than the right one). Each round 4 cards have to be placed in between the dice. Of course 3 dice will be manipulated twice, only the leftmost and the rightmost dice are manipulated once. It is possible to ignore the die manipulation by placing an assistant in the left or right top corner of the card, but this implies that these assistants can no longer be used on the card market.
The card market contains 5 shields, representing the 5 fields of activity. The 4 cards in the market are placed in between these shields (each card has a shield to its top left and another to its top right). Each time a card is taken, a player has to place a worker in between the shields above this card. He can opt to add one or more assistants to his worker. Why would he want to do this ? Well, at the end of the round the player with most workers and assistants next to a shield gets this shield. And at the end of the game the number of shields of each field of activity are multiplied with the number of cards of the same activity to add points to the points that were gained on the basis of the card/dice combinations during the game.

There is more pink and purple in this box than perhaps any other game.  The custom dice are quite lovely, as is the entire production and presentation.   Unfortunately, this game is WAY, WAY overpriced at $55 MSRP.  That's crazy.   On the positive side, it is a very solid dice puzzle game.   I like the way that you are forced to compete in area majority for suit tokens while drafting cards from the central display.  That interlocking mechanism, while very simple, makes from some juicy choices as you try to resolve if your dice will work (or can be made to work) with your cards.   A well-designed and well-executed product.

RATING: 7
Sentient had me at 'dice manipulation,' but surprisingly won me over with 'area majority.' Since the game offers two equally effective scoring methods, and utilizes a dual-use resource, each decision in the game is three-fold. Players must balance card acquisition, dice modification, and area majority throughout the entire game. A specific card might score you a lot of points now, but is attached to a mostly useless end game tile, or perhaps a card could help secure you an end game tile, but is attached to counterproductive dice modifiers. These delicious decisions are sprinkled throughout every facet on Sentient, and even though it offers up the same puzzle each game, the decisions remain interesting.

This game lives in a strange niche -- a bit too mathy for casual gamers, and too light for heavy gamers. But I enjoyed trying to puzzle out optimal moves where I would get majorities I needed at the same time I was taking cards I could work with, and was then able to place those cards in places that would score them. Beautiful art and custom dice, but not worth the high MSRP.

[b]The theme[/b]: The theme of [thing=223855][/thing] looks amazing - future, world filled with robots and you are one of their programmers. But frankly, it could have been anything. The theme is not connected to mechanics at all, it's just in the artwork. But, for some reason, I don't really mind.

[b]The visuals[/b]: The components of [thing=223855][/thing] are amazing. The artwork on the cards is breathtaking, the different types of robots are easily recognizable, the custom dice are beautiful and perfectly functional and there are custom meeples and "assistants". The cards are of good cardstock (and very big), the dice are chunky and easy
to manipulate. The only beef I have with the visuals is that the symbols on the cards are not readable from both sides of the table (and there is a room for that, so I don't understand why).

[b]The gameplay[/b]: [thing=223855][/thing] connects light area control with card drafting and dice mannipulation. Those 3 mechanics don't look like they could be mixed together, but it works surprisingly well. The game goes for exactly 3 rounds, during which you draft 4 cards from the middle of the table that you need to place between 2 of your dice (the card can change their sides) and if those dice meet the condition of the card, you gain points at the end of the round. Plus, it depends from where you took the card and how much power you used on that, as you could score significant bonus points at the end of the game, if you control the appropriate bonus tiles. 

[b]The fun[/b]: Without the area control part, there would be no interaction between the players. But, thankfully, there is :) The games goes by pretty quickly so you don't have time to get bored :D If you enjoy solving your own puzzle, it is a great game. Plus, there is almost no strategy, just tactics. If you don't like that, well, you won't like the game.

Sentient doesn't do anything mind blowing and yet I found it to be good fun. Players draft robit cards from a tableau, add it to their player board where the robits may or may not manipulate the dice they are adjacent too (preferably so the robit can be fully activated to generate VP, and then add an agent (and possibly assistants) above the card's spot in the tableau in hopes of having majority for 1-2 of the contracts, which act as game end multipliers. 

Some might level the charge that it is "Math, the Game", which is fair because there are a lot of quiet moments where you're trying to figure out if their dice's values will work with a robit's requirements. This also means that player interaction is quite low, which is typically a non-starter for me. But the game is snappy and satisfying enough to warrant a 7. Happy to play any time for the time being.

RATING: 8
Just a familiar comfortable puzzle that doesn't over stay it's welcome. You can interact with other players by taking their cards or resetting the "market" but there is enough redundancy that this will never completely ruin any one's plan. So you get the good parts of player interaction (incremental advantage and it always *feels important) without losing how you're keyed into the puzzle.

I don't know what it is about Alex Kevern's designs. They are functional, they are light, they are great for families, but they all leave me wanting more. I like this one a bit less than World's Fair 1893 (haven't tried Gold West yet), but neither game is something I am itching to play. I keep World's Fair in my collection because I like the theme better and because I can introduce it to anyone, but they are both fairly unsatisfying experiences. This one has a lot of randomness in how the cards come out, but the area control aspect is done a bit better than in World's Fair, I guess, but that's faint praise. There is only so much dice manipulation you can do here and it's very easy to get screwed out of points simply by how cards come off the deck.

If you can get past the plasticy pink artwork there's a pretty interesting game in here. Every action you take has multiple repercussions, which is quite clever design. For example, your choice of card is dependent on how well it will score, how it will affect the dice that in turn affect other cards, and the future value of the card, which is determined by stocks that you get from a majorities auction that you are bidding on simultaneously as you draft your desired card. There's a lot of subtlety given how streamlined the game is. The more I think about it the more I'm impressed with this design. Looking forward to more play... and possibly adding it to my collection.

Sentient resonates strongly with my gaming tastes.  I love the puzzle-y math with the interaction between cards and dice. I love the interplay with collecting investor tokens and set collection of cards, needing both to effectively activate end game scoring. The short-term scoring and end-game scoring are nicely balanced.  I like the way area control (a mechanic I usually dislike) is integrated with selecting bot cards and acquiring investor tokens. Reasonably quick play time, under an hour even with 4 players. The beautiful art, theme and components are the sweet, sweet icing.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2017)

As is usual from me, I bought Sentient without knowing anything about it. The art of the cover box is amazing so I thought the game was going to be a futuristic endeavor. The theme is indeed futuristic, but the game was a letdown.

Sentient´ s rules are easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes. Playtime is around 50 minutes with 4 players.

The art is very good and the components are nice as well. The dice look great. The game occupies more space than you would think for a card game.

The theme is cool, but you don’t feel it through the game, it is, sadly, pasted on. It could very well be an abstract game.
 
The game´s decisions aren’t very complex. You have only 4 places to play each turn and the decision where to play isn’t hard to process, but you do need to think a bit about it. Not only you are taking the cards to your board, you are also fighting for majority in that area to influence investors. Deciding which card to take each round was easy, deciding how many assistants to play wasn’t as easy (and my favorite decision). When you take a card, they affect the dice you already had on your board. In theory, it sound great, in practice it doesn’t work for me.

The luck factor is very high and uncontrollable. In our game, many times a player took a card and then a great card appeared for the next player. I heavily dislike this part of the game, I feel luck decides who wins as the strategy is very light (it is mostly tactics). The best strategy seems to be leaving a side of your board for the fourth card, that way, it will affect only one important die and you can cancel its effect if you need to with only one assistant. 

The downtime can be high because the game situation changes every turn. There is no point in planning ahead, so you think only during your turn. 

Bottom line, Sentient was a disappointment. I was expecting something else due to its excellent box art (I know this doesn’t make much sense :D). The game is pretty light with (mostly) easy decisions and the luck factor is very high. Planning room is very small and it comes mainly from the majorities (investors). I already sold it. My desire to play it again is low. Perhaps it can be used to teach basic math to kids.

Each game consists of 3 rounds, with a scoring after each round and game-end scoring of a different nature. Every round players roll 5 different colored dice and set them up according to colors on their board. Players send agents and possibly assistants to draft industry cards to place between the dice. At the end of a round, cards are possibly scored if the dice on both sides match the scoring requirement on the card. The card scoring is always related to an equation on the card and whether or not the adjacent dice satisfy the equation. When you place a card, the corners indicate whether the dice on either side change their values (+, -, or =). Because one die is often being used to satisfy the requirement on two cards, placing cards can get tricky. You can use one of your assistants (you have 5 each round) to cover up a modifier and turn it off. However, when you draft a card, you are also creating majority competitions for the industry tiles you will use to score points at the end of the game. Whether you use your assistants to help score cards or to gain tiles is a key decision throughout the game. At the end of each round you score the cards whose requirements are met and create a personal discard pile, clearing the space for the next round. Then, agents and assistants on either side of each industry tile are evaluated and tiles assigned to majority owners.

At game's end you multiply the tiles from each industry that you've acquired with the cards of that same industry that you've also drafted. High score wins. The math can be tricky and you won't like this if you don't like running through variable set results in your head. However, if you are a fan of mathy puzzles - and I like them well enough - there's a lot to like here.

Sentient gains the title 'Most misleading artwork 2017'. Glancing over it in the preparations for Spiel 2017, I quickly ticked it off as another fantasy/SF mishmash: cards, dice, cyborg artwork - all this done in purply-pink.

The greater the surprise when Sentient turned out to be a game of manipulating dice to correctly solve mathematical calculations while winning majority battles. Dry, tactical, enjoyable. Although people who were attracted by the artwork and the theme might judge this to the contrary.

The production is opulent for what basically is a simple game. While it increases the joy of playing, the resulting price is too high given the limited scope of depth, variability.

Generic looking and sentiently themeless, but a very bright old-fashioned game. Thankfully the focus isn't so much on the dice. The dice manipulation is merely a supporting mechanism together with set collection for an intriguing area majority construction. Area majority scheme consists of four plays of which one is a pass action and to make matters more interesting you have a possibility to boost your placements, which brings us to an interesting little resource management choice as these boostings hinder your abilities on the dice manipulation side of the game.

Easy to explain, quick set up, great production and artwork. I really admire J. Alex Kevern's ability to design quick playing, yet delightfully meaty little eurogames. This has very little going on in terms of the main game mechanism, and in theory the card selection and programming element is a bit solitaire-ish and evident at face value - the game comes to life through the area control mini-game where you are jostling for position, trying to align your investors with your card types and making it all work out. Phenomenal design.

Didn't initially think much of trying this one and then it got pulled out at GLG 15 and I was curious so I sat down to play and was quite intrigued by the puzzle involving cards and dice as well the interwoven majority scorings for end game scoring multiplayer. There is both tactical and strategic considerations every turn in order to improve your end game scoring which is a product of type of card taken and the same type of area majority tile won.

Played a game of this at GenCon and even though the game looks fantastic it doesn't really play all that great. The mechanics work, but there isn't much of anything there. Make a few choices, manipulate a few dice, rinse, lather, repeat. Overall I would say this was probably my biggest disappointment of the con.

I enjoyed the puzzle of this game, as the cards manipulate the dice on your player board, which you do have control over to some extent. Definitely a good mix of focusing on both in-game and end-game points. Can't ignore the set collection scoring for the end, in terms of which cards/colors you collect as the game progresses, and which patrons/colors you get for majorities at the end of each round.

Simple game about the same weight as Splendor.  You place agents and other workers down to claim a card.  These cards rotate dice and the card activates for points if you meet the condition.  The cards score for you at the end of the turn.  You also claim these chevrons that function like "stock" and you multiply the type of cards you have claimed by the number of chevrons claimed of the same type at the end of the game.  

It was very fun but I do wonder about replay-ability.  The art is really good but repetitive.  I would not by the game but I liked it.

Long down time with 4 players. Planning ahead is useless because cards to choose from can completely change before it's your turn.
Game is not bad but don't look for depth. It's a mathematical puzzle. Takes a bit to long for what it is (actually a simple game).
Definitely overpriced even though the material looks good.

Difficult game to rate. On one hand, I like the method of drafting cards and building a point scoring engine. It is done much better here than with Elysium, in my opinion. On the other hand, the dice manipulation and card placement make this more of a brain-burner than it feels like it should be. Almost as if the puzzle aspect was tacked on to keep this game from feeling too light. It's fine, but ultimately another mediocre title from Renegade.

RATING: 6
MATH PUZZLE! I love puzzles, and this is all about connecting five dice with mathematical operators that, if true, give you game points. There's an additional layer of game point count in which you try to match the 'suit' of your robot with the subsection of the cybernetics industry in which your investors are most interested.

...Cybernetics industry? Investors? Well, ok, the theme isn't fully integrated with the play mechanisms in that second part, since there's this weird worker placement thing going on at a disjunct with the functions of your actual robots, and in fact you could retheme this puzzle with anything that has five categories and a "STEM" type objective. But whatever. Operations and numbers and robots, cool, those are coherent, and one does have to think about who funds the research, I guess. LET ME REITERATE: MATH PUZZLE! and awesome "chipboard" look to the dice.

That said: I. Hate. Limited. Rounds. And. Turn. Order. That was my biggest beef with Five Tribes, another wonderful abstract/logic/math puzzle game, and it's my second biggest with this, because it's not as time-consuming to set up turn order in Sentient, but it's still a detractor from the actual puzzle, as is the fact that there's not enough play when you only get so many rounds.

Biggest problem? Same as my second biggest with Five Tribes: There are too many ways to score points, requiring too much time to compute, and not enough ways to develop a strategy.

Biggest personal problem: One of the five main art images, which involves improbable bra cup size. Look, if you want to make the theme 'robots', that's fine, but don't sexualize them. This is a puzzle game. I want to use it to teach kids how to read basic operators like 'greater than' and how to evaluate options to work out combinations of game points. I also want them to think of the word 'sentient' as pertaining to decision-making, not boobs, nor do I want them equating boobs and 'Service'.

Would I do the mathy bits again? You betcha. I don't mind the Blade-Runner-World look either, minus the aforementioned feminization issue. But I'd make up a slew of house rules to increase actual *play* time and to minimize *point-counting* and *setup* time, and I'd probably mostly want to do two-player, since that's the player count at which strategy development seems most possible.

Lacks theme completely, but it's a challenging puzzle in a good amount of playing time. Special powers would have been a nice addition, considering player are assuming the role of companies, but there are not such special powers or differentiation between players whatsoever.

Like the puzzly nature of this little game and its timeframe. Tough choices to make, a few gambles and more variables to consider as your understanding of the game deepens (e.g. accepting to sacrifice a scoring card in order to get more investor tokens). However, the artwork is not quite original (all cards feel the same), the display row setup is fiddly (a small board would have been appreciated to keep everything into place), there are no real ways to mitigate the luck of the draft, and this game begs for variable player powers for the left-side player cardboard. Examples of such player powers could have been:
- Once per round, you may use a single Assistant to cancel both signs on a card.
- You may always use 2 Assistants to perform a calibration twice.
- You may always use 2 Assistants to switch a sign to its opposite.
- Once per round, you may discard and replace 2 cards in the display row before choosing.
- Once per round, you may replace a card in your tableau. If you do so, remove 1 Agent over the selected card (or 1 Assistant if no Agent is available).

Easy to teach but heavy enough that it is not for kids. You roll your dice once and after that you draft cards to influence your dice nd score points. Place your "workers" tactically to influence the dice result or place them above the board to win extra ways to earn points. 
Nice art and a beefy game despite the size. The biggest downside is the price of the game. Feels more like a 35 euro game instead of 55

OMG, was this was a surprise hit! I absolutely love this game. The designer is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I love his other games I own (world's Fair & Gold West).

Once again, he proves that you can design a clever, fun game with interesting choices that play in a reasonable amount of time with intuitive rules. These are my favorite types of games.

At it's core, this is a dice manipulation game, by way of drafting cards through worker placement, all to score points via set-collection.

As some have complained, it is quite mathy.  But I find the level of mathiness in this game to be fun and compelling.  Managing the flanking dice to produce the most possible points is an enjoyable challenge in itself, but the decision as to when to use your assistants and whether to use them to bid on the investor tokens or to use them to prevent the forced die "recalibrations" are just as important, if not more so.  Solid game, but replayability may be an issue.

UPDATE:  There is a major jump in the replayability once you realize how much of the game is in how you deploy your assistants (bidding or mitigating die recalibrations).  Maxing out the card points each round becomes fairly routine and tactical and there is not much differentiation in round scoring from those cards.  But there is humongous room in how well you deploy those 5 assistants from round to round and that is where the interaction and tension comes from.  The game is so much better when you realize this.

This is a nifty game that doesn't fall neatly into familiar categories. It has card drafting, area control, and set collection, but the core mechanism is a multi-part arithmetic puzzle. Cards both let you nudge numbers around and set conditions that you want them to meet. The fact that dice are used to track the numbers is an implementation fact rather than anything essential.

Was unsure about buying this at first as it seemed a little over-priced but bit the bullet and have no regrets. It's terrifically produced, especially the fantastic dice, but the real prize is the excellent gameplay. Each turn presents an interesting and often challenging decision as to which card to take and how to deploy one's workers and assistants. A simple game of set collection and dice manipulation at heart, this presents a much meatier, more engaging experience than one might initially expect. Very impressed.

Doing arithmetic is unpleasant.

For such a light and frothy game, it has a lot of downtime. Blame this on the fact that it's a card drafting game, which means you really can't do any effective planning -- and the arithmetical puzzle you have to do each turn.

Unfortunately, the game adds an area majority layer on top of the arithmetic puzzle, which makes the game even more chaotic than it is.

This is another great design by J. ALexus Kevern. The gameplay is so simply but requires some deep thought.

This is a fantastic game. It is well put together and has interesting play elements. It can take some time to weigh all of your options, as you have to calculate the effects of all of your options (especially if the field was just wiped). This can add to AP prone players. However, the game still seemed to play with very tight scoring. I like pushing my luck to change a dice to a value I don't want and hope that I can place a card to the other side of it to change it again to a value I do want. Playing efficiently is the key and saving assistance for use in holding majorities over the investments.

 This is one of those games that can best be described as clever. It does not play like anything else I have played before, but it manages to still feel very intuitive and easy to grasp. This is a fairly quick playing game, but there are a lot of choices to it. There is a delicate balance between figuring out the puzzle of how to get the most points per round while also playing with the end game in mind. This mix of quick play time, intuitive rules, and tense choices is an enticing combination.

This is a neat dice manipulation game with an area control mechanic.  It's kind of an original idea, at least from my experience.  Each player has a board and rolls a set of dice at the start of each round.  They go on specific spots based on the board you start with.  Then a set of cards and a set of multiplier tokens are put out in the center of the table.  The cards are in between each of the multiplier tokens. 

Each player puts a number of pieces on a card on their turn to take it and the cards alter the dice on your board and look for a state (such as being odd or being less than 5, etc.) and score points if you achieve that state at the end of the round.  You can also use your pieces to stop the cards from altering dice but the more pieces you put out the more you have for the area control portion for the multiplier tokens.

I get that all sounds pretty confusing without actually getting to see the parts of the game I'm talking about.  I like the originality of the game and would certainly play this one again.  It didn't impress me enough to want to go out and get my own copy but still pretty good.

tl;dr: nice but overproduced/priced

These days every publisher needs to make sure their artwork and components are good. That is good as we are now getting lots of very good games that are very well produced. More than ever before. We are, unfortunately, also getting a lot of mediocre and shitty games with great art and components. Sometimes it even looks like they are just throwing those aspects at a design just to sell us a box of stuff with very little game. But that aside, it seems like there are more and more games where the publisher takes the 'nice bits' thing a bit too far. Just think of that useless huge 3D cardboard stand in Agra. This game also has this issue. It has oversized cards even though regular size cards would have been more than big enough and still have plenty of space for art. It also has these nice custom dice that are just regular D6es with some design elements added. The result is that this game costs a whopping $55 MSRP and that is just WAY too much for a deck of cards and some tokens and dice. This game scratches a similar itch as [thing=205046][/thing] for me and that game set me back €15. Now granted, that game does not have dice, so it will always be cheaper than this one, but the difference is staggering!
OK, end of rant (for now). How is the game?
Well, as I said: this kind of scratches the same itch as Capital Lux. It's equally abstract with a futuristic theme pasted on. It also features cards that modify stuff, though that happens in a very different way. But it's a nice puzzle to optimize your score during the round and setting yourself up for good end game scoring. It's a nice game. It's not a $55 big box strategy game.

Really didn't like this game. It feels entirely random and entirely solitaire-ish.

The puzzle of adjusting your dice could be fun, but the decisions are obvious and you have little control. Since you usually just take the best card for the moment, the light area control element ends up being random because taking a card you need is more important than trying to get one of the tokens. If you win one of the area bonuses then so be it.

It feels like the game is just missing something. Some element to tie the dice puzzle to the area control better, and something to add meaning to your decisions.

Not something I would choose to play again.

An interesting take on dice mitigation that doesn't take too long. It's a little bit weird trying to plan between turns, but other than that, the idea of getting majorities and multiplying those off the 12 cards you'll get makes sense, and using dice to influence both sides of a card in different ways is fun. A good puzzle to solve, and there are usually some options for you to pursue on each turn.

Enjoyable concept with some nice artwork and sci-fi theming.

After Origins we had a beer with a FLGS owner at Gordon Biersch. He was concerned about Sentient being a card game at such a high price point.  

That probably makes good business sense but it's totally worth it to me.  

GORGEOUS box art, combining glossy and matte.  Beautiful custom dice (I dislike generic d6es in otherwise nice games).  Mechanics that should cause AP but don't.  A noob friendly one hour play time.  And a primary mechanic that I've never encountered before and quite enjoy.

A good game overall. Need to make a good plan for the end game bonuses. Also, it would be good strategy to start working from the dice on the edge and then get to the ones in the center as cards will keep changing them.

I like the manipulation and plurality control in this game. The extremely sexy dice and truly excellent art really dress up its utterly abstract nature, which is good, because it's a game that deserves to be played, and with simply numbers on dice, rules and modifiers on cards, and scoring multipliers, I do not think it would get nearly the audience it deserves.

Nice game! I first thought "only 3 rounds, that will be be a quick filler game", but no! Each round is a puzzle on its own, trying to balance new bots with your dice and with your other bots, getting the right investors for your bots, and at the same time trying to thwart your opponent's plans! 

Will you get that high-value bot which does not work with your dice yet, and do some long-term planning to let another bot change the dice to make the first one work? Or will you avoid any risk and go for the lower-value bot that works perfectly with your dice as is? Or will you simply acquire a broken bot just to inject influence to trump your opponent's influence, and get that investor you're eye-balling?

 The game is up to 4 players, but because of the potential downtime I see this as a 2-player game. This game will likely get into our game collection that we take with us on summer holidays.

Will always be on the shelf. I love this game. I would rate it a point or two higher if it were more streamlined. Or, have another streamlined set. The amount of rules with all the add-ons is EXCESSIVE. Loses the flavor of a strategic type game. IMO to much time to invest, too slow, no streamlined offical rules= non-playable in a normal sense.

Like the idea of being able to fight an entire war in the Star Trek universe. But I felt some of the ship's combat values did not reflect the ships capabilities as they did in Star Fleet Battles.

[thing=1594][/thing] receives a much needed overhaul, and it appears it received the full [thing=37061]Star Fleet Battles[/thing] treatment in terms of complexity.  Even in its simplest form, it takes up a lot of space and time.  It NEEDS to be a computer game.  This is for fans of Star Fleet Battles who want to play fleet battles and control empires.

I thought I would really love this game. Hex and chit space wargame? That's exactly up my alley. Insanely complex? Bring it on! Except, unfortunately not. This game is not complex. It's insultingly simple.

From the moment you start reading the rules, one thing will start to become abundantly clear: you do not "play" Federation & Empire, not much anyway. I have the 2016 reprint with all the latest rules changes so this is the fairest review that can be given.

In F&E, what you actually do is faithfully remake the entire history of Star Trek, with a few minor accounting differences here and there. The game has an accounting ledger where you write in what you spend and where each turn. However, you can't build certain ships until certain turns, and you're just given them. Everything in the game is locked down by areas of space and turn count. It's like waiting until a certain time to be given permission to actually play this.

Underneath all that is clearly a robust wargame waiting to get out. Unfortunately, we couldn't even finish this because we were tired of playing "Mother May I" with a board game's rules. It was insulting from start to finish. Hard pass forever.

I have a soft spot for this as it was the first monster game I got plus I was a serious fan of SFB up through the original Captain's Edition. Have never actually gotten to play it.

RATING: 6
Beautiful components, great map and surprisingly neat rules, but almost completely unplayable unless you, and a number of friends can afford to quit work and start dedicating your life to the game. In fairness, there are some shorter scenarios than the full galactic war, but even they're huge. Given that Star Fleet Command is an almost perfect real time implementation of SFB it's a real shame that this hasn't been turned into a strategy (probably PBEM)game on the PC.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fairly tedious game with little to offer in and of
itself, but served as the ultimate scenario generator.
Unfortunately, in that role, the tremendous imbalance that
certain races (mainly drone users) have in giant fleet
SFB battles was made absolutely clear; my group never
favored such on their own, but this game opens up
with the Klingon-Kzin war, and even speed 20 drones in fleet
actions trump every other weapon system - a fact not
reflected in F&E itself, so IF you wanted to play out
a few interesting battles, you'd get wildly different
results from what the game depicts.

Talk about huge ... we found even small campaigns to be monumentally unplayable. Plus, it really has no feel for the theme.

I have the commander's edition.  Rotten, unimaginative, boring game on strategic combat in the Star Trek Universe.  A ridiculous attempt to transpose concepts of ground wargames (e.g. front lines, strategic movement) to space warfare.  I'm sure the new version is better: just look at how much longer the rulebook is!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have the original 1986 version, which has the advantage of being somewhat streamlined (if you can use the word in relation to this game at all).

It is still very clunky, with many things that need to be recorded on paper.  Definately not for the faint of heart.  But, there is no other game quite like it, and if you want a wargame of the Star Trek universe, and an indepth one, this is the only game in town.

Still, I can't help but redesign, in my head, certain aspects of it every time I play.  With just a little thought, this could be made a much better game.

(How about point tracks instead of written records for the economic aspects of the game?)

RATING: 1
Comments are based on the First Edition. The Coalition has more ships, more money, and a better production schedule.  With a predictable and consistent percentage based combat system, when does the miracle happen for the Allies?  Never. In short, the game is solvable with the right mix of builds and repairs for the Coalition.

The designer clearly assumed the Klingons would be attrited from a massive Kzinti homeworld assault. Instead, the Klingon player can use the Lyrans for cannon fodder on the outlying systems and pin the rest of the Kzinti fleet on their homeworld while building a massive fleet to swarm the Federation player with.

That, combined with an absurdly lengthy rulebook (I've read that the 2010 version is up to 146 pages), gobs of counters, obscene playing time, excessive record keeping and a complete lack of strategic command & control, make this game a complete turd.

Not the greatest game ever made, but there's a lot of meat here. The rules aren't necessarily as complex as they're made out to be.  In general the rulebook is well written and the rules work well together.  The complexity comes in the ways that the various rules interact.

RATING: 9
One of the best "deep" games I've ever played.  I've actually finished several games, beginning to end.

This game takes a special breed of war gamer... Someone who is not afraid to dig deep, who is fully prepared to abandon "life" for a while to conquer the galaxy.  Definitely not for those who think Axis and Allies is their "Monster Game."

And for those of you who think the rules read like "the tax code," try playing Star Fleet Battles.
Yes.  Very long and very paper intensive.

Caused endless arguments in my game group regarding the outcomes the CRT produced versus the outcomes if combat had been resolved tactically via Star Fleet Battles. As hard-core SFB players, we liked the game theme. As a stand-alone game, F&E was quite bland.

I have a strong love/hate relationship with this game.  I own 2 copies of the reprint and 2 of the original game and more additional countersheets than I care to reveal.  I will set this up and play it solo for month, carefully recording every turn's battles and results.  However, I don't know that I really enjoy it.  I've never played it "for real" as an adult against other players and I can't see that ever changing.  The "board" is a combination of two cheap mapsheets and its an inconvenient size for most tables, when combined with the fleet charts that you need.  All in all, its the game I've put the most into, but I can't really say its a great game.

Got this as a campaign system for SFB.  Played a bit, but the thing is just too unwieldy.  Useful as an illustration of the problem with space battles -- why stay and fight if you don't have to?  The game imposes an artificial command limit on fleet size to keep battles winnable.

Hmm..Star Fleet Battles is my all-time favourite.  Naturally I am interested in this game.  The game extended the tactical nature of SFB to a strategic scale.  Judging from the ratings here, it looks like Stephen Cole doesn't have the same design elegancy as on tactical scale battle.

Such potential... yet, I wonder if the creators ever 1) playtested the game, 2) finished a game, 3) found that many people enjoyed it in the published form.

Given the potential, I sincerely hope someone fixes it and re-releases it as an actually 'fun' game.

This is a game that is as advertised, meaning a monster sci-fi war-game that is going to take quite some time to play.  If you understand that going in you'll have a great time. If not, you can experience a lot of frustration at the length of the rules, filling out economic forms, etc.  The combat system is definitely unique and works well, giving you the feeling of massive forces slugging away for the fate of the galaxy.

While I think this game is a lot of fun, it is also massive and requires far too much time. Combat resolution and fleet management especially could really use an improvement, combined with some eco. That said, playing through a game really gives a sense of accomplishment, of having fought tooth and nail. I would definitely be interested in a remake that took care of the above problems, cutting the play time to something still long but perhaps within the realm of imagination.

This is THE game that I play.   Highly suited to PBEM using Vassal or Cyberboard, or you can play face to face.   Not for those who can't take a joke (die rolls can induce soul crushing despair).   Currently playing the game with four different groups of opponents (one game is face to face the others by PBEM).   Very complex, very customizable.   For those with an opinion on balance, it does have options for giving advantages or disadvantages to various empires.   New material and scenarios comes out periodically via Captain's Log or expansions (or updated old expansions).

For those looking for a deep, complex strategic game for the Star Fleet Universe, look no farther.

RATING: 10
This game is simply amazing.  It feels like everything I've ever wanted in a game is here, dialed up to 11.

Lots of units, lots of variety, lots of scenarios, lots of detail, lots of rules...

I'm becoming somewhat obsessed with it and I'm getting a little scared.

Out of Shrink but unpunched and unplayed.  Also includes an unpunched copy of Fleet Pack (Additional counters)

2010 version: Never managed to get it set up without realizing I'd rather be playing something else. For all I know, it could be a wonderful game - but it's just too epic in scope. 

Desire to part with: High.

One of my friends convinced me to play long ago. The rules are unbelievable complex and I had no idea what I was doing. I was soundly defeated. This game is only for the die-hard Star Fleet fan. If I ever tried it again I might up the rating, but right now I've got too many Eurogames to play.

A couple of excellent galactic wargame ideas.  Actually tried to play this once, but it collapsed under its own weight... thousands of counters, hundreds of pages... who has the time, much less the inclination?

A strategic/operational treatment of the SFB universe, which kind of fell flat, especially with very dry economic & combat systems.

Bought it in the late '80s after getting into SFB.  Never did get it to the table, probably never will at this point, but still nice to have in my collection.

Massive, sprawling wargame.  Takes a long time to setup and play.  There aren't enough counters in the edition I have to setup the game properly!  Interested to try out the new 2010 edition.

About the least fun you can have "playing games"--the production is almost the only fun part of the process, with the interminable battles and repair process being grim exercises in accounting and logistics.

I'd rate it higher if I could get someone to actually bother learning it with me. They all freak when seeing the rules and counters. =P

third reich comes alive in space.  Federation & Empire does for Star Fleet Battles what Third Reich did for Panzer Leader/PanzerBlitz.  this game is not for the ordinary gamer

There's a great game in here...somewhere. I want to like it for the subject matter, but at times it just seems tedious. Especially when all the rules aren't in one place. They're scattered through the various add-ons.

Way to complicated,  not a very easy game to get into, could have been so much more. Box has some damage, way it came when I got it.

Never played it but my brother claimes it could be compared to World in Flames regarding complexity.

Someday, I'd love to actually play the entire General War from beginning to end.

With a little work, the system could be adapted to a generic map for use in home-brew SFB campaigns.

Offbeat for me in the gaming area,but I enjoy this as an overview of the Star Trek universe.  Very Strategic view with ship squadrons across the light years.

This game...is long.  Lots of detail, a huge mega-game in any sense of the term.  Expect a full campaign involving all races to take literally months to resolve in weekend-long sessions (like, say, '6 months' as a good starting point).  And...that's a LOT of counters.  I mean...WOW.

For those who like fiddly details - managing economies and ship construction at the same time as fighting battles on borders...well, this game is as good as you could get.  For anything approaching a 'casual gamer', though?  It's a pass!

Perhaps only game I've seen that could surpass 'Advanced 3rd Reich' in complexity.

There is not another game like this. I have had the opportunity to play the first 10 turns twice over the years. I would love to play the campaign out. I'm up for Vassal/Skype play. I've also got Cyberboard but would need help with opening the game. I have bought every version listed here and every expansion every done. I have bought at least three copies of every counter sheet ever done minimum, up to six of some. I probably have 50K+ counters for this game.

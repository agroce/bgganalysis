Identify your partner and fulfill the task.
Only little luck but lots of analytical thinking helps to solve this game. 
To me, it can be a lot of fun! It can be very annoying, if your partner doesn't focus or doesn't get it!
The game material is great, the idea of the mask instead of dice is just precious and unique

A promising team deduction game, that doesn't reach its potential due to inconsistent gameplay experiences that depend heavily on the luck of encounters and exchanged information. Also a bit of downtime as players note and absorb the snippets of information.

One of the greatest deduction game of all time! One of the best semi-cooperative games of all time! The level of player interaction is very high. The theming of Inkognito is just fantastic! Gotta love the nun cell phone. PLEEZE make sure, though, that the players you're playing with UNDERSTAND the rules for showing cards; AND, make sure (from your previous gaming experience with them) that they play honestly! A violation of either of these principles would utterly destroy the game. And, I believe, it MUST be played with four, not three, players (haven't tried it yet with the new five-player variant). An extremely tense end game!

This one just got me from the first time I played it. I like deduction games in general, but this is the first game I've played in a while that actually felt tense to me. The unknown partnership feature is unique and interesting. This is not to say it's without its faults: aside from the usual pitfalls of deduction games (player error in showing cards or tracking answers), the movement mechanic can totally starve out some players, and the pictures on the cards could be a bit more distinctive (it's easy to confuse skinny and tall, or short and fat, for example). Overall, I found it interesting and well worth playing.

I like deduction games, but I was very disappointed with this one, which was tough - from reading the rules and seeing the board, I truly expected to love it.  The deduction part works well enough, but the board movement is wonky, and often works *against* the deduction part.  Mini Inkognito, the streamlined card version of this, works better, IMO, but even that&#039;s just okay.

Has some of the coolest game bits of any game out there, period.  And if you are lucky to play it with the right crowd, it can be quite a bit of fun.  I think the game is intended to be mysterious, but with a definite light-hearted carnival feel.  Therefore, the game plays better if played quickly and with less cut-throat secrecy.  It is important to remember that 1 of the other players is actually your ally - so too much suspicion adds too much tension to the game play and will likely result in a much longer game time.  Keeping the game light and fast will reduce the game to more of a family affair, but that should not be viewed negatively.  So grab a cocktail and a mask and enjoy a little mystery during carnival.

Wow, it's amazing that this design is almost 30 years old! Alex Randolph is a true genius, ahead of times in game design by a couple of decades...

Inkognito is a quite straightforward and light deduction game, played in pairs (it is really a 4-players only game), without knowing the identity of the partner.
By asking information about identity and build, players gather knowledge about their partner and their mission, as well as their opponents.

There is room for a bit of creative play and bluffing, and there is some luck involved (with the 2013 rule set luck is almost removed from movement, but there is some in which cards players blindly use to hide information), but the design stands high among the classics.
The components are gorgeous, and the "psycho-nun" is one of the most memorable gaming pieces ever.

It's almost unbelievable this was a quasi-mainstream game when it came out at the end of the eighties! I can still remember the TV commercials of a time when I was a kid...

First time was very fun. As the game teacher I went out of my way to make sure the game was moving along briskly by quickly noting observations and moving on. In this way I was trying to set an example for the other three players. I wanted them to write down the info and then contemplate on their downtime. I think it worked. If anything the other players perked up with more interest as the game went on. Once explanations were out of the way, things moved along quite well. Players discovered identities within a comfortable number of rounds and then set to work on the missions. My team thought we had it in the bag, but the other team surprised us with victory. After the game, everybody seemed to enjoy talking about what, when and how they discovered their partners. This subtle but very social aspect around the mystery of your partner and the secrecy of working with them really hits a special note that is rare in board gaming. If you like the idea of scheming with another person at the table to beat the other two, then this game is for you!

I love these stealth and deduction style games.  Inkognito has to have one of THE best hooks I have ever heard of in a game - it's a teams game, but you don't know who your partner is!  The deduction element is determining who your partner is.  The moment I read that I knew I just HAD to try this out!

Unfortunately, suffers from two large flaws.  (1) The secret missions are not all created equal.  some are simple and some are nearly impossible.  You really are at the mercy of which mission you have.  (2) Each time I've played this (twice), ~somebody~ has completely blown it and made the wrong deduction, thus pretty much blowing the game.  Blowing it in Sleuth or Clue only sets you back.  Blowing it in Inkognito essentially ends the game, and leads to an unsatisfying ending ("We won because he messed up" not "We won because we correctly deduced our partner.")

I like this more than everyone in my gaming group.  It has huge flaws but the premise is just so unique and entertaining.

We found the rules in the German MB edition (and the games cabinet translation) to be decisively unclear on at least three points and this frustrated us enormously in the first game.

Versión clásica de MB. Juego de deducción que tiene mucha más miga de la que aparenta. No estoy de acuerdo con quienes piensan que se trata de un juego que se juega en silencio. Los comentarios y la "actuación" de los jugadores para intentar hacer que los demás deduzcan "erróneamente" también me parece importante. El juego tiene dos fases claras, en la que cada jugador tiene tres adversarios más. Pero sobrepasada esta fase, que acaba justo cuando uno de los jugadores reconoce a su par, comienza la segunda parte, en la que es más importante el faroleo y el despiste, a través de verborrea y engaño con las cartas, que la deducción. Un jugador atento puede averiguar que ya se ha hecho una pareja sólo por su cambio de actitud en la partida, si estos jugadores no lo saben disimular bien. De modo que se puede deducir información sin ni siquiera pedir cartas, solo con estar atento... Estéticamente una joya. Tema muy conseguido. Como en la mayoría de juegos de deducción, si uno de los jugadores no se entera bien de las reglas al principio, puede arruinar la partida entera sin darse cuenta.

I like this game. The deduction elements are actually pretty light, but it's still a lot of fun with the right people. The bits are fantastic, and for people willing to get into the theme it's a great time. Can offer some nice tension when trying to find your partner quickly and complete your mission before your opponents complete theirs and find you out. Very, very short though... or rather, has the potential to be very, very short since it's easier in this game than in other deduction games to sort of luck into answers early on. I don't think I'd want to try it with 3 players.

Normally I love deduction games, but this fell flat. The “deduction” element is a little too easy, and you can also get lucky at the beginning and get some good cards (and be shown some) which make you able to deduce something right from the get go….  In my first game, some players didn’t understand the rules entirely, so the game went on for too long; and even if the game takes 99 minutes, which the box states, it’s too long. I’ve heard some players say it takes 45-60 to play, and if that’s the case most of the times, it’s probably a good game. But it took a couple of hours, and that’s too long for a game which involves randomness in how you can move on the board and too light deduction. 

While the “doll”-thingy is a funny mechanic, which is probably better and more unique than dice, it’s sort of a gimmick and it’s extremely frustrating when you know what to do but you aren’t allowed due to a poor “roll”… Anyway, once you find out who your partner is, and you give and receive clues and find out what your secret mission is, that’s when you feel a sense of accomplishment. It’s awesome when you win and shake hands and say “mission accomplished”! But unfortunately the path to that victory isn’t as interesting and engaging as I had thought it would be.

Interesting secret identity / team game with novelty movement device. However the deduction element seems rather easy (compared with Mystery at the Abbey or even PI, say) and waiting for other players to make their notes can be boring.

RATING: 8
The missions aren't so well-balanced, and it seems like luck plays a large role in the deduction process (ask the right person the right question, and you can figure out who's who in a couple of turns; but if you don't, it may take several), but... this game is just plain fun!  It doesn't take too long, so you can play it again, and there's a lot of satisfaction in figuring out who your partner is and getting the mission done.

Traded to Friendless. Received in Maths trade.

1st game. One player passed incorrect information so my partner was confused. We managed to win because I had figured out all the information, helped greatly by the other opponent passing me his white cards mistakenly thinking that I must be his partner. This game would be much better played by four people who know the game. It ran a little long but would have been shorter without the screwup and the occassionally inconvenient movement options.
2nd game. With 4 experienced gamers this is a VERY simple game. Deduction is quite easy. It has a decent amount of tension based on not knowing how much your opponents know or your partner at first too. 
3. Good game, easy to learn. fun. tension of not knowing how far your opponents have progressed.

I can imagine this could be a very fun couples game for Kami and me and another couple to play.

Played the new RGG version. Yeah, the bits are nice. In my one play, after playing for an hour or so the game broke due to a transcription error of one of the clues. In the end it's still just a deduction game, and I'm just not a fan of the genre (Mystery of the Abbey, Sleuth, etc.). Oh yeah, and completely losing your turn by rolling no movement colors is kind of ridiculous. The diplomat has no front. Creepy.

I had very high hopes for this game, but I've found it to be somewhat disappointing.  It is too likely to end with someone figuring out the solution by a lucky guess rather than by deduction.  However, it is a truly beautiful game.

Components: Fun multi-part pawns and masked marble man. The paths on the board are difficult to follow.

Experience: Very clever deduction game. There is so little information to discover, and because each player is assigned a unique identity, aspect, and mission, process of elimination works well in our favor. It's as fun to talk about it afterward as to actually play it.

I have only played this once. I think I enjoyed it so much because my son thought I was his partner and I knew he wasn't. He kept winking at me and saying, "mom, mom". I really need to try it again to see if it is really as fun as I remember.

Top notch idea.  But the nun, record keeping, and getting bounced to the edge of the board seriously got on my nerves.  Brutally slow first play (2.5 hours?!!!).  I was praying it would end.  Oddly enough, I'd like to play again.  With a better tempo, I doubt these issues would bother me so much.

Twice I have lost this game because of errors on the part of my 'partner'.  All I needed was the handshake and both times my partner refused to shake my hand, costing us the game!

[1 play] I had played the Inkognito card game first and liked it.  It's been a while, so I'm not sure how I'd compare the two.  But I enjoyed the board game version.  The multiple-movement system is reminiscent of Scotland Yard, but with a randomizer.  I like the way you identify your partner at the end, with the risk that they'll reject you.

Had a blast with this one... turns out each side knew who their partners were fairly quickly; but one side knew how to achieve their mission quicker.

One turn from Fiddlebottom getting to #7, my son called out my fat man... and Bubble snickered as he admitted he was a wee bit portly, but, alas, he was not Lord F.

RATING: 5
Based on 4 plays.
+ Random movement points pose a challenge every turn
+ Separate gadget for randomizing the movement (it makes a loud noise, though)
> The game may be over in 5 minutes or in 1.5 hours.
- The theme doesn't not fit the rules at all.
- Lots of downtime
- Strong imbalance on objectives
- The game may stall when both sides know the objectives and decide to block each other.

Updated after 4 plays: 7->5. I realized I'm not that interested in this game. There are lots of better games: I just wish I would find a good deduction game.

Loverly bits, nice idea of finding your partner and the mission, but the movement seemed too random. The map is large, but you could easily only get one step which takes you nowhere. If you can't get where you want, you can't ask any questions, and your game stops there. There's a good deal of sitting, waiting, whilst other players are passing cards around. Finally you get your turn and oh, I can't move anywhere useful, I can't ask a question, your turn. Disappointing.

This reminds me of Scotland Yard which I think I like a little better.  Once we deduced our partners, etc., the end game was a little wierd--we just kept landing on the opposition to send them across the board and away from their goal, or if our partner, then we would send each other across the board toward our goal.

Perfectly what a deduction game should be - logic, tactics (although thin) and most of all rising tension as some figure it out.  Biggest draw back is the need for very careful record keeping - which can be a bit of a struggle for what is really only a family game

The first boardgame I had when I was a teenager -besides Monopoly! A quite entertaining game by Leo Collovini where each player must know who is his partner and once he is aware, both must complete the mission assigned. To investigate, they move throughout the Venice map locations to get some info off the other players and the ambassador. You can use face gestures to inform about your identity as well. Mythic carnevale-like gimmick to decide movement. 

Three players game is crappy, this is just for four people.

Inkognito was a game I never played as a kid an I always wanted it.  I knew nothing about the game but the components had me sucked it right from the beginning. I never did get a copy, nor know anyone who had it. So excited me jumped at the chance when I was able to get the new edition at a good price. The deduction aspect in Inkognito is just a shade more difficult than Clue, but not by much. Keeping track of the clues is a bit more of a headache though. Turns don't come quickly and waiting for your turn is an unfortunate bore. There really is nothing to think about or plan when it isn't your turn. The different missions range from stupid easy to annoyingly difficult, if only because some missions require a great deal of running around the board. There is some fun in finally figuring out your opponent and conspiring to win the game. And it really is a beautiful looking game with an odd movement mechanic that I enjoyed. Too bad this one does miss the mark by enough to make it a game I'd rather not revisit. Oh well- it was worth playing it just to satisfy my inner 10-year-old who never had the chance.

Inkognito, it's a deduction game and while I'm not a 'fan' of those type of games, I do enjoy them from time to time.

So, it's a 2 versus 2 game. The first team to 'correctly' complete their mission wins. Problem is you don't know who your partner is or what your mission is. Each person holds a card that tells them which identity they are, which of 4 of their pawns they are and 1/2 of the code that will tell them which mission they must accomplish.

I've owned it for a while, but haven't gotten it to the table. It turned out to me more enjoyable then I expected and I'm anxious to try it again.

Edicion moderna del mismo juego que MB publico a finales de los 80s. Es uno de esos, como el hotel, el hero quest y el cruzada estelar, que se ha comprado mas por morriña del clasico que tuvo que por motivos estrictamente jugables. 

Tematicamente el juego esta ambientado en la venecia renacentista (creo). jugablemente se juega por parejas (2vs2) que no se conocen y deben cumplir una mision cooperativamente, asi que buena parte del juego consiste en averiguar quien es tu compañero mediante un juego deductivo estilo "mastermind". 

En mi opinion, tematicamente transmite poco, y jugablemente es algo mas lioso de lo aconsejable. en resumidas cuentas: no me convence mucho. De hecho, no ha vuelto a ver mesa desde entonces.

This clever deduction game takes Clue to another level.  It has a double deduction issue where you not only have to solve the "who done it" type puzzle, but also figure out who your partner is.  It is a great little game.

I played a really weird game of this, it was over before everyone even got their first turn. This doesn't seem like it should be too common but also it shouldn't be that rare for a few lucky hints to really make the game end quickly. It's hard to rate after just one game where something odd happened but that something like this can happen doesn't bode well. I could see it being an interesting game, but I'm also not convinced there'd be enough deduction to really make it interesting.

Inkognito is an interesting twist on Clue (having unknown teams and unknown objectives) and is not a bad game at all.

It's a fun little deductive logic game.  It's a partnership game, but you don't know who your partner is.  You try to figure out your partner and your team's goal, and then meet the goal.  Update 2014/09/20: Played the new edition for the first time.  I was annoyed by the differences, but it's okay when you get used to it.  Seems like the cards are harder to tell apart.

This is a game my mother bought to enjoy on travels when she was young and so she passed it on to me. I learned to play it on holidays with my family and we always played it with 4. I love this game because you don't know anything but yourself when you start. Besides the questions you ask other players, you could get confused with what you think is true because of their behaviour. There's always tension to play this because everyone wants to be the first to know his companion and quest. If you play this, play it seriously, because it's  annoying when someone spills too much info or is just a general spoiler by acting too obvious. =)

Initial rating: 6.5 (February 2014)

GORGEOUS game. The components look very beautiful on the board. As my favorite mechanic is hidden roles, I thought this was going to be great. I liked most of the game. I LOVE that you can mess with other players, the secret body language, the final handshake, the deductions, all of that is great. Very reminiscent of Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg, a game currently in my top ten favorite games. 

The movement is so random, you can actually lost turns without accomplish anything, however most times you can do something so you need to move your 4 pawns carefully.
I really like the first half of the game, in which you have to find your partner. I’m not sure I like the second half, the random missions (due to the restrictive movement), in this case the movement is a pain because you need an specific pawn to go to an specific location, this is not as fun and can take a long time to accomplish. When you find your mission, you can be very close to accomplish it or (almost impossible) be very far from it, this part almost make the first part meaningless, if the mission is hard to get, it doesn’t matter that the first team know each other a long time ago, the second team can actually win the game, and I don’t like that. If a team already knows his opponents are trying to accomplish their mission, the game can drag a long time as each player undo what the other accomplished. 

I also dislike that the paper aids provided in the game are actually printed on one side, what a waste of paper. In Inkognito, it is harder than other deduction games to make a critical mistake giving information, but that can still happen and if it does, it breaks the game.

Still I had fun with the game, so I’m rating it a 6.5 (due to the first part of the game and the great production values) . Also I’m keeping my copy for now. I would love to play 5 players to see how this goes. 

Current Rating: 6.5

I sold my copy of the game due to the random movement, however the explainer got wrong how this works so the final missions are not as hard to accomplish as I thought they would be (when 2 players meet, the active player can send the other player to any space on the board). However the ambassador missions are harder because you have to block his space practically declaring to the other team that you know what is your mission. Still the game is a bit better than I thought.

I also played a 3 player game. I enjoyed it but it has some problems, mainly, that a player can get really screwed without doing anything in his turn because he can’t reach other players. This happens because the pawn density is a lot less than in a 4 player game, so in our game. one player could not ask 3 times in a row so he (and his partner) lost the game without any fault of his own. Definitively a 4 player game.

Current Rating: 6.5

Probably my favourite deduction game - at least it was before I tried Mr. Jack, which is 2 player only. I like the twist through which you play in pairs but don't know who your partner is. You need to:

* Figure out who your partner is
* Figure out what your objective is (generally get a piece to location X or move the Ambassador piece to the same location as a specified enemy piece)
* Achieve your objective.

Along the way smart opponents who are ahead of you hinder you, but so can recalcitrant partners (once you've figured out who your partner is, you can be left thinking "oh for f***'s sake, ASK ME A QUESTION so I can show you the cards you need to see!" while he shoots off on an irrelevant goose chase).

The tension mounts as you close in on the solution and wonder if the other team are almost there too - only one team will win

Only played it once back in the early 90's but liked it a lot. Problem is you really need 4 players. Now I go to a regular games club should be a lot easier to arrange. Trying to track down a copy. Got one from Italy, apt really.

Each player is a spy in Venice. One of the other players is your partner. To win the game, you need to identify which one it is, and then complete a secret mission.

Like most deduction games, you have to be sure to not make a mistake in order to not ruin the game.  Inkognito has really great pieces that add to the gameplaying experience.  I was a little disappointed by the deduction aspect - it's much easier than, say, Sleuth.  A couple questions coupled with the ambassador can pretty easily reveal who your partner is.

RATING: 7.5
Note: Rating the old version, not sure what has changed in the new version.

Interesting deduction game with a twist. I'm a little torn over the game. The deduction bit (telling 2 false and 1 truth) and mission (completing a mission with your partner) is fantastic. Really thematic, very tense, and everyone loved it.

What didn't work was the stupid movement system which cause a great deal of unnecessary downtime. I think this part could've been cleaned up tremendously or changed to make it quicker. Overall, the feel of the game was great, and I think will flow faster with further plays.

Szerintem ez egy kimondottan érdekes és különleges játék főleg ahhoz képest, hogy majd 30 éves. A szabályrendszer nagyon egyszerű, de azért kicsit szokni kell, az akcióválasztós figura ötletes. Maga a dedukció, bár különleges, elég egyszerű, gyorsan összeállnak a szükséges információk és onnantól már csak az a kérdés, hogy a küldetést milyen gyorsan, könnyen tudjuk teljesíteni, illetve az ellenfelek ezt mennyire tudják akadályozni. Nagy hátránya, hogy kizárólag négy fővel van értelme, és az ilyen jellegű játékhoz talán egy picit rövidebb játékidőt is el tudnék képzelni.

Beautiful game, the idea of having to find your partner is a great one! Players must be careful not to give away wrong information, since that can really spoil the game. There is some luck involved and that can be frustrating, but the atmosphere makes up for it. And even if it does not plays fast (more than one hour), players will hardly be able to tell! It is a pity that it only works with exactly 4 players.

It's a cool deduction game, but when you suck at deduction games, it kind of lessons the enjoyment a bit.  Maybe it'll grow on me.  It seems that a series of bad shakes of the giant nun can really screw someone over and lessen their enjoyment of the game, and you basically have to wait for your partner to figure out who you are and essentially do all the work.  Despite those drawbacks, the board is beautiful, and the player pieces (after assembly), are really top-notch.  It looks great on a table.

Intrigues a Venise

C'est le Carnaval à Venise. La nuit est pleine d'animation et de sons joyeux, de voix exhubérantes, des rires et des chansons de personnages masqués qui dansent dans les ruelles étroites. 

Mais cette joyeuse ambiance cache aussi les activités de quatre sinistres personnages, quatre maîtres du trompe-l'oeil capables de se déguiser à tel point qu'ils sont impossibles à reconnaître...

Inkognito is similar to Clue for me: I love the deduction, the theme (even more so than Clue), and the components...but hate the random movement. The "tells" for the different characters, the tough decisions behind which cards to show and which ones to hold back, and the thrill of not knowing who's who are all fun.

Unfortunately, no amount of cleverness can make up for pulling crappy marbles every turn, and that's just not fun for me.

This is a secret partner deduction game for four people.  By receiving three secret cards at the beginning of the game that determine your attribute, mission, and identity you start your mission.  Your mission consists of finding out who your partner is first and foremost.  You do this by moving your pawns along the board and landing on other players' pawns and asking them a question.  The opposing pawns answers the question by handing over a few cards with one or two of them having to be true.

You ultimately take the information you receive from everyone and deduce who your partner is, what your collective mission is together, and than completing it.  The idea of the game was so genuine to me when I originally started playing this I was able to overlook some of its flaws.  One flaw being it can get confusing to new players what cards you are allowed to pass, how many have to be true, which cards to actually pass.  I have had one or two games ruined by a player being a tad bit confused with how those mechanics work. 

A very fun secret partner deduction game, if you can overlook the possibility of confusing new players with a few of the tricky rules, that is a gem of a game that may have lost a bit of it's sheen to this player.

Classic deduction game playable only by three or four, but that yields fun in spades when it's opened and no player makes a mistake (intentionally or not). 

The blend of deduction and team work is superb, since it's quite easy to mislead other players giving the right (or wrong, depending on your view) cards or asking another player very often (a secret plot going?). Some rounds a player even stood up to shake hands with the partner and nobody else did. 

Besides, Inkognito is one of the games with the most intense atmosphere ever - the lovely game materials display Venice outstandingly, and the mixture of gestures in silence and frequently very devious play is exhilarating.

Gioco di grande successo di bluff e intuito. Ricorda in qualche modo Cluedo. Anche in Inkognito bisogna scoprire delle identità segrete ed ogni avversario ha degli indizi da mostrare. Oltre all'intuito per vincere si necessita di un po' di fortuna. Un gioco godibile e innovativo per l'anno in cui è uscito. Oggi fa vedere qualche ruga.

My wife was bent on getting this game, and we were lucky enough to get a copy. We totally love the components of the game. The deduction aspect of it is rather simple, and event though it does not look that easy on the first try, you will figure out who your partner is in very few questions. The one thing to stress out to players is that they need to be disciplined about the notes they take, as the game is very likely to be ruined by a player not being fully engaged. I took to heart the suggested methodology of using the deduction sheets, and tracked the information received and the information sent in different sides of the page, and that worked like a charm. The visual/physical aspects used to reveal your identity work when people are close enough, but as someone put it, some big guy blowing kisses as Madame Zsa-Zsa is probably creepy. Also, winking is less obvious than pulling your left ear lobe. Regardless, they worked for us (we usually play as a family) and I think they work best to confirm your identity to your partner once things are good. Lastly, a couple things. First, be mindful of your screen/passport and set it to the side so when leaning towards the board you don't turn it over. I will probably try and find a better fit for this. Second, stress the fact that you can pass your mission/character info to your partner once you are sure of their identity. My daughter missed this part until I passed her my card twice, meaning it took us an extra round to start our common mission.

Inkognito is currently sweeping my circle of gaming friends, and they're all becoming addicted to it one by one.  It's not quite like any game I've ever played, and I feel that it deftly blends elements common to other games in a unique and interesting way.  Many critics claim that the missions are unbalanced; but while some missions are admittedly more difficult than others, this has never presented itself as the sole reason why one team has won over another.  All in all, the concept, theme, and above all the blatant paranoia experienced by all players make this one of my clear favorites.

RATING: 6
Three stage race to first deduce who your partner is, second to then trade mission info and lastly both of you to complete the mission. The deduction phase is easy so lacks the logical layers and open information of classic Cluedo. Though the deduction is quick in Inkognito, there is still a feeling of downtime despite allowing only one meeting and shaking the ugly Nun of Destiny during turns; there is nothing of interest for observers as cards are passed, and the body type cards can cause some confusion. However, things do become intriguing as you move your pawns (hopefully, as the Nun may not allow it which will frustrate some) which may imply a gradual setting up of the mission. Didn't use the agent facial clues as grown men feel uncomfortable about it.

Very fluffly deduction game. I'm quite bad at it. Gorgeous board. Barely gets any play because it's really only for four players. Extra point for being a partnership game.

The biggest problem with this game is that it is really easy to make a mistake. With deduction games, a mistake can break the game. In deduction games like Clue and Sleuth, it's hard to inadvertently give away the solution to be solved, the card or cards taken away from the game (whose identity you must discover) are usually safely hidden.

In Inkognito, you're basically playing a mini game of Clue with every player. In Clue, the cards to be discovered are in a safe place. In Inkognito, they are all in your hand, so you can accidentally show cards you shouldn't show! When you reveal information to your opponent, you show him at least one cards that is "true" (i.e. a card that has to be discovered); all the other cards can be false. This is another source of error: you could end up carelessly showing your opponent cards that are all false.

Superb production quality. A medium to light deduction game with a bit of tactics and a great secret partnerships mechanic that is almost, but not quite a casual game. Plays very well with the unofficial variant rule that a player may never show a grey card other than its mission card. Rounds are somewhat slow, but the game usually ends in a few rounds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A lot of deduction/hidden-movement games can feel very samey, but Inkognito focuses on the unique idea that you don't know who your partner is, or your shared objective, so you must share knowledge with everyone until you feel confident enough to send a covert nudge to your teammate. Even better, your ability to win still relies mostly on your personal ability to read the clues, and a weak teammate won't necessarily drag you down. 

Overall, this was a very charming and novel experience. For me, this is my preferred deduction game, while games like Whitechapel will mostly serve as a temporary distraction.

It's a good game with an original idea. I like quite a bit, and cause I use to win my playmates it's fine for me.

But IMHO it has not a huge replay-ability. So for me it's a game to play once in a long time. 

I don't recommend you to play with 5 players cause the player who controls the ambassador is not going to enjoy it as much as the others.

The game can be divided into two phases: in the first, you attempt to identify your partner; in the second, you attempt to complete your mission, which can include identifying an opponent by name. The mystery partnership and the multiple identities on the board make for some fun table talk, and the Phantom of Prophecy is perhaps the coolest game piece I own. 

The problem, if you can call it that, is that one person making a mistake in information passing can lead to a whole breakdown.

OMSCHRIJVING: Semi-coöperatief misleidings- & deductiespel.
Tijdens het carnaval in Venetië, bevinden zich tussen de feestende massa een aantal geheimagenten (= de spelers).
In eerste instantie dienen de geheimagenten zo snel mogelijk hun compagnon te vinden in het feestgedruis en hun vijanden te misleiden. Zodra de partner gevonden is, moeten de duo's hun gezamenlijke missie dringend vervullen. Het team dat dit als eerste doet, wint het spel. (Bij 3 spelers is één geheimagent spoorloos verdwenen, en moet de achterblijver zo snel mogelijk Venetië verlaten omdat hij ontmaskerd dreigt te worden!)

--> 3 tot 4 spelers

One of the best deduction games that I've ever played.  In Venice's carnival everybody wears a costume, so nobody knows who is who.  Players are secret agents that have to deduce which is their partner to perform a special mission, breaking together a hidden code first.

I've always enjoyed Scotland Yard, so it seemed natural that I would enjoy this.  I did enjoy my first game, although it ended quite abruptly.  I really like variable missions.  I also really like trying to determine who your ally is.  Unfortunately, depending on which cards you happen to see, some players may have a much easier time of this.  Still, it was pleasant enough that I tracked down a copy of my own.

If you aren't wowed by the production value of this boardgame you have no soul.  This easily wins for the coolest pieces and playing tool ("Psycho Nun") along with a downright gorgeous board.  

I think that the game itself is nice.  A neat deduction game where you control the information that you give to other players.  I like the potential for bluff.  Perhaps "Dastardly Dan" is a bit too powerful, but who cares I enjoyed the experience. 

I can't imagine playing this in card game form.  While the game play is neat.  At its core I don't know how great a game it is, but the experience of playing this  on a board with these pieces, plus the cool endgame condition, makes this a winner in my book.

A fun deduction game.  I like that not only are you trying to figure out who your partner is, but also what your mission is and how to thwart your opponents.  Unfortunately, when you're not involved in an inquiry, it can drag, so the amount of downtime drags this down from being a great game.

The missions are unbalanced, and luck plays a large role. But Inkognito is a light deduction game, and I haven't played one that's more fun. I love that you're working with a partner, but you have to work to figure out who your partner is. And you never know for sure who's going to win, as I discovered when my partner made a (hilarious) game-losing error. The design probably doesn't deserve to be as much fun as it is. I'd love to see some of the ideas reimplemented elsewhere.

I enjoy deduction games quite a bit and this one fell abolutely flat for me.  The deduction part is overly simplistic and the movement aspect slows the game down tremendously without adding anything significant.  It causes the game to be far too long for what it is.  I'm also usually a fan of dice, but there the deduction is so routine that a couple good or bad dice rolls can swing the game.  Bumped from a three to a four for the cool looking dice shaker.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a deduction game combined with a chase game much like Scotland Yard or Letters from Whitechapel.  Now, I'm not a big fan of either deduction games or those chase style games.  However, this one wasn't terrible and I did enjoy it a bit.

The game consists of each player controlling 4 pawns of different sizes (short, tall, skinny, and fat) and using this strange contraption to determine what moves they are allowed to do each turn to move about the board and interview people to gather information.  This information is useful because each player has 1 of 4 hidden identities and is also actually only 1 of the 4 pawns they control since each player also has a unique size.  Finally, each player has half of a mission set (denoted by a letter from A-D) and is partners with another player.  Their two mission letters tell them what action they need to take to end the game.  Got all that?

Information is discovered by landing your characters on other player's characters at which point they give you 3 pieces of information and one of them needs to be true.  Each interview they need to give you different combinations of this information so eventually you build a profile on each one.  There is also an ambassador who when you land on his space allows you to interview any player and get just 2 pieces of information, one of which still needs to be true.

Now, all of this is very cleverly designed but there are a couple issues for me with how it works.  First of all, when you interview the ambassador (easily the most powerful action you can take in the game) you get to choose where to put him next...so why wouldn't you just put him right next to one of your figures and farm him turn after turn.  This actually happened in our game.  The same can even be said about just interviewing other players.  After questioning them you can put them right next to your character and try to go after them again the following turn.  My other problem with the game is that not all missions are created equal.

For example, there are missions that require you to move an opponent's piece to a certain numbered space.  This is one of the more difficult missions because you not only need to discover this is your mission by first discovering who your partner is and what their half of the mission is but also you need to discover which of your opponents then is the target character (which requires figuring out both the color and size of that particular pawn) and THEN you need to move the opponent to that space.

By contrast some missions require you to move yourself to a target space.  That simply requires you to find out who your partner is and what half of the mission he has.  If that's your mission you don't care at all about the opponents, you just move yourself to the target space.  And moving yourself around the board is a lot easier than moving an opponent's piece.

Honestly, those two things, especially the second  brought this game down from one that despite its mechanics was clever enough to enjoy from time to time to another in a list I will avoid.  I will say that the components are pretty nice though.  The stylized pawns are neat to look at, although some of the sizes on both the pawns and the cards can be difficult to tell apart (the fat one is also short and the skinny one is also tall).  The board is beautiful, although some of the movement lines can get jumbled and hard to decipher their destinations.  The shining jewel though is really the contraption I mentioned used to determine your movement actions each round.  It's hard to explain without actually seeing it but at first I didn't think it would work very well but it actually did and is an original way to randomly determine actions.

Extremely fond memories. It is a long game that can go a bit too slow in some parts. But the excitement of figuring who of the 3 players your secret partner is and what your mission is can make up for that. Secrecy and collusiveness are fun!
Not sure if working in teams qualifies as a cooperative game but it is a great game experience that I haven't seen in this form since. And that sure makes up for slow beginnings, me thinks.
I am not a fan of the 3 player variant, this is meant for 4 and should be played as such.

This is my favourite deduction game (Zendo is excluded for being an [i]induction[/i] game) which isn't saying much as I don't like many deduction games...

But, this does a lot of decent and interesting things. The missions don't appear to be particularly balanced, the dice roller thing is a little frustrating (not being able move that one spot you need to win) and the chance that, if someone chooses poorly what card they play you may find out who they are on turn 1 all limit how good this game can be, but the stylised player pieces and the rest of the game win me over.

My feelings on Inkognito need to be understood in the context of my inability to appreciate or even understand others' appreciation for such revered deduction games as Black Vienna, Code 777, and Sleuth. I clearly lack that part of my brain that can enjoy or fathom the possibility of enjoyment of a deduction game. So it should come as no surprise that Inkognito joins the ranks of Black Vienna, Code 777, and Sleuth as yet another board game that simply wasn't for me. I tried it primarily because of one particular amazing component in the game, but also because it has the novel twist of pairing the players up into teams without telling you who is your teammate and making you figure it out for yourself. It sounded like a novel concept and looked enticing too, but in practice it proved to be as rote and mechanical as all of its brethren. It might be that all deduction games remind me of the logic games section of the LSAT entrance exam for law school, or it might be that they seem to simply be a record-keeping exercise, but regardless, I realize I should probably give up on the genre at some point and leave it to those who can appreciate its hidden depths.

This game is every bit as creepy looking as the pictures indicate.  Played my first game at BGG.Con '06 and discovered who my partner was right off the bat.  I got a bit annoyed because she wouldn't show me her mission card even though I kept sending her mine so she'd get the hint -- so I couldn't help her.  I didn't mind the team win, but it was exasperating to have her complain about how hard it was to fulfill the mission afterwards.  I couldn't even work to keep the other team from fulfilling theirs because I didn't know what it was!

1st impressions: Showing its age a little. Really nice idea but I can see that games don't always 'work'. Your turns can be quite frustrating if you fail to get the roll you need and can take a while to come around as other people stare at their cards figuring out what to pass.
Might be interesting with a card-based move selection system rather than roll and move and more balanced missions.

Initial impression after one play.  Little disappointed, but it definitely seems to be a game that you need to play more than once to know what you're doing so maybe I'm not giving it a fair shot.

It just seems a bit more like a logic puzzle than a deduction game like I was hoping for.

I LOVE the pieces, they were my main draw.  The deduction element wasn't all that satisfying.  Game feels very lucky and swingy, you could happen to pick your teammate to question off the bat, depending on the cards handed you, you could figure someone out in 2 questions, or it may take more than 4. Some game ending missions likewise can be really easy to accomplish, or require knowing other players.

I prefer my deduction games more spartan- for example Black Vienna is my favorite because of its simplicity. The obvious counter-example would be Clue, which has a lot of BS in the mechanics that has nothing to do with the deduction aspect. Inkognito is more like Clue, in my view. There is all this crap like pawns moving around the board, silly limitations to your movement based on some thingamabob that you shake each turn to see what color balls - representing your movement options - are available this turn. 

I hated my one and only play of this- it felt like I had to wait forever just to do anything thanks to the random limitations on what actions I could take. It isn't fun when you pass 4 turns in a row (equivalent to about 20 minutes sitting at the table) because the one action you need doesn't randomly come up. In Black Vienna there are random limitations to the kinds of questions you can ask but it is not nearly as constricting and actually introduces an interesting card management problem. 

I would play this again to see if my experience was a statistical anomaly but to be honest - above and beyond my issues with the randomness - I found the structure of the game itself to be fundamentally uninteresting. There are just other better deduction games out there. You can keep the plastic bits and nice board- I'll keep the better game.

Alex Randolph & Leo Colovini; This won the Spiel des Jahres Special Award for "Beautiful Game" in 1988; It's Carnival time, and everyone wears a mask, incognito. Pawns move, through streets and canals, on a map of Venice. This game is a great time for great spies. Each player must discover, via a Clue-like system, which of the other players is his partner, then work together to accomplish a secret mission. Of course, it's also fun to lure your opponents into thinking that you are a friend. This is a team game in which your first task is to find your teammate. Best with 4 players.

[MB 1988 edition] Really good deduction game for 3 or 4 players. The limited range of players is its main drawback.

[2013 edition] The new edition supports also a fifth player, which plays the ambassador. While not as excellent as the 4-player game (which remains the best in my opinion) it is still quite good.

I like the deduction involved in this game and the race to find your partner before the other pair of players. Sometimes the end of the game goes on a bit long, though.  Two of the three games we've played have involved all players knowing their partners and objectives but having to wait repeated turns in order to get the movement combination needed to get to the location needed for their win condition.

:trash:CLÁSICO. Mi juego de deducción favorito. La ambientación es fantástica, los compomentes buenos y la mecánica adictiva, rápida y original. Se juega sin hablar, y es el juego donde los silencios valen más que mil palabras. Además, es muy sencillo, pero depende de que todos los jugadores se lo tomen en serio, para que la partida no sea una perdida de tiempo.

It's a deduction game (yay), with random opportunities available to you on your turn (interesting, but sometimes frustrating and debilitating), and mystery partnerships.  Much later, [thing=25951][/thing] would use a similar blind partnership deduction notion, and both suffer from a particular problem, for my tastes at least:  Although you can help your teammate once you know who it is, you can only help when you have the opportunity to do so, and it's very possible that one player carries the whole team.  Still, each game has its charm and fun.

Interesting deduction game. After two games it seems that the ambassador ruins the game, it makes the game just too easy, but maybe after couple of games more I can say for sure.. at the moment the game would deserve rating of 7 without the ambassador.

Good components, excellent theme.It doesn&#039;t require particular tactics, but it&#039;s pure fun (even with 3 players)! I cannot describe the sensation when two players accomplish their common mission while the others haven&#039;t any clue about who their partners are! A bit of attention (and of honesty) is required when passing the card, otherwise the game can be spoilt.

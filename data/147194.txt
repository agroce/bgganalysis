Boring category word game. The main problem is the rather specific category you have to find. Nice idea but does not work as a game.

I enjoy trivia games in general.  It's not just knowing the answer to a question (otherwise boring), it's making the connection of previous answers that is extremely gratifying.

Great trivia game. Not as elitist as trivial pursuit etc, but still likely to alienate players that don't enjoy those types of games.

Interesting trivia game.  As with most trivia games though you eventually learn all the answers.  Some of the links are a bit too much of a stretch.

Below average filler general knowledge game. The main problem is there are very few cards and half of them are repeats leading to it being a dead game after 3 sessions.

O.K. game for a couple of rounds, then boring. Not a regular 'go to' for the game evening.

A good concept - but not always very well executed, and there aren't enough questions.

A simple but challenging trivia game. The trivia questions are usually not too hard hard, but finding the link between the answers often is.

Created the BGG entry for this one after I saw it on Dragons' Den. A fun trivia game.

RATING: 6.5
Good party game to play in teams, but the difficulty of the 'link' between the answers varies quite a lot.

It's a shame that one person has to be the 'question master'. We normally avoid this by taking turns to be that person, giving each team an alternating advantage unfortunately. But all players play all the time which makes it good for parties.

A fun trivia game where you don't have to know all the answers, just find the link between them! 
Useful for parties and the like.

Typical Christmas time game with lots of family and friends.  My main difficulty is remembering what to shout out when I have the link ... "Linkee!!" not some random grunt.

Trivia game.  I don't generally like trivia games, but this one is actually pretty interesting in that you are rewarded not necessarily for your knowledge of obscure facts, but for your ability to see the links between different concepts.  The scoring is a little bit wonky, but it's fun if you're looking to pass the time.

The two stage nature of the questions and answers is a brilliant idea. It allows the questions to lean on simple and obvious while still making you feel clever when you pick up the common thread.

Nothing to elevate this above other trivia games, and of course my failure to watch TV for decades puts me out of the loop on a lot of the references.

This is an interesting trivia game in which the answers to four questions form the clues for the final answer.  The questions aren't so tough.  The competition is more in jumping to answer the final question early before you hear all of the clues.  It's quicker than many other trivia games, so if you'd like to do really easy trivia without spending a lot of time, this can be fun.

Not a bad game. Definitely has a few references that I didn't follow. Couple of pop culture stuff that isn't something that everyone would know. Aside from that, still a pretty fun game.

If parts of the answer come up in one of the questions (Star Wars and SW Clone Wars), it's not a good quizz game. Also, sometime the categories weren't distinct. Some of the questions weren't even distinct. And don't get me started about the rules about having to form the game title out of the cards you win and spending two cards to take cards away from other teams. We left those out from the start, still very frustrating if the cards and questions aren't designed well.

A fun trivia game that has a little twist where you are trying to guess the link between the answers and not the questions themselves.

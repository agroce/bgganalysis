RANK: 2308

RATING: N/A
Happy to have collected a good load of minis. But nowhere near complete sets. The game is good enough on its own and with the versatility for other games like Heroscape or the adventure systems, thye will certainly get used. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Well, that was disappointing.  I guess there was no theme, or reason for the battle.  Felt like my minis wanted to fight the opponents minis for the hell of it.  Might be better with a lot more minis (we had a starter box each) but I'm not particularly itching to spend the money and find out.

Sold the starter set.

Overly fiddly rules yet a disappointingly simplistic combat system. Where are all the normal D&D monsters? I want orcs, goblins, elves, dragons, etc.

Great skirmish game. Sculpts and paint jobs are getting better with each set.

The collectability, warband building and skirmishes are absolutely fantastic. This is a great game for anyone that enjoys D&D, but would like to step away from the RPG aspect and focus on combat.

It was fun, but the rules seemed a little clunky.  Would be good for a good light miniatures game (since you don't have to do a lot lot of work to play).  What I've heard about 4th edition changes doesn't exactly make me excited, but I'll give it a try nonetheless.

Used more to play D&D than the mini game.
The mini game is okay, but I prefer the role play aspect.

I WANT YOUR MINIS.
Mostly looking for "common monsters" which are not necessarily common.  Like Beholders, Dragons, Gelatinous Cubes, Skeletons, Zombies, Gnolls... basically monsters you'd need for a TYPICAL adventure.

Fast and very tactical skirmish miniatures game which uses a simplified D&D ruleset as its base. Miniatures are evocative and manageable, if you can get past the collectible issue.

If I could still play D&D these would be pretty cool and useful.  As it stands, I have a grip of them from the first and second series and have played with them some, and had some fun games, but nothing to make me really get hooked on this game at all.  Denis game me the Gargantuan Black Dragon for my 31st birthday this year, and that is just cool.

RATING: 3
I used to thoroughly enjoy collecting and playing this skirmish game. I find it has medium strategy levels and medium luck. It is collectable and always has the pitfalls of a game based on cash spent, and the resale value is only virtual. If you never sell it, it isn't worth anything. I have stopped playing the miniatures game, but I like to keep the minis for roleplaying occurrances. I don't think the game is bad, but it's likely I'll never play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another great game that gets distilled down to a science when building warbands.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Beautiful miniatures. But the system, which is a reasonable approximation of D&D's own battle system is just too random to make a pure symmetrical tactical battle interesting.

Treat this one as not-too-pricey miniatures that come with a game attached. :)

It's a simple little miniatures game. I collected the figures for use in regular roleplaying games, and after two years played the skirmish game - and it's not bad! Could use some better choose-the-terrain rules but then what miniatures game could not?

I sold all of these minis I had collected for a little profit actually.  I had full sets from Harbinger up to through Night Below.  Never bought any Desert of Desolation.  I sold them all to Troll n Toad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I hated it.  I felt the rules had a bizarre mix of some things that were too detailed and some things not detailed enough.  Most of my problems were the result of the 'squares' on the board and the wonky corner to corner los/cover rules.  The figs are fine and present a consistent look on the table,and that prevents me from going to a '1'.  I'd rather play Mageknight, and I hate Mageknight.  I'm also not a GW fan, but I think Mordheim better represents the same style 'warband' play.

I have lots of commons and uncommons from the various sets. These are pretty well done and cheap (if you avoid the rares). I use them for other games as well.

RATING: 6
This would be more interesting as a true minis game, without the grid map.  The range, movement, and quirky line-of-sight rules seem forced on a system that would be better off with templates.  Otherwise it's a CCG where locational position matters.

RATING: 8
I'm rating the miniatures themselves, here, not the game.  Kind of misleading to list some of these more "crossover" games on BGG.  I do actually use these minis in play (D&D) along with my mini mat.  True, it would be nice if they weren't packaged in the collectible format, but I've still managed to acquire lots of what I need.  No painting time, and I don't feel bad if they get trashed.  For an RPG I think they can add another dimension of play.  For a miniatures game, I would play something else... like Confrontation or Mordheim.  UPDATE:  If I get one more Nightcrawler from "Giants of Legend" I'm going to just go on ebay and buy the precise miniature I want!!!  Uh, wait, no I'm not, I'm still a stupid rube and I'll gamble with buying yet more packs.  UPDATE:  Wow, the more recent packs (War of the Dragon Queen and War Drums) really stepped it up in terms of quality and blending in some monsters I was really after.  I'm still not too keen on the collectible aspect, but these sure are nice for using in D&D games.  I think collectible miniatures games are probably the future in the collectible games market.  They're just so much more versatile than the CCGs.

What can I say, I loved this Miniature Skirmish game.
I really liked putting teams together and seeing how well they did.
In fact, this was one of my favorite Skirmish games.
I also could use the mini's in a variety of different games.
Just a whole lot of awesome all around.

RATING: 8
The models are great, I just think the Starter Set is lacking in that is could have more damage counters and an extra D20. The starter is really only made for one player. Also, the rules are a sticky point and after a few games we still havn't figured it out and people just get angry, but the game is nice and diverse. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game is a conflict in my soul...Fun, quick miniatures system but it's collectible and therefore inherently evil. It's basically D&D without the roleplaying, which is fine by me since I don't really have the time or drive to invest in RPGing these days.  Fun miniatures, fun warband building, and overall fun rules.  Would rate higher, but the collectible issue is tremendously terrible as some figures are clearly worthless in skirmish although useful for use in the RPG- WotC is selling two products to you here.  I do not play the RPG, so I have useless figures.  Therefore, I'm strictly trading or buying singles from now on.  Lawful good rocks!

Have a heap for role-playing. Haven't played the skirmish game version. They're usually good quality plastic minis. Hate that it's collectible.

RATING: 9
My favorite game from 2005 until 2012.  Lack of support from Wizards has me moving on to other games.

I was so addicted to this game (1,000   minis).  I love the artwork and the strategy of warband building.  

The only reason for not ranking this a 10 is the investment required to play from purchasing additional boosters.

The game is more balanced now than ever with no one killer warband.  I know others may not agree but this one is my favorite

Good. I really liked this when it first came out, and spent way too much money on it.  Unfortunately, like all C*Gs, it requires a pool of locals to play with.  I moved and didn't feel like seeking out new players.  As a game, it's not bad, but kind of all over the place.  I'd like it better if it used 2d10 instead of 1d20 (to pull the results closer to the middle), but it has that delicious, kooky D&D flavor for the nostalgia angle.

One of the better collectible miniatures games.  A simple and elegant battle system that replicates D&D 3rd Edition more than makes up for the drag of keeping up with each mini's hit points.

Got a starter with my Dreamblade demo package. Browsed through the rules, and so far its an "okay". I have played a LOT of D&D in my time and this would have seriously caused massive budget problems if it'd come out when I was still actively playing D&D. The fact that you can use the game both for D&D and for a collectible miniature game bothers me somehow, although I cannot really explain why... :) 

Update: after a few plays, I am quite happy to announce I will not be playing D&D Mini's! :) As I expected, the rules are too fiddly and the personal appeal to me isnt that big. Lucky me, I really didnt want to get into another collectible game... 

Update 2: Damn! Played another game with my girlfriend and it totally rocked! I really dont need another collectible game in my collection!

RATING: 10
I rate this as D&D ( the RPG ).

This is for me the top game. 

As a player: Assuming the DM is good, or at least medium: The game changes from time to time, millions of possibilities and strategies, and it's very intresting to act like the charecter you made.

As a DM: I love writing stories and inventing games, I do those a lot, and as a DM I do both.

Wow!  All these great miniatures (my weakness) but too much to absorb for an older gamer!  I go to play with some guys that have played this for years and just frustrate them since I don't know all of the best characteristics and ways to build a unit...or to use it once it's built!  I may never take the time or have the time to do what they do, so I'll try and play with other novices at this wonderful CONCEPT of a D&D skirmish game!

Started fun as a skirmish game.  We enjoyed it in our group for nearly a year.  Got to be a hassle to store and sort figs and cards, so I've given up anything collectible anymore.

Quite good skirmish game and the minis keep getting better. Worth repainting if you can and very affordable at Ebay. But I decided to get back to Warhammer. So I sold it.

One of the games I played the most. Has lots of variety anfd replayalibity. It is easy to learn as you don't have to learn all the abilities of the game, just the ones your warband got. In the beginning the game used tiles with added even more variety to the scenarios. Later they included more balanced pre-made maps. Very expensive to get all the miniatures or at least the best miniatures to form a warband.

Nice enough, but I have a thing against suddenly having to play a table-top minis game in the middle of an RPG session.  It yanks the players out of the consensual dream-state of group storytelling and forces them to move little bits of plastic around on the coffee table.

Theater of the mind, baby, theater of the mind!

And, worst of all, using minis really hampers the DM's "fudge perogative"—you know, where you said you were behind the barricade, hiding, and yet a kobold managed to sneak up on you anyhow...  Just my 2 gp.

PS.  The collectible aspect blows double-plus hard.  For the love of baking soda just sell them in sets ala [i]Heroscape[/i].

UPDATE:  The new (2006) version of this game is pretty fun.  The double-sided full-color maps are gorgeous and immersive; the stat cards are now cleaned up and color-coded; even the minis have slicker paint-jobs.  The rules have been tweaked to make it easier to put together a team (read: you don't have to buy bucketloads of minis just to feel like you're able to play) and victory conditions have been opened up and spread out to afford at least two paths to a win.  (Kill the other team and/or occupy objective areas.)  A decent improvement over the old version, but still really only viable if you're into [i]D&D[/i].

Fun game for doing small skirmish style battles, but the Epic style mass battles require one to have a crapload of money and patience.
Boosters are a pretty good deal (the best I'd say out of all the Wizards games)- but not really what I was looking for (a system to do mass fantasy battles)

[b]RPG’S GOING WARGAME? I THINK THIS JUST MIGHT WORK! [/b]

First of all, I’m not an RPG geek. I’ve only played a few RPGs and each one of them a very few times, except for Exalted, which I actually like a lot and play a lot with a couple of friends. But the thing is, I don’t play lots and lots and friggin’ lots of RPGs because I hate three things about RPGs: 1.) Playing them requires a lot of time and energy, especially if you’re the Game Master and I really enjoy my social life and physical activities; 2.) I despise the RPG (and LARP too, for that matter) dorks who think for some adolescent reason, that they can without any sort of problem live the life they never had (And that’s actually slipping out like water from their fingers) through a piece of paper with numbers and lines; And 3.) I hate the (mostly) RPG-related lifestyle of wearing black or dark tones all the time, living an unhealthy life and succeeding on being the most gross-looking, foul-smelling human beings around. THERE! I SAID IT! WREAK HAVOC AND LET SLIP THE DOGS OF WAR!

With all that being said, it could be expected from me to keep away from all RPG-related things. But after learning that under the proper circumstances, some RPGs employ miniatures in their games, I could not resist the urge of getting my hands on those, if only to see if they’re interesting and worth painting. Imagine my surprise when I found out playing with them didn’t mean me getting into any make-believe game with other weird looking beings.

So what’s so good about this game? First of all, the control behind it and the subtle rules about ranging and movement and line of sight is something worth noting, especially for those gamers who have never played traditional tabletop wargames (I have played those and I still think the D&D miniatures games are cool and fun). Second, the quality of the miniatures themselves is impressive, but it could still be better in my opinion. They’re beautiful and every fantasy fan’s fantasy (Derp!), especially the beasts and elementals. However, the quality of the “paper boards” is at best lousy and need usually some sort of support, which could mean losing the other face of the paper, favoring a certain scenario over the other. Touching and handling paper too much hopelessly ends up in some tearing and wear.

The game opens the door for the players’ ideas on scenarios, winning conditions and a ton of house rules for certain characters, plus, adding new character rules and specifications is not impossible, unless they’re not properly play tested. These games are versatile at worst and amazingly complex and rewarding for those with a not too deep pocket. Wargame at its best and hey! You can prime them up and paint them all over again!

Abstract [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Themed: Even though the game is completely set in the Dungeons & Dragons’ universe, I can’t help thinking the core mechanics and other certain elements could be very well adapted to other environments and situations. Maybe not historical games, but certainly alternative history or other fantasy of sci-fi settings..

Simple [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Complex: It could be deceiving the real amount of tactics one character could have, especially when playing with other creatures and/or allies. If this game is any like other worthy wargames out there, it will all be about cooperation and good team work, compensating deficiencies, and outsmarting the enemy. I just haven’t found it… yet.

Strategic [b]______[COLOR=#FF0000][6][/COLOR]____[/b] Tactical: Due to the amount of space available, the quantity of creatures and allies, the endless combinations and the obvious restraints applicable to the players and their armies, thinking strategically could not reap many benefits, but still, having a certain goal works just as well, even if it is killing all the bad guys before they kill all of your guys. 
 
Luck [b]__[COLOR=#FF0000][3][/COLOR]_______[/b] Skill: Rolling a d20 is never a matter of skills. You could have some advantage for some rolls, but that’s not usually the case…

Fiddly [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Elegant: Rules are simple and very straight forward. Mostly, players should have an eye out with the ranging and line of sight rules which could prove to be tricky on some angles of attack and structures. Fortunately, most of the rules could be easily understood and applied with logic and a healthy amount of imagination and ubiquity.
 
Indirect interaction [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Direct interaction: Dude, it’s a wargame with awesome creatures and powerful individuals...

Cutthroat [b]____[COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] Friendly: Setting some goals for different scenarios could prove to be an interesting twist and it might serve well the idea that after all, this IS an RPG-based game. Not everything is about showing off your weapons and muscles, brains are important too and politeness and diplomacy should always be considered when looking for a solution.

Heavy use of language [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] No language needed: There’s a lot of text in the character cards and learning how to read them and apply them is also a very important part of the game. Not suitable for the short-tempered or the impossible to calm down after they’ve taken a hit.

[b][i]III. Number of players recommended[/i][/b]: 2.

[b]Favorite game of 2003[/b]

:thumbsup: customizeable

:thumbsdown: dice-based combat resolution [url=http://archive.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/miw/20060406b](Probably why my favorite warband utilized 4x Githzerai Monk)[/url]

:thumbsdown: fiddly line of site determination

Overly complex rules(flanking, morale, command), non-interactive output randomness of rolling a D20 as a combat resolution mechanism, and the fiddly-ness of determining line of sight and/or cover, but I inexplicably enjoy this game.

Sadly, it died under the weight of it's own Skinnerian distribution model, complexity, and fracturing their own playerbase by switching the game rules from 3rd to 4th edition.

The game is somewhat wanting.  The figures are great, and work well for converting to other games.  Three-dimensional terrain and a non-blind format would have made this game much better.  If I were rating just the game I'd give this a 3....add 1.5 for the nice figures.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (Pre 2010)

I remember I liked this game a lot!!! My brother was number one in our country for a long time. The miniatures are awesome, but the problem was that at the time Magic: The Gathering was my entire game world so I didn’t buy any box for the game. It was the first miniature game I ever saw. It has a lot of luck but you can mitigate it somewhat with your tactics. A very good tactical game, it’s a shame it was so expensive to buy all the miniatures. I would love to play this again, but as of right now I prefer Heroscape.

I used to play a lot of D&D, so this is a good "fix" for me without having to actually play a long game of D&D. I was always more into tactics than role-playing anyway. The figures and paint jobs are not as nice as others on the market. The rules are a simple transition for someone with a D&D background. You get all of the cool D&D archtypes in both monsters and "adventurers." Secret warband construction is fun in the same way as deck construction, and I'm into that sort of thing. (Even if I never did go too far down the path of the CCG money pits.) To top it off, I have a nice moderate collection of the Dwarven Forge 3-D dungeons so overall it looks great. I like it; it is D&D without the cheese.

Yes, it's collectible. I know that sucks, but at least you still get prepainted minis that you can use for your RPG's forever (as opposed to thousands of worthless cards that will rot in your attic for the next 50 years). Plus, the game itself is a great combination of classic D&D monsters and heroes with the patented WOTC collectible game excitement and metagame piled on top. Unquestionably, this is one of my favorite games.

Represent characters and monster in the D&D roleplaying game. Played using the competitive D&D skirmish rules in the Entry Pack (4.0). The skirmish rules allow players to compete in a warbands fight. Winner is the player whose warband eliminates enemy creatures equal to its own cost. There are also various other victory conditions.

Play tested game on April 1/05, and many time since then. Would like to have...but find collection expensive, and member in play group collects.

I was so excited when these came out.  I wanted cheap pre-painted miniatures for RPGs.  The collectable/rarity aspect just killed this for me.  If I need some orcs, I want to be able to buy orcs.

I'm using dreamblade figures for the large critters that are too expensive to justify buying.

My gaming friends are into this big time, but IMHO, the rules, which are a somewhat streamlined version of the RPG's combat system, are WAY too fiddly to make for an enjoyable game, even by the standards of miniatures games.

DDM was the best of the collectible miniatures games. Top tier tournament lists had a ton of variety not seen in any other CMG due to great design and point costing by the game designers.

I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will likely never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

I love the miniatures themselves: they offer a great middle ground between unpainted minis and actually doing the work to paint mental minis (which I'm terrible at and don't really enjoy, with the exception of classic BattleTech).

The skirmish game itself, while fun overall, never quite grabbed me. On the one hand, the rules are sound (lean and light while presenting lots of options), it's enjoyable to play, and you can have a surprising amount of fun (for a CMG) with just a starter and a booster or two.

On the other hand, to get maximum enjoyment out of it, you need a sizable collection -- because alongside strategy, army building is the real fun of the game. So, like lots of other games, it's really the collectible aspect that bugs me. Based on gameplay alone, I'd give this a 7; being a CMG I never plan to play again drags it down to a 5 for me.

I've only played this with the Harbinger starter pack but I found it to be lacking.  The collectibility turned me off of it.  I like the D&D realm of things but I could think of ten other skirmish games I'd rather play.  Still, I have acquired a lot of the plastic minis for rpg and other skirmish game use.  Maybe one day they will ditch the CMG angle.  Many commons can be had for under 1$ and while they may be lacking in some sculpt quality and paint job they make up for it in convenience and durability.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a team is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

D&D Miniatures is a load of fun - but only if you invest a LOAD of cash. Budget conscious gamers should stay clear.  

However, the game is good.  It's fun creating warbands and pitting them against your opponent.  The combat system is simple but slightly more detailed than the Star Wars Miniatures Batte game.  The unique abilities of the many models keeps things interesting and replayable.   

UPDATE: Nov 2011 - starting first D&D campaign since the 1980's so these will come in handy.

Decent quality pre-painted miniatures were a huge selling point on this one for me, and I was very rarely disappointed, just from the aesthetic standpoint. The rules are simple, even if some of the special powers and effects are a bit too fiddly. Still, that's what you should expect coming from D&D! Nothing special really considering all the other CMGs out there, but it's good fun when you're in the mood for fantasy.

This is the game that turned me off of collectible tactical miniatures games, ugh. I got the minis for playing D&D, and I wanted to like the D&D Miniatures game. It was passable, but it never really felt like a good game: Too complex for what it accomplished, and the battles were never very thematic, just a random mishmash of monsters. Given the complexity of the game, it'd be hard to talk me into playing this again instead of Star Wars Miniatures.

I had fun with this game during the first couple of sets. Figures were pretty evenly matched using the point system, and I usually broke some of the alignment rules in order to play more "themed" armies. In the end I stopped playing the miniature game itself, and just started using the miniatures during standard AD&D games for characters that players would run into.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fair adaptation of the RPG to tabletop gaming.  Miniatures are variable in quality but generally pretty good.  Collectible nature of the game is a drawback.  Revalued rating after release of March 2006 War Drums.  Rules are much more streamlined and accessible to casual players.

So my friend and I decided to get back in to D&D.  We haven't played since the 2nd Ed., so we were very interested in this 4E play.

We naively thought that this D&D Minis game would be, more or less, a direct port of the D&D RPG.  We were wrong.

Well, we were wrong in so far as the stat cards and combat are incredibly simplified in comparison to the D&D 4E Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and Dungeon Master's guide.

We actually played a few skirmish matches with a starter set that had a young green dragon, a lizard person, and 3 humaniod heros.  Some fun was had.

WoTC have done something clever here - they've been able to take the foundation of D&D and turn it into a minis collection game.  With that said, you don't need these minis to enjoy a game of 4E D&D, but we all know that we're suckers for chrome, and this fills that gap nicely.

So.. Minis gameplay with minis rules = OK.  I'm more interested in getting a proper mini for my main D&D RPG character, but these are good for encounters.  I'll avoid buying booster sets and focus on getting the minis that I want.

Thousands of different warband combinations to create. Figures from the wonderful world of D&D. One of the cheaper miniature games. Tons of fun. Great maps, good support from the company. One of my favorite games.

Started collecting these on a whim when I came across a couple of boxes that were clearly heavier than the others. It's been years since I have played D&D and I  didn't know anybody else that played. Just found out that one of my friends had just done the exact same thing, so now I do have someone to play and trade with.

After only one play, which was used to understand some of the rules, I do like the game, but I think I would like it better with different scenarios.

this is a pretty fun miniatures game. it's a little deeper than heroscape, but much lighter than regular dnd. it's about halfway in complexity between those two poles. the rules, admittedly, are a little wonky. i have no idea what the justification is in restricting warbands to identical alignment is. also, the route rule seems to further limit what bands are competitive. seems like a silly add on to make the game more palatable, or manageable for tournaments. as far as i can tell, tournament play consists of lots of the same warbands/figures, because of the balance issues that these rules create. i suggest a house rule that lets players choose warbands with the same alignment restrictions as regular dnd. (i'm not sure why there aren't any proper neutral factions.) otherwise this is a decent enough way to scratch that dnd itch if you're strapped for time.

I like this game quite a bit. Easily adaptable and relatively cheap to collect. I got a bunch of uncommons and commons on Ebay for next to nothing (combined shipping is your friend). TSR has made quite a few stabs at this genre, and if you ask me, they finally got it right.

Great way to get to the heat of battle quickly without the role playing.  Also great to use when role playing.  It is my favorite miniatures game because it works on a system, the d20, that everyone already knows.  The game is extremely easy to learn.  Plus, the dragons are just too cool.

The publisher has finally given up on this game (which relied on selling boxes of randomized miniatures on the CCG model). I've bought the miniatures mostly for playing D&D, but we've played the miniatures game too a few times; it's a pleasant enough tactical battle game with a fantasy theme.

As a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, I really wanted to love this. The minis are great because they are pre-painted and can be very cheap to buy, so thats a plus. Unfortunately, I didn't like the 20 sided dice rolling for this type of game - really it doesnt make much sense to me that there should be such an enormous variance in each action rolled for: form 1 to 20? nyah - unnecessary. That always bothered me about Dungeons and Dragons too, but there is so much else going on in role playing that I suppose this just becomes a quibble. I also didn't really enjoy the command structure of the game much. All in all, i believe other mini games to have better systems, such as the Confrontation third edition system by Rackham. Of course, I use the minis for many other games and systems though, so I will always purchase them - they are just really cool...

Intense!  I am a big fan of D&D.  Been playing since 1980 and it is my all time favorite game (hands down)!  Having said that, I have played "Casle Ravenloft" and could not stand it.  It might be a good game but not after having played the real thing.  

Now the minis skirmish game is (on the other hand) quite a bit of fun.  I know that it has died out but I would have to highly recommend it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
There are not many minis games whose expansions I look forward to as much as DDM - or which I have bought sight unseen by the caseload.  DDM would be the exeception.

Of course, my primary purpose for collecting DDMs is not for use in the D&D Minis game per se, but for use with D&D 3.5.   But for all that, the quality of these figures has utterly sold me. Our gaming circle had (and still has) about 1000 lead and pewter figs - hundreds of them painted. And we now no longer use them.

DDMs pre-patined minis are serviceables, good quality, and never damage during play.  

While the early Harbinger set's quality was questionable, the last five or six sets have for the most part been the best quality minis in the market - by far.

Figures are so beautiful but the game play is uninspiring. Also, every game there are so many rules questions! But I guess that's to be expected when each new figure's power has the potential to interact/negate/double/reorder, etc. the power of every other figure. It's the same problem I run into with card-based games; each card's potential interaction with all the other cards is rarely covered in the rules.

I have hundreds of cards available for trade/purchase. I don't want to get rid of them piecemeal but would like to get rid of them as a whole batch.

A great miniatures game.  Especially if you're a big fan of fantasy, which I most certainly am.  Unfortunately, a number of the more recent minis available seriously outclass what's come before, which is really annoying, but, even so, it's still a lot more balanced than most of the other CMGs that are out there.

And there's a huge variety of different miniatures available for it on the secondary market.  Do you like the "traditional" fantasy of Tolkien's Middle Earth and the standard D&D setting?  Well then, make a warband of elven archers and rangers along with their giant eagle allies and take them up against a Dragon and her orc and goblin followers.  Or would you prefer a more steampunkish feel?  Then play a warband of Warforged, magically powered "robots" from the Eberron setting.  Like I said, there's a huge variety from which to pick.  And the fact that they can all be used in the roleplaying game as well makes them doubly useful, which is exactly what the company was aiming for.

(Just to be clear, I'm referring to WotC's first edition of this game, NOT the 2.0 "simplified and streamlined into crap" second edition they're currently switching it over to.)

RATING: 5
A two player skirmish game using a simplified version of the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition combat rules. It's not a bad game, but for some reason it comes off as a bit dull. The Star Was Miniatures game uses nearly the same system, yet that game feels epic and exciting whereas this one stale and repetitive. I think the problem lies in the setting. Playing Star Wars, firefights with blasters are just as dangerous as close in fights with lightsabers. In the D&D game, range weapons are like pin-pricks compared to the various melee attacks, so almost every battle devolves into a big clump of guys in the middle of the board trying to score flanking bonuses. It's just very uninspiring.

I'll probably never play the actual game that these miniatures were crafted for again. I just use the figures now to flesh out my Dungeons & Dragons experiences.

The figures are very well sculpted and painted, IMO, some amazingly so; [i]Large Red Dragon, Chuul, Earth Titan, Brass Idol, Owlbear Rager, Large Ice Elemental, War troll, Ravenous Ghoul, and Feral Troll[/i] spring to mind.
Yes, the figures are randomly distributed in blind packaging, with sucky rarity. This we all know.

Solution: buy the figures you need seperately on eBay; which is cheaper in the long run and avoids surplus miniatures filling your conservatory, etc. Anyhow, most of the critters you'll need to run a blindingly good dungeon-bash are commonish, mostly.

I have a fairly large collection of D&D minis. I've never played the game though - I just have them for roleplaying.

The non-randomized 2008 starter set is and excellent value with a d20, two combat maps and 5 models for $14.

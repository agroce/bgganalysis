Beta tested this game and it's unlike any other that I have played to date, I really liked the concept, but it seemed much to easy to make the company successful.  We were able to fund all aspects of the game with more than enough money after round 3, the dice rolls were definitely in our favor.  I think I may want to try this one again, but it may be difficult since the game took the 4 of us about 3 hours to complete.  If I'm going to spend 3 hours on a game, it will be one that is a bit more challenging.

** DISCLAIMER: I was a playtester. **

A shared incentive (*not* a semi-coop) game that, when it shines, spans the boundaries between boardgame and social RPG. The best games of this will be less about the board and you doing actions than the crevices surrounding those actions and what leverage you can extract or how you push your fellow players. It's a sandbox-y game in that whether your company fails, deregulates, is a wild success, needs a bailout, opens China, or favors good shipment will vary between games and in many ways is group and scenario dependent. Stridently *not* for everyone and incredibly group dependent. High control gamers in particular will feel uncomfortable with it (although, like most SMG titles; the person who plays the most skillful game is most likely to win), but for those that enjoy a healthy dose of negotiation in their games, give it a solid look.

You roll dice, you roll a bunch of dice actually, but that's not the point. Risk mitigation is the name of the game. The actions are otherwise sort of on-rails with limited player agency; *outside of leverage*, you are proscribed to do many actions to the fullest, and actions you can choose whether to do are dictated by dice rolls (with your input being risk aversion/expenditure), and the chaos induced by the end of round events where the elephant moves (by far, the largest drag on the game and the one thing I wish had been developed out). That's not the point though. Where Chicago Express uses implicit negotiation through actions to communicate and make partnerships, communication by wink and nod, John Company uses a megaphone and artillery. Deals (and leverage) are open, brash, and fast in the same way that Bohnanza's open call auction/market is. This is the heart of the game; leverage and negotiation. John Company uses a similar leverage negotiation effect as Eklund's older Lords games or Bohnanza (e.g. the leverage structure of the card flipping and negotiation). Some absolutely magical moments of gaming (only rivaled by Bezier's ONUW or an SMG Pax game) have transpired out of John Company. Roll well and people needle each other to get ahead. Roll badly, and people straight up blame you which is hilarious in its absurdity, but does bring up one thing that I worry about; what's this like with people who you don't know and you can't rib on. The games I've played with unfamiliar groups have been board-line painful. At times, I don't think there is enough *game* present vs it being an experience (in the same way that I question the solo mode of BIOS:Genesis), especially if one is locked out of the company temporarily and will spend the next hour or so trying to pry their way back in. At other times, I don't care because it's wonderful at what it does.

There are two general situations that exist in the early/general/tournament scenario; the company is going well and you're trying to get ahead. Second, the company falls apart. This has a similar strategic feeling as Cole's earlier work An Infamous Traffic (or The King is Dead with Saxon invasion) does in so far as it's entirely possible for things to fail, and there are perfectly legitimate reasons for players to want either scenario to occur. That teetering between failure and success is an interesting dynamic. Sometimes folks come together for periods of time and it's cooperative (or "coopetition") and other times people needle each other to various degrees. For players to do well with this, learning to exploit the events in India (where the elephant moves, whats likely to happen, etc) is important and learning how to create leverage to utilize against other players. Understanding who is now interested in failure and who isn’t is a crux issue. 

The other scenarios are beasts and really give the game meat by which to chew on for a ton of plays. The campaign game is the base game on steroids. The deregulated company with firms turns into an 18xx-like game with shared ownership stocks, and takeovers bolted on top of the standard game. The John & Co "what if" scenario means regions can be bought or sold and formed into private areas via auction and all sorts of weirdness. The solo game is an odd wargame-ish experience while the others are all different. On top of that, the Bank of England ("1vMany" style) and low-luck die adjustment variants add a new twist on the standard games. Easily a solid 30+ games of content to really explore it from start to finish.

The time estimate is woefully low, the early/tournament scenario consistently runs almost 3 hours or more. The campaign game should realistically run around 5, but I've never attempted it. I can see how the standard game could be done in 90min, but I don't think it would be interesting or worth playing if you're not going to negotiate to the fullest… That actually brings out the one thing that makes me smile in a weird way, in that this is an SMG title. Much like Pax Porfiriana, it's a delicate title, with only niche appeal and is ***highly group dependent*** (I can't emphasize this enough). When it fires on all 8 cylinders though, it's amazing and unlike most other games. Demands a place in my collection, even if it only serves a very specific occasion or group.

Republic of Rome meets Greed, Inc. with a little 18xx thrown in, distilled down to a wonderful game. It's dripping with theme, tension, and an accurate representation of history. This game has everything I love about games, and everything I wish games would be. After 15 plays I still feel like I'm barely scratching the surface. I look forward to many, many more plays.

RATING: 4
Rating based on a demo at Essen.  This is the most obtuse game I have played in a long time.  It is clearly intended to be a negotiation game and yet the value of many things is hard to fathom. It seems a regression to earlier Sierra Madre designs where player control and options come second best to experiencing the history.  I can well believe that John Company improves with repeat plays.  However, it was so inaccessible at the first that it is unlikely ever to get more from me.

RATING: 3
we had high expectations for this one but after one unfinished game we probably will never play this again.
We played six players, mostly no one knew what to aim for and the game just slowly crawled around by itself. Some players had literally nothing to do, the only thing happening for them was the Family action.
Knowing the game really well and negotiating could have saved it but because we had no idea what to negotiate about and what the goals should be, there wasn't much negotiation involved.
Could have been better with 3 or 4 players when everybody would be more involved. Maybe. Hard to say

"Some see things as they are and say, 'why?'  Others dream things that never were and say, 'why not?'"  This title, like 1714: Case of the Catalans, is exclusive domain for the latter, those with the courage to play a game that challenges their very sense of being.  The trained chimps who beg for the safe haven of soulless little titles like Forged in Steel and Glory to Rome can forget about this one.

Still kicking the tires on this one but man oh man if ever there were a game calculated to stimulate my pleasure centers, it's this Republic of Rome/Genoa/Rolling Stock mashup.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I've been thinking about a game like this for almost a decade, and it's been a distinct pleasure seeing it come into being over the past year. 

Like my other designs, this game is not for everybody. It sits squarely on the boundary between political and economic games. In some sense it is a bit of a throwback. There are event tables and lots of dice rolling. But I think the game offers a fresh subject and approach that many will find worthwhile. Players have a lot of room to be creative in their strategies, and the game will tolerate functional and dysfunctional companies alike.

Really like the multiplayer and want to play a bunch of campaign games.
Solo game is..."meh".  Very dice dependent, but it flows pretty quickly so its not like you lose a lot of time.

Going to get to 10 solo plays and decide where it falls for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The rating is for the solo game only. My impression so far is that the multiplayer game is an 8 or 9, assuming the undoubtful fragility of the game does not become a problem.

 The solo game is an interesting way to learn the company-related mechanisms, leaving outside the huge family-related part of the design space, which is super interesting from an emerging gameplay point of view. I suspect that this is where most of the depth of the game eventually will be, so this hurts the solo experience quite a lot.

Otherwise, the main interest of the solo game revolves around learning to predict and game the elephant probabilistic walk system, which is a bit of a stroke of genius in its design, but not enough to keep the solo gamer engaged in the long run. Especially since the narrative of the solo game is not very strong either. 

I cannot recommend the solo game for repeat plays, but only for learning the ropes. Thanks to Cole for devising the solo variant, but for me, the meat of John Company lies in multiplayer, which I am looking forward to discover, assuming the game gets accepted in my groups.

An elegant game with considerable depth. A gamer's game, complex to play well, yet simple in it's mechanics and execution. Every game I play of this, makes me appreciate the design and gameplay more and more. It's really superb.

A nice balance of a huge sandbox that features competition and sense of working together with a strong economic focus, along with an easy-to-grasp history and brilliant theme that makes the game less "abstract" in execution than some of the other Pax titles. This is easily my favourite Sierra Madre game now that it has been published. A strong entry in the SMG line of games from designer Cole Wehrle. Really enthusiastically enjoyed play testing the game right from the start of the testing development stage of the design.

Gordon has nailed my exact feelings about the game so far, saying this ...

[q="patton55"]I've really only scratched the surface of this game so far. But for sure this is a very different feel than the Pax games (like Pax Pamir or the others). It's part 18xx stock stuff, part Pax _______, part Eurogame, part hybrid wargame, part.... I don't know how to explain it, you're closely working with other players to run a company where you want your own self in the best position to make the most money, but at the same time, you can't do it alone; you need to work with others as well. Overall, so far, so good. I'm liking it a lot.[/q]

My wife is disturbingly good at this.

She tanked the company, got all our Executives fired, and allowed my Senior officers to take over. They had no chance to save the company, so they ended up taking the blame for the eventual failure on the next turn, 5 VP to -9 VP.

I love Republic of Rome, but it's not terribly practical given the game length. This is a sub-2 hour Republic of Rome (full campaign may well be 3 or 4 hours), centred around an economic engine. It's also a surprisingly accurate simulation of the East India Company - even a casual glance at Wikipedia will find scenarios that can be replicated in the game.

The asymmetry of positions within a given turn drives the negotiation engine rather splendidly, and the promise cube system is an elegant way to have an easily-exchanged currency. The randomness is core to the simulation, and never really seems bothersome. "Rolling to score" is a bit suspect, but ultimately you're scoring with funds - which are totally under your control - so you're waiting for an opportunity to cash out. It's possible to roll badly, but it's very unlikely. Forcing the company into a Bail out to give you a chance to score is also always an option, so I think I'm pretty happy with where this ended up.

First impression after only one playthrough with 4 players

It is not that the game crashed. It failed to start. There doesn't seem to be any built-in system to incite players to keep the company in working order. And in fact it seems that it is quite the contrary. It led to a long frustrating experience. The scores at the end game ranged from 6 to -3. Some laughing occured (as fits of vented frustration) but that was not fun. At all.
 
I had high expectations, looking forward to enjoy something of the flavor of Republic of Rome, with a double/triple economy of company money, family money and "honor" debts (i.e. promises). What a violent and cruel disapointment. 

I  am willing to figure out why it felt so incredibly bad, what we did wrong. We had a clear problem to establish negociations. Probably less than 10 cubes were exchanged (???!!!??!?). People were "on edge".  We were very, very unlucky with the dice throws. We did play with india events while the rules clearly state that you should not use them in your first game (DO NOT USE THEM). 

Unfortunately, I may not find the occasion to give it another try as all around the table had such a bad time that they are unwilling to play again (uncluding the game owner).

I honestly think this game is terrible and I have no idea why it's getting praise.  John Company is long and complicated, but scoring largely comes down to rolling a die, which you can't manipulate, and hoping you get a 5 or 6.  Seriously?  Who thought that was a good idea?

Interesting, very thematic and fun game, which captures its subject well. I love the negotiation and scramble for positions.

But man, the game is long. In our first attempt at the short 6-round game, we only managed half a game in an evening. Second attempt we managed to get through all 6 rounds, but it took almost 5 hours (and that's not including the 45 minutes rules explanation)!

Also, in the second game, I felt I had my position completely destroyed about half way into the game, when bad attrition die rolls removed all my family members from their positions in one turn (and I only had money for mediocre prizes). I don't mind randomness in my games, but this felt pretty harsh (particularly for a game of this length).

Halfway through reading the rules I realized this was a modern take on Republic of Rome. And indeed, the first game felt just like playing RoR back in university. The lovely tension of trying to run things for everyone's benefit vs. trying to skim a little off the side. The emergent and memorable stories being created by what is really some absurdly swingy randomness.

I don't know that this is actually a good game design. But the experience of playing it was everything I could have hope for in this style of game.

Repeated plays might boost this higher, had a great first play of it at SHUX. Semi co-op where players work together to run the British East India company, and thus negotiation is a central aspect of the game. You have to work together to manage the company but you want to make out a bit better than your opponents. Unique theme and mechanisms from the designer of Pax Pamir and the upcoming Root.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This was far more of a negotiation game than I initially thought it to be and with the fair bit of moving parts I tired quickly of the game, particularly when the office I took was largely ineffective and useless and the other means I tried was followed by others and did not provide any more options to make positive headway. This game literally kicked me in the balls each and every time hope presented itself - I have no need to experience the like again but might put myself through it with the right group. There's a lot of interesting parts to the game, but it was marred by game and player induced chaos. Perhaps I went in expecting too much; I certainly went in expecting a different game experience than I received. Sierra Madre games are always chaotic and fairly wide open when it comes to the experience of the game - this game has it in spades and you are seeking to work within that experience to make your way. I'd likely prefer some sort of player placement of unused worker cubes to start the game instead of the random roll which placed me in an untenable position. This is no 90 minute game unless you are well versed in the game.

Our first game was a hilarious series of disasters that doomed us all, and the company double bailed in five turns.  There are so many different event cards and even prizes that the direction the game follows could be all over the place.  The game looks good as well.  Really looking forward to my next adventure with this one...many thanks to Jeroen vdV for explaining this one!

[b]John Company[/b] (2017) designed by [person=35585][/person] (designer of Pax Pamir)

The last paragraph below has me salivating!

[i]Description from the publisher:
Over its 250-year history the British East India company grew to become one of the most influential commercial and political organizations in the world. Its profits catapulted the British Empire to global dominance and shaped the fate of some of the world’s great nations. But, its ascent was anything but easy. The Company was filled with diverging interests and struggled constantly at home and abroad.

John Company attempts to tell the story of the British East India Company from the inside out. Players will steer their dynasties through the company’s history, vying for position, power, and prestige. The goal of the game is simple: use the Company and the Company’s trade to secure your place in society back home. To this end you will guide your scions through their careers, exchanging favors for positions in London or plush colonial posts. Players will collectively control the Company, facing tough budgetary decisions and conflicting interests. Should a Governor conduct a campaign to expand company holdings or invest in his region’s infrastructure? Perhaps the honest tax revenues would be better diverted to expand his summer estate back home...

As the game continues, the Company may face open rebellion in India or outright failure as it grapples with increasingly bold attempts at regulation from the British government. It’s even possible that the Company’s trade monopoly will be revoked, leaving the players to form and operate their own trading firms. Each game offers a huge range of possibilities, informed chiefly by the decisions the players make. In addition, players can tailor their experience by using one of the three tournament scenarios that cover the Early, Mid, and Late company that can be played in about 90 minutes. The game also offers a full campaign game that will take players from 1720 to 1857 in an evening.

Taking its inspiration from Phil Eklund’s seminal Lords games, John Company offers Food Chain Magnate by way of Republic of Rome. And, with only sixty cards and a modest footprint, John Company is one of the most accessible SMG offerings to date.[/i]

Once you penetrate the extraordinarily opaque rules and start to understand into the flow of things John Company reveals itself to be a very tight and thoughtful semi-co-op negotiation game, not unlike Archipelago.  While I have serious hangups regarding the sheer amount of randomness in both gameplay and in scoring, I cannot deny that this is a good game.
Seriously though, I understand the designer's intentions, but 2-4 hours of extremely heavy gameplay is severely undermined by having almost zero player input on final scoring.

This rating reflects several solo plays, but no group plays, so take it with a grain of salt.  The language and terms made the initial entry a bit difficult, but after watching several videos and following along, I was able to pick up most of the game.  I'm not a fan of economic games or negotiation games, but I am interested enough in the history to work through it.  After one aborted game, I was ready to put it on the sell pile, but I'm warming to the game a bit with repeated exposure.  Not as engaging as Pax Pamir, and I don't see that appreciation changing.

Intriguing game, beautiful presentation. But too often the design initially is very opaque.  Once you get over the hump (and that's going to take some real effort) however, it's great. There is a LOT to explore here!

Better definitions would have helped (there is no Glossary). More examples of play are needed, too. An extended-example-of-play would have been best, but none is provided.

Randomness (dice rolls and events) are aptly applied, nicely filling in the Sierra Madre chaos theory (you can attempt to mitigate luck by increasing the amount of dice you roll - at a cost. Brilliant!) . There are multiple effective design-for-effect crossroads that I really appreciate.

Nice variety of scenarios (including solo) and notes. Great theme! Initial rating likely to go higher with more plays as our group is very excited about this game.

Like Pax Renaissance this one has started badly. Not really sure what to make of it. A game it is not.

RATING: 7
It's a game that really needs a group willing to commit to multiple plays to explore the space. I say that about all of Cole Wehrle's games, but this one is especially true. Working up to the Full Campaign is like a 6-7 play commitment... Early Company two or three times... Post Monopoly two or three times, then maybe launch into a two or three plays of the full campaign. And then... maybe then... you can actually start to get your arms around what this game has to offer.

But this is definitely not a game you can introduce to someone with the intention of playing it only once or twice, and then turn around and play it with a new group of people.

If you have a gaming group of 4-5 people who are enthusiastic about this, then I am very jealous.

It does have that core weakness of every negotiation game, though: the game is only as good as the least interested person at the table.

First impression notes (2 plays, three player). This may go down as the year John Company came out. I'm kind of stunned as I write this. Co-opetition is a sort of magical, and really difficult, design space. Something about the right incentives & tension between constructive vs destructive play is so tricky; the paranoic will pull down the game too soon or just because they can, zealous builders will exhaust themeselves running in circles and discovering there's no big mound of collected stuff at the end to quantify their effort. And I think John C plays riffs along both these lines with confidence. I think of Wallace's Emerald and Mark Harmen's recent work (Churchill & Pericles) also as exemplar of a type, tho in a very different mode, along with the whole Container thing of the table floating the economy while wondering if & when to pull it down. You can tell Cole found just how he wanted to draw those lines. Bam! This reeks of creative maturity.

The cross incentives are so rich & redolent of the Company's history - how to explain the amazing shiftings of India and surrounding places? Stunning. The roving elephant marker is a gesture toward 18xx, but here it means so much more, the strange willfulness of history unfolding, as it wanders to limn the playspace with the rise & fall of empires reshuffling lands around the company hanging on to exploit its chaotic trail. Or even, a moment of insight to guide history can arise, and is that ever cool. 

The tempo has a fascinating relation to very well coached introduction of random interjections by the game, both the elephants wander and the retirement vs failure die rolls. By well-coached, I don't mean Ecklund's heavy handed frying pan & meteor stuff. I mean something so right it's uncanny, the way players set the probabilities not just for themselves but for each other, how necessity entwines them.

And all of this is seeable. I doesn't hide the shenaigans behind a hopeful opacity. Even as you see it all, the multiplicities confound predictability but provide enough levers to tilt things your way. And then there's that it is a true player driven game, yet the game itself contributes its throwdowns, acts alive, forcing the paranoic players to again unite to solve a crisis (or let it through if they think the crisis can serve them, tho nothing is so fully controlled you can bully the gamestate). 

And every turn, the voting on a rule that radically changes the game! And how votes are based, not on shares or executive power, but the stiffs down in the dockyards! It adds a whole different valuation to the economic bottomfeeders who invest in the underlying machinations rather than the big economic strokes of the trade routes.

I think I could talk about this game all night trying to place what it does and how. Everything connects. Valuations of just about everything shift in unexpected ways. Little tinkerings in the start-up form the tools for sudden swipes later in the game. VP buy-outs have a Wallace-like cost/benefit micro-struggle, but here they're embedded in the gameflow rather than in strict phases.

 John Company is inspired. Man, go get this now.

And big tip: I never do this, but I watched Andy Mesa's movie on 2 turns. It really got me into the game properly, and with the dynamic overview the rules are excellent. I strongly recommend you watch it, he does a fantastic job and you'll just start playing. And as a side note, thanks Andy, it let me jump right in.

Pretty much an auto-buy based off of theme, mechanics and Pax Pamir/Infamous Traffic.  If it proves as good as it promises, John Company will pretty much cement Wehrle as a favoured designer.

Just scratching the surface of this one, but wow.  I love it.  Will be difficult to find a group to play this with to really make this shine, but it would be well worth the effort.  If I could get a dedicated group that wants to play this on a semi-regular basis, this could move up to a 10.

This was taught to me not all at once, but as the actions unfolded. It really put me in the mind of the roles, and I would highly recommend any teacher to take the same tack. Even days later, I'm thinking about the implications of my actions. And we didn't even finish the game!

It's a very interesting and intriguing game but needs the right group. If players refuse to negotiate a lot it's a bit dead inside. Also, die rolls determine a lot and can really screw you over.

It's very fun just watching the company work, which is good as sometimes you will get to do just that without any input from you whatsoever if the other players decide not to include you.

Play testing. Usually I would like to rate a game after three plays, but since this is play testing I'm going to hold off. Though based on my last play of the deregulated game, I put this at a minimum of an 8.

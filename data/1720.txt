RATING: 7
I like this game and being a RuneQuest player for a while, I like the whole back story and mythos as well.
The low-ish score is because the rules are less than clear - Avalon Hill didn't rewrite them - and can make the game difficult to get into. Having said that, where else can you fight Bats, Dragonewts and magicians?

RATING: 3
As a Runequest fan I really wanted to like this game but it just did not do anything for me. Game play was boring and boiled down to who recruited the best mage. The production value was low for an Avalon Hill game and the French version doesn't look like it improved much. Sword and Sorcery is a much better working of a fantasy valley boardgame depsite SPI's typical production methods.

I had the Avallon Hill version and have now the French one (better graphics).
A stunning fantasy game which also has a counterpart in RPG (Runequest and now HeroQuest). Almost every unit has special abilities but the game is smooth and fluid and the rules are clear. The diplomatic rules are also excellent. Plays very well solo. 
A mega campaign is possible if one links this one to Nomads Gods. 
Too bad the series was never finished (there should have been a total of 4 games).

RATING: 7
Unique combat system, huge number of special rules/units, 
and super-powerful abilities make this game a very difficult
one to strategize about. Seems like there would be many
playings before it became rote. On the downside, there is 
a high burden of keeping track of what all your units can
actually do, as well as where they are. The subtle differences
in the different types of combat, and special abilities
also tax the ability to play correctly, much less well.
Big luck factor built into the combat system adds risk
management to the mixture; you need to make good plans,
but they may not hold up.

If you love Glorantha, this is a must own. If you like 
a powerful puzzle, and don't mind the burdens, this is also
a good choice (maybe better than anything else out there
in terms of figuring out the changing situation).

RATING: 5
I like the way magic is integrated into the combat mechanism, the board, some of the strange, mystical and quirky units.

I dislike the hundreds of counters and the stack-killing dragons and superheros who make pushing the hundreds of counters around feel slightly irrelevant. They make it a sort of nuclear alpha strike tit for tat.

Playtime is also a little too long for what it's delivering. Glorantha is as cool as fantasy settings get, though.

The game is full of colour and detail, with about 75% of the poorly written and confusing rules being pure chrome, but it plays more like World War II games such as Russian Campaign and Fortress Europa: stacks, ZOC's, compulsory combat and soak offs, air warfare and dive bombers (AKA spirit magic), defensive terrain and so on. Once the game commences the detailed lore becomes meaningless as units drop like flies in the tit for tat combat system that quickly clears the board and often produces drawn games (even when the tactical nuke-like and potentially game-breaking physical and chaotic magic is employed).

3 / 5 - Good

Basically an old fashioned hex and counter wargame buried under a ton of fantasy chrome. The gameplay is mediocre - a lot of it comes down to guessing which stacks are hiding dangerous units but the fantasy theme is evoked brilliantly. I have an immense nostalgic soft spot for this game because it's one of the introductions I had to the hobby.

One of the best boardgames ever (IMHO). It can take 3-5 hours to play the full game - I hardly have played the scenarios as the full game is so entertaining. Lots of possibilities for things happening, changing etc. Good strategic skill can get you out of pretty terrible situations but the obverse it true as well. It takes a good player to do well using any of the three major sides, but *any* of the three can win!

An old game, but for those old-school fantasy role players this is a great CoSim! The two parties - The Sartar vs. The Lunar Empire - are very different, so it matters a lot which side you are on. I love to play the Lunar Empire, which has a lot special units. The phases of the black moon let the power of the magicians rise and fall during the game, which is a tricky tactical detail to take into account.
This game might lack a few of the modern game mechanics, but I love it nevertheless.

Another all-time great game.  Source of my one and only knock-the-pieces-off-the-board-and-throw-the-board-on-the-ground arguments... I was 17 at the time, and my opponent did at least 50% of the the throwing.  In other words, there are a lot of units with special abilities, and it isn't always clear how those special abilities interact.  On the other hand, we were clearly into it or things wouldn't have gone so far.  The final straw as I recall had something to do with the Chaos Hound and Thanner Khan...

Upshot, with established house rules to deal with some of the rule ambiguities, this is a truly engaging game.  Highly recommended - but try not to throw anything at anyone.

Easily the best fantasy wargame ever, Dragon Pass is spectacularly rich in theming and strategic options.  It helps if you're familiar with the world of Glorantha (www.glorantha.com).

The most colorful, imaginative game setting ever. Shifting alliances, beautiful counters and map, I won't go on and on. I like the old Chaosium counters best. Played as a kid with what I imagine was a simplified version of the rules, mixed in with my own whims. I also used the blank counters to create other residents of Dragon Pass. 

I don't expect I'll ever have so much fun playing a game again, partly due to the age at which I played this one, and the inherent awesomeness of the game.

I have many happy memories of this awesome game.

A game so completely filled with epic theme, but stuck in 1970s game-design, that is is barely playable. Still, it is properly EPIC!

I own the new Oriflam version...Beautiful and one of the best games out there at differentiating combat in a fantasy world from historical combat.  Total luckfest centered on superhero save rolls, but so much fun it's hard to care--I'd love to see these basic ideas transported to a new combat system and area-based movement without losing its wonderful chrome.

This is one of the first boardgames I ever bought, back in the early 80's. I've never completed a game of it despite owning it for all these years, not for lack of trying back in my mid-teens. The box is in fairly poor shape but the game is otherwise intact.

[about La Guerre des Héros-French version]

Beware, this is a quite complex game. Basic rules are simple but many special cases arise due to the very rich background of Glorantha.

A must buy for Runequest fans.

     I loved this game when I was younger. I enjoyed this one a lot. Rules were broken down to add options through later scenarios to make the learning curve a little easier. Had a lot of different units and abbilities to use. Very cool design. I thought this one was done very well.

I would truly love to stumble on another copy of this at Goodwill. Can you say print & play? [i]Print & store, is more likely...[/i] I could use a good scan of the original rules, including the covers. Thanks!

The fantasy brilliance of Greg Stafford's mind is a wonderful game. It is very different than many traditional hex boardgames. It is magical.

The game that spawned Glorantha. I REALLY wanted to like it but the impenetrable rulebook made it hard. I found myself wanting it to end early. Bonus point for the background material though, and I have considered making my own rules for it.

Lots of Gloranthan flavor.  Interesting gameplay and factions.  Anyone with a passing interest in Glorantha will love this game, partly because there few boargames set in this world.  One problem, Jareel the Razoress and Harrek usually face one another in a sort of superpower standoff; one cant let them rampage thorough your forces.  Gamewise, they are probably too powerful...but, it is true to Gloranthan mythology.

Glorantha is so rich in immersive atmosphere. In many ways these layers of detail exceeds licensed worlds such as Tolkien and Lovecraft because it is fleshed out for more than just the path the characters took in those adventures. It is at its best when in a boardgame with lots of unit. Would love to see a modern treatment with less clunky rules.

Everyone else seems to think this update of White Bear Red Moon is better because it's more complex - I prefer the original! But it's still one of the best games around. I could do with a better map though, my Chaosium paper map is a bit worn.

EDIT: I decided I couldn't live without an AH copy - bought through eBay

Bought primarily for a better map than my old, worn Chaosium map. Have to say I prefer the older, more subtle, colours though!

This game is big if you are a fan of Chaosium, Greg Stafford, Glorantha, or Ducks!  RQ was my all time favorite RPG, and it all started here.  A great game by itself, but much more if ever played RQ.

If you are looking for a fantasy game that is a real wargame, this one is pretty good.  The game is a mixed bag:

Pros
1.  The scenarios do a great job of gradually introducing you to the rules and special units.
2.  The map is interesting with many features.
3.  Not only do you have the two main factions, but you also have all of the independent units and special units which make this game really cool.
4.  When you put everything together, this is one of the most detailed and richest fantasy wargames out there.
5.  I like real wargames (vs Ameritrash) and chrome and this is a nice change from all of the very simple fantasy battle games out there.

Cons
1.  Some of the superheroes and other units are crazy powerful and they just go around destroying stacks of figures.  Not really much anything in their way can do.
2.  I do not find the historical context of Glorantha all that interesting - I find several parts actually pretty dumb.
3.  The artwork on the counters is very basic and does not differentiate the units that much.  Modern artwork would greatly enhance this game.
4.  The rulebook is confusing in several aspects.  There are zero examples which does not help.
5.  The combat results table has huge swings in the losses inflicted depending on your die roll.  I personally would have preferred a 2d6 or 1d10 results table to even out the large jumps.

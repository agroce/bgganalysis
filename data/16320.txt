RATING: 7
Not the best of the Mystery Rummy series (I really like the series) but a good one, and easy to teach.  There is some tension based on whether or not to lay a meld, or wait until the car is in place to double the points.  There may be a slight bias towards lower value cards, because of where the car starts on the track.

A logical, but not much fun, card game with simple gameplay despite a terrible rule book. Awful graphic design really kills the package, but there is a half decent game in here somewhere.

A nice twist on the standard rummy games.  This is the first of the Mystery Rummy games I have played, and I am pretty impressed.  This game scales well on players, and has very little down time, as it plays very quickly.  I find it to be very luck based on some games, where the starting hand can deliver the hand to a certain player, but since you play a few hands before a winner emerges, it settles out a little in the averages.

RATING: 8
Along with Wyatt Earp it's my favourite of the Mystery Rummy series of games. 

The artwork is also good for a Mystery Rummy game the only real complaint being the spelling and grammar mistakes on the board. 

To speed up play it's essential to create your own markers to put on the board when someone has melded a number. It allows the players to easily see which numbers have been melded rather than look around the table at cards that are quite similar looking. 

Probably best as a two player game although three is perfectly playable. I wouldn't recommend it with more than three though.

RATING: 5
Rating is based on just a few plays, but if anything it might go higher. I really like the multiple options you have every hand, and the Ted Hinton card, which offers three different choices, is quite helpful. Then there is the car, which you hope to manipulate to locate Bonnie or Clyde.

Update: after 5-6 plays I dropped it from an 8 to a 7. The graphics are so frustrating: you can hardly tell which melds have been played by the player across from you. It's a new game and it already it needs player aids. That's not a good sign.

RATING: 6
Whereas I felt that there was a good bit of distortion with Jack the Ripper from Standard Rummy games here the differences (hidden card behind locations, manipulation of car and 1 special action card) do not for my mind do enough to make this more interesting than standard rummy as you lose the two ways of playing cards (runs and x of a kind) with this format.  Still a fun rummy variant and a small amount of theme comes across but I like this less than either Alcatraz or Jack the Ripper.  Criticisms of the components are overstated  - they are fine and perfectly useable but in a game that is not all that mechanically exciting better graphics might have given this a lift over the tough competition of rummyish games on the market.

Didn't like this that much at first. I think we were used to all of the different cards of Wyatt Earp and Jack the Ripper. But we tried it again and had a great time with it! The only special card is the Ted Hinton card. But it was fun trying to manipulate the car to get the most points. Definitely a very light game, but sometimes that's what we're in the mood for.

RATING: 5
One play.  It's Mystery Rummy but it is very different than many of the other games.  The board play.  There are things you can do to work the board and you definately want to be the one to be getting the cards as if you are, you get the sweet bouns of the Bonnie and Clyde cards.  I think once we play more, the strategy will come out more.  I liked it, but time will tell if I love it like Capone or Ripper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Another good game in the Mystery Rummy series. I like the opportunity to double your meld by skillfuly moving the wooden car. I also like that there is only one type of gavel/special card (FBI cards) and you have a choice of actions when playing that card. The components (cards) are inferior to the other M.R. games. The black-bordered cards quickly show pay wear on the edges, and I'm afraid that the Bonnie and Clyde cards might begin to look different (less worn on the edges) relative to the rest of the cards. I dislike the graphical choices for the location cards, and overall the at and graphics look good but are functionally poor choices. Small font and busy, non-constant images within a "suit" make it difficult to keep track of which suits/locations have been played to the table and discard stack.

RATING: 6
If you like mystery rummy games, you'll probably like this as well.  I thought the mechanism of moving the car around trying to bust Bonnie & Clyde was very clever and added some tension to the game.

If you've never played a mystery rummy game before, they're essentially spiced up and themed rummy variants.  So, lots of draw a card/play sets type of stuff, but with twists that aren't present in standard rummy.

Unintentionally, adding to the fun are all the flavor text typos on the board, coining the phrase "like a rat burning barn"!  You also have the ability to catch Bonnie & Clyde in the great state of "Minnesta"!

It's Mystery Rummy, and there's a lot to like about that.  But it's pretty different from the others.  Manipulating the car through the different locations takes some getting used to.  And having only one type of "gavel" card, and having 15 of them in the deck, can lead to some lopsided deals.

An excellent addition to the Mystery Rummy series.  It's fun to manipulate Bonnie & Clyde's car and time your melds to maximize your score.  There's an extra psychological element of guessing where your opponent is trying to move the car,  It's sufficiently different to justify a purchase.

This is my favorite Mystery Rummy game. I've listened to two reviews of this, and here are my counters to each:

- "not very original" This game is a TON different than the other mystery rummy games! We didn't grasp the car concept until we'd played maybe five times. Once you see someone play the car correctly, you'll understand how different this title is than others.

- "the artwork gets in the way"  Overblown argument. We don't notice the artwork at all when playing. Although I too would have preferred this game to use art symbols similar to the other mystery rummy titles, it doesn't.

Overall, a fine mystery rummy game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fifth or sixth game in the Mystery Rummy series (depending on whether you count Wyatt Earp).  Players do the usual draw, meld, discard.  Meld suits are now locations where the dastardly duo did their deeds.  As you meld or lay off, Bonnie and Clyde's car moves up and down a game board depicting the locations. Melds against the car's current location score extra points, along with the chance to capture either of the pair for bonus points and a potential shutout.  Simple mechanics, but very good game play, with the car location adding an extra layer to the meld thought process.  Certainly a fresh look at the Mystery Rummy series - we enjoyed this game a lot.  Great art on the cards too - they storyboard the actions at the various locations, Lost Cities style.  Bad points - the meld suits look similar and are hard to tell apart across the table - plonk a spare cube on the game board to show the location is active (two player we just meld against the board, but three/four player games this will be a problem).

The production on this was horrible - misspelled words, poor grammar on the board, horrid orange car, and a really over-sized box.That bumps it down a couple of points in my book.

My wife and I enjoy them quite a bit, and this offering is good, if not really groundbreaking.

Another Rummy game.  I would probably rate this one higher if it weren't for the absolutely horrid design of the game.  It was so horrible that I had to get someone to do a [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/648947/bonnie-and-clyde]re-design[/url] of the game through artscow.  As for the actual gameplay.  It's interesting in trying to find Bonnie and Clyde and then getting the car to move to to various locations so you can get them, as well a s score bonus points for melds that are laid.  It seems a lot easier to get points in this Mystery Rummy game and the 100 point games almost goes to quick.  I would probably recommend 150 or 200.  Again, there are better Rummy games out there, but this one is decent if you play with functional cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good introduction to Mystery Rummy and even Rummy.
Bonnie & Clyde is  decent game and an intelligent twist on the whole rummy genre.  It's fun to play, but is as it's heart rummy and as such really random and dependent on the luck of the draw (I believe Rummy was originally a game for gambling).  I felt there were a little too many Ted Hinton action cards, but that card (along with moving the police car across the locations) does add a little tension and stategy not found in classical Rummy.  However despite several games, I have never seen both Bonnie & Clyde be captured by the same player.  Also, it's quite a different 2 player game vs. 4 and following the old addage that optimum player # = max # - 1, 3 is the sweet spot here.  Theme I suppose works to some degree, art albeit is amateurish, but at least it's not just diamond and heart shapes on a white background (how spoiled we all are now).  Fun, quick to play and easy to grasp for all, children to grandparents.

RATING: 5
Of the 4 mystery rummy games played to date, this seems to be the weakest so far. The game play revolving around finding Bonnie and Clyde is kind of boring and I don't like the lack of negative scoring at the end of the rounds. But with that said, I'd still say it's a decent game, with some original mechanics that make it a mystery rummy. Fantastic art though, if you're a game art junkie, you may want to pick this title up.

RATING: 7
[1 play] On the whole, I enjoyed this latest Mystery Rummy game, but there are definitely some things I don't like about it.  As usual, it blends familiar rummy gameplay with some unique twists, which is good.  But I don't really like the visual direction this game has taken.  It's made a sharp turn away from the look and design of the other MR games.  The cards have no historical flavor text (which I found interesting and cool in the other games), but are just pictures, and the captions on them are really hard to read.  They also don't have any of the functional symbols we're used to from the rest of the MR series.  So the cards seem strangely blank, and you really have to fill in the knowledge from the rules.  I would MUCH rather have had B&C be like the rest, with smaller pictures, functional info that was clearly legible, and interesting historical background text.  On the other hand, halfway through the game we realized that the art had a Lost Cities thing going on; for each location there are 6 cards, and they aren't identical.  They show different parts of the scene or make an action sequence.  That's sort of cool, but you can't really appreciate it fully while actually playing the game.

Good little Mystery Rummy game.  Nice artwork and production- great card stock.  More a traditional card game than a Euro, so best played with family and non gamers.  Plenty of good card play once you get the swing of how the car moves on the board.  You can really set up some nice chains of moves and set up for a 'big turn'.  Our games have been very fun with surprise endings and some big point swings.

Al Capone remains the simplest of the series and Jekyll and Hyde the least interesting.  Jack the Ripper is cool but is the most convoluted to teach to a non gamer, and I've only played it a few times. 

I think Bonnie and Clyde is a great way to try out the series.  Just make sure you're prepared for a traditional card game with extra strategy, not a fancy Euro.

Note: I've only played Bonnie and Clyde two player, and it was great for that number.

Love mystery rummy and really like the twist in this of getting double points for any melds of layoffs of the location where the detective's car is currently located, as well as the possibility of apprehending Bonnie or Clyde for a 15 point bonus each if they are also at that location.  Nice bit of added strategy to try to manipulate where the car is.  Simple box contents.  Simple rules.

Not the best of the Mystery Rummy variants.  Hunting for Bonnie and Clyde is cool, and there is quite a bit of strategy in moving the car around to increase the value of your melds, but it feels like you can get hosed more in this one due to bad draws than in the other games.

Plus, some really questionable graphic design choices (can you tell the "suits" apart from across the table?)  And there are weird typos abounding on the board and box...uh, ok.

Still, I enjoy it enough.  I would just reach for other Mystery Rummy games first.

The rummy part of the game is simply drawing cards and hoping that they match with your hand. Ted Hinton cards add specific extra element of card lottery as you're in a strongly weakened position if you don't happen to draw them at all.

This is Mystery Rummy with linear tactical board game-play!  

The KEY nuances of this game lies in learning/planning how to move the Car so that you can end up doubling your melds and layoffs points.  

You can play one card layoffs to maneuver the car for 4 point melds or 4 pt layoffs or capture Bonnie or Clyde or gain higher car bonus for ending the round.  

This is Mystery Rummy with tactical board game play!  You can bluff your opponents by taking what they discard to throw them off. Or, peek at a Location card and do not take it.  

You can even try to go out early and catch your opponents off-guard for a quick round.  I hear the Shut Out is really rare so I'm aiming to try for that one of these days.  

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Meh, this was an okay at best Mystery Rummy.  It is one of the most simplest rummy variations/themes out there.  The idea behind scoring melds and such double value when played at the same spot(suit) the car is located is an interesting twist but there still isn't enough interesting decisions to make.  There is definitely some of the desperation of the search for Bonnie and Clyde as you do NOT want one person finding both of them as you could be potentially shut out of points.

Better than expected. I imagined that the component 'issues' would annoy me, but they didn't at all. I wish the game looked more like a traditional Mystery Rummy game. It feels like an economic game where you maximize your points by getting the 'getaway car' to your best commodity, er, location.

More straightforward than Wyatt Earp - the only other member of the Mystery Rummy family I know, and even then it's only a stepbrother - in what you do during a turn, but it feels more strategic and involved regarding timing and going with the flow of the other players´ actions. Getting absolutely clobbered during my first game drove this point home rather forcefully.

RATING: 8
A great rummy-style game with plenty of opportunities to make it a strategy game. 
I like all the artwork, they are just telling the whole story like a vintage movie (even the same location cards are different to expose more atmospheric moments of the story).
With the main gameboard and the car on it the gameplay becomes really exciting and manipulative - moving a car is possible with different tactics to achieve a greater impact when playing cards from hand. The detective (Ted Hinton) "wildcard" is offering 3 flexible options for the players to get into position. However the outcome is down to collecting points, it's still a fun chase to find Bonnie and Clide and "arrest" them. On the way there are bluffs one can use to keep others away from them once they've been discovered.
It also does matter how the payer handles the cards: keep them for a blast or play them as they come. Both strategies can be winners in accurate situations.
So overall I see lots of fun hours ahead of us with this game.

Hard to gauge after a single play; there is obviously scope for clever stuff involving saving layoffs for one big turn, and probing for information - even a little bluffing.  However, it seems somewhat less themed than Wyatt Earp or Jack the Ripper, our two favourite rummy games so far.

RATING: 8
I'm a big fan of the Mystery Rummy series overall but didn't care for B&C at first. However, it grew on me with repeated plays, all two-player, to the point where I really like it now. It's certainly better than Rue Morgue and at least as good as Jekyll & Hyde, although those games have more pleasing (not to mention more functional) graphic designs.

I find the unique, maneuver-the-car aspect of the game to be very interesting. Finding both Bonnie AND Clyde for the shutout is rare (I've only seen it happen five times, twice for and thrice against) but the fear of your opponent achieving it adds a nice tension to the game. [53 plays]

This is another nice addition to the Fitzgerald Rummy series of games.

A mini board is included here and Bonnie and Clyde are hidden at 1 of the 10 locations. The melds played correlate to towns that Bonnie & Clyde rampaged through and clever card play is required to move the Crime Spree Car in order to gain bonus points for playing melds and playing lay-offs. 

This is definitely lighter fare than some of the games in the Mystery Rummy series and only 1 gavel card is present in Ted Hinton, but he allows 1 of 3 choices. 

I like this game quite a bit and it doesn't play overlong with 3 hands usually seeing a winning score posted.

RATING: 7
A good variant on Rummy, as most of Mike Fitzgerald's variants tend to be. The twist here is that you are trying to position a car on certain spots along a card row. You can shut out your opponent if you get both the Bonnie and Clyde cards, but you can also take others along the row. They're all hidden though, so taking some will narrow down the possible locations for those sought after cards to your opponent(s). The FBI Agent card serves as the sole "gavel card" in this version, which works, but it can sometimes feel like a drag when you have a bunch of them in your hand. This isn't my favorite of Fitzgerald's Rummy variants, but it's definitely one I enjoy. If nothing else, the card row is an interesting twist, and I like that it's really easy to track what your cards score.

An interesting game, though not in the same league as Jack the Ripper, or Wyatt Earp.

Some very strange artwork choices leave this gameplay with VERY little connection to the them.  That had already been a weakness with this series, but this particular game is by far the worst offender in this regard.

My advice:  If you have all the other Mystery Rummy games, you'll want to have this one too.  If you're new to the series, pick up the others first.

I enjoyed this far, far more than I expected to. The luck-run mechanics of gin are here tempered by a couple of points-scoring targets and a good card turnover rate, thanks to the 'wild' cards. It's all set off delightfully with gorgeous art and presentation.

Really not suitable for more than 2P, though.

So much fun. Played only with 2p so far, but really enjoy the simplicity of the card play, the engine that runs the car on the board and the resultant complexity around where to play and where to hold off. Love the options available each turn, the deep layers of strategy and the competitiveness that is emerging from our games. Based on reviews and the depressingly low price of this game at The Works here in the uk I expected very very little but am absolutely delighted with it - One of my favourite games right now.

Ps. I have yet to win even a single hand. My wife has grokked every element of this game and is running rings around me. I am as incompetent as the eponymous heroes of the game

RATING: 7.4
Another very nice mystery rummy game...have not been disappointed with one yet! Basic rummy except for an interesting strategy of laying your melds down at the best time to get the best points! If you lay down a meld that matches exactly where B+C's car is on the board you may lay it sideways for more points. When playing the Hinton card you may draw 2 cards from the deck, choose a card from the discard pile, or choose to look at a card in play under the board. You can only capture B or C if your meld matches the exact number the car is on and B or C (for a 10pt bonus)is in that location! You may peek or keep cards with layoff's also, you just can't keep B or C! If you manage to capture both B and C you win...all other players are shut-out!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's for Rummy lovers only. It doesn't score the higher marks that other Mystery Rummy games and Wyatt Earp get because it's just too simple. It's draw one, meld, discard one. There's just the one special card - similar to the "Wyatt Earp" card - which allows you to draw 2 or pick from the discard pile. The meld sets are numbered 1 through 10, and there's a board with spaces labelled 1 through 10, with a car starting on space 1. Everytime you meld the car moves up the track 1 space and everytime you layoff the car can move either up or down 1 space. This is important because if you meld or layoff the same number that the car is on, then you tap the cards played and they'll score double. This manipulation is the only thing of interest really, and it's not that interesting. Your result is still very dependent on the hand you're dealt, scattered or grouped by number, high or low. With a high hand you'll probably be tempted to play a waiting game and hope that others don't go out before you get a chance to play your hand out as and when the car has moved to the high numbers. That might create some tension for you, otherwise this is straight-forward rummy game which is more interesting than traditional rummy, for sure, but not the most fun version in the series.

This game is basically rummy, with some extra ways to score thrown in.  Laying down cards lets you manipulate a car down a location track, and possibly capture Bonnie or Clyde for bonus points.  While the game is probably more compelling than rummy, it's debatable whether it's worth purchasing a published game over the public-domain original.

Accessible, like all the games in the series, but also not quite enough to think about. Rummy is like that, I guess. No complaints about the artwork, but the spelling errors were up there with Twilight Struggle! Wyatt Earp is still the one to beat when it comes to rummy, but I'd happily play three rounds of this - it does reward a bit of forward thinking and, again, the theme is great.

This is a rummy variant. Unfortunately on our first play one of the players was not keen on traditional card games so this went down like two brash gangsters shooting the place up.

Essentially a Rummy variant (it feels like a member of the "Mystery Rummy" series, although it isn't advertised as such), this game has a few things to make it a bit more interesting than the average Rummy game - but that isn't enough to make me ever want to play it (Rummy is by far my least favourite traditional card game). I also found this far too luck-dependent for my tastes.

Very good Mystery Rummy variant.  The movement of the car brings a nice level of strategy together with use of the Ted Hinton cards (effectively the Ripper Victims and Scenes rolled into one).  Has to be played up to 200 points otherwise over in two hands.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game has a serious flow issue, and it boils down to the Ted Hinton cards. If you are lucky and end up with several Ted Hintons in your hand the game flows well. If you don't get them, or run out of them, the game slows to a crawl.

If you have no Ted Hinton cards, you only draw one card a turn, while a player that keeps a good supply of them is always drawing three cards a turn. And the problem just feeds on itself; someone with Ted Hinton cards draws three times as many cards to get another Hinton Card, while someone that is limping along and really needs one has a much smaller chance of getting another one.

I think that this entry in the Mystery Rummy series ads some clever ideas with the location track, maneuvering the crime spree car, and hunting for Bonnie and Clyde; it just has a very uneven feel while playing it. I also question the lack of color-coding on the cards. It is very difficult at any distance to tell which sets have runs on the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
With only one "gavel" card - perhaps a simpler variant on the rummy series, but the car movement adds the twist that might make a touch harder.  The lack of text and card relationships might make this the "gateway" mystery rummy game.  With 20% of the deck being gavel cards - need to see playing to 100 (ie 3 or 4 rounds) is sufficient to smooth out unbalanced deals.

Egyszerű, römi alapokra építkező, Bonnie és Clyde sztorijára tetszetősen felépített darab. Kiváló minőségű kártyalapokkal és táblával.
Igazán poén, hogy a kártyák úgy vannak megrajzolva, mint a "pörgetős rajfilmek", amiket anno a könyv szélére rajzolgattunk, aztán végig pörgettük, mozgással feltöltve ezzel az egészet.
Magas szerencsefaktor, de ezt lehet valamelyest kompenzálni azzal, ha nem 100 pontig játsszuk, hanem tovább. Az artwork lenyűgöző, a pontszámát javarészt ennek köszönheti.

RATING: 8
A römi alapszábályára épít a játék, de a helyszínek között mozgó gépkocsi nagyon megdobja a játékélményt. A már felfedett helyszínek kártyáival könnyen lehet kombókat csinálni, hogy a gépkocsit mozgassa az ember mert számít a kártyák kijátszásánál, hogy éppen hol áll az autó. Ha pont azon a helyszínen amit a kártya jelöl, akkor a pontozásnál dupla annyit fog érni az éppen kijátszott kártya és még esély is lehet a két banditából az egyiket elkapni. Szerencsés időben fejezd be a játékot, mert a kocsi helyzete még sok pontot hozhat neked. Egy játék után jónak találom a rendszert, könnyed nem túlbonyolított, bármikor elővehetö tipus.
Update1: 4-en egy kicsit sok a holtidő és gyorsabban pörög a pakli, ketten sokkal jobb a játék.

It's not a bad version of the Mystery Rummy games, but I still prefer Jack the Ripper. This is a simpler game. Game play, including moving the car around looking for Bonnie and Clyde, works well although the artwork makes it a bit difficult to read the cards. It's basically Rummy, but with Bonnie and Clyde cards hidden in 2 of 8 locations (other cards placed in other 6 areas randomly): when you meld or lay off, you can move the car and look/take the card at one of these locations. Bonnie and Clyde are worth 10VP each, but you can only claim them if you meld or lay off at the car's current location.

Played it with four -- I'd guess it's better with 3 (or 2?), where you would have a bit more control over the car. Need to play again, but not necessarily a buy for me.

RATING: 6
[RGG 2009 edition] {Mystery Rummy; set-collection, card-drafting; optimal 2-3p} Similar to other Mystery Rummy games, Bonnie and Clyde is a solid rummy game.  The unique stuff in this game is the manipulation of the Crime Spree Car in order to arrest Bonnie and Clyde and to score more points.  There is only one kind of gravel card in this game.  Tactical choices about gravel cards are thus not as versatile as other Mystery Rummy games.  Nonetheless, for its large quantity (20% of the card), players usually has some Ted cards in hand and still have enough tactical choices.  Nothing ground-breaking in this game but it is fun to play.

The components are quite nice.  The cards are nicely illustrated.  I love the design that each card has its own graphics.  The board is good, too, for it's showing the story of Bonnie and Clyde.  However, the typos on the board are unforgivable.  The box is larger than necessary.

It isn't as good as Jack the Ripper, however, I'm glad I bought it.  The managing of the car is fun, and helps create a "combo" feel.  The decisions are new, but it feels like rummy. I do like how the low numbers are of higher value early and late numbers are of higher value late, which is similar (though reversed) to regular rummy.  It is a keeper.

Revisited:  Much better than I first thought, but it isn't Jack the Ripper.  But do you know what?  Few games are.

This is a simplified version of the system (one card can do three different things, as opposed to having three different cards that each do something specific), and it loosens up the game a bit, but at the same time allows for more strategy.  The timing of moving the car from place to place is a little tricky to get the first time around, but there's a neat mechanism in there to manipulate once you get it.  All told, I think I prefer the other iterations in the series over this one, but my wife likes it, so I anticipate it will get a lot of play.

RATING: 7
[i]Bonnie & Clyde[/i] is the gaming equivalent of mac-and-cheese as it's welcome and enjoyable, similar to that in other rummy games: Draw lots of matching cards, and you're more likely to score lots of points and go out. Draw a hand of singletons, and you'll struggle to empty your hand. As more and more melds are played on the table, the pace of the game play quickens due to more plays being available; a formerly dead singleton becomes a ticket to move the car and potentially pick up a card from the gameboard, which could then fuel more plays. Once you recognize this, you start playing "chicken" to some degree, especially with two players, as any melds you play give the opponent an opportunity to layoff cards and increase the points scored on melds due to hitting the right locations. You'll try to stockpile cards and play them all out at once, but by doing so you miss out on the free cards on the gameboard, which can often give you safe discards or boring ol' points.

While the game design is solid, it's paired with graphic design verging on the criminal. For my [url=http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/game_review_bonnie_clyde/]complete review[/url], visit Boardgame News.

This is the 5th in the Mystery Rummy series.  Though for copyright and legal reasons it's not called Mystery Rummy and the box style has changed.  The board is a nice addition to keep track of certain card plays but still got the mystery rummy twist to make it unique in the series.

While I like all of the previous titles in the series, I wasn't impressed by this one.
Way too much luck.

A new addition to the mystery rummy line. Melds that match where the police car is are a bonus. Nice game.

Very fun partnership game that must be played with 4 players.  The rules that come with the game leave a lot to be desired.  Due to that it took many readings and a complete read of everything on the Geek web page for this game to figure it out.  Worth it and our group now plays it quite a bit.

RATING: 6
A very novel trick-taker in which three tricks are played at once.  Each trick must have a different suit led and the fourth, un-led suit becomes trumps.  Spice is added by three cards with special abilities.  Unfamiliar mechanics and scoring give it a bit of a learning curve, but everything meshes together really well.  My concern is that there seems little scope to rescue a bad hand through clever play.  I think this is probably due to playing three tricks in three different suits at once.  That just leaves no way to mask a weakness.

I quite liked this 4-player, trick-taking game. It has polish and subtlety while remaining a team effort. It is terse and for a somewhat abstract mechanism, has decent thematic flavour.

{2 plays} I like it, even though some scoring rounds can end up crazy.  However, like Dia de los Muertos, I'm not sure I need yet another slightly wacky partnership trick-taking game for four.  Especially with Tichu around :)  Still, this one works nicely, despite the horrible confusion that is the rule book.

The game sounded like it might be kind of cool and certainly has some interesting ideas, but it just doesn't play very well.  It's a fairly interesting take on trick-taking, but it seems like you often are just forced to play cards rather than being able to make any real decision.  At the end, it just felt totally random who ended up winning what.  Overall, some neat ideas that just don't quite work.

A terrific game.  Considerably more complex than most trick taking games due to playing three consecutive tricks but the added complexity translates to a richer, more rewarding game.  Plays a little long, but never boring.  Wish I could interest more folks in it!

This one is hard to rate. I initially read one of the reviews and was intrigued. The review did suggest the game seemed confined but I got it anyway thinking the mechanism seems so interesting. Well after trying it out its just that, interesting but confining. I'm going to have to try it more to see how the longevity seems.

RATING: 6
Couple unique twists for a trick taking game: 
  1) 3 tricks being fought for in parallel.
  2) The trick you choose to play in determining who plays next.
  3) Trump being determined by the color that no one chose to lead with (each of the three tricks must be led with different colors, out of the 4 available).
Minus .5 for very poorly written rules.

Production: Clear iconography, and a unique photo for each card, though the cards are of mediocre quality.  Play: Very interesting game.  The calvary and artillery cards add just enough uncertainty to who is going to win any given trick, so that a three-star general is not a sure thing.  The changing direction of play, the simultaneous tricks, the successive rounds using the same depleting hand of cards, and the scoring system are all creative and well-integrated here.  This is a fresh, welcome addition to the trick-taking family.  (2 2 3) (2 plays)

The battlefield setting is well carried by the card play.  Since this is strictly a 4 player game, it will certainly cut down on the opportunities to play.  But we enjoyed the interaction between the different powers and the trump mechanic.  The semi-forced turn order also makes for interesting situations.  Well done.

No partner trick-taking card game better exemplifies the strategies and horrors of the American Civil War, I think.  :)  This is a really interesting game where you have to play suit to certain positions on the battlefield.  Playing with partners is the way to go with this one I think.  Nice photos from the Civil War on the cards.  If I had any complaint it would be I wish there was some captions on the photographs as to who this general was, or what battlefield am I playing on.  Fun game and very unique.

Seemd too chaotic.  2 newbies and 2 who had played previously in our group of 4 and we gave up after two hands.  Unfortunately it appears that the newbies (me being one of them) ended up with crappy hands which may have soured us on the game.  That and the colors screwed up the one color-blind person to the poit that he made bad strategic moves based on his thought that he had different colors than he had.  I think I should give it another shot though. *UPDATED* I gave it another shot after having the time to read the rules myself.  I enjoyed this game much more.  It's still a bit too fiddly for my taste, but not a bad game.

Very interesting game. Unlike my favorite trick taking game Pinochle, you play your meld AFTER the round. To do so you attempt to capture as much as you can by winning the tricks but sometimes you must go after specific targets to either increase your point gains or to form a good meld. The only downside to this game is that it requires exactly 4 players.

An interesting twist on the trick-taking genre, more different than most German card games (Sticheln, Njet, Mu etc.) since it has a theme. Another difference is in the directional nature of the card play, where the card you play determine who plays next.  It plays quite quickly, since you're only playing four cards, but it still feels a little too random.  I like the partnership aspect of the game.

It's not a wargame.  It's an excellent trick-taking game with a "loose" civil war theme that creates trick-taking suit conflicts between players.  Learning how your partner plays and what type of hand they have is also as important as thwarting you're opponents.  The really creative feature of this trick-taker is that some times you can decide who plays next with which flank or column you play your card(s). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Card game where you are playing three different games at once with the fourth suit being considered trump.  To add to the mix, you only score points for the soldier cards if you also have a general of that color in your possession.  It was an interesting play but I'm not certain I had a ton of choices most times where I could make strategic choices and when those instances came around, 75% of the time it was trying to outguess your opponent.  I would like to give the Honor game a try at some point as I've only played the basic Victory game.

Very good trick taking game. In fact, one of the best new ones I've played in a while. The twist in this one is that you play three tricks ("left", "center" and "right") at a time. If you play a card to your "left" trick, your left hand opponent must play the next card. It's a little complicated to wrap a strategy around at first, but it's a lot of fun and very interesting. Clever.

RATING: 7
Trick taking game based on the Civil War. There are four suits, but in any phase, only three suits are used, and each player has a battleboard depicting a right, left and center flank. Player order is determined by who plays on what flank. For instance, if you play on the left flank, then the player on your left has to play next. When everyone has played, resolve each flank to determine who takes the trick. There are special cards in each suit, such as artillery which can bomb your opponent's card, or cavalry which takes all cards if played last, or scouts which force an opponent to play on a particular flank. It's a fun partnership game, it just takes some time to figure out the cards, how to manoeuvre your team to play last and have the hammer, or attempting to short suit youself so you can potentially have trump.

Yet another fascinating "take" on the trick taking genre. This one works very nicely as a team game. I like the idea of simultaneously playing three tricks at once, and the special rules are nice features, but the game does have one major flaw in my eyes: if you get a bad hand you have no alternatives. In other words, the only real goal in this game is to take tricks. If you don't take tricks, you don't score - pure and simple. If you have a bunch of low-power cards, you have no hope of taking tricks through little fault of your own. There is no way to finesse a bad hand as there are no alternative goals, such as being able to go low (Spades) or avoid taking tricks and tread water. Nonetheless, a very fun and interesting game.

You receive ten cards and will play three sets of three tricks. By placing cards on the board, you play your three tricks face up and pass the play to another player. However some cards can remove others or simply take the trick, plus the trump is determined only once the suits of the other three tricks has been determine. An interesting twist on trick taking, which has only a minor link to the games theme, but if you like complex trick taking, it is worth a try.

RATING: 8
I've only tried the basic game.

A trick taking game with these features:

* Three tricks at a time are played to simultaneously (each player chooses which one of the three tricks he or she wants to play to)

* You can control which player plays next

* Each of the three tricks must be lead with different suits; the fourth suit becomes trump

This has many interesting consequences:

* Because you can control which player plays next, you can control who will get to determine the trump suit

* If you cannot follow suit, you play your card face down. However, that face down card can become trump!

This game causes a lot of confusion among new players. Surprisingly, players learn basic tactics quickly despite the bizarre rules (and the somewhat badly organized rulebook).

The only "flaw" with this game is that it plays with only four players, which limits playability.

Bleuch!  I heard good things about this innovative trick-tacking game before I bought it - but they were all wrong, let me tell you!

Card, Trick-taking. Interesting game. I think it rewards experience, so I would like to try it a few more times with my group. I think my rating would go up by point with repeated play. The simultaneous tricks and the way trump is set really makes this different from traditional games.

RATING: 5
I want to like it.  The system is very clever, but there are some elements that I perceive as flaws.  Now, I know it is a card game so there is going to be quite a bit of luck here, it comes with the territory, but there is just too much here for my taste.  In many of these kinds of games when you get a crap hand, you are offered strategies to bail yourself out (or at least to cut your losses), here there is just the condition that if you don't get a General (high cards) you can call a re-deal.  This indicates to me that it is just better to get high cards.  

There is just one strategy, win tricks.  The scoring implies that you should have the control to win certain kinds of tricks (set collection), but more times than not game play is so chaotic that it is catch as catch can.  While it would be nice to tailor your strikes, as you have little control over which suits are acceptable and the turn order, it seems that you just have to fly by the seat of your pants and take what is given hoping that it all sorts out well in the end.

I found it difficult to assess what my partner's needs could ever be.  I saw little opportunities for clue giving.

It seems that most of this game is just counting cards and playing the odds.

Once you get past the difficult rulebook, the game isn't all that tough.  That said there are a number of little rules that must be kept in mind.  The game seems a little more complex rule wise than both the chaos and the luck merits.

[JRG 04 edition] {trick-taking, partial-hand-passing, partnership, set collection, function cards; optimal 4p} I like special and fun trick-taking games. This easily gets into my collection with its many special mechanics - trump determination, partnership, card passing, 3 battle fields, etc.  Besides, it's more thematic than other trick-taking games.

The rule is too complicated for general players. At least, I won't play it with new or general players. It's more suitable for experienced players.

Innovative trick-taking game.

This is a strange twist on a trick-taking game, with a bit more chaos than I would like.  You have three tricks taking place simultaneously, but you don't have as much control over when to play a strong card to guarantee a trick, or how to determine trump.  The game makes sense, and even seems to work thematically, and it even has an element of how to manipulate the fronts to try to steer the tricks in the right direction, but it's very limiting, and not completely controllable.  It's a decent game, but not as good as other trick-taking games to make me want to play it more often.

3 plays: 4 players (basic rules)

The most unique trick taking game I've seen for exactly 4 players.  Plus, I love the ACW theme though the game could work with any theme.

Interesting trick-taking game. A bit concerned that the luck of the draw in terms of the generals might be too much, but really haven't played it enough to know.

Party game that you can play with as many people as you get. Difficult to rate a game like this. Worked very well in groups I introduced it to and it's one of my strongest recommendations if you're looking for a party game; but for me it's definitely "you need the be in the right mood" kind of game.

Not really a board game. The best thing about it is that there are no components, so you can play it anywhere, when on the road usually. Also non-gamers usually like it. We had a lot of fun with it.

I used to play this game using invented stories rather than printed cards during long drives. Now it would be much easier to play, but I do not drive so much.

RATING: 6.5
A very interesting game to play with friends on a party, you don't need a table, so very flexible to play sitting on a sofa or wherever you are with your friends, the number of players doesn't matter, too, so again, very flexible.

By the other hands, there are some very interesting cases and some of them are dumb, and this is a deduction game with no further depth, if you like deduction and investigation, there are better games, but for a crowd that doesn't play very often, this one is ok.

Too much of a group dependant sort of game, you can have an exciting or a boring experience depending on if the people will get involved, so i can't attribute the merits of a great experience to the game itself, but perhaps with big groups (over 10-12) the chances of a nice experience will increase.

A card game about resolving dark events, most of them being crimes/murders. It's a quick play and it's perfect for a creepy campfire atmosphere. Weird thing is that I found the solutions were either too easy or impossible to find. Still fun though.

No es realmente un juego, más bien acertijos de pensamiento lateral pero es muy socorrido para jugar en un viaje en coche o en el descanso del café.

Perfect game in a car and even driver can play. There is only a slight element of competition, so it is more like play than game, but still if you guess what happened you win. if you don't want to play anythink, you can play Black Stories. That really doesn't matter. It is fun, laughable, interesting idea. Good for 2 and more.

As a social activity might work with the right crowd.
A once around ice breaker if you run out of other
conversational topics. Grisly riddles and murders must be solved by questions which can be answered by either
yes or no. If your feeling like Sherlock Holmes this might tickle your fancy. Zero replayability once the 50
macabre situations have been discussed and solved.

As of Jan '16 (50 plays) - 10: Can I rate this as a 10 when it has zero replayability? Well the description still holds that if you have something like this for me (i.e. a mystery where I have to ask a bunch of yes/no questions to solve), then yeah I'll always love it.  Great for road trips, and groups if they're into that.

Black Stories is a printed version of a popular campfire game, just like Werewolves/Mafia. The game master describes a setting (usually involving death or murder or somesuch, hence "Black") and the players try to figure out how that situation came to be, using only questions that the game master can answer with yes or no.
The game can be a fun diversion, and it's great to have a collection of stories available to tell. Unfortunately, you can only solve each riddle once. The quality of stories collected here varies greatly. Some are hilarious (mostly those with a more involved backstory which you can attack from multiple angles), others are simple hit or miss.

Jeg er ikke sikker på, at Black Stories: English Edition kvalificerer sig til at være et spil, men det er i hvert tilfælde god selskabelig underholdning. Black Stories: English Edition fordrer, at deltagerne har den smule tålmodighed, der skal til for at man lige når at finde ud af at hvordan man skal løse den type gåder, der i bund og grund er tale om. Giver deltagerne sig hen til spilllet er det til gengæld solid underholdning og kan man huske et par af historierne, kan man spille spillet stort set når som helst og hvor som helst.

An interesting deck of riddles that can be used to play a dark guessing game.  Might be good with a group.  Some of the riddles are very vague, even for a lateral thinking exercise, but that's chiefly because the answers are pre-written with a vague hypothesis.

A bit on the edge of what I would call a game. Some stories are cool (unfortunately, only a handful), some are ancient and known to those who played the unboxed version decades ago, some are boring and some plain ludicrous. The whole thing feels a bit half-baked. If you play it, the storyteller will have to flip through several stories to find something good, so the number of stories which will get played is probably rather low. After two short sessions, I am done with this (at least with the first edition).

NA version Dark Stories.  50 scenarios where a DM answers yes/no questions about a tragic or deadly story for someone to solve the crime.  Sort of like Tragedy looper in that you cannot look through cards or it wreaks it for you to play.  Need to play with the right people or it's painful.  Mainly a story telling/adapting game.

Always starts with excitement and curiosity, and ends with frustration and disbelief. The consensus of people I've played it with is that no one would ever be able to guess the stories and that they don't want to play it again.

Thrown away because it's not worth the trouble of selling.

This is a lot of fun with the right group, with each case being a puzzle to be solved.

At the start of each case one person reads out a statement on one side of a card (most of which involve a death), then the others players have to figure out what happened by asking questions of the card-holder that can be answered only by either a yes or a no. The card holder has access to additional information on the other side of the card upon which he bases his answers.

A lot of the cases can be quickly solved with a flexible questioning approach (often starting with 'was it a murder?', 'was anyone else involved?', 'did they know each other?' etc.) but every now and then there's a killer case that can leave the players baffled for 20 minutes - and they're the best! 

It's surprising how often the players can get stuck in a rut, asking essentially the same question a variety of different ways but that usually indicates that they're missing something and need to try a different approach.

Only downside is limited replayability as once you've solved a case you can't really go back to it, but that's the same with any case-based game. There are a lot of cases in the box and it's not particularly expensive so it's not a big deal.

Basically a series of lateral thinking puzzles printed in card-deck form but unfortunately, the solutions are often absurdly convoluted and lead to the judge simply saying "close enough" - which is very unsatisfying. With some good editing and less absurd scenarios (some are HIGHLY unrealistic) this could have been much more solid.

RATING: 2
Storytelling game where one player knows the answer and tries to guide the others towards it.

Problem is... these stories are absurd. There are some very fun elements in there, like how it plays with some of our proconceived notions/prejudice, but... the stories are just too far out there.

A friend of mine got it, we finish the whole 50 cases on the course of the weekend. Really fun game, every one, including those who usually don't want to play board games, played and had fun with it. 

But it's a very light game and a few of the cards are not as good as the others, the other downside is that there is little replay value, unless you play as the narrator for a different set of people.

Well, it passed the time while we were waiting to eat, but it is more of an activity than a game.  It is a game we played ourselves by making up situations, and didn't need any cards to tell us a story, but I guess people a bit lazier now.  The stories we had were all a bit off-beat, which I guess is the intention, but some of the solutions were rather convoluted to the point of being annoying.

Se encuentra un cadáver en extrañas circunstancias y un grupo de gente de pronto saca su gorra y su pipa y empieza a preguntar al master de turno hasta resolver el enigma. 
Preguntas que han de contestarse con "sí", "no", "irrelevante" o "supuesto falso". 

Juego entretenidísimo de imaginación, deducción, creatividad y que no requiere espacio en mesa. Perfecto para grupos de gente que están cómodamente sentados en el sofá, viajando, o para pasar un rato sin mover fichas. 

Importante tener un buen nivel de comprensión, lógica y capacidad verbal. Si no, puedes andar muy, muy despistado, ya seas master o jugador. Existen muchas situaciones en las que es verdaderamente difícil responder "sí" o "no", o escoger entre ambas.

A strange game! A short story is read...everyone asks questions to try and guess how or why the story could have happened! A game of guessing intuitively and putting together facts from what you learn and know to be true! The stories are usually odd and unusual dark ones involving suicide, accidental deaths, etc...thus the name Black stories fits perfectly! 

Once you have solved all the stories in the deck, the game will probably be used up...but you can use it again if you play the moderator and let new groups of people try the game!

It's an activity based on the old "what am I - 20 questions" rather than a game per se. One player reads the solution by themselves, and then reads out to the group what the situation is (typically a sentence about what someone's done) and the group need to work out the back story and the explanation for why they did it, asking only yes/no questions until they get it. Which can in turns be engaging and frustrating, quick or long. The fun depends on who you're playing along with and whether you enjoy starting with nothing and coming up with something through a process of elimination.

"More of an activity than a game. Basically, it's '20 Questions' but with a murder/horror mystery theme. It's a perfect filler to play while people are eating or otherwise can't use their hands"

What I like:
- Small box, simple rules
- Usually plays quickly
- Can be played while eating, or in the car
- There are a lot of cases in the box

What I don't like:
- Some of the cases are pretty weird

As always I thought my brother was making a big mistake when he was buying it, and as always I was forced to eat my words.

Nothing really special, but there are times that this one is exactly what you need. 

When everyone is kind of bored and they are not sure if they want to play a game and someone is sitting at the couch, someone at the table and somone on the floor and don't wish to move, or you don't have enough room to set a board (let's say on the bus), get this game out of the closet.

Nice and easy. Anybody who has an idea speaks, some good laughs and evnings just fly. 

No replayability when everything is done with but as I already said very, very usefull. I try to ensure a certain point of diversity in my collection and for that reasoon only this is a must have. I;ll propably buy Black Stories 2 & 3 probably.

(Wife Control: No complaints at all. Always in for one more.)

More a murder mystery activity/puzzle than a game, but found it very enjoyable. This was the scenario....how did it happen? You can only ask yes or no questions to try to determine how the scenario came to be. Some are insanely easy, some are rather complex and require a great deal of thought. It works your brain in a different way and was always fascinating to see how people's brains work for the exact same scenario.

We have been playing this at parties, friend-gatherings, family stuff, college, traveling, everywhere, FOR YEARS.

People really warm up to this, with or without alcohol, usually after or during food. 

It makes one of the best Ice Breakers I have ever found. Even better than Werewolf games or Charades.

There is nothing bad to say about this game. People freaking request it. They say, "hey, bring black stories with you to the restaurant yea?" or "Did you remember to grab those black story cards? I love those!".

You will never regret getting these, they've made so many nights more fun than they could have been without.

I don't mind 'guess the bizarre story with only yes/no questions' but these are not particularly well executed.  They are either so specific even if you figure them out you will not officially win, or so non sequitur that there is nothing to go on.  I prefer the type (that are too rare in this game) where there is clue that is bizarre until the story is revealed, or a play on works that makes sense in retrospect.

VERY impressed with this game. It reminds me of another game I used to play back when I was first getting into the hobby called Q90, but this is even better. Some of the stories are incredibly ridiculous leaps of logic, but it's always a blast trying to think outside the box as to what happened. This game is tailor made for road trips and works well with very large groups as well as just two. I really enjoy it.

Some of the stories are clever riddles of the locked door mystery type. Others add unnecessary detail to the solution and prompt a general house rule of "close enough is fine". It's good with a willing group, but others may not find as much humour as I do in murder, bloody death, and suicide.

One player reads a short description of a rather dark scenario, then other players have to ask questions & guess the explanatory back-story. Situations ranged from blindingly obvious to bizarrely unlikely. I guess it helped fill the time while waiting for a meal, but old-fashioned conversation would have worked at least as well.

RATING: 6
Maybe you know some (the most?) of the stories, but usually the solutions are crazy. Maybe you don`t know this version. 

It`s important to have someone in a group who will make many questions. When you don`t ask, you wan`t find the solution. It`s not a game for everybody. When you don`t find a solution after few questions (and few questions are usually to less) some players don`t have ideas for next questions and want to know the solution.

You can play it almost everywhere (maybe not in a very loud place, but you have this with every game). You can play it in a car, with the driver!

All this would be to less, but the price is very nice.

Some of the stories are stupid. Even if you guess what happened, do you really need to guess all the details as well? Sometimes they have nothing to do with what actually happened and can be anything. Some sort of key words should be written in bold text and when you get the main idea that should be enough and you have cracked the mystery. We made a house rule that guessing the main point of each story is enough, but it gets confusing since different people may consider different things to be important as others think they are unnecessary details.

I'm sure this is a perfect way to spend an evening for those who like these sort of brain teasers.

RATING: 2
The concept is interesting (although not new, I played this kind of thing when I was a kid but without cards, just as a story that you have to solve with yes or no questions), but I found the stories really bad, overcomplicated in a bad way. It is normal that they should not be crystal clear so you take some time to unravel the mystery, but it is not normal that it makes no sense whatsoever.

Yes, I rate this a 6, but, like many, I don't see this as a game. It is great to pull out when there is a lull in the conversation.  

I will continue to seek out more editions.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 5

RATING: 7.5
[thing=18803][/thing] is a light deduction game that couldn't be easier to teach: in the case, one reads what had happened, than this person reads the sentences in the front of the card to the other persons. Based only in this sentence or sentences, the players are allowed to make all kinds of questions, and the one who read the solution, can only answer "yes", "no" or "irrelevant". This isn't something new, since is basically the same premise of the 20 Questions game.

So cases are indeed better than others, but basically all of them were fun to play. Sure, it helps that I played with a big groups of friends, all having laughs about someone dumb question, others that don't make even the smallest sense, or be overjoyed when someone makes that key question that puts everything into focus.

This is other major plus for [thing=18803][/thing]: you can basically play it in any crowd, with as many people as you have present. Even in a classroom of 30, 40 students. Sure, more people, more chaos, if questions came several at one time, and it is more than possible to not hear what someone ask or the answer to a question. You still need to hear and be heard if you want to play [thing=18803][/thing].

Also, it is possible to play anywhere. I played a couple of cases in the car, others in a pizza place, and a friend's play while shaving. It is only necessary to be able to read a few sentences and be able to talk freely. Nothing more. And if you manage the not big task to remember the whole solution of a case, you don't even need to carry the card.

I found [thing=18803][/thing] to be a big surprise: engaging, fun, easy to play and teach, portable and it is cheap. Sure, it is a game with a due date: once you complete the 50 cases, you will either have to get new ones, if you usually play with the same people. But you still can give as gift! Or continue to play, if you have several groups to play.

[thing=18803][/thing] is a big hit with everyone in my gaming group!

Here, this kind of things is called Lateral. If you played/read only one of these things before and liked it, this game might be for you.

But, if you ever got exposed to several of them, and like them - avoid this box. The laterals included are the most widespread ones. They appeared in a dozend of books and many places on the web before. 
At a recent gaming event, it happened that 4 people played this 'game' at a nearby table. I heared 6 of the stories. I already knew 5 of them, and for each story, at least one of the players had to skip because he already knew it.

In addition, even if they are new for you, replay value is absolutely zero.

If you want to try, better get Black Stories 2 or 3. The same thing, but at least less common stories, so higher chance you don't know them already.

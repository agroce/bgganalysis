RATING: 6
There's no Annus Mirabilis, so major doubts about the otherwise quite clever naval game. Worse than that, they don't seem to have worked out the problems with the Entreprenant card, which further devalues any naval strategy. It can win on turn 3. The cards are tad symmetrical, which may rapidly get dull. The strategic situation seems  to comprise three reasonably complex theatres that don't support each other much. Overall more 1812 than 1775.

I think 1754 is a great entry or next step into the wargame genre.  The combat mechanics are simple but they work well and can set up some interesting movement of troops. The game has a lot of neat little mechanics at play: different dice for different factions, different turn order each round and the potential for a forced end game. Also it is one of the rare games that allow for 2v2. 

A good game for sure. When I want to play a lighter wargame and don't want the hassle of setting up Memoir or  want something larger scale and , I'll go with 1754.

This is the first game in the Academy Games “Birth of America” series that I've bought. Choosing which to go for wasn't easy. 1775 seems to be the most popular, judging by number of comments on BGG, and so I didn't get it for that reason (it was most likely that a fellow gamer in my group might already have it). 

1812 has long interested me as a period of history ever since reading the fantastic account of the war by Pierre Berton. However, much as I like asymmetry in a game, several commenters seem to think having three players versus two seriously unbalances it.

So 1754 it was, and I'm not disappointed. 

It's full of tricky tactical decisions because you never seem to have enough movement, which is generated by your cards, to stem every enemy advance while also putting your own pressure on their weak spots. The rapid sea movement means that you also need to keep an eye on coastal areas to your rear which might seem safe but could see a sudden enemy incursion. 

The rules are simple - I agree with the poster elsewhere on BGG who said it puts more complicated wargames to shame - and it moves along snappily. There's little down-time because you're either attacking or being attacked for much of the game, and frequently all four players are involved in resolving battles. 

As for the dice throwing to determine combat, I know it won't appeal to everyone but I'd much rather have it than a deterministic combat system (such as in the turgid and incomprehensible [thing=18098]Napoleon's Triumph[/thing]). Having different sets of dice for the various factions is lovely – so militia might run away, but regular troops never will. Militia players however have the benefit of more dice.

Even when the dice go against you, you've got your team game to share the capricious antics of lady luck with, which makes for a very social and noisy experience. Besides, where's the harm in a bit of dice chucking as a change of pace from luck-free Euro worker-placement? Vive la difference.

I'm not persuaded by the fleeing militias of both sides returning to the muster towns en masse. It can lead to "tides" of blocks building up in a way I don't recognise from history. I'll experiment with solutions.

However, without these vast militia armies it can be very difficult to overcome a mixed colour force in a fortress.

So far I like—but don't love—1754.  It plays quick and is easy to teach and learn.  It combines some good aspects of Eurogames with a nice dice-rolling mechanic.

But for a wizened old grognard like myself, the fact that the game lacks any notion of fronts or supply lines does allow for some irksome moves, such as allowing large forces to operate utterly surrounded deep in enemy territory.  But these are the squabbles of a crotchety old wargamer.  I'm not sure they will bother many others.

I have yet to try it with four players, and am excited to see how that dynamic works—as there will necessarily be tension between the European and colonial sides of each faction.  I have also yet to try it as the French.

A huge fan of 1775 Rebellion and 1812 Invasion of Canada. Describing these games: Simple, yet satisfying. Historically flavourful, yet playable. If you and some of your gaming buddies can only devote a few hours to a campaign, you can finish this one. Enough unpredictability to keep it fresh over multiple games.

Have pre-ordered and highly anticipate 1754. Will be supporting the Kickstarter campaign for 879: Viking Invasions of England.

Card driven war game.  My first impression is this game may be a tad better than 1775.  The addition of the forts and muster points were a significant improvement to an already solid system.  Felt more strategic than its sibling, 1775. 
 Looking forward to playing it again.

RATING: 5
Game was much too symmetrical for my tastes to be satisfying (why do the French have the same amphibious capability as the British???) and the map situation seemed fragile, with an early strategic advantage creating a swift cascade.  Worst of all, there was no effort to differentiate the two sides through event cards or recruitment.  Thumbs way down for the history and would rather play 1775 for this kind of game.  Better than the 1812 one though...

Well made game. Randomness is notably high in this game (I refer random turn order) so it feels like simulation instead of chess like precision. Looking for more plays to nail down how much I enjoy it, as I'm not huge fan of luck swings, but there is games I tolerate them and enjoy anyway.

Quick Impression: Forts and native reinforcements are minor enhancements, but the ability for the "major" factions to travel by sea makes the game feel more open that 1812. For some reason, seems like it might be better as 2P than 4P.

Not as chaotic as 1775 but more fluid than 1812.  Don't use the rulebook set-up rules, use the revised rules (Louisbourg not a fort?!).  The slide-on covers for the cube trays are a really nice addition, all the components are first rate.  The fort and muster rules add variety and interest.  Maintains the high standards for "fun" of the other games.  There are a few map and rules ambiguities that should be cleared up in an FAQ.  There seem to be two separate games in the west and the east.  That's where a lot of the tension comes from.  Overall didn't enjoy quite as much as 1775.  Maybe I'm tiring of the basic system.

RATING: 5
CDGs are a favorite and I don't need them to be very complex to enjoy them, but 1754 fell flat for me.  The Combat resolution is only a step above roll to hit with unique die faces for each of the four factions.  Card selection involves minor choices between the number of armies you can move and how many spaces they can move.  Variable game ending puts pressure on each side to always push for control of an equal number of victory spaces as your opponent.  Fighting for control of the neutral Indians adds some nuance and is critical for soaking up losses.  But this collection of positives leaves one with a strong sense of repetition.  Movement was almost too flexible, always providing good opportunities to take an opponents victory location.  Perhaps supply rules would have created a more historical feel and avoiding having your cubes all over the place, almost randomly assigned to victory locations.  Adding a very attritional form of combat to the mix, you are left with a balanced game, but one that relies on the luck of the dice to create an advantage rather than player skill.  Disappointing because I really enjoy Conflict of Heroes and Strike of the Eagle from the same company, each of with provide the players with a richer range of choices in an introductory wargame package.

I enjoy the Birth of America series because it imparts the flavor of its historical topic without burdening it with big rulebooks and thousands of counters. Some people like that kind of thing and I do too on occasion. On the other hand, a game that can be easily taught and played in under a couple of hours is more likely to see time on my game table than complex beasts that take days to play. 

1754 is slightly more complex than the others (mainly due to the fortification rules) but you can still teach this game to anyone and finish it in an evening and still talk about it before calling it a night. 1775 is probably still my favorite (more due to the topic than anything else) but this one is probably my second favorite.Recommended!

1754 Conquest – The French Indian War    Board Game Review.  Publisher: Academy Games   Game Designer: Beau Beckett and Jeph Stahl   Price  $70.00
Passed Inspection: Concise elegant rules, beautiful components, visually pleasing, easy to learn and play, approachable even by non-war gamers
Failed Basic:  Flavor text on cards a little too small, not solitaire friendly
1754 Conquest – The French Indian War (hereinafter “1754”) is the newest game in Academy Games’ Birth of America series which includes 1775 Rebellion and 1812 The Invasion of Canada and, probably, should also include Academy Games’ Freedom: The Underground Railroad.  All of these games have been reviewed on this website!
The French Indian War has been covered in games such as GMT’s Wilderness War and A Few Acres of Snow by Tree Frog Games (both reviewed on this site) and 1754 joins the ranks of these esteemed games!
The hefty game box features beautiful artwork by Steven Paschal and tons of beautiful components including a sturdy tray to let the components fit snuggly and safely for storage.  The game includes a beautifully organized and concise 12 page rule book, a mounted 37” x 19” map, 5 sets of battle dice, 4 custom card decks broken down by faction (an Indian Alliance Card Deck is provided as an expansion and was used in this review) and 205 colored wooden faction cubes which represent armies.  Also provided for this review is a mounted Truce Board which is an expansion and was also used in our review.
The rule book is simply beautiful.  It starts with a two page spread showing how to set up the game and what various areas on the stunning map are used for.  The rules are covered with full examples in only 8 pages making this game accessible to neophyte war gamers.  Pages 9 to 12 cover a concise history of the French Indian War and is much appreciated by gamers wanting to put this game in historical context.
The game is playable by two to four players.  Regrettably, there is no real way to play the game solo at this time.  There are four factions – British Regular Troops and Navy, British Colonists, the French Regular Troops and Navy and the French Colonists.  The Native American tribes are a fourth faction who can be neutral or pro-British or French and they are not directly controlled by the other factions unless they join the factions either through treaty or by being drafted in to the army’s forces.
The forces of the factions are represented by blocks.  Red for the British Regulars; White for the British Colonial recruits; Purple for the French Regular Troops and Yellow for the French Colonial recruits.  The green blocks are for the various Native American tribes.
Each of the four factions have cards which provide random events (with wonderful flavor text that create learning moments while playing the game) as well as providing information on how many armies can move and how far they can move if the card is played.  My only complaint with the cards is that the flavor text is a little too small to easily read for “mature” gamers.
The game lasts from 3 rounds (for an introductory game) to 8 rounds for the full game.  Although the scale for each round is not listed in the rules, it can be assumed that each round is a year.  Each round is made up of the following phases – the reinforcement phase, the movement phase, the battle phase and the card draw phase.
During the reinforcement phase, the active faction can land troops at sea ports if they are British or French Regulars or muster troops if they are colonists.  In addition, fled units are reconstituted at friendly territories.
During the move phase, the active side uses their event and move cards.  Each player has cards that represent their faction and may play one move card or any number of event cards per round.  The normal hand size is 3 cards for each player.  When a card is used, it is normally discarded.  
Any group of units in a territory can be moved as one army.  A move card tells the player how many armies may move and how far they can move.  French and British Regulars may move from port to port by way of their navies.  The Great Lakes can be moved through with special event cards otherwise they are impassible.
Once two armies meet in a territory, they can battle.  Combat is efficient and quickly determined by the use of Combat Dice.  Each side has their own Combat Dice.  The dice are different depending on the side.  The British and French Regulars are more hard hitting and tend not to flee the battle as much as the colonists do.  The results that each die gives range from a “hit” which removes one enemy unit, a “flee” which results in one of the attackers units fleeing and being removed from the board and being placed in the fled units area on the map and a blank side known as the “command side” which means that one of the rollers units can conduct a strategic withdraw to an adjacent, friendly territory.  Forts help their owners by blocking some hits if the Fort Die reveals a good result.  Retreating armies can burn down their forts which can greatly hinder their enemy’s ability to withstand a later counter attack.
After fighting, the players can either withdraw or keep fighting until one side controls the territory.  Indian tribes cancel each other out on opposite sides until only one side has a tribe or tribes remaining.  Event Cards can be played to help one side or the other.  In our review game, the French attacked in the Pennsylvania area with a large army of united Indian tribes helping them but the British played the “William Johnson Indian Affairs” card which turned all the Indian Tribes in the territory against the French.  The French forces were decimated and the British held control of the territory.
Each side has one Truce Card which can be played as a movement card.  The Truce Card is then put on the Truce Tracker instead of being set aside.  When all four factions have played Truce Cards, the Treaty of Paris comes in to affect which ends the war.  Each side then counts up their controlled territories and the one with the most territories controlled is the winner and lays claim to East Coast and the Ohio River Valley of North America.  In our review game, the British lost control of the East Coast but held some small territories in the Ohio River Valley.  France held most of the ports and won the game.
The Indian Alliance Expansion adds cards for all the Indian Tribes in the territories.  Each side draws a card which gives extra victory points or abilities based upon the tribe which is allied with the faction.  A nice addition to a great game!
While not as complex as Wilderness War and A Few Acres of Snow, 1754 stands on its own as a very approachable game which is fast to play and easy to learn.  Our review game lasted less than 2 hours and was a great way to spend an afternoon.  One of the players in our review play did not really like traditional war games: she was more of a Eurogamer.  She really got in to the game and ended up loving 1754.
Be aware that 1754 is not solo friendly but it is a wonderful way for 2 to 4 gamers to have a blast!
1754 Conquest – The French Indian War is another classic game from Academy Games.  While not a down in the dust type of war game, its family friendly and easy to play.  Academy Games has even put out teachers guides for using their Birth of America games in the class room!  The future of the hobby needs more companies like Academy Games!

The best of the Birth of America gaming system.  Props to the designers for continuing to evolve the system.  The new port, muster and fort rules are great additions.  1754 plays out much different than it's predecessors because of the new rules and it seems like it's a little bit tighter game that rewards long term planning a bit more.

FUn and simple to learn, but too much emphasis on dice luck which takes away from the game. The mechanics and design are well done and the art is fantastic.

My favorite of the series.  Tension, historicity and a real comeback mechanism.  Love it.

Excellent game with a great theme that is not used to much.  I believe it is the best of the series

Very comparable to 1775: Rebellion.  Borderline redundant.  Since I own the other, I feel no need to own this one.

One of the most fun experiences I have had playing a game. Very suspenseful and interactive. I have played 2v2 games, which I have loved, but it obviously is a great 1v1 game, and some people may prefer that option. Easy to teach, easy to learn, LOTS of depth and tactical choices.

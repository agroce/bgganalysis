RATING: 5.5
This game is fine. I normally like race games (which this has some elements of, as you want to be the one to trigger the end game). However, doesn't feel like there's a good catch-up mechanic - so if you build a better engine, you're off getting points while everyone else gets further and further behind. Also - tiny cards spread over a large grid! It's nearly impossible to know what the cards do on the other side of the table, so it's always time to employ my favorite strategy of "ignore them and hope they weren't important."

RATING: 7
The first game felt too short and too long at the same time. (with the 2 player variant)
The game was more of a saunter than a fast paced race, and we artificially prolonged it (i.e. didn't hurry to build the last building). This made the whole thing rather boring.
It is a class above Dominion, though my initial rating is 6.

Update: The 2nd time, we went for a quicker game - which improved the experience and felt a bit more exciting. The rating improved to 7.

Valletta is a standard Euro-fare game that employs a deck-building mechanic that allows resource collection and management which in turn allows the buying and upgrading of buildings which in turn give points and adds better cards to your deck. There is even a deck culling mechanism. There are a couple of other gimmicks, but in essence the aforementioned is the heart and soul of the game.

Although Valletta offers nothing we haven't seen before, there is a certain charm and signature that Stefan Dorra implants into his games that merits attention and consideration; although I was a bit put-off by the take-that cards.

RATING: N/A
Deck-building and tableau-building style game that plays well. One of the interesting aspects of this deck-builder is that, once the game end triggers then everyone plays through their deck one more time. So, those with a bigger deck can get more turns.

It is a little flat. Not enough of a deck building aspect. Very hard to thin your deck. 
It is not offensive. But not that dynamic.

The rating is 6. But -1 adjustment for outrageous pricing on minimal components. This is publisher greed to market this in a oversized box for something that should have been half the price, compared to other standard releases in the board gaming industry.

This is a neat little take on a deck builder.  It is so simple to learn,  I bought and played it at my game group the same njght.  I never do that.  It has enough depth to keep it interesting, and just enough tension as you compete to build the best buildings in the town of Valletta.  The three of us that played it enjoyed it very much. 

I am not a big fan of take-that in games, but in this game, there is a little bit of it, but it fits the theme and is pretty mild.  For example, the Innkeeper card, when played, takes one coin from each player with at least one coin; the Monk card when played gets one good from each player that has at least 3 goods; the Tax Collector is the worst. He takes 1 good type from everyone that has 3 or more of that good type.  Sounds just like taxes to me!  : )

It has variable setup each game, and is a bit of work, but is worth it. The artwork is very nice and was done by the same artist as Lorenzo il Magnifico.  I am glad that I bought this game after viewing a short review on Man vs Meeple.

This is another resource conversion game where players can gain resources and special abilities buy purchasing sections of the town, which is built with cards every game. Pace of the game is maintained by awarding players extra points for building in the section of town the timer marker is currently located in. This makes it less effective to race off down the board right away and causes players to compete for areas. The theme is like every other euro game (old europe, grain, brick, etc.) and at this point, uninspired. The game's variable setup does allow easily for expansions and variety in play over time. I'd play it again if it came up but nothing that I feel I really need to add to my collection.

Based on such a cool idea - having buildings

Card that allows points for upgraded bldgs is powerful!

VALLETTA ist ein Deckbauspiel für Deckbau-Anfänger und solche, die sich mit Deckbau eher schwer tun like me. Ein Volkshochschulkurs Deckbau, der auf unprätentiöse Weise die Idee von Deckbau vermittelt und das Prinzip als eine Art Einzellerform von DOMINION leicht spielbar macht. VALLETTA ist simpel, schnell erklärt, spielt sich fluffig, lieb und tut überhaupt nicht weh. So kann man sich mit diesem Subgenre vertraut machen. Unter dem Strich bleibt jenseits von Deckbau in der Sendung mit der Maus nichts an dem man sich groß reiben und aufreiben könnte. Konsens bezahlt eben immer den Preis, das es den kleinsten Nenner bedient, der hier womöglich eine breitere Zielgruppe auf beginnendem "Kennerspielniveau" bedienen soll. Ob der jedoch wiederum mit der Hauptstadt Maltas dann thematisch abgeholt wird, bleibt das einzig Außergewöhnliche in einem Spiel, das in seiner eigenen Nettigkeit nicht über sich selbst als Einführungsspiel hinauskommt. Das gefällt mir aber immer noch besser als der unkindliche, erwachsene  Rechenschieber des HiG-Jahrgangspartners FIRST CLASS. Die historischen Erklärungen zu den Geschichtsfiguren Maltas sind auch sehr nett.

Nice take on the deckbuilding mechanic, but sadly the game is plain boring. There's no arc of suspense and nothing interesting you do. You just play cards to get resources and cards to use them for buildings (netting you new cards). I like the concept and the game works well, but it's missing everything else.

RATING: 3
- Twice as long as most other deck builders with no payoff

- Starting player advantage is pretty big, because of earlier access to the limited "good" cards and a very probable extra turn in the end

- Runaway leader problem coupled with the feeling, that everybody does roughly the same to score points, which is quite an achievement

- Visually one of the most boring games I've played

- Card drawing luck is way more important than in other deck builders, because cards often don't work on their own, but in a combination with another card and you're kinda stuck if you shuffled that one important card to the bottom of your deck.

- Thinning out your deck is very limited, because only one card (which is at least in your starting deck) has that ability.

For me this game lacks balance, the game is about claiming buildings to which only you have access, these have powers, most are harmless and expand on building abilities, however there are a couple which allow you to attack other players supplies, each building can only be claimed by one player so the player that ends up with the aggressive buildings gets to attack with impunity the other players. Other than this though the game works, some nice simple mechanics which slot together nicely.

Valetta ist ein Deckbuilder mit einem extra Kniff. Man zieht auf 5 Karten auf, spielt in einer Runde aber nur 3 Karten aus. Mit diesen Karten kann man neue Häuser kaufen, die einem die Arbeiter, die darin wohnen ins Deck bringt. Diese Karten bringen Ressourcen, Siegpunkte oder mit ihnen kann man weitere Häuser bauen.

Das Spiel weiss zu gefallen und macht auch Spaß, aber es ist mir auch etwas zu "einfach".
Jeder versucht eigentlich in der Reihe zu bauen, in der der Stadtherr gerade steht, weil es dafür 2 Extrapunkte gibt. Das ist schön für die Interaktion, aber es wird dadurch auch Focusierter und man hat nicht mehr soooo die Auswahl an Möglichkeiten.
Wer nicht in die Reihe baut und die Extrapunkte mitnimmt hat gefühlt schon verloren.

Kind of a deck building game. But I was very frustrated on first play since the order in which cards come into your hand decide what you can do, and who gets the good buildings (cards) first.

A unique take on deckbuilding that focuses more on strategic options than most in the genre, both in terms of engine building and considering territory control.

I really enjoy the streamlined design.  The deck building is smooth; not clunky at all, like some deck builders.  The deck building really just feels like a twist on action selection.  And then I also enjoy the tight resource management.  You have to constantly evaluate which cards you want to pick up, and then make sure you're gathering the right resources, at the right time, to do so!  A straightforward game that's lots of fun!

(+) Simple game to teach and play, yet some potential for tactical and strategic play

(+) Different set-up each game, increasing replayability

(+) Some minor engine building combined with some puzzle elements and a deck-building / hand management mechanisms. They link well together to keep the game interesting

(-) The game feels pretty bland: there is little to no integration between theme and gameplay elements. You could say this game lacks some 'soul'.

(-) Player order issue: it is highly likely that the last player in play order (determined randomly) gets less moves and he'll have to cope with diffucult competition in obtaining crutial first cards.

(-) Some annoying randomness; getting an extra opportunity for scoring an interesting yellow point-scoring card can mean a very significant difference in end score and this boils down to luck (-> drawing the card early from a blind deck at the final stage of the game).

Deck builder with small cards - a bad combination right from the start.  Gain resources to buy buildings to gain more resources to buy better buildings.  Rinse and repeat.  Boring.

1 play, 4er

The game is sort of like El Dorado, but with more gamer-y board play. Everyone starts with the same deck of cards (representing different people in the city), which you cycle through by playing 3 cards per turn (out of a hand of 5). You acquire new cards into your deck/hand by either buying them from a market (a very limited supply of builders only, until players start firing people), or taking them from the "board". The board is actually a random grid of buildings/people; when you spend the resources to build the building, you take the attached person (card) into your hand. People (cards) are in several colors and can do a bunch of things such as give you resources or points, allow you to build/upgrade buildings (maybe at a discount), hire someone, take stuff from other players, etc. There's also some spatial board play stuff: bonus VP for building in a specific row of the grid and building cost discounts for building in adjacent locations.

Pretty enjoyable, actually, but not good enough to be a keeper for me (too many excellent, unplayed games out there!).

Interesting deckbuilder with Euro-mechanics.  After playing it 3 times in one day, I found myself feeling like there wasn't much more that I'd want to do with it.  It has interesting choices, but it is mechanically and thematically dry.  I'd much rather play a deckbuilder with the capacity for big, amazing plays.  Valletta's mechanics make sure this would never happen.  

Community says best with 4.  I can't help but think this is total nonsense.  Like most deckbuilders, play it with 3.

RATING: 6
A deckbuider with an interesting twist to it. It also adds a spatial element to it where you want to recruit (build) in clusters with a timing aspect as well.

It is a game of tempo where you want to build at the right places at the right time and before your opponents get there. But when you combine this with being a deckbuilder at the mercy of the card draw order you can lose or gain a lot of points depending on luck.

The game incentivizes the player to plan ahead and gather resources for a specific building cost but at the same time has cards which steal resources from other players. This steal can set the player back in tempo quite a bit and I do not care for it in a game like this.

Finally the start player advantage is substantial. Players early in turn order are likely to have an additional 3 actions (1 round) before end game scoring. Also they get first pick of all the buildings which is a big advantage as each building can only be built once and some are just better than others in early game.

tl;dr: solid engine builder

This game is an engine building game that also has a deck building aspects. now deck building is a sort of engine building mechanism by itself, but this game also adds buildings on the table that determine what resources you can generate. The combinations of these elements works very well.
On your turn you get to play 3 of your 5 hand cards, then you refill to 5. Cards that you gain during your turn go into your hand. Both those things are small tweaks to the standard deck building stuff we're used to. They work well for this game. There's also a timer element with a meeple waling along a track, but there are other things that can end the game. I think in most games one player will build all their buildings.
Every now and then you could end up holding cards you can't use. If you're having 'build' action cards and you don't have the resources, then you'll be forced to waste your cards and actions. This can be bad and could put you at a disadvantage. Good planning advised.
I quite liked this and hope to play this again.

RATING: 7
I'd never heard of this game before. Or maybe I had and had immediately forgotten the bland cover/title. Seriously, there's nothing on this box that would have encouraged me to try this game.

In the game the "board" is a series of building spaces which are covered by a card. These spaces all reference some number of coins, stone, brick or wood. There's also a central track where "Monsier Purple" (I don't remember his name) advances along the track. The game ends either when he hits the end of the track or when someone builds their last building.

You have a deck of cards. You draw up to five cards and then play three of them on your turn. You keep the remaining cards for the next round. Eventually you'll cycle through your entire deck, when you shuffle up and repeat this process.

Most of the cards you start with aren't so great. Get a wood, get a stone, get a brick, get your choice of wood/stone/brick/coin, build/upgrade a building, copy a previous card (with limitations), or advance Mr. Purple.

When you advance Mr. Purple, you reveal a token and get the matching good. You also have the opportunity to get a card from the discard pile (which starts with some cards in it) or purge a card from your deck. Where Mr. Purple is also gives a scoring bonus to any buildings built/upgraded in that column (the English rules omit the upgrade bit).

Building a building means paying the coins and goods for the building, scoring points if it is in the column Mr. Purple is in, taking the card from that building (which goes into your hand) and marking the building with one of your six houses. There's a buck discount for every adjacent house you've already built. Every building has some symbol at the bottom which is relevant as many cards key off how many symbols you have. The cards you get tend to produce resources (green), score points (yellow) or have cool powers (blue). Buildings also give points.

Upgrading a building requires paying the cost again, though not the coin cost. And you score points if Mr. Purple is in the correct column (although we didn't actually do this in our play). The building tile flips, doubling the symbols and points on the card.

Most of the cards you can add to your deck either give you a good for each of the appropriate matching symbols on your buildings, give you better ways to get multiple goods, steal goods from other players, or give you points (all sorts of ways).

Once the end of game is triggered, you shuffle your discard pile into your draw pile and the game continues until everyone has played out their entire deck.

This game was a lot of fun. I do wonder if much of the game is decided by the layout of buildings and the early builds players make. I want to try this again and see if it feels samey or not.

An engine builder using cards. Also, a lot of resource management. Didn't really feel like much of a deck builder because using actions to improve or cull your deck meant you didn't use that action to build or upgrade a building, which is very valuable in the game it terms of collecting resources and getting vps.

Everything it does it does extremely well. Deck building is quick and easy to grasp and all the deck building wants lie deck thinning are baked right in. Also 3 easy to see end game triggers make it play fast.

An evolution of deck building. Throw in resource management and a few other twists and it's a refreshing take on the genre.

City and deck building hybrid.  Buying upgradable buildings provide bonuses and discounts as well as adding laborers, artisans, or banker worker cards to your deck to play for resources, goods and coin. A significant part of this dual strategy comes from the random startup distribution and frequency of the building types with their corresponding worker with when and where to build and what to emphasize in your deck building. I like that acquired cards go to hand for immediate use. I also like the multi-use effect of the Valette card and the doubling use of the apprentice card.  Interesting adaptation and challenge for a deckbuilder although it is a tad dry.

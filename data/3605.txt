GAME: The Third World War
RANK: 1877
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
one of the best game on the subject, but in spite of many armored and mecanised divisions on both sides, a battle overall static begining with the second or third week. Good system, specially for the air war, clean and simple mechanisms.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The definitive game and series on the third world war. This is Game 1 in the Third World War series and is a real treat for treadheads, as the massed armoured might of NATO and the Warsaw Pact slug it out in Central Europe. The game / series uses an asymmetric turn sequence (be warned, it's long!) to reflect the then-supposed deliverables between NATO and Warsaw Pact troops. The mechanics blend air, airmobile and land movement and combat together well - but the naval module never came out, so there's a gap there. But the rules that are there are comprehensive and cover things like runway cratering, NBC warfare and Pact logistical breakdown. 
Each formation is rated for attack, defence and effectiveness; combat odds are affected by differences in formation effectiveness, airpower and terrain. 
This game forms the introduction to the series. Once you have the other games in the series, you can start to make the big theatre-level judgements: where to send reinforcements; how to allocate airpower between air superiority, strike and ground support; and when to create and deploy reserves. 
The designer's notes are some of the best I've seen too. This is also great as a stand-alone game as well.

RATING: 7
Probably the game in the series I've played least, due to time constraints and counter density.  I find when I play it I always want to be the other player - as the PACT I envy the A-10s, and as NATO I envy the tank divisions.  Well balanced.  Love the abstract way the air units' ranges and bases are handled.  For me the air war is the most fun part of the series.

RATING: 9
When combined with it's three other companion games a really good easily played 'monster' just made for two players per side...a relatively small number of turns is fleshed out with a HUGE  assymmetrical sequence of play where players get to move several times in a reflection of the overall strategic situation and the assumed doctrines of the protagonists...a small card driven 'diplomatic' show down gets the game started in a postulated Middle East crisis (where else?) and the conflict spreads quickly to Europe where it's all hands on deck as the Warsaw Pact invades en masse...nukes are available but tend to dominate game play when used...

RATING: 7.75
Just set up a combined Battle for Germany/Southern Front and playing the Soviets. The sequence of play takes a bit of getting down, but it is looking good. Much quicker and smoother system than say SPI's Next War. This could be on the table for a while...

One of my very best gaming experiences.  Superb system.  Superb play and replay value.  Best game was 3WW + SF.  (Arctic Front took too much space and not enough action, and Persian Gulf irrelevant to classic mid-late 70's/early 80's time frame.)  Pact broke thru Yugo into Po Valley, raced almost to Milan, but there the Eye-Ties dug in and Pact ran out of steam.  Central Front was also a nail-bitter with my NATO air rolling endless 6's giving Pact chance to drive dangerously deep into GY, but finally Pact stalled there, too.  But what a hoot to play.  Have also played SF alone many times, short(ish)playable, violent, great for aging grognards.

RATING: 5
Each player needs to play in a different way to make the most of their capabilities and to spoil your opponents game.  I am particularly keen on the games air rules.

Produces some really close games.

The supply and command and controls rules are lacking.  Cutting off a stack of US divisions does not impact their capabilities enough.  A better set of supply/isolation rules would have add value.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

Acquired the whole series as trade bait, but never tried it until "forced" to in a game club.

Fantastic simulation of 1980's NATO/WP conflict in Europe. The Soviet player has to use the impulse system correctly in order to achieve and exploit breakthroughs otherwise NATO will hold the line relatively easily. The air war is the best part of the game for myself and my regular opponents, unfortunately the Su-27's and the F-15's tend to shoot each other down rather quickly. When combined with the other games in the series, it adds a whole new dimension to the gameplay. The rules are easy to learn and are clearly presented. The isolation and supply rules though are a little too unrealistic.

This was an interesting game at the time it game out.  A playable wargame covering the European theatre.  I got a few solo plays in at the time and it was fun.

It linked up with one or two other games in a series, but I never had those.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Brilliant series, highly recommended for anyone interested in potential NATO vs Warsaw Pact hypothetical.  In fact its my favorite game of all time.

This is the 1st game in the series and a must own.  If you only own one game in this great series, this is the one.  This is the main event of the series where the war is won or lost.   Most of the NATO and SOVIET power is concentrated here and this is where most of the points are in the combine 4 game campaign.  The game is very flexible and very open ended with lots of strategies viable and makes for a very replayable game.

When combined with the other games, the series shines with all its strategic elements and still remaining totally playable.

RATING: 6
A great theme but the play can bog down a bit. The air war game was unique for it's time, and provides a good representation of what a NATO/Warsaw Pact air war could be like, but it really slows down play and detracts from the ground maneuver element. Keeping track of unit disruptions and the math needed to do so (averaging stacks of counters?) is a big negative in my opinion and also detracts from the presentation of the game. Still fun to play, but there are better options out there.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent and enjoyable game even if it is a bit dated.
Gets a little bit cumbersome when dealing with disruption markers that permanently plague the Soviet forces once they start taking damage.
Pact forces can stand toe to toe with NATO forces including the US, but Pact air power is almost litterally swept from the sky after a couple of turns.
All in all an outstanding game, even if it lacks versatility.

This is a fine war-game, although it is a bit odd playing hypothetical wars that failed to happen. It is a bit tough on the Soviets, probably a fair call. If the Soviets don't catch a break or two in the air war they will really get in trouble.

RATING: 7
Good: Strategic/Operational - WW III - Medium

Plus:
-Great theme
-This is really an incredible system: so much going on, yet so few rules; the trademark of a great design. 
-Pact & NATO have assymetric turn orders!
-The shaken / demoralized tables are a great feature
-Great air rules

Minus:
-Looks horrible, even for 80's standards. It shows there was a tight budget and it could use pimping
-Playing The full game with it's 3 extensions is virtually impossible due to amount of space. 
-No naval action whatsoever but I can imagine as it would distract too much from the core which is the landwar.
-Scale: I prefer the scale NATO: next war in Europe. For the European theatre the scale is too big.

The land unit combat is as straight forward as can be, however, the sequence of play is quite unique: asymatric forces as well as sequence for Pact & Nato but most interesting (and the most complex part of the game) is the ariwarfare where you can assign units to all types of missions such as: combat support, runnawy cratering, logistical constraint and ofcourse interception. This mechanic ensures great tension and depicts the difference the different parties have to face. 
Burning your fighterbombers too early will cause havoc later in the turn

Good stuff but the scale and horrific map graphics hamper a higher rating. 

I got a good offer and decided to sell.

A fascinating game of the Cold War's great What If?  The game is very innovative with an asymetrical sequence of play that plays up the use of reserves and refitting units on both sides.

best when played together with sister games Arctic Front and Balkan Front. Felt like Persian Gulf broke the system, as the oil fields were worth more than all the cities of Europe. Really liked the air rule system, with the random recovery rate, allowing the Sovs to get one good air assault off early, and then to have to make the decision to try to contest the skies with nato, or wait three turns until they could mass again. rating lowered somewhat due to random die roll at the beginning of the game allowing nato units to get to the front line. this made too big a difference on the result.

A favorite theatre for me, this is the best of the NATO vs Warsaw Pact games that I have played. The rules are not complex or filled with exceptions...but they can get fairly detailed. The way air-power interacts with the ground forces, and the that the two armies behave so differently, really over-flows my grognard cup with cardboard pushing goodness. Also note how the big cities bog down the fast-moving Warsaw Pact player, which seems about right. Big, mobile, Pact units blowing holes in the NATO lines and flowing reserves through the gap, regional infantry holding the line with massive NATO air support, U.S. units forming hedgehog defensive positions...perfect!

RATING: 8
Vol.1 of the GDW's classic "Third World War" game system.  The theatre is perceived to be the one most likely exposed to Soviet military threat -- North German Plain.  The war could never materialize now.  But the game still pose a valid question as to what if.....    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of GDW's best. Unique system that is very playable and great in encapsulating differences in doctrine and quality.  Bit sad to see the pro-American bias frequent in those days - the F-111 gets a 5 strike rating and the Tornado with essentially the same capability, payload and range gets a 2.

RATING: 10
Simply exceptional. One of the best integration of grand opertaional land and air warfare who still mamange to be playable and fast. Battle for Germany is a must have game ofr any NATO-WARPAC enthusiast. 
While the system is still a basic Igo-Ugo the introduction of reserve movement and the differences in Nato and Soviet segment (the Soviet are less flexible, but they enjoy the ability to push more in attack)  creates a tense Sequance of play and the efficiency rating of each unit add a new dimension to the combat system. Here you can hope to stem quantity with quality and the special rules for Airmobile units and US Division 86 formations clearly show the diffenrences in doctrine.

Featuring a brilliant operational level air system, this game is one of the classics from the 80s and still holds up well today, despite the world having moved on from this topic.  Probably one of the first games to rate U.S. divisions accurately in terms of the firepower and took into account the varying unit sizes of all of the participants.  The only thing that you can legitimately complain about are the disruption markers, which look ungainly on all the stacks halfway through each game.  This system is also highly suitable for group play.

RATING: 9.8
Frank Chadwick’s The Third World War was published in 1984 by Game Designer’s Workshop, and sets out to simulate a hypothetical conflict taking place in the early 90s in Europe.  To try and make this scenario seem plausible Chadwick describes in his briefing booklet the idea behind the game.

As Chadwick makes clear, the idea of the Warsaw Pact attacking Western Europe in the latter part of the 20th century for expansionist reasons makes no sense as their chances of success were much better in the 50s and 60s.  Instead another catalyst is needed to show why the Warsaw Pact would invade Europe.  To that end Chadwick has devised a scenario around the collapse of Iran after the death of the Ayatollah Khomeini.  NATO fears an oil rich Soviet client state in the Gulf region and the Soviets fear a strong NATO presence on their southern border.  Both sides want to install a friendly government in Iran and a shooting war develops.  This is depicted in The Persian Gulf one of the games in this series, but this review will focus on The Third World War which deals with central Europe.  Massed Warsaw Pact forces in East Germany, Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia pour across the border and attack the NATO forces primarily concentrated in West Germany.  What happens next is in your hands!

The game itself is not terribly complex, but don’t be fooled into thinking it’s simple.  There is a lot going on and both players need to be paying attention at all times.  The standard game lasts for eight turns, with each turn representing a week.  Each turn is broken down into segments and impulses.  One of the major features of this is that Warsaw Pact forces have four combat phases in a turn and NATO forces three, but NATO reserve troops can move in the middle of the Warsaw Pact segment of the turn.  This is a neat way of showing the Pact’s reliance on offensive action as well as NATOs superior flexibility.

In essence the mechanics of the game are quite straight forward and this is the genius of the design.  Chadwick hasn’t tried to reinvent the wheel too much, instead he has taken fairly familiar wargaming concepts and moulded them into a sequence of play that highlights doctrinal differences between the forces without creating pages and pages of chrome.

This extends to things like modelling the air war.  It’s easy to develop quite complex rules to try and show the effects of airpower on ground combat (See for example the Next War), but instead Chadwick uses some abstraction to come up with a highly playable system that still tries to reflect some of the realities of the situation.

Each player will use their air status charts to show which hair units are available to be flown, which have flown, which have been grounded, which shot down and which are flying air superiority missions.  Warsaw Pact units are placed first to reflect the better NATO AWACS capability.  Having air superiority allows a side to fly two units for each air superiority mission instead of one.  You can fly different types of air missions with your units as long as they are rated for the type of mission you want them to fly.  The missions are:

•	Ground attack - support ground attacks with aircraft
•	Strike - attack your opponents supply lines, runways to ground aircraft or moving units.
•	Air superiority - Escort friendly strike missions, intercept enemy strike missions and use top cover to protect friendly ground attacks or attack enemy ground attacks.
 While quite straight forward this abstraction of the uses of air craft still provides plenty to think about.  As the NATO player places units second it is hard for the Warsaw Pact to gain air superiority but it is worth it if they can achieve it especially in the first turn.

The real art of this game is getting all the different systems working together.  This is especially true for the Warsaw Pact who has to hit the ground running and can’t afford to make many mistakes.  Working out how and when to launch your attacks, and how to support them, and then follow them up will certainly take more than one game to get right.

In conclusion The Third World War is a very playable simulation of a Warsaw Pact attack on NATO.  The rules are quite short for a game of this nature but it provides a challenging and interesting game for both sides.  Well worth getting and this game comes highly recommended for anyone who is interested in this hypothetical situations.  A definite keeper.

Even if the game employs classic hex-n-counter system, some mechanics may seem counter-intuitive: Battered units losing proficiency instead of strenght? Air units made by 100 aircraft of the same type?? But, at the end, the result is bigger than the sum of all its parts. I have played it to death, both as NATO and WP, and both within at least a game of the "supercombo" which includes all the titles of the series (Norway + Central Europe + Balkans/E.Med + Persian Gulf). A bit clunky by today's standards, but one of the best games I ever played.

The game system does a good job of distinguishing the different strategies of the two sides: quantity vs quality.  Use of airpower is critical, especially since the massing of forces is critical to obtaining any kind of breakthrough.  A great game by itself, much more fun with the expansions.

Excellent game with a set of rules that are easy to follow and can be learnt by heart. Have played several games recently trying out different allocations of Divisions to the different theatres. The Soviets usually take most of West Germany by end turn 8. I need to try some different tactics for NATO !

I haven't played this in YEARS, but I remember having a great time with it.  I have the entire series boxed up in the attic, waiting for my children to get old enough that I don't fear loss of bits.

Excellent game. My favorite operational level game and certainly my favorite WW3 game. The only defect is some unrealistic values. But other than that this is a sublime game.

After 30 years of war gaming ... TWW is one of my best gaming experiences. It´s a better game alone than together with AF or SF

Does a very good job of giving a sense of the irresistable force vs. immovable object that characterized much of the soviet vs. nato thinking at the time.  The air combat is a fun game within the game.

I have really fond memories of playing this series.  TWW was the best of the four.  It is still a fun game and great design by Chadwick.

No SW unpunched from 1984 in all it's glory, box has shelf-wear slight dishing, original owner just never got it to the table

The core game of a four game system.  I love the combat system and chrome, and they're very intuitve and easy to understand.  Emphasis is placed on unit proficiency, and the gradual depletion thereof, ratherr than just hitting power.  The two sides had very different combat characteristics beyond simply comparing combat factors.  I'm not a big hypothetical wargamer, but I did really like the system.  I do recall it taking a long time and being "fiddly" with lots of extra marker counters (nothing like ASL in this regard though).

Finally played at GameOn! Con, absolutely hooked, one of those games that rewards repeated plays in order to learn the depth of strategy. Love it.  Only quibble: would love to see an accurate, hisorical OOB, as opposed to the conjecture from open source intel that this obviously portrays.

This one has stood the test of time.  Its only flaw is its God-awful map.  Terrible, really, but the game system more than makes up for it.

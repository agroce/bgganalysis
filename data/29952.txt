Feels solvable and is probably more of a memory game than anything. Very well produced, though!

5 in a row abstract - twist is you can move the board around hiding and revealing bits, so there is a memory element and the opportunity to lay 'traps' for your opponent. Wasn't overwhelmed with it, there are other abstracts I'd rather play.

impression:  quick 2p abstract with sub-board movement.  expensive (as it's sold from Europe).

RATING: 7
A really fun abstract two-player that takes the simple connect 4 (or in this case 5) type of games and literally spins them on their head. You can either place a disc on your turn or you can move the various sections of the pyramid around or you can rotate sections, covering your opponents pieces, revealing past plays, and creating new options to make your line of 5 discs! Fun stuff and plays pretty quickly as well! Also the components are very nice wooden components!

Rating based on one play.  Nifty abstract with beautiful production values, plays quickly.  I can see where this would get addictive!

A good abstract game of trying to connect five in a row. There is a little too much memory involved for my liking. The multi layer sliding and rotation can definitely make one´s head spin.

Excellent abstract that can be explained in seconds and played with anyone from my kids to my grandparents.  My 6 y.o. enjoys abstracts and didn't want to stop playing this when we first broke it out.  I'd like to try against a more challenging partner too, but for now I'm happy to play against her and watch her develop her spatial reasoning.  Fun game, nice production values (though my 5x5 board is slightly warped).

A good idea, a 'n-in-a-row' with a shifting landscape, but I think Pentago pulled it off much better and much more cleanly. The fact that pieces get hidden can make for a memory based game which can be fun sometimes (see: Gobblet).

Played the prototype; a really clever design, fascinating to play.  I am looking forward to getting a copy.  Update 23OCT07:  I now own a copy and despite playing hundreds of demonstration games at Essen I still feel the urge to play.

2008 acquisition.

This is a nice little 2-player fller abstract game.  It is basically a game of connect 5 with a board that is constantly changing.  Having a good memory is a distinct advantage as it can be hard remembering where you put your counters after the boards have been moved a few times.

RATING: 9
I'm biased as I helped to develop and playtest this game. However I do believe that it is a good game of its type, which will provide a quick filler at the start or end of a session, or it can be used as a family game to intoduce non-gamers to the hobby. 

The rules are simple, the components are good quality, the game is portable, and replay value is high. I took a prototype version to my games club and it was well received by thoe who tried it. One member there is a huge Tantrix fan and she was of the opinion that if it was available at a Tantrix convention then attendees would look forward to playing it. 

I rarely play 2-player games, so I can't rate it as a 10, but I would readily play it between heavier, longer games. 

Quick to learn, not easy to master.

RATING: 8
An Essen2007 gem. The rotating and shifting boards mechanic is great.

Update after some more games: The harsh starting advantage of the basic game is reduced when using the "top board forbidden for each player who has not placed a piece in every other level" variant.

RATING: 7
Very quick 2-player game that has that connect-four feel going (it's actually "connect 5") but played with the third dimension, so there is an actual simple depth here than Connect Four does not have.

RATING: 5
Neutral - on occasion

Not bad, too brain-burner for me.

RATING: 6
Pretty nifty!  Here is a much better version of connect four.  Actually it reminds me a lot more like a convoluted version of Pente but in a good way. A nice fast game too.  

I do find it VERY difficult to remember the hidden pieces and this makes it a bit of a pain. You either play by strict rules and make mistakes or always have to take move things to try and see your pieces.

Nice abstract with the usual "place a pawn to create a 5-in-a-row" is coupled with the unusual "move (part of) the board" rather than the pawns.
Quick.

Interesting little abstract. Just as Gipf this is the kinda game Connect Four should have been.

Plays quite fast which also makes it a nice filler. 

Comes in a wooden box. The wooden design of the game looks quite nice & inviting.Good design, nice brain burner, worth getting for fans of abstracts. The only flaw I could find is that the wooden levels lay loose on top of each other which makes gameplay just a little too fiddly for the general "Connect Four" audience.

This looks fairly promising, I will be happy when somebody around here has one to try.

Interesting connect-5 game with boards that move 360°.  You can play a piece or shift a board 90° (as long as you are not simply cancelling out your opponent's last move).  The shifted boards reveal new spaces for pieces to be placed and eventually it can become a memory game.  If you're like me you may find it difficult to keep track of where pieces are once boards have been shifted multiple times.  It's not uncommon late in the game for somebody to move a board only to discover that they've now lost.  Having played this a few times it's very clear that you don't want to be on the defensive.  Otherwise while you're trying to shift out of sticky situations your opponent is constantly adding more pieces to the boards.

Only played it on boardspace, but really dig it. Hard to breathe new life into the N-in-a-row genre but the combination of moving boards, and memory makes this a really great little game.

Rating could go either way.  Most alignment games of this type have a forced result which become clear after a few plays.  Only time will tell if this is an exception.

15Apr08--Thanks for the GoF loot, Bobby4th! I look forward to playing. 22Apr08--I would give it a 6 except that they didn't put the name on the box. It's a nice, little wood crate with a picture of the board on it, but no name. Let's hope I remember the name if I lose the rules. So that's a minor frustration. The major frustration was realizing that one player could play completely defensively and accidentally win. I loved the idea of the constantly moving board until I was one move away from winning for about seven turns in a row. I was afraid if I twisted the board one more time I would uncover a five-in-a-row for Bobby4th.

A wonderful abstract strategy game...puts Pentago to shame with its simplicity and yet its complexity! My wife really does not like abstract strategy, but this one she will request to play...Yaaaay!

RATING: 8
Played three times with a friend who likes abstracts. We both liked it, me perhaps more than he. Repeat play made it obvious that the topmost level is of clear strategic importance, as a result our best and tightest game came when using the variant (in the rules) of having to have a piece on all other levels before being allowed to place up top.

*** 10 Dec 07
After further play we realized we'd forgotten about being able to rotate the boards - thus neutering much of the top board advantage since all four spaces are probably similarly useful.  Rating has been upped to suit.

A very interesting connect 5 game, but it doesn't feel dynamic enough to provide a sufficiently different playing experience after a few games.  Good idea, decent execution, but it feels like it's missing . . . something.

RATING: 8
A very fun, clever twist on the five-in-a-row concept, as you try to line up five tokens on a multilayered playing field. Agonizing decisions -- do I place a piece or turn/move the board to block? -- and a quick playing length. Combines some of the best elements of Pentago and Gobblet. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar to Pentago in terms of goal and rules (tic-tac-toe for 5 in a row with moving board squares) but more complex strategy.  I liked it more than I thought I would, and found myself wanting "just one more play".

However there is a practical problem about the covered-up spaces - is Quinamid meant to be a memory game (in which case you can accidentally see hidden information when rotating levels) or not (in which case it's a pain in the ass to see what's hidden under the levels)?  I was surprised that the rules are silent on this, and the designer/manufacturer hadn't thought about this issue.

Abstract, Connection. Great quick abstract game, very happy with this one. Not complicated, but nice blend of planning, maneuvering and memory. Too bad I can't seem to win a game, heh.

Plays are logged per "match" usually consisting of 2 or 3 games in a row.

Ended up trading it in favor of other abstracts I like better like the GIPF games. I only have so much room for abstracts on my shelf.

I bought this game at "SPIEL 2007" in Essen. For 25 EUROS (=36$) it was not cheap. But I am happy that I bought it. It is one oft the best "5 in a row" games I ever played.

Fun little game. Almost a pub game realy as it suits a relaxed friendly atmosphere. You'd probably not play it all night unless you get really tactical and treat it like chess but it's a great quick game to warm up or fill in those gaps waiting for every one else to roll up at a session. Probably not your bag if you always lost at Noughts 'n' Crosses though as it can be frustrating !! Makes a nice change from traditional draughts or chess for the non-gamers in family who are more apt to baulk at anything you can't buy in Argos*Argo being a UK high street retailer that do the usual Monopaly, Cluedo etc...

A well produced, compact wooden abstract game of 5-in-a-row, but with the option of rotating or sliding a plane instead of placing a piece. Not the sort of game I normally seek out, but it's perfect for certain situations.

I highly recommend Quinamid; from the quality components to the simple yet engaging rules, this is one of the best games of 2007 - and easily one of my favorite two-player abstract games. When using the variants, it can become rather deep, yet never so overwhelming as to cause me to dislike it. A two-player game that I can enjoy with my wife, children, or a friend who drops by, Quinamid will likely never leave my collection - an exceptional game.

A pseudo-3D/2.5D connect five game with a stack of boards that can be manipulated (either by rotating or sliding) to change the orientation of the pieces.  While the idea is clever, however, it does seem to run into the problem of feeling rather scripted (especially the opening moves) a lot of abstracts fall prey to.  Was not able to hold my interest for long after several plays.  Decent, but unlikely to be asked for again.

Played my first games against my wife, who beat me soundly! I think I won 3 out of 12!
Lots of strategy although the starting moves seems to be consistent (racing for the 2x2 topmost tile).
Probably more fun than Pentago over the long run, more on tht later.

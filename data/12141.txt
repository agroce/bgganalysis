My favorite game using my favorite system.  Not as off the tracks in history as the meeting engagement at Gettysburg and more interesting command arrangements make this just a bit better than This Hallowed Ground.  Of course not abbreviating the Starkweather counter helps a lot too.

The best of the first three RSS/CWR games, IMO, because of the situation it portrays. More flexibility for the commands than Gettysburg (THG) or Shiloh (AFS). Plus, I just have a fondness for the western battles.

Great game to play. I agree 100% with Adam.

Note to Lawrence Hung: Have you played the game? Or, do you just feel a need to comment? If so, what is your basis for your comments? Do you understand the system? Just curious.

Very detailed tactical game, this was the best representation of Civil War Combat at this scale. The command system is elegant and gives the game a powerful feeling of realism. Because of it's size best with a team of players. But there are several shorter scenarios for 2 or less...(note this system has evolved into new Line of Battle Series...as such I have reduced the rating here. In reality when I will play this game again, it will be with the new LOB rules)

Regimental Sub-Series (RSS) games on American Civil War.  An ambitious project that try to bring the war on par with Europa on WW2.  The result is mixed.  Some like it while some don't -for the same reasons: huge maps, thousands counters and the troop order system.

RATING: 8
Awesome game which is a brilliant companion to the book by Peter Cozzens of the same name, and of course the designer's own three volume The Chickamauga Campaign.

The Line of Battle rules make this playable in a way that it might not otherwise have been (at least for me).  The battle of Chickamauga comes to life - in all its insanity - on a beautiful map.  Not a small game.  Completing a campaign game of the three day battle would be an impressive achievement.

Great components, fun scenarios, full battle is massive, good for team play.  Really enjoyed reading all the historical commentary in the TTS special rules.  I like RSS better than the LoB rules.

Huge, beautiful game.  Rules are a mess because you first have to learn CWB system, then modify them for this game.  Lots of record keeping and written orders, which makes it best suited for group play, though I have played it solo and against 1 player successfully.  Rather predictable, at least in the beginning turns.  Still, a gem.

This system is very detailed, but requires a strong commitment from players. This would be a great game for a small group of players. I love the entire package, it's a bit like owning a book on the battle with great maps, and I'd like to play out the complete battle, but no opportunity thus far. Be warned -- the system is not super complex, but it's not for the faint of heart.

I like the RSS much more than its parent CWBS.  Part of it is its more monstrous scale, part is the more refined system of strength.  Call me crazy, but I like strength represented by numbers more than a system of additive letters.  Tons of good scenarios here, too.  And the terrain makes for a interesting situation.

This one is HUGE.  6 maps and over 1,000 counters equals lots of scenarios and chances to play around with variants.  There is a lot going on with plenty of scenarios to keep you playing for a while, you just need to find the space is all.

the detail in the CWB/RSS system is immense -- it's gigantic, but worth the effort.  Comparisons between Europa and RSS are based on what?  Sheer size?

Played solo once. Decided to sell this when LoB development was announced. There may never be an LoB version of this battle. Oops.  The LoB system does look to be an improvement over RSS, though.

I confess I haven't played this yet. But it will be my choice for our monster gaming club when my time comes. Rating based on having played RSS rules for South Mountain and nearly the entire collection of the CWB games. I have also played Last Chance and None But Heroes in the LoB system. 

And while Dean marvelously achieved exactly what he intended with that system (speed and playability) compared to the admittedly deeper, slower RSS system, I have found I prefer RSS.  This is due to the abstractions Dean went for in LoB, most notably in the Command Rules. I prefer the more detailed command system base applied in CWB and am willing to give up speed of play in trade. That said, the advancement in LoB with its interactive movement, firing and assault is quite enjoyable over the traditional IGOUGO of CWB/RSS. Yet I find I still prefer the RSS SOP. 

The crowning achievement IMHO of LoB is Dean's treatment of artillery. Disallowing artillery to stack with infantry or cavalry is spot on. It accomplishes the historical tactic of forcing players to actually support artillery with flanking/reserve infantry in order to protect this fragile arm at an closing enemy. I would have liked to see Dean go a bit further with this and either lower morale or create a modifier for the SHaken status for infantry in direct support of artillery (especially rear support) while under counter-battery fire as this was a place infantry feared being. But of course that would've added chrome (which Dean abhors without demonstration of need) and which I agree was not relevant to LoB. The good news is these new artillery stacking rules should easily be adaptable to RSS without any perceptible impact. As well, the rest of Dean's artillery advancements in LoB should adapt well too.

Finally, Chickamauga is a very confusing battle to understand for numerous reasons. I can't tell you how much more clear my understanding was of both the battle itself as well as the operation campaign preceding it from the retreat by Bragg from Tullahoma to Chattanooga by the reading of Dave Powell's "Chickamauga Campaign" volumes. And I would highly recommend it for what is sure to provide a greater enjoyment of this game.

CWB/RSS? LoB? As Cyrus proclaimed... "Its all our turf!"

The regimental scale is a little much for me -- I'd prefer to play the brigade-level Barren Victory game. But the game itself is fine.

As an immersive military sim this game is awesome  -- an experience not to be missed (even if you're time limits you to sitting in on part of a campaign game)

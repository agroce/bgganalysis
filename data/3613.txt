RATING: 7.5
This, along with the other add-ons, are a nice air combat game. Very workable and much better the Flight Leader. This would be the easier choice for people who cant choke down SPI's Air War.:)In the end, any board air simulation cannot compare to the lastest computer air simulations. No way, no how. So, unless you have a bit of nostalgia, there is no reason to get this.

I had a period of really being into air wargames which started initially with SPI's Air War. This game owes a lot to that design but seemed a bit cleaner and up to date.

I've played hundreds of games of Air Superiority/Air Strike/The Speed of Heat. I've got a huge three-ring binder with two copies of every Aircraft Data Card in it. It's about as comprehensive as Janes' All the World's Aircraft.

My rating reflects my feelings in the heyday of the game. Now, with Birds of Prey available (OK, in playtest), Air Superiority and Air Strike aren't on my "I'll play it!" list anymore.

Premiered the AIRPOWER modern jet combat series rules by J.D. Webster.  Far more playable and faster paced than SPI's AIR WAR, which is its closest competition.  Best of all, once the AIRPOWER rules are learned, it translates readily to the World War II air system, FIGHTING WINGS.  

It's been nearly a quarter century since this game came out and one wishes for an update to show the newer hardware and include contemporary scenarios.  But it's still great fun to play and most of the world's premier jet aircraft are included.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A good attempt at recreating "modern" jet air combat.  Intro rules are good, but once u start adding radar, missiles, etc... It really can bog down quickly.

Innovative chit orientation (diagonal) is a real nice touch, but a bit too much math for my tastes...an air combat game should move quickly, or at least more than this one.

Great coponents, and I love the scenarios.

"Air War" as designed by real crewdogs and not engineers/complexity geeks.  FWIW, this former F4 guy thinks this is probably the best "cardboard and paper" air game period.  Good combination of realism, and game play.  Highly recommend both the modules, and read JD's newsletters; as he was continually modifying the game.  However, it has the limfac of any boardgame, only works in 2 dimensions.  One really needs a computer sim to experience a bit of what air combat is like.

the "serious" modern air war simulation on the market. Not an exercise on modelling 3d space but a deep and truly researched model of air combat in the jet age.

Nevertheless I prefer the Speed of Heat, because air combat and bombing are integrated in one package.

Hello, I'm the designer, adding my opinion to a system now 18 years old...I designed this to be better and more playable than SPI's Air War.  In that I succeeded.  This was my first published game design, heck first design ever.  Sold over 10,000 copies world wide.  Not bad.  Those that got through the "then" radical departures in design, such as not being restricted to 60 degree facings by the grid were rewarded with a fun and fairly-realistic (at least tactically) design.  When combined with Air Strike, it provided an excellent survey of air combat in the jet age as envisioned in the 1980s.  I give it a 7 for its success and the fact that I feel it was better than anything else at the time...Flight Leader was too coarse and had an inapropriate scale. Not realistic either, played like Richtofen's War.  Give me my old Air Sup. any day.  Cheers.

The first Air combat game that got it right...later improved on by Speed of Heat. Introduced several innovations: Flight points that could used for horitzontal or vertical movement, 12 pt facing, turns based on planes ability to pull gees at a given speed and the alternating initiative movement. Best games were with Jets using the older limited missiles... as the newer all aspect missiles led to dice offs between missile and decoys

Played 8 times. A big improvement to Air War, far more accessible and plays quickly. Not for the uninitiated, as true air combat games are not for everyone. Still I did prefer Air War for some aspects that Air Superiority seemed to have simplified.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Detailed game of modern air combat (could be more detailed, believe it or not, but it would become unnecessarily so).  Other than the complexity, the only points some players don't seem to like about it are acutally essential to any air combat game (like altitude rules - even Top Gun had rules, although simple, concerning the altitudes of the aircraft involved, and Air Superiority is much better than Top Gun).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I struggled with SPI's Air War for a couple of years.  I wondered then, will anyone make a modern jet combat game that is detailed, yet playable?  My prayer was answered with J.D. Webster's Air Superiority.  In it, I found a game with enough technical flavor, yet could be played in an afternoon!  This game holds up well with the passage of time.  Recommend it to anyone with an interest in modern jet combat.

RATING: 8.5
A terrific game (esp. with the post-publication refinements to the system that appeared in J.D. Webster's Air Power newsletter).  Starting to get a bit long in the tooth now, and will be improved upon in the future, but it holds up remarkably well.  Vastly better than Air War or Flight Leader.

Bought the zip-lock edition directly from J D Webster, and I am looking into it, as an inspiration for my own ideas. The rules seem a bit rough around the edges compared to Whistling Death, but still present a feature-complete set of rules. 

Graphically, AS shows its age. The rules are well laid out, but the game could do with more modern graphics all around (I preferred its semi-contemporary, Flight Leader, for its graphic appeal, back in the 80'ies)

Two things the are very much in its favour are the 7 pages of descriptions of planes and missiles, and especially the just over 3 pages of briefing (combined tactics primer and designer's notes), where the basics of dogfighting and why the game is scaled as it is is explained

I expect Speed of Heat will be a more mature version of these rules. I would like to use some of the ideas from Whistling Death for better flight geometry, but don't know if it's practical.

Much, much more playable than the designers WWII air system (due to scale, 13.5 second turns here, instead of 4-second turns in WWII game).  Always enjoy playing this.

RATING: 6
A playable, yet detailed jet combat game.  In a way, Air War done right.  No other game that I've played matches the combination of detail, and fast moving game play (once you're familiar with the game mechanics).  Really enjoyed this game and also just looking over the data cards.  Bird of Prey might be the current equivalent.

Games can be quite fast given the lethality of modern missles.  Earlier eras like Vietnam and Korea are better from a gaming pov giving players much more scope to execute close quarters ACM with short range rear aspect missiles and guns (see Speed of Heat, which I never tried).  

If you're into computer games, Avalon Hill's Flight Commander 2 might be worth a look and is abandoware to boot.

While I was fascinated by this game, I played it a lot. We used some sort of impulse movement when playing, then we discovered how it was really played and it kinda felt like another game. It was fun, but long. Designing a good modern air combat game with a balance between the plausible and the play time must be a very difficult feat. Kudos to JD Webster. At that time this game competed with Flight Leader and Air War, the later being a very detailed, very looong game flying over boringland.

This is the game that got me hooked on JD Webster's designs.  Game was a step up from earlier efforts in this genre. Suffered from some inconsistencies and inaccuracies in data due to alot of data still being classified.  My game group heavily modified the game for our playings and until Fighting Wings series and Over the Reich was released. This was the definitive air combat game to play for modern air combat in the missile age.

First in the series. There is a bit of a learning curve, but definitely the best jet air combat board game that I have played. The next in the series is Air Strike, which handles air to ground combat. After that came an add-on module called Desert Falcons which updated the rules and included quite a bit of data on aircraft related to the Arab-Israeli conflicts of the past 50 years. It also gave the basic framework for a campaign game. The last release in the series, and the best IMHO was The Speed of Heat, which covered the Vietnam conflict, included numerous rules updates, new maps and new aircraft. Great games overall, but starting to get a bit dated.

GAME: San Juan
RANK: 224

RATING: 8
Fast and fun, the lighter version of Puerto Rico, also for non-gamers. It makes use of the well-know mechanics of the original boardgame, but adds less strategy and a bit more luck instead. Quick setup, so it's perfect as a filler. Great replayable value. The only thing I dislike: low interaction between players, expecially with 2 people it seems "only a run to build, the faster you can". However, awesome!

RATING: 7
San Juan takes what I appreciate of Puerto Rico and boils it down to a more streamlined and enjoyable form, playable in half the time. Simple and fast, it rewards strategy and tactics without becoming too much chess-like. Simpler and with less variety than Race for the Galaxy, it is also more elegant and accessible. Luck is present, but not to the point of making a mess of your strategy: even if not all the buildings seem to be balanced, it's really hard to be left without viable options. Interaction between players is still limited: you have to choose the role that maximizes your advantage and minimizes your rivals' gains, and keep a look at what paths they're following, but that's it. Really good with 3 players, still good with 2, less enjoyable with 4.

RGG version. Simple components, good quality.

Card version of Puerto Rico.  But much easier to play.  Each turn is not so critical and it is not so obvious if you have made a mistake.  Difficult to tell who is winning until the end.
Quick to play and quick to learn.
The more I play this the more I like it.

before Glory to Rome and Dominion this was my favourite 2 player card game. There are several strategies to win and you need to adopt one that suits the cards you draw. Some detractors say it is very luck based but this is like saying the same about Bridge

Just when the game is getting interesting, someone lays that last card and the game ends.  My husband and I prefer the Catan card game.

update: we have started playing this with our 6 y.o., and I find I like it better with three players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I loved how the cards could be used for multiple things (currency, buildings, production), and I adore variable phase selection (ala Puerto Rico, Glory to Rome). The theme isn't bad. The downside here mostly comes in the form of the end game; there are so few ways of ending the game, that you're options for winning strategies are somewhat narrow. Hands down best at 4p. I find I want to play about twice a year, otherwise I'd pick up it's cousin Glory to Rome instead.

I bought this instead of Race for the Galaxy (RftG). You can think of it as the offspring of RftG and Peurto Rico. The game is quick and has a lot of strategy. It also has some luck. My only complaint is that the Guild Hall / Indigo strategy used by my SO wins almost every game.

Card game version of Puerto Rico, I like it okay because of the speed of play.  unfortunately it is a little too dictated by luck for me to really enjoy, the player that draws the best combination of cards is always the winner.

RATING: 8
Essentially the card version of Puerto Rico, that stands alone as a very solid game in it's own right.

The excellent role selection mechanic of Puerto Rico is used here, with the innovative idea of the cards having several uses (money, goods, buildings).

This game is simple to pick up and play, and it works very well with 2-players.  However, if you have more than 2 players, I'd recommend playing Puerto Rico, unless space and/or time is an issue, as this game is very portable and reasonably quick.  It should also be noted that this is more of a "racing" game with 2-players, as the game ends once someone builds 12 buildings.

This is a strategy game, despite the fact that luck of the draw can be a significant factor, and some of the buildings can be very unbalanced at times (ex: Library, Guild Hall).

I'm not a huge fan of this game, but I respect it's solid design, and it gets played a TON around here, as my wife absolutely loves it.  Considering the quality and low cost of the game, I'd recommend this game even if you already have Puerto Rico.

I've played a few brief FTF games and several games in a Java based version and I like it. In fact, I'd go as far as saying that I like it far more than Puerto Rico (it plays faster with a more streamlined sequence of play). Some tough choices have to be made (fewer than in PR) and the timing of role choices is crucial. Bravo!

I really like San Juan. It's a short, fun, strategic card game that is easy to play and teach. The ease of play and focus on the roles are two things the game really has going for it. And I hate Puerto Rico and don't care for Race for the Galaxy.

I'm thinking about re-theming this game to be "Twilight Imperium: the card game", because the theme is pretty much the only thing I would change about this game, if I could. :p

RATING: 7.5
San Jan is a really fun game to play if you've only got 45 minutes or so. My one gripe is that sometimes I feel like I can't get going because I don't draw the cards I need. I mean that there is a pretty large luck component in the cards you are able to draw and build. But there's probably strategies to overcome this that I just haven't figured out yet, like using the councilor effectively.

HARRY Always have time for this game - one of the first games that we bought and heavily played - more than a gateway game IMO though still quite good for introducing to the non-gamer and as a Race for the Galaxy 101. Best memory was an epic game on the beach with my GF where I won 53-52 as she mistakenly told me that she had the palace card so I ended the game quickly otherwise she would have broken the 60 point barrier (she is clearly better at this and RFtG than me so it was all the sweeter!).

A very polished game that plays well.  It works very well in many aspects, it takes a bit to come to a full understanding of the potential impact of certain cards.  Guild Hall seems slightly unbalanced at times, unless you have other smart players gunning to do the same strategy.  Drops my overall rating.  Slightly overrated as is.

I can see why people like this game, but it just bores me. I find none of the tension present in Puerto Rico here in San Juan. I just didn't care about the outcome of the game, although I was trying. I'd rather play St. Petersburg over this. And I don't like that game much either. I guess I'd just rather play PR or nothing.

I've played Puerto Rico for years and rate it highly. I've played Race for the Galaxy and didn't enjoy it - and still don't after many (apparently required to grok it) plays. So what could fit in the middle? San Juan! Bought it at my FLGS and got in a play with my wife - my favorite 2-player gamer! We had a good time with it, but like Trajan, I wasn't blown away. It feels a bit ho-hum somehow. I think it is better for me and mine than Race without doubt because it runs smoother and faster and (yes) easier. So I give it decent marks and will very likely get it to the table many times in the future.

EDIT: More plays (just 2-player) means I like it more. There is a bit of luck with it, but I *think* skill still wins the day. There are some pretty interesting cards to play and I'd like to try it more just to see this aspect.

EDIT: More plays and I am very much in love with it as a nice weight, 2, 3 or 4 player game. I think of it as a slightly heavier filler game. So good in that space - and really unique in my collection.

Juego de cartas mucho mas sencillo que el puerto rico, y más corto, con lejanas sensaciones a este. Recuerda a un gloria a roma pero más sencillo, y mucho más redondo al no poder hacer mega combos, y estar más controlada e igualada la partida. Sin duda un grandísimo juego de cartas recomendable para muchos, tiene más gracia con 3-4 jugadores.

San Juan has truly matured in a good way. At first I found it slightly obsolete with Race for the Galaxy in the market but now I've started to appreciate its elegance. Everything works perfectly and the game can be taught in 5 minutes while it offers great moments for years. Plays great as a 2-player game, too.

An enjoyable card game that captures the feeling of Puerto Rico in a shorter play time.  It also feels quite similar to Race for the Galaxy, with less of a learning curve.

Very clever card version of Puerto Rico. I love that it's simpler to setup and play, and admire how much of the lavour of the original they managed to keep. However, I miss the passive aggressive player interaction of the original (San Juan has very little interaction) and the loss of shipping limits the paths to victory somewhat.

A good game in it's own right. 

Update 2008 06 23:

This game is superseded by the similar, but in my opinion superior, Race for the galaxy and Glory to Rome. The only advantage of San Juan is simplicity... unfortunately it's not what I'm after.

I tried to like this game, but to no avail.  I love Puerto Rico, but this seemed seemed dull and confusing in comparison.  It actually seems harder to learn than Puerto Rico, because there is no real theme that ties it together.  The only advantage over Puerto Rico is playing time and setup time.  I'd play again, but only to see if it's as bad as I think it is after 2 playings.  Maybe somewhere in there I am missing something.

Puerto Rico's baby brother comes good. The cards dictate your options, but within these there are many choices to make. The roles remain at the heart of the game and the new role is enjoyable and appropriate for the new game. The cards have multiple uses, and this adds to the confusion and difficulty but after a few games they quickly become clear. The speed of the game is really good - hardly any downtime as the multiple options are considered and the use of cards means that the atmosphere is much more relaxed than PR. This will attract more people to play San Juan, while a few who relish the control within PR may be put off. 
Overall rating after 5 games is excellent.

RATING: 7
An excellent game.  Role selection, hand management, variable trade values.

The Race for the Galaxy precursor.  I came at this one backwards, having played many games of Race before I reached San Juan.  The commonalities are numerous and obvious.  I've been told before that once you've played Race there really isn't a reason to go (back) to San Juan.  That's spot on.  It's unfortunate because this really is a good game, it's just obsolete.  If you like Race, you should play San Juan once (but no more, really) just to see what a pre-Race world was like.

My rating reflects my willingness to play it more than the game itself.  Had I played San Juan pre-Race, I probably would have rated it an 8 or 9.  Now, however, I have it at a 7 due to it being outmoded.

I can't believe people prefer this to Race, or anything really. 

The cards are all so linear, yet even then there is a clear hierarchy.

STRATEGY 

This is a card game in which you construct buildings and produce goods, such as coffee and sugar, in the city of San Juan, Puerto Rico. Player with the most victory points wins! Maggie and I really like this one. A good lunch time selection.

We own the expansions for the game that are included in the Treasure Chest. They are in the box.

Recommended with 2-4 players (best 3). 45-60 mins.

This small game has some good concepts integrated. There's a constant inner conflict what to do with which cards (since they can be used in various ways). The game suffers from some balance issues though, producing and selling goods is rarely the best option.

A poor game based purely on luck!!! I you just build violett building, you will win the game. I needs two rounds of play just to "make cards" if you invest in production. 
This game is a complete failure and has nothing to do with Puerto Rico at all.

I like SJ because the mechanics are fairly simple and the game plays quickly, yet it's still an involved game. 

My only issue with SJ is that some games can get repetitive with 2 players. If you get the right cards, you can overwhelm your opponent quite easily. I've had several games with my bf where one of us gets all the cards that let you produce an extra good and sell an extra good, and that player simple churns out buildings and collects off the "6" buildings at the end of the game. In one game, I didn't get any of those producer/trader bonus cards and had to frantically (yet slowly due to a smaller production capacity) build monuments, other high point cards (I ended up with 2 silver smelters), and store chapel cards just to be somewhat competitive. 

Ah yeah, I also love the score sheets. In fact, every game should come with one - recording dates, players, and game wins is easier than ever!

Tracked on family game list (grooven).

Plays well and it captures the flavor of Puerto Rico very well.  PR light? Yes. Since it is a card game the luck of the draw plays a part. If you cannot play any production buildings early on then catching the leader is impossible.  But this does not happen too often and if it does I would recommend starting over.

A tight and accessible implementation of the Puerto Rico theme in a card game. The role selection works well, though it's not incredibly deep. The aim of the game is to build up a card drawing engine and aim at a prestige building or two. It's fun (in limited doses) and well put together, but not altogether deep enough to be anything very special.

Haven't played this with more than two, so I'd be interested to see how the dynamic changes. Still, it's a quick game that has a different mechanism (Puerto Rico role selection). I'll say that this has been coming out more than Race for the Galaxy, simply because it's lighter and easier to get into. Still, for a quick game, Innovation, Battle Line, and Ra come out much more often, so I don't know how much staying power this one's got. I suppose it's still got a place, though.

These days Race for the Galaxy casts a long shadow over San Juan.  Race has more cards (buy all the expansions and have many more), more viable strategies and, to me, a more appealing theme.

San Juan's advantages are all in terms of simplicity.  There are fewer rules to digest and there is card text instead of icons. New players have no need of a reference card.  Simpler doesn't mean that San Juan is stripped of interesting decisions either; building an efficient combination to produce both income and v.p.s is quite challenging.

Production quality is good, artwork is quite pleasing and the rules are clear.

Loved this game, played it a lot in summer 2007. Now, I only get it out when someone else asks for it. Much prefer Race for the Galaxy in every way. Basically, seems to me that San Juan (at least with the strategies we play) relies to much on drawing the relatively small number of 6ers. In comparison Race has more 6ers, more chances to draw them, and more variety with more different strategies. 

Expansion adds a lot of new strategies, works very well.

Works well right across 2-4 players.

Unfortunately several essential 6-er cards have gone missing from my copy, hence currently listing it as Previously Owned. Also the cathedral and some events. :(

I've been using this as an intoduction to select non-gamers.  It has strategy, a mechanic to offer players unique advantages each round and gameplay that is inclusive through to the end.

Yes, it's nowhere near the depth of Puerto Rico, but it's superquick to explain (regardless of whether you've played PR or not), and plays, honestly, in 20-30 minutes. In those 20-30 minutes, you pack in a good amount of tactics, strategy, and subtlety, with a small dash of luck. A top-notch middleweight game that plays in the time of a filler, which makes it a keeper.

Drug this out recently for some pub play.  It's been on the shelf for almost 2 years.  What a great game in a smaller box.  We played 2 players as well as 3 players and it all ended with the "let's try that again" mentality with each one of us looking to take what we learned in that game and apply it in the next.  Multiple paths to victory, too, which is nice.  In one game, the Chapel was the path to the win.  In another game, dual City Halls was too much to overcome.  Of all the more cult of the new games that I've been playing, it's refreshing to remind myself that some of the titles in my collection for years are still solid plays.

Different enough from Puerto Rico to warrant owning both. Requires knowledge of all the cards and how they interact to play well. Good with two players.

I actually like this more than Puerto Rico as the buildings complement each better and it feels even more streamlined.

I disliked this game a long, long time ago - something about feeling like one had too many resources.  Recently revisited it with a new pair of eyes, having played Race for the Galaxy for example.  Found it remarkably simple to pick back up with only a casual scan of the rules, years after the last play.  Compared to RFTG I was relieved to know at a visual glance what my opponents actually held.  I know that some people have played this one thoroughly into the ground, and I can see how it might be deserving of such replay.  Will give it more of a shot with two.

Definitely the bridge between Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy.  It is a lot easier to understand than RFTG because the text is right there on the card.  However, it doesn't feel like it works as well, primarily because all of your points come from buildings.  This makes the build action the most important in the game.  The combos seem limited here, and I think I would much rather play PR or RFTG.  It's still a fine game.

San Juan is the faster, simpler version of Puerto Rico. The game is quite fun, essentially a city building card game. Yet, there is a lot of cost-benefit decision making. Do you build up buildings or do build up your farms to get more resources? Do you build up now and end the game, or wait till the time is right? I highly recommend this game, especially for fans of Puerto Rico who would like to play something faster.

RATING: 7.5
Having gone back and played a reasonable amount of San Juan, I have to say, it plays differently than Race for the Galaxy in some subtle ways. For one, it's an awful lot simpler in that there are many fewer unique cards, meaning there are also fewer mechanics. It's not only easier to teach than RftG, but it also allows for somewhat more reliable strategies. Good combinations are more important to remember because they're more likely to happen. There's still the issue of 6-cost buildings, but it's somewhat mitigated by the fact that, as with most (if not all) other buildings, there's more than one copy of each available.

RATING: 5
"Puerto Rico Light".  As a teaching game for Puerto Rico, the game works well.  As a light fast version of Puerto Rico, the game works well.  As a game, it suffers the same problems as its big brother.  Play can feel like it is not in the player's control and thus leaves players feeling played by the game.  Because of the card draw aspect, the game feels more random and less strategic than Puerto Rico.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

I actually have a half dozen more plays of this game that I have played with my kids at work. They like it a lot and, after two or three plays, they were able to really pick up on the card combinations.  I do not prefer this to Race for the Galaxy, though it is easier to pick up and play a quick game of this than with Race, which seems heavier.

RATING: 8
Plays well with 2 and I enjoy playing solitaire also.  The learning curve on this is not nearly as steep as Puerto Rico, and plays more quickly.  Experienced Puerto Rico players may complain that it's too luck driven.  This is a friendlier game for non-gamers than Puerto Rico and isn't nearly so brutal on beginners.  The mistake that I see most often with people learning to play is that the victory points are at the bottom of the card, not the number at the top.  I often put too much emphasis on production and trading when I could be more effective.

RATING: 6
See Puerto Rico.  Simpler and all card based.  Less turn order dependent, but more late game random.  But that I mean that the last turn or two can easily dictate a third or more of your victory points. So in that short window the luck-of-the-draw element is pretty strong.  Not really a problem though, because as a card game you pretty much accept luck-of-the-draw as part of the landscape.

Still, versus something like Hearts this game pales.

update:  low interaction really starts to undermine this.  Race for the Galaxy opened my eyes to this (by having the same problem).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Unlike Puerto Rico, San Juan takes little time to play and it relies on a lot of luck. As others have noted, I look at it as a light version of Race for the Galaxy. It's easy to learn and fun to play, but it doesn't have enough depth to earn a higher ranking.

Puerto Rico in card-game form, stripped down to just the role selections and buildings.  Meaty for a card game. 

Update: Subtracted two points from initial rating.  Not nearly as social as Puerto Rico, which isn't that social to begin with.  I also don't think there are enough roles to choose from, and that some of the cards are game-breaking if played at the right time.

RATING: 5
This is the card game version of Puerto Rico. Overall, it is a fairly good adaptation as it maintains the interesting role-selection mechanic in Puerto Rico. In this mechanic, a player selects an action, which all other players take. The key is to select actions that will benefit yourself more than other players. For instance, producing goods when no other player has the ability/space to produce good. 

That being said, the card game is considerably lighter than Puerto Rico. And drawing specific cards, at certain points of the game, can effect the outcome. I don't want to suggest that this is some luck-fest (it is not)... it's just that the decisions are much more superficial than Puerto Rico. And considering the time it takes to play this game (45+ mins), I find myself wanting to play Puerto Rico instead.

RATING: 6
I've play San Juan on my phone around 80 times before playing in person, but it still manged to surprise and delight me. First, I really like the components, the cards are nice, the role and shipping placards are thick and sturdy and the included pencil and scorepad are a nice touch. It has a nice balance between easy of place and strategy compared to Race for the Galaxy, even if Race is the better game IMHO. San Juan is a nice appetizer/desert, while a game or two of Race is a full meal in my opinion.

It's not PR, but it's a good, light game that feels somehow alike (maximizing "gold" a.k.a. cards income while retaining precious VPs, just like in PR). The greatest complain I have about it is it's seemingly high luck factor.

UPDATE: Definitely not PR whatsoever. The game is rather chaotic, and has not a small fraction of PR's tension. Rating dropped to a 6.

UPDATE: With Race for the Galaxy out there, there is no need whatsoever to play this broken game.

Don't let early calls of "this seems too complicated" discourage you.  After a few rounds you'll have everyone asking for one more game.  I've even encountered people in my travels who demand I leave my copy with them before I left.

This is a pretty simple game.  I see this game to be a very good gateway game.  It is also a card game, which intrigues me because we do quite a lot of traveling/hicking/camping.  The compactibility is a definite plus.  I am interested in exploring this further.

Now that I own and enjoy Race for the Galaxy.  San Juan and I will never be seen together.  Even though this game is not really broken, I am going to have to rate it as if it is broken.  I never want to play the game again so as far as I am concerned, it is "broken."

Many more plays on ios. A game I like a lot, though with 2 and 3 player the selection of roles can become a bit repetetive, with some roles just not selected. Better with four for this reason perhaps? 
Also the Library seems a little overpowered perhaps? At least when I played it early the last time and then motored through Prospector/Builder with a Quarry and a judicious use of Councillor (with Prefecture) to successfully pick up a City Hall and won with a score of 34 to the next best 19, it seemed as if the Library had won me the game too easily!

San Juan may not be as complex as Puerto Rico, but to my mind, it's a lot more fun. I've only had the game for 4 days and I've already spotted 5 or 6 different strategies, so there is certainly a lot of depth there. I love the Crane!!!

An excellent game that forces you to play the cards you are dealt as well as possible. There are several ways to win, but if you can get Quarry, Prefecture and Carpenter early, you will have a very good chance of winning. Focus on building purple cards and hope to hit a 6 value or two as the game winds down. If you can also get the Library it will help, but it's not critical.

A good game but does not have the depth of strategy of Race for the Galaxy, decision making just feels easier. Also there is more luck than in RftG because of the need to draw 6 cost buildings, while in RftG one can more easily win without 6 cost developments. A plus for SJ is that it is easier to teach and thus appears to be a lighter game.

Comment: Kan ook met 2 gespeeld worden, maar dan is het spel toch niet zo interactief en niet voldoende gebalanceerd.

Ann had dan wel een zeer goede tactiek om veel geld te vergaren, maar heeft deze uiteindelijk niet kunnen omzetten in de juiste grote gebouwen.  Tja, je moet ze ook in handen krijgen natuurlijk.

RATING: 8
Very good card game based on Puerto Rico.  Pros are that it plays faster than Puerto Rico and does not require as much management of pieces.  Cons are that it is simpler and relies a little more on luck rather than strategy.  Still a very good game, although I wish they would have made it 5 players like Puerto Rico.  Four is too few in my opinion.

Purchased to increase an order so I could get free shipping and handling. Also I like Puerto Rico, but sometimes set up is time prohibitive.  Took it to the coast during a getaway with my wife.  We enjoyed a number of games together, as well as the variety of uses for the cards.  Very well thought out and strategic game.  Look forward to sharing it with others.  [Market price]

Box has a small dent on the top edge, almost like it had been pushed up against something round (golfball?) and slight shelf wear on the corners. Otherwise, box is solid with no split corners. Contents are complete. All cards and role placards are in super shape, and score pad still has 46 sheets on it, with scoring for four games on each one. (That's over 180 games to play!) One trading house tile has a crease and the rule set is wrinkled, but it's a great copy for those that want this presently hard to acquire game in their collection.

I prefer this to PR. Quick yet deep, reasonable luck factor yet still strongly strategic. Still gets plenty of plays after 2 years of owning.

Update: feels supreceded by Race For The Galaxy currently so rating reduced accordingly - so many less routes to victory here. Still enjoy this on occasions though.

I've only played a few games of this so far, but so far I've had a blast with it.  I always seem to lose in our two-player games, though.

Two sessions this has been played with four people.  Both times, we played two games back to back.  That's a good sign for what seems to be a great game.

UPDATE: This has turned into one of my favorite card games.  We're not too excited by the two player version anymore, and we generally only play it with 4 these days.

A streamlined, simplified version of [i][GAMEID=3076],[/i] played only with cards and a few tiles.  Fast, addictive play good for two or three players (I haven't tried four yet). Lack of complexity relative to bookcase games like its larger sibling should make [i]San Juan[/i] a good introduction game for new players.

After several playings, from two players to four, I absolutely love this game.  It is light enough to teach to new players, yet deep enough to have effective variations on strategy.  True, the cards do add quite a bit of luck to the game, but that can be mitigated somewhat with the right buildings and proper role selection.  The four player game doesn't have as much anxiety over role selection each round, since only one role will not be picked.

Interesting concept and easy fun. It is not very time consuming and very easy to learn. Best played with some time between games to make it stay fun. Last played with 3 of my friends and with a secret expansion.

The goal is to build up the city of San Juan and become the permanent govenor. When the first player reaches 12 properties the game is over but it is not necessarily he/she who wins. Properties are worth different points and when counted together the winner is determined.

Expansion tries to add even more depth and choises to the game

I think San Juan is a fabulous game but two things resulted in the game making its way to the sell/trade pile:

1) Race for the Galaxy

In regards to #2: the ability to play a game with as much depth as San Juan in < 10 minutes (my record is 5.5 minutes) pretty much kills my desire to play it face to face.

San Juan is a nice, fast game which still has a significant amount of strategy to it.

Overall I'd say it's a bit unbalanced.  A high-production strategy is usually the best and whoever can execute on it first is tough to beat.  The other roles are have their own strategies, but none of them are as effective as straight up production because production gives you both the options of what to play as well as the means to play it.  There is very little player interaction, so it's mostly a matter of making the most of the cards you receive.

Still, San Juan is great fun and withstands hundreds of plays.  Great for two or three or even four.  One suggestion I make is to replace using cards as production barrels by using tokens instead, which cuts down greatly on reshuffling without changing the character nor tactics of the game.

RATING: 7
Great 2-player alternative for Puerto Rico. Plays quick and it's pretty easy to teach. Ultimately, I'm hoping this will act as a first-step in convincing my wife to play Race for the Galaxy. They seem pretty similar and she doesn't seem to mind just about any theme she's presented with so I think we'll be able to make the switch pretty soon.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2011/12/san-juan.html]San Juan[/url] tiene dificultad media, no es complicado, pero no trivial.  De reglas fáciles pero no simples, las estrategias son claras pero no evidentes. El análisis-parálisis no es desesperante al no tener muchas decisiones complejas que tomar. No apto para todos los público, para jugones es ligero. Juego perfecto para dar el salto cualitativo y pasar de un nivel de complejidad familiar a jugón de más injundia y mantenerlos dentro. Como juego para matar el rato o por su magnifica potabilidad, tiene su nicho. 

La selección de roles y la variedad de edificios, y un mecanismo que funciona muy bien, crean un dinamismo que hace que funcione sin problemas y presenta un constante desafío. 

Me gusta, es un juego sólido, aunque no es un gran juego. Sólo un buen juego de cartas, que no es poco.

Good game, with a similar feel to Puerto Rico.  The production/trading mechanic felt a little hollow at first but then grew on me as the game went on.  Have a feeling I may have underestimated it, so would like to play again.

When I want to describe this game, there's one key word that comes to mind...elegant.  This game just seems to flow so nicely.  I love the interaction of the different buildings, and the various ways you can score points.  Perhaps the coolest thing is the way that you find yourself desperate to take all the different roles on your turn but you can only take one.  So what do you do?  It also works great as a 2-player game, which is a nice added feature.

I think this game is light years ahead of Race for the Galaxy.  The fact that the mechanisms are more straightforward and the actions are spelled out with words instead of silly symbols on the cards make this game a winner for my family and other new players.  I'm also amazed how much interaction is added to the proceedings by only allowing one player to use each role.  It completely takes away the multi-player solitaire issue that many complain about in RftG, because you always have to watch what your opponents are doing.  This game is definitely one I want to add to my collection.

Excellent "Race for the Galaxy Light"; not as good as that game in theory, but easier to teach to newcomers, less fiddly with no victory point tokens or need to sort through the deck so much to start the game (pulling out homeworlds or action cards), and therefore sees more table time in my groups.

Excellent game and works quite well with 2, 3 and 4 players. Played it quite a lot, when San Juan was released, but not so often any more.
Game will work fine with your girlfriend/wife because there is not much possibility to do nasty moves.
Unfortunately, the game comes down to luck, when playing with someone else, who has played San Juan often and knows well, what works and what doesn't. Also, when playing the game with people, who never played before, its almost impossible not to win.

Decent tableau-building game that really does play like Puerto Rico-lite.

Not as much variation in strategies as I would like, and there are too many buildings that are too expensive for their effect (e.g. the production-related violet buildings) compared to the other buildings available.  But it's fast to play and easier to explain than Race for the Galaxy.

I'm looking forward to seeing how the expansion changes things.

Not a bad game, very much PR lite with all of PRs good and bad points.

Between the two I think I would rather play PR as the substitution of cards for cash, goods and (to some extent) VP simplifies the game rather too much for me, but enjoyable non-the-less.

Although thematically boring and colourless, San Juan turned out to be a decent card game: the way it plays reminds of other similar card games, mainly Race for the Galaxy, which came out some years later though. [i](April 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - To be honest, it’s way more fun to conquer planets than to sell coffee beans: thus, as one of the goals I set for my Fall 2015 rating revise was to limit half-point ratings to a handful of games, I rounded down my rating from 6,5 to 6.

A good way to work someone up to Puerto Rico. Gives them the concepts of role-driven turns and of constructing buildings that give you privileges. I do worse and worse every time I play this game. I do well at Puerto Rico, but I can't figure this one out, and I'm liking it less and less.

Dont play this much anymore, as Race has taken over, but the new expansion should breathe some life into this one.

Has grown on me the more I play.  I would like to play this with 3-4.  I feel it would be more exiting with more.

An excellent card game. Similar to Puerto Rico but very enjoyable on it's own.  Plays quickly with plenty of "perk" cards.  
My biggest complaint is the Guild Hall card is much too powerful.  It dominates the game.

RATING: 9
Initial impressions after about 20 games were unfavorable.  I think it was because I played on BSW and got stomped without any real reason as to why.  FtF play unveiled the game to me, but I was spoiled by the quick plays of BSW.  

A great card game that has surpassed Puerto Rico in my view.  The delicious hand management restricts choices and provides a variability sorely lacking in its older sibling—all while adding another layer of strategic depth.  By distilling the best of Puerto Rico and attaching some luck, Seyfarth crafted his masterpiece.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
UPDATE: I've knocked this down a couple of pegs, mostly due to having now played Race for the Galaxy.  RftG takes the mechanics of San Juan and improves them in so many ways that I can no longer look at San Juan the same way.  Basically, it comes down to the question of why play San Juan when I could play RftG.
------------
My new favorite card game -- right up there with Bohnanza.  This is always fun and quick enough that you can get in several games in a night.  I've only played with 4, which seems to be the right amount.So far, there doesn't seem to be a problem of any specific cards dominating over others, which I kind of expected going in.This could go up to a 10 in the future -- we'll see.

I had hoped that my rating for this would go up with more plays. It hasn't. My problem is that I still feel like I'd rather play Puerto Rico, or four or five other games in our collection, than this. It feels, for lack of a better word, limited. If we were to buy it, it would be used as a primarily 2-player game. It's not that there's anything I specifically dislike about this game, I just have other 2-player card games of the exact same length and weight of play that I find to be far more satisfying. Actually, I have other 3 and 4-player games that I enjoy better, too, which is an indication that we probably shouldn't buy this. We've borrowed it twice now, and I still feel the same.

More approachable than Race for the Galaxy, but I don't like it as much.  It seems that luck of the draw is a BIGGER factor in San Juan than RftG.  The expansion card Harbor seems to be a really powerful luck of the draw card too.  The biggest allure of San Juan for me is being able to squeeze a very lightweight version of Puerto Rico into a lunch hour!  Any chance to get the production / trading machine going is a good experience! :-)  (My new favorite low cost card is Poor House!  That was a income machine for me!)

RATING: 3
Initally thought this was great, but I'm liking it less and less now - seems you are led by the cards you draw early on, and luck of pulling the 'end' cards is a big factor, if you never get one you're going to struggle. More I get forced to play this one, less I like it, certainly many other games I'd rather play, now I'm at the stage where I generally play on auto-pilot, which isn't good :( Oh and the endless reshuffling is a pain, especially if there are gold mines out or libraries - so the deck gets burned through quickly.

*** Update, tried Race for the Galaxy - can't see me ever playing this again now, Race is so much better.

**** Update, played with the kids - my son prefers Race, this is on the trade pile

Cute, fun, great premise and better execution.  Hard to win with anything but two locked-in strategies, though, and there are too many cards I'd just never play.

Good cardgame with just enough of that Puerto Rico feeling but having its own gameplay.
However, they could replace the governor, the rolecards and the market markers by regular cards while removing pad and pencil (who needs them?), so the game would fit in a small package and be cheaper. Anyway, the game is also worth the price for the big box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Cheap to purchase.  Worth every penny.  Easy to learn and let a person build tactics/strategies for other harder games.
  This game follows the pattern of selecting a role or worker and with that selection you gain an advantage allong the same lines but everyone playing also gets the primary action you choose, less the advantage.  It all is based on cards that are traded as currency and also come up as various buildings to build and what not, found also in Peurto Rico.  I would consider this game to be RFtG light or Peurto Rico light.

This game is a great way to pass an hour or two.

These days, most gamers seem to prefer the "meatier" Race for the Galaxy, but I prefer San Juan's faster and more streamlined play. Many interesting decisions despite a limited amount of cards. Luck can certainly be a factor, but it's a fast game, so it's not such a big deal.

This was my gateway Euro and still one of my favorites.

Adaptación estupenda del juego Puerto Rico para disfrutar igual con sólo 110 cartas. Las cartas lo son todo: edificios para construir, mercancías para vender y dinero para pagar. El espíritu del juego ha quedado intacto, pero el sistema (y el tiempo de juego) ha disminuido notablemente. Es una gran adquisición.

(original assessment / '5')
At one time a decent card game which simulated a quick play of Puerto Rico.

Now it plays second fiddle to 'Race for the Galaxy' in my gaming circles.

(Jan 2012 update / upgrade to '7')
With the discovery of Condado, an android clone of this game, I find myself playing it much more on my tablet in order to quickly pass the time.  Condado has all the expansions, which in turn made me seek them out for my physical copy, and this will be entering the rotation again.

Where RftG got more and more complex with the various expansions, San Juan still feels fairly crisp and clean.  Getting to play it rapid fire against AI opponents on the android tablet has let me explore (without much time investment) various strategies and capabilities.

Basic strategy remains to build a card generation engine and then build, build, build, though there are other paths to victory if you can get out of the mindset that there is only one way to win.

The role choosing mechanism provides the similar flavor to the great Puerto Rico, making it a favorite, though the roles are slightly different. Nice scale of the game to get the twelve buildings, so the game is not too long, yet presents enough time to make a plan. The game really plays well with 3 players, also works with 2 or 4 players. UPDATE: It can occasionally happen that a player does not draw the big (6 cost) bonus cards for end-game scoring. However, playing the card earlier, instead of discarding, may need to be contemplated to avoid this end game issue. UPDATE: The expansion seems to address this with the new Cathedral building, after sevveral plays. Overall, the new cards are a positive addition with extra choices and variety. The new event cards add just enough to the game, and I would not want anything more added as it has reached the limit of decisions that should be available.

As the precursor of Race for the Galaxy, this game has considerably less depth. However, it delivers a good dose of fun in a relatively short time. Good game.

RATING: 6.5
As a big fan of RFTG and 51st state, I assumed I would like this game. Admittedly, I was sure it would be light in comparison to those other games. After my first play (a close 32 to 31 point loss), I was not all that enamoured. There just aren't that many different routes to victory and the choices don't seem so interesting. For folks that are intimidated by the iconography of RFTG or 51st state, I can understand preferring this game. For me, I would much rather play the heftier card games. I think San Juan will go to the summer home.

San Juan is fast and mindboggling. There is a luck element in the game but skilled player can play against her bad luck. One of the best card games so far for me.

I love SJ with 2 and 3 players. With four game tends to be too much luck based but is nevertheless easily playable.

I also enjoy SJ a lot in bsw.

RATING: 9.5
It may be "Puerto Rico light" to some but it's a great game on its own and a great introduction to the PR mechanic.  The multiple uses of cards is very clever.  Especially good choice if you only have 2 players or only an hour to play.

After about 50 ftf plays and probably 200 on iOS, I feel like I've played San Juan out. Most decisions are made on auto-pilot now and I don't feel like I'm learning anything more about the game. It was really fun getting to this point, but I've sold it on and will concentrate on RftG for my tableau-building card gaming pleasure :)

After the first play with the expansion buildings (haven't used the events yet), they're neat but seem somewhat overpowered - specifically the Bank and the Gold Office or whatever it's called - one player got 8 or 10 cards out of it throughout the game, which seems like a LOT.

Many, many plays later (at least 40 not recorded here on BGG) and I still really like SJ.  I like its streamlined game play and the ability to set up neat combos.  I really wish I could play this more.

I do think it's best with 4, so the production strategy has a chance. With only 2 or 3 players, it's too hard to produce by yourself, leading to one-dimensional play.

I keep upping the ranking on this game despite my ability to lose almost every time. What a great game - It's not Puerto Rico, it is its own game and almost better in some ways (shocking but true!)

RATING: 9
An under-appreciated gem especially with the expansion.  I originally thought there wasn't much to it and got Race for the Galaxy expecting a meatier game.  However after some time I traded RFTG away and now appreciate the beauty of San Juan.  It does all that RFTG does with a such a small footprint.

The variety of buildings in this game can be confusing at first, but unlike Puerto Rico, this game is all about building buildings so the strategy is more straight forward. One of those games that is good with two players, although luck plays a part in whether you get a good hand.

Wonderful game, faster and lighter than Puerto Rico, with all the fun left in. The packaging is a bit ponderous, though. I mean, why is a score pad needed when the score is only added up at the end?

Tried this with my fiancee after playing Citadels. The similarity between the games made this easier to teach. Quite fun! But it seemed easy for one player to churn ahead with a few lucky production draws, and the overpowered Library or City Hall cards.

UPDATE: My fiancee loves, loves, loves this game. We'll be playing this a lot.

UPDATE (12/27/12): I love this game so much. So, so much. But it is definitely true that with the base cards it gets a little old after about a dozen plays. There are a lot of cards that are just objectively better than others. And there are only a few defined pathways to success.

Seems to boil a lot of the good stuff from Puerto Rico down to a nice, simple, quick-playing, modest-sized package. You've got the tough choices, the nice flavor, but without the intensity of its big brother, an intensity that is good sometimes but not always. While San Juan doesn't have quite the visceral draw of Puerto Rico, its a very nice game which I like a lot and has had excellent replay value.

Almost all of the gameplay of Puerto Rico without the too-long set up and take down times. The game works beautifully as a two player game.

For some reason, I have more "fun" playing this then I do Puerto Rico. I don't know why since the theme is exactly the same. Perhaps it is because the game moves so much quicker and doesn't suffer quite as much from Analysis Paralysis as Puerto Rico does.

Fast little filler.  Not as much meat as I would like.  May change over multiple plays.  My wife prefers Puerto Rico, and would rather we play the computer version if it is the 2 of us.  Would get more plays otherwise.  (12/18/08)

Heather still does not enjoy it (she feels the cards you could possibly get are way too random, compared to everyone getting the same chance for buildings in Puerto Rico).  It is getting better for me, I'd rather play this 2 player than 2 player PR.  (1/18/09)

This has become our game of choice while at work.  It handles 2-4 people really easily without dragging the game out any.  Tommy and Wendell enjoy it (although Wendell doesn't seem to score too highly).  Upgraded to 8 based on outstanding chances to play.  (1/8/10)

RATING: 6
Sure it's a little lighter than Puerto Rico but it takes 10 seconds to setup and plays in less time.  That makes it better in my book.  I will start to think it's scripted or broken and then I'll pull of a win with a different strategy.  Some of those seemingly sucky building are actually pretty cool.  Excellent 2 player.

UPDATE: After playing it again circa 2014 I really don't find much to recommend in San Juan, especially after playing Race for the Galaxy. There are really only a couple of viable strategies at most. Grabbing the expansion might help. Still, it is an excellent intro game for folks who haven't played Euros or role selection games.

One of the most elegant card games ever made. The cards-as-currency system is pure genius. Has a lot of the fun of Puerto Rico but in a simpler, quicker form. That said, even with the added inherent luck of the draw it does start to feel scripted after a lot of play. However, that doesn't really stop the game from being great and it truly is impressive that they managed to balance it so that there are multiple equally valid paths to victory. So even though I do tire of it from time to time, San Juan remains a fantastic game.

It's a good game, but I always feel that I would rather be playing Puerto Rico. 5 or 6 buildings seem overpowered, and that isn't fully reflected in the prices. If you don't get them, you can't win. Also, the timing of when the end-game scoring buildings come out can really screw you. And good luck if you don't get Silver or Coffee in the early game. The 2-player game is broken because of the library.

[u]May 2010:[/u] Just bought. I LOVE Race For The Galaxy so always was afraid that this would feel both similar and less rewarding. I've finally bought it so we'll see about that. Right now, I'm expecting a card game that is similar to RFTG, but a lot lighter and casual, hoping it will be just different enough so that it keeps a spot in my collection.

[u]Novmber 2010:[/u] Yeah... After having played RFTG this really comes accross as a dumbed down version. I don't really see myself playing this over Race, maybe to introduce young cousins or something... Maybe I would have rated it higher if I hadn't played RFTG before. Now, I guess I would even rate it lower on account that I was just bored during my two plays, not feelin challenged at all but I do recognize it is kind of a good game... Do yourself a favour, go straight for the good stuff... if you have the stomach for it.

San Juan is okay, but I would always prefer to play Puerto Rico (and PR doesn't even take THAT much longer; I usually finish a game of PR in 60-75 minutes). My girlfriend doesn't find it very interesting as it ends in such a short amount of time, so she doesn't get that feeling of actually building something. I guess I can see what she means.

I do like the role selection, and I think the buildings are very varied and balanced. Ultimately it's an okay card game but it's not something I'm deeply in awe of.

I'd always rather have a full-on game of Puerto Rico, but this works as a filler. Keeping in mind people's suggestion to treat them as seperate games. I like that this is more portable and more 2-player friendly. I was going to trade this when my wife dubbed it, "Puerto Rico, the Travel Edition." I also like that the cards are used in several different ways (as money, buildings and commodities.) If there is one thing I would take from this and put into Puerto Rico, it's the slightly randomized commodities prices.

[i]Update January 2007[/i] - This is often requested by my wife as a heavier card game or when she wants Puerto Rico but we don't have any other players. Having played this a bunch of times now, I'm liking it less and less. Yes, I agree with others that half the game is strategy.. but the other half is still total luck. What cards I draw towards the beginning make or break the entire game. 7->6

As a card version of Puerto Rico, San Juan is pretty good. My favorite card game type of the shared role selection is still Glory to Rome. But, San Juan is the better choice if you want to play with folks or family that are not up for the rigors of a more difficult game.

San Juan is pretty simple, with two things that elevates the difficulty for non-gamers: cards act as buildings, money, and goods... and a new player has to struggle through all the different types of purple buildings. But once they learn those concepts, they can actually start playing the game for fun.

RATING: 8
Fun, and it can move more quickly than its partner game PR.  It's a great shorter length game to break out between games, especially when there's not much table space.  One problem I've heard people complain about with this game is that some of the 6-point buildings are overpowered; whether those really act as "trump" cards depends on the rest of one's buildings though, in my opinion.  There is some luck involved with pulling the right cards to go with one's strategy though--especially if other players are burying those same cards in their chapel graveyards.  I like PR better than San Juan, but San Juan is less analysis paralysis-prone.

We generally play this 2-player, and have never played Puerto Rico.   We were worried about the length of the rulebook, but had no trouble playing.  This is a very interesting game, which we both enjoy regardless of who wins.  The basic idea is similar to that of Citadels.  Although Citadels is a little simpler, San Juan has no confrontation.  It feels like you are playing to see how well you can do with the cards you get, more than competing with others.  We have played a couple times with 3 or 4 players, and it seems to accomodate any number nicely.

Loaned to Bridget and Jeramy.(5/2011 after 58 plays) I hate to do this to a game that has served me so well and is so important to my growth in the hobby and to my family (i.e. wife) gaming. But it is just not the greatest game. I'm lowering it to a six. As far as efficiency engine games, it is the only one I need. But that isn't saying a lot. Building my engine and racing it are just not that interesting to me anymore. It is a wonderful pastime still, though.

Updated again after 35 plays. The 10 rating stays for old times sake. But San Juan is definitely not an interesting game to me anymore. It is a very enjoyable pastime.

Another update: I was just looking at my ratings and, you know, there is just no other game that I am always psyched to play. How could it not be a 10?

Update: Having played Race for the Galaxy a number of times, I just played SJ for the first time in a while. SJ just strikes me as such a much better game. The role selection mechanism and the fewer cards just make the game much more interactive for me. In RftG, I just feel like I'm trying to do my own thing and occasionally latch on to someone else's role selection like a parasite.

Originally rated an 8, but my wife and i keep coming back to it over and over. It just scratches that short-game-with-some-thinking-but-not-too-much itch.

Great game.  Cards as buildings, money, and product is brilliant and I'm surprised it works so well.  Much of the game is knowing what to build when since the role that benefits you is usually pretty apparent.  Player interaction is subtle but very present in role selection, building, trading.  
Dropped in Rating.  No reason to play this with Race for the Galaxy around.

UPDATE 11/16: After more San Juan and more Race For the Galaxy in my life, I have come around to the opinion that there is no coherent argument for San Juan in a world where Race exists, with the minute exception of the fact that San Juan has an iOS adaptation and Race, thanks in no small part to the malignant influence of the trickster god that has sullied my memory of the year the Cubs finally won the world series with things like "President-Elect Trump" and "All The Cool Musicians Are Now Dead," does not. So.

---

A quick-playing tableau-builder that builds off of the mechanics of big brother Puerto Rico. More accessible and approachable than Race For The Galaxy (the other PR card game, for all intents and purposes), and unlike RFTG, role-selection and turn order matters a great deal, so it's a little truer to the original board game in ways besides theme. SJ is a bit more self-contained than RFTG, as well, which is both good and bad -- good because it's a complete game out of the box whereas Race was designed from the ground up with expansions in mind, but bad because you will likely hit a point where you go "that's it?" (Also, gamers being gamers, there's more of an audience for aliens and pew-pew laser guns than coffee roasting, so San Juan is a tough sell to RFTG fans, grumble grumble grumble.)

San Juan is a good warmup/nightcap game, easily portable, and fun. But it's not a game that grabs you by the lapels and demands your attention.

Struggled through a learning game with a disinterested spouse.  Spoiled what could have been a really fun game for me.  Second game was with 4 players (2 newbies) and went much better.

San Juan takes my feelings about PR feeling like Magic in board game form, and adds to them by taking it into the realm of card play. More than just a blatant cash in on the PR name, but definitely lighter than its sibling, whether that is good or not is obviously subjective. It seems as though your strategy is going to be, by and large, dictated by the cards you draw in the early going though, and it's much more of a solitaire game than PR as it tends to reward specialisation in one or two phases more than PR and doesn't penalise you as much for not taking certain roles because there is no bonus associated with choosing unselected options. Much better 2 man than the PR variant rules though IMO, and the faster setup and playtime make this an ideal way to fill some time while still thinking as compared to the weight of many filler games, which are generally on the light end of the spectrum. (note: I also strongly feel that this game is quite superior to St. Pete because of the creativity inherent in finding optimum building combinations...I honestly don't understand why the two games *are* compared to begin with as aside from their release dates and claim to being board games played with cards they really have few similarities, but I guess that doesn't really matter.)

SJ is largely obsolete in the post-Race world though. I still much prefer SJ's action selection mechanism, which is a straight pull from PR, but this game feels very limited by comparison.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Must be treated as a seperate game to Peurto Rico despite the family resembalance.  It does not need to engage the brain on the same level since the cards and the situation often narrow your decisions right down.  Also the luck element is important and playing your hand to best of your ability may be your only satisfaction sometimes.

Still very enjoyable and after a bad run you can always blame the hand you were dealt even if you missed your opportunities and let the others off the hook.

OK, after 15 plays I have to rewrite my review.  This game is fantastic. It retains not only the role selection mechanic of PR but also the high-wire tension in selecting and optimizing every turn.  The cardplay system is brilliant, inspired, and sure to be cloned ad nauseum.  Cards are your buildings and your currency, so you never have a worthless card and the economic structure is solely based on getting more cards.  I'm sort of flabbergasted, really...MUCH better than I had anticipated, particularly since I don't care for card games.  2 player games can speed by in 25 minutes but with a great deal of depth.  I still would rather see Seyfarth do something totally new though, but this will do nicely for now.

Comparing this to Race for the Galaxy (as a similar game) I prefer the theme of San Juan, and I think it is also easier to learn and play (particularly if you have played puerto rico). In terms of the game mechanic I don't particularly rate the 'hand management' style of game in general. That is just personal preference as I'd much rather play a board game. In any case this one is still fun to play.

Card draws in this game can make you or kill you.  You are pretty much at the mercy of what you are drawing and trying to make the most of it.  Usually I like this in games, but where San Juan fails is that there's no hope for you if you fail to draw the big "end game" buildings that match up with what you've been doing.  And if your opponent gets the chapel and uses it effectively (to bury cards that will fit your tactics) then you are done for --and there's little you can do about it.

I love Race for the Galaxy and learned that prior to trying San Juan.  San Juan suffers by the inevitable comparison.  

Now that we've played a few times, I've discovered that the differences between San Juan and RftG are greater than I first realized.  I still think SJ is easier, but its simplicity and easier set up will sometimes make it more appealing than RftG.

Fun card game of building in San Juan.  I like how the cards are used as buildings, goods and money.  Great design!  First two plays took ~30 min.  Third play was like 20!  Each game has been 2-player so far.   Also, I made the right call in learning and teaching this card game version to my friends first.  Now we're ready for Puerto Rico.

PR wasn't any more fun and took longer.  San Juan still shines even after the foray into Race for the Galaxy, which was impressive, but slow & clunky and ultimately less fun.

Sold my copy, but only because it fetched $40 due to OOP price increase.  Love this game and will purchase when the reprint eventually comes, which will probably contain the expansion cards.  LOL

RATING: 5
I find it interesting to reflect on the relationship between San Juan and Puerto Rico; and Caylus Magna Carta and Caylus. Heck, I could even throw in the E&T duo for good measure. Learning San Juan is quite simple and straightforward, and features a nice hand management mechanic in how cards are used for buildings, points, goods and other stuff. Once you're into the game you can simply focus on getting your economic engine going, and hoping that you draw good cards at the right time. The result is quite a streamlined version of Puerto Rico which won't take as long to play. In this respect the card game once again wins from the boardgame in terms of ease of play.

What I'm not so enthusiastic about is that there doesn't seem to be an awful lot of choice nor player interaction. In the four-player game the role selection mechanic becomes rather boring after a while and not at all as agonising as it is with its bigger brother. There is hardly ever a choice you can fret over, so basically you pick what suits you best and hope that you profit more from that role than do your opponents. The fun then comes in from attempting to construct various 'good combos' which have your ecomomy running at peak efficiency, and seeing how your theories compare against those of others. This game, like so many other economy games, is therefore not fun to play if your opponents differ too much in level of skill.

It is a friendly conversion of the boardgame, but compared against its cousins, I still say CMC is better. There the luck of the draw was relegated very wisely to a personal deck, so there is no question of someone getting an inherently better card than someone else. CMC changes nature as easily as a leopard its spots because of the random starter buildings. CMC can put the squeeze on all players because of a much more lively economy—it is to some extent shared, so you 'feel' what others are doing far more directly. It would have been fairly easy to give San Juan a similar constrained feel, and I find it somewhat disappointing to discover that it didn't. It is not fair to make one game an arbitrary yard stick and expect another game to hold up: San Juan is of course its own game. But I cannot help but thinking that a bit more bite wouldn't have hurt at all.

[b]Update[/b] It has been eons since I wrote the above, and when I finally got around to playing San Juan anew, I find my thoughts on the game echoing the above to the letter. If anything the lack of variety bites even more anno 2016. Which probably explains why games like Race for the Galaxy took off so strongly: there's simply more to do there. San Juan is simple and straightforward, which is good... but it's also its Achilles' heel, because that is [i]all[/i] it is. Still, nice to have played again.

Very fun game that the wife is willing to play.  I'm using this one to prepare her for Puerto Rico.  This game in itself is a lot of fun too.

Played my first 5 or so games of this incorrectly.  We played that you had to produce using cards in your hand.  Once we fixed that issue, my wife now likes this game a lot more.

For many, Race Through the Galaxy has replaced this one.  But, this one is easier for most people to get into this type of game.  Especially for my family.

As far as tableau-builders go, this one is right in between The City and Race for the Galaxy complexity-wise. While it feels more "complete" than The City, it lacks some of the more intricate aspects of Race. Point- and action-engines are neither as complex nor as satisfying as in Race. On the plus side, this tends to be way more approachable for most people (no sci-fi, no icons, easier phases etc.).

RATING: 8
A very good medium-weight engine building/racing card game for small groups of players. Mechanically quite simple, but there are many strategic options available to players. It's all about building an engine of card combos, and will appeal to players who like that. The interaction between players is basically limited to the role selection, so it has a multiplayer solitaire feel to it (Puerto Rico is much more interactive). Inexperienced players are at very steep disadvantage until they learn all the cards and understand the combos possible, which can take many plays. The "churn rate" of cards is quite high - you'll usually shuffle the deck at least once during the course of a game - so there is a good chance that any particular card will at some point be in your hand.

The first edition suffers from some balance issues. The Guild Hall strategy is easy to execute and difficult for new players to counter, especially without the expansion cards that are included in the second edition. I don't care for the event cards from the expansion.

This has become a favorite over the course of the last year. The role-selection mechanic keeps you on your toes throughout the course of a game. I am just beginning to see how San Juan is far from multi-player solitaire.

Components: Very close to being just a straight-up card game. The score pad is nice, but a bit unnecessary; I would have preferred if the game came in an Amigo-sized card box. For the amount of action the cards see, they should be linen-finished. The artwork is nice. 

Experience: My opinion of this game has much improved since I first played it in 2004. Then I found it somewhat similar to Citadels, and was not yet inclined to enjoy production engine games. Now, of course, I find it more similar to Race for the Galaxy. San Juan might serve as a good gateway to RftG, with its simplified rule-breaking violet cards. Produce/trade restrictions and the hand limit keep cards very tight; it's crucial to find the right balance of violet cards to better piggy-back off the role selection. I'm not going to like this as much as RftG, but now I have a better sense of what people see in it.

Like 4 player: Someone will have to take production roles every round, but ultimately, the buildings aren't that exciting.

After playing Glory to Rome, this feels really shallow. A shadow of Puerto Rico and not nearly as good at GtR. I've also played Race for the Galaxy which has a more interesting theme, more wildly deviating player abilities and is just a better game all around.

RATING: 4
It's a good game, but I think it's overrated.  I believe that it would have an average rating on the Geek right around 6 if it wasn't related to Puerto Rico.  Just because "everyone" likes Puerto Rico doesn't automatically make this a great game.

I am not sure I like the angst of role selection in this style of game any longer.  It's hard to feel confident in any choice you make when you know you are helping your opponents out as well.  

This bugs me some about Puerto Rico, but San Juan compounds this feeling for me.  In San Juan, there are so many ways to offset the privilege of a particular role by building the right building, that you soon feel like there are no choices that help only you.  

As the game proceeds, any advantage you get for picking a particular role is very likely negated by someone else's building or buildings.  

The complexity of the interaction between the different buildings made me feel like the game was more analytical than I wanted it to be.  I prefer Citadels, where the analysis is less of a cold calculation.

I used to think San Juan strategies were kind of unbalanced. However, lately I have been trying a lot of different strategies and most of them are viable. One key I think is to play 3 player games. Production based strategies seem stronger with 3, and can be done in many different flavors. The game has really become a lot more interesting to me since then, and I love playing "oddball" production strategies against people who think "big purple" is the only way to win.

Calling it the "Puerto Rico card game" is selling it short. In many ways, San Juan is a brilliant design. Everything is done with cards - money, goods, buildings - and it works!

San Juan is a medium-light card game that has several interesting mechanics. The theme is about as boring as it gets. While San Juan is a good game it has been made totally obsolete for me by Race for the Galaxy. I got San Juan before Race but now I never touch it and have no reason to play it anymore. Still, San Juan is not bad.

Puerto Rico light. Card managing game. Plays fast and is quite challenging ! Although it looks like there's a lot of luck involved because it's a card game, there are in fact a lot of things to discover on how to get better at it. Excellent 45 minutes game.

Mostly harmless. Less confrontational, less brainpower and much more luck than Puerto Rico. I expect this game will be decent filler, but mostly forgotten and unplayed in a few years... 6 months later I am proven wrong. It is one of my most popular 2 player fillers with the following changes: removal of library, prefecture costs one more, and guildhall only scores for each type of production building. Upgraded it's rating by .5.

Update though I played this a lot RFTG wins out over this one for me, hands down. My wife prefers the non science fiction theme San Juan.

Ever since the first time I brought this game to a game night it has been requested at every game night since.  This is an instant classic for both my gaming group and my wife and I play it regularly at home.  It has even put its bigger brother Puerto Rico back on the shelf to collect dust.

RATING: 7.5
Nice card game based on the classic Puerto Rico. I like the mechanics of this game, however I fear that we won't play this much as my son prefers board games over card games (except for fillers like LoveLetter, BraveRats, etc.). Trading away to make room for other games.

A very good distillation of Puerto Rico into a card game.  There are a few quirks - the Guild Hall is too powerful as is the Prefecture and the Gold Mine just silly.  Otherwise, a very good card game.

RATING: 7
The mechanics are beautifully elegant and it features the same sense of 'developing a machine' that you get in Puerto Rico.

Familiarity with the cards seems essential though - since the game is largely all about choosing which card to prioritise - and knowing the potential future options can definitely affect that decision!

Excellent game of hand management. Works well with 2-4 although you may want to make a couple of small changes for two players. No real player interaction although role selection (a la Puerto Rico) does allow you to pick something else another player may need. Using cards in your hand as money to pay for buildings is brilliant and really makes hand management challenging.

One of my favorite games. There are several different valid strategies and adapting as the game goes on is key.

Excellent card game with nice depth of decisions. I escpecially like the Java internet version of this game for solo play. Considering the price and speed of play, makes a good addition to any collection.
UPDATE: several months later, this game holds its high rating. Highly replayable, and somewhat addictive with that one more game aspect. One thing I must deduct points for is that the theme does not grab people, so it can be hard to get them to invest the effort. A great addition if you have a Puerto Rico family.

I would rather play this than Puerto Rico, simply because it plays quicker and captures the theme almost as well. There are probably only 3-4 good strategies in this game though, so it lacks a little in variety.

Really liked this one. For what is basically a card game it plays with a surprising amount of strategy based on deciding which buildings to build and when. Seems complex on first read of he rules but things pick up quickly on first play through. Another good games to take on a trip due to the small number of parts.

Enjoyable game that is engaging and thought-provoking without being a chore.  There never seems to be enough cards in my hand for the building I want to build.  Roles are nice, but some are used way more than others in a 2-player game.  Good game to start out new players in order to later introduce them to Puerto Rico.  Scales well from 2-4 players.  Need more plays, as I always seem to forget to use the benefits of the buildings I have in play.
Not as fun as Race for the Galaxy, but much easier to learn (and teach).

This game is fun as a two person variant, and scales well through 4. Both times I have won at this game I was lucky? enough to get the city hall [the building that gives you two additional victory points for each production building] and just fill the rest of my 11 stalls up with cheap production stalls and a few monuments. So I was guaranteed at least 44 points for this combination. Seemed a bit too easy to go that route though?

Per 2-4 jugadors.
Es juga íntegrament amb cartes.
Partides relativament ràpides (< 60 min) i que poden ser encarades amb diferents estratègies.
La idea és construir el teu poble o ciutat, combinant Plantes de producció de recursos (cada recurs es vendrà més barat o més car en funció de l'estat del mercat) i Edificis que aportaran millores (permetran produir més, abaratir costos de construcció, etc).
Totes les cartes són d'edificis (urbans o centres de producció) però a la vegada s'usen com a 'monedes' de canvi, per pagar allò que vols construir.
A cada ronda, es passa el càrrec de governador al jugador següent i aquest escollirà un rol d'entre 5 disponibles (cada rol et permet fer unes o altres coses). Els demés jugadors escolliran els altres rols disponibles. Quan s'ha fet una ronda completa, el càrrec de Governador passa al següent jugador, i aquest escollirà el rol que desitgi (passant les cartes de rol restants als demés jugadors).
Molt recomanable.

A very clean design that is easy to teach and to play. Everyone should try this game.

I like the addition of a little card luck to the PR theme. Players are more likely to play fast & loose instead of analysing it to death. Its also easier to introduce to beginners since its simpler, more streamlined and looks less daunting than the myriad of PR components ("Hey its only a deck of cards!"). Like all card games, you need to play the hand you're dealt rather than any pre-planned strategy.

This game is very similar to Puerto Rico
but I feel it isn't quite as good due
to the fact that the random element plays
a much stronger role in this game.

it feel fresh and interesting.  It's
a quick play and doesn't require as

Bought my copy of San Juan at Amazon for ~14€. Will update my comment and add a rating once i've got some games under my belt.

[2008-08-12]
While my gaming group seems to have vanished and I'm eagerly looking for a new one, I'm killing some time with a San-Juan-Java-Implemention called JSanJuan. After about 20 to 30 games I have to say that I really like this game and so I updated my rating. It plays faster than Puerto Rico, there are other strategies and there is a nice, little addition of luck through the card draw. One thing I'm not so sure about is the replayability. There seem to be about two or three major strategies. Which one to choose and how well they execute depends on your card-draws. I'm not quite sure yet, if the game might get a bit repetitive after a while. Maybe Race for the Galaxy (RftG) might be the better choice when it comes down to replayability since both games share the core gameplay and from what I read here on the geek, there are far more possible strategies in RftG. But also after reading a ton of positive reviews for RftG, I can't convince myself to buy it because of the icons. So i think, I'll stick happily with San Juan for a while and update my rating again, once I've played the game face to face.

For some reason this didn't grab me.  Perhaps I was expecting PR the card game, and the differences grated me.  In any case, it would take special circumstances for me to play this again.

Enough like Puerto Rico that it makes learning the game easier.  Different enough that you can play both in the same evening, and not get bored.  Definitely a plus (for me) that SJ can be a two player game.

Well, not really unique since the release of RftG.

This is not a bad game, but it is overrated because of its relatedness to Puerto Rico. The only advantages over its big brother are shorter playing time and a better two player game, everything else is worse. Thus, I would always rather play Puerto Rico to scratch the same itch. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A couple of cards seemed a little over powered.  I won both times I played largely because I got that card (the one where you get 2 VP for every production building).  It's too bad because I really liked the simplicity of the game system.  My rating would be much higher if they balanced the cards.

--- EDIT ---
I've been playing the iOS version, and decided to update my comments based upon 10+ plays.  I was going to say that the cards are not very well balanced, but it looks like that's what I already though after my first 2 plays!

Rating based on 1580 plays (give or take a dozen).  Do I need to say more?  Well, OK, I will.  The game is all about making the most of what you are dealt.  It is much more balanced when you understand the interactions among the different cards.  Different game with 2 than 3 or 4.  When I play and someone suggests a variation such as no library, I laugh because I likely won't build it anyway (unless I'm swimming in otherwise sucky cards early in the game).  There is no single card that is all powerful (IMO Prefecture approaches this in a 4 player game).  Gold mine adds a little more luck to it, but the luck is manageable most of the time.  My favorite 2 player game.  Get it.  Play it.  Love it.

Took a few games to warm up to this one, but then I guickly got bored.  On the plus side, it's a reasonably good introduction to the role-selection genre.  but I'll always go with Citadel over this one (more roles and increased player interaction).

This does not have the subtlety of Puerto Rico, but retains some of the feel of its progenitor, though with considerably more luck. The shorter play and the fact that it can accommodate 2 players quite happily means it is already seeing more regular play than Puerto Rico and the great variety of buildings available offer considerable scope for exploring different strategies in the game, ensuring it will see a lot more play. A very solid 9 for me.

Fun game. Not as good as Puerto Rico.  Rating may go down with repeated plays though if luck factor is high, and winning strategies reveal themselves as limited.

I tried out San Juan after having played and enjoyed Race For the Galaxy for quite a while. My main response to the game was, "Thats it?"

Quality Puerto Rico spin-off game.  The "choosing the role" mechanic remains, but now there are only five roles.  Cards are either money (when in hand), Buildings (when on table) or goods (when on production Building).  Lots of good stuff to think about when juggling what card to use as money/building.  Plays very cleanly and quickly.  Rating up from 8 to 9 after 20 games.

I play this quite frequently with my partner, it makes a great lunch hour game.  There are not many different strategies to explore, but you don't always have a choice and need to work with what you draw.  There isn't anything especially amazing about this game, but it has interesting decisions and a nice relaxing flow to it.  I was about to bump the rating down as we had started to get bored with the limited amount of winning strategies, but we just picked up the Treasure Chest expansion, which adds additional strategies.

Update: after a bit of a break I've played this again and continue to appreciate it more, especially with the expansion.  I would rate this an 8 without the expansion and 9 with it.

Awesome hand-management game with plenty of varied strategies. It plays very fast and the decisions are easier, so there's a lot less paralysis and deducing if-then scenarios. The interactions are great, and I am surprised that people are unfairly trashing this great, short-playing offering. I an exciteded to try out more combos myself and see how they interact!

At one time, I would have ranked this in my top 5 card games.  After 20+ logged plays (I know I've played it more than that), I am left craving "Race"!  Aside, I think knowing how to play Puerto Rico gives you a definate leg-up (and vice-versa!).

San Juan is, at its core, Puerto Rico, while still being its own game -- rather than taking the place of PR it complements PR nicely. It's kinda like a deep filler -- it plays quickly (unusally around 30 minutes for us) but doesn't feel like fluff. I think the way my wife described San Juan is perfect -- "It's a game where your strategy is determined by the luck of the draw."

This fast clever game is one of the quickest (25 mins per game) ways for me to quench my thirst for strategy. As an added bonus, my wife loves it!

It is what the box says: the card version of Puerto Rico. Very streamlined and easy to teach/play. Reminds me of Glory to Rome. Although I have to say GtR beats San Juan in consequential choices and interaction more. San Juan is ALMOST solitaire. Could be a good game to gauge people's interest in GtR though. This or Uchronia.

A very streamlined version of puerto rico - takes some of the same concepts - creating a strategy and maintaining a balance of growth/spending. Very elegant use of cards as both money and as chits. Quick playing time makes up for the bigger luck factor compared to its big brother.

It's basically the lightest game in the Puerto Rico/San Juan/Race for the Galaxy/Roll for the Galaxy lineage. Can't complain about its simplicity, it's a nice intro to the series.

RATING: 5
The multiple-use cards are a cool mechanism, but might give a kind of genericness to the game.  It is much more random than Puerto Rico and so more lightweight and casual.  You have to figure out your strategy from what you draw.  From my playings, the Guild Hall seems very strong. Also, with 2 or 3 players it is an uninteresting pattern of picking from the same 2 or 3 roles every turn.  Not very interactive, seems like multiplayer solitaire.

Goes hand-in-hand with Race for the Galaxy and/or Puerto Rico. If you like either of those games, you'll probably like San Juan.

This game is definitely easier to teach than Race for the Galaxy, but the people who will be turned off by RftG will still be put off at the end when you beat them 35-18 and they don't understand why: Because they haven't played RftG 10 times like you have.

Hosszú idő után vettük elő, a magyarított, és kártyagyáras rethematizált SJ-t. (Rhethema: hát határeset. Nem rossz, nem rossz, de a tényleg magyar SJ jobban összerakott: témailag, na de ugye az nem rendelhető, de persze magyarul SEM kapható...). Na de ami a lényeg: A Filosofia oldalán találtam egy linket, és hivatalos szabályt is 5-8 fősségre. 2 pakli kell hozzá, meg pár új szerep. Szuper. Ezt is megcsináltattam pluszba.
És megvolt a próba: az újra előkerülés egyben 6 személyes játékot hozott. És működik!
Nyilván nőtt a játék idő: mégiscsak 6 fő a 4 helyett. De nem lett élvezhetetlen, sőt. Izgalmas maradt, hossza is megfelelő (de nem rövid!: nekünk kb 2 óra volt. előtte mivel nem volt szétválogatva rendesen a pakli, sajnos volt fél óra válogatás, átszervezés, ez orvosolva, legközelebb nincs ilyen. Ugyanakkor a 2 órához még: ismerve a társaságot a 4 fős játék is 1,5 óra lenne, így valóban nem sokkal hosszabb).
És ugye azt se felejtsük: az eredeti SJ is könnyedebb verziója a PR-nek, ez is megmaradt.
És akkor az SJ:
szerepválasztásos, eggyel több szerep mint játékos, 1 forduló: szerepválasztás, a szerep lejátszása, a választó elébb aztán mindenki más ha akarja, a választó plusz kiváltságot kap. Majd köv. játékos választ a maradékból szerepet. Miután mindenki választott szerepet a forduló véget ér, minden szerep visszakerül. És új forduló.
A kártya lehet pénz -ha fizetünk, lehet termény, ha termelünk, lehet áru eladáskor, és persze lehet épület, amit megépítünk. Ez utóbbi a fontos: ebből van pont a játék végén. Minden épületnek van pontértéke.
Amikor vki megépíti a 12. épületét, a játék véget ér, pontszámolás jön.
Az épület: a termelőépületek (csak termelnek.)
vagy b: különlege3s -lila- épületek. ez utóbbiak többnyire adnak vmi spec tulajdonságot: többet termelhetsz, többet adhatsz el, 2x jössz, több lapod lehet, stb.
összesen 24 féle lila épület: abból 17nek spec tulajdonsága. 3 emlékmű, és 4 spec pontokat ad. 
Még mindig szeretem, sőt kap magasabb pontot is: az h 6-an is játszható: megérdemli.

I played San Juan 5 times. A 2 player game in person once. The other times were four player games.

I really need to look at what I build during the game as buildings is concerned. It is easy to forget to pick to extra cards which you have access. It's not easy to track everything each turn. I guess I need to play San Juan more often to get use to it. You really need to pay attention on what you are doing. Can make a difference from winning and losing

Some buildings are better than others. Don't know if there are really killer combo's in San Juan. Need to play San Juan more often to test the buildings more.

"It's just like Puerto Rico, only SHORTER!" OK, this is supposed to get me to play? 

In truth, I probably like this better than PR, since the random card draw prevents the game from becoming too formalized. Still, it's an exercise in learning which are the good cards and which are the ones to "spend".

I hesitated purchasing this game for about a year thinking that I didn't need a watered down version of Puerto Rico. That was a mistake.

This game has some of the same ideas behind it, but plays very differently. Unlike Tigris and Euphrates or Caylus Magna Carta, this game really tries to do something that is card based. Seyfarth succeeded brilliantly and I hope expansions are forthcoming.

It's great in the fact that it's easy to teach and play.  It also goes relatively quick and people constantly picking roles keeps things interesting with little downtime.  The random factor of the game is a little bothersome and the Guild Hall seems a little overpowered in my opinion.  If you're going to try Race for the Galaxy, you will probably want to play this game first to get used to the concept of the game.  I say this because Race for the Galaxy replaced San Juan for me and have some mechanisms in common.

Received in trade 5/26/11.

First play 6/25/11 with my husband.  I found it so-so.  I don't know if my expectations were too high, or that this title just requires more plays to enjoy it.  The reason I found it so-so, was that I found it repetitive and a bit boring.  Maybe when we know the cards better?  I'm not really happy about this right now!  :(

2nd play 7/4/11 with my husband.  It was a bit better.  My issue with this game is that, while sort of interesting, it does not challenge me and I find that I can easily win with minimal effort.  Regardless of what my husband does, I can counteract it and still outscore him.  Not exciting at all.  I rated it as I have very little desire to play again.

FOR TRADE.

Played 3-player on 12/25/12.  2 new players.  Still very meh for me and the new players were not thrilled either.  The gameplay gets pretty repetitive.

Traded for TZAAR 9/4/13.

Yes!
After years of struggle with RftG, I can finally see the light!! After getting bloodied time and again by the Keldon AI, I can enjoy playing a card game with very similar lines, but certainly shallower, and it is perhaps more fun because of it. Is a win more satisfying in RftG? Perhaps. But there's a lot less trauma with San Juan. Honestly, they are so similar, it's kind of ridiculous, but SJ is FAR more scrutable than Race, and thematically as laid back as the Caribbean its self.  

Frankly, they're both great games, but SJ is going to be easier to get to the table, and require less gray matter at the end of a hard day. Get both!

Played this for the first time after playing Race for the Galaxy a hundred times. Conclusion: painfully slow and restricting compared to RftG. I also find the iconography of RftG to be better than the text of San Juan's cards (even though you'll probably learn the buildings quite fast). The worst thing is the restricting feel of role selection.

San Juan is a thematic game about city building. It works well with two and more players and offers many opportunities to develop good play strategies. First me and my fiancee were stuck with the Guild hall syndrome, but after some plays we found out that there's so much more to it than that! This is a proof of the longevity San Juan has to offer. Downside is that there is not much direct player interaction, but it is there, disguised in the role selection mechanics.

One of the best games I know for 2 players and usually works very well with 3 or 4 players too (although sometimes can occur that someone never sees any 6 point cards if played with more than 2 players).

Being a Puerto Rico zealot, I was surprised that I didn't hate this game. It does away with many of my favorite parts of its board game counterpart, but it breaks out of the mold enough to feel more like a card game in the Puerto Rico universe, rather than Puerto Rico: the Card Game. The various new buildings, and tweaked roles keep this game both familiar and distinct. I won't play much, but I won't renounce it either.

The cards serving as money, buildings, and goods makes for an excellent mechanic. I also like the face-down discard pile. Plays best at two or three, [-]four ain't too bad either[/-] I'd rather play Race for the Galaxy for four. 
 
Along with Battle Line and Race for the Galaxy, it's amazing how a good system can make a card-based game so skill driven.

[2 plays] The missing link between Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy.  Or as I'd put it, a PR-themed English-language version of RftG.  San Juan is OK, but I think I'd rather play PR.  The main feeling San Juan gave me was thankfulness that I wasn't having to play RftG.

"75% the fun of PUERTO RICO in 50% of the time"

Card game variation of Puerto Rico, lighter in tone, easier, and quicker. It's an exercise in economic logistics, with different paths to victory (eg production strategy?  monument strategy?  other?), and the idea is to find optimum synergy between cards with unique abilities.  Requires good decision making, and very enjoyable with 2-4, especially with three (with four players it can come down to who draws the "six point" cards).

I liked this one for a bit at first but playing on BSW ruined it for me as the sharks would win every time with the "build anything" strategy. Basically, you build something each turn and rush the game to a quick, 12 turn end. It removes what little strategy there is in saving up to play an endgame card that complements your strategy. I keep around as it's small enough on the shelf, but even for a gateway I prefer London at this point. And clearly Race for the Galaxy is a much more sophisticated and interesting take on the card game version of Puerto Rico. I had my fun of the game, but not sure where it fits in anymore.

In my opinion, this game is better than Puerto Rico.  Bonus for being portable.  My favorite aspect of the game is the resource/hand management aspect where your cards in hand can also act as resources to play cards from your hand.  Always feels like there is a tough decision to make but not so random that it's all tactical decisions.  Also, this game is great for introducing new people to the hobby - I consider this a second step game (not necessarily a gateway game)

I've played this a with two players a ton of times. It's a pretty solid game and maybe better than PR because it can be finished in 20 minutes. Of course, the guild hall is too freakin' powerful and if you don't get it and the other player does, the game is over. I've only played with 3 players once and the game seemed fun, but frustrating. Again, guild hall ruled the day. Any thoughts on how to balance this out?

San Juan is a fascinating and addictive game that plays quickly and is quite engaging.   There seem to be several pathways to victory.  Part of the fun is deciding which pathway to take based on the first couple of turns as there are specific buildings and building combos that with experience drive the approach that one will take.

update: upgraded from 7 to 8.5 after 14 plays as it just becomes better and better as you begin to understand the game flow and card combinations.

update: added the new buildings from the Treasure Chest expansion after about 40 plays.  They are great and add new life and options to this already great game.  Still going strong here and San Juan is my wife's second all-time favorite game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There are some initial teaching hurdles in San Juan, but after learning how a face-down card constitutes a "good" that must be produced, and subsequently sold, to obtain more cards (which also function as both buildings and money!), play is quick and painless.

Everyone gets to play on everyone else's turn (provided they don't select the "Prospector" role, but even then!). This means all players are involved all the time. This engagement keeps every turn interesting and dynamic. There's a number of choices for strategy, and it is especially rewarding seeing your plays pay off on future turns.

There is little direct interaction with other players, but which role you select directly benefits them. The trick is choosing roles that help you more, and counting on others to choose the roles you didn't that you neglected but that you nonetheless need. Reading the table is key, and keeps the spirit of competition alive.

Overall a really fun game that isn't too heavy for newer gamers or too light for older gamers.

* Played 5+ times. I don't think this game is very good with 2p, but it is fun with 3p, which is my least favorite number to play Puerto Rico with. Having said that, this really is a beer-and-pretzels game. Those who like the nasty indirect interaction of Puerto Rico will find little of that here. It is just denying a card to a player here or there, and therefore players seem to build buildings at roughly the same speed. This game for it's price is severely overhyped. A fairly interesting card game that uses some ideas from Puerto Rico, but is largely a solitaire exercise. [o-s]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
For many non-gamers, the cards take too long to read and become familiar with. Unfortunately, players need to know what cards are in the deck.  So now when I explain the rules, I pick out only the most important cards to briefly review.  Then we play.  I give myself a handicap by forgoing the use of the purple cards I have built. (For example, The Smithy allows the building of a production card for 1 less cost.)  I explain what I normally get for the played card.  Scores end up pretty close.  The 2nd game, I forgo use of the purple cards built on the top row only.  The third game is a full game since they are familiar enough with the cards by then.

San Juan is a lot harder to win than Puerto Rico because of the bigger luck element based on the draw of the cards--which wins/loses will be more even--the better player will win a little more often but there is less control over the game than in Puerto Rico.  but then this is a much faster game too.

As my wife and I discover more games, this is one that we're wanting to play less.  Still, I'd gladly pull it out anytime, and it definitely holds a special place as one of our first (albeit lighter) "gamer" games. It's like Thanksgiving dinner: you know what to expect, but it always satisfies. Almost all of our plays are two-player: the one time we played with three, we didn't find it to be a significantly different experience.

Courtesy of Hawkeye77, we also have the expansion cards included in the [thing=40688]Alea Treasure Chest[/thing]. We really enjoy it. I had concerns about using the Cathedral in a two-player game, but it's fine.

RATING: 6
Very simple manifestation of the Puerto Rico/Race for the Galaxy mechanic.

There is less tempo control (game only ends after building 12 cards), only one phase scores points (building, instead of Dev/Settle/Consume), it accommodates a narrower range of players, there are far fewer types of buildings, and victory depends critically on playing the large buildings. The role selection forces you to read ahead and track the way player order jumps around, which is okay in moderation but not the kind of thing I like to do.

Rftg has more "colour": many more unique cards, many more types of potentially interlocking bonuses, starting positions are asymmetric, and there are many more ways to victory.

  San Juan keeps your hands busy as you churn through cards, shuffle, grab role tokens and discard and draw constantly.  For the most part everyone does all this together and the game keeps up a very active pace.  I like the random luck of the shuffle in San Juan and it's a game you can study and think about when not playing.  My 10 and 11 year old daughters as well as my game group enjoy this game.  It's a bonus that it's as portable and nicely produced as well!  I have many plays of this game ahead of me.  

Update:  Race for the Galaxy blows this game away.   More card combos and more depth.

RATING: 7
Maybe I'm just used to playing Race for the Galaxy, but there's a lot less layers here.  Still, it's very enjoyable and quick even if the play seems comparatively obvious to its newer sibling.  My wife really likes it and I enjoy playing it together.  Definitely my favorite game for that purpose.  Hopefully she'll eventually get over the theme and she'll request RftG more.

Not Puerto Rico. A bit of the flavor, but also seems monotonous after you know what the good buildings are.

I like this game, it's basically a lighter version of Race for the Galaxy. The card variety is too low though, so there is a limited number of strategies.

RATING: 8.5
I love Puerto Rico but for some reason I was hesitant to buy this when it came out. I played it once on BSW right away and it just didn't click. After finally getting it now and playing several games, I must say that this is an excellent game. It has a lot of the flavor of Puerto Rico, but it's a completely different game. It plays in about 30 minutes and gives you plenty to think about in that time. I love the way the cards act as buildings, goods, and money all at the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Take the variable role selection of Puerto Rico, marry it with a card game where cards = money = special powers = victory points, and you have San Juan. It's significantly more luck-driven than its older brother, but it plays so quickly and has more than enough roads to victory that it remains interesting. Definitely in the "let's play that again" category of filler games, with more depth than you'd expect from a filler. Recommended. ***Update: Knocked SJ down another notch, to 6, as it's already wearing out its welcome after around 35+ plays. ***UPDATE: Played a few games after St. Pete crashed and burned. I like SJ more than I like St. Pete, because the card interaction and combinations are more interesting than the investment/return dynamics of St. Pete. However, neither game seems to have the staying power of a Modern Art or RA or even a LOTR: the Confrontation in 2P mode.

I thought I'd be disappointed with it because we're used to Puerto Rico, and I'd heard complaints, but I was actually pleasantly surprised. It's a light hand management game version of it, but what it does, it does well. I think I'd tire of it if we played it too often, but it's a good option for the lighter gaming crowd

RATING: 6
We happened on a strong strategy early and there don't seem to be many alternatives. We may not have exhausted the responses well enough yet, but no one seems to be able to beat the player who gets the field/building bonus card and rushes the end with cheap bonus fodder. We enjoyed the first few plays though, and I've heard that the small expansion drastically improves the card balance. Worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First impression was "PR lite...what's the point".  With a few more plays there is great skill in making the best of the cards one is dealt.... but unfortunately everything comes down to the draw of the '6' bonus cards in the end

RATING: 10
Very nice.  It strips down Puerto Rico, which I find unnecessarily complex.  Plays quick, nice art.  There are fewer choices, but it is a happy two to four player strategy game.  The multiple use of the cards (buildings, money, AND products) is quite cool.  The more I play it, the more I like.  I do always lose, but it's fast and fun.

After even more plays: this one is swiftly becoming one of my favorite games ever.  I never quite "got" Puerto Rico.  This, I get.  Oh, I get it.  Fun.

A fun game, but if you like the game mechanic, go with Race for the Galaxy instead.

I want to add a caveat to the statement above, however. This game is great for younger gamers who are too young for Race for the Galaxy. My 9-year-old daughter asks for this one frequently.

Great game!  Fun and interesting without the usual conflict.  Also seems to avoid the usual kingmaker problem (after 6 plays).  Perhaps too much --as it is tough to stop someone in the lead.  We love this game and it is a nice alternative to settlers.

O jogo é atraente pelo fato de ser baseado no Puerto Rico (PR). Mesmo tema, arte semelhante, talvez melhor, em fim, agrada aos olhos. A mecânica é escolha de ações. Construção, produção, comércio, exportação, mineração. [gameid=3076]. É um ótimo jogo para introduzir o conceito de jogos de carta (Jogos de carta baseado em jogos de tabuleiro), especialmente, por causa da comunicação visual do jogo. As cartas de ação são de cor e formatos diferentes, as cartas de edifícios de produção e violetas tem cores diferentes e o verso das cartas (recurso) é de outra cor. Facilita muita a explica e entendimento para novos jogadores. Gostei, apesar de ser um cardgame. Evidentemente, senti falta das peças de mercadorias, pontos e dinheiro, afinal é um cardgame! Também achei que o peso sorte maior que no PR, devido a retirada aleatória de cartas, mas é um jogo legal de se jogar. Se for para jogar um cardgame é esse. Recomendo.

San Juan gets rave reviews from my non-gamer friends, more so than most of my other favorites. That's kind of surprising since I think of San Juan as having relatively little raw amusement value... to me it's more about calculation and efficiency.

RATING: 7
Not as good as PR, seems somewhat luck driven since some cards feel unbalanced early in the game (library). Also, some strategy seem more powerful than others, but I have to check this. Overall, a couple of good ideas. UPDATE: Recent games have been better, rating went up by 1 point.

Quick to set-up, quick to play. Fun for my wife and I when we don't want to take time to set-up Puerto Rico. She usually has about a dozen cards under the chapel by the end of the game and not much else going for her. While I usually end the game by building the 12th building. Whomever builds the 12th building usually wins, makes this game almost a race to the finish.

My wife says this is one of her favorite game.

Régóta ki szerettem volna már próbálni, végre sikerült. Nem nyűgözött le, de nem is volt rossz. Kicsit kevésnek érzem a kombinációs lehetőségek számát benne, és az a baj, hogy a gyors, taktikai/stratégiai kártyajátékoknál nagyon erős a mezőny. Érzésem szerint nem ér fel sem a 7 wonders, sem a Dicsőség Rómának szintjére.

RATING: 6
I've gone back and forth a lot in my feelings on this game. I know some people who like it even better than Puerto Rico, and in comparison, well, you just can't beat San Juan's setup and cleanup time. But I do think the game is a little too narrow, and Race for the Galaxy expands on it in quite successfully, so that now I kind of can't play San Juan and be totally satisfied.

San Juan is in many ways a massively simplified Race for the Galaxy. It has none of the sometimes overbearing iconography, but also none of the various unique card combinations.

The cards are probably the game's biggest weakness. There is little to really distinguish oneself from other players, and a few buildings are simply so much better options than others that choices border on playing on autopilot.

RATING: 7.5
Great game but my rating has gone down for two reasons.  One, the game is now outclassed by the more recent 'Race to the Galaxy' game.  Two, San Juan has some card balance problems which should have been corrected in the playtest stage.  Still fun to play.

It's fun, a great way to teach the role-selection mechanic of Puerto Rico, but I find I get tired of it quickly. Maybe I'm missing some strategic depth, but there are a lot of cards I just think are useless most of the time. I guess they make good currency.

RATING: 4
I think Glory to Rome completely outclasses this game. So does Race for the Galaxy. Get one of those instead.

Has a nice level of complexity.  I like setting up your own sort of engine for scoring points with every game.  It is also nice in that you don't directly harm your opponents ( ie "lose a card"), you just have to plan around them.  Because of this, the game is less antagonizing.

My friend and I figured out a strategy and haven't lost using yet. So I would recommend Puerto Rico instead of this for people who like to take apart their games.

I sold this game in 2014 after purchasing it around 2005-6.

It's refreshing to play this after spending so much time wrapping my brain around RftG. Race does a couple of things better (Victory tokens and the specified order of play works better thematically), but I enjoy the straightforward approach of San Juan. One thing that I thought could be done better is the way that the value for goods is decided each round. there is something just boring about flipping a stacked long rectangle. I know it's petty, but even a square shape would have felt... I don't know... less precariously stacked?

Received in the mail - 4/6/04. Have now played it over 30 times. It remains one of my standard fillers. I think it is one of the few games that plays just as well with any number from 2 -4 (one set) or with 5-8 (two sets). This alone makes it a valuable game to own. Not a deep game, but a great filler, but with enough to do that you don't feel it's a "little" game. So, you won't hear me calling it a "great little filler." I call it one of the few "great meaty fillers."

San Juan is a fantastic card game that captures the spirit of Puerto Rico accurately.  There are many options available throughout the game.  Having to use powerful cards as money instead makes this a real nail-biter.  There are powerful card combinations that you can look out for, but the game doesn't penalize you for experimenting with different attempts at point-gathering.  Just make sure you keep a close eye on your opponents, and can keep up with any point grabs they have set out for themselves!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After playing RftG, San Juan just seems flat.  Removing shipping from the Puerto Rico recipe simplifies the game just a little too much.  Additionally, some cards (such as the Library) may be too powerful, while others are always used as money (ie the Crane).

On the plus side, the game is a wonderful stepping stone towards Race or Puerto Rico (and maybe Glory to Rome?), which are excellent games.

But now I find Puerto Rico drags a bit if things aren't going my way, and I'm drawn back to the simplicity of San Juan.

Initially I prefered San Juan to it's big brother.  However, with recent plays of Puerto Rico putting a new sheen on the old game my preferance is changing.  San Juan plays as a light version of Puerto Rico but through card play.  The mechanic that cards substitute for all game components (money, buildings, trade goods) is elegantly pieced together.  The quicker playing time makes this more available, but not as deep.

Fun game that a lot of people love and for good reason, it is a great game. That said, this game was like Dominion for me, even though they are totally different games. I just found myself in a rut of using the same strategy and it just lost its appeal. Obviously that is my fault, but I was winning so I had no reason to change. Also my wife and I felt that the 2 player game had some issues which was primarily why I bought the game originally. We now have many great 2 player games and for all the reasons above, this one left our collection to find a better home.

iPad version: San Juan is very fun with any amount of players, which I find to be a very rare quality in a game. I love how the cards that score victory points or get more cards into your hand are also the currency used to be able to play the cards to the table; creating some difficult choices and risk. The selecting of professions in each round also adds strategies used to limit the amount of cards your opponents can get or play. These mechanics add up to some tense rounds and a great game.

I got the sense that it does not affect the game as much as a newbie affects Puerto Rico. I liked the game and would play it again.

Moving into playing San Juan from card games like Lost Cities. My favorite thing: no analysis paralysis like in  Lost Cities, when you don't want to discard or play anything, slowing the game down tremendously. In San Juan, the decisions are more numerous and never agonizing.

San Juan is a lot of fun. It's light and easy to learn, teach, and play, yet still maintains a good amount of thought and strategy. Each turn is satisfying, there is no downtime because everyone takes their actions at once. The first few times playing through is awesome getting a sense of all the different buildings. It's often hard to choose which to building to lay down, as you have to pay for it with other building cards in your hands(the buildings double as 'gold'). Just plain fun, hard to turn down this one.

This game gets played a whole lot, simply because it's fast, easy to teach, good with 2, 3, or 4 players, and extremely portable (for instance, some friends and I will play it at a fast food joint over our lunch break).  It also doesn't hurt that it's based on the very popular "Puerto Rico", one of my favorites.

Very addictive when I first played this game. But it becomes stale after playing about 80-100 times.

2-player is tight and plays very differently than 3 or 4 players.
3-player is not very balanced and not much room for different paths to victory.
4-player is more balanced and there are multiple viable paths to victory.

The short game length makes many cards useless because there will not be enough time to get the proper return on investment.

The same mechanics as in Race for the Galaxy but executed in a lot more elegant way. Less card types which makes the game more accesible to a casual player, a great franchise (Puerto Rico) and simple rules. All that makes a very good replacement (or at least addition) to R4tG.

In my opinion San Juan is very underhyped - it's a great game on its own and it's defintely worth knowing.

RATING: 7
Card and much lighter version of Puerto Rico - select roles to maximise your cards from which to select and place buildings into play and which also represent the currency of the game. Plays quickly and scales well up to 4 players. There is an element of luck in the draw of the cards with some being better than others, but the deck will likely cycle a couple of times in a game giving everyone enough access to cards and the games are quick. Good components.

RATING: 7
I thought I was doing well, but in the end, I was destined for failure.  Even so, it is a fun ride.  Nice choices in terms of what cards you keep and what card you 'spend' in order to build.  Considering how often the deck needs to be shuffled, it would have been great if the cards were of the same quality as the cards in many of the Amigo small box card games for example.

Update: Our game yesterday ended in record time.  I have no idea why, but I won't complain because I ended up sharing a victory.

Much more enjoyable than Puerto Rico, because it is not as analyzed.  You can play a sensible game with people and not be criticized for every mistake by the people who have devoted their lives to PR.  More random, but that means it will be less analyzable in the long run and more enjoyable for me.  You still have to work the combinations available in the cards you have, so it's not as fluffy as claimed by those who scoff at it.  This time I will remember (unlike PR) not to get bogged down by the people who play endless hours on BSW and dissect the game, and will just enjoy the game itself.

I bought this after falling in love with Race For The Galaxy. I thought this would be a good similar, but simpler alternative for shorter games.  But it doesn't appeal to me anywhere near as much as RftG.  Not a bad game, but not what I was really looking for.  It hardly ever gets played any more.

delightful game to play, but I'd hesitate to call it the 'card version' of PR. It's a light to medium card game that retains the turn structure and some of the roles of PR, but with too many changes to really call it a different version of PR. If you like PR, and have the attitude that this game simply has a PR flavor to it, then you will probably enjoy San Juan.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
San Juan uses the now-traditional "everyone-chooses-a-different-phase" technique common to El Grande, Race For the Galaxy and many others.  Since this is meant to at least slightly mimic real life, I object to the idea that an action chosen by one player can not be chosen by another player.  If you don't get your economy (number of cards being received and used each turn) going early, you may as well forget it.  This is a much simpler and fairer game than it's parent game Puerto, which is even more dependent on an early working economy and therefore not worth ever playing.  While it appears kind of balanced, in reality you need cards that go well together.  The chance of that are small.  Also, since there are very few ways to earn victory points, you are dependent on getting those cards that earn you large points.  There is a large enough deck that you can almost entirely miss seeing any of those cards for the entire game.  Some cards are way too strong and should be diluted.  While you can have fun playing San Juan, it doesn't measure up to my standards of fairness and thus I tend to balk at playing it.

I'm a huge Puerto Rico fan.  I like RFTG a lot.

It's not either of those.

For me, it's really a two player game that I play with my wife, and it's good in that regard.  It's not quite a filler game, but it feels like that to me, so it seems to struggle to find a home for me outside of a 2p game.

I like it enough though, and I like that I can store it all in a 100 card case that I've tried to put most of my card games in.  small, compact, very little shelf space.

This game is like Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy mixture. Works quite well, however not so strategically deep as Race for the Galaxy and not so thematical as Puerto Rico, however San Juan plays fast and smooth and is well made. Suitable as a warm-up game or fast two-player game instead of Puerto Rico. Race for the Galaxy for two players would be better choice, however San Juan has the Puerto Rico's theme and some of it's elements (buildings, role play), so I'll keep this game together with more attractive games Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy copies.

RATING: 4
The primary innovation of Puerto Rico, the role selection system, is less exciting and less important here.  San Juan is much more about hand management: getting a good influx of cards, choosing which cards to build and in what order, and knowing which cards to give up and which ones to save.  Some cards work well for almost anyone and others require other synergistic cards or specific strategies in order to be effective.  There's a bit of a learning curve in figuring out what works and what doesn't, but overall the game is more forgiving and less intimidating for beginners than Puerto Rico.  The central mechanism of cards-as-buildings-or-cash works well, although it creates the need for an awful lot of drawing, discarding, and shuffling. 

My chief complaint is that San Juan feels disappointingly solitaire-ish in comparison to Puerto Rico.  Yeah, your role choice will have some effect on the others.  But mostly the same roles are selected each turn because there are fewer roles overall and no incentive to choose the neglected ones.  This reduces player interaction and makes each turn feel the same as the last.  The other factors that create interaction in Puerto Rico are mostly missing here:  there's no competition for ships, an unlimited supplies of goods, no goods spoilage, unlimited use of the trading house, and no commonly available pool of buildings.  What we're left with is a game that's all about managing your hand, finding the powerful cards and/or the right combos, and building an engine to churn and play as many cards as possible.  San Juan was pleasant for several games, but I think I'm done with it.  A final note: the Library should be removed for two-player matches.

After one play...I'm not sure how I feel about this game.  It was difficult to measure the worth of cards since they are also used as money, plus I did not know what the cards do for you until I saw them in my hand.  So, the jury is still out on this.  I might really like it once I figure it out!  Most importantly, I did enjoy it after 1 play.

This is a great little card game version of Puerto Rico that in several ways I actually prefer to PR. It plays more quickly and offers a lot of different routes to victory. The learning curve doesn't seem as steep, and new players aren't at as big a disadvantage as they are in PR. It also works quite well with just two players.

RATING: 8
We've settled in on removing the Libaries and reducing the Guild Hall bonus to 1 point per Production card. It now feels that the number of strategies has opened up and choice of strategies depends on what cards you're getting and how your opponent is building. Essentially, it feels like a richer 2-player game with the modifications we've made. 

We've now played it over 100 times and we're still nearly even with neither of us ever getting much more than 4 games ahead. We have made one alteration to the rules: The Guild Hall only gives One point (instead of two) for each resource card. Otherwise the Guild Hall was too powerful. 

We've now played it nearly 40 times and it's our current favorite. My wife and I are dead even at 20 games a piece. 

Very cool first two games. It satisfied all the criteria and was lots of fun. And it totally smokes the similar Citadels as a 2-player game.

This game isn't actually mine, it belongs to my younger brother, and was a gift to him from my older brother...However I have to thank both of them for bringing it to my attention.  This game really got me into modern board games, though it took a while.  Also, if I had never played this game, I likely would have never gotten into playing Race for the Galaxy, which is currently my favourite game.  This game is also only great after a few plays and then gets more boring over time because of the limited strategies.  RftG really blows it out of the water.

RATING: 7
Good simple game.

Each turn, you pick a role, get the bonus it provides and the main action while the other players only do the main action if they want.

The downside of this game is that you really need to be four players to enjoy it fully.

It's one of the few simple games I like.

I like that this game is relatively easy to pick up and teach to others. But, it takes many, many plays to master. There are several different ways to win, with the Monuments, Guild Hall, City Hall, and Palace playing a large roll in guiding your choice of cards to build. I can see this game playing in less than a half an hour once all players know all the cards, and start playing a strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The simple and well designed system, based on role selection and supported by many different buildings, manages to translate some of the "Puerto Rico" experience to the card game format. At the same time, it feels a little like "Citadels" without the messing with the other players. Using the building cards themselves as money is a nice idea and creates some agonizing decisions. However, the game still has the luck inherent to card draws. You may get behind or take a good lead depending on the cards you get early in the game, and a few can be too powerful. Reshuffling may be annoying, and the theme is still extremely dull, of course. At least this time we get pictures for the buildings.

I played this game many times, just to find out that it is pretty much luck-dependent. Also, the main part is decided by your starting cards. If you try to get around your starting cards, you lose time and will lose the game.

Also, there are only 2 strategys available, using production or buildings and the buildings have a slight advantage. All in all, it depends on the cards you will draw and got in your starting hand.

It´s not a bad game in any way, but it´s not as deep as it may seem at first glance.

I love this quick card game.  So many different strategies.  None of the cards are broken, although if you don't pull a 6 pointer you may be out of luck, then again it may be because your opponent hogged them all.

Picked this up as a gateway game for my girlfriend to Galaxies and it worked - hurrah! For that, I will always be grateful to San Juan.

A neat, clever game that lacks a soul and the variety of cards to keep it interesting.

I suspect that I was expecting too much from this game. I finally got to play it this weekend and to be honest I was rather underwhelmed. 

There is even less player interaction than in Puerto Rico and because you can only build from a very limited collection of cards there is a significant degree of luck of the draw.

After my first playings of PR I was constantly thinking about ideas for strategies. San Juan on the other hand has left me thinking if I can possibly use it as a way to get people to play PR.

I have now played several more times, while there is some strategy there is a lot of luck of the draw. There are some cards that I have never seen in my hand. 

After some more plays I have uprated my opinion slightly. This is a game I am happy to play but I still feel that there is not a huge amount of control from a player point of view.

RATING: 8
Mostly 2 player games but probably six of them are 3 or 4 player. Depends quite a bit on the cards you get but decent tactical playing of those cards makes a big difference. Always pretty tight to get things done and keep what you need to keep. Vastly preferable to Puerto Rico.

Good game with limited choices.   The strategy you take seems dictated by the cards you get.  This minor detraction doesn't really take away from a fast easy and fun game that is actually pretty deep.  The game doesn't play like a card game, it plays more like a simplified version of a heavier euro (which it is) because there are several different resources to manage.  The brilliant thing about this game is that the several different resources are all represented by the same cards, just used in different ways.  A clever design.  Most of my 100+ unlogged plays have been online.  Only issue is that sometimes it feels like there is a right way and a wrong way to play the game, and once you figure out the mathematically correct way to do it, you are done.  The game is then decided by luck between players who know how to play well.  Good game.

Follows the theme and some of the fundamental mechanics of its big brother, Puerto Rico, while still managing to stand out as a good game in its own right.

We almost always play with a house rule that the Guild Hall is worth 2 points per *different* production building -- so a maximum of 10 points if you build the sugar, coffee, tobacco, and silver in addition to the original indigo plants.  That puts it in line with the other 6-buildings, which have similar max values.

Rules question:  can you draw a card for the Poor House in the turn that you build it?  The rules explicitly note that you can't draw a card for the Carpenter on the turn that you build it, but there is no explicit note for the Poor House.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Simple and straight-forward, but different strategies are available.  Almost all two-player plays so far -- but these allow a degree of head-to-head competition, mostly through selecting roles (especially one your opponent would prefer to choose).  Some tough choices to make depending on the cards drawn.

While not as gamey as it's bigger sibling Puerto Rico or offer a decision tree as rich as Glory to Rome or Race through the Galaxy, San Juan still stands out on its own. What it does better than the game mentioned above is that it is a much more relaxed endeavour, it is simple, as well as far easier to introduce while still being gamey and have substance.

My only criticism of the game is that the balance heavily swings towards civil (i.e., purple) buildings in the two player game -- this, in turn means that players not in the know or players whose draws don't match the dominant strategy don't stand as strong a chance to make it out on top. However, the game is not terribly long to play -- so this type of bad luck is not damning but rather an invitation to try one's had at it again.

Update: July 4th 2015 -------------------------------------
The expansion buildings address my only criticism of the game (i.e., mono-purple) by making diverse paths not only feasible, but also fun!

On odd mix of Puerto Rico and all the cards that are too powerful in Magic.  Race for the Galaxy and Dominion have diminished my desire to play this these days.

I like to think of it as Puerto Rico "lite."  Less complex, less setup, but a little less fun.  If I had Puerto Rico, I would play that instead.

RATING: 6
I've played almost exclusively as a two-player. Race for the Galaxy, which has more depth and better balance, has lowered my estimation of San Juan. I find the Guild Hall strategy to be pretty much unbeatable. Perhaps better with more players, since finding a Guild Hall card in time is less sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is a really nice game that plays pretty quickly. I like it's ties to Puerto Rico but in reality it's a very different game. Your economy can be driven by more than production buildings and that make it's less painful than a weak plantation economy in Puerto Rico. Pay close attention to what the violet buildings can do for you. They can really keep you in the game.

I do like this game better than Puerto Rico, but it's not fair to compare them.  Really, all they have in common is the art.
Mar.08 And now that Race for the Galaxy is here - which I also like - I have to say I still prefer the simpler and less chaotic San Juan.

Obviously, it's the same basic system as Puerto Rico, only with far less bits and fewer ways to end the game (exactly one, when one player builds 12 buildings).  It feels very odd to use cards both as money, as produced goods, and as buildings to be built, but makes for some tense decisions.  The dearth of cards early in the game makes the prospector much more worthwhile than in Puerto Rico.  All in all, a nice portable version that captures much of the Puerto Rico experience.  Scales well with different player counts, and is a very good game with two players.

Sixth and last gateway game. I decided to get this one instead of Puerto Rico, since so much is made of the scoring system. We played it wrong the first time, but were picking up speed during the second half of our first game. I'm sure the rating will improve with additional gameplay.  

Medium Gateway/Family game.

This is a neat, lighter theming of Puerto Rico.  I like the art on the cards, and the mechanism are fun.  In many aspects, this is a good introduction to Puerto Rico.  I also like its portability.

The game is a little complex for new players. It confuses those who have never seen card games where the cards can have multiple uses.  In this aspect, it is a neat resource management game and not strictly card collection.

RATING: 8
I love it. This game show definitely that it inspired Race for the Galaxy, but is way simplier. Still the card-as-currency principle which I love as it force to manage your hand in two directions.

I'm sure we can re-theme this to be RftG.

Not a bad game really, but I always feel like I am playing a bastardized version of Puerto Rico when this is on the table. Now that Race for the Galaxy is out, I see no reason to play this again.

Hm.  First off, I just prefer board games.  For another, it just seemed monotonous.  Blech.  Not for me.  But much more accessible to non-gamers than it's bigger and better brother.

I must say that this game requires you to build every time the builder comes up, or you will not winn.  There's no way to catch up once someone is one building ahead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pseudo-streamlined version of Puerto Rico, with some unique features guaranteed to confuse newcomers (like me). The role selection is pretty much the same (the chooser gets a "bonus" for picking the role). The buildings are somewhat different, staying with the theme of PR, but with different capabilities. The cards themselves can be used like currency (to buy buildings), or represent goods (which can be turned into cards), or they become buildings. This aspect had me initially befuddled (similar to Glory to Rome), but after a few plays got used to it. The pace is quick, the rules are simple, but the strategy is deep for a card-driven game. Not as intense as Dominion, but a nice change of pace.

Update (05/25/09): Finally won my first game after playing this on-and-off sporadically for nearly a year. Game is compact and portable, enough so that we could whip out a quick game at the airport. Still, getting to know the advantages of specific buildings is key, which means newbies will get destroyed in their first few games. This, coupled with the "card can be a resource, money, or building" mechanic, may not be as accessible as a gateway game for newbies. People familiar with Puerto Rico will fare better.

Take [i]Puerto Rico[/i] and boil off all the fussy crap.  What's left in the bottom of the cauldron is a gooey tar of condensed fun.  Roll the tar out and cut it into rectangles and you have [i]San Juan[/i].

This one wins out over its older brother in three very important areas—it's accessible, portable and short.  In the time it would take you to play a single game of [i]Puerto Rico[/i] (not counting rules explanation (shudder)) you could play three games of this [i]including[/i] an overview of the rules.  [i]San Juan[/i] has the potential to see far more table time than [i]PR[/i].  That make it clearly superior in my book.  Recommended.

Much better than PR as I do not lose 6 hours of my life playing it that i will one day pine for on my deathbed.  Really thought it would work well with 2 players like the Catan cardgame, but it really doesn't.  Still, the ability to play the exact same game as PR without having to shave off 5 o'clock shadow afterwards is nice.

RATING: 7
I know a few people who are not fans of this game, but I really like to play it. It's fairly quick, and a variety of strategies will work...despite what some people say or think. It's about watching what the other players are doing, manipulating the deck, sticking to or abandoning strategies as appropriate, etc. I have seen folks run away with the game using at least 4 different strategies. 

I have come to a decision that SanJuan, while once one of my hot games, has a huge luck element. I consider myself to be a pretty good player, but if you are not getting cards...you are SOL. Therefore I have downgraded the game. I like game s in which I have more control. I will still play it, and probably enjoy it...but it is no longer on my hot list.

And after playing some more, I have raised it again. I just think its playability for me is there.

Another game I've played hundreds of times with the computer version.  This is a very fun game.  It is based on Puerto Rico and is a lite and quick card version of that masterpiece.  The only problem I have with this game is that due to the limited number of Guild Hall cards, it is way too risky to go for a win via the production strategy.  Essentially there is only one sure fire strategy to win and that involves the violet buildings combined with City Hall/Palace/Triumphal Arch.  It then comes down to a lot of luck as far as who gets the right cards at the right time.  But, it's still lots of fun for me, as my hundreds of plays make obvious.

THE NUMBER ONE game of 2007 in our household. San Juan caught my brain like no other game has since the second Heroes of Might and Magic PC game in the late 1990s. What really impressed me about San Juan was how much I enjoyed the game whereas I think that Puerto Rico is way, way over-rated on the 'geek. I know I am in the minority, but PR just does not do it for me. San Juan, however...

I played San Juan more than any other game in my library in 2007. 2-4 players? 45-minute playing time? Strategic gameplay? Sign me up!

The artwork - while simple - is just right. I love the color choices and the look of the buildings throughout the deck. Every week it seems as if we find another path to victory, another way the cards can combine in new and interesting ways.

I typically choose not to play my analog board games on the PC. San Juan was one of my two exceptions (Ticket To Ride being the other... and I like this game better).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It amazes me that San Juan can feel so much like Puerto Rico in spite of the fact that it has an enormous luck factor, whereas Puerto Rico leaves almost nothing to chance.  In spite of the occasional game loss due to poor draws, I still enjoy San Juan.  It plays relatively quickly, has multiple paths you can take to victory, and the addition of luck means that games vary wildly from play to play, so games have a lot of variety to them.  San Juan is cheaper than a lot of other games, and it's incredibly portable - I put my entire set into one of the thicker CCG deck boxes.  In spite of the luck factor I heartily recommend this one.

A Puerto Rico card game that is sufficiently similar to my all-time favourite eurogame is enough to ensure this gets a reasonably high rating from me. Clever use of the same cards as buildings, goods and cash, but the restriction to 4 players is a definite downside, as is the absence of any 'shipping' action which makes the whole experience much more 1 dimensional. For me this has been entirely eclipsed by Race for the Galaxy, but I can see some preferring the simplicity on offer here.

One of my favorites. Plays more quickly than Puerto Rico and I like the randomness of the cards drawing (in addition to how the game uses the same building cards as resources and much more) more than the "perfect information" of it's "big brother". The only flaw of the game, if you wish to call it that, is that it is more a multiplayer solitaire, since the only way to affect your neighbours is to take a role he desires. Still, it's fun to play not-so-confrontational game occasionally since many of our regular games are pretty cut-throat.

Very impressed with the transition from boardgame to cardgame.  Thought it would never work but I was dead wrong.  Very good game.  The only complaint is the chapel, seems a bit broken.

First played this game Oct 23rd, 2006 and again on Oct 24th.  This is a time relief of the Purto Rico game since it is much simplier.  It doesn't take much to set it up and plays more straitforward as well.  On the 2nd game I had realized that there may be a card or two that seems to be a bit overpowering.  If so, then possibly that card can be taken out before play to even things out a bit or present another new card(strategy) that would be supreme.  Update:  This appears to be a totally different great game with two players and seems more balanced.  Perhaps this is because I haven't played it enough with multiple players?

Took us a couple plays to work out all the rules and understand the cards and how they work together, but once we did, the game just zipped by. 
Works great 2-player, involving but not too long and what seems like multiple paths to victory. Like how the cards have more than one use in the game. I think we will be playing this one for a while to come.

Inferior to Puerto Rico and Dominion, but it is different enough that you might want both, especially where fewer cards are more convenient than the several small boards and pieces and cards required for Puerto Rico or the numerous cards required for Dominion. This game is also cheaper than either of those.

Card game based off the board game Puerto Rico. Roles don't accumulate money like they do in Puerto Rico. I prefer this game with 4 players. Although it doesn't scale too bad with 2 or 3 players.

Fun game.  Only played once so can't comment in depth but I enjoyed it as a lighter alternative to Puerto Rico.  Looking forward to future plays and will most likely buy in the near future.

Well, didn't need to buy it because my secret santa 06 got it for me (along with Caylus).  Rogue461 rocks!!!!

RATING: 7
San Juan is an improvement on Puerto Rico as far as I'm concerned.  Still, the game is pretty boring and maybe a bit oversimplified.  There also appears to be a smidgen of luck of the draw as I couldn't get any of the cool buildings other people were throwing down all the time on my first play.  The game isn't bad, just not all that great either.  It appears to be a middle of the road under-achiever.

-But hey, the girlfriend likes it...*grumble grumble*

Update:  This game has grown on me more, but it still feels like there's a lack in variety of strategies...  I can usually only play a couple games of this a week max or it begins to feel way too repetitive and deterministic.

I heard this one was Puerto Rico "lite". I bought it based on that and was not let down. All the stuff that makes PR great is in here. You can't go wrong with this. One of my favorite games.

RATING: 8
Lots of strategies, relatively short but in-depth gameplay. Great game for people new to gaming and for seasoned gamers.

For those of you who know RFTG: yes, it seems a little like a little brother but I think they differ enough to have them both on the shelf. Also, you can use San Juan as an introduction to the flow of RFTG (without the intimidating icons), or as a completely different game for a different crowd.

RATING: 6
To give credit - this is a very good translation of Puerto Rico into a card game format.  However . . .

You know what they say about seeing a movie after you've read the book.  "Puerto Rico" is the book and "San Juan" feels like the movie that left too much out.  For me, the lack of "money" in San Juan made it feel as though something was missing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.4
This really is a neat concept.  The cards serve so many purposes, and the Puerto Rico role selection is as ingenious as ever.  Somehow though, it just feels a bit too dry when you play it.

Mar08: Finally letting go after 5+ games of Race for the Galaxy.  I enjoyed San Juan, but I just liked the speed and variety of Race more.

Dec15: Picked it up again now that it comes with the expansions.  Plan on using it for more family/gamer intro purposes.

Aug17:

It's not RftG, but it's still damn good.  More approachable as well.

RATING: 8
Good for a challenge.  We almost always play 2-player only.  The last time we played it, we took out the Library b/c the game just seemed to be a race to get the Library first.  If one person doesn't get the Library, it seems crippling.  The bonus building that gives 2 points for each production building also seems too strong.  We modified the rules for that to be 2 points for each DIFFERENT production building.  Still with those mods, it's a great game.

Just got this game a few weeks ago and it has eclipsed our play of Settlers, Carcassonne and Bohnanza.  Good fun that is quick and easy to grasp but has many options for how a player is able to win the game.  We probably will buy Puerto Rico because of how much we have likes this.  I play this with my wife, 10 year old and 8 year old daughters and they really like it.

A very solid card game, nice mechanics with the role selection that presents some tricky decisions.  Picking which cards to discard or keep can be game changing and knowing when to choose each role is crucial.  It can get very interesting once you have developed your tableau a bit, and you have some opportunities for combo-making.

Only downer is that it is a bit solitaire-y, the role selection affects your opponent but the game does lack interaction - but only a bit. This is a very minor complaint, this game is great fun.

Wow, had this game for over a year on the shelf, finally got it out and hubby agreed to play.  He was confused at first, but by the second game, he was doing well, and we even went on for a third game.  We have no strategy yet, and I won't cheat  by reading here what I should really do. Surprised it played so quickly, 15-20 mins at most.  I can see it going up or down a point after awhile, we'll see.

Lots and lots of fun. This game is a lot simplier to teach and explain than Puerto Rico but I feel has a lot of the same elements that make the original game a blast. I like being able to play it with two-people.

Puerto Rico is still a fun game and I like the complexity of it and all but when I'm looking for a short, lighter version of it, I'll play this.

More recently I have played this with four and found the game to be even that much more enjoyable! It was simple to teach and after one game everyone caught on to the different buildings and how to play and wanted to try again. They were hooked.

Nicely-themed card game, with the feel of a strategic board game. Like other card games, it plays relatively quickly and features quite a significant element of luck. However, the players' strategies and tactical play are significantly more important than chance in determining the outcome of any game. The more I play San Juan, the more I appreciate how well the mechanisms work together. The luck involved in receiving good scoring cards can, however, still be a little off-putting.
UPDATE: Well, San Juan certainly has a lot of staying power. I'm approaching my twentieth game over the course of almost five years and I'm still happy to play it.

Card game version of Puerto Rico, so naturally I like it.  The simple design of the cards in your hand also doubles as currency, means there are no bad cards in the game as you can use them for other purposes.  Some are played a lot less frequently than others though, and sometimes your strategy is forced for you by cards you get or don't get though.

RATING: 8
The game moves very quick.  The lack of a captain phase does not detract from the feel of Puerto Rico which surprised me.  Better than Settlers the card game because of its portability and its short playing time.  The Guild House (or whatever the card that gives +2 VP for each plantation) is broken.  I'm not a real fan of the artwork.

I have now played this game several times, but ONLY two player.  As a two player game, this game plays very well and provides a number of different tactics/ build decisions.  I haven't yet played it with more than two.  I don;t understand those that attack this game as simply a "weak" "light" version of Puerto Rico.  It is lighter than Puerto Rico.  However,even thought the games share the same designer and theme, the actual mechanics are very different from PR.  While the games share a modified version of the "job" system, the jobs in San Juan are all about card manipulation of some sort.  San Juan is all about the tempo of your building construction and maximizing card values and tactically has nothing in common with PR.    It just seems that many who are negative on this game were expecting "PR: the travel edition" and were upset when they got a different game.

Nice game, but really, this is not 'the real thing' (Puerto Rico).  It's less complex, more random and you get less fun from play.  To certain degree you have to adopt to cards you draw.
Overall, it's a small disappointment for me.  But again - it's a nice game to play though ;-)

EDIT: Oh boy, after playing Race for the Galaxy this seems inferior in every aspect.  I don't have desire to play it when I can play so much deeper and more interesting game than this humble predecessor.

Finally got to play the computer version of this, so far focusing on the 2 player version. Damn AI was hard to beat for the first 5 games! Challenging is good=fun. It is lacking interaction (the game in general as it feels your just playing your own game really)and there is some luck in the draw, however you need both good strategic and tactical play to do well. You do need to pay attention to the other players.
 
Update: After several more plays this feels more like a race now, basically who can build smartest the fastest. Still fun and addictive. Really want to try PR now...

Update: I prefer PR by a big margin over this however I noticed San Juan with 3 players is pretty good and better than with only 2. Something about the card distribution, turn orders, etc just makes it feel more like a game to me over the 2 player which seems more like a race. This is still a good option with any number if you lack time for the real deal (PR).

aka PUERTO RICO KAARTSPEL. Bij Pascal, 29/12/2015. Puerto Rico zonder veel toeters en bellen. Alle gebouwen staan op kaarten die aan de achterkant meteen ook als "geld" met een waarde 1 tellen. Principe van rollen kiezen (met bijhorend privilege) blijft behouden (goudzoeker, productie, bouwmeester, handelaar, soort burgemeester (naam vergeten)). Er zijn productiegebouwen en paarse gebouwen. Wanneer iemand 12 gebouwen heeft gebouwd, is het spel gedaan. Goed spel, dat snel klaarligt. Het originele Puerto Rico blijft echter het summum.

Good card game and there's a great freeware version of the game that you play solitaire. The flaw (IMO) was the lesser value of goods since there is no shipping. What's my incentive to produce a lot of goods unless I have buildings that give bonuses. I enjoy the game but not as much as I originally did.**Update** There's seems to be a few good ways to win, one in particular.  This has really turned me off to the game quite a bit and I no longer want to play to the point that I kind of dread having it on my shelf, I'm afraid someone will ask to play it!  The cards are either very useful as a building or not at all. There are too many cards that I can never imagine wanting to build.  That's a serious flaw.

Hooked me on gaming.  Lots of plays, did not grow stale.   Owned for years.

Played IOS version with Brian. He comes back for the win against two Guild Halls.  He's a good player.  Strong game even in pass and play. 

Decided to make this our final game before sophomore year. Weird game, it was late. Cards not coming out when needed. But we both built the 6 buildings, I has two and we tied. Chapel weighed heavily.  

Now I play solo.  

Played a couple of hands, summer 2017.  Still a favorite.  Comfortable game to close out a night of gaming. I think this one deserves classic status.

RATING: 8
San Juan is considered by many to be an inferior take on a tableau-building, role-selection card game compared to Race for the Galaxy, but I prefer this lighter approach where the focus is more on executing one or more of a limited set of strategies through optimal timing rather than understanding a plethora of possibilities that are not obvious to all but experienced players. As a result, it has a much shorter learning curve. It does sacrifice some depth to achieve this and can sometimes be frustrating in the occasional game where luck of the draw has it in for a particular player, but these flaws are tolerable for a 30-45 minute card game that is, on the whole, an enjoyable experience with just enough depth to make it fun as a filler or a featured game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Plays well with two.  It's fast and easy to teach.  I'm not convinced that there's a wide variety of strategies available, but that doesn't seem to detract from it too much.

I dropped this rating from 8.5 to 5.5, because of Race for the Galaxy.  I just see myself wanting to play Race more often, although San Juan will still be travelling with me to all family gatherings.

If you hate Race for the Galaxy, but want a Puerto Rico Lite then you should check this game out.

I have the iOS version. It has a similar mechanism to [b][thing=28143]Race for the Galaxy[/thing][/b] but it's not nearly as much fun as RftG. "Dull as dishwater" one reviewer said. I agree.

[Edit: Otoh, playing a game solo on an iPad Mini is not nearly the same experience as playing on a table with a live opponent and a pitcher of margaritas. Perhaps my rating is not fair. I'll boost the score from a 5 to a 6 for this reason.]

RATING: 5
Light-weight card game based on Puerto Rico. I am not too impressed with the game. Part of it is probably being spoiled by Puerto Rico, but overall San Juan seemed too simplistic (one-dimensional), repetitive and, well, 'forgiving' compared with PR. However, at the moment I can't see it as a satisfactory "light weight PR" substitute, and with so many other nice light games to choose from, I have difficulty seeing myself playing this a lot. The game does work better with more than two players though.

RATING: 7
A great simplified version of Peurto Rico, and a precursor to Race for the Galaxy.  There is some degree of luck because in the games that I have played the players with bonus buildigns are the ones taht win, and that is aprtially based on luck.

My initial rating for this game was a 7.5, but with a couple of plays, it's just barely hanging on to a 6. Why would I play this game when Glory to Rome, or even Race for the Galaxy? There's so much more fun in Glory to Rome. San Juan might be better if you really love PR (I've never played), but I can't imagine choosing this over GtR.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (July 2013)

An ok game, although too light for my taste. I (obviously) see the resemblance to RFTG, however, I thought they were more similar. I don’t particularly like Puerto Rico, so I don’t expect much from San Juan. The theme is awful (for me) as is the game art, neither inspire me to play the game. At least you have some interesting choices from time to time but I found the game to be (more or less) obvious.

I dislike how you never know for how much you can sell your goods, also it seems there are too few roles.

Bottom line, San Juan is much more easier (and accessible, its only advantage) than RFTG, however for me both games are mutually exclusive so I don’t think I will play San Juan a lot, I will continue to play RFTG, a very superior game in my book.

Current Rating: 5.5

Each player has a hand of cards which are different buildings and which double as money. To build a building you have to discard its cost in cards. Some buildings generate income, others make using your cards more efficient, or are just worth bonus points. Given the cards on the table, players take it in turns to select one of the remaining "roles" which then means [u]everyone[/u] now can build, or generate resources, or sell resources, or whatever the role says.

Only played 2P so far. We like it. I prefer it to its "big brother" Puerto Rico... there's more going on in San Juan yet it moves more quickly.

What a fantastic game!  Can't believe I let this sit on my shelf unplayed for so long.  While comparisons to RFTG aren't without merit this simply appeals to a broader audience.  Simple rules and fast gameplay coupled with replayablity thursts this game into my top ten perhaps even top five games.  

Perhaps I've overplayed Dominion lately but right now I like it better than it.

RATING: 8
Have the original version with the expansion and the new version that adjusted and added a few cards.  My only issue with the old was that a few cards seemed overpowered.  If you drew one, you changed your strategy to maximize that card and you'd likely win.  I'm hoping the new version creates more paths to victory with different strategies and combos.

This game is different enough from PR to be worth playing.  It is largely a stripped down version of it's big brother, but this makes it faster and easier for non-gamers to relate to.  And the choices of what to build, what to save, and what to throw away is a new twist on the typical choices of PR.  

***I've moved this down a bit, since after repeated playing, it seems to be lacking in depth.  The luck of the cards, while somewhat managable, can still have a large impact on the game at times.***

While I prefer it's big brother (Puerto Rico), this is much easier to play with inexperienced groups.  The triple ability of the cards (buildings, money, and goods) is a clever mechanic that works really well.  Plus, the Mrs. likes it so it has a decent chance of being tabled often.

Moved from a 7 to a 6 as I've finally learned to appreciate RftG as being a GREAT game.

a lighter game, especially good for games who are familiar with the themes in puerto rico.  The game is interesting and usually tense.  There is luck, but it moves quick and isn't as  prone to analysis paralysis as it's more complicated cousin.  It's not a game that will warrant it's own game night/session, but to fill some time, it hits the spot.

RATING: 7.5
Great game. I prefer SJ to RfG. Don't see how all those extra icons in RtG give you deeper play rather than just more complexity. I like the tension of never having enough cards in hand to "pay" for what you want and having that sinking feeling as you glance what your opponents are doing! Some of the cards seem too strong though. Biggest defect is that certain strategies are somewhat obvious, game plays itself a bit. 3p seems the sweet spot; for 2p, Glory to Rome better.
Update: As I've played GtR more, SJ of course seems simplistic. But that hasn't eliminated my desire to play.  If anything, SJ is solidified in its place when I want a quick simple game rather than an epic battle.  GtR or RftG or Eminent Domain don't "fire" SJ just because they share the same core mechanism--no more than a Ferrari fires a Corolla.

[thing=166669][/thing]

A card game based on Puerto Rico. The pack of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and violet buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else. Cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round. This new edition of San Juan contains the additional buildings from the previously available expansion but not the event cards. It also contains a new building not previously available in any version: The Hut. This building grants a card when nothing was sold in the trader phase.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Despite its commonalities with Puerto Rico, I don't feel I know this game well enough to rate it after one play.  San Juan brings to the forefront what was perhaps the only aspect of Puerto Rico that I didn't care much for, the myriad special properties and powers of the buildings, while greatly simplifying my favorite part of PR, the process of growing, selling, and shipping crops; it also feels too luck-dependant for a game that is so dependent on planning.  Still, the strength of the role-selection mechanism and the tactical choices offered by discarding some cards to "build" (play) others made for a fun game.  At this point, San Juan is a tentative '7', based more on my enjoyment of my one game than my (lack of) desire to play it again.

We're playing a lot of this at work.  I really like the game, and find that doing the best with the cards you have is the way to go (i.e. making your strategy fit the cards, as opposed to picking a strategy, and finding the cards to fit it).

Very enjoyable 2P as well as 3P and 4P.

Es una version light del Puerto Rico.

Una cosa buena de este juego es que puedes representar cualquier cosa con las cartas: edificios, mercancias, VPs...no necesitas ninguna ficha extra.

Por otro lado, creo que no funciona bien para dos personas, siempre hay suficientes edificios de producción y es muy fácil conseguir cartas..

No es un mal juego, pero prefiero el Puerto Rico. Una buena alternativa a este juego podría ser Race For the Galaxy.

It's a light version of Puerto Rico.

A nice thing of this game is that you can represent everything with the cards: buildings, goods, VPs,... you don't need any extra counter.

In the other hand, I think it doesn't work fine for two people, there are always enough production buildings and it is so easy to get cards.

It's not a bad game, but I prefer Puerto Rico. A good choice for this game could be Race For the Galaxy.[/color]

RATING: 8
This game is a winner.  My 8 rating is cautious and may go up with more plays.  Played with people aged 9 to 61 and everyone has liked it.  The use of cards as money and buildings and commodities is makes this a landmark design.  No DIRECT player interaction, but your decisions are heavily influenced by what the other players are doing - there is LOADS of indirect interaction and you really have to keep an eye on your opponents.  This is no multiplayer solitaire with an auction overlaid as a lame interaction mechanism - there is real player-vs-player tension here.  2 player games a fun and quick but can be scripted (and take out the libraries!) but in 4 player the players really must adapt to what others are doing.  Only complaint is that there are a couple of horribly under-powered buildings - the crane and the archive are bad and the sugar mill is not good either.  Rating raised to 9 after 50-60 games.  Fantastic.
Update:  four player San Juan is probably broken - fourth player really cannot win against competent opponents.  Three player is also difficult for the third player but not as much.  Tough to think of a good fix, however - the alternative starting hand rules are probably not quite a big enough help.

Unlike many gamers, I actually played Race for the Galaxy before I played San Juan. I didn't care for it much. The lapsed CCGer in me wanted to love the rich card combinations, but I found the "discard cards in order to play other cards" mechanic a massive barrier to my brand of strategic enjoyment. I realize that you can play the game in a zen-like state of openness, taking the opportunities as they come, but that's not really my style. Perhaps more importantly, I was turned off by the simultaneous role selection of RftG, because it took much of the focus off of clever card play and put it on inferring your opponents' probable actions, not so you could response in a normal sense, but so you could piggy-back on their roles and get more done.

So, San Juan. It doesn't have simultaneous role selection, which already makes it a markedly better game for me. The combinations available are also much less complicated, which I judge to be a better suited to a game that cycles cards directly into the discard pile before they see the light of play. Thing is, Puerto Rico is such a quick and smoothly flowing game that I can't see why I'd ever play this instead. Glory to Rome, my pick in last month's list, runs circles around this game when it comes to using cards both as buildings and building materials. In the end, San Juan seems merely unnecessary.

My gateway into Eurogames.  Played it to death for a while.  Great mechanics, love the "cards are everything" mechanic and the role-selection mechanic.  But I've played it so much now that I know even if you beat everyone with your "engine", it still boils down to being lucky enough to draw City Hall, Guild Hall, Castle and/or Triumphal Arch w/ all 3 monuments.  That kills the game for me...too few real victory paths.  Rating:6

Update: After one play of the Alea Treasure Chest expansion, I think it fixes the problems I have with the game.  Rating: 8 - and if it stands to repeated plays, it could easily go to 9

RATING: 7
Played this for the first time with my (non-gamer) fiancee ... she thought it was OK but not overly impressed, mainly because of the fiddliness of the phases and having to learn what all the violet cards do before you feel like you understand the game, and the rather dry theme.  She would actually prefer Blue Moon, because reading the distributed rules on the cards is part of the spirit of the game, and earning VPs through building guildhalls and plantations pales in comparison to mutants, dragons and hosing your opponent with a massive fire strike!

(Based on online play, I personally think the quick play and simulation of the Puerto Rico economy through hand size are great concepts.)

At first I thought it was a little silly compared to PR. But my wife loved it so we played it quite a lot. I must admit it grew. This is actually a good card game in its own right, with some of the best features of PR implemented.
The best thing about it is that it plays well with 2 and you can play a game in 15 minutes.

Surprisingly deep. After my first 10 plays (against the computer), I thought luck was the dominant factor. After 700 plays, I'm fascinated that there are still several BSW players that routinely beat me. Not that I think I'm a particularly skilled gamer, but I would have thought 700 plays would have been more than enough to reach the point where luck determines the outcome between similarly experienced players.

The number of players changes the game significantly, but it's excellent at all counts. It might take the nominal 45 minutes in your first 4-player game, but with a table of experienced players it becomes a meaty filler, 20 minutes max.

A simply beautiful little card game.  I actually enjoy playing it more than Puerto Rico.  It has zero setup.  The mechanics of play is also brilliant.  Using the cards as currency, goods, and buildings is just so seamless.  Such a great game.  I wish I'd thought of it!!

RATING: 7.5
Was aware of the game, but it wasn't really on my list... until I picked it up brand new at a moving sale for $13! Hoping that it becomes one of those great (and cheap!) surprises for us.
--
After a TERRIBLE first attempt at trying to learn/teach the game, that ended 4 turns in (more due to the state of mind/health of the players than the game), we finally got around to playing again and I think it was safe to say that all involved loved it. The mechanics, honestly, do take a little time to wrap your head around - but once you get it, it's a lot of fun.

What's more, I'm hoping that the positive response to San Juan leads to more games of Puerto Rico and (fingers crossed) Race for the Galaxy. Whether or not that actually happens, I think we'll still be playing San Juan for a while to come.

This game is a great way to get familiar with the different buildings from Puerto Rico. I like PR, but this has the edge because it breaks up the overwhelming learning curve into digestible chunks. You only need to focus on YOUR hand. My wife picked it up quick without having played PR before. A great ap. Clean and well designed. My only criticism is that the background is a boring table. Maybe this was a result of cards clashing with more busy backgrounds, but I didn't feel as immersed in the theme as I did with the original PR.

Puerto Rico lite without the brainlock or the slavery issue (at least not front-and-center). Just enough variety in buildings to keep you thinking and keep multiple strategies viable.

A good game that scales well.  Most of my plays have been against computer AI, which accounts for my low number of total plays.  Perhaps the ultra-fast computer has spoiled me, because I've found that players who don't know the cards well (and literally have to read them to judge whether or not a card is worth building) can make the game drag.

Puerto Rico was a total bomb in our house.  Did not play well with two and was not something that interested our son, the third potential player.  So it quickly left the house.

Rating will probably rise with more play, if my Geek Buddies are any indication.  I expected this to be a 2-player replacement for Puerto Rico, which it doesn't completely do.  This, of course, is probably an unfair expectation.  A lot of the tension I like in Puerto Rico was absent here, though I feel that increased play, and maybe a 3 player game or two would really put this in a better light.

Update: I do enjoy this more with 3, and I like how quickly it plays.  However, with only 3 players, why not play Puerto Rico instead?  Our 3-player games generally only take 30 - 40 minutes anyway.

San Juan es un juego de cartas sencillo, parecido al CatÃ¡n de Cartas (el cual es sÃ³lo para dos), aunque mÃ¡s sencillo que este y con menos estrategia. Se trata de un juego rÃ¡pido (media hora aproximadamente, quizÃ¡s algo mÃ¡s), que de momento estÃ¡ en inglÃ©s (y la dependencia de idioma es alta).

No he jugado nunca al Puerto rico (su hermano mayor), pero el San Juan estÃ¡ bien, sin mÃ¡s. Entretenido para una partida rÃ¡pida sin comerse mucho el coco. Poca interacciÃ³n entre los jugadores.

I've enjoyed the Java version of this card game for a while now. The game plays quite well in person and is an excellent quick fix for that Puerto Rico urge. As usual with card games you can lay the blame of loss on a poor card draw so this really does hold it back. The speed of the game means alot of this luck can be ignored as you can always just pick up, shuffle and play again. A good fun game. A little too involved to be considered a filler. Scales pretty well.
As with Puerto Rico, it suffers from having no mechanics to aggravate the runaway leader.

There is a little bit too much luck in this game for my liking and some overpowered cards (e.g. getting library early can be very strong with 2 or 3 players and an early Guild Hall in hand pretty much locks you into a rather boring strategy). It is still playable though - just not a favourite.

A much lighter version of Puerto Rico. Captures many of the same elements but is different enough to not feel exactly like the same game. Plays quick (under an hour) once you get familiar with everything. Very fun. Plays well with two players, but much better with more. The only knock against the game I have is the trading. If no one else is utilizing the producer/trader rolls, you'll have a tough time pulling it off by yourself. On the other hand, if everyone is utilizing those rolls and you haven't had a chance to get any production buildings down, you'll be left out and possibly hindered. Worth having in your collection for sure! My rating is for 3+ players. It's an 8 for a 2 player game.

I love this game. It is well balanced and versatile with 2, 3 or 4 players. My wife and I always enjoy this as a 2-player in the quiet of the evening after the kids are down. I introduced it to my neighbor in a 3-player game (also with my wife) and he immediately declared it his favorite game. (I have since taught him Puerto Rico and now he won't play SJ anymore.) My wife and I like that you can just plop down and start playing San Juan (and it plays much quicker with fewer choices to make each turn). We also played this with another couple on our street as a 4-player. They caught on very quickly and her husband ended up winning the game! It was close up to the last round when he got a 6 violet down that pushed him ahead of me. It's just a great game, easy enough to learn, with lots of ways to go after the win.

Based on 10+ plays.  It's quick and enjoyable enough.  For some reason, though, it doesn't really click with me.  Perhaps it's the combos, or the sense that once a player falls behind in the building race, he's out of luck.  Regardless, it's one of those games that I ought to like more than I do.

My Wife and I played this the other night and we both really liked it.  The score was really close.  You definitely get that same Puerto Rico feeling but with out all of the tedious and time consuming set up and put away.  It is a fantastic little card game that provides one with many strategic and tactical options.  I love it.

I love the versatility of San Juan. Building cards and factory cards are also money. So it's impossible to draw a "bad card" -- if you don't like it, you can spend it. Interactive by default because all players take the action selected by the current player. Fun, satisfying little game.

RATING: 9
Requires perseverance. About to give up on it when I thought the series of combos I shot for each time was unbeatable, until I got thoroughly trounced by seemingly a nothing strategy. Endless visits back to the drawing board to discover new combos have kept it very engaging. Kind of worried about trying Puerto Rico now as I wonder if this is more streamlined and elegant.

Update.  I like Race for the Galaxy more, and with this going for fairly high prices, I sold it.

The game moves fast and has many similar 
decisions to Puerto Rico.  There's lots for each player to do.  The luck of the cards plays a role since you need the 6 point violet buildings if you want a chance to win.  For that reason, hand management is a key point to this game.I think this will probably go up when I play it more and learn the distinctive advantages of each of the buildings.Updated July 2006.  It's now in my "the more I play it, the more I want to play it" set of games.  Rank is climbing with each play.

Based on two plays; both four-player games.  This is a fun game in the vein of Glory to Rome or Race for the Galaxy however this game is simpler/easier.  I wonder, however, if this game would get tiresome after many repeated plays.  On the other hand, it's a good intro to this type of game and a good stepping stone to learning Glory to Rome.  In the overall scheme, I prefer Glory to Rome, then this game followed by RftG.

This one just rolled over Jambo.  I'm not sure about what I'd say between this and Race for the Galaxy, since a lot of folks seem to really love that game.  I'll have to play San Juan a bit more to solidify my preferences. 

*Update*  I definitely prefer this over Race for the Galaxy.  For 3 or more gamers, I prefer Glory to Rome, but for 2 players or with non-gamers, San Juan is great.

*Update 2*  The game is elegant to the extreme, but really fails to light my fire.  I just find it okay.  It's on my stack of games to get rid of before the move.  I always want to play Glory to Rome before this game.  I may even prefer Innovation to this game, need to give it another try.

A nice game, and makes for a good intro for novice gamers to the slightly more complex Puerto Rico.  I think it's superior to the Settlers of Catan card game in that it plays well with more than two players, four being ideal.     If a game must be restricted to using cards, this is probably our favorite.  That makes it a good choice for travel/portability concerns.

If Puerto Rico is the finest steak dinner at a four-star restaurant, then San Juan is a hot mouthwatering hamburger cooked just the way you like it.  You can't really compare the two, but sometimes that burger is just exactly what you want.  Great game, and fast.

Puerto Rico's lighter cousin. Acquired in 2005. Total number of plays = 26. I definitely prefer Puerto Rico over San Juan but when you have 30-40 minutes and 2-3 players, San Juan gives you the flavour of Puerto Rico in a quick, short, satisfying game. It's also much easier to teach and hardly takes any setup time. Hasn't gotten more than one play per year since Race for the Galaxy came out.

A decent game to introduce to a "non-gamer" group that's ready to advance a step or two in game complexity. It's simple enough to get the hang of, plays fairly quickly, and does not suffer from serious down-time for players. My only wish is that the cards were a bit sturdier, and that the game came with scoring chips rather than pad and paper - the Java version displays scores for players progressively through the game, so you can make decisions based on the score rather than a guesstimate.

Full of strategy, but they can get used up after a while and players can take advantage of not trying new things too easily.
Some cards seem useless and there are perfect strategies that are hard to pull off which makes this game really good. Not as difficult at puerto rico, and funner in my opinion. Though, too bad its only for 4 players max, hence the 6 willingness.

One of the few games wherein I am able to get my feeble intellect wrapped around various strategies. Sadly, my preferred strategy appears to be "Draw the card I want", and I execute it poorly. But this game is always fun, although I prefer it for 2. I'm afraid my wife and I have progressed little beyond the Guild Hall as our default strategy, but that has started to change. I believe this was our most-played game last year, and I expect it to see a lot of time on our floor (we play on the floor, not at a table) this as well, with perhaps less Guild Hall wishfulness.

San Juan is a great resource management card game. If you are looking for something similar to Puerto Rico, go somewhere else, as they don't have anything in common, aside the license.

In opposite to Puerto Rico, San Juan is a very tactical game, so the brain burning of the first is substituted by the simple yet agonizing decisions that need to be taken each turn. As a card game, luck makes an impact, but isn't dramatic.

Interaction in San Juan is low and and completely indirect. From time to time players will be able to affect their opponents with certain moves, but nothing too drastic. Things like not picking a role which would benefit them or holding buildings which would benefit them most.

This one and Race for the Galaxy are frequently compared, and not without reason: they play very similar. I'm more fond of race, though. Mainly because the interaction in Race, despite being even more indirect, is more frequent and meaningful than in San Juan. It's way easier to understand the depths of San Juan than those of Race, so it's usually better to start off with this one.

San Juan is a fun tactical card game. And scales surprisingly well too! While you do need to adapt your playingstyle, it can be played with any number of players. I do prefer it with two or three though, due to the greater degree of control.

Puerto Rico, in a card game format. Not nearly as good as PR, but fun all the same. Sometimes, space requires a card game, quick and easy clean up.

At Gencon, I picked up a copy for $10.  I wanted to give it another go.  Since last year I have played Race for the Galaxy.  And that game is very similar and I would say San Juan is an easier version of it.  This game is really fun and it forces you to make a lot of decisions fast.  And the fact that the game can be played within an hour is a real bonus to me.  Can't wait to play it again.

Puerto Rico light? Sort of. But there's very little player interaction, and the buildings available in your hand are more or less random. Some strategy is involved, but this game completely lacks the charm and the payoff of a good strategy that Puerto Rico offers.

It's fairly simple to teach, but very interesting to play. It's actually more complicated than most of the gateways (Ticket to Ride, Carcassone, and Settlers of Catan are all simpler to learn), but still quite teachable, especially since the cards are quite explicit about what they do. So I think it fits a good niche.  

A lot of people say that RftG is just flat out better (and more complicated).  I also prefer RftG, but I'll need more plays of San Juan to decide whether it's relative simplicity is being mistaken for being less deep.

Not a huge fan of the game because I find it a bit too simple.  Bought for the sole purpose of prepping people for RftG. Also own the expansion.

This card game captures some of the feel of the original Puerto Rico, but it injects much more chance through the draw of the cards.  The game is certainly much faster to start, and it's pretty easy to explain.

The use of cards to represent multiple resources adds some appreciated depth to the choices, which otherwise don't seem as heartbreaking to make.  Repeated plays still suggest some imbalances.

[Original] This card game is a must have in all game collections. Although based on the widely acclaimed Puerto Rico, it is its own game. The similarity between it and its progenitor is obvious in that: (a) there are roles to choose from each turn (in this case 5 roles: Builder, Councillor, Producer, Prospector, and Trader), (b) many of the building perform similar functions, and (c) the game ends when a player builds his/her twelfth building. However, the differences are equally obvious in that: (1) the game is much shorter (due to faster play), (2) there a new buildings that the original Puerto Rico does not have, and (3) the strategies are very different. [Note: Some buildings from San Juan do appear in the 2004 expansion for Puerto Rico.] Finally, it is important to note that this game is best when played more than once. Being familiar with the different cards ("buildings") is necessary for improved play. Give the game a try, but please play it more than once before rating it here on BGG--you'll be glad that you did. Have fun building your own version of old San Juan... I always do!

[2008.Mar.29] Still a very good game, but now that I have played Race for the Galaxy a handful of times San Juan suffers minor bump (downwards) in my ratings.

Think Race for the Galaxy themed around PuertoRico.  The fact that all buildings are available to be built at all times means that new players must read, understand and remember every cards before even playing, which make it a bit less attractive to me.

This game is really interesting. Many people will prefer more complex games like race for the galaxy and glory to Rome, but I find these games way too complex.

It's a decent variation to Puerto Rico on card game format.  SJ is essentially PR-on-training-wheels with card-drawing randomness.  It's better to use the variant enclosed with the rules.  I usually reshuffle the unwanted ones back in the start deck so that the game begins with NO discard pile.  Not a bad light card game using the PR theme.

Update 3/23/2011 - Came back to this after a long hiatus.  It feels quite dated compared to its younger sibling Race for the Galaxy.  I'd play RftG over this one in a heartbeat and I lowered the rating to a 5.  
============================
Certainly plays faster than its bigger sibling Puerto Rico...:-)  Ingenious use of cards to serve as buildings, produce, and money for constructing buildings.  I think I'd still rather play the boardgame though.  The library seems to be hugely unbalancing in a two player game.

Két játékos esetén nem olyan jó, mint több játékos esetén lehet. És szerintem túl sok helyet igényel az asztalon, mire tizenx kártyát minden játékos lerak maga elé. A szerepválasztás kiváló, a kártyával fizetés is, de valahogy nem az igazi. Szerintem jobb lett volna, ha minden játékos kap egy táblát is, amin logikusan, a játék áttekintését segítően lehet elhelyezni a kártyákat, de az már túl közel lett volna a Puerto Ricohoz, és a játék dobozméret igényét is megnövelné.

Excellent card game that simulates its parent game well for situations when playing a full game of Puerto Rico is not possible.

San Juan condenses the Puerto Rico experience, taking PR's coolest feature (the buildings) and making them the main show.  It also cuts out a lot of the procedural junk that made some of PR feel like work to me -- planting the corn fields, drafting the colonists.

Unfortunately, though, it also cuts out the major zero-sum aspects of PR -- the trading house and crowded ships.  That's a shame, because if Seyfarth had ported those over to this game I think it could have been great.  As it is, it's merely "pretty good."

It ends up reminding me less of PR and more of "Citadels".  And I think it compares poorly with Citadels -- they're both building races, but in Citadels you can directly affect your opponent:  assasinate him so he loses his turn, steal his gold, take his cards, blow up his buildings.  There's nothing at all like that in this game.

In "San Juan", it's mainly a contest of timing.  Choose to build when your opponent is low on cards... choose to produce when his production houses are already full, stuff like that.  It's not bad, and sometimes I like a low-conflict gaming experience like that.  The CCG-like interactions with the building are fun to explore and discover.  It's clear that there a few different strategies available for winning here, but equally clear that the ceiling for these possibilities is rather low.

The cleverest thing about this game is the "cards as everything" approach... I'd like to see that imported into another game because it makes everything run so cleanly and intuitively.  I'll have a fair amount of fun with this game, but it's clear that burn-out can't be all that far off.

Sometimes I play it solo on computer as an engaging time waster and other times I play it with friends as a meaty filler. It's a satisfyingly quick approximation of Puerto Rico and a good gaming experience in its own right.

San Juan + Expansion (adds 1 of each type) production buildings:
11 Indigo
9 Sugar
9 Coffee
9 Tobacco
9 Silver

2nd Editions changes:
Bank cost decreased from 4 to 3.
Prefecture cost increased from 3 to 4.
Gold mine now adds the lowest cost card instead of any card.
Guild hall reduced from 2 points per production building to 1 point per building and now also provides 1 point for each different type of production building.
Newly added Hut: "In the trader phase, the owner of a hut draws one card from the supply if no good was sold by any player during this phase."
One less Sugar mill included (8 total).
Includes new buildings plus 1 of each type of production building from expansion set but not event cards.
Improved iconography and art.

Thoughts on 2nd edition: The artwork on the second edition looks great. It's a shame the new Hut card is a bit of a disappointment. While the Event cards in the expansion can be fun, they won't be missed in this edition. Increasing the Prefecture was a good call. I understand the reason for the change to the Gold Mine, but it would have been better to receive one of the cards at random instead of the lowest value one every time. The change to the Guild Hall seems reasonable to prevent scoring lots of points for multiple cheap production buildings.

This is just a temporary rating, I find this game amusing, reminds me of my MTG days in some way, the problem is I can't find why, maybe is the randomness and that you need to constantly change your plan accordingly to the cards you draw. It's just amazing, I need to play it more, It's addictive somehow...

Edit: WOW... just WOW... I showed it to one of my cousins and he was as amuzed as I was, on how much the game was about "trying to screw your opponent while searching for a benefit for yourself", this game owns a 10 (but from the lack of playing I still give it a 9), it's just amazing how I just played it 2 times and they were like playing two different, engaging, complex though simple, strategic games...

EDIT: I know now why I gave it a 9... Race for the Galaxy makes this game obsolete if not garbage...

[gameid=28143]-lite.

An okay game that uses the same character selection as Puerto Rico. The theme is pretty thin and the strategy is fairly basic. Decide which "6 building"  you are going for, then build cards that work with with/for that building.

This echoes the comments of others (I forgot who) that state San Juan takes away the multiple paths to victory that Puerto Rico has. Race for the Galaxy solves the issue by having victory point chips, which allows for multiple paths to victory.

Very enjoyable as a two person game; have not played it with more. Portable, so it travels easily with my wife and me. I was concerned that the theme wouldn't do anything for my wife and that it would be too "busy" for her given that she really likes the elegant simplicity of Lost Cities, but she surprised me and really took to this game.  I think this is her new favorite and is currently mine among the two person games that she most likes to play (i.e., this, Battle Line and Lost Cities).

[GAMEID=8217] actually feels like more than just a card game.  There is a sense of actually building your colony and you can see your new buildings spread out in front of you.  Each building gives you special abilities, so there is a lot of potential for making efficient card combinations, so it was right up our alley.  The mechanism of using cards to do everything from buildings, money, and trade goods is unique, but facilitates rapid card turnover.  As a result, you get to go through quite a few cards, so the luck doesn't seem as dominant as you can go through the deck quickly.  Since the goods used unseen cards, it also prevented card counting, something neither of us was too interested in.  In order to be a good player, you have to tailor your game to the cards that you [i]do[/i] get---and it's quite balanced where you can go with a production/Guild Hall route or a violet building/City Hall route or even a mix of the two and stay competitive.  

The game also works quite well with two players.  With two, it's a little easier to get the role that you need, so the game is more of a race/efficiency game.  With more players, there is more chance to use the roles as a denial to other players, so the game does feel different with different numbers of players, which I think is a good thing.  Although, since each player gets to perform the action, there feels like less of a runaway leader problem as well.  

Sadly we also downloaded one of the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/19840]San Juan PC versions[/url] here and ended up overdosing on it.  It became our essential "Solitaire" game to play on the computer whenever we had free time.  As a result, it somewhat soured us on face to face play, especially since we were used to the much faster computer version.  [GAMEID=8217] is a game that definitely feels like it deserves an expansion to spice it up.

Update:  We ended up getting [GAMEID=28143] in a trade and we love it!  See above for more details.  Sadly in the end, [GAMEID=28143] has completely replaced [GAMEID=8217] for us.  Although, I think that it would have been much more intimidating to learn without having played [GAMEID=8217] first.

After many a 15-20 games of this, I am only now just starting to win every once in a while. Kirk established a sound strategy early on involving building hundreds (okay, more like ten) production buildings, and acquiring a library ASAP to maximize his turns. 

That said, there are many paths to victory in this game, which makes replayability pretty good. 

Libraries, in our opinion, are so amazingly beneficial that if both players don't acquire them around the same time, the game quickly becomes unbalanced. We usually remove the Libraries from the deck before play now. We also change a couple of the cards - Guild Hall, for example, only adds a single point for each production building (rather than the original two points). Otherwise it's almost a certainty that whoever gets hold of a Guild Hall (always Kirk, somehow) will win the game. At 1 point per production building, it seems a little more balanced.

I feel like this one is slightly more hyped than I would expect, but I do like playing it a lot.

Played only on BSW.  A decent card game, but too many of the decisions seem pretty obvious.  I'm not saying that there is no skill involved in the game - there's actually a fair amount - but the game just doesn't engage me.  Good for an occasional play, though.

UPDATE: Bumping this up to a 7, ironically just as I am about to get its sibling, Race for the Galaxy. I've now played SJ a fair bit on BSW, and it has grown on me a little. My biggest issue with San Juan is that all of the scoring methods depend on having a powerful card-drawing engine. This makes every play feel very similar, even if I am pursuing a different strategy. SJ needs another element to broaden its strategic landscape. I think RftG may offer this "fix", which would be a real blow to my rating for San Juan.

Fun game, the luck-based Puerto Rico. Needs some rules tweaks for 2 player, where it shines for us (no Library, etc). Since it's quick, the random hosing from bad card draw luck isn't so painful, but it brings the rating down for me.

[2006-03-07] Reduced rtg from 6.5 to 6.0, due to hosing from the random card draw - 4 player game, 6 times through the deck, and I never saw a Single Six Point Card the whole game! Scores: 18 [me], 28, 32, 38. Blech.

3 players is the perfect number for this game.

[2007-03-22] Cautiously raising rating from 5 to 6. Played some 2-player recently, with NO RULES CHANGES, and so far it has played well. This time. I still worry that the random factor will kick in and kill the game again at some point. I stand by my comments on the 3-player (good) and 4-player (sucks) game still.

[2011-03] Have been having a renaissance with this lately. Fun fun. Just the right length, just enough of an engine going on, and each game has been different. Added in the expansion which works well. Upped rating from 6 to 7.

Puerto Rico simplified.  I have played a number of times and there really are only a very small handful of strategies that work with the game.  Most strategies that 'look' good can be easily overcome without any effort.  If I feel like playing this game again I will probably instead just pick up Puerto Rico.  That said the cardstock is quite good and when I play it I do feel like I have options and choices available to me, even if they arn't all as viable as I'd like.

Really good game that shares similarities with Puerto Rico but that is a completely different game. 

Gameplay is simple if you already have played Puerto. Games are quick, each games is different depending on player number and on the cards you draw. 

There is luck in the game but it can be mitigated by good play. I really like that cards are money and building. It makes each decision really difficult : do I build this big thing and LOSE almost all my hand or do I build this small production for few buck... 

All in all a good game that is also cheap to buy, portable and that is equally good with 2 to 4 players.

Puerto Rico in card form with a couple of twists. Scales well, but plays best with 4.

Since I haven't played Porto Rico, but did play Race for the Galaxy before, I'll just compare it to the latter.
RftG is more complex (therefore harder to learn), but it is a better game.
San Juan is still a nice game with hard choices, but not too hard, so it can be good as an introduction game. 

It is also slower than RftG and you can actually make your productions work for you much easier...

Good quick version on Puerto rico, doens't have the depth of the original game though, and it looses its luster if you play it too much, many of the choices become obvious with repeated play, and sometimes your strategy can be determined by the cards you get (especially in the early game)

A tableau building game similar to Race for the Galaxy but with a Puerto Rico theme.  It is effectively Puerto Rico, the card game.  I found the game to be a lot of fun and very strategic.  You have to determine what simple buildings you put out to complement your production buildings.  You take roles like Puerto Rico as well that grant small advantages.  I found the game to be great card game that is more accessible than Race for the Galaxy.  A good "next step" game for new players.

Shares some mechanics and theme with Puerto Rico, but is a great game in its own right - not just "PR light".  

This is a nice game for something light to play (a filler), or if you want to teach a non-gamer something fairly easy.  Much better with more players.

If you want to play something like SJ, but would like more depth, scalability, and re-playability, see Glory To Rome....a far superior game, but a game that might be too heavy for many.  Race for the Galaxy is also an "upgraded" version of SJ, as it is similar, but adds more depth of play.  Specifically, it makes production more viable as a strategy when playing 2 or 3p as you can directly generate VP's instead of just more cards.

2 players it seems production is an inferior strategy.  I rate it a 6 with two players (still OK), but much better to play with three or four when I would rate it an 7.

This game is a blast. There is enough luck involved to balance my wife's playing with my more strategic approach. The way cards are used for money, goods, and property is very clever, although it is very frustrating to have to give up desirable building cards when you need "money." Overall, we have found ourselves playing this a lot. We bought San Juan because of the compact size (it travels with us in the camper van).

It also has the best box layout (plastic insert) of [u]any[/u] game that I own (well Rum & Pirates comes close, but this is perfection): a place for the cards and the trading tiles, the scorepad and even a special spot for the pencil.

Most of the new expansion cards (from Treasure Chest) are quite good [i]as long as there are a large number of players[/i]. In a 2- or 3-player game, they throw the balance off too much.
I actually like the game better without the expansion cards.

Despite the fact that I don't like card games in general, this game is really neat. It is important to play it a few times before you judge it. Once you know approximately which cards are in the deck, the game starts to become interesting. Plays very quick and has enough depth to give it a high re-playability score. I personally prefer this game over its mother, the board game Puerto Rico, simply because you can start playing almost immediately (no setup) and it is slightly more simple. Plays wonderfully with 2 players.

Love this game.  Take everything I like about Puerto Rico, leave behind everything I don't like, add a touch of luck to make it a bit casual, and you get San Juan.  Also, it gives you the same feel as St. Petersburg, but significantly reduces how fiddly it is by combining the money with the cards.

This is one of those games that you don't have to win to take a lot of satisfaction in how you did, the decisions you made etc. to make your little "empire" come together.

Fantastic card game version of Puerto Rico. I absolutely love this game. I only have the first edition without the expansion so I have only been playing the old basic game. But there is still enough there for me to keep playing it and playing it year after year.

Having said that I think I am about ready to try the expansion buildings and events out. Its just a shame I have to buy the second edition of the whole game to get them.

On your turn you choose a role and perform that action, everyone else then gets to perform that action but not in the extra special way you performed it ... because you are special, so special. You produce / trade / build your buildings and the first to 12 buildings built ends the game (like Roll for the Galaxy, they are all of the same distant related gaming family a bit like a Star Wars plot) . Some give you in game powers, some end game points. I am sure if you are reading this you know how it works. It just works fantastically. Highly recommended to play with gamers of all ages. All of my kids love this.

Keeper. Thinking about getting the second edition just to get the expansion cards.

Nice card game version of Puerto Rico.  Simpler and quicker than the board game version.  Can be a good dose of luck involved.

The more I play, the less interesting it becomes.  I haven't had the same problem with Puerto Rico (but I haven't played it nearly as much, either).  My problem with SJ is that for 2 players, producing goods isn't really a viable strategy: You NEED to go the City Hall + Prefecture + Quarry route.  With 3, and particularly 4, you can produce goods and still win, so it becomes interesting again (with 3, it can go either way--goods might not really be much of a factor, so again, not that many interesting decisions to make).

The expansion cards are excellent.  They make the deck bigger, so you're not as likely to be able to play your favorite strategy every single time.  They add new life into Trading with 2 or 3 players (with the Customs House), but also maintain a great deck balance.  The Cathedral (which isn't dealt into the deck) is similarly helpful; if you're the unlucky player to never draw the 6 buildings, you can build the Cathedral and capitalize on other players' 6 buildings!  I have nothing bad to say about the new buildings!

Event cards are great, too.  Well-balanced, and give you some interesting options for roles.  The only downside is that the option of event cards can make the Trade/Production strategy less likely even in a 4-player game, since you've often got an event card option.

Kudos to the SJ expansion!  It made my rating for SJ go up quite a bit.

This is the excellent light version of Puerto Rico!

I also love the fact that the same cards are being used in four ways: as buildings (from your hand to the table), as money (from your hand to the discard pile; to pay for the buildings), as goods (from the draw pile (face down) to a production building), and as victory points (from your hand to the chapel).

The game also plays very well with two!

Edit: After having played 'Race for the Galaxy' a lot, I lowered my rating from 9 to 8 for this game. I'm afraid that 'Race for the Galaxy' took its place...

San Juan est un jeu de cartes reprenant le thème et certains mécanismes du jeu de plateau Puerto Rico.

Successivement marchand, bourgmestre, chercheur d'or, architecte ou artisan, les joueurs vont développer leur cité de San Juan et accumuler le plus de points de prestige!

RATING: 8
Interesante juego de cartas, con un olorcillo a Puerto Rico, pero con una mecánica bastante diferente.
Aquí las cartas en la mano hacen las veces de moneda, edificios, fábricas, barriles producidos, etc. Debido a eso, es necesario tomar dífíciles decisiones de qué cartas usar para pagar y a qué producción y edificio violeta privilegiar.

I played the heck out of Puerto Rico when it first came out, then gave it a rest for a long time - long enough that for a while I actually deluded myself into thinking I liked SJ better.  A recent play of PR demonstrated otherwise, but I still like San Juan a lot.

Good preparatory game for Race for the Galaxy also.

Card-based lite version of Puerto Rico.

Good game, with lots of variable strategies depending on which cards you draw.  But after playing it lots, and becoming familiar with the cards, I lost the "joy of discovery" and have not played much since.

RATING: 6
I revised my rating drastically for this game due to another playing.  While some of my earlier concerns are still valid, I actually enjoy the game.  I still think the cards still look too much alike and could have used nicer graphics.  It is much simpler than Race, but not as flavorful, so I rate it a step below.  A clever, solid game design.

RATING: 7
Much simpler than "Puerto Rico" or "Race for the Galaxy" but enough going on to make it fun and interesting.

RATING: 8
I don't know why, but I keep winning this game.  I don't find it as much as a brain-burner as I do "Puerto Rico", but I also feel (as I do with PR) that I don't consciously "get it", either.  That said, I keep winning in the group I play with.  That probably has something to do with my rating of 8, but I also find this far lighter than PR and so am more likely to be willing to play it than PR.

I'm amazed how much of Puerto Rico this game packs into a card game -- while remaining different enough that neither one replaces the other in my mind. I love being able to use the cards three different ways, and the fact that everything is discarded face-down -- it's just a clever game.

I like it for a lot of the same reasons that I like Puerto Rico, but it fills a different niche because it's shorter and easier to teach.

One of the most innovative designs made using just cards.  The system just works. Scalability is also excellent.

RATING: 8
Fun, intruiging and addictive game that is painless to set up and play. What freaks me out is most of the "card xxx is overpowered" or "xxx strategy is unbeatable" talk. Most of the people just haven't played enough or only with inexperienced players. Besides, imbalances so glaringly obvious that they can be spotted by playing twice would never have passed Stefan Brück; this is an Alea game, after all.

The one quibble I have with the game is  its tendency to resemble a tactical puzzle, and I really don't like that trend in current german games.

Playing RftG has even enhanced my appreciation for this game.

After a couple of plays both 2 player and 4 players, I say this game doesn't tickle me the right way. Maybe I should try Puerto Rico before I declare the switching role mechanism to be the itch.

It takes the best of PR and adds in a strong element of luck so that your strategy is reactive as opposed to fairly stagnant as PR can sometimes get after many plays. I enjoy seeing my plans evolve over the course of a game.

I originally played this on IOS. It's SO MUCH better in person, without AI players. I think that's true for most games, but considering how much this game rose in my esteem after playing it in person, I would have to say that this game might be (because of the governor action) one of the most important to play with others around a table. I really like it. San Juan has a lot of depth for such a simple rule set. I'm a half dozen plays in now, and I feel like I've barely scratched the surface. It's also interesting how different it plays at various player counts. The game has a classic feel. I could see it having a lot of staying power. I'm certainly not bored yet, just interested in exploiting new strategies. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Just played my first game. Played with two players. Overlooked the rule that states that when playing with two players that the Governor takes two roles. We played by taking one role each per round. This slowed the game down a bit but was still enjoyable. Would play again.

RATING: 7.68
Pro: A solid one mechanic role based gateway card game. One of the first games a gamer can show their non-gamer friends to see what kind of games they like and to show them certain mechanics and how to build "an engine." The mechanics work very well as they are used in other even more popular yet deeper games. Games between equally experienced gamers should be rather competitive. Cheap and travels well.

This game was somewhat written off as trade bait and put to the side. A year later and it keeps sticking around. This is holding up to plays better than some other games. Its greatest crime might be that it isn't Glory to Rome. Some might consider that a good thing.

Rating Potential: 7. I'm not sure it ever gets in the 8 range, but this is really a solid game that holds up so far. I've increased its rating after I bottomed it out. Still a solid gateway into the role selection mechanic but merely playing Glory to Rome showed me there is better out there. How constrained the game is makes for a great gateway, but it leaves it lacking once you are beyond that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fantastic "lighter" version of the boardgame that has the flavor of the boardgame for those who have played it but not the "scary" aspect of the seemingly weighty rules that non-gamers perceive.

Plays 2-4 card game. Hand management, card advantage and building efficiency are keys to winning this game. There are basically 2 strategies: purple buildings and Guild Hall. 

Buildings have different values depending on number of players. Library is brutal in 2-p games, less so in 4-p games. 

Fun! Game captures the Puerto Rico feel.

Played 15-20 times. Scales well, but I think it´s more interesting with 4. A very friendly game, in that you can always use your cards for _something_, and that players can only hinder each other indirectly. No setting fire to buildings or stealing cards in this game. Very little downtime as well.

Very interesting. Much like St. Petersburg in the two player version. Sort of a dueling solitaire game. I think this has a higher weighting than StP.

I prefer Puerto Rico, but this is a fun little card game.  Plays quickly and fairly strategic, although bad draws can kill your chances of winning.

UPDATE:  Lowered my rating from an 8 to a 6.  After more games, I've come to realize that there are certain overly powerful buildings.  If you draw one it's easy to win unless the other players are actively trying to shaft you.  There are some other strategies, but they require the right cards at just the right time, so they aren't as easy to pull off.

Like Puerto-rico lite! This game has similar feel of puerto rico, but has: 2 player rules; quicker rules explanation; fewer parts to lose; quicker set-up; takes less time to play; drawing cards reduces "weak-player syndrome" (BIG problem with PR); and is much more portable. My wife and I have played PR several times and enjoyed it, but we were the weak players and our competitors stomped us... and they took FOREVER in doing it (approx. 2 hours). We played San Juan with same group and the games were much closer, and we even won several times. We introduce this game to our non-gamer friends (those who still think Monopoly is a boardgame...tsk!) and they all enjoy it! Highly recommended!!!

Rare one of the card games whose random card draw does not bother me. It's partly mitigated by the councillor action (draw a few, keep 1), partly canceled out by use of bum cards as building material. Brilliantly streamlined version of Puerto Rico, providing a much better grasp for role selection.

Android app implementation is superb.

04/15/04 Obtained. I usually prefer it to Puerto Rico, its board game predecessor. Why? It takes half the time, doesn't require messing with 300 tiny wooden bits and small tiles, doesn't take as long to explain (less complex), yet gives 2/3 the flavor of Puerto Rico. As of 11/22/17 I've played 77 times.

Played once. Didn't like it. Maybe that's because I had no idea what was going on and everyone else was experienced. To be fair, I'm a much bigger fan of board games than card games, so it's not without the realms of possibility that I'll never get to like this one.

[Edit:] I have much improved my opinion of this. It's still not a favourite, but it's a decent little card game. Oddly, it's playing RftG that's given me more of an appreciation of what San Juan can offer.

[Edit 2:] This is a really nice little game that has really grown on me. Just like the person you once thought you hated but somehow ended up having quite an intense relationship with, this game has really surprised me. I will never now turn down a chance to play this.

After Race for the Galaxy got out, this has rarely been played. It's still a great game and wonderfully balanced. Edit 2012-10: with the Alea Treasure Chest's San Juan expansion the RftG-San Juan -situation has been reversed - nowadays we usually rather play San Juan, not RftG.

Very fun game with a somewhat open ended feel.  I felt that my strategy largely depends on what cards I get early in the game or else heavily betting on future cards.  But that didn't really detract from my enjoyment.  Now it feels smoother than that.  I especially like it with the expansion.  Bumped up from an 8 to a 9 after a dozen plays.

New in collection jan. 08 Bought from Lajos.
If you're in for Puerto Rico, but don't want the setup-time, this is an "almost there" alternative.

For me this game is totally obsolete after 2 years: it doesn't come close to the experience of Puerto Rico (the boardgame), and after I played Race for the Galaxy I never played this again.

Now I've found Glory to Rome which is way better than Race for the Galaxy, so where does it leave this?

Only reason for keeping this is I might take this along to holidays, bars etc. because I wouldn't want to take my rare Glory to Rome along. Oh, and it would do a nice job of being the gateway to this "multiple use of cards" kinda game.

I really, really wanted to like this game.  The reviews and strategy guides on the Geek speak so highly of it and its simple, yet strategy-deep gameplay.  But it just gets boring every time I play it; I don't even care who won by the end.  Perhaps it's too short to make me really feel like I can influence my position rather than being at the mercy of the cards, but there are just so many better games that could be played instead...like the real Puerto Rico.  Now that I've found Race for the Galaxy, I have absolutely no reason to give this game a second chance; Race is a much, much better game.

As someone who is generally wary of card-combo economic-engine type games, I was favourably impressed with San Juan.  This is perhaps because the number of options isn't as overwhelming as in some other games that have a similar feel.

Although it's not a game I'm always actively looking forward to playing, I am quite happy to play it.

After two 2 player and three 3 player games we have found the game to be quick, smooth and addictive with nothing vindictive about it.  It is light to carry about and lightning fast to set up and explain to newbies.  It is going to make it harder to let other good games see the light of day much.  Firm favourite already.

This has been a favorite for my wife and I, and everyone we've played it with has enjoyed it.  The first few plays will be a little slow while players get familiar with the buildings and develop a strategy, but not to the point of being overly frustrating (unlike its cousin, Race for the Galaxy, whose icon system is a notable hurdle for brand new players).

I was intrigued by the concept of using cards as money as well as the things to buy with the money. ie, spending your buildings to build buildings etc.
There seem to be only a few viable strategies in this game and that really takes away a lot of the fun for me.

I like Puerto Rico, but it's not my favorite.  I bought San Juan mostly because it was rated so high, but frankly hadn't gotten it on the table because I figured it was going to be as "thick" as Puerto Rico.  Now, after a bunch of plays, I have to admit that I was very wrong.  It has many of the brilliant aspects of PR, but it's much more streamlined and fast.  It's quite easy to explain the rules and start right in.  In fact, I think I prefer SJ because of the ease of play.  This is a really good card game that feels like a full-on boardgame.

I like this game. It's varied enough and fun whether you have 2, 3 or 4. The short time makes it perfect for lunch. I see myself playing this at lunch quite a bit.

Update: I downgraded from 7 to 6. It's still a good game, but I generally only play it with 2, which kinda has a runaway leader problem. It seems that by turn 4 the leader is determined. Still good though.

Update: back up to a seven. Breaking free from group think and playing it like RFTG, I enjoy this much more now.

RATING: 8
Game in a Nutshell: Card game of building a city. Choose roles to decide how to do so: Build, trade, produce, or draw.

Played as: 2,3 player

Pros: Not too hard to learn, but many things to explore when the game gets going. Really simplifies the role selection mechanic in a way the streamlines things and keeps the game moving. Scales well for any number of players. A great alternative for people who find Puerto Rico too long and too open.

Cons: At two players (or more as far as that goes) it probably lacks the optimal amount of player interaction for a face to face game (but is entertaining none the less, and others might enjoy it for this same reason). Might play slow at first while players have to read through exactly what they have in their hands. Currently, I'm fighting the idea that there's a few cards that can be a little strong when built early in the game.

Other: I played this after the similarly mechanized Race for the Galaxy and found this by far and away the easier to start out on. Definitely the way to go for people that think Puerto Rico is too complicated, takes long, and requires too much work.

Best Use: A step up from your simpler, super-fast, filler card games.

Excellent game. Some similarities to Puerto Rico, but significantly different to warrant purchase.

Main advantage over Puerto Rico is the removal of 'fiddly bits' (colonists, goods etc). Also, San Juan has a greater 'luck of the draw' component - making it more accessible for new players and more dynamic in gameplay (ie. each game is different based on the cards you get).

Great way to introduce new gamers to some of the Puerto Rico mechanics (role selection, governor, trading etc) as well as a great game in its own right.

Recommended.

Great card game version of Puerto Rico. In fact, I'd dare say that I like San Juan more than PR. It plays quickly, is easy to grasp, and is 100% non-confrontational. I think the only thing that holds it back is that because every building has its own specific rules, it can become difficult to remember who affects what when you start to have more than a handful on the table.

Good, mostly engaging card game with though decisions on every turn. Gotta love that cards in hand=money mechanic. One more role would have greatly increased replayability. As such the game sometimes feels 'scripted'.

[u]08-Feb-2013[/u]:  This is the card game based on the full board game of Puerto Rico.  It uses a similar mechanism of role section, with the person choosing the role getting a bonus, to play cards into your personal tableau.  This represents the town of San Juan and all of the buildings you have constructed.  Some are production buildings so you can make goods and sell them.  Others offer additional actions, bonuses, or VP based on the role chosen.  The cards represent everything in this game - buildings, money, and goods.

It's a fantastic, lighter card game with that Euro boardgame feel.  If you've tried Race for the Galaxy and either didn't "get it" or can't find an opponent, you should give this a try.  I think it's more accessible to the family gamer, and offers plenty of strategy and tactics for all to enjoy.  Plus, I think the SoloPlay variant is great for anyone interested in a solitaire version of this one.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]:  This has become a solitaire staple in my collection over the past year.  Sure I like the multiplayer game, but my family hasn't really been that into it.  Bummer.  As I think it's a really solid Euro card game and would recommend to most gamers.

As a solo game using the SoloPlay rules, I have a ton of fun with it.  I really like how the additional rules and building powers mesh together to make an enjoyable and challenging point-attack style solo game experience.  I was never really a Patience/Klondike solitaire gamer.  But if I were, this would easily replace that as it plays just a quickly but offers so much more in terms of decisions and ways to score VP.  Love it.

They did a good job of porting Puerto Rico gameplay into a card game.

I also like that the cards themselves are used as THE commodity.

All plays with expansion

*Dec 2013* After 5 plays with 2-3p, I think this game is an excellent strategy filler. It plays in 30+ minutes, setup is virtually nonexistent (other than shuffling the huge deck of cards), the amount of buildings within are not overwhelming, even with expansion, and the 12 building limit forces you to choose which buildings to go for. There is some luck but going with it and not fighting it will help you proceed to victory. 

Rating reflects it as compared to all games for what it does, pros and cons. As a thinking-man's filler, I'd probably boost it up a point to 8.5. Rating could go down if replayability is limited. 

Perfect for lunch hour gaming at work. 

*Nov 2015* Raised from a 7.5 to an 8. Again, my rating includes the expansion

Tight card-based adaptation of Puerto Rico.  Definitely simpler than Race for the Galaxy -- would recommend Race for more gamer-oriented folks, but San Juan is a perfect recommendation for less gamer-centric players (and potentially a sneaky way to get someone into Puerto Rico!).

RATING: 8
San Juan is great, and the more I play *other* two player games, the more I appreciate this one. The multiple uses of cards makes the game much more strategic and less luck-driven, and I find that the frequencies of the different cards in the deck are right on (at least as a 2er). Plenty of paths to victory, although I am especially fond of Smithy and Guild Hall.

The only way in which San Juan comes up short is that there could be a bit more direct confrontation, compared to something like Euphrates & Tigris card game. But compares favorably to building games like Starship Catan.

...oh, and then Race for the Galaxy came out.

This would get a much higher rating if there wasn't Race for the Galaxy. The only reason to play this is if the other players are not up to learning the iconography of RftG. Without RftG this is a really cool game, but the limitations become apparent by the comparison.

An enjoyable mix of strategy and luck, this game is a good introduction to (the much more complex) Puerto Rico.  This is a card game in which the primary activity is building buildings (each of which is a card) that produce goods; however, the unit of currency used to pay for the buildings is the cards themselves.  This leads to interesting strategic decisions, as you must discard (spend) building cards in order to build other buildings.

I enjoyed the light-hearted interaction between players that the role selection created.  The game pace picks up very quickly as the players stuggle to keep up with the leader.  Luck-of-the-draw can lead to a runaway leader, which limits this game to a long, but pleasant, filler for me.

A classic game of building a city from other buildings....using cards.  Hand management is critical for success as well as a balance between diversification (well, I benefit all the time, no matter what is going on) and hyper-specialization (I always Prospect, cuz I am THE Prospector).  I only have a couple of gripes with it: 1.)  getting a good combo is 50/50 luck/knowledge so new players will never get it while experienced ones will get junk sometimes.  Knowing the big-point cards is important. 2.) A lot of the time it's easy to see fairly early that you are falling behind, which can be demotivating to players.

Overall however, it is a fun, fairly light, easy to travel with game with a refreshing setting and surprisingly aggressive playing.

RATING: 7.5
Kártyagyáras verzió (Anno XVIII), ami már tartalmazza a kiegészítőjét is (The New Buildings & The Events).

A játék egyértelműen a Race for the Galaxy öregapja (szerencsére jóval kevesebb ikonnal), és a Puerto Rico kisöccse. Ha már ilyen képzavarral élünk, akkor a 7 Wondersnek meg a nagybátyja, a Citadellának pedig az unokatestvére (vagy valami olyasmi, elég nagy a család, nehéz így). :o)

Nagyon jó a mechanizmusa, minden kártya háromféleképpen használható fel: épületként (ha megépítjük), pénzként (ha fizetünk vele egy épületért) és áruért (amit eladhatunk később újabb kártyákért).

Rövid, pörgős, egyszerű játékmenet, a játékszabályok szinte 1-2 perc alatt felfoghatók. A szerepválasztás is kiváló.

Egyetlen bajom vele, hogy kevés a konfrontáció a játékosok között, inkább pasziánsz jellegű az egész. Igaz, a kiegészítőjében szereplő eseménykártyák már konfrontatívak, de ezt még lehetett volna csiszolni.

Szóló módra is van kiváló játékszabály, azt is érdemes kipróbálni.

Nice game, pretty easy to learn, not too long.

I'm getting a feeling of diminishing returns with this game. Maybe it's because I'm a former Magic player this doesn't seem to be holding my interest as well as I'd expected.

I've seen someone suggest removing the library card, at least for 2p games. Might have to try this.

Traded for Quoridor in a Math Trade. $10 to ship San Juan. What a slap in the balls.

Very good game! Lighter and more luck-heavy than Puerto Rico, but still offers very nasty decisions and a tough card economy to manage. A blast as 10-minute filler in BrettSpielWelt and really good with the real cards, too.

My rating has flip-flopped around a bit. 9 is good. 

The expansion cards from the Alea Treasure Chest is very good. I would never play without them, fortunately the new edition includes them.

Enthusiastic.

RATING: 7.5
Nice easy card game with enough depth to be engaging without melting your brain. Plenty of tough choices to make with a nice blend of tactics and strategy. Though there are multiple routes to victory, it's tough to know when to play the cards you're dealt and when to gamble and wait for something special.

Coming to [i]San Juan[/I] for the first time after hundreds and hundreds of games of [i]Race for the Galaxy[/I], it seems very plain and too easy by comparison. Still, it's a good design, and the expansion spices things up some. [5 plays; sold Jan'14]

Good game.  Card-based game derived from Puerto Rico.  Great two-player game that will play up to 4 players.  I almost always have this in my bag.  Because 1) it's a good game and 2) it works well as a 2 player game, so it covers that niche in case I and only one other person need a game to play, but it also is a great game for 3 or 4.  I find the multiple uses of the cards as buildings, money and products to be elegant and satisfying.

Interesting game in which the cards in your hand count both for playing and 'money' for the cards you want to play (improved by Race for the galaxy from the same designer). It seems a little bit bland for my taste, because at the end it all ends up drawing and building the most expensive cards.

Camping?

This one is a classic and with good reason to be... it's a very very cleaver game... I always love the mechanics where I have a hand with awesome cards that I want to play them all but I have to choose which ones I will play because the others will be the payment.

Like this only as a 4 player. All the possible options of the cards work much better and the produce and trade kind of falls apart with less than 4 making there much less winning strategies.

First, do NOT compare this game with Puerto Rico. It has different mechanics, different strategies,...
The game itself is good. It has two interesting mechanics : you need to use cards as money, forcing you sometimes to discard cards you wanted to use, and the role selection, giving you extra priviliges.

RATING: 5
feels a lot like a 'not as cool' version of race for the galaxy to me -- it seems like the rounds took longer because you always had to wait to pick your role; and new options would appear after the previous players picked their roles. i think the simultaneous selection of race might make it have less waiting time.

I get how this is simpler than Puerto Rico, and how it's about managing the odds, but there's just too much randomness involved for me. I'd rather my long-term strategy weren't entirely dependent on the cards I draw. There are a number of viable strategies, but if you don't get an appropriate points-multiplying violet building, it seems like you're kind of out of luck. I doubt I'll play this again.

Puerto Rico-lite? Yes, sorta . . . It is hard to imagine taking the currently #1 ranked and simplifying it into a card game, but that is exactly what they did.  Please note that this is NOT a Puerto Rico expansion or dependant upon the original in any respect (including knowledge of the rules).  This is its own game.  It plays "similar" to PR, but is distinctly different (e.g., cards are buildings, goods and currency)and definitely faster.  As San Juan took an abstract game (PR) and made it even more abstract, please stay clear if you do not like euros.  Just how good is Puerto Rico?  Well, it is ranked #1 and San Juan (its offspring) is currently at #38.  How many games (game-systems) can boast two games in the Top 40?  Award(s):  Hall of Games (Austria).

Despite being a port of the Puerto Rico system to a card game it displays the Puerto Rico look and feel very well. The best thing is that it is simpler (and more accessible for newbies) and easier to set up without losing most of the depth of play that Puerto Rico has. It also plays well as a 2-player game, whereas Puerto Rico does not. I'd give this another 1-2 marks if the outcome weren't so heavily influenced by the card draw in the first two rounds of the game.Updated: Played one game with the significant other. She thought it was OK but not great. This game is OK as a light alternative to Puerto Rico, but I'd prefer to play Puerto Rico.

RATING: 7
This game is similar to Citadels, but is less cut-throat.  Unfortunately this makes it a little bland, although it's ideal for players who take games too personally.

This game takes a while to teach because there are so many different buildings so everyone needs to read all the cards during the many 'get cards/discard cards' phases.

It feels like solitaire to me in that it passes the time, with little pleasure in the actual process.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Bought this thinking that it would be a great alternative to Puerto Rico for non-gamers since there are no pieces to set up. Unfortunately the rules are just as complex to explain to non-gamers. And for me, half the fun of playing Puerto Rico are the little pieces, so this game is half as fun.

Neat mechanics, agonizing decisions, endless planning (before the game! - and then of course destroyed by the card draw) make this a great game.

As remarked in some thread the value of the buildings change depending on the number of players which is unfortunately not reflected in their cost. With this modification I'd give it a 9.

It feels like a CCG but doesn't cost as much.

A simpler and, dare I say, more boring alternative to Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy. Easily my least favorite of the three, though probably the easiest for new players to pick up. I enjoy playing it every once in awhile, but I wouldn't play it over its brethren if given the choice.

I've so far only played this as a 2 player game and I like it quite a lot. A good blend of strategy, tactics and luck. At this point I'm not sure how good the replayability will be in the long term as there are optimal strategies based on what cards and combinations you manage to draw. At this early stage though I am not bored with the game play and still have some exploration of strategies to pursue. I can see how some would rather want to play the deeper Puerto Rico... and I can also see how some would say this suffers from the same optimization analysis problems and dryness of PR with the caveat of even more luck thrown in. I think my personal rating of SJ has an almost equal chance of dropping or rising which means this may never become a top tier game for me... but rather a solid and nicely scalable game for 2-4 that has the further advantage of playing fairly quickly which helps mitigate the bad luck of being hosed by the cards from time to time.

This is one of the first games I got in my collection.  It is a lot of fun, but in my opinion, if you get a combination of 2 cards, it makes you nigh impossible to beat.

I view this as a lighter version of Glory To Rome and Race For The Galaxy.  It inhabits a similar niche, but has enough that is different to warrant a place in the collection, notching up plays when the other two games just seem a little too heavy, especially the monstrous combinations of Rome.  I find San Juan a little dry at times, but enjoy it, although I suspect that I would always rather play one of the other two, given time.

RATING: 6.5
A solid game, similar to Puerto Rico. An exercise in efficiency, and unlike Puerto Rico, hand management is also key here. 

EDITED - After playing Race for the Galaxy, I have the feeling that this is outclassed entirely. It would be a solid 7.5 if Race doesn't exist.

Upgrading slightly after further play...well designed game...esp. fun if you know Puerto Rico but not nearly as good of a game...even non-gamers can play and enjoy from my experience...the downside is the luck of the draw and whether or not you get the right bonus buildings at the right time really determines how you do, but the choices you must make are difficult and really do matter as it has that classic good game element of not being to able to do everything you want to do

RATING: 5
San Juan is a very clever adaptation of Puerto Rico, and it does a good job of capturing the feel of the original game while providing a play experience that is decidedly different. I really like the card usage mechanic, which allows every card to be used either as a building (the info on its face) or as a resource.  This really emphasizes the hand management aspects, and makes for a rewarding tactical experience.

I have only played the game with 2 players, and while it works with two, we quickly found that producing goods was a far inferior action to building something or drawing new cards.  This meant that our two-player games became nothing more than an attempt to draw the highest scoring "big" building cards.  It got to the point where we removed the library, because the first player to play it would win.  I imagine the game is better with more than two people, so I'm waiting on changing the rating until I have played with more than two.  As a two player game, it is fine, and it has the feel of Puerto Rico, but it's not great.  Good, but not great.

I've had this one around for years... judging by the layer of dust, it's been perched on the very top of the "unplayed, should try soon" stack for most of that time... I've read the rules, tried the solitaire variant... and always just put it back. No reason.

And then suddenly, with all my other games to choose from, a two-player game of San Juan - and BAM! The darned thing is just as good as the people on the Geek have been telling me! Cripes! I have a lot of catching up to do, to make up for the years I've lost...

My current favourite. What an idiot I've been.

RATING: 7.5
Overall comment: the card game of Puerto Rico which plays a little like the board game but really is a game unto itself. It plays quick and has many light decisions to make. The game is good for new players.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor): 7 (card game with alot of tans and blacks)
Family: 7 (wife does not like it, kids request it)
Game group: N/A (has not been played)
AP: 10 (there is no slow down in this game)
Solo play: 10 (#1 solo - I am addicted to the SoloPlay game and this has caused the rating to go up - 7 without the solo play.  Many paths to victory and the pressure on using the roles properly)

Purchased: 2006
Luck factor (1-10high): 5 (cards are earned but you have to decide which ones to keep and how to use them)
Recommend expansions: N/A
Age range: 8+

Reason purchased: liked Puerto Rico, Geek analysis, looking for a way to get family interested in the Puerto Rico mechanics

Pros: the game plays quick and you can affect the other player a little bit. Once you know how to use the buildings you can see how they can affect your chances.  SoloPlay saves the game and creates my enthusiasm for it.
Cons: the regular game is a little dull after a number of plays. There is not much to look at and the regular game plays the same everytime.

Recommendation: This is a card game with a board game mentality so card players do struggle a little with the choices. You can play this game in about 40 minutes and it a satisfying game. Seek out the SoloPlay game to bring out the fun factor.
Replay rating: regular moderate (SoloPlay High)
Game value(plays/game cost ratio): Very high - once again SoloPlay but above average for the normal play.

A resource management game that is very quick to learn and that scales well to two or more players.  I like the nice balance between building (12 buildings ends the game) and the need for production (buildings cost cards that are replenished via production).  Finally, the flow of a turn strikes me as very engaging.  There is no sitting back and watching the other player make moves for 5 - 10 minutes, and a turn is split into three sub-phases that involve each player.  Might go up in rating with more plays.

Similar mechanics to Puerto Rico, but played competely with cards. It finishes quickly in under an hour, it is a well thought out game with all the buildings and is a good follow up to the orgiginal. There is a luck factor in drawing the right cards (guild hall, city hall) to win. This game always leaves me wanting to play another hand. There are various strategies to consider, such as the guild hall strategy, but this could be be beaten by a pure purple strategy and city hall, but you need to get the right cards. With 2 players, remove the libraries from the game, as I have seen the designer say somewhere they are quite powerful in a 2 player game. Also in a 2 player game, it is almost possible to try any strategy since you will likely get a chance at any card in the deck.

Excitement of playing PR card game faded rather quickly. Played 33 times and no desire to play it again. There are 2 fundamental problems about SJ.

1. No dilemma about choosing roles as there are no coins on it. Same roles are chosen again and again...
2. Too many diffent cards with variety of usefulness. Unlike PR, buildings are not available to anyone. Thus it has quite a huge luck of draw.

It maybe suitable to play SJ if everyone already knows PR and wants to play something light with the seemingly similar flavor. Otherewise there are tons of better games in the same weight.

San Juan is the antithesis of St Petersburg, the former is a board game that looks like a card game, the latter a board game that masks as a board game. It works fine (a good two player game), but it's too short for any serious strategies. I'm not completely sold on this game, as the game feels like breaking an egg and trying to hold the white and the yolk in your hand, often it ends too soon, not in a positive way.*update* My rating is going down. There is just too much randomness in the draws, and the game is too short to rectify these drawbacks with the infusion of strategy (and this comes from someone who sees a strategical element in Both Schotten Totten and Category 5)

First of all, do not expect this to be Puerto Rico in card format.  There are many more differences than there are similarities.  

I do like this game, but I just wished that they would have pasted on a better theme.  Puerto Rico can get away with a dry theme because the game play is fantastic.  

I do like how accessible San Juan is.  As busy as I am I like playing games that are quick to set-up, play in under 90 minutes, and makes you make thought provoking choices.  San Juan certainly accomplishes this.

Hmmmm . . . after several games, I'm still not sure what I think of this game.  I think it's an interesting adaptation of PR, but or course, it lacks much of the strategy and tactics.

This is a great game for those who like to build things, as that's really all you do - collect cards and build.

There seem to be many possible strategies in this game, but some (i.e. jack rabbit, or violet builder, or producer with black market and crane) seem to be the only really viable options.  There is a little to learn about cards that work well with others, but once a player picks a strategy, the choices become somewhat obvious.

I think my ambivalence (please look this word up in the dictionary if you think it's a negative comment :-) comes from the feel that there might be more to this game, but there doesn't seem to be.

A good variation might be some way to see future cards that you might access every three rounds or so.  This might force players to "plan" more.  A building excluding other options or some other way to create scarcity in the game might also generate a need to plan, and plan correctly, from the start.

If I just give up and approach this game as a light building game, then I am usually satisfied with its play.

One of my first euros, and so I may have a favorable bias that makes me like this title and dislike Race for the Galaxy. There is a bit of luck involved -- you want to draw as many of a certain set of bonusing cards at the right time, mid- to late- game -- but by the same token you can make your luck by building an engine that lets you do so. There are multiple ways to build such an engine, and thus multiple winning tactics, although there may only be one winning strategy (to build an economic production engine and then bonusing buildings). It is a card game, plays kind of like a conventional card game, but I'd rather play it than even my favorite conventional card games (Oh Hell, Pinochle, etc).

I bought this game and then played an electronic version a bajillion times (thanks Jim and BGG).  I understand and agree somewhat with the multiplayer solitaire description.  However,    I tend to think that choosing roles to hinder opponents can be quite effective.  I was a little disappointed to lose to a newbie twice in a row, and I was trying!  That keeps my rating lower.  Having played Race for the Galaxy, I do not see myself ever playing this one again.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not want to play this all the time; I've played this a lot on the computer and am ready to see a different game.
-> I prefer direct confrontation a little more.
-> I prefer RftG's theme and depth much more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Better than Puerto Rico, not as good as Race for the Galaxy. You need to make the same sort of decisions as in Puerto Rico (production vs building), but the cards mean that you're forced to be flexible, and making a slightly sub-optimal strategy is less likely to hurt you. On the other hand, the cards don't work to together in ways even approaching the complexity of RftG, which to a veteran of that game is kind of disappointing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent game, even with only two players. The dependence on luck is the only thing that I don't like, which bumped the score down a bit for me. Also I really enjoy 3-4 players as well. Although the dynamics with three players are quite different than two player, it's still very rewarding.

A card game version of Puerto Rico. It preserves the general feel of PR, particularly the role selection intricacies and theme, and in a shorter package to boot.

However, it is considerably more one-dimensional. The lack of shipping is noticeable, and it is much harder to block opponents from trades.

All in all, while still a good game, I think I'd prefer either PR or Race for the Galaxy in any situation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The card version of Puerto Rico is quite similar to the standard version, but it seems like you get screwed over a little less. You can't be blocked from selling, so that helps a great deal. I think one of the best things to get is something that garners you more cards or reduces building costs. Getting high value buildings out early may not be so great, since you really want some purple special buildings.

RATING: 9
(I also own expansion from "Alea/Rio Grande Chest")

First I thought making game simpler and adding element of luck into Puerto Rico would make game worse. San Juan shows it's not the case. Works well with 2-4 players.

Update (5.1.2007): I'm starting to like San Juan more and more. Rating adjusted from 8 to 9.

Although Race for the Galaxy has a bit more of everything compared to San Juan I still like SJ better. Cards are more varied in RftG but they are a bit (too) complex and it's quite easy to forget an icon or two while playing. Especially for a new (or old who haven't played in a while) player. Only thing I absolutely like more in RftG is the phase selection as then every round doesn't necessarely have everything. In San Juan with 4 players there is no such surprise element what comes to role selection. Therefore I like the game best with 2 or 3 players. Might try a home rule someday with RftG-style role selection (probably needs a small tuning with some roles).

This nice card game takes 45 minutes to play, which is really neat. One has to take chances and make though decisions. There is some luck involved in this game but it does not dominate good game play. Plays well with 2 to 4 players. Art work is not bad but could be better. Cards are a bit thin to my taste.

I can't work out why, but there's something much smoother and more disciplined about this than the sprawling Race For The Galaxy. Perhaps it's the reduced choice of cards or the fact that the design holds no enigma. Perhaps it's a less swift turnover and a feeling you've more control over your hand. It's not totally perfect and could be accused of lacking depth after a couple of plays, but otherwise it's a beautifully-scaled little game.

I like San Juan, but have been spoiled by Puerto Rico.  I feel that SJ is a good game if we don't have the space to play (or carry) PR, or if I want to introduce a (non-gamer) friend to PR without incurring analysis-paralysis in him/her.

San Juan is my favorite Euro.  This simple, quick-playing game has seen more playings in our home than all other Euros put together.

Components are very nice.  Rules are simple and clear.  The game system is very good.  You are only supposed to play this with 2-4, but we play this with 5 all the time and the game system is so robust that it can handle it with no problem.  Playability and enjoyment are extremely high.  Realism?  Well, it's a Euro.

Get it.  Play it.  Enjoy it.

Fun easy light filler of a game.  Luck plays a part but better strategy wins over.  Though some potent combos seems to break the game.

Card game based on the Puerto Rico board game.  It has clever mechanics that make it fun to play, although my favourite card game is MTG.  But strategies are limited and the game becomes repetetive.  Bought it when PR was my favourite game.  Used to be my game of choice for two players.  Now my two player game of choice is [i]Carcassonne[/i].

Disclaimer: Only tried it 2 player.

Fast playing card-game, more strategy to it than initially meets the eye. Puerto Rico light, but that only good.

Girlfriend's favourite game cos she beats me all the time. Current standings are 1-5 (my only win at the beginning when I first taught her the game.

Then again, been playing only 2-player games so it might be different with more.

RATING: 7.2
This is a great card game for 2-players! It is a nice filler, but a bit meatier than most filler types! I really like the building and resource management! You don't always have the time for Puerto Rico or similar style games; so this offers a shorter, more strategic game in less time! This game is now seeing most of its plays as a solitaire game...with the rules variant posted here on BGG!

RATING: 7.5
If this game existed by itself, I would probably rate it a nine.  But we learned Puerto Rico first (I rate PR a 10) and I can't help comparing them in my head while playing.  This fairly deep game can seem a little shallow when compared with Puerto Rico and seems easier to always pick one strategy and go with it.  That said, the multiple uses of the cards is genius and the game is fast and portable.  My wife likes this better than Puerto Rico because it's much faster.

Edit:  I played only two or three games on BSW, but they helped open my eyes to new strategies.  They spread among my little group and increased our fun level.  This is getting a deserved 9 now.

Edit: Luck factor among evenly skilled players has moved this back down to an 8 and then a 7.5.  Great game, but a palace really can make all the difference. Plus, it just doesn't have the variety of my most favorite games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an awesome game.  Sure it gets a few plays because it's portable, fast to play, fast to setup, fun, scales well from 2-4...wait what was I trying to say here?

My mom even likes this game!  It can be played aggressively, but still in a way where people have fun.  You can play terribly and still be at least a little satisfied with your city. :)

After playing well over 50 games I can find criticism in the big buildings overshadowing the rest of your city- you really need find and build at least some of them, but that's part of the game.  This is NOT multiplayer solitaire.  Watching and annoying others is key to success.

The only thing that could make this better would be an expansion that allowed another couple players and added some further variety (especially to the 6 cost buildings).

One of my favorites.  Check it out.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Very nice card game take on Puerto Rico.  Some of the buildings are a bit erratic in terms of cost/benefit ratio, but there are lots of simple tweaks out there to fix.  For example, the Guild Hall should always be powered down...

Ok, but you need to already know the deck and all the card abilities to play it well, which I don't. Some of the roles are much better than others, and this isn't immediately obvious. Clever mechanics.

Not as good as Race for the Galaxy. After playing Race, coming back to this it feels very 1 dimensional. All the time I'm thinking how I'd rather be playing Race.

50+ plays. A brilliant adaption of the Puerto Rico system to a card playing environment. The game is all about finding combinations of cards that work well together, securing you a source of income (to buy further cards) and allowing you to get VP's more cheaply. The mechanic of cards being either a building or money, but not both, is fundamental to the constant tension the game produces. Each turn you're faced with the dilemma of looking for better cards, or which card in the hand do you wish to convert into a building, but can you afford to give up the other potential buildings in your hand and use them as money. The game has been somewhat superceded by Race For The Galaxy which uses a similar system but has been made "bigger" in complexity, but the simplicity of SJ still ensures it has a place in the rotation.

Great game! We bought this game as a chance warmup to understanding Puerto Rico because we were new to role selection and variable phase order mechanisms.

A keeper. Though many consider this Puerto Rico Lite, my wife and I believe it stands out on its own. It does have many similarities, but the feel of the game is different enough, and the play time is cut in half.

Great card game! Plays well with  2-4.

The artwork and bland color choices needs a redo. I might consider the 2nd Edition.

"A genius design of a card game. It captured the essence of Puerto Rico, while eliminating the annoying parts (difficulty of selling; being forced to ship). I much prefer SJ over the bloated Race for the Galaxy. However, as much as I respect SJ, I don't enjoy leaching games that much, so I don't love SJ."

What I like:
- Amazing and ground-breaking mechanisms
- Multiple paths to victory
- Quick; simple rules

What I don't like:
- Has more leaching than I prefer
- I wish it had RftG-like icons to show which role activates the card
- The 2p variant (1.5 roles per round) is merely OK

I think the weight of 2.3 is reasonable. There is complexity with the building special abilities, and confusion with the multiple uses of cards. But overall it's on the lighter/simpler side, so accessible to people who have already mastered a gateway game.

Traded it away (for a small grail game)...now I want it back.

プエルトリコの簡易版として扱われるのはあまりに勿体無い。
カードを種類分けする必要が無く、金・生産物・建築物・手札といった区分けをカードの使い方だけで表現しているのが凄い。
プエルトリコシステムで、他者へ得させまいとする絡みが生じる。
ルールは割と簡単で、勝ち筋は複数。
カードの質が良く、スリーブ要らず

コスト6カードの得点計算が若干面倒
スコアカードと鉛筆は不要なので、その分省スペースでもっと安価にして欲しかった（決して高価では無いけど）
鉱脈の4枚コスト違いが自己申告制なのが残念。オープンして確認させるルールだと駄目だったのかな？

Discovered using the crane can really pay off.  Surprised how that worked so well (I was behind in building).  I'm liking this game more and more.

Coming back to it 2011- This is an excellent, elegant game. So many roads you can take to victory. So many different economic engines you can build.

A little more relaxed than Race for the Galaxy in that you have more time to build up an engine.

A satisfying card game which happens to be perfect with three players, and also good with two and four.  I love card games like this. Play it in a bar, while traveling, take it to your neighbor, play it before bed with your sweetie.  I like it way better than both its siblings Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy.

There are many possible strategies to San Juan, most determined by your starting hand or the cards you draw in the first couple rounds.  The wins in our group have been pleasingly varied in terms of strategy.  

Multi-player solitaire? Sort of. There is interaction, but it is subtle and hard to see at first.  Torquing that interaction in your favor is the key. You need to set it up so that you are [i]in phase[/i] and knock your opponent(s) [i]out of phase[/i].

San Juan is less satisfying with 4. It took me a while to see just why 4 players threw it off - it has to do with the fact that in every round, four of the five possible roles will be chosen. This makes the game less interactive and more predictable. With two or three players, only three out of the five roles will be chosen.

I really like the idea of cards being your resources, your goods, and the cards you can actually play all at once.  Play is very easy and intuitive, and it makes for a nice little game.

Played dozens of times on the computer, very cool.

12/17 Now one of my favorite light-weight card games. Played 3-4 times now f-t-f, have enjoyed introducing this to PR players.

2/2010: One of my group says this is broken (Guild Hall or City Hall). Need to sit down one Saturday and play 5-6 games in a row and find out. Moving to Race for the Galaxy, which makes me feel like I am rediscovering San Juan again, which is a good thing.

2013: also iOS version

May 2013: gave physical copy to brother

Oct 2014: I really used to love this one. But since I've discovered games like Innovation, Impulse, Uchronia, and now Pax Poriana, and even Core Worlds, I've lost enthusiasm for SJ. The iOS App is "ok", but I just...can't...bother myself with this any more. I really appreciate what this game got started. Race for the Galaxy is a LOT better, but the theme means is hobby-gamers only, so SJ would be the natural fit... but I am looking for something else here.

Decent game. Much easier to teach than Race for the Galaxy. Prefer Race over this hands down though. It's a solid game, but it's a bit too simple for my tastes. It kind of falls into that weird "too complex for non gamers, not complex enough for gamers" zone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's Puerto Rico with cards, but much more simplified! It's an excellent "gateway" game to introduce to people who haven't played Puerto Rico yet, if you want to eventually teach them Puerto Rico. San Juan has its own options as well, as one can employ about two strategies: heavy on production or heavy on purple buildings. It misses out, of course, some of Puerto Rico's options, but it's still a quick, light-strategy game.

TRY Feb/05: Exceeded my expectations, as I had been confused by all the buildings in the rules (I had been reading to play on BSW).  However, at a gaming night, my friend explained it very elegantly to my wife and I, making it VERY simple to play.  We played 4 player, and had a lot of fun.

RATING: 7
November 2010: Evidently Race for the Galaxy and San Juan have some similarities (I'm not surprised that the rule booklet mentions Tom Lehmann). San Juan is much lighter, so that it is better suited for casual players (or as an portal to Race for the Galaxy). My wife does not like Race for the Galaxy much, but likes San Juan so I play this once in a while with her. Personally I prefer Race for the Galaxy, as there is more choices to be made, more ways to score points and so on...

Oh...and of course role selection system is very similar to the one in Puerto Rico.

Like Puerto Rico, I bought this and it sat on the shelf.  I opened it, but the mechanics seemed strange enough to me that I didn't expect my wife to like it, so I sold it away.  However, then we had our Puerto Rico enlightenment, and so I bought it again.  I think it's outstanding, and my wife loves it even more than I do.  :-)

This card game is quick to teach, fun to play, and a great game to add to any game night. It's fun with two people or larger groups, the worker placement vibe you get from this card game creates a unique flavor that makes this feel unlike most other games you've played. Definitely recommend picking this up.

It's fun, but flawed. It's better with just two or three, IMO. There's no feeling of missing out on actions when there's four involved. There's something that just grates me about it. Not complex enough, maybe?

RATING: 6.5
Definitely overrated game. A nice game of building, with an enourmous weight of luck and very small (if any) interaction. The small number of roles and the limited power of some of them makes the interaction low even during the phase of choosing the role. It's not the only problem during that phase: it always seems that you can either choose one certain role, otherwise get the miner and a card. No other choice. And every time you get a role, every player will be about at the same level of buildings, resources and money, as soon as with so few roles it will always happen that everyone will build, produce and sell in the same round, unless his position is dramatic. The order of these actions being important exactly in the same manner for all the players.
Pros are that it's length is correct and after all it's easy and light. It would be a 7 if only every single building wasn't written in german. A problem that in PR can be fixed, here, with cards, is much more difficult, and you pass the whole game reading the rules until you don't know them all by heart (maybe after 4-5 matches). The idea of using the cards for multiple functions is great, but then, why create different (and costly) pieces for the prices and for the roles? This game could all be done with a single deck of cards, making it much cheaper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very good game! It's fast, it's good with 2, 3 or 4 and it has a good mix between strategy and depth, and the luck of the cards. Every game is different and there's a lot to learn in selecting the best path to win with the cards you get. That's why I always lose when I play on BSW! I think I actually prefer it to its older brother... or maybe not!
[UPDATE]: This is even better than the previous statement implies. I've been playing it a lot lately and been having a lot of fun! Upgraded the rating (8->9).

[UPDATE]: Downgraded it from 9 to a 7. Race for the galaxy is the sole responsible for this simply because I don't think I'll ever suggest San Juan again. It's still a good game and I don't mind playing it if suggested. But given the choice I'll prefer Race for the galaxy everytime!

RATING: 6
Nice adaption of Puerto Rico. I prefer RftG when playing with people familiar with that game. With new players, San Juan often proves more fun simply because it's easier for them to grasp the game and play competitively. San Juan, more than RftG, seems to suffer from lucky draws of the 6-cost buildings swinging the game. 

The cards in the Alea Treasure Chest expansion are recommended. They do the same thing as the RftG expansions - that is, open up new strategies without increasing the complexity of the game. Great!

Feels like it's in the same cardgame genre as [b]Race for the Galaxy[/b] and [b]Dominion[/b] and it's very clear that the first has taken a lot from this one. It also [i]feels[/i] like it's big brother [b]Puerto Rico[/b] but plays much simpler. I think I prefer this one over Puerto Rico, because of the speed and the fact that it's less fiddly. I can't make up my mind between this and RftG; this is simpler and faster while RftG has more meat but, like PR, feels a little fiddly with all the symbols.

My wife and I played for the first time tonight. Got beat twice.... She likes it a lot. More than Race for the Galaxy. I like it a little. Less than Race for the Galaxy. I think it is the theme more than anything. For me I think this is just a little too simple for my tastes. Obviously not simple enough as I lost both games, but it just felt shallow. Not to say that it is a bad game, but I am kind of wanting more.

Minor gripe. I like the layout of the cards in Race much better.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
So, I prefer Puerto Rico to this little card game when it comes to theme and I definitely prefer the more complex Race for the Galaxy when it comes to the mechanics. If I hadn't already played these two games before, I probably would enjoy San Juan more.

Initially, D gave this a small edge over Race for the Galaxy, but it's still low down on his list (he gave it a 3.5 while he gives race a 3.25) However, after our second game, he admitted that he kind of likes it... boosting it up to a seven!

I intend to use this more as a lead in to teaching friend Race for the Galaxy since the learning curve isn't as great.

When we taught this to Steve's parents, it was one of their first "designer" games, and they loved it.  I think we played it 12 times in a very short space of time.  I was pretty sick of it for a good while.  

More recently, we came back to it after a lot more gaming experience.  I have to say that the bloom has returned to the rose.  I even discovered new good combos, so my new verdict is that this is a game that doesn't grow stale over time.  Many games have come into our repertoire since, but this is still a truly great game.

Played this 2p with girlfriend. I can see it as a good game but might be better with more. 

There are definitely some strategy involved if I don't read the forum for strategy.

With 9 plays and some IOS plays I have the strategy for 2 players figured out. It is actually a good game so upped my rating from a 7 to a 8.

This game is so much better with the expansion. I am happy that I've traded for it. It almost made to a 9 but not quite there yet. Let's see if future plays will increase the rating.

Wonderful Filler+ card game. The manager of the local game store told me that the only flaw in this game was that I wouldn't enjoy it as much after I started playing its big brother (Puerto Rico).  But, I'm happy to report that it simply isn't true. Not only does this give a lot of the buzz of a full game of Puerto Rico, it stands on its own because the (deck / tableau / hand / trick / whatever you want to call it) aspect of the game that comes from the cards is fantastic. The engine aspect is exciting, it plays smooth as butter, and because the length of the game is determined by the number of buildings which are visible to both players - the tension mounts as the game advances and the abilities of the players increase. Such a good game. Really. Fantastic. I keep hearing that Silver Mines & the Library are overpowered, but I don't think it's true. Coffee is a great production card, and combined with an Aqueduct and a Trading Post, you get production and trading bumps on everyone's turn - not just your own turn as with the library. You'll buy what you want at full price and still be swimming in money cards... you'll find that you need a Harbor and/or Chapel just so you don't wind up hand-limited every turn. Great game - wouldn't change a thing.

A light game of Puerto Rico with cards. Perfect. Deeper than it looks, but nice and short too. Best of all, if you want to interest someone in PRico, roll this out, then build up to the almightly PRico as they learn the basic skills in this game. It's also a great portable game (Hive, San Juan, Battleline, and Lost Cities are perfect vacation games).

Nice euro game. Better than Puerto Rico with respects to speed of set up and duration. I like being able to play 2-4 games in a row and have all players still interested after 2 hours of play.

A simpler version of Race for the Galaxy.  My first game was with light gamers and I think that they enjoyed it.

The card combinations are interesting and it is gratifying to see your economic engine churning nicely.

It was fun as an alternative to Puerto Rico.  Luck plays an interesting role that you can manage to a degree through clever playing.  At some point it dropped out of favor and it sat unplayed on the shelf for a couple of years.

"I had the pleasure of playing San Juan with the creator, Mr. Seyfarth, during Origins last month. During the game, we asked his opinion about playing SJ with two players. He told us that the Library cards should be removed for better game balance."

I prefer this to PR as the game is shorter, there are no slaves to trigger uncomfortable images, there is less pussage and the cards have the potential to provide some fun and avenues of victory. Mainly the card based system is fairer by maintaining interest for players of different capacities. Though there are interesting card effect combinations and role/card selection sequencing to consider, players' displays are overwhelming, making player's status difficult to assess and hence I get no competitive tension. Almost typically now, resolution of the winner is a long winded maths effort, which I find dull and makes the experience anticlimatic.

A good way to kill time but the guild hall is a gamewrecker. 

It only works well for four players, and i'd bump it to a 6 for three or four players, but as a two player game i'd give this game a zero. Total luck based on whether you see a guild hall or not.  So call it a 4 overall.

It has the usual Euro component feel, but man it's all a waste except for the cards and trade tiles. The rest is "nice" (the role tiles) or totally a waste (pencil and score pad - you can't count to 20-30 in your head???). Basically, I felt like I paid $23 for a single deck of cards.

Kártyás játék némi kieggel, így belekerültek plusz kártyák, amikkel lehet drágább épületeket építeni, valamint ezzel 6 személlyel is lehet játszani. 

Negatívumok: Bosszantóan hosszú volt 6 játékossal (3 óra magyarázattal együtt, bár az alig volt 15-20 perc), amit biztos lehetne rövidíteni, de nem hiszem, hogy 2 óránál gyorsabban be lehetne fejezni! 
Nem árt ismerni a kártyákat, mire érdemes befektetni, mire nem.
Pozitívumok: Izgalmas végig a játék és folyamatos fejtörést okoz, hogy mi legyen a következő telepítendő lap. Az első helyemhez az kellett, hogy már az elején leraktam egy kápolnát, amire minden forduló végén tettem egy lapot, ami a végén 11 pontot jelentett. Illetve vettem egy céhet, ami ugyan hatba kerül, de minden telepített olyan lapért, ami árut ad a végén 2gyp-t ad darabonként.

Though it uses the terminology from Puerto Rico, the game feels more like a variant of Citadels - select characters and build. As such San Juan is far more random than PR. Card-flow exceeds that of most other card games. The buildings/cards appear to be a bit unbalanced as some are very strong, delivering a lot of points, and others with similar costs, are significantly weaker - get the right card early on and you are unbeatable. Being an Alea game I would have expected serious decision trees...nope, this is a very lite, luck-ridden game with limited choices. For serious play try Battleline, Blue Moon or Roma. Over-hyped, as this is an average game that would have had average ratings if it was not PR themed.

[floatleft][ImageID=117026][/floatleft]Many people say that [thing=28143][/thing] surpasses San Juan. I don't agree with that; San Juan stands on its own. Both games share a number of similarities. I can see why it is so easy to compare the two games but to discount San Juan because of the existence of RftG is ludicrous. I will concede the fact that both games fill the same niche in a game collection and having both games is moderately redundant. It really comes down to personal preference and my preference is San Juan.

The [thing=40688][/thing] does a superb job at expanding this game.

I can't think of a better board game to card game adaptation.  San Juan manages to retain the flavor of Puerto Rico, while still being an interesting game in its own right.  There is certainly a fair degree of luck, but the more skillful player will usually win.  One drawback (for new players, at least), is that you really need to know the deck in order to play well.

A thoughtful and interesting engine-building game. I like that there are different paths to victory, and that you have to pay a fair amount of attention to what other players are likely to do when you select your actions. It does feel a bit dry though.

RATING: 7
Fast, elegant and not trying too hard to be a card version of Puerto Rico.

I would have preferred the trade value thingies were the same size as the role cards so they could be flipped more easily - the narrow pile tends to get knocked over in play.

I wonder if this could work with a player mat with slots for all the unique cards so they are optimally organized for quick play?

Very similar in feel to Race for the Galaxy.  However, this game is *much* easier to learn for new players.  The strategies are more immediately evident, and there's much less to figure out for each individual card.  In Race, you've got to simultaneously learn all the icons and figure how good the cards are.  With this game, its much more straightforward and each card really only does one thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game is straightforward, fast, and fun. Plays like parallel solitaire in many ways as the choice of office seems almost obvious and very difficult to affect the other players. Several strategies seem viable but the decision has to be made early on. There may be some cards that are too powerful... Guild and Chapel for instance.

A very well done adaption of Puerto Rico. You can see its heritage, it captures many of the ideas of PR. 
I prefer it to Puerto Rico.
Very much liked how it used cards as both money, actions you may be able to take, trade goods... 
Like how the randomness of the cards will interfere with your plans. 
The highlight of both games is how the taking the bonus and action of the roles supply the victory difference. 
Playes well with 2 or 3 users - with 4 I'd rather go all in on Puerto Rico.

I am a Puerto Rico fan, and I expected San Juan to be a "dumbed down" version of PR. In a way it is, but I would rather say "simplified" and "randomized".

RATING: 5.5
Good little managing game where you have to try to predict your oponents moves in order to take advantage of them. Some of the buildings seems to be very powerfull and can shift the game toward on player if you can place them early in the game. I prefere Race for the Galaxy or Glory to Rome in the same type of game, but San Juan is more appealing to my girlfriend than the two others witch is a big point in his favor.

San Juan est un bon jeu de management ou vous devez tenter de prédir les actions de vos adversaires afin de vous en servir à votre profit. Certains bâtiments sont très puissants et peuvent faire basculer la partie rapidement pour un joueur si vous les placez tôt dans la partie. Je préfère Race for the Galaxy ou Glory to Rome, mais ma conjointe préfère San Juan ce qui est un bon point en sa faveur.

A very good card game that uses some of the same basic framework as Puerto Rico and then goes off into its own direction. Not nearly as cutthroat, and that can be a good thing.

I managed to grasp the mechanics of the game pretty quickly, which is an important factor that I look for in a game. Most importantly, San Juan is likely to be welcomed by my gaming group as we tend to game casually, and this is all that matters.

Like I said on a hundred other occasions before, I am not a fan, that is, I dislike efficiency engine games, especially if they lack any or much player interaction (I like Kingsburg!). San Juan is another example of everybody doing his own things, just like in Dominion or RFTG. Very limited interaction and usually, at one point, players lose track and interest in what the others are building. Another multi-solitaire game, unninovative and bland. HX
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great game to familiarize someone with role-picking games but often end up being shadowed by Race For The Galaxy (in my collection). Also, major concern here is that two of the buildings are mandatory for victory (without expansion of course). If your opponent has 1+ of them and you don't, goodbye victory. If all opponents know this, it becomes a race towards optimisation, but it circles around quickly.

I've since played San Juan again and I'd like to revise my statements. I like the game. It's fun, it's quick and it's tense.

= 2014-05-22

This isn't saying much, but I like this game SOOOOO much better than RftG. My singlular attempt at RftG stands as quite possibly the most frustrating and unfun experience I have ever had playing a game. San Juan, on the other hand, kept things simple and exposed the core of what this style of game is about. RftG feels like someone played two hours of Calvinball and then took a snapshot of all the random rules he'd come up with by that point. San Juan is more like a casual game of soccer with friends. While I've promised FW I would give RftG at least one more shot before passing final judgement, I'm pretty sure, after playing San Juan, that it won't change my mind. Why? Because I'm not sure I liked San Juan all that much either.

I'm a software developer. I chose to get an MS in Electrical Engineering not because I care about things EE's *do* all that much, but because I liked the science and math behind it. I like the puzzles and the meaningful brain teasers. I've come home from work elated at a particularly mind bending problem I worked through and have cheered myself on as each new function in a piece of code managed to successfully handle yet another special case. I do this for my job now and maybe that has affected the games I prefer. Rather than picking up the latest Feld or Martin Wallace game and hacking through the myriad of Byzantine minigames pieced together to obstruct the puzzle underneath, I'd rather chuck some dice, flick some discs, or rap my knuckles on the table and declare "Gin" while drinking the same. If I wanted to optimize a points engine, I'd go back to the office.

I don't really know where San Juan fits in this. It wasn't a fun enough puzzle to solve and it wasn't a light enough activity for passing the time. I'm pretty sure I'll play it again and I'll keep my promise to try RftG again, but I don't think I'm going to end up liking either one.

Now if I could just get someone to play Glory to Rome with me...

Unbalanced costs for cards, just like Puerto Rico, but it does a good job of translating the original into a more streamlined card game version. Removing the clutter and extra layer of the colonists (and shipping to a lesser extent) was a masterstroke - it keeps the majority of the strategy of PR intact, while making the game quicker. I prefer this to PR, since if I'm going to be playing a unbalanced (yet interesting) game, I'd rather do it in half the time yet still retain most of the feel.

I have only played this 2p, but it is very fun. It captures the feel of Puerto Rico with a lot less hassle. It plays fast, and the three ways the cards are used is an exquisite mechanism. You really have to know which cards can give you the most benefit, and which cards you can give up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Plays much more quickly than Puerto Rico, with less set-up and fiddling with small parts, yet provides many of the same sorts of interactions.  One major difference, and significant flaw of San Juan: in Puerto Rico you can build any building you choose that is still available, usually over 6 good choices, but in San Juan you're stuck with whatever you happened to draw, and that almost never gives you as many as 3 sensible buildings to choose from, and it's often 0, just by bad luck.  This can wreck your whole game if you aren't dealt the most useful cards in the first few rounds. Still, in all, a fun game. Variant: deal 8 cards, discard down to 4, when starting, this reduces bad luck in the opening and changes it to player decision, and makes it a better game.  The more I play San Juan, the more I like it.

This is a game I did not expect to like but did.  I find I enjoy card games and since this game incorporated pulling from a deck of cards and "Lady Luck" along with skill it was very stimulating for me.  This is not a fast game but not a long game either.  Maybe 40 min to hour and a half. There were many ways to gather points in this game.  Resources, buildings, or simply getting a card that allows you extra points. The decisions you make very much effect the outcome but luck easily can come in and mess you up as well.  This game kept you hopping each turn.  It was very competitive with no cooperative mechanics at all.

not sure about how to rate this one after one play. i feel like i could play this again if asked, but the game  seemed a bit thin. it wasn't unenjoyable and i'm a sucker for variable powers, which this game is chalk full of, but i'm not sure there is much more to this game than drawing cards so that you can draw more cards. also, the game lacks the screwage factor found in puerto rico, which was disappointing. 

o.k. played this one again. this game has a clever enough engine, with the use of cards as goods and currency, but it feels like it needs some other element to make game play more interesting.

Oh geeze, I've played San Juan 53 times as of this writing and all I had to say about it up to that point was: 

"[i]Interesting card game; build buildings to get resources to produce more buildings. Get victory points and outmaneuver your opponent(s) to win. This is our most played game, but probably not our favorite anymore.[/i]"

The first couple sentences can describe basically [i][b]every hobby card game ever made[/i][/b]. So what is so special about San Juan that I've played it more than virtually any other game in my collection? Well, it helps that it was one of the first. It's easy to understand but incredibly satisfying to play, plus, skill is a major factor, or at least familiarity. When we bring this out with new people, I don't play the first couple games. I teach and answer questions because if I play I will win handily. It's not as luckless as Puerto Rico but once you understand how the game works luck isn't a major factor in the design anymore. 

San Juan recently received a reprint with new content, I would heartily advise anyone who enjoys card games to pick this one up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've played a few hundred games of this (most of those against AI), and it's become fairly automatic to me.  You either get the right cards or you don't.  If one player gets the good violet cards to open with, he's just going to do better.  Additionally you _need_ to draw the big buildings to win, if you don't find any, you cannot win.  

Despite the flaws, it's still a fun game, but I find it too random and that there is only one victory path in 2 players.  (In 4 players producing is slightly more feasible... if somebody else is doing it with you).

Edit: This is my wife's current favorite. Sure, there are not a whole lot of decisions to make, but most of them are interesting. This has proven to be an accessible and dynamic two-player experience. We've introduced the Treasure Box expansion, which adds a few more layers. We're also working on a variant that has so far been quite fun.

I like Race for the Galaxy and everyone says RftG is San Juan in space.  And it is!  Except not boring.  This game is dull.  And boring.  I would say both dull and boring, but that would make the game sound more exciting than it is.

RATING: 7
Easy to pick-up and rather fast card game. It has some parallels to its bigger brother Puerto Rico (role selection), but it is far less complex, since there is separation of  selling and shipping  and victory points are only awarded for buildings (goods only generate money to buy more buildings).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, quick game. Great card art. Impressive in the way that cards serve as both resources, money, and as "normal" cards. I've yet to adopt any real strategy, and I'm not sure how easy doing so would be, considering the random nature of card draws.

RATING: 9.3
I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but I'm really enjoying it.  I've played mostly 2-person games with my son or wife or a friend.  I've also played a bunch with the computer version.  Don't know all the nuances yet of course.

Update: Now we've had the game for a couple of months and it's becoming one of our top two or three most played games (along with Carcassonne and Carcassonne-The City).  It's a really cool game once you get used to what all the cards do.  A neat feature is that you end up using different strategies based on what types of cards you get early on.  So the game feels different on different days.

Also, I'd highly recommend it as a game for couples looking for a low-confrontational game.  While there are times when you choose to do something that wouldn't help your opponent, for the most part you're concentrating on creating your own city.

Update(Feb. '09): Not playing too much anymore.  Wife and I prefer Agricola, Crokinole, Zooleretto, or Battleline instead.  But I'm sure it's still a great, great game.  And we'll bring it on trips b/c of its size.

Update (July '10): Wife and I are playing it quite a bit on a trip to Bermuda. I just moved it up to #9 on my Top 10. It's that good.  Sure there's some luck in the card draw, but that's cool. And lots of different strategies for each time you play.

Update (May '11): Knocked it back down to an 8.8 b/c in the last month I've learned to love Race for the Galaxy.

After a few plays I must admit that I really like it. Gives you plenty of options for strategy. Non-gamers may find the complexity brought on by the special buildings a bit hard to grasp.

Mostly I play the Mac version of this game by "Jim" and routinely get my arse kicked. I love it. For me this is PR without the complicated rules, fiddly game play and little more infusion of luck...but not too much. I think it's easier to teach than either PR or Race for the Galaxy.

Why not an 8 or a 9? I think there's some balance issues in the game. Some of 6 cost purple buildings will wildly swing a game towards the end while others are almost worthless without combinations of other purple buildings. I think with some more 4 and 5 cost purple buildings that grant abilities instead of just VPs (i.e. more like the library), this game would be nearly perfect.

RATING: 7.5
(9/25/07) - Just got this game, looking for someone to play with!

(12/17/07) - [7.5] - Just played my first games of this today. I have yet to come up with a good strategy, but the game is quite intriguing. A Puerto Rico derivative that is different enough to not fall in the shadow of its bigger brother. Until I can get a better understanding of the intricacies I will rate this a 7.5.

(5/1/13) - San Juan has been sold as part of a larger liquidation of my collection. Never got around to playing it much.

(04/27/2016) - San Juan has returned! I think my recent Roll for the Galaxy kick motivated me to give this one another shot.

Surprisingly successful reduction of Puerto Rico, with cards serving multiple roles as buildings, resources and money. It even works well with two. I still prefer the original board game and its zillions of components. The card game has lost a lot of the original's thematic flavor.

I'd much rather play Puerto Rico, so this doesn't get much play time, other than as a two player game.  And frankly, it is much better with three or four, IMHO.

Edit 11/07: I've actually played quite a few two player games now and appreciate it more as such.  It feels like it has more cards than are useful.  Many of the cards feel like University in PR - nice idea, but no really that useful relatively.  It seems like it too frequently comes down to Guild Hall or City Hall, though I think that shows a lack of experience in the game more than a deficiency of the game.  Need to play more to fairly assess (I've only played ~30 games, far more than I've recorded since I started recording plays late in the game, so to speak).

Am curious about the comments of others - San Juan for 2-3 players; Puerto Richo for 4-5 players.  But SJ does have the advantage of playing in a shorter time frame.  Only disadvantage is that there isn't much one can do to block others (compared to Puerto Rico).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A good card game version of Puerto Rico that hasn't worn out its welcome yet.  At least due to the cards, you have to tailor your tactics to what cards you get, but the game seems to fall to much on which big buildings you draw.

RATING: 4
Guildhall is too good.  The card draws are too random in general -- most cards are balanced on average, but in any given context there is huge variance in value between things you could draw, which is just as random as having some always be better than others.  The randomized market is fiddly without adding depth.  Strong first turn advantage with no mitigation.  Hard to catch up from behind.

I find this one just a bit too random for my tastes.  The six cost buildings are so important to the game that drawing the right one can easily make the difference, and even taking the (usually inferior) Councillor doesn't tip the scales towards drawing them quite enough.  It's fast enough to work as a filler game, though.

13-07-2014. Rated after 3 plays. Puerto Rico: Cardgame. Game in which you draft actions and build buildings to gather resources to buy new and better buildings. Resources are sold for money, reflected by cards. You discard cards to place one of the cards as buildings, that give you special abilities (and few VPs) or just VPs. Endgame is triggered by whomever builds their 12th building. Winner whomever has most VPs. 

I love games like this and regret not finding it earlier. Artwork and design is somewhat drab and the box is too big but the game is lovely. RFTG is now firmly on my want to play list, as I'd like the the theme and art better.

RATING: 8
Good, fast game - 20 minutes with 3 players, 30 minutes with 4.  It can be a bit too dependent on whether a player gets the right 6-cost card to go with what they've already built up, and it can feel unlucky if you never happen to ever draw any 6-cost cards, but it's so short, you can just play again and hope for better luck. I prefer it over Race for the Galaxy - not as deep, but allows for a lot more table talk and just a more enjoyable time playing together.

San Juan is probably more fun than Puerto Rico, but its not half the game. If I was asked to play one it would be San Juan, but I wouldn't pick either if it was my choice.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy this game. It's quick to play and I feel it can be played very competitively between players who know it well. There are multiple strategies one can use to play the game that gives it more replay value in my book. Sure, much can be said for the luck of the draw, but each player draws so many cards over the course of the game that you're likely to see every building at least once, it may just not come when you want it. But there are multiple card combinations you can use to be competitive in the game even if your favorite cards don't show up when you want them. I feel this game gets better with more plays as you're able to understand the relationships between the cards better. You can play this game with as much player interaction as you like. Personnaly, I like to really pay attention to my opponent's capabilities and actions. You can strongl influence someone's likely actions by the roles you play and the buildings you construct.

RATING: 7
A good amount of depth for a card game. It could be considered multiplayer solitare, as there is no direct interaction between players. Plenty of interesting decisions and variability between games. The resources to build buildings are the actual building cards themselves, couple that with the unpredictability of chosen roles, and you have yourself a tense and satisfying game. Building decisions can be especially excruciating. If this is Puerto Rico lite, then I look forward to giving its counterpart a try. I continue to remain impressed with the alea medium box series.

Normally, (by its self), I would rate this an 6, but considering its use as a stepping stool into Puerto Rico, I then give this a 7.  It introduces players to Purto Rico concepts and mechanics, while being much easier to play, faster to complete, and not as taxing.  The randomness of the cards keeps this from being a true 8-10.

Respect a KártyaGyárnak ill. annak aki elkészítette az elektronikus változatot a nyomtatáshoz.

Nagyon szuperül működő, letisztult játékmenet. Ideális akár már 2 fővel is. Klasszikus "kéz menedzsment", számtalan út vezethet a győzelemhez.
Az eredeti árát tekintve kicsit húzós az érte kért összeg, de még azzal is ajánlott darab. (Meg is venném eredetiben, ha lenne magyar kiadása...)
A design az amin még lehetne egy kicsit fejleszteni, hogy még ütősebbé váljon a játék.
Kis helyen elfér, viszonylag kicsi a játék közbeni helyigénye, egy szó, mint száz, bármikor jöhet belőle egy parti! ;)
---
Frissítés: Azt kell mondjam, hogy 2 fő feletti játékos szám  esetén kicsit megborul a játék. Túlságosan megnő a szerencse szerepe. Ha nem jön jó lap, akkor az ember a többiek szerepválasztásának a foglya lesz, és sodródik az árral. Aztán egyszer csak azt veszi észre, hogy behozhatatlan hátrányba került. (Ezen a ponton hiányolom belőle a konfrontatív jelleget, hogy rendesen keresztbe lehessen tenni a többieknek).
Könnyedebb játéknak továbbra is kiváló a gyorsasága miatt, és nagy előnye, hogy kevésbé hardcore játékosoknak is könnyen tanítható.

No rájöttem, hogy a legutóbbi frissítés igazán csak abban az esetben igaz, ha stratégákkal kártyázunk. Családi szinten azért önmagában is megállja a helyét.

Rating has increased after more playes. The first couple of plays, I admit that I just didn't "get" this game or how the various cards worked together. Now, after more plays, I have a better appreciation of the strategy and how the cards work together to generate income and victory points. Have only played 2-player games, but they've been moderately fun.

This game is exactly what it needs to be, a lighter version of Puerto Rico. Its simple enough, and if for some reason you needed to introduce the rules of Puerto Rico slowly, this would be a good way to do it. I hear its also good for two, but I've never tried it.

You have to play this a couple times to get a proper sense of it, so don't give up after just one try if you don't like it. When everyone playing is competent, the scores tend to be very close, which is great. With four players, this game is at its very best, because there is more incentive to try a production strategy. With four players, I rate this game an  [bgcolor=#66FF99][s][color=#66FF99]-[/color][/s][b]8[/b][s][color=#66FF99]-[/color][/s][/bgcolor]  . San Juan is a great step along the way to Race for the Galaxy.

UPDATE: Around 90+ plays (which is awesome), we started to cool on San Juan. Because it got so there was only a couple ways to win. Normally, I eschew expansions. But we gave the New Buildings expansion a try. It rules, and breathes new life into San Juan :)

Is it as good as PR? No. Is it a great game? Yes. San Juan may be a lighter, nicer, more random game than its predecessor but it is still fun. There are still many options and paths to victory which leads to great replayability and at the same time there is some randomness to make it a lighter game. The time is also nice with almost all games under 30 minutes and two player games even faster especially on BSW.

It's kinda like 7 Wonders. There's this feeling of creating something because you can see cards accumulating before you, but it's very hard to imagine what's happening, there's just not enough to go on and some mechanics and building abilities even get in the way. San Juan doesn't even try to have direct interaction, whereas 7 Wonders fakes it. In spite of that, I think I like this better than 7 wonders, because it goes over quicker while really giving a very comparable experience. More isn't always better you know. It's short, cute, goes down real easy, but it ain't too sweet. It's rather bland.

We've only played two-player, but there's always something I want to grab more for more than two. We've also given several other two-player titles a try and they've all only added to my feelings about San Juan.

For me, it fits the 5 rating description perfectly -- an average game, perhaps slightly boring, that I can take or leave. It so pales in comparison to both Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy that I can never really imagine wanting to play it. If I didn't have enough players for PR and my opponent was too daunted by the symbols in RftG -- the only two situations where playing SJ would make any sense, I'd just much rather play another simple two-player game, perhaps the Agricola family game or Dominion.

I originally liked this less that Puerto Rico, now I prefer San Juan. I originally liked Race for the Galaxy better, now I prefer San Juan. I guess it's about time to give this little game its due, hm? 

This is a card game that deserves just about all of the accolades it has gotten. It play fast and light, but with some genuine strategy. I do wish the game had more interaction, and you can basically play on auto-pilot after a few games of it. But it's laid-back, thoughtful, and inexpensive. I think this is one of those card games all gamers should pick up.

RATING: 8
Having played a lot of MtG, I find it difficult to enjoy card games unless they are fairly heavy. I'm glad I persisted with San Juan, because now I love it and am keen to check out Puerto Rico.

The cards in San Juan are like a mixture of three or four simple Magic decks: you see which algorithm your hand leans towards and play that style out. The lack of optimisation is balanced out a bit by good knowledge of your opponents' cards (type and distribution). As a two-player game, this is non-confrontational enough to replace Lost Cities for us, and as a 3 or 4P game it's got more interaction and fun.

Three players seems to be the sweet spot, as there's less certainty about which roles will be chosen. Actually, if it were up to me I would only play this with three people. 4P seems a bit preprogrammed, and 2P is multiplayer solitaire.

RATING: 7
In San Juan players are racing to achieve fame and fortune by building up the city of San Juan.  The winner is decided when one player finishes building his 12th building.  The player at the end of the game with the most victory points wins.  Each round 5 actions are made available through the use of role placards; each role grants the same action to all players, and grants an additional privilege to the role owner.  Each turn players must decide which action they want to take; however, once a role has been chosen it is unavailable until the next round.  The actions vary from drawing cards, building, producing goods, and selling goods (which grant you more cards).  The cards in San Juan function as three things, the building printed on the card, currency (used to build the building), or a good; this simple fact causes players to carefully weigh which buildings they want to construct, and which ones they are going to use as either goods or currency.

The game plays quickly and despite the simplicity of the rules there are some key decisions to make throughout the game.  Choosing the right role at the right time, to either leverage the privilege or deny that privilege to other players, is the main player interaction mechanic, and the fulcrum of your strategy; however, since the cards you draw are random players will need to continually evaluate their strategy and adapt it based on their current circumstances.  Beyond choosing which role to assume on your turn, players must carefully consider how to best use each card in their hand, as some cards must be spent (discarded) in order to win the game.

San Juan is not a deep thinking strategy game, instead it is a fast light-medium to medium strategy card game rewarding careful decisions and adaptability.

Easy to learn and quick to play. There's a fair chunk of luck in cards picked up, but you can make your own luck by picking up the Councillor and choosing the best of five. (Of course if another player has the Prefecture  or library you're screwed.) There's still some of the Puerto Rico feel in choosing the actions, and it does play much faster. I like it for what it is. Found it getting better after a few plays. Found it getting old after a few more. Still, I can appreciate that it's a good game, even if I am a bit tired of it.

UPDATE: New edition with extra buildings is well worth getting. Most games now finish with only one shuffle of the deck during the game. The scoring has been tweaked and all the extra buildings give so many more choices and combinations that I've raised my ranking. It's breathed new life into an already decent game. Not just a minor upgrade.

One of the best 2-player games out there, although it will play with more easily.  Not a re-hash of it's cousin Puerto Rico, San Juan stands on its own with a good mechanic of cards doubling as buildings and resources, creating the difficult decision to spend a card as a resource, or save it to try and build it later.  Little aggression but plenty of strategy similar to Puerto Rico, this is a perfect game to get with your moderate gaming spouse/friend.

This game was a really solid card game, but knowing race for the galaxy, I can't imagine ever wanting to play this.  It was in general too simple, however I thought it did an excellent job at distilling Puerto Rico into a 30 minute card game.  I enjoyed it.

This game is an excellent card game.  Outstanding choice for getting your wife/ girlfriend into "real" boardgames.  I like the theme, the mechanics and the components.  It is a great card game that I think plays very well as a 2 player game.  I have nt played with more then 2 players.  My wife and I play and we both enjoy it.  The strategy is not too involved but there is enough to keep us both thinking and planning during the game.  I can see this as a good couples game (4 people), but I don't really see a bunch of guys sitting around the table and playing this one unless under time constraints.

Not just the Puerto Rico card game.  This one really stands on its own.  Since it's a card game, there's more luck involved than you might think, but there's enough different strategic approaches to the game to give you options regardless of what you draw (most of the time).  Regardless of the strategy you choose, an essential component of it must be a mechanism to get a lot of cards to pass through your hand.  Still, you can go through a whole game without ever seeing a 6 building, and that's bad luck.  I love the idea that cards are both victory points and game currency.

I really like the economy model of this game where a card can serve as currency, commodities, or buildings. After a few playings it seems like the game breaks down into deciding which of the four 6-point buildings you should go for, giving new players unfamiliar with the cards a distinct disadvantage. The scoring pad the game comes with is unnecessary, and if I had my drothers they'd replace the role placards and the trading tiles with plain cards, making the game more travel-friendly. Very interesting game.

RATING: 8
San Juan and Race for the Galaxy are very similar games, mechanically. Each round, each player selects one role (producer, trader, etc.) and then all players perform the actions associated with that role; the player who chose the role receives an extra benefit. In Race for the Galaxy, the role selection is done simultaneously while in San Juan it is done in turn order. In both games, cards have multiple uses: they are played to a tableau to build plantations or settlements or developments; they are used to pay for the buildings being built; they are used to produce goods on plantations/settlements which are later traded in to get still more cards back into your hand. The object of both games is to build out 12 cards in your tableau and have the highest combined score resulting from those 12 cards. Both games involve hand management, choosing which cards to hold onto for building later and which cards to spend for building now. Essentially, they are the same game with different themes. San Juan, however, is much easier - it has a lower barrier to entry (the cards have explanatory text in English, whereas Race has a system of icons/hieroglyphics), but less variety, less depth/fewer strategies. San Juan is not a gateway game, it's got too many rules to be that, but it is a good gateway into Race. Race is the "step up" from San Juan. But, if you're not likely to play often, or with the same people, I would advise going for San Juan over Race - the barrier to entry for the latter can be enough that you may never get to play.

I actually find I connect more with San Juan, Race can be a bit overwhelming. I find, right or wrong, that I tend to enjoy a game a bit more if I have a good enough understanding to compete well and win frequently. I can do that in San Juan - I've never won a game of Race. The trouble with San Juan is that the strategies, once learned, become rote. It's still enjoyable to manage your hand and make the decisions on which cards to keep and which to spend, but at a certain level, these really aren't "decisions" any more - if you're playing a certain strategy then certain "decisions" become dictated/automatic. There's more going on in Race, more ways to win, so this sense of putting the game into "cruise control" doesn't happen as it does in San Juan. But, then, I've played San Juan over 100 times, using the AI, and I've only played Race a few times. Perhaps, once I've crossed the century mark with Race, I'll have the same feeling of "cruising" through the game....

This game is not worth a purchase. Despite the overpriced package, the game is more trouble than it's worth. It's a decent game, and I recommend playing it on BSW, but for me it's more work to physically play the game "irl" than it is fun.

 My wife loves this game. She never turns down the game when asked to play. What is appealing to her is that it is a building game.
 I find that a 3-4 player game is the most interesting. However, to me a winning strategy becomes get the guild hall and build production lands.
 A two player game allows for other strategies like geting the triumph with monuments, guild hall, etc.
 Play length is modifiable by shorting the build limit for end game. Great for a lunch time game. U can even add a fith player and lesson the building limit and add another prospector.

RATING: 7
I know San Juan is Race for the Galaxy's poor cousin, but I prefer San Juan. Maybe it's because of the more direct confrontation (can't use a role if it was picked by somebody else) and/or the buildings are easier to relate to than stupid worlds and developments (not a sci-fi fan). I also like Puerto Rico, so the similar theme doesn't hurt. I think this game would be better if it includes shipping from Puerto Rico, like how Race for the Galaxy did (only thing I like about RftG), and the sweetening of unused roles.

Like this best with 3, as the strategy space is maximized without causing undue frustration. 2-player almost always degenerates into a race of quantity versus quality of building, and some cards (Market Stand, Trading Post etc) seem useless in the 2-player game. 4-player sucks simply because you're going to get stuck picking shitty roles.

4+3

Still having fun with this after lots of plays. Not to be taken as seriously as Puerto Rico due to the inherent luck of the card draw, but it's a good game with a decent amount of depth that can be played quickly, without commiting lots of energy or brainpower to it. Sometimes the decision tree feels rather slim though, especially when compared to Puerto Rico.

I love PR, but I don't quite see all the hype for SJ. It's good but just a little bit too random. I can accept randomness in a game like this, but I feel too far out of control, even in games where I win.

RATING: 8
Puerto Rico-lite, but like light beer, sometimes the light version of something isn't really all that necessary.  The decisions in this game seem a little scripted and, frankly, they aren't all that interesting to me.  It's ok, just not great.  It's portability makes my rating of it a little higher - always better to play this than stare at the airplane magazine.  Maybe I've played with the wrong people, but I don't have much desire to get this on the table any time soon.

I hadn't played this in a long while.  Playing it now after finally learning Race for the Galaxy now makes this game stand out for me.  It isn't Race, but it's much more accessible for new players, while still being fun for veteran gamers.

Excellent at each number of players and different enough to warrant playing at each number, as well.  

After many plays, familiarity with the cards made the game a bit predictable for me.  Luckily, I found that the expansion cards (from Alea's [thing=40688]Treasure Chest[/thing]) breathed new life into the game without changing its character.

2 plays. 

This rating is in comparison to RFTG. Compared to it SJ is too simplified, get samey quickly and because of that it's calculable (you can just search deck for cards you need and you'll likely get them). 

So for anybody owning and enjoying RFTG: you can skip this. However for people wanting a simple and not too complex card game, this one delivers that. (But I'd rather play Haggis).

Very nice. All the good stuff of Citadels and none of the bad stuff, such as assassinations and boring boring cards.

Instead, lots of different options, like building a small magic deck each time.

Getting big buildings is essential, and whoever gets the most wins; getting them and knowing when to play them is important.

Nice expansion cards from the Alea treasure chest. More elegant than Race for the Galaxy.

RATING: 10
[30 plays] [2 player rating = 10] [3-4 player rating = 7] 

Puerto Rico's cute stepchild. More luck, a little less balanced (there are some relatively rare and extremely powerful cards that can make or break your game if one player gets combos early like the Chapel, Library, City Hall, Prefecture, and Guild Hall and others from the expansion like the Harbor), less strategic options, and less diverse mechanics. 

All that said and you might think I dislike San Juan, but you'd be wrong. It is an excellent card game that has some of the Puerto Rico feel with quick, tough choices. With 2 players and a little bit of time, hell yeah!, bring on San Juan. But with more than 2 players, I'd probably rather play Puerto Rico or perhaps another "meatier" game.

[All games post Alea Treasure Chest expansion are played with the expansion. I can't see purposely playing without it ever again, unless maybe teaching a beginner.]

IOS IPAD version.

Have really had to persevere with this one, but after many IOS plays, the game has finally 'clicked' for me.

So much so, I've just purchased the hard copy. 

For me, so much easier to get my head round the rules/game-play than it's older brother, and a much better theme than Roll For The Galaxy (for which this is continually compared to).

Now to see how easy it will be to teach others...

RATING: 8
Elegant adaption of Puerto Rico to card game.  I like it a lot.  A lot of the luck of the draw is mitigated by the fact you have to use the cards you draw to pay for things, so drawing one good card is a good as drawing three.  However, getting the 'big building' you need to maximize your end game scoring is critical and if you are unlucky with your card draws, it will spell your doom.  Still enough meat and enough different strategies in a very compact package to satisfy.

Tried VB-version, and I like it so far.
And even more - I play SJ rather than Puerto Rico, which AI version I've downloaded also. Maybe it's because I found PR rules overcomplicated and therefore a bit fiddle. Maybe PR needs more plays or plays with real opponents rather than solitaire play with AI.
I just don't understand negative hype on BGG. 

UPDATE: Got it from CLS Games, tried it with my family, terrific game. Rerated it, now it's 9 so far.

UPD1: After buying and playing Race for the Galaxy I have to rerate this. I still consider San Juan the great game, but while I may play  RFTG I can't imagine why I should play San Juan. 9 -> 7
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As a card game based off of Puerto Rico, it would seem that this game would have less depth without the colonists and resources.  But the card drafting mechanics and extended building types make this game a lot of fun, even if a little simpler and more random.

While this doesn't affect my rating of Puerto Rico, I imagine having San Juan around will end up making me play it less.

A nice "light" version of Puerto Rico.  Fun and much quicker to play than its older brother the board game (much quicker setup, too.)  A number of  strategies are available to pursue for victory.    My wife doesn't like this game at all and refuses to play it, but the rest of the family enjoys it enough and it has been getting good table time recently.  One major advantage for me is the fact that it can be played *very quickly* and you can get in three games in an hour, if everyone is on their toes.    Update:  The more I play this game (including playing on the computer using the jsanjuan game), the more I like it.  The mechanics, the interrelationships of the cards, the paths to victory, they all add up to a "10" game for me!

Some say it is the little brother of Puerto Rico, I say it is what PR should have been in the first place! more streamline, less complicated rules but not short of anything essential. though more difficult to stop a run-away leader in the lead, but i am still going to rate as high as PR. played my first game today and i wanted to play it again almost immediately. the feeling was excellent. tense throughout the game. long enough to hold your attention and short enough to want to play it again. one of my best buy! have not won it with human players yet though. sigh!

RATING: 10
Does a pretty good job of capturing a PR feel in a card game whose components can be carried around in my coat pocket. After about 50 games I've decided my ratings are as follows:

Two-player: 10. With only one opponent all possible strategies come into play, most of the buildings are useful, and the game is at it's most skillful.

Three-player: 8. Still a good game with three, but not as intense.

Four-player: 6. Four players is by far the worst. There's a chance that one or two of the players won't have a chance due to not seeing six pointers, and with four roles occurring each turn rather than three the manoeuvring is much less interesting.

Rated a 10 at BGG as over 85% of my plays are two-player.

A Puerto Rico kártyaváltozata. Könnyed, egyszerű. A termelőépületek további kártyákat termelnek, amivel a kártyák lerakásáért fizetünk. A szerepek ugyanúgy a választónak adnak kis pluszt, de mindenki végrehajtja őket. Egyértelműen adódik a hasonlítás a Race for the Galaxy-val. Nekem az RFTG tetszik jobban, több benne a lehetőség, egyedibb, nekem jobban kidolgozottnak tűnik. Igaz, azt az ikonrendszere miatt nem olyan könnyű "eladni" az embereknek. Aki a könnyedebb formára vágyik, annak bátran ajánlható a San Juan, én maradok az RFTG mellett.

Update: Man is this game annoying.  I'm just not a fan of games that have a bunch of crap on a bunch of cards.  Build for points, but if you don't get larger point cards later in the game, you are screwed.  Blech.

Wow!  I just finished my first 2 games of San Juan.  Holy crap this is a good game.  I played 2-player with my wife and we had a great time.  San Juan is a great 2-player game with the wife... just like Lost Cities.  San Juan is more "interesting" in that there is more going on.  But it's so different that Lost Cities is still extremely playable even if you own San Juan.

 As with its design predecessor, Puerto Rico, this game is not one you can understand or learn to play well quickly. It is less procedurally complex than PR and can be taught relatively easily. While it features some of the procedural mechanics of Puerto Rico, it is an elegant NEW game. After about a dozen plays, I am learning that it could well take over 100 plays before I can truthfully consider myself adept at its strategy and tactics. In other words, it has a high replay factor; not a game you play and put away on the shelf. Rather, a game you seek out time and again because of an interest in getting better at it. A classic, by definition? The luck factor is a little stronger here, as you sit and wait for the right cards to show up so that you can execute a given strategy, but as with most "luck" games, all players are dealing with the same issue. As with Puerto Rico, I'll be going back time and again to get better, because it is just plain fun to do so.

I liked this game until I played it with people who had played it a lot, and since then it's seemed fairly pointless. Buy lots of purple buildings and hope somebody is dumb enough to plant crops occasionally. There appears to be no other route to victory, and the journey isn't good enough to make it worthwhile.

As a 2 player I find San Juan to be a bit bland. There is not enough player interaction and the actual gameplay is not very exciting. I had high hopes for this game but it didn't really do anything for me. 

Now, i've only tried it with 2 players and it may better with more . I have a feeling that the role-selection part is more crucial with more payers.

Liking this more as time goes on; with players who know the rules, it can give you a fix of city-building (albeit with little interaction) in half an hour or less. Yes, there's a big luck factor, but you can also make your own luck by using the Councillor wisely.

Played twice, and though I think I only developed any sense of a strategy towards the middle of the second game, I enjoyed my playings. It's much easier to pick up than I thought it would be.

RATING: 8
Does a surprisingly good job of capturing the feel of Puerto Rico, while offering a much shorter game.  Like PR, players select a role on their turn, such as Builder, Trader, etc.  The cards in your hand have buildings on them.  Thus, when you build, it is from your hand, and you use the other cards in your hand as currency.  Game over when someone has built their 12th building.  

The fun part of this (like PR) is figuring out what everyone else wants to do on their turn and taking advantage of this by either avoiding that action (because they will do it for you) or taking it for yourself (with the privilege).  One twist that is unlike PR:  the big buildings in this game come up randomly, so it is risky to embark on a building strategy (many production buildings) with the intention of eventually building the associated points-multiplier big building (Guild Hall), simply because you might never get it in your hand.  It's also difficult to hang onto the big buildings early in the game because you don't yet have a cards-generating economy in place and you need to spend your cards in hand (not to mention the hand size limit).  This is my favorite card game for 2-4p.

This might be a touch low at a 7, but I'll have to see if I can get it to the table again to bump it to an 8.  It's a simpler and faster version of Puerto Rico.  I get how the choices of the roles do affect the other players, and the cards are still simple enough to make sense as to what you're going after.  This is perhaps the first somewhat complex card-only game that I have really enjoyed.

UPDATE: It's not bad, but I've appreciated Race for the Galaxy much more.

This is the first card game I played where the cards have multiple uses.  I really enjoy that mechanic.  I seemed to  always use, only one or two strategies though.  After I won the first 16 games of this, my wife said "no more," so it was sold.  Newer games do this mechanic better.  See Bruges.

After playing Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome, learning San Juan is a cinch. It's definitely the least complex and most newbie-friendly of the three. San Juan and Race are a lot alike, like the original Dominion compared to its expansions. For that reason, I can see how Race might replace San Juan with experience. But I can also see how Race might be too much complexity for others; San Juan might be the better choice for them. I don't know which of the two I prefer, but I prefer Glory to Rome to both. Stretching the analogy a bit, San Juan is to GtR as Dominion is to Puzzle Strike: a well-implemented mechanic in a good, reliable game, but just not as dramatic, interactive, or replayable.

While I enjoy playing San Juan quite a bit and will rarely turn down the opportunity (great quick fix for Puerto Rico!), I feel as though the game is mildly flawed in regards to the value of certain buildings and strategies as they pertain to the luck factor.  Furthermore, the two player game can fall apart quickly if certain tweaks aren't made to balance the possible card draws and obvious strategies that result.  With tweaks, I'd rate this one an 8, but as published it suffers a bit.  The fact it can be set up and put away in two minutes, however, more than makes up for any drawbacks.

Edit:  Revised to an 9.  I was too quick and too wrong in my initial criticisms.  Balanced just fine... it's understanding how, within the context of a game, to maintain the balance, that is the trick.  

Edit 02/22/09 After playing again for the first time in geez... nearly a year, maybe?  I'm wondering if San Juan may have jumped the shark for me.  I played it a TON for three years or so and loved it.  But it just felt stale this last play, and I wasn't inclined to give it another go.  For the record, I'm not a fan of RftG, so it wasn't a case of moving on to that game as many others have professed.  I think there are just other games out there I like more.  Still, not going to revise my rating down -- this game deserves the 9, as I played it a huge amount and it took me years to grow lukewarm.

An unbelievably great job of making a card game out of Puerto Rico.  Sequels and spinoffs are difficult in most things, whether it's a movie or a game.  Then you have the added pressure of basing it upon the #1 rated game.  Then you have the design restrictions of a card game compared to a board game.  Excellent.

RATING: 5
Perhaps this game had a place in the world before Race for the Galaxy existed and you wanted to play a quicker card game version of Puerto Rico.  But as of now Race for the Galaxy does exist and there shouldn't ever be a reason to play this game.

If you have the time and want to play Puerto Rico, play Puerto Rico.  Otherwise there is nothing this game does that Race for the Galaxy doesn't do WAY better...so play Race for the Galaxy.

The pace in this is interesting. Very enjoyable and more relaxing then race for the galaxy. I actually tend to pay more attention to the other players which makes it more social and sometimes more fun than race. Obviously race is a better and more subtle game but its great to have both! The expansion cards are essential for opening up new strategies. Really love the 'primitiveness' this in comparison to race.

Sweet little card game that plays quick yet seems to offer different strategies and choices while you try to get the most points out of your little town. Sure, the luck with the cards is a factor that pushes your strategy into a certain direction but since it is a short game I think the luck works well. Played with 3 but seems to fit for 2 or 4 players just as well.
I've heard that "Puerto Rico" and "Race for the Galaxy" play similar yet more complex which makes me really curious about those. I like San Juan but it is lacking something extra shiny to make it great, those games might have that.

Played 2 games Race for the Galaxy the other week - and LOVED it! Worlds of possibility! So when I saw San Juan cheap, I picked it up.

Obviously not quite the depth of R4tG, but still a great game, I think - easy to forget when you're playing that the mechanics (which quickly become commonplace) are fantastic! From role-selection to the different uses of the cards, to the different ways to win, this is a class act!; all games we've played so far have been really close, with 6 point cards (and the Chapel) deciding it - Another Wife hit, too!

Has the feeling that after many more plays, we'll probably be a bit beyond it - not convinced it has amazing replayability, but for now, a definite hit!

Unfortunately called 'Puerto Rico - The Cardgame' in the Dutch edition, this bears much less resemblance to its 'parent' game than you might think. It's all about hand management and choosing the right mix of cards to play. In that respect, it is somewhat similar to the Settlers card game. In both games, certain card combinations make for nice effects.
Of course, San Juan is somewhat eclipsed by Race for the Galaxy nowadays. The funny thing is that I always rated San Juan an 8 and gave Race for the Galaxy an immediate 10. But I hadn't played SJ for more than a year and wanted to try again, curious to see how it would stand up to the usurper R4tG. It turned out I still like SJ a lot. If anything, it has its relative simplicity, maybe even subtlety, which is lacking in R4tG. We played three games of SJ in a row, and I would have wanted to play another game. Conclusion: San Juan is a great game that can easily hold its own against Race for the Galaxy, and really deserves a higher rating than I gave initially.

San Juan is a brilliant little game. It is extremely elegant, very scalable (I enjoy it just as much as 2, 3 or 4 player game) and can be played roughly in 20min.
Simple to learn, it still poses a challenge once mastered, remaining a competitive game. It's very ingenious and original in the way that, the very same card can represent and become, depending on the circumstances, a building, money or goods. San Juan fills a hard to fill sweet spot of balance, scalability and simple elegance.

For a while after acquiring San Juan I thought I'd make a mistake. I like it a lot more now, perhaps even more than Race for the Galaxy -- still quite strategic, but faster, easier to teach, and less fiddly. I even think luck could be less of a factor: San Juan is more forgiving of changing strategies if early investments don't pay off due to poor card drawing.

The extra building cards in the expansion are a must. The rating without them is a 7 or possibly a 6. The Bank validates card-heavy strategies (and the Tower), the Harbour adds a new early-game VP engine, the Residence adds a new wrinkle to building costs, and the Park can (in some circumstances) even validate the Crane. I previously thought the Cathedral was overpowered but subsequent plays have changed my mind.

What I like least is that the common draw deck can make some actions annoyingly fiddly, notably the Councillor. God forbid two players have a Gold Mine, or the action that should be the fastest becomes interminable downtime.

Completely aside from how cleverly its design echoes the design of Puerto Rico -- build just so many buildings during the game and make it happen in such a way that the progression rewards you -- San Juan is simply a nice, unpunishing game where the decisions you make keep working out profitably. The only question is, will the other players make theirs work out better? Even when you lose you know you took an interesting shot at it, and that makes for a satisfying game.

I like the mechanic of using cards in multiple ways.  Seems like there are several viable strategies, and the game plays very quickly.  Good combo.  Can't wait to play it with more.  Update:  Played it with 3 and 4.  Seems best with 3, and I have upgraded it to a 9 with that number.  Would rather play something else with 4.

Great game, easy to teach and to grasp, with enough variation between games that it holds your interest. Perhaps after a lot of plays my interest would fade as I've come to experience most of the possible card combinations, but till then I will enjoy this game greatly! My entire family likes this game; it's our current game of choice, even over Transamerica and Ticket to Ride. Their positive reaction tempts me to bring Puerto Rico home once to play, but I suspect that will be beyond their tolerance.

RATING: 6.5
Based on several plays. Played mostly 4 player games with some of the guys at work.  We all like the game.  But for us it will constantly be compared to St. Petersburg which we also play.  We are unanimous in liking St. Petersburg better.  I just seems that St. Petersburg has a bit more depth and strategy to it.  I love Puerto Rico and have played that a number of times.  I don't like San Juan as near as much as the orginal PR.  It seems not as deep and a lot more luck of the draw with the cards.  Dropped my rating of this game by .5 as some games it is possible to just never draw any of the "6" cards vital to scoring well at the end.

This is a good game which is similar to Race for the Galaxy (but easier to understand), and is a simplified, card-based version of Puerto Rico. Personally I like Race for the Galaxy better. I guess I'm just a sucker for space-themed games. That's just me. This is definitely worth a try.

Great card game that can be great competition for 2 experienced players. My partner and I had a great time learning to play this game together, and developing strategies and counter-strategies together. It probably has more depth than other couple friendly games such as Schotten Totten and Lost Cities, but isn't as daunting as Race For the Galaxy.

Update: as for Lost Cities and Schotten Totten, my partner and I have played this one a lot, so much so that I feel we have reached the top of the learning curve and games are now dictated by luck of the draw. Would still be willing to play as an end of night filler with 3 or 4 players.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite card games.  And it's a nice way to play a faster, lighter variation of Puerto Rico.  I'm glad they resisted the temptation of making this game overly complicated with a lot of bits etc. because I like the quick setup and ease of gameplay.  The solitaire version is an interesting way to try out card combinations.  Not quite portable enough to make it to my top 10 list.  Very replayable.

Very nice!  Just as much fun as Puerto Rico, but plays quicker.  True, you don't get the fun little wooden bits to play with, but the mechanics are well thought out and it seems nicely balanced.  I'm not sure that the pencil and score pad are really necessary though--someone wanted to squeeze a few extra bucks out of the game obviously ...  I almost want to say that I like this better than Puerto Rico, but I think I'd better play a few more games of each first.

A very good card-based game. Obviously very similar in mechanics to the superior 'Race for the Galaxy', which was largley styled on this game. The number of cards means that there's quite a diverse amount of options/strategies that can be employed during the game, which in turn provides a large amount of replayability. I personally prefer 'Race for the Galaxy' as it possesses a fair bit more depth to the gameplay (mainly through the greater number of cards added through the expansions). I think an expansion for this game would certainly add to its longevity and I believe that there is scope for this i.e. extra violet cards. It's still a good enough game on its own, however I just don't think it's going to get played quite as much as other card-based games with added expansions.

Played 10+ times. Much more luck than Puerto Rico, but it's a welcome break from the heavier game.  The fact that the cards are the buildings, the money, and the goods makes for interesting decisions.  It's a joy to play. I'm starting to think that there are fewer possible strategies, but it's nice because it's light. (NOTE: reduce the strength of the Guild Hall to types) 2006/02/06

For me, Puerto Rico is a more immersive and rich game.  The main problem I have with San Juan is that it is too luck based, as you are really dependent upon your draw.  This is in stark contrast to Puerto Rico, which has very little luck.  If Puerto Rico never existed, maybe I'd be less bothered by the randomness, but as it stands, I can't help but think of it as a pale, less satisfying shadow of its parent.

Also, note that there are very good two player variants of Puerto Rico published online that play at least equal to, if not better than, San Juan.

Captures the atmosphere of Puerto Ricoh, without the (possible) drag of Analysis Paralysis. Another good thing? Playtime is about 40min, it's rules are easy and there is still some strategy in it. 

This makes it the best 'filler'/short introductionary game around. Yes, even with RFTG - as non-gamers will have a harder time to wrap their head around the symbols.

Great "little brother" to Puerto Rico, which keeps a lot of the key elements of its big bro.  I love the way the cards act as currency, buildings and goods - a very clever efficiency.

A favourite of mine and Emma's and get regular play. A really good blend of strategy and coping with luck of the draw. You dont play one another so much as just get on with building your own town so it doesnt feel overly competitive but we like it that way and it has a 'nice', 'gentle' feel to it. We still gloat when we win tho! (29/4/09)

It seems to be very interesting for its quick to setup and play and for its original background (Puerto Rico).

A shorter, less bean counting version of Puerto Rico and more fun for it.

Enough decent choices, but the luck of the cards tends to be a bit too swingy for my liking (the person teaching even said "the person that gets this card tends to win").

Update: The game tends to just kind of play itself and I'm not sure there's really any depth here. I do still prefer it to RftG though.

Rating down from 7.2 to 7.

Excellent card rendition of Puerto Rico board game.

Good concept!

The perfect game when you don't have the time to pull out Puerto Rico but you want to play that style of game.  Not too hard to teach.

This is the TOP game that my wife and I play together when it is just to two of us.

Play this with my wife. It took several plays before I managed to 'get' the game. The one concept I learnt from this game that I've carried into other games is this; Never lose focus on the Game Objective of accumulating Victory Points. If your next move might give you a cool ability, but doesn't significantly improve your Victory Points, it's probably not a good move.

13-Nov-07: I've gotten past the 'fixed' strategy of only building high VP cards and now just concentrate on winning with whatever strategy I can think up with using the cards in my hand. Makes it much more fun that way. My wife and I love this as a 2-player game.

The optimum strategy seems to be to decide whether you want to go violet or production in the first turn or two. You cannot hold the necessary bonus building though the game: it's a 1 card hand limit handicap. So it comes down to getting it by chance in the end, which I dislike.

This game requires multiple plays before it gets really interesting. You have to know the cards and how they interact before the game starts coming into its own. Once you know the possibilities, this is really fun. You could argue that interaction is low, but you must be keenly aware of your opponent and how to maximize your gains and minimize theirs with your action choice. I would not play with more than 2 players, though. With more than 2 I'd rate this a 5 or 6.

San Juan feels very familiar to me as a combination of Puerto Rico and Race for the Galaxy.  I liked how quickly it played and the two player game felt like a fun chess match.  Although in both games we kind of settled into our strategies early (one person built buildings, one person did production and trading) so the role selection was straight forward and fairly uninteresting.  But there is the economy management and engine building that is fun.   I'm curious if there are more strategies than I've seen so far.  In our two games there were really only two strategies, so I fear you'll always fall into one or the other and it's just a question of efficiency and lucky card draw at that point.  I'd probably play this over Race (partially because I got totally burned out on Race and it feels more like multiplayer solitaire), but this doesn't quite scratch the same itch as [thing=3076][/thing].

omparable to Race for the Galaxy and like it, very fun. There are enough differences to make me want to play this while Race exists, but not enough to make me like it more.

Firstly, I like that the role selection is turn based and can't be replayed, meaning even though I might prioritize a build strategy, you will still have to do a little bit of production to stay in the game. Production becomes easier and more paramount, even though it loses some of that 'race' tension that RftG has in spades.   

Secondly, while I used to prefer the engine building/combos in San Juan, I wouldn't say it is 'better' but more refined and less chance of not getting the combination you want/need. RftG has an uncanny way of players being able to scramble together something good even if it doesn't go as initially planned, which I find very fun, meanwhile San Juan does it with a tighter card pool. But both make for very good engine/tableau building.

And I like that San Juan is great with multiple players.

A very good game but when Race for the Galaxy was released, it suprassed San Juan. Haven't been playing SJ since. There isn't nothing particularly wrong with SJ, it's lighter and more luck-heavy game than RftG as such it suits very well to some gaming groups and some people but I prefer the possibilities and strategy RftG offers.

I loved this card game version of Puerto Rico at first, but now (especially after playing some two-player games of it) I'm beginning to worry that the luck of the cards you draw has an undue influence on the outcome of the game. The Library is a particular favourite, and in our group at least, whichever player gets one out at the start of the game almost invariably goes on to win.

It's been accused of being like Puerto Rico in appearance only, but I disagree.  I think the tensions between the roles work in much the same way as its big brother, and the similarities are far beyond the superficial.  It definitely has more luck and plays faster than Puerto Rico, either of which may be good or bad things for you.  Personally, I love this game.

Played on iPad for like, 10 minutes, enough to see that it wasn't for me. Lighter implementation of Puerto Rico, a game I acknowledge that is a good one but don't particularly like. I would play Race for the Galaxy any day over both of them, shorter playing time, more variety and better theme.

Love this game. 
After 30 plays, we had favorite cards but the game has continued to grow and we still find new ways to win.

Got both expansions (cards and events). They've added a lot to the game. Especially Harbor for hiding cards and points off trading and Customs Office for a great way to use the Chancellor role.

Recently gifted with the "Prospector's Treasure" a key chain with gold that goes to whomever is the most recent winner. I got it first!

Definitely less interesting to me than Puerto Rico.  This has some interesting mechanics (like the cards being goods, money, and buildings), but there is a huge luck factor in this game.

The funniest thing happened while I was playing San Juan:  it made me want to play Puerto Rico again. The game is that good!  San Juan is elegant, fun, and easy to teach.

It's good for a quick and easy fix but I'd rather just play PR.  The only thing it has on its bigger brother is that it takes just a few seconds to set up and a short while to play.  I also prefer to play the deeper, more complex SJ rip-off Race for the Galaxy, though there's something to be said for SJ's relatively casual simplicity.

Very good card game. Plays well with two players. For newer gamers, I highly recommend learning this prior to playing Puerto Rico or Race for the Galaxy because it makes learning those games a lot easier.

Sold, got the second edition.

RATING: 8.5
Has the feel of PR, but moves much faster.  There's more luck involved than PR, but this doesn't mean that one will lose the game because of bad luck -- players just has to adjust their strategy to the cards that they draw. I've downgraded it  because I found that the main strategies hinged on whether or not you get a certain card making winning the game a little more luck-dependent than I like.  Still, fun, and very quick; if you do lose, you can just play again.

San Juan is one of the better card games I've come across.  Unlike Glory to Rome, you have to build up your position throughout the game so that you can build the valuable 6 point building towards the end.  San Juan also plays differently with various #'s of players.  While fewer players favor a production oriented strategy, in 4 and 5 player, counseling is quite viable.  Deciding what to build and when can be a challenge--one minor gripe, this game has a bit of a learning curve, but its not fearsomely steep.

Stripped down version of Puerto Rico with some of it's own unique qualities.

I love both, but, because it is lighter, faster, easier to set-up/take down, I find San Juan to be more fun.  

Requires very little space to carry or play so it's great for travel.

A version of Puerto Rico that is simple, but still has some meat, is portable, scales well from 2-4 and easy to set up.  
Great!

Update:  Still holding at an 8 and the Alea Treasure Chest expansion might bring it up. I have been exploring Glory to Rome lately, but I doubt it will take San Juan's place.  San Juan is just too clean and easy.

Update: Holds at an 8. Probably played this 30 times and the expansion has kept it somewhat fresh. Regarding my above comment on GtR: San Juan is a better 2-player game, so no worries about San Juan being replaced.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 4

This was fun but is very stale. It seems that even average purple building draws will beat good production building draws. Not that this rule isn't broken, but it significantly reduces the viability of a production strategy. Basically that means that there really isn't a whole lot of variety, replayability, etc. When we got to this point, our rating dropped from a 7 to a 4. Still, it was one of our favorite games until we got our hands on [gameid=28143].

The cards are the currency. Suddenly with just that small change, it plays more like an light CCG. Also, there is plenty of turnover in cards you see, and plenty of decisions that need to be made regarding keeping/not keeping certain cards. Leaps and bounds better than the "big brother" Puerto Rico. Bonus points for reasonable 2 player implementation.

Quick game with some nicely streamlined mechanics.  Very easy to pick up for Puerto Rico players, and not too hard for everyone else.  Using cards for goods, cash and points (under the chapel) is clever.  The order that you receive cards in keeps the game from getting too samey, but it feels like the learning curve is pretty quick as far as optimum strategies go.  We'll have to see how much longer this one holds its shine.  I held off on buying this while I was getting a lot of play out of a friend's deck, and then never looked back after [gameid=28143] came out.  Now I can't imagine ever wanting to play this instead of RftG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The more I play it, the more I like it. Somewhat like Puerto Rico, but plays in less than half the time, and there's no set-up time, so you can play it immediately. It's good enough and quick enough that I sold my copy of PR, and never looked back. Scales very well from 2-4.

RATING: 7.5
I picked this game up used based on a recommendation and have never once regretted it. This is the favorite 2 player game for my wife and I. It's easy to pack, easy to set up, easy to put away. Plays go quick and there's no backstabbing element. The game has sufficient complexity so that each play feels different and there is enough strategy that a sharp player will have a clear advantage over one who is not able to adjust their strategy based on the cards they've been dealt.

The game has a radically different feel with 3 or more players. It feels far more random, far more difficult to control the outcome with purposeful plays. I definately prefer this as a two player game.

**Update: After beginning to play Race for the Galaxy, this game has taken a back seat. Dropping rating as RTFG is my clear favorite of the two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Role-selection is easy to understand, and the buildings are diverse without so many as to burden the game with complexity.  Less player-interaction (and screwage) might make this game more palatable to quieter groups than something like Citadels.  Excellent with two players.  Used this with success several times to introduce players to Puerto Rico.

I still like this game, but perhaps not as much as I did in the past.  I still like the basic game play and appreciate how it scales extremely well from 2-4 and is different but equally good with any number of players in that range.  Lately, however, I'm a bit disappointed with it because I inevitably compare it to Race for the Galaxy, which has many, many more strategic options.  That said, I'll still gladly play San Juan if it is suggested.

RATING: 3
I used to like this game as a two player game.    I never really cared for it with 3-4.  The game can get quite stale.  Once familiar with the game, the game plays you and you really don't play the game.  Its just a series of forced moves.  Its fun until the replayability factor runs out.  The cards given to you play you, instead of the other way around.  It fails to create a single difficult decision for me in gameplay, and I place quite well.  I think the game comes down to whoever gets the better cards, unless someone makes an error.  All the clever plays are obvious after a few games.

Update:  The three - four player still has replayability... but I don't enjoy it all that much.  So many games I'd rather play with 3-4 players.


After playing, I either got the cards or I didn't.  There is nothing I can do to be clever to mitigate the luck, councillor be damned  Meh, I miss the great game everyone really likes.  I just don't see it. There is a low strategic ceiling that gets masked because of the random drawing of the cards.  Its short and fast, its just doesn't hit the strategy game button for me, nor the fun button for me.  

I had it ranked a 5 before Race for the Galaxy came out.  I would be pretty happy if I would never have to play San Juan again, which is a shame because I enjoyed exploring the system, but after the system was explored there was not anything left.

It's fun to play and much easier than RFTG to learn (for my newb gaming friends). Library is a bit OP.

San Juan is no where near as deep, exciting or interesting as RFTG. Below are 2 (of many) reasons why.

1. The only reason to produce goods in San Juan is to get more cards. You can combo the production buildings with a 6-cost card, but other than that there isn't really much substance in it. In RFTG, goods mean a ton of different things, which opens up produce-consume strategies everywhere.

2. Indigo will always suck whereas novelty world goods can get really good with the proper card arrangement. If you've played both games you will understand what I mean by this. In San Juan, there's no way to arrange your cards into a killer indigo strategy when there are silver goods to get. This makes San Juan less deep and interesting than RFTG.

Even though I like RFTG more, San Juan is still fun for me to play and I'm happy I bought it. It's also pretty inexpensive. If you or your gaming friends look at RFTG and begin to cry, try San Juan and I bet you'll love it. Everything is explained on the cards and the rule book is very clear. In other words, you won't need to reference the rule book every 2 seconds for the first 10 games.

I think PRico 2P Alea variant is more interesting than San Juan for a short 2P game. Anyway SJ is a solid and elegant 'PR lite cardgame', with some imbalancing flaws (library is too strong in 2P, see some tweaks to solve it in BGG variants), and several strategies to try. It´s perfect as a gateway for its meatier cousins (Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome)

RATING: 7
Puerto Rico lite version replacing buildings for cards. Play is very quick and fun. There's certainly not the variety of cards/complexity that Race for the Galaxy has but it is ideal to teach people the basics behind the aforementioned two games. I would say that there is enough difference between Puerto Rico and San Juan to warrant a purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not as good as Puerto Rico, but well worth it if time is limited. I suspect that there is some luck in early card draws, such that a player who gets an early break is hard to catch.

RATING: 7
[Rated 2005/05/06 based on 7 plays]

Two-player games seem to degenerate into "first person *not* to build something in a turn loses", but much more enjoyable with 3 or 4.

The fact that the cards you're trying to build are the same as the ones you're trying to build *with* force some agonising decisions as to what you can spend now in the hope you'll see it again, and what you really need to hang on to.

Update: Have played this many times.  Now that I've played Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy, here is my relative ranking: GtR > SJ > RftG.  I know I'm in the minority on Race vs SJ, but SJ is more tight and elegant to me.  Lowering rating to 7.
Note to self - this is not a 5-player game!  (Try it sometime.  You'll shuffle every turn and every role is chosen.)

Very fun game. Not much player interaction, which is similar to Peurto Rico, but that suits my tastes anyway. I love how the cards are used for buildings, gold, goods, everything! Neat. Only played 2-player so far.

I played this game on the computer in the form of JSanJuan many times before deciding to acquire a copy. Boy am I glad I did. It's (not surprisingly) more fun in person. The game is very quick for noobs to learn, teaching itself as you play. The game is very quick-moving, with lots of opportunities for simultaneous actions. The scores are often very close at the end. There is great decision making, and many combinations to be played. A very good game. If you like this, I recommend trying Race for the Galaxy.

RATING: 8
The more I think about/play this game, the more I realize it is a perfect game for me in so many situations. So many different groups can get into this one, as it plays fast enough, deep enough, and simply enough to keep everyone interested. Add to all that the superior 2 player game (which is to say, one of if not the best 2 player game made) and you've got a consistent winner that travels so much better than it's cousin Puerto Rico.

There seems to be a big desire in board gaming to create more of these medium-length, mechanically-simple yet strategically deep games. But I have yet to see one better than this....EDIT: until Race for the Galaxy. I won't go so far as to say this game is now obsolete, but for me, for now, it is. I will keep it highly rated because I can still appreciate it's qualities, but I don't need to play it much anymore because I would rather get in another RftG!

Our first game. We enjoyed it a lot, it was of the right length and depth for us, but we burned it out quite fast, partly because we also both played it a lot with Jim's San Juan (don't play computer versions of your games, lesson taught!). We haven't played it since a long time now. Would love to have the expansion, but owning no other alea game, buying the treasure chest is not an option. We will still play it sporadically I guess.

RATING: 4
down from 7.5.  my last play (or 3 if you count the previous 2 where i had "good" games and my wife didn't) were decidedly unimpressive.  too often one player gets behind early and then has a completely crap time of it.  with little to no way to catch up.  this may in fact be a rare occurrence, but it is too often for me to really like the game.  others may say that we should persevere, but why?  we've given it 4 games and it hasn't clicked for us.

would much rather a) play a different short cardgame, or b) play Puerto Rico (which i LOVE).

put another way:  too often player A had no good move, and every move s/he could do would massively benefit player B.  and player B always seemed to have a move that massively benefitted herself, but screwed over A.

too many unfun runaway games.

Ranked highly on BGG and with a very good reason. Reasonably quick to play (and it feels even quicker :)) and while there is a significant luck factor you never really get shut out of the game, so its not ever a problem where you are just trailing everyone else for the whole game ( which isn't long anyway) because of a poor early draw a la Runebound, where an early death can cost the game if you are unlucky, and a relatively pointless next 2 hours. No, SJ is very very good, and even the most powerful buildings get less so with more people, reducing the luck factor further. Can't praise highly enough, love it :)

My wife and I play a lot of 2 player San Juan. Once you get used to the cards the game plays very fast with a lot of tension. Its more of a friendly race without much interaction with opponents.

Keeps the flavor of Puerto Rico, but much simplier.  Actually starting to like this way more than Puerto Rico.  It's shorter and there's some chaos to the game since you don't know what cards your oppenents hold.

RATING: 5
Good End of the Night game.

Broken: 1st round Chapels. Not so much more the accumulation of victory points as the chapelling of cards you don't want other players to ever get, like 6 point buildings.

I used to think the Guild Hall was broken, but I've built that as my first building and did NOTHING BUT try to maximize it as many cheap production buildings as possible. Yet I came in last place.

A variant I've seen is 2 points per Production "type" for the Guild Hall.

A variant I want to try: No cranes. Every player can perform the crane ability once per game for free.

An inoffensive but too simplistic card game version of Puerto Rico for my tastes.

The market slips are just not varied enough to really matter, which results in the production buildings feeling bland.

Eliminating PR's shipping also reduces the underlying strategic tension of its older brother, making this much more of a tactical exercise.

I admire the system, but it doesn't work as well as I'd like. The small number of roles and the fairly rigid sequencing of some of them means play is more predictable than in Puerto Rico. There is also quite a bit of randomness - not too much if the rest of the game really excites me, but San Juan doesn't, so it does bother me. I think 6 is a fair rating for San Juan, but now that Race for the Galaxy is out I can't see myself playing this any longer - RftG does everything San Juan does, but ameliorates the luck to some extent, offers more paths to victory, and if anything is faster.

This game is really not as good as the hype is. It is decent, but not at all in the top 150 games. The concept is unique since other games like RFTG is using the system. But rather dull, no interaction beyond card play and certainly not much role choice in between. Not sure whether I can give this a really high grade. Several more plays with more players may change my mind.

Nope. Pales in comparison to PR
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm a huge fan of Puerto Rico and think this is a nice card game spin-off.  There is a bit of strategy deciding which are the most beneficial buildings to build each game, however you will find you develop some favorites.  Has the same feel as PR early on when there is so much you want to do, but yet you don't have enough resources to.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a nice game. However, I think that there is maybe too less interaction and variety so that after 5-10 games the games start to feel maybe little bit too much the same.

I think also that San Juan does not play well with 4 players, that is because there is just 5 actions cards and the fourth player has only 2 choices left and third player only 3 choices.

It's light and fluffy enough, and I've played it often enough, that it's become stale with 2 or 3 players.  The 4p game still retains a bit of freshness, but the problem is that if there are four people, chances are we want to play something heavier.  (SJ gets pulled out most often as a filler while waiting for people to show up.)

That being said, the game has provided much enjoyment in the past- I originally rated it an 8.

This might lead me to play Puerto Rico more. It borrows some mechanisms, and of course the theme. Otherwise, the good points relative to PR are that it plays much faster, and is simpler and easier to pick up. Bad points: much more luck than PR and less depth. Overall it is less intense, with less head to head competition for scarce opportunities (in PR the many ways of denying another player are almost a fetish; in SJ it's still a factor, but not key); it's more of a development race. I wouldn't say this is a truly great game, but it's deeper than it appears at first glance, and I enjoy it. I think a lot of PR players were disappointed by this being a lighter game, but on its own merits it's fine.

Fun, fast, colorful, and portable. I've never played Puerto Rico so I can't compare it, but San Juan is a great game in its own right.

Now that I've played Race for the Galaxy, San Juan has lost some of its luster. Farming sugar is hard to compete with colonizing planets.

Card game re-implementation of "Puerto Rico". Uses a unique mechanism where the cards not only serve as the buildings printed on them, but also as goods sold to obtain more cards or as currency to purchase buildings. Interesting mechanisms though it started to quickly fade for me after a few plays - the strategies seemed rather repetitive to me (go for either a "Violet" or "Production" building strategy depending on your initial cards). I felt like the luck of the draw would dictate whether you could pull off that strategy - the player that did would win. Traded along with "Colossal Arena" for Saint Petersburg in the 2008 Montreal Mathtrade.

I like this game.  Sometimes I really need a lighter version of Race for the Galaxy.  It's different enough to give a bit of a different feel when playing.  Gift from my super generous Secret Santa of 2008.

We have been playing this rather than puerto rico. People can sit back and relax during this game, resting on the backs of our chairs, sipping wine or beer, cracking jokes and ancedotal jibber jabber..a lazy man's puerto rico....in contrast, in puerto rico we are all hunched over the edge of the table plotting our next move....anxiety, anticipation, holding our bladders until no longer possible. Last game i got a chapel in the first round and just milked that thing for all it was worth....and i won by eight million points.

First time I tried this game, I was still fairly new to hobby gaming, and the way things interconnect didn't make sense and I almost traded it away.

Revisited it more recently and I'm hooked on it now.  Really an elegant little game.  Great little engine-builder in a small package with a short play time.  You'll see all of the cards there are to see in your first play through, so I wish there was a little more variety, but with what's included there are several paths to victory and you'll likely never have the same result twice.  Every turn is full of tough decisions and risks, it's great!

Defiantly this game keeps things interesting; the more players that there is, the better – that even includes combining two San Juan game to have the eight player variant.  BUT, I am starting to think that this game is more of chance and luck than strategy; there is nothing that you can do if against other players’ chapels in play if you never get to draw a counter action card.

The downloadable game against expert computers is very good and highly suggest to play.

[-] loose the shipping vs building strategies from PR, here produce/consume provides gold/cards but no VP. in the end there are fewer viable strategies.

Puerto Rico card game.  Not all board games translate well to card games but this one does.  In fact I think it may be slightly more fun than the original board game.  Of course that's probably because I tend to enjoy lighter games and this game is a little lighter than the board game.  All the mechanisms are the same except that the cards multitask as buildings, spices and money.

The discarding to pay for the other builders reminds me of some CCGs that are out there.  I enjoy it more than its parent [gameid=3076], but that's not saying much for me.  This goes lightning quick, and makes for a good two player game.  Lots of interesting decisions.  May lie a hair on the luck-based side to make it replayable more than a handful of times, but I like it well enough to play it every once in a while.

Nice job of taking one of the Puerto Rico systems and abstracting it into a clean, fun game that can be played in a lunch hour.  Lack of choice of buildings to build can lead to some frustration.  Rather dull with 2, very good with 3, excellent with 4.

Card game based on Puerto Rico, and the bridge into Race for the Galaxy. How could i not try it?

Compared to Rftg, San Juan is more structured and gives similar feeling to Puerto Rico, but not enough variety for me.

Originally i bought this as gateway for my favorite game RftG. Turned out i didn’t need one, so this game is leaving my collection. I still want to try the 2nd edition, though.

Andreas Seyfarth (Puerto Rico); A card game based on Puerto Rico. The pack of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and "violet" buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else. Cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.In each round or governorship, each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or building. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply. Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanics. In particular, there are no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked. Victory points are gained exclusively by building, and the game ends as soon as one player has put up 12 buildings. Many fans of San Juan find it to be much better as a 2-player or 3-player game than as a 4-player game.

This is a card game with the "flavor" of Puerto Rico, and you get to pick roles like you do in the original game, but the similarities sort of end there.  It's simpler, plays more quickly, and takes less time to set up.  That's always a plus for me.  It's a better game for 3 and 4 than it is for 2, but the neat thing about the 2-player game is that you can manipulate your strategy, since you get to pick two roles every other turn, to your best advantage.  I think the game scales fairly well, given its complexity and different methods for scoring.

Sadly, now that I have Race for the Galaxy, I may never play San Juan again.

Does to Puerto Rico what T&E card game didn't do to T&E, namely make a perfectly functioning slightly simpler mini version, with enough of a twist to make the gameplay different.  Unsure as to the random effect of what you get the opportunity to build, though, so this ranking may well drop.

This game just didn't do it for me. I don't mind a lack of theme in a game but in this case, it is incredibly pasted-on. Furthermore, I feel that there are some very dominant late-game buildings that are almost must-haves.

Interestingly, I happen to love RftG, which is quite similar to San Juan. I guess I find the SJ theme very unappealing.

Great game. plays awesome with 3, still good fun with 2. More strategy than it initially appears. The game plays quick, its not a nasty game, so no hurt feelings as no one gets attacked.  This is our go to card game right now. We all love it. One con is the market value cards were made thin, and are a pain, spend the extra nickle and make that the same size as the other role cards.  I wish the artwork was more vibrant and not as washed out looking. Overall, this should be in everyones collection, very portable and universal.

its ok, light and fun, but it just seems a bit too simplistic for my tastes, and it also takes a few games to suss out the relationships between buildings, thus turning off new gamers from the idea.

RATING: 7
An excellent card game adaption of Puerto Rico. Very innovative card mechanics, particularly in the multi-use cards that act as buildings, resources and money...all depending on how they are played. San Juan packs a lot of fun into a fairly quick little card game.

Update: San Juan has been somewhat retired from our game group after the release of Race for the Galaxy, which re-uses a lot of the mechanics but adds a bit more meat to them. We still keep San Juan around, as it's easier to teach than Race, but almost everyone who learns eventually graduates to the newer game.

A fine translation of Puerto Rico into the card game format. I think it plays better with 2 than PR does, and is certainly a shorter game.

It's a mistake to think of this as Puerto Rico the Card Game.  It shares a setting, a mechanic, and some building names.  But it's not a different version of the same game.

Not up to par with its older sibling, but few games are.  Good tension between accomplishing your plan and dealing with circumstances as they come.  Nicely paced, which is a huge bonus for my wife (who is also a big PR fan). But it too easily degenerates into the same patterns over and over, which grows wearisome. The buildings are also imbalanced; I dislike games with a mainline or default strategy, and this has some of that.

Based on the very succesfull boardgame Puerto Rico, this cardgame version is also a lot of fun. Set up is a lot quicker though, but the popular mechanic is still there. It ends up to be a very fun and fastpased game. Always nice to see this back on the table.

This one's growning on me after a few games. Played mainly 2-players so far with a couple of 3. Deeper than it seemed on first blush. It's not PR, but it does have some of the feeling of its older brother. Upped from a 7 to an 8 after nine games. Initial concern that a player getting behind the curve had no chance of catching up. Also concerned initially about the power of the Guildhouse but I'm coming to think that it's perhaps not so overpowered.

I liked this better than Race for the Galaxy or Puerto Rico itself.  Although admittedly I need more Race games under my belt to see if it finally clicks.  No luck so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A simpler Race for the Galaxy,  using the Puerto Rico role-selection mechanic.  Uses the innovative mechanic where cards are played as both the buildings being built,  and discarded to pay the cost as money.

San Juan suffers a bit by having very few avenues (maybe one and a half?) for victory, with some cards being much more valuable than others (*cough* Hall *cough*).  On the other hand, you can view this as being elegant and streamlined.   It is a card game,  so there's a bit of a learning curve figuring out what all the powers are.

Not a bad optimization game,  but much rather prefer RftG for diversity of choice and strategic complexity.

RATING: 8
What I Like-
Tableau building. Building combos/economy to fuel later purchases. Many ways to build your engine but all lead to only a few overall strategies. The tension of using cards as the building or the currency. Role selection timing to your own benefit.

What I Dislike-
Limited strategies. Sometimes luck of the draw never allows you to see a 6-building that you need to gain the points from your strategy.

Spin off from the board game Puerto Rico. Although the card game inherits mechanics from the board game (choosing roles, producing, building...), the card game feels and plays much different. For me, it's a bit more accessible than the board game and has a higher 'fun' factor. More luck than the board game but it's not irritating. Plus once you know the game, you can play it under 30 minutes. In summary, a challenging and fun card game.

Best card management game for me, easily played in under 5 minutes. The original Race for the Galaxy. I enjoy this one more for its simplicity and it isn't as overwhelming as RftG. You usually cycle the deck at least twice and a new player can see and understand all of the cards at a quick glance. I understand complaints of a lack of depth and minimal winning strategies, but making the same game more complex (i.e. RftG) doesn't always make the game better.

I've only played this once, and have never played Puerto Rico.  Admittedly, I was a little lost at the beginning of the game, but was getting the hang of it by the middle, and I think I had it by the end.  I probably shouldn't have rated this without another game or two under my belt, but if I get a chance to play again I'll update my score accordingly.

I enjoyed it, once I started understanding what I was doing.  I think there's a fun game here, and I like the different roles you choose each time, and the various ways you can use the cards by playing with them or paying costs with them, making you pick and choose between whether you'd rather use a card as generic payment or for the specific thing it can do for you.

I look forward to playing this again.

San Juan has the dubious distinction of being the first game that everyone but me seemed to enjoy.

Played numerous times face-to-face, and a lot on BSW (with 2 to 4 players). I really started enjoying this game when I stopped considering it as a light Puerto Rico. It is a game by its own, with different ways of playing, strategies, and strong points. I appreciate that it plays differently with 2, 3 and 4 players (and probably enjoy it more with 3). Despite some initial fears, it is very well balanced. Of course, being a card game, it suffers from possible luck of the draw problems.

Heavy for a card game, about equal to a CCG. Takes the economic optimization challenge of Puerto Rico, simplifies it in several ways, but then adds the randomness of card draw which limits which buildings you can choose to build. A fun challenge. Great with 2 players.

One of my favorite card-based games. It involves a reasonably amount of strategy and is difficult and random enough to warrant many plays without getting bored. The one problem I have with this is that there have been many games where I have seen no or very, very few "6" cards, thus almost inevitably destroying one's chances of winning a game. However, there is no way around this, and as annoying as it may be, it also shows the game's penchant for veering towards random outcomes at times.

Had I played the physical version first, I would have likely enjoyed it more but I've played the app dozens of times, and it's just more efficient, especially when it comes to end-game scoring!

This is what I call "Puerto Rico Lite". It a very quick and easy game to play and is one that I have really enjoyed playing with the family. It has also gone over well as a lunch time game.

While it does give a lot of the feel of Puerto Rico, it loses a lot of the tension and strategic elements of its larger sibling. There's also a lot more going on in Puerto Rice as well but San Juan plays in a fraction of the time.

The game uses the same "variable phase order" of Puerto Rico where during each round, players takes turns choosing specific roles and undertaking those specific actions. Where it gets interesting is that all players are able to utilize that role simultaneously but the individual who chose it is able to perform an additional benefit. It's a simple mechanic that actually brings forward quite a bit of strategy when having to take in to account timing while also trying to keep pace with your opponents.

The game takes advantage of using the cards for multiple purposes as well. You can use them for buildings, money and goods, and they also represent end game points. Being able to build structures that give you additional benefits is also great.

All in all, this is a very enjoyable and quickly playing card game. I have currently played it to a point where I'm needing a bit of a break from it, but it's something that I'll definitely hold on to.

And then we played it as a 4-player game with some friends and it was a totally different game. Very much more engaging.

Karcianka. Mini-Puerto Rico. Wybierasz role i wszyscy robia to samo rozwijajac swoje miasto. Buduja budynki, produkuja towary i sprzedaja je. Kazdy budynek ma inne zalety. Najbardziej wartosciowa kolonia zwyciezy.

Horribly overrated game.  With 3 or less players, the library is completely broken and needs to be removed, unless you don't mind a game that is decided by who happens to draw this one particular card.  Once you take out the library, the game becomes more balanced, but less fun.  Isn't in the same league as Puerto Rico and is definitely not a substitute.  One nice thing about this game vs. PR though, the setup is much quicker and so makes for a better game if you have limited time to play.  Also, the box and components themselves are the nicest of any game I own.  The plastic insert that holds everything is a work of art.

A watered down version of Puerto Rico that keeps the core mechanic of role selection intact. Only buildings are involved, and the lack of shipping does make it slightly less interesting.

A light card game version of Puerto Rico, it's a sound game that rewards good strategy and it doesn't take too long to play. 

If I play this again and enjoy it I might considier replacing this with the newer edition to get the expansion cards

Millions of years in the future, when shiny robots sift through the remains of our gaming civilisation, they may well stumble upon San Juan, declaring it, rightly, to be one of the most valuable artefacts of this epoch.

The coin-card mechanism is genius. That's it. Said.

San Juan is all about building the most efficient economic engine - which is the sole reason I can't justifiably rate it higher, being the theme-whore that I am.

Suffers from the existence of Puerto Rico (poor man's Puerto Rico) and Glory to Rome. That being said, it's a soft way to introduce someone to Puerto Rico, play 2p, or play while traveling (fewer game components).

RATING: 6
The game flows nicely and is easy to learn, but provides some decent decision making every round (an indivudual card might be a resource, building, money etc... what is it best used for?)  I can't really find a strong con for this game, but it got somewhat repetitive to play... I don't think there are more than a couple strategies and whether the one you choose is successful or not comes from the draw of the cards.  A common attribute of card games I know... but I think I was looking for something more with this one.

Basically a race to the finish.  What your opponents do usually have little to no effect on your choices, besides the fact that you do not want to pick roles that will greatly benefit them over yourself.  Always important to have buildings in the beginning that will restock your hand as fast as possible.  I do like San Juan quite a bit, but I think after several games under my belt, the flow rarely changes, nor do the decisions you make.

I've really enjoyed the games I've played so far on BSW.  I have yet to play any games F2F, so my rating is tentative as I get more plays under my belt.  Very cool game; same feel as Puerto Rico while being a distinct and different game.  Luck a big factor and somewhat of a turn-off.

An impulse purchase to relieve finals week stress.  We are very happy with it though.

It took us quite awhile to notice some good strategies, but I would say that we are still learning what is most effective.  I think ultimately, you have to be flexible depending on the cards you are given.  There is also enough luck to really throw it off.  I think of all the sessions of this, only two haven't been two-player, so I will have to see how that changes things.

Update:  I finally figured out how the Crane is useful.  (About two years after we bought the game...)

Fun, fast card game that captures some of the Puerto Rico's feel. But as this is so fast this get played a way more. I like this more than I like RftG. This is more simpler, easier to grasp and teach and faster to play. In RftG you get overwhelmed really fast, this stays more manageable. Sometimes simpler is better.

After 10+ Plays: In the past I would have probably rated this a 9, but it has since been completely replaced with Race for the Galaxy.

I suppose I would still be willing to play it on rare occasions if someone else really wanted to, but I don't see ever suggesting it again.

This is a fun, versatile card game that has of late been overshadowed by "Race for the Galaxy" for many, but I believe they can co-exist. The biggest issue I have with it now is the same I had with it when I first played: The theme isn't very exciting. Still, the game offers a beautiful balance of strategy and tactics. Certainly one of the most interesting card games I know, and now made even better by its expansion(s).

Interesting, but not as deep as I had hoped.  There are some great resource management aspects to this game as the cards have multiple functions.  This'll come out as a nice filler game between the heavier games on game day.  It fills the same role as Fairy Tale for our group.

Rating has dropped somewhat since Race for the Galaxy scratches the same itch with more depth.  This one doesn't coexist well with RftG in my collection.

2-player version is definitely not as enjoyable.

Despite Puerto Rico's clever role-selection mechanic remaining intact (as long as you play with 3+), the random elements of a card game, coupled with the added randomness of the Trade action and the fact that some buildings are strictly superior to others bring this one down quite a bit in my book.

On the plus side, it's pretty easy to teach, and plays rather quickly. Given the chance, I would still much rather play RftG over this.

I prefer it over Puerto Rico, due to shorter set-up and playing time. There are not the dramatic choices about trading/shipping, so that a game will never be spoilt in single turn. And the box has a perfect tray!

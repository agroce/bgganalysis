Neat little pathing game.  Nice scoring mechanisms.  Good components in a thin box.  The "first to score a number gets full points" is rather thought-provoking and provides all of the player interaction in the game.

RATING: 5
A very light filler where players extend their line in order to reach VP-earning hexes and to maximize the coverage of their line, so that they don't lose VP. Often, the game feels a bit like a balancing act as you want to reach the VP-earning hexes first (more VP) but doing so often means extending your line in precarious ways. This all sounds quite interesting... but truth be told, there isn't much depth here. This is the type of filler you play because it is easy-to-learn, quick, and takes up absolutely no space. If it was much longer, I probably would avoid it.

Met een white board marker trek je een lijn op je bordje, op de kleuren die getrokken worden.
Daarmee probeer je alle getallen (liefst als eerste) te bereiken.  Verder probeer je ook zo veel mogelijk velden op je terreintje te bezoeken.
Let op dat je geen half terrein afsluit !!

Not a big fan of short games but this is a nice little fun and short game that I feel works a little bit frustrating sometimes and can feel a little repetitive sometime but still a fun and simple game. I enjoy a game or two in bed before sleep

Not entirely sure what this game is trying to accomplish in its existence, but it's a nice light filler.   Not a whole lot to think about, and nothing worth playing that often.

If you like multi-player solitaire puzzle games like Take it Easy, Karuba, Wurfel Bingo, Finito, etc, you'd also probably like Traxx.

The goal of this one is to draw a single continuous path across the hexes on your personal board, crossing through as many hexes as possible, while also beating your opponents to specific hexes that are worth more points for reaching them first. Each turn, a card is flipped showing colored hexes that you may cross through on this turn.

So, everyone is solving the same puzzle; it's just a matter of who does it the best.

I liked the game well, as I enjoy this sort of game, but I also felt this one is less replayable than similar games in this vein, as you're using almost identical boards every game, where the point hexes are in the same places. I would have liked to have some way to make this more variable rather than static. Otherwise, I enjoyed it!

Male auf einer Tafel aus Hexfeldern mit einem Filzstift einen optimalen Weg, um möglichst schnell Siegpunktfelder zu erreichen und möglichst wenig Miese am Ende zu kriegen. Der Haken: der Weg wird durch Karten vorgegeben und zwar Feld für Feld. So strichelt man sich lieb, charmant und nachdenkend über die Folie. Ein Spiel, das Kinder gerne gegen Erwachsene gewinnen, weil sie schlauer sind.

The art and colours are awful so my expectations were rather low... but what a brilliant game this is ! An abstract tactical game where all players are trying to make the best route on their individual player boards while scoring points by being the first to pass certain numbers. Great filler game

Bokkensprong 23/10/16. Eenvoudig, kort spelletje (15 min) voor vier. Per ronde wordt een kaartje omgedraaid met 4 of 5 kleuren. Die kleuren mag die kleuren aanduiden op zijn eigen speelbordje met gekleurde zeshoeken. Aanduiden moet met een doorlopende lijn die zichzelf nergens mag kruisen. Je mag de lijn ofwel aan de kop, ofwel aan de staart verder tekenen. Als je een vakje met een cijfer bereikt, scoor je dat cijfer in punten (als je de eerste bent die dat cijfer bereikt), of de helft daarvan (als iemand anders je voor was). Aan het eind krijg je een strafpunt per vakje dat niet werd aangekruist.

A great filler game unless you're playing with slow players who confuse this game with a strategic game and peek at what other players are drawing before they make their own decision in order to score the big numbers full by being first.

I like this better than the competing bingo dice games by Benndorf (Qwixx, Qwinto, Twenty One).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very clever game in a very crowded space. Yet another in the "draw common card, each player makes simultaneous decision" (a.k.a. "Take it Easy") type game. Feels different due to the drawing element. I'm not sure there's enough variety, since players could potentially follow very similar paths. But if this is successful I would anticipate very easily designed add-ons and alternate maps.

You have to compliment the publisher for including high quality dry erase markers rather than the cheap garbage usually included in these types of games (Say Anything, Wurfel Bingo), Ta-Daaa)

This game is simple, but has a clever, unique feel to it.  I love how easy it is to get into yet there really are some interesting decisions to make and strategic play is important.

Excellent drawing-based filler. Each turn you extend either end of a line along a hex grid, filling some or all of the the colors that were revealed on a card. Hopefully, your line will cross some of the numbered spaces, which will score you points (which are halved if someone has previously scored that number). The game ends after 15 cards are drawn, and each untouched hex incurs a one point penalty. The scoring mechanism, which awards full points only to those who first score a given number, mark an improvement over most games of this sort (e.g. Take It Easy, Cities), reducing the impression that you're playing a multiplayer solitaire game and turning it instead into a game of brinkmanship.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Traxx is another game in the same vein as Karuba and Avenue because you are building a route to move around a map and score points. While Karuba has the best theme integration it is also the most fiddly to set up and has been a major detractor from getting it to the table. Traxx removes all pretense of theme and is a map made up of colored hexes with numbers 2 - 10 scattered about. 

If you're old enough to have played Snake on the Atari you'll feel right at home playing Traxx. Each round a card is flipped showing the colors you can move through that round. The only rule is you must start at one end of your line and lines can never intersect. You're trying to get lines through the numbers to score points while also going through as many spaces as you can [i](empty spaces are each -1 at the end of the game)[/i].

That's the game, if you're a fan of spacial puzzles you'll probably love Traxx. Games are brisk, you can get a couple of games in about 20 minutes or so. The boards are dry erase so you don't have to worry about running out of sheets (although Avenue gives you a huge pad).[/i]

RATING: 6
Träxx is a fairly enjoyable game of [thing=131260][/thing]-like proportions, and also plays like a simpler [thing=162107][/thing]. A card with coloured hexes is drawn every turn, and all players attempt to link up hexes with the corresponding colours to the current path on their personal boards. There is a race to reach high-valued hexes, but players also have to consider filling up their board as much as possible.

I have a personal bias towards scribbling stuff on dry-erase boards, so I find Träxx satisfying for that shallow reason alone. However, as the game relies on the same set of cards in every round as opposed to fickle dice rolls, there isn't a high amount of replay value here. Also, beware the temptation of peeking at the direction of your opponents' paths before drawing your own.

tl;dr: [thing=131260][/thing] meets [thing=157][/thing]... or something

This game combines the crayon thing from well known crayon rail games with the dice rolling of Qwixx. But since enveryone has a different starting position, no one can copy anyone. Draw lines, score points and try not to leave empty spots. Fun enough, but I would say Qwixx is more fun if you're looking for this kind of game

Nowhere as fun as Qwixx. Traxx promises player interaction as you race to reach numbers first, but - in reality - the separate player boards mean it's a multiplayer solitaire puzzle like Take It Easy.

The small selection of cards don't have the same race/gambling excitement as dice either.

An ok filler, but a bit meh. I prefer Qwixx.

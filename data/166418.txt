Fantastic.  Very fun, easy to learn, but with enough depth to have real staying power.  The physical components are very high quality.

It's a dice rolling game masquerading as a worker placement game.  As such, it's entirely possible to make no mistakes and just get completely hosed by bad dice rolls - as I found out the hard way.  Thankfully it's short enough that it's not annoying when that happens.  I'd play it again, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get a copy for myself...

Backed this game on KS, the fulfillment was a few months late but that is the risk taken in kickstarter so no big deal. My first play thru the game the other 2 players decided after the first round that they hated the game. Basically the theme of the game is mining an asteroid using drill rigs represent by value of dice rolls and worker placed at certain placements,  selling the resources for money, after 3 of the resource spots are depleted the game ends, whoever has the most money wins. 
The rounds are:  
1- roll two dice for everyone's use, 
2- assign your workers (without knowing what your own dice values are going to be) to collect and sell resources/ manipulate dice rolls and workers/ change player order,.
3- roll 1 die for everyone to use and manipulate, 
4- roll your own die ( can get up to two more dice as your score increases).
5- resolve your workers. 
So the problem the other 2 players had that made them hate the game was the way each player has to assign their workers before they know what value their own dice are going to be. There did not seem to be enough options to migrate the player dice roll to cut down good/bad luck ratio.
I may have missed some dynamic of the game mechanics, I will play around with the game on my own and will raise my rating later if I am wrong.

I thought Builders of Blankenburg to be the most unforgiving game in my collection. But this is something else. Fun, witty, tense. The theme is present at every step. You really can feel it. I like this a lot. I will probably rise the rating in future

Very clever game. You have an idea what you can mine each turn because of the Standard Mining Dice. Then you place your workers in locations to mine or mitigate the luck of the dice. Roll the neutronium die and resolve your workers in any order. Mine resources to export them for money to win the game. Also comes with several variants to keep the game fresh and interesting.

Pretty good game. I like the base competitive game most (without corporate sponsors and research) - it has a good mix of options for a worker placement game. The custom meeples for solar, lock and money were great. I liked the various ores as well - well-differentiated.

Some things that could be improved: the manual is vague at times, would have liked numbers all around the track instead of every five, a slightly bigger board with more indicators of what the Captain's abilities were on the different spots would have been helpful, the individual player boards need more contrast on the individual cargo/crew slots (and cargo slots should be bigger).

1 play so far.  Jury still out.  With limited workers it is hard to mitigate bad rolls, so can be luck dependent.  Not helped by runaway leader effect (if you have more points, you get more dice to roll, so first to get to 10 has a distinct advantage)

This medium-weight scifi game works okay for what it sets out to do. For me, it doesn't differentiate itself in any way to earn a place in my collection, although I'd probably be up to try it out again.

Pretty mediocre worker placement with probably too much reliance on luck.  Would have to play again to see if my opinion changes... But right now,  it's a meh from me.

After a 2nd play, I liked it much better. Raising my score from 6 to a 7.

5 player is out of the question.
4 player is over too fast
2 player there's not enough tension.

Not sure what to think of this one... On the whole it's a good game but I think it needs more resources and for them to be based on the number of players.

Backed on Kickstarter. Very well rounded game in my opinion. There is a sort of "luck" element to the game, but its all variable by what you assign your workers to. The mini-expansions from KS were awesome, can't imagine playing without them. Even though my wife kicks my butt at this game every time, I'm always anxious to play this game over and over. Overall, right now it's one of my top - mid/short length worker placement games.

Ameri-trash worker placement with space miners competing to extract common and rare ore from an asteroid belt. Harvesters combine dice energy from the belt with their own to complete their actions. The new twist of this game involves using extra miner workers on action spots BEFORE their own dice roll to manipulate the result. Other actions are the basic stuff of selling ore, filling contracts, getting first player, and diplomatically sharing an asteroid mining space. Chaos follows when a player chooses to export ore and invites unwanted mayhem from space pirates.

Not bad of a game, just feels slightly boring. Still it is one of the more nasty worker placements, so if that's your cup of tea you might want to check it out. Otherwise there are better games out like Alien Frontiers and Roll for the Galaxy

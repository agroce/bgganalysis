RATING: 5
Played a 5 player game for the first time, everyone but me had at least played once, which took 4+ hours. I think it's a soundly designed game, but I think it might kill Ameritrashy FFG games for me. 

I played with blue which seems really underpowered, and because of a fluky event card deck, placing corruption was very, very difficult for 90% of the game. On the other hand, red seems to be very overpowered, and eventually won by leveling up. I didn't feel like I was in control, or in competition, for almost the entire game. My choices were limited, and didn't provide me much benefit that I could see. I don't find the theme or artwork very appealing either. 

The components are nice, but I can't really think of much during my four hours of playing that was anything but frustrating and unpleasant. I had initially said I would try it again some day, but after sleeping on it that is doubtful. We'll see.

RATING: 8.5
I have a feeling Amerithrashers will consider this a Euro and Eurogamers will consider this Amerithrashy! Bit of a hybrid what with the dice-chucking but I'm leaning towards Euro due to the heavy resource management and area control elements. Cracking game, always a tense buildup to an exciting end. Shame it's basically a 4p only game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun combination of ameritrash dice combat and euro-style area control.  I have concerns about balance between the factions, but I think that with experienced players the balance is less of an issue.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Terrible theme, terrible artwork (the subject matter and the visual components are simply disgusting) with insipid dice-driven mechanics to round off the unpleasant experience and that's how I rate a game a 2.

At the moment this is my favourite boardgame, for many reasons:
1) very strong asimmetry: each faction plays very differently from the others (different cards, same type of units, but each one with different characteristics and upgrades, very different strategies, some are more geared toward certain winning conditions than the other, but a good player may win in more than one way).
2) depending on the setup, each player can go for one of the 2 winning conditions (or even both). The only exception is nurgle, which looks like he can win much more easily by points than by dial advancement. This results in games which can be much different from each other.
3) the theme is very strong and well integrated: each god has cards and upgrades that fit very well into their role in the warhammer universe.
4) even though some gods (I'm looking at you, khorne) look particularly strong in the beginning, each game I played was very tense, and at least 2 players were almost tied for the win.
5) There is dice combat, but it isn't too much random (there's usually a 50% chance of success), and khorne is the only one who actively looks for a lot of fights.

There are also a couple of negative aspect:
1) a decent knowledge of the behaviour of the gods is required to play in the best way. I've found games with some new players to be quite balanced, but if there is a single experienced player he will win.
2) in one game, i was playing khorne and had a lot of very bad luck witch dice in the first half of the game, resulting in no dial advancement  (and no points) in the first three rounds, effectively cutting me out of the game.  Don't be too scared, since I was playing with an experienced player and he told me something like that never happened to him.

I think this is a better game than Blood Rage.  The area control actually means something and the unique factions are quite interesting.  Even though I'm not a huge fan of dice rolling without luck mitigation, I didn't mind it much in this game.  Highly recommended.

Note: The board is atrocious and makes it hard to see the corruption pieces.

I really do appreciate the asymmetrical sides in the game and it has some interesting takes on area control. But the theme is very off-putting to me. It's too gross really - the game board, the player representations, the concept of the game. Not for me.

Have played countless rounds of this - probably more than any other game I've played - and I love it. Particularly good when you play it regularly with the same group of players, and definitely best with the full four (or five with the "Horned Rat" expansion).

This one seemed fun when we started it up, but it has ended up seeing very little play at my table as time as gone on.  It seems like it might require a bit of dedication from players to learn to play effectively, since Khorn appears to just rock everybody when everyone is new at the game.

Assymettrical, fantasy area control game, I don't know why I ever played it to be honest, not my cup of hot chocolate at all. Seemed overly scripted in that everyone needed to play a particular way to prevent another race running away with their race power (another race can usually each hold back another)

RATING: 9
Chaos in the Old World is another hybrid game combining area control mechanics with asymmetrical race balances and dice-rolling.
The game really shines in its fair amount of time, it can be played and a game mechanism which nearly guarantees tense games and photo finishes every play.
The one and really con is that its pretty much restricted to 4 players, because all different gods are pretty much needed to keep the game balance and leaving one god out, will favor the one or the other remaining.
The game wont get boring after a lot of plays, which is another proof for well developed games.

RATING: 8.25
Rated 8 based on first play. My initial thoughts: this is great and will probably upgrade rating in future. I see a lot of potential here... Plus we played with 2 players only (each controlled two gods) and I imagine it will be way more awesome with 4 (will see abt that this weekend)!

Upgraded to 9. Really like this one. Great theme. Lots of intricacies to keep track of. While some people find the theme too dark - playing on a map of human skin, corrupting the world, etc - I played this with my parents and they had a blast. They didn't even notice that the map was 'human skin' and thought it was a really cool game. I guess it depends on how deep you personally immerse yourself into the theme.

I really like games with asymmetrical play. This game is fairly easy to get someone new playing. Strategy and the indepth rules can be taught along the way.

RATING: 7
It is an area control/influence game based in the Warhammer universe. You control one of four faction and compete to fulfill different objectives. Every turn you corrupt the landscape, dominating its inhabitants, and battle with the depraved followers of rival gods. Each god has a unique deck of gifts and abilities, and can upgrade their followers into deadly foes. Summon forth living manifestations of Chaos, debased and hidden cultists, and the horrifying greater daemons - beings capable of destroying near everything in their path. You have multiple ways of winning the. The downside however is that it plays well only with four players, otherwise it becomes unbalanced. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I finally got a chance to play this game, and I really liked it. I can see why you have to have 4 to play, but this game left me wanting more. I'm excited to try it again with my regular group.

What I really liked about this was that each player is seeking victory in a different way, and those different paths look to be very balanced. The game itself is an area control game mostly, with randomized setup and events throughout the game. On top of the mostly Euro underpinnings, FFG has layered a ton of theme, and some ameritrash elements. 

I'd put this game into the same category as Dungeon Petz as a Euro/Ameri hybrid, with elements of both.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I enjoyed this game, all the different aspects of the different races and the way you play the cards, summoning and everything, the only thing I didn't like at all was the fact that not all units are worth playing, some races don't never play their gods 'cause it is not worth it.

RATING: 5
A reasonable strategy game with some fighting. The different types of power reflect the 4 factions well. Theme wise is cool. 

But if you look beyond that miniature, you might feel the game is unbalanced and very dependent on card draw. A player could be easily eliminated within the first few turns. 

May seem right if that happens, but for a euro-themed game, than that's not too good. 

Other than that, it's just an area-card-battle game that does not titillate me much. (don't get me wrong, I love WH40K. I have 15 armies!) but this game just did not make it for me. It just felt like a weak war-ish game. Did not satify me when we finish the game.

After a few years, we dig this out for another run. It's still not what I would have liked. The game play is still pretty good but.......it's a straight average game indeed.

RATING: 6
Suffers from a few optimal plays in early turn figure placement and optimal upgrade cards. 

The dice honestly seem like they really don't fit this game at all. Everything else is so exacting and then you throw a very random wrench in the gears. The buckets of dice system is awfully random. Combined with Khorne's dial being one kill per territory you can easily get one dial advancement counter one turn and five the next with the exact same setup. Or you can get six kills in one territory on two dice (yes, I've had this happen several times). It's just wacky. 

In a theoretical second edition I'd like combat to be a different system. I'd love this game to be diceless but it would require a separate combat deck or something with major reworkings. 

update: I think I've come to terms with the dice but I'm still not fond of the exploding on 6s thing as it can get kind of swingy. I like the threat of more kills than the number of dice because it keeps the planning from getting too finely tuned, but I would like it better  if it were limited in some way. 

probably final update, as I haven't played in years: Chaos seemed brilliant when I was first starting to get into boardgaming as a serious hobby. It showed me the light. I still love the theme but my opinion has dropped from great to merely good and my enthusiasm for play has diminished accordingly. If someone wanted to play Chaos I would do so, though I would rather not play Khorne since so many of his decisions are rote. As it stands I would not request a play except perhaps in a rare fit of nostalgia. I have too many games with the same amount of interaction but with less rough edges and balance issues. Plus, I have a friend with a small stack of COIN games which fill an identical niche.

I have a problem with any game that overwhelms a new player, and then, after the new player checks out and is only doing a half-assed effort, manages to win the game. Fair enough, the other players didn't see me as a threat, and I was at the very bottom of the scoring track for all but the first turn or two, but I should have done no better than a third place.

RATING: 7
Excellent RPG style game. Played with 4 players, everyone had a different playing experience - very enjoyable overall. We did have an long discussion about the end game conditions, and decided that Check the End Game sub-phase is the only time where we evaluate whether the game is over or not. We did discuss this point extensively, however, since the "anytime" word in the rulebook threw us off. 

If it comes down to a 4 player game to play, I think it'll come to this one (due to rarity of 4 player game nights). If we have our usual 5+ players, I think we'll be looking at Small World (for a shorter game when we want to play multiple games in one day) or Shogun (for those marathon, one game days).

RATING: 9
Rated after three repeated plays. I usually never feel that I have to replay a game when I finish one session, but this was amazing. First play you get to know the roles, second play you tried a strategy that failed miserably, but it would have worked if only... So you have to play just one more time, but this time you try another God with different strategy, and someone else is doing something you never would have though of with your former God... It just goes on. 

I like the mix of euro worker-placement and ameritrash dice-slaughter. Its both and neither.

Maybe it will grow old in the end, but this game also feels very balanced. If I do not discover a radical strategy that ruins this balance, I look forward to many sessions of CitOW.

Note: I knew nothing of the Warhammer universe before buying the game, two of the people in my group did. I did not feel it was an issue for me, the game stand very well on its own.

I do not like the art of Chaos. It turned me off from the game for awhile because it's just a little bit too over the top with its dark fantasy theme. But Chaos really does have some fascinating gameplay. I like the asymmetrical factions a lot. They have such different goals and abilities to struggle for victory. I'm okay with the design philosophy of if they're all equally broken, then they're equally balanced. 

But some races do seem strictly stronger and weaker (red faction is just annoying how much they will stomp rookie players by sheer force of exploding sixes and silliness). Chaos is a rough, darkly themed game that I can't really recommend very widely. But I still find the dynamic of the unique factions to be very neat.

3-5(4,5)

It's solid. Nice area control mechanics and very interesting player powers and scoring objectives. Issues for me are that, yes, Khorne can be a bit intimidating, but his play is sort of boringly straight-forward not much thinking going on. Additionally, the other players can often just sort of try to claim their nooks (with their relevant tokens and such) and the only interaction is avoiding Khorne. I'm certain, though, that after some plays it will become obvious that you'll need to start crippling other (non-Khorne) players. As it was, I've played Khorne and thought it was frustratingly boring because it was pretty obvious what I needed to do to win and subsequently players made the "obvious" moves of going out of their way to give me nothing to attack. Also, it is important to know all the decks and I can see how some would prefer having a community action deck to pull from (for balance reasons).

Fantasy Flight has always produced strongly thematic games.  With Chaos in the Old World they have at last managed to do this without encumbering the game with a mass of cards, chits and special rules. You'll play to a finish in a reasonable time too.

At heart Chaos... is simply an area control game with a touch of Risk-esque combat.  Its cleverness lies in the distinctive powers and goals given to each of the Chaos Gods contesting the game.  Each plays very differently and yet the game feels well balanced.  Add to this a different selection of Old World (event) cards every game and there's a good degree of variability.

While the artwork is suitably thematic, the borders between areas can be difficult to see and some areas are just too small.  Production quality is up to the usual FFG standards.  The rulebook is the usual FFG verbose.  Do yourself a favour and download Universal Head's excellent summary, in which he fits into two pages what sprawls over 25 in the FFG booklet.

RATING: 8
Nicely balanced area control game. The four factions play vastly different. Neat combat system. One of the best area control games that I have ever played. A pity though that it only plays with exactly 4 players. The dark theme will not appeal to everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Area control game with very asymmetric powers, great mechanisms, lots of potential in this game (if you don't mind the theme), but...

First play, Khorne seemed massively overpowered, or at least, it wasn't obvious until too late how to counter him. Didn't make for a terribly satisfactory first play. On future plays, is it all about how well the other three players together prevent Khorne's double-dial-advancement win? Not sure if that's the most fun game dynamic. Will a new player (and there's basically always at least one, usually more, new players in the groups I play in) usually hand the game to Khorne?

When I finished my first play I wasn't sure how keen I was to play again, but actually now I feel I want to play again to see how viable stopping Khorne is when you go into it with your eyes open. Provisional rating a 7, but this could definitely go up or down.

Interesting assymetrical game of conflict - mixed with wellknown euro games mechanisms.

I understand why people love or hate the game. Although I am not attracted by his other designs, I believe that Eric Lang blew the competition out of the water with this. Not for every palate. This game has a well defined storyline and players have to struggle to push the events in their direction to be the winner. You know that Khorne is going to win if left unchecked. You know Nurgle is going to dominate. Slaanesh will probably try to root in a noble rich region and tick those precious dials. Tzeetch will outmanouver you. Small decisions will tip the scale and your ability to react to them will decide whether you're going to survive or not. Not for fans of "best move" or optimisation games.

A game that is somehow so much more than it should be at a glance.  I think CitOW's biggest draw for me is the incredibly effective and balanced a-symmetry the game is built upon.  The components are high quality (as usual for FFG, this excludes the cardboard chits, which are woefully inadequate) and the miniatures are very receptive to the hot water trick.
I have played with the Horned Rat expansion, but find a 5th player does little to improve upon the game.  Presently, will be sticking to just the base.

[Updated March 2012] 
I have begun painting the miniatures for this beloved game.  May also consider replacing the corruption chits with wooden tokens.

[Updated June 2012]
I have ordered a complete replacement for the influence tokens in the form of laser-etched 3/4" disks with the chaos star etched into them.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
First of all, this wasn't a game on my wishlist at all, i just found a very good deal and gave it a try. Do I regret it? Defenitely not. I played this game a few times now and can really say that it is pretty intuitive and a nice hybrid between the classical Area of Control mixed with Euro Elements. What stands out for me is the high player interaction across the board and the different playstyles depending on the chaos god you get. Another thing which is phenomenal is the variety of winning the game. Every single path seems to work (sure some fractions have an easier times winning on certain paths).
Even if Chaos in the old world is a great game, i have to mention some slight cons about this game. 
First of all, you really need the full playercount (4) to play this game correctly. The design pretty much makes this a must, because of upcoming balancing issues if not played with this count. Second: The picking of upgrade cards seems a bit scripted to me, because most of the time there is really 1 card strictly better than the other. Third and this is not really a con, but from my point of view the most important factor of making this game really good. You need a Gaming Group, which really has the ability to keep track of the game and adapt accoridingly, while not overly adapting and completely crushing the leader. Chaos is so dependand on an ingame self-balancing mechanism, that the game can be screwed if someone heaviley messes up. Overall this is a great game and can be often played because of its lower playtime (1-2 hours). Another thing to mention, the game doesnt come down to only skill in the end. The final result is more dependand on the gaming group (the meta) itself, then just pure right decisions in the end. So if you are on the high end of competitive play, this might be a con for you. Overall i can see this Game easily rated between 5 and 10 depending on the gaming group. Luckily i have a very passionated Group where most decisions are rationally based so for me its between the 8-10 range.
I'd highly recommend it.

Fantastic design that gets 3 of my favorite gameplay features right: interesting asymmetry, area control, and dice-to-shoot.

Highly recommended.

Rated this a lead-off 8 with a bullet, despite the fact that we weren't taught that clicks had a max of two per turn AND played with the misprinted player aid rules as-is.  I have minor misgivings about the region clarity on the map, but the production on this really impressed me - and I'm not even a fan of plastic.  I've played every race and enjoyed every game.  I wish there were more effective ways to stop Khorne when they're ahead, and have had some anti-climactic finishes due to inevitable dial victories.  Tzeentch also seems most reliant on the Old World events to compete, and many of the game's strategic choices seem scripted.  Still a great game in my book, happy to play it just about any time.

Chaos is a unique game, neat combination of euro style with ameri flavour.

RATING: 9.75
The love-child of Euro and AT, and managed to inherit all the best traits of both!  Solid area control/action point mechanics make this a strategic game, but when combined with asymmetric (and balanced!) powers, direct conflict, and even a little bit of role-play (with the dials), it makes for a very fresh experience that I enjoy even when I lose.  Also stands as a fantastic example of theme-to-mechanics continuity, even if the theme is a bit objectionable at best.

My only complaints are, as I mentioned, the theme (I still squirm when someone plays Rain of Pus...yuck), and the 4-player only dilemma.  Other than that, pure genius!

Edit - Now with Horned Rat!  Takes the delicate balance of finely tuned 4-player world destruction and impressively transforms that into finely tuned 5-player world destruction.  What more could you want!?

RATING: 6.5
The details around the design of this game are fascinating to me.  Love the asymmetric nature of the player 'gods'.  Like how the game play reflects the different gods and their methods / objectives.  Play is straight forward enough to introduce to newer players and the quality of the game pieces is top notch. My nick on the design of the game is that I am not sure that each god has multiple paths to victory.  It is entirely likely that each player has to follow a prescribed course tactic - and if one doesn't it might not cost just them the game, but might throw off another player as well - setting up a third for the win simply because the 2nd couldn't survive.  This makes the game have a real sense of 'controlled chaos'  and given the game's name - perhaps that is the desired state.  Good game, but it might frustrate some.

Fun game with area influence mechanics and asymmetry amongst the different gods. Good theme and an entertaining twist on familiar mechanics.

Having said that, it seems far easier to win as either Korn or Nurgel, partly because the strategies for those two are more straightforward. I'm not quite sure how to play the other two.

Will have to play again sometime to see if I can rate this one higher.

Let me say: The ONLY reason this game doesn't get a full 10 is the cultist minis. The flags bend far too easily. That's the only complaint I can have regarding this game.

When I've explained this game (to two different groups now) I've begun like this: "So, basically this game is 3 against whoever is currently in the lead. There is no reason to pretend like it's anything different."

Over the course of four plays, I've seen Khorne win once, Tzeentch win twice, and Nurgle win once. I'm waiting for that magic Slaanesh win to show me that it's all nice and round, but I'm confident that Slaanesh can do it.

RATING: 6
The release of Blood Rage has helped me identify the elements that are problematic for me when it comes to this game - area majority just isn't that interesting for me as a primary mechanism. BR makes it worse by introducing too much unpredictability into player powers, and in that respect, this is the better game. The problem is just that for me, if you're going wear the trappings of a war game, it should emphasise winning the battle on the ground and not just executing your race's abilities the most efficiently. This ends up a multiplayer chip taking game more often than not.

A well crafted area control game with a great theme.  El Grande with tentacles.  I like how each player will have the opportunity to explore unique strategies based on the role they assume (Much like Here I Stand in this respect).

A tight and clear rule set combined with short playing times means that this game can hit the table often and a appeal to a broad range of gamers.

Chaos In the Old World doens't seem to present anything particularly new, but it still feels like a fresh approach to some tried and true game mechanics.

Ultimately this is a fun game, but I'd rather play El Grande.  Not because Chaos In The Old World is bad, but becuase El Grande is just so good.

Asymmetric "dudes on a map" in the Warhammer universe. Nothing particularly wrong with it, then again nothing particularly exciting either. Just doesn't stroke my baloney with any vigor.  1 AP player can turn a 90 min game into a 3 hr slog. It's barely tolerable at 90 min and agony beyond that. If I were stuck with it, I'd probably end up liking it once fully explored. Faint praise.

Egyszerű szabályok, viszonylag  rövid pörgős játék (2 óra max), teljesen különböző fajok, többféle játékvége feltétel. A korong forgatása nagyon ötletes kiegyenlítő mechanizmus (az erősorrend folyamatosan változik), és ezen keresztül a fajok is egyedibbek (máskor jutnak bizonyos dolgokhoz). Nekem egyedül az volt fura, hogy megfelelő kártya híján a parasztoknak végig semmilyen szerep nem jutott. Bizonyos kártyák esetén fontosak lehetnek, de ez nagyon lutri. Összességében egy kifejezetten jó játéknak tűnt, bár a téma nekem olyan semmilyen volt, meg komor is az egész, tehát valahol fura, hogy ennyire felértékelik a játékot, de a rövidsége mindenképp kiemeli a többi hasonló kaliberű amerikai közül.

Played half a dozen times. An enjoyable, Risk-esque game of board control and conquest in the Warhammer fantasy universe. The theme of the game is very strong, and the demon playing pieces and game board are of excellent quality and design.

A game takes about two hours with four players, and the end can actually come quite quickly once the majority of the players demons and influence tokens are out on the map. It's enjoyable, but I don't love it, in fact my gaming group seems to like it quite a bit more than I do.

now, I dislike AT quite a lot, but still I was surprised how much worse this game seemed than starcraft or even the underveloped conan. 

seeing how FFG can't decide how powerful the factions are, and the swing is HUGE one way or the other, it's not easy to believe the game was meant to be at all balanced. 

(the balance issue isn't really that important in a game like this, but the fact that some races are much more fun to play than others is a much bigger problem in my mind)

(probably it didn't help my enjoyment that I know 0 about the setting the game's in. everyone insisted on calling other players strange names while to me they remained blue green red and violet)

RATING: 9
The best asymmetrical area control game where players have to balance/cancel/neuter each other in hopes of trying to steal a victory at the end.  The theme is perfect for this game as this game requires you to be nasty to one another.  This game doesn't have King making per say.  I would consider it as players need to police each other if they are to have a chance of winning.  The play time is perfect as the game is deep enough to command your attention the entire time without overstaying it's welcome.  Downtime is not an issue as well, which is remarkable considering the complexity of the game.  While the game feels complex, it feels entirely simple at the same time.  The only draw back to this game is that it should be played at max player count.  If the game was more flexible with the player count it would be 10 for sure.

I really want to play more of this game.  The best way to play it for me would be to actually plan to play several games in sequence over a couple weeks.  I really want to get the full feel of it.

Last time we played it was a quick "hey lets play this" decision and the game went poorly since we were all just re-learning the rules again.

Don't care for the Warhammer universe at all. Game does have euro style mechanics, I thought it was enjoyable. Purple won all three games due to shortest dial victory path and extra body to acolytes with first upgrade. Possibly unbalanced.

I waited for this very eagerly but luckily got to play at a convention before buying. So in the two times I've played I learned that this might not be the best thing for me and my group. And so decided not to buy this. However, I would still like to get a few more plays to be able to better form an opinion and rate this.

Another great contender for the 4-player spot.

Great theme, great art, cool minis. I don't know much about Warhammer, so I can't judge the accuracy to the base material, but the result is surely fantastic.

If any god doesn't go all-in (Khorne not attacking, someone turtling without gaining DCAs...) the game gets slightly unbalanced, though, as all players should be stopping each other. That means a 3-player game is not as great as a 4-player one, but it's still good

This was a gift from my 2010 iternational Secret Santa.

I like the sheer amount of asymetry in this game. four powers with four very different ways to play the seems to perfectly encompass the Chaos Gods from the Warhammer mythos.

The game play is fairly sharp with little downtime and the game doesn't seem to labour on.

Be a demon lord and turn the landscape into an unending hellscape of pain and suffering, for fun and profit! Chaos in the Old World is assymetrical, it's tight, it is full of deep strategy and it rewards multiple plays. If playing cards like "Rain of Pus" on your opponents makes you a bit squeamish, this might not be for you, but if you can get into the idea of spreading your unique demon's foul stench of corruption across the land, this is a great game.

Area influence the ameritrash way! Very good medium level game. There is a lot of combat but the game is mostly about manoeuvering your demons around the board trying to use your powers to their maximum ability to gain dominance in the different regions. This will give you points and point can win you the game. Where this game really shines is the other way you win the game. Each player has a threat dial which if it is advanced enough times also wins you the game. The gods you can play are totally different which makes them fun to play out against each other. Downside is that most gods seem designed for a single strategy and cannot be played any other way. Game is quick, fluent and a lot of fun. (if you find destroying the world funny that is) Components are generally good but the miniatures are very breakable (again).

A brilliant, deep, thematic, and strategic game.  there is so much going on here that, even after many playthroughs, I feel like there's still more I need to learn.  The only thing keeping me from scoring this a ten is how it only really plays well with four players.  If you can't get exactly four people together, you might as well play something else.

For me, Chaos hits all the right spots.  It's asymmetric, has multiple paths to victory, is highly thematic and it lasts just the right amount of time and has just the right amount of conflict and diplomacy.  Fighting is useful, but it's not the path to victory (unless you're Khorne), so it avoids issues of player elimination or beating up a weak player - in fact, you want to avoid beating up a weak player since you'd rather weaken someone else's position.  Finally, if one of your guys dies, it's not good, but it doesn't really cause you to fall behind since you have a limited pool of minions to summon from.

I'm taking a point off because of the poor map design though.  Combined with the piles of corruption tokens that you have to place, it makes for a very crowded map!

Pro's:

1) Entirely biased but as a big fan of warhammer fantasy and my main army being chaos deamons it isn't exactly surprising that  I think the theme is amazing.
2) Multiple winning conditions and asymmetry of the powers provides extra variety, then add the upgrades + the way the spells interact with each god and you have consistently shifting chaos that pretty much drips theme.
3) I love the simplicity of the miniatures as well as the aesthetics of the spell cards, corruption tokens and the board itself.
4) While the game is competitive there is also a ticking clock that forces the players not to damage each other's plans entirely as otherwise the board wins, I seriously love these types of mechanics in games.

Con's:

1) Pretty much exclusively balanced for 4 players, each god balances out another god and so it is pretty much unplayable otherwise. Seriously, do not play the game at anything less than 4.
2) Game can be punishing if one of the players does not play their role correctly in balancing their counterpart god. This means you can have an issue where one players is simply able to dominate the game easily (Seriously, this is more punishing than the COIN games as at least those are long enough that screwing up an individual turn wont necessarily lose you the game). Chaos on the other hand could easily make it so you have no chance of winning the game at all.

RATING: 9
I like games with variable character powers. All the characters in this game really fit together like a puzzle, and it's interesting to see how they interact. Downsides: the map regions are poorly defined, and combat is not much of an option unless you are Khorne. I hope the second problem at least will be addressed in the expansion.

RATING: 9
I’m still undecided about Chaos in the Old World: thematically it’s very rich, which is one of the very few things I really enjoy in a game; as far as playing it goes though it turns out as an area-control game that doesn’t play any different from your typical dry and unthematic euro.

And this is what makes me mistrust this otherwise excellent game: it actually feels like an euro in disguise, which means you can surely mess with the other players if you wish, like any good game requires, but in the end it’s the point-grinding only what really counts, thus the less you cross your opponents’ path the most points you collect and the closer to winning you get.

In other words, Chaos in the Old World still doesn’t feel chaotic enough to claim its pretentious title. [i](January 2013)[/i]

[b]Update[b] - Since only one of my gaming buddies owns Chaos in the Old World, I haven’t had many chances at playing it recently but I’ve had time aplenty to brood over it and change my mind: it’s more of a hybrid game than an euro, since so many things can get out of control as soon as you run out of luck with dice rolls or card draws; moreover, the different focus and abilities of the four gods make for plenty of randomness and different paths to victory.

Ultimately I feel Chaos fully belongs to the hybrid games like Cyclades, among which it shines: hence during my Fall 2015 rating revise not only raised I my rating from 7,5 to 9 but Chaos also convinced me it’s chaotic enough to fully deserve its title.

Some games flirt with perfection.  CitOW is one such game.  The perfect blend of Ameritrash and Euro ideologies.  Each Chaos God plays differently and it's a blast trying to figure out the best way to exploit your differences.  Great artwork, reasonable playing time.  This is one of the all time greats.

Like the asymmetry of the player powers but a little concerned about replayability, with only 3-4 players and the same suite of powers each time I suspect it will develop a strong scripted feel. Time will tell...
Map once again a triumph of art over function, hard to read the board and several very indistinct regional boundaries. When will game board designers realise that gameplay should take priority over appearance.

One of my favorites that I currently own, in the group I play with, it can become relatively cut-throat and sometimes will get aggressive with each other, but I love playing this when it does hit the table.  No real complaints, but I would really recommend playing with at least 4, and someone has to use Khorn for "crowd control", or there really isn't any difficulty to the game.

Meh.  It wasn't bad and I could be talked into playing again, but the theme doesn't do much for me at all.  I also didn't care for the asymetrical sides.  I don't care for games like that where you would have to play numerous times on each side to understand.  a turn off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An area control game that adds plenty of theme to the genre and introducing some dice-based conflict which is unusual for the genre. The four Chaos powers all play very differently and exactly as one would hope. There's plenty of opportunity for mischief, backstabbing, and general, well, chaos. Theme might be a turnoff to those who don't go for the whole "evil gods desecrating the world" motif.

Asymmetric dudes on map game with area control elements. Rules are easy and straight forward but it requires some games to be able to play it fully. Some gods are easier than other which makes it uneven for beginners. After some plays game seams balanced. Khorn changes the game drastically and adds more randomness due to the increased amount of combats. I'm not saying it's bad just the game with and without Khorn is totally different. 

Horn rat expansion is fun but I found event cards to be a bit imbalanced (they worn about them being more drastic and when it is more drastic for you and not others it makes the game less fun for me).

RATING: 5.5
An area control and variable player power game with too many options for my brain to process when deciding how to spend action points... mostly because it is pretty easy for your opponents to nullify your plays (thus it is very tactical and somewhat chaotic).  It is a game of efficiency and choosing your battles wisely.  The game is a bit fiddly but seems to come together nicely if you don't have excessively slow players (like me).  Six cultists per player felt like it was not enough, but this is probably by design and is probably a result of my inexperience with the subtleties of the game.

RATING: 7.8
Ah! The old Warhammer chaos gods. Blood for the blood god! Didn't they make some heavy metal record with that as the title once?

Anyway, here we are, 4 gods, 3 ways to win the game. Different gods are better at different paths to victory, but you have to play the game a bit to work that out. F'rinstance, my old mate Khorne should never be at the front of the VP race, he shouldn't be ruining regions, he should be killing everyone else who's trying to end the game that way and ensuring he ends it by getting two turns on his dial every round. 

This game has some depth, lots of cards for each god, lots of other cards and tokens, so the game should have a good few runs through before it gets tired. One to play again.

Even though I won with the red dudes by killing as many weenies as I could and earning two bumps on the wheel nearly every turn, I am really not an Ameritrasher and this one just REEKS of Ameritrash!  I had a HAND FULL of cards that made my head spin... and dominating a region is totally seperate from corrupting a region... and the lines that show what areas of the map are connected to other areas of the map were hard to decode... and all the tokens and cards and units and dice on the board!!!  I'm glad it didn't last as long as a typical Ameritrasher.

But I definitely did have fun with good friends playing it... and I would definitely play it again with them if they really wanted to

RATING: 9
This is an outstanding game. The mechanics that are combined actually combine to create a game engine which works cohesively. Each decision is meaningful; each moment is tense. Most importantly, each side plays and feels differently; playing with the god's personality actually makes sense strategically. The theme is the opposite of pasted on with this game as it is, in fact, integrated into the play of the game. I know nothing about the Warhammer universe but didn't need to to rate this game a ten.

Update: I still keep the game at a nine, but I don't get it to the table as much I'd like. It seems to me that what I like about the game - the asymmetry of the different factions is actually improved upon so strikingly by Cthulhu Wars. Khorne seems to stand as playing one way while the other gods are variations on dropping corruption. Their card play options differ but their overall goals remain pretty symmetrical. It's still an outstanding game and one of my all time favorites, but Cthulhu Wars does asymmetry so much more boldly that it has made me aware of some missed opportunities in CitOW.

Four asymmetrical powers, area control, strong themeing and unabashed face-mashing-direct-player-adversarial game play.  I love it!!  DO NOT play this with people that get pissed with direct confrontation and in-your-face gameplay.  

The more I play this game, the more I love it.  The powers are very different, and each game plays out differently than any of the other ones.  As we get more experience the game continues to change and players start doing unexpected things.  I love, love, LOVE this game!  It truly is a unique mix of mechanics and works so very well on many levels.  A classic and a game I can see hitting the table many, many more times.

I've been trying to figure out the allure of this game.  I believe that one of the things that I like about it is that when playing with the same group of players the game really evolves.  It's difficult to go into the game with a specific winning tactics in mind (well, the Khorne player tends to have the same strategy, but the tactical approach must be different) and actually play those tactics and win.  The randomness of the old world cards and the initial token placement has a lot to do with the actions of the players.  Since the game actively encourages the players to foil each others plans whenever possible, it really fosters a competitiveness that many games are unable to.  Tack on an interesting and over-the-top theme with solid mechanics and you have a classic game!

I enjoyed it a lot. It was quick, offered interesting tactical options and great interaction. Two people were out of the title race early, that's certainly a problem.

The card play is CitoW's weakest part, because you can play them everywhere and some cards can really screw a player, for example I as Slaneesh was disallowed to place corruption three times in a row by Khorne cards, which killed me in the end and I could do nothing about it (well I should have expected it probably and tried to play around it)

Good game, but in the end it came down to Khorne kingmaking. It was between myself (Nurgle) and Tzeetch on who won. Nurgle from Victory points (ended with 66 points) and Tzeetch from dial advancement. He chose not to kill a cultist of Tzeetch's and give him a double dial advancement where he would have only gotten a single dial advancement had Khorne killed off his cultist. I misplayed a couple things with it being my first game and the ending was sour but it was still a fairly good game overall.

Risk variant set in one of GW's many Warhammerish universes. Four distinct factions of demi-gods screw with poor mankind each in their own unique way. Assymetrical game in the ways the factions play and can score quick victories, but maybe not quite assymetric enough?

Colorful and reasonably thematic but unlikely to make to the top of any lists for me. Even after only one play the game started to feel somewhat repetitive. I'd like to play a couple more times before I write it off - maybe I was not in the right frame of mind?

RATING: 7
Provisional rating, after 1 and an aborted play ... thought I'd like this, didn't :(

I think my expectations were way off what this game is, and that's probably the root of the problem. I was expecting a game with battling gods, powers being launched and mayhem. And got instead a euro engine with a huge gob of chaos (appropriate for the name, maybe, but I didn't like it) from player actions.

Weirdly I found it a pretty dull game that annoyed me while playing! That's odd because usually a dull game I just want it over and have no interest or 'investment' in the game - which makes me think maybe I'm being too harsh on it and should give it another try (hence the 4 rather than the 3 rating).

It's a euro at its heart, it could easily have been an economic game with cubes etc instead of plastic minis and a 'war' theme.

Combat is pretty dull, no 'tactics' other than roll 6's ... at least it's fairly quick.

What annoyed me, each turn you just optimise your actions, there's not much in the way of borders, everything is free-form. Events bring chaos, you might get stuff to help you might not. Player actions bring chaos, plenty of options for random screwage ... and kingmaking, you're out of the running but can seriously influence who wins.

Just got irritated playing, which isn't why I play games - couldn't find the fun at all :(

*** Update, played again, bit better experience this time, although I'm not convinced it works with 3, powers seem setup to balance each other out, with one missing one power has a bit of pressure lifted. So now it's at a stage where I'd play it again, but only 4 player ... and see how I feel. Rating could rise (but not that high I think) or fall ... can't make up my mind.

*** Updated, played again, I think it's better with 4 - I still don't feel like a chaos god playing it though, theme feels a bit pasted on, it could so easily have been something else. No desire to own a copy, would play (4 player) again though, rating is now a 5.

**** Thanks to trading I now own a copy and I've played it more and my opinion has changed, a bit, game is solid, but players need to know what they are doing and how each power wins, otherwise it can be a bit of a blow out. Still think the theme is a bit pasted on though.

**** Finally played it again, and liking it more - shame I can't get it to the table more often :(

RATING: 9
It's a unique, thematic, and entertaining experience.  One of those games that makes you think long after you're done playing.

Only have a few problems.  First, it's easy in concept, but difficult to teach the [i]right[/i] way to play.  You can also see the winner coming at the beginning of the final turn. Finally, each time I play I'm finding myself getting frustrated with the "roll 6, roll again" mechanic.  It adds even more randomness than having die rolls in the first place.

RATING: 8.5
I've played this 3 times so far and I want more.  The rulebook reads like this will be another unit placement and score euro, but that is so not the case.  CitOW is rife with opportunities for interaction, screwage and deal making.  Add in variable player powers and goals and I think you have a real winner.  It's only drawback is this game is a 4p or nothing proposition.

I don't know what it is but I'm just not that excited by this game. For area-control I'd rather play El Grande, and for a Warhammer themed game, I'd rather play Warhammer. Not that this game actually is, but each play of it feels very similar to me. Anyway, it's definitely not a bad game, just not one I enjoy.

Es un juego de dominación de areas del estilo del grande, pero con temática tipo Warhammer (Poderes Ruinosos). Cada jugador tiene su propia personalidad y segun con qué poder juegues tu estrategia debe ser una u otra. A diferencia del grande, no bastan con tener la mayoría, sino que hay que "vencer" la resistencia del terreno. Además hay mucha más interacción entre los jugadores.. es como si en el grande, los cubitos se pudieran pegar unos con otros.

Resumiendo: Es un juegazo. Altamente recomendable. Mínimo tres jugadores.. aunque realmente es un juego para 4.

Played a 3 player game that was very fun. I can see the full glory of the game will come w hen you play with 4 players.
I think that the asymmetry of the different gods make this a very good and varied type of game.
You will need to have some insight of all the different gods to know what they have to do to win.

Played a 4 player game and it was so much tighter game. We are still beginners, but the game give so much in the fun area. 
A game we will return to often I guess.

RATING: 8
Medium. Solid game. The asymmetry is interesting, as is balancing your dial win conditions with winning by points. There's a lot of subtle card play, with an importance on timing, and a good bit of interaction. Movement has an almost route building feel, as you spread units across the map to increase presence in different areas.

Hope to play some more, and try out all the different factions.

Great area control ameritrash game! The different character choices really has quite a bit of strategic depth concerning individual play styles, and some 'gods' are better suited to certain players than others. The gameplay is pretty straight forward and easy to grasp after a turn or so. It is also blatantly obvious when someone is not playing to their character's strengths.

Played only twice so far, but had a blast each time. I really like the distinct strategies that each god seems to have. The luck factor due to dice rolling in this game seems very minimized compared to other games that it didn't give me any grief; normally now dice are a huge negative for me but in this game they seem to add just enough randomness to keep things from being an over-analysis fest.

It's a pity the Slaanesh errata weren't terribly clear (even after downloading!) but otherwise this is a startlingly well-balanced game, given the four very different Chaos Gods.

RATING: 6.5
Only one play so far of my friends' copy of this. I know that it may take a couple of times through before I really get the interplay of the systems here, but I can't help but feel that this game is too bloated and old fashioned to stack up to it's new, flashier cousins. It sometimes feels like Blood Rage, but really is it's own beast, and that beast is a strange, chess-like interplay of systems that demands that you play each race a certain way. I'm sure that some may love that feel to the game, but I did not. It's too restrictive, and I never got the pay off of really "learning" how to make my race tick within a single game. It is deep, and I'm sure given enough time I would have that Ah-ha! moment, so for now I will concede that More Data is Required, but I also have a sinking suspicion that this one is not for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Okay as an AT game. The "balance" seems to be the big debate. Difficult to assess based on my one game. It's effectively an area-control/area-influence game with asymmetrical powers and goals. Some card driven mechanics and some simple dice rolling for battles.

Nothing overly innovative. The 'chrome' will be attractive to ATers. If they had been cubes of 'caballeros', then this game would have been trashed by euro-haters. Likewise, it's not better than some of the new editions of Risk - and the gameplay is not that different. But the Risk name is old school and the poster child for BGG bashing, so CitOW is now the flavour of the month that is all the rage and excitement.

As for strategy, doesn't the race that you play pretty well dictate how you play the game?

Update Jan 2010 to Nov 2012. Dropped from 6.5 to 5. Gave it a second chance. It's just meh.

Sadly my rating for this has dropped dramatically since my initial play. This game IMHO is massively overrated and typical of the recent over-euorised chromed up games. To many moving parts, cards, variables and conditions to keep track of. A fairly long playing time as well. The game in essence boils down to a clay pigeon crap shoot with virtually no planning or long term strategy to follow due to the random chaotic nature of the cards, combat system and whims of the other players. This is exacerbated by a 50/50 bingo roll combat system. Effectively Korn is trying to hit the other races on 50/50 rolls and the others are trying to avoid this. When you strip it down, that in summary, is all it actually is. There is also almost no point in other races using military pieces as Korn can simply allocate hits on the cultists first and ignore the other units. Pure luck which is made even more extreme by the bizarre cards. The swings are ridiculously huge as if Korn hits a lot, it gets dial advancements AND denies the other races their advancements. So it is actually a double swing. I spent 3 hours lining up cultists and just hoping Korn did not place units/cards there and/or hit. Please anyone tell me where the fun is in that. It really amazes me how a game like this can be rated in the top50 despite all this. If you want to play a quick combat game there are far better around.

A fantastic game of majorities.  There is a constant see-saw throughout between the various aspects of the game.  The variety of winning conditions make for a fascinating game where a play can strategise early about how they want to win the game and then enjoy the tense ride as they tactically deal with the ebb and flow of action over the course of the game.

Turns go quickly and there is little downtime.  The various Player Powers all play differently and the game will always run out a little differently each time.

Altogether - Chaos in the Old World is a very good game.

RATING: 7
I thought that this was a fun game.   I tend to like games where each player has unique goals and abilities, and this fit that mold nicely.   

It's certainly a game with some replayability because of this, so I look forward to playing it again.

It is dripping with theme, and the little character pieces are quite atmospheric.


Note on 2nd play (and rating dropped to 7 from 8):

I found the game a little frustrating in that it does appear that all players must be extremely aware of what other players are doing relatively early in the game to stop someone from taking a future lead that can become unsurmountable.

If purple or red get 2 rounds where they win dial-majority, the game is effectively over, and even a clever point victory can't win it for you.

I found myself multiple times reminding other players of the condition/strategies of opponents (and getting a little frustrated at their lack of urgency) to attempt to get them to help me stop such a lead, with mixed results.

In any case, I probably came over as being manipulative or pushy when I was just trying to prevent a lead that could not be stopped. I really dislike games where you are forced to campaign against other players. What was pretty obvious to me was not obvious to other players (and in a way was NOT obvious because it dealt with an early advantage turning into a bigger advantage later on), which just made me look like a pushy dick.

In this way, it does appear to be a very fragile game. One mistake by one player at the right time can enable an unstoppable future victory for another player. It is also incredibly easy to king make (either intentionally or not) for almost any player as the game end approaches.

First game was a 4 player. Everyone was new to the game and we did unit plaement wrong the first couple of turns. I won as Khorne in the last turn via dial placement. Nurgle had crossed 50 VP as well. The arbitrary nature of Khorne's win (dial has precedence over VP) kind of turned me off and I was the winner. In the end, I did not feel that I did anything significant to earn this victory beyond picking Khorne at game start. Still, was a fun game and will gladly play again.

I liked the one playing I've had of this game and definitely want to play more.  I don't think it will completely gel for me until I fully grok all the gods powers and how best to leverage them.

If you don't, they run the risk of not enjoying it (and thus never wanting to play it again.)

UPDATE III:  Weird how quickly Runewars supplanted this in my play list.  Still like CitOW a whole bunch, but I had to drop the rating a tad.

UPDATE II:  Top 10 Personal Favorites Game - rating up.

Update: Rating up. The differences between the gods means a different experience every time you play.  Unbalanced Old World cards made it impossible to win one game, but still did not diminish the game's fun factor.  The best area influence game since I played and enjoyed El Grande 10 years ago.

This is not a Euro with AT theme.  It's an AT game with some Euro mechanics.  I wanted to punch the people I was playing with - which is my personal litmus test for AT status.  The affronts were personal, and the fun was at the expense of others.  I highly recommend this game.

Tough game to rate. Quite random. Graphic design and presentation (except for the minis) is awful - map is hard to parse, fonts are unreadable as always, rules are the usual FFG incomprehensible sinkhole. The cool things are the 4 different factions with their own dials, event decks, and so on. The bad news is that the factions are pretty railroaded; Khorne particularly just plops down Bloodletters and tries to rack up dial advances, but the other factions aren't much better and are all more or less trying to do the same thing (score points for ruination while spending as little effort as possible to get the dial advances they need). It's all fine, it works pretty well actually, and there is nothing else quite like it (well, maybe GMT's COIN games, but those have a world of their own problems). But for me, there is nothing in there that stands and calls out to be played. I find Asgard's Chosen much more compelling (it's not issue-free either, but it's much more dynamic and thoughtful).

I have only played this as a four-player game.  Every time it is on the table, it is a lot of fun.  Some really interesting interactions between players always crop up.  Typically the table has a lot of back and forth aggravation, until someone starts to pull away noticeably from everyone else, then they get ganged up on.  The flow goes pretty well, and, once everyone knows the gameplay, is very quick and entertaining.

A very good thematic design and is lots of fun.

Impression after 1 play: An Euro area-control game disguised as a GW Warhammer game. (There are lots of these cross-genre games nowadays). Can be pretty unpredictable and, er, chaotic at times as the random events do affect strategy and plans tremendously. To play well, each player must be familiar with the winning conditions of all other players, Not sure if I like this game. Sort of so-so game only, if I am forced to rate it.

Theme, mechanics and gameplay are definitely fun. If you like fantasy or Role-playing, looking at the world through eyes of evil is a nice change of theme from dozens of games where you play for the good guys. The game however is tricky in a way that some sides are much easier to master/play than others, which leads to very uneven balance. It could take multiple plays (and loses) to learn strengths and tactics for sides other than Khorne, which is very straightforward and therefore pretty easy. 
My advise would playing without Khorne if playing with less than max number of players, and for other player to keep Khorn in check when playing with max players. The game also have a high tendency for "kingmaker" issue. 
If sides balance could be tweaked a bit, the game would be even more enjoyable.

RATING: 7
People who play with me know that I don’t care for theme at all, so I don’t really mind the Warhammer theme (which I know next to nothing about), though I do think it’s cool that it’s an area control game which doesn’t have a medieval theme or something like that. 

This is a game I had wanted to play for a looong time and finally got it to the table in April – twice! This meant a lot as in my second game I could still remember what the different factions could do. I think one of the most interesting things about the game is just that: the varied and very different factions. However, while the asymmetry is interesting, I’m afraid that the strategies for each faction are more or less dictated from the beginning; Khorne should probably not go for a VP victory… So I fear that there isn’t enough room to play your own game and I would like some more flexibility. That being said, the factions do play out very differently which was a big plus! Tzeentch is definitely my favorite god/race with Slaanesh a relatively close second. As I have only played the game twice (Khorne and Tzeentch), I would definitely like to play it at least three more times to try the two other races and to try Tzeentch again. And it sure isn’t a lot of games I’m going to play 5+ times, so that looks promising.

Furthermore, the 3 different victory conditions (and the possibility that everybody loses, though that’s unlikely to happen) was a great twist! You cannot just focus on ruining the land and getting most VPs if somebody else is close to having moved their little wheel all the way to the finish. In both of my games the games did end when somebody passed 50 points, but in one of the games the game wasn’t far from ending because of the “wheel” victory condition. 

One other problem I had with the game was the potential king making problem. The winner might not be the player who played the best, but rather the player who got picked on the least… The game isn’t your typical euro area control game. This definitely adds a twist of ameritrash though it’s still mainly a euro. I’m a euro guy by heart but I did like the ability to crush your enemies; it’s just a pity that the combat system doesn’t really work. In my second game, the Khorne player almost exclusively rolled 1’s and 2’s and didn’t stand a chance just because of sheer bad luck. I was thinking of buying the game before I got to play it. Now that I’ve played it a couple of times I don’t think I need to own it, and while I wouldn’t actively seek it out, I would be willing to play it a few more times to explore what the different factions have to offer.

I have upped my rating for this game as it made rather more sense second time round though it seemed too easy for me as the Khorne? (red) to win by manipulating the spinner thingy by winning skirmishes. I like the assymetry but am not familiar with the Warhammer setting so don't really appreciate the theme. The board artwork is dark and makes tokens difficult to see. The miniatures are nice but the cultists are quite fragile and break easily.

...and downed it again. I still don't get it, the board is a mess and the writing on the cards is just too small for my failing eyes.

After now 4 plays I have to upgrade it to 9. 
It is very easy to learn. Even in their second game newbs can play very competently and the power balance in the game is very good. 
Overall it is very amazing that four very different powers can be balanced so finely.
The 4 plays had VERY different feels depending on the Old World Deck influencing the games and the strategies used, so it shows a great replayability value as well.
Also it still remains the only FFG Title that we can play without constantly noticing "Oh we played that so wrong". 
So far only one minor point came up like that.

Update Feb-2011: After about 20 games, this verdict still holds up.

Interesting blend of war game, special powers/victory conditions, and resource/area majority management. Each player vying for regions on the board that can get them to their next "level up" is neat but still boils down the same problems of multiplayer wargames (he who gets picked on least normally wins).

[b]Includes the Horned Rat expansion.[/b]

Rated 7 after one play. I enjoyed this more than I expected. I've recently been looking to play various "dudes on a map" games, and this one was recommended by a number of people.

Bottom line is I like it. I enjoy the asymmetrical sides, the card play is interesting, and having various ways to win is intriguing as well. The game rewards familiarity, so bumbling through a first play was to be expected. I don't really care if the theme involves demons and puss and whatnot... the gameplay is pretty good.

Update: I picked this up in a trade, and I'm glad I did. Now with 4 plays under my belt, each with a different faction, I enjoy even more the assymmetry in the game.

Sometimes things haven't gone my way... some terrible rolls as Korne meant I had a tough time trying to catch up... but every play has been enjoyable. I'm surprised at how much the event cards really shake things up and create a new game each time.

Update: Two more plays and this one is a keeper, even though I might be able to sell it for a pretty penny now that the FFG license for Warhammer has expired. This is the best example of asymmetrical powers done right.

I guess this game is to complex for us, i like the theme and think it looks awesome, dark n creepy. But it has too much strategy involved for my gaming partners. Really wanna own this game, but i think it will never hit the table. its just me that like this kind of game..

Gioco asimmetrico davvero molto particolare, che porta i giocatori a devastare le terre del vecchio mondo come se essi fossero le 4 divinità demoniache del mondo di Warhammer! Nonostante ogni giocatore debba giocare in modo diverso dagli altri e gestire il proprio culto, il gioco ha un buon equilibrio ed è equamente possibile vincere con ognuna di queste divinità, personalmente adoro il gioco per il tema in quanto giocatore di Demoni del Caos in Warhammer 40k, ma anche come giocatore da tavola devo dire che è un gioco davvero particolare che vale la pena di provare e magari rigiocare come una diversa divinità poi.

RATING: 5
First impression had this one on par with El Grande and far better than Liberte. As with many area majorities games, there is so much smoke you think there must be fire. But the essence is pretty straighforward min/max question; merely the calculation requires a lot of inputs. The card-play certainly adds a richness to the majorities game, generating both tactical variety and player asymmetry. Oddly, I did not feel very disadvantaged by a lack of card-knowledge; they seem quite balanced in their way - a quite lovely feature of the game. The asymmetry of the player goals also creates a nice texture to boardplay and the incentive calculus. While the game does many things right, it still comes down to the fact that I don't have sufficient interest in this type of game to generate the patience necessary to work through board positions and find the best move. This is likely my shortcoming and not the game's, but I'm going to have to start this one off at a very personal, but somewhat uncharitable 5.

Tough to get to the table as it definitely wants the full compliment of four players. However, when it does come out, it is one of the best area control combat games that I've played. Love the different factions and how unique they feel. The game does rely on the players to self-balance and problems can arise with inexperienced players.

This is hands down my favorite game that I have ever played. Only plays well with exactly 4 players sadly so it doesn't hit the table for me often. This is a territory control game with tons of other stuff added in. It is also perfectly asymmetrical in that each player takes the role of a god of chaos that has different powers, units, victory conditions, etc. One warning, this game is very dark.

I'm not that big fan of asymmetric games because they're often tending to favor one side. After 2 plays I believe that chances on this one aren't balanced too. I also dislike the chaos created by the lots of counters (though it's fitting the game's name :)). During gameplay it's not too easy to see wether a region is close to be wasted or not.
Besides of that, this is a well designed game, fitting the theme and being full of suspension till the very end. Lot of thinking and decision making is needed to get a chance of winning. So quite perfect for those thinkers among us geeks.

I didn't pay much attention to this game when it was first announced.  No interest in Warhammer.  However, I got tagged to run a game for FFG at GenCon and so had to learn the rules without the game and only a week out to boot.  Once I read them though, I thought this would be a good game.

After running it and explaining it later to my wife, I have to say this is an awesome game.  It is very tight rules-wise and has an interesting valuation concept between the resistance and conquest value.  There are just enough old world tokens to affect all the different aspects of the game while being able to keep them all straight.  The interaction between the 4 Chaos gods is also pretty well balanced.  The set amount of rounds make this a fast-paced game where you have to strike fast and grab what points you can while making sure you advance your threat dial every turn at least once, if not twice.

This game went from a "no interest" to a must have" in a matter of minutes.  I think this is the sleeper hit of the Con for FFG.  If it doesn't get its due, it is only because it is overshadowed by the hype surrounding Middle Earth Quest.

Production is great quality.  The theme is interesting. 

The asymmetry is really interesting at first, but I'm afraid the varied strategies kind of get dictated to you depending on what faction you're playing. I'd like it a lot more if the game had more flexibility there. 

I've had some trouble getting this to the table, although I think its a decent enough overall game. I guess the 4p exactly limitation and the perception that there is a lot of conflict (mostly derived from the theme) make it a harder sell than it seems like it ought to be.

I was just getting into board gaming when I played this one, and I'm not a fan of the Warhammer mythos, so take my review with a healthy dash of salt.

I just can't see myself playing this again on my own volition.

Quite a nice production and a pretty good game to boot. T've only played 1 game (as Khorne) but it seems that the different gods would give slightly different play experiences.

I am not quite sure what all the fuss is over this. Is it the theme? Maybe if you like Warhammer or the dark theme. The game play is basically a chaotic version of El Grande with plastic figures and dice. Granted [i]chaos[/i] is in the title, so I guess that is what is to be expected. I would play it again, but there are much, much better area control games (El Grande, Twilight Struggle, Small World) without all the fiddly game play you are getting here. This is fair to middling at best.

 Chaos in the Old World was the first game we ever played on FNGN. Proclaimed as one of "The Most Balanced Games of All time" In part, I'm sure to the due diligence of the magnificent play testers. This board game is larger than life. The stakes are high, and the powers are enormous as these ancient gods do battle in each their own way to rule the Old World, that has no chance of survival no matter the victor. A series of complimenting game play mechanics make this a rewarding experience: combat, magic, special abilities, old world cards, nobles, tasty peasants, dial ticks, and RPG style upgrades unique to each god. Each god plays completely differently, adding to the replay value of an already deep and rich game. Not to mention an expansion that invites a fifth god into the mix, reinvents and re-balances the existing gods, thus changing the game completely...

Theme - tick.
High interaction - tick.
Nice components - tick.
Manageable length - tick.

After the first play, this one ticks all my boxes and I would like to play again. Khorne wiped the floor in the first play, but I think that was more due to inexperience than anything else. We let Khorne get away with too many dial ticks at the start to prevent the win. Won't make the same mistake next time.

It's skeletal structure is area control, but it's flesh and sinew is all variable powers, random cards and dice-rolling combat.  

My first play was very frustrating and that probably colors my opinion.  Literally everything I did in the first turn was eliminated or cancelled and I never got back into it.  As I started to "get it" it was really only in time to see that I had no hope.  

Would definitely try it again and it's possible rating would go up ... but it's just as possible that it wouldn't.

I apparently don't see what feller Eurogamers see in this. It did nothing for me. The asymmetry of players feels more annoying than gamey. I don't think the complexity over El Grande adds interesting decisions. In fact between the dice and the cards, you really can't take your decisions too seriously anyway. And speaking of cards, I really dislike them. And not just because they're wacky. I like the wacky cards in EG because they're public before they're selected and used. In Chaos people can (and do) play a card which was impossible to foresee, unless you know the distribution of the cards, but even still you don't know what cards people have in their hands. So a lot of it boils down to a crap shoot. Despite winning my first and only game, I have no desire to play again.

RATING: 9
Great asymmetrical player powers and varying win conditions. High levels of player interaction - there is no point holding grudges because you are all messing with each other! Rarely is there a run away winner with typically two or three players right in it during the last round. One minor downside is upgrade selection becomes pretty consistent as there are some that are clearly stronger than others. Remains a firm favourite in my game group.

Initial rating after my group's first play (4 players). Wow. This was fun. A LOT of fun. The rulebook is clear and accessible and the mechanics just seemed... right. Not one of us had the slightest inkling of what the whole Warhammer Fantasy setting was about (or of ANY Warhammer setting), yet everyone instantly - and gleefully - embraced his or her Chaos god's character and relished the conflict that ensued. Gameplay flowed nicely, despite the fact that we had to consult the rulebook very often (it was a learning game for all of us). In fact, we were all amazed at the amount of time that had passed (over 2 hours with all the rule-checking), because we'd all had such a great time. After the game, a lively discussion of Chaos In The Old World's merits ensued, with players discussing mechanics, possible strategies, the game's artistic merits, etc., etc., etc. Sadly, due to people's schedules, we'd started late and had to break early... or we would have gladly played again.

All in all, Chaos in the Old World enjoyed the most auspicious debut of any game my group has played in the two years or so we've been together. I look forward to seeing how well it stands up to repeated plays.

UPDATE: Everyone still loves the game! Its only drawback is that it plays a maximum of four, and my group usually numbers six.

A fun area control game with a simple combat mechanic and a deviant theme.

Very vibrant play with lots of options and different play tactics for each God to play.I like how each god must use a certain kind of tactic to win. Certain Gods would be easier to play with then other, but all in all FFG has done its necessary research to make it as similar to what the Old World in Warhammer would be, at the same time, providing an interesting gameplay that is Iconic of FFG.

However, the limitation of needing 3 players at least to play. And Only limited to 4 players is the most biggest disadvantage and jarring issue of not having more people play the game.

My rating is tainted by the fact that I simply don't like wargames.  The game has an interesting mix of different things you can do on your turn and victory options that make it feel more strategic that wargame-ish.  While it isn't something I would "want" to play, it isn't something I would mind playing again.  Still though, the game can get nerfed by bad die rolls or choas cards that negatively affect one player more than others.  I could see possibly upping my rating to a six with more plays, but, as noted, I don't see myself going out of the way to play again.

Playing as a Chaos god is pretty awesome. Smiting humanity while smiting your fellow gods is also awesome. This is not a light game and it involves actively working with and screwing over your fellow gods to take down everyone else and acquire the prerequisites for your win condition. There is so much involved that it's just a brilliant game. I love it. I can't wait to try the new expansion. Khorne seems to win a lot in our group, but Slaanesh and Nurgle aren't too far behind. It's usually Tzeentch that doesn't have a great advantage. Hopefully the expansion gives him a little more power.

The entire game felt like "avoid Khorne". All of the other gods can get their victory in isolation. It just seemed to come down to who gets attacked by Khorne the least. I played this a handful of times, then gave up.

Dripping with theme (and other unmentionable fluids), this game is hard to grasp the first time through, but it rewards persistence. A very fun, asymmetrical game.

Players who don't know much about Warhammer will have a hard time understanding the power dynamics and backstory.

RATING: 6
The upgrade system and variable player powers make this one interesting.  The game does seem to rely on player regulation to keep Khorne balanced, however, i.e. everyone has to attack Khorne regularly, otherwise Khorne will overwhelm.  Since I tend to be more of a fan of noodling in my own corner of the board and only attacking when necessary, this brings the game down for me.

(Also, Khorne may not win but s/he can absolutely play kingmaker.)

Great little minis.  Muddy board art.

RATING: 9
My initial rating - only 2 games so far. Very thematic, love the asymmetrical factions and different ways to achieve goals. Combat is fun, but a bit too random and I know many won't agree with me but I'd love to see some kind of battle cards just like in Blood Rage - or something similar.

Edit: Bumping to 9. Game has its flaws(some of the cards and upgrades are barely even used because they fit only a specific strategy which is hardly ever going to win anyway) but is excellent nonetheless. This is a definition of a game that I like - very high player interaction, messing with others, negotiations and lots of talking. Every game so far was really close and it all seems to be balanced really well - it's just a matter of difficulty of every god - some seem to be more straightforward like Khorne, while Tzeentch requires more careful and clever way of playing. Fun, lots of fun.

RATING: 8.5
Only 5 plays but I'm enjoying it very much.
Asymmetrical gameplay, lots of interaction and somewhat mitigated luck factor are all a big plus for me.

Except for the first 2 games, when we were still learning, Khorne has always won with different players, although it must be said that the opponets made several bad moves.
Tzeench and Slaanesh are the most interesting and fun to play, Nurgle seems the most challenging to me.

It was obvious from the first play that this is an interesting, well-balanced design, even with the crazy swingy ability cards. Really feels like it plays best with 4, and as 3-player game something was missing. I think I'd rather play Cthulhu Wars though.

RATING: 9
Being a fan of the Warhammer world, I really enjoy the theme and play of this game.  The four different roles are nice and diverse, lending to a interesting game where everyone is trying to do a little something different while still vying for territorial control.  The Old World deck adds some randomness, but I believe this adds to the flavor and experience of the game.  The two paths to victory (dial advancement, victory points) are great because of how they affect the metagame.  You have to focus on your own gameplan, but you can't ignore what everyone else is doing.  There is great balance.

Love the asymmetry.  My only complaint is that each game seems to play out roughly the same and the upgrades don't at all seem balanced; there's one for each faction that seems like a no-brainer and a few that seem pointless.  Maybe I don't understand the game well enough to see the subtitles in those other ones... not sure.

Still, it is fun.  Just not quite as much fun as I hoped.

Smallworld for horror fans.  No offense to people who like warhammer, but I don't.  I really, really don't and that put me off this game for quite some time.  However, I am a fan of ridiculous invented gods and dark imagery and settings.  Which is how this game would best be described.  And I love it.  I believe this game's rank is artificially low due to well-mannered, quiet sensitive Christian types who were offended by the theme.  Which really doesn't do it justice.

RATING: 7
Fun gameplay with not-so-useful components. Map is hard to dilineate certain areas, some of the tokens blend into the map art, and the Threat number on the dials is hard to see unless you're right above it looking down. 

Gameplay is very take-that, with players trying to convince opponents who to attack, or where to place creatures. Variable player powers makes for good replayability and varying strategies. 

Some wierd rules, such as the Ruination bonus for players who place a corruption counter in the region [i]on that turn [/i] despite having no real way to track which counters were placed when. Dial bonus just results in players all agreeing to prevent any one player (or trying to) from getting the most. 

I enjoy the limited access to card play in each region and the different "feel" of each faction. Rules were a little heavier than I originally thought. Not everything is immediately clear, so it's definitely more on the Ameritrash side than the Euro side of the coin. Look forward to more plays of this, even though I have no real interest in the theme (Warhammer). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Cool asymmetrical gameplay but requires the full player count to get the best game balance. Deciding on upgrading units, where to go on the board, and where to play cards are all part of the fun. Neat two paths to victory.

Miniature quality is not as good as some of FFG's other games as pieces are flimsier and prone to breaking.

Tremendo. Híbrid euro-trash, de majories, molt molt asimètric, on cada jugador controla un dels Déus/Poders Ruïnosos de l'Univers Warhammer. Cada jugador intentarà devastar, corrompre, desolar el Vell Món abans que ho facin els altres Déus, lluitant contra ells alhora que contra el taulell.
Les diferents maneres d'obtenir la victòria així com la tremenda asimetria entre els Déus, n'augmenten molt la rejugabilitat.

23/02/2015: Des del primer dia que interpretem malament els Nobles (afecten Slaanesh): cada noble dóna +1 PV quan es domina la regió. El noble NO augmenta la Resistència de la regió. Això ha perjudicat MOOOOLT a Slaanesh (li costava més obtenir supremacia de les Regions amb nobles que ell necessitava per girar la roda, i li donaven menys punts). Fins ara, Slaanesh ha estat molt perjudicat.

Tentative rating based on one play. A classic case of asymetry with very different objectives for each player. Replay value should be OK with the variety of Old World cards although the map may get a bit tiring.
On map play is almost an influence-in-areas game, but with combat, cards & pieces and multiple scorings (VPs & corruption).
Also has an aggressive edge where it is quite easy to bash the leader, but thats OK if you like that kind of thing.

Might up my rating after another couple of plays.

I own the expansion too, which has been fun to switch hit with now and again. I don't really have a personal preference between the base and expansion sets, but most of my friends seem to have drifted back to the original as their go-to.

RATING: 7
A hybrid game, that has the outside look of an Ameritrash game, but underneath the hood is an example of pure German efficiency. The game itself is one of area majorities where each player has a unique set of playing pieces and special powers. Each piece has a different role, with some responsible for helping to gain majorities, and others primarily about eliminating opponent's pieces. To mix things up, there are ways to win that are only indirectly related to gaining the majorities. These alternate win conditions are usually related to the area majorities, but there is one case (Khorne) where it is about eliminating opponent figures instead. A special event deck adds variety to the game, making this one a fun exercise, and an enjoyable gaming experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Players represent one of the four Warhammer old world gods, trying to dominate and ruin the old world.  Quite simple area majority game, where players take turns to place a follower or a chaos card into one of nine regions, spending power points to do so.  Combat then takes place, and regions are assessed for domination, corruption and ruination.  Repeat for eight turns.  Players win by either scoring victory points via corruption and ruination OR by advancing their threat dial to victory - a very neat mechanic that forces each player into asymmetric roles ... i.e. Khorne just kills stuff, but the others are more about corrupting different areas of the board.  I can see why this has it's fans - it's been very well designed and developed, and is intriguing.  I found the 150 minute playing time a bit excessive, and the "Khorne" juggernaut/paranoia tends to dominate the game.  Players have to quickly understand their place in the game, and experienced players will likely slaughter newbies.  The map artist obviously doesn't play the game ... looks nice, but awful to play on.  After two games, it's already beginning to feel a bit slow, dull and repetitive.

played once so far, and won my first game, playing Slaneesh.  I'd like to try Tzeentch next time.  There wasn't as much combat as I expected, and some of the mechanics, like the old world cards, seemed like unnecessary complications.  I'd like to try it again before rating it.

Edit: This didn't seem like the kind of game that would get played with my friends, so I traded it.

An old favourite and the only game that I ever sold and re-bought. This is an excellent area control game with asymmetrical player powers and a very dynamic board and game state. It's not really akin to risk at all. If you can get beyond the theme (which I like a lot) and some necessary viciousness I can imagine this game will appeal to most groups as it's ultimately pleasant melding of a euro game with a dice driven combat game, and also very thematic, in the way that the daemon's relationship is parasitical and symbiotic. Needless to say: I love this game flaws and all, it offers very high 'replayability', and will get better with successive plays (which I know most groups don't get to due to an intoxication with rampant novelty). 

It's fun to play as the different gods and to get to know how to play against them, but at the same time its fun to commit to one and stick with that. The pleasure in the interplay is very player dependent, there is even some space for alliances and negotiation.

Khorne to me is the most scripted to play and also by far the easiest to win with against inexperienced players. This is a good thing and a bad thing as if you have one new player it makes sense to let them play as Khorne. However someone playing Khorne 'badly' throws off the games delicious balance. On the other hand if you've played the game multiple times Khrone can feel very scripted, and your turn can be very brief as its deadly obvious what you should be doing, that might suit you, I prefer to play as any of the others. 

 Few criticisms of the game, namely that the four player count is much better than three. (I used to have the five player expansion and that was good also though not necessary really as the game doesn't really need additional variety - though it certainly doesn't hurt.) Other criticisms: board can get busy with tokens and minis. I wish the corruption tokens had been cubes so there was less fiddly counting. I wish the map was bigger and easier to read. I wish the minis were better quality and slightly larger. 

This game is better than Blood Rage. Mostly due to it being deeper (also longer) and much more thematic. Blood rage's incredible minis though incredible cause some cognitive dissonance in myself as it never really feels like you are invading anything with them or pillaging anything. Whereas you get a pleasant little-fingerish tickle slowly spreading your corruptive influence/violence across the board in this one, whether through tricksy magic or a simple lust for blood. Also blood rage is too dependent on knowing the cards, which can make the first play quite frustrating. There isn't a great deal of different cards in CITOW, once you've seen a couple of rounds you've seen a good proportion of them. Though in BR defence it plays well at all the player counts, I even liked 2 player, and is overall much more accessible though CITOW all falls into place after a round or two.

If FFG are looking to retheme this one post GW split. I'd go with a game of thrones retheme, with a new map and some different mechanics, or perhaps that would be lame, I don't know.

Made a dumb rule error last time I played, which is when an area is ruined everyone gets the number of points at the top of the card, not just points for first and second. Another common rule error is that you can't advance your dial more than two clicks in a turn and only one person can ever do that in a given turn.

SPARKS: Each character has something that they are GOOD at, that suggests a strategy, but the player interaction and events mix things up so much that you have to be creative while you stay focused on your goal.

Each item I have played this so far, I have immediately wanted to replay as THAT character.  This is really like 4 games in one as far as the enjoyment of discovery.  This game actually made me wish there were fewer games in the world so that this could get played more in my group.  I also wish there was a good way to play 2 player!

Although the theme is somewhat disgusting, that is quickly forgotten, when you sit and play this great area control game. The asymmetrical sides are amazing, each gently pushing you to a different playing style, which comes quite naturally. The different win conditions support the asymmetric style in being unequally achievable for the four different gods. 
The only bummer could be, that you should really play this game with four, not less, players.

(acquired in Larry's Great Moving Sale, Part 2).

I haven't seen a game where the theme is this tightly integrated into the gameplay since Dune.  And, since this is fundamentally area control with special powers, it's reminiscent of Dune in that regard also.   The game is mechanically quite simple, but since there are two ways to win (using points, or dial advancements) you really need to keep an eye on the other players and the tension level goes way, way, way up as a result of the dual paths.   Eric Lang is admittedly NOT a Warhammer player, but he absolutely did his homework and hit it out of the park.  The play styles of the 4 Chaos Powers are perfectly captured, and the game design inherently rewards playing to your power's theme and tactics.  Be warned - the game will probably lose significant appeal if you aren't into the Warhammer mythos.  It is sinister and unapologetic.  And that's exactly how Chaos is in the Warhammer world.  Too bad the bubblegum plastic figures are so poorly produced - that's my only real complaint.  Very inspired design, and definitely a long-term keeper.

What I would consider close to the perfect game. Combat, area control, roles that play differently, various paths to victory, an environment that is dynamic and changes. If I were to have one complete it would be that Tzeench and Slaanesh feel similar, there are differences but feel similar when playing. The other downside is it is a game that player knowledge and ability plays a role, when players know the game pretty equally and are equally proficient then the best game experience bar none. The player count of needing four is what keeps this from being my top game but I'll admit I'm hard pressed right now to pick what would be able this.

The one that really kickstarted all this madness for me again as an adult, and still a favourite. Benefits from four players of similar experience. Doesn't play well with three people at all.

None of that matters a jot though, as this game is totally amazing :)

Wanted to like this more than I did.  Variable player factions and differing objectives are a plus.  It just feels like some of them have a very scripted path to victory (points or dials, but forget about doing it the other way), and some have objectives that are way easier to complete than others.  It's also very cutthroat, since you have to stop the other players from achieving their goals as much as you have to accomplish yours.  
I don't especially like the way that there are only 2 slots for cards at each territory, so you can just get arbitrarily locked out of playing something there if the others beat you to it.
The upgrade system is nice, but kind of frustrating in that there are 5-6 upgrades you can do, some of which get better if you buy them together, but you'll have to work and struggle to get 2 upgrades by the end of the game.
It feels like combat is often going to be a frustrating mess.  You can't really defend, since even if you have a huge army of guys, your opponent can just waltz past them and attack your cultists, killing them off so you can't accomplish anything.  And if you're trying to attack someone in a non-critical area, they could always just re-deploy their guys and run away.
Anyway, it's this weird mix of euro and AT that is partly great and partly awful.

Not really my kind of game, I had fun playing it though. 
Seems to be very good in its category, but again I'm not very familiar with this kind (asymmetrical, thematic) of games. 
Also think game gains when everybody knows it well (and all gods specific behavior)
Not great for tactical/economy gamers.

possibly FFG's best original game design. A very tight and well engineered game. Asymmetrical and highly thematic. Its also very simple, the rules can be explained in minutes and this game only takes about 90mins. Despite this it feels like a big game. The only downside is the faction strategies are a little prescriptive. Each faction is geared towards its own approach so there isn't much room for strategic innovation on the players part.

Absolutely one of the most surprisingly fun games I've ever played.  On the surface, you would think it's heavily unbalanced and favors one god over the other, but it doesn't.  It's amazing just how close the race is when everyone knows what their power is capable of doing.

RATING: 8
My first board game that wasn't Monopoly, Checkers or Snakes & Ladders.

Bought this when on road trip through the USA, and played it every night (often multiple times) for a week with three other buddies. 

It's a fun, asymmetric, thematic (if somewhat dark) tactical miniatures game with a very strong Euro bent. 

The asymmetry is what drives this game. Every character plays vastly different. Khorne blindly throws soldiers into fights, and doesn't really care about any outcome other than kills. Nurgle picks a populous region and festers there. Tzeentch tries to interfere with other player's schemes while pursuing his own, and Slaanesh is attracted to nobility and heroes.

The asymmetry is also the greatest issue with this game. We had to house rule Slaanesh plays in second turn order, because of continued complaints that the Slaanesh player was too crippled by playing last. Khorne seems to win a large portion of the games. Indeed, the other players are often forced to work together for the first few turns, or it becomes far too easy for Khorne to win outright. 

These days my friends refuse to play this game, because the final turns suffer from Kingmaker syndrome. Because of the way game victory is resolved, and the inherent strengths of the Khorne and Nurgle characters, a player will often be forced to decide whether Khorne or Nurgle wins. Maybe this is something that can be house ruled out, but it's not something we've explored.

All the same, I still rate this game highly, and recommend it to anyone who thinks the journey is more important than the victor.

RATING: 7
I played Slaanesh in my one and only game. I picked up other upgrade then defence for cultists (it's a must) and had no chance to survive as each turn I had almost all my cultist wiped out from the board by another player. Also the dice can be frustrating. However the game has potential and I will gladly try it more.

RATING: 6
Good.  Kind of a lot going on at first, and it takes a while to gel.  The theme is pretty good; I especially like how all players can lose.  The scale is a little zoomed out -- maybe necessary when you're a proxy for a dark god, but there's detachment and then there's detachment.  Overall it is an above-average game, nowhere near as dry as the usual suspects in the area control arena; nonetheless area control needs a lot of help to remain interesting.

Eh, I would think this game would appeal to me.  I've played it a few times and it seems I am the default "khrone" player; everyone in the group sees me as the person that would do best at a slaughter-them-all victory path.  Don't get me wrong, there's something fun about targeting those damn nurgle, but I feel like the game drags.  I don't ever care about corruption and maybe as a result I'm missing a key part of the game.

This is a game you do not play with your significant other. Not if you want to ever have a chance at private time with them again. Its a great game that you play with people you dislike so you can just send your armies to brutalize and use cards to screw the player you can't get to. 

This is a great game and I enjoy it immensely, but you do not let friends play this game against one another. Its such a backstabbing brutal game of war.

Positive Points
---------------
-Asymmetric play and win conditions are really fun
-Nice miniatures and, in general, nice components
-Tons of replayability... would likely take several plays of each god to fully appreciate strategy and tactics and the expansion comes with completely new chaos decks for each god

Neutral Points
---------------
- Resolution of combat, domination and corruption is a bit repetitive

Negative Points
---------------
-Map gets really crowded in some regions with chaos cards, tokens and minis... makes it confusing to sort all out

Overall
-------
Chaos In The Old World is a thematic and thinky dudes on a map game with asymmetric win conditions and play styles. The map can get a little too crowded in some regions, making it difficult to clearly see what is going on and resolution of combat, domination and corruption gets a bit repetitive, but otherwise a really great game. Due to the asymmetric and card driven mechanics, this is a type of game that requires repeated plays to fully appreciate. I would recommend this game above other similar games I've played (e.g. Kemet, Blood Rage and Cyclades) to groups who are looking for a deep game, with lots of replayability (that is, they want to play a game 10-20 times), but it may not be as good as those other games for groups that will play it infrequently (couple times a year).

RATING: 9
Amazed by this game. Looks really grim and I like that, plus the assymmetry and balance among the four characters is well done. The only downside I see in this game is that you need four players for it to play really well. But man, when you manage to gather four people who want to play this, it is engaging. Thumbs up.

Wow!, 3 player game, all 1st time players, endgame so tight, I would have won had my dial gone first, instead the Khorne player won. Other play only 2 clicks away or 5 VP. Near perfect game design. This will be a staple. Now to find a 4th player.

I Enjoy playing this game whenever we are able to. It's very tense and balanced - Even though it can have some bad luck swing and kingmaking
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is the decent blend of AT and Euro mechanisms. I say this because on one hand you can try for area majority/VP and can co-exist with certain of your opponents units without resulting in combat. Each god can try for completing objectives for various benefits throughout the game as well as an instant Victory. Direct conflict can also be advantageous through your units/cards. Finding the right mixture of strategy and tactics based on what your opponents are doing is key for victory.  The asymmetrical powers of the four gods are fun to explore.  What makes this an interesting design is that it's a wonderful blend of euro area control with ameritrash combat and ccg-esque card abilities.

Every game has it's flaws. If I was to pick one with this game is that it can be very chaotic. This shouldn't surprise you as the word is part of the games name. No matter how well a person plays, you may not have a chance in winning based on the player induced chaos and potential kingmaking.  While the 4 gods seems to be mostly balanced with one another, in the base game anyway, there are some upgrade cards for each god that are better than others which leads to a bit less choice in the game.

Other things to mention is that there is an action point system in place which I like, dice is used to resolve combat which is ok, and it will not be a 3 hour affair like some other FFG games which is awesome. The visual design and components are heavily themed (and sadly, not very functional at all), though some may be turned off by the theme. 

This used to be one of my favorite games, but it's fallen out of favor due to a very disappointing expansion, some points I haven't mentioned and, various reasons I outline here:

A great area control game with a hefty dose of combat as well as player-specific powers and victory conditions. For better or for worse, each player really needs to compete with every other player -- trying to play your own little game off on your own will let someone else run away with the game. The one aspect I'm not too fond of is the Old World event deck (perhaps the deck should be revealed before the game then shuffled?).

A pretty classically mediocre area control game gussied up with plastic figures and a 'thematic' board.  The game doesn't play out with the building verve of El Grande, and gameplay felt too fixed by the different player powers.  Works ok, but there are better games of this type.

I traded my El Grande Decennial as a result of this game. Why would I want to play boring old El Grande when this area majority game is soooo much more fun?  The game combines tactical area majority maneuvering with timely card play and variable powers/victory conditions. We're slowly getting better at learning how to keep Khorne in check and drive the game to more of a race between dial tick and VP victory. Downtime is next to nill, and as someone who doesn't like chaos in his games, I totally don't mind it here for some reason. Maybe it's because I have an idea of what the cards are at this point and I don't count on each move but rather throw a bunch at the wall and hope at least some of them stick.

One of the best parts about this game that has yet to fail for us is that it provides a wonderfully strategic experience while causing great table talk and laughter. Not many games can pull off that double whammy of goodness. 

I do have some concerns, however, about the game devolving into kingmaking at the end. I’ve seen more than one game where a player had to choose between Khorne or one of the other players.

Both in theme and in terms of game mechanics, CITOW gets a 10.  The gods are finely balanced (though some might be trickier to get the hang of than others), and the gameplay is immensely enjoyable.  It's a clear sign that the game is wildly fun when role-playing your Chaos god becomes harder and harder to resist as each turn passes.

My only gripe is that you really need 4 players to play it, and it's very difficult for me to find a full stable of 4 players.  The game *works* with only 3, and remains quite enjoyable, but the balance flies out the window, and some gods instantly become stronger or weaker depending upon which god gets left out.  I also don't like that, for a couple of the gods, at least, it is detrimental to experiment with variant upgrades, especially in the case of my beloved Nurgle (you HAVE to take Provender of Ruin, or you simply can't win).  Because of that, there's little incentive to try out different power combinations.

One of the better themed games I've played to date, Chaos is one of those few board games where you often unintentionally begin to get in character while playing the game.  This is due in large part to the amazingly balanced asymmetrical gameplay, where each of the Chaos Gods you can play as has a very distinct feel and playstyle to them, yet none of them really seem to be able to dominate the others, since each is able to somehow counter the advantages of another.  The random events going on in the background of the players' struggle for domination over the map ensure that even if you stick with the same God, each game will feel unique.  This game really shines when you get a full game of four players who are able to get past some relatively complex rules and gameplay, to understand their God's advantages and weaknesses and really get into their roles.  Perhaps not for everyone, but highly recommended for those who think being an evil God is even marginally appealing.

RATING: 5.8
Graphically pleasing.  Disappointed that the Cultist miniatures break so easily.  After 4 plays by adults, several of them are damaged--the star comes off the top of the staff & that is what identifies them so easily.  

A better player will know the special abilities and cards available to each god, so they can try to foil their opponents.  This makes it very difficult for a new player to enter a game with experienced players. 

Luck with the draw of the cards.  Possible for the game to beat all players.

A Fantasy Flight game that I don't have to make plans to play two weeks ahead of time? [b]What?[/b] A great, medium-length, medium-to-high-complexity game. A very different experience each time, depending upon which Ruinous Power you're playing, and I love that there are a lot Of Old World cards but only a quarter of them get used each game.

So far, Nurgle and Slaanesh have won every game I've played in. Khorne has come very close via the dial. Tzeentch is definitely the hardest to play, but I personally find him (her? it?) to be the most fun so far. (I've heard of one of my friends winning as Tzeentch, but I didn't witness it. One Tzeentch player we had fought Nurgle to a tie before losing at the last possible minute.)

I've played once with 3 players: it was fine. But with the intended 4-5 players, it's one of my absolute favorite games, so I'd rather save it for those occasions. If you insist on trying a 3-player game, I recommend leaving out Khorne.

[thing=95619]The Horned Rat[/thing] is a great addition as well, but I wouldn't use it in a 4-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Playing evil gods of Chaos is tonnes of fun! This is a theme-heavy game with crazy interactions, built on a solid, elegant base. Controversial points are the high amounts of randomness, unrestricted (but costly) aggression, and dominant playstyle for each side.

Duration: Pretty fast for its kind; there is no building up and players get straight into the struggle. There is some accounting but it's not that long.
Design: Drama and theme atop elegance and balance, with plenty of variety from random events and the different Chaos Powers you can play. The Chaos Powers are have different objectives, types and number of figures, ability cards, and play styles. Games tend to be very close, with lots of directed aggresion and temporary alliances. Ganging-up and the unrestricted potential for hostilities are tempered by a design that tends to make aggression stall a player's progress, and the ambiguity over who is actually in the lead. Unfortunately, there are useless and semi-dominant cards and upgrades; the rules have loose ends and ambiguities, and it's clear that some effects are written different than intended (usually weak Old World cards). Additionally, I've grown a bit tired of the Khorne-management aspect of the game. One major issue is the 3-4 player restriction.
Strategy: Each side has different strengths and weaknesses, and ganging up lasts only a turn or two as the leader is swiftly replaced. There tends to be a particular playstyle for each side but there is enough happening each game that there are many options within that style. So far there doesn't appear to be a dominant side or strategy within a side, partly because of the unrestricted directed aggression.
Components: Reference material contains errors, and rules are ambiguous on many points. Figures are flimsy, board is beatiful but camouflages pieces.
Theme: Brilliant Warhammer Fantasy theme realised in the different sides; Old World especially is abstracted, but still retains character in events.

My nitpicks are:
* Too many useless cards - many upgrades, including all the warrior upgrades will never be used competitively, and many chaos cards are so situational as to be irrelevant;
* Nurgle's dial is impossible rather than implausible;
* Too much resisting Khorne at the beginning;
* Not enough fighting;
* Low threat from Old World.

I'm rating this with the Horned Rat expansion since I think it improves upon every aspect of the game.  Normal rating follows:

The asymmetric nature of the game makes for a very interesting multi-player direct conflict game, but for whatever reason just hasn't managed to capture my imagination, most likely because these types of games just aren't really for me.  Regardless, it's one I'll happily play if not actually suggest.  I would give my highest recommendation to anyone who likes that sort of thing.

After 1 play: An interesting thematic game with lots of theme, where each race/demon feels and plays really quite differently.
There's some possible rules confusion over our game, but it was good fun, and I would be interested in playing again, although it is not a game I would own, the theme doesn't quite sit right with my beliefs.

RATING: 5
Theme-heavy and typically narrative, as are most games of this type.  But the game itself is somewhat lacking.  This is probably because it is difficult to balance the differing purposes of the chaos gods.

New players will always suffer the chore of having to familiarise themselves with the possible paths to victory; almost certainly dooming them to defeat.  further to this, it seems a lot of decisions are rendered pointless by the inherent chaos in the game (which is thematically sound, but mechanically bland).  Naturally, as with any game of this nature, more experience will mitigate the chaos; but with so many better games of this type out there I'm not so sure I can be bothered.

RATING: 6
Never got into a groove with this. It's dripping with theme and it's well-balanced, but there are a few too many moving parts for a relatively light game. You absolutely need to micro-manage to maintain any control and it seems to me that it comes out just a bit off on the responsibilities to actual gameplay ratio. I assume if you play it regularly the bookkeeping becomes second nature, but for irregular play it can be dull and taxing to track the bells and whistles.

Would still jump at a chance to play if a group wanted to focus on CitOW for a few weeks. I think my overall suggestion is: proceed with caution. It's not a game you can half-ass and expect to enjoy.

Say what you want about GW, they have a fantastic little piece of IP. This game does a great job of playing to the flavor of the different Gods of Chaos. Slaanesh seeks out heros and noble with which to corrupt and seduce. Nurgle seeks populous regions so that he can better spread his disease. Tzeentch seeks warp stone and other sources of magic. Khorne just wants to kill stuff. Perfect!

Too much going on. Too chaotic (lol). It is fun but huge swings in power take place. You never really know who is winning. I have lost (badly) every time I have played this game (5 times I think), which doesn't help me rank the game any higher.  The board is confusing but unique.

Neste jogo nos somos deuses do mal fazendo uma série de ações tentando corromper completamente as áreas do tabuleiro.

Based on one game with 4p. The number of choices and their impact felt somewhat limited. Dice is ok if their impact can mitigated or add to a narrative. In this case neither is true. Huge plus for maxing out themewise and assymetric roles. Guess grade can increase with more plays.

RATING: 7
Chaos is a successful hybrid between euro and ameritrash. The euro part certainly dominates as it is mainly an area-control game but theme and (small-scale) dice battles play a prominent role as well.

The most distinguishing factors of the game, however, are the asymmetrical player powers and the end-game conditions. Each of the Chaos gods has its own character and respective powers all of which require very different strategies. Despite these differences all gods seem to be balanced very well. Additionally, the game can end on a score of conditions and depending on which end you're working towards you need to emphasise different aspects during the game. They even have an ending where the Old World wins and all Gods lose collectively.

This is my favorite game.

It has multiple win conditions, completely asymmetric and balanced powers, and each game is unique thanks to the old world deck. It's pretty streamlined, very thematic, and all the different card interactions make it exhilarating to play. I think these strengths, uniquely combined in this game as far as I can tell, make it the best game made to date. Huzzah!

Rating based on the bad experience with the game, probably should have rated it a 7. It's a solid euro with diced combat pasted on - probably a contract obligation by Games Workshop. That combat is what kills the game for me - it's boring and doesn't fit the game. Also some of the events can  negate the starting powers of the different gods, which is dreadful.

Blood Rage is just so streamlined and quick while Cthulhu Wars is insanely modular and the achievement system really makes the game sing.

Chaos in the Old World: The Horned Rat Expansion


Man, this is so much fun.  Corrupt the land, purge the villagers, eviscerate the heroes, chaos reigns.

Combat, area control, variable powers, dice-chucking, and lots of cardplay.  The whole 'energy' track where players take turns playing cards, trying not to run out of energy (or else they have to pass and are unable to respond to what opponents do anymore for that round)...it's really a sharp design and one of the best of the year it was released.

I don't like how it stops at 4 players, but the expansion fixes that.

Pretty disappointed in that one. I know not everyone feels that way, but to me (us) the theme felt completely pasted onto a bunch of mechanics that didn't work particularly well together. We didn't identify with the chaos gods, there's no sense of progression or drama and the board is pretty inert. I mean there are events, but they don't really define how the game plays out they're just some chrome on top of it. No major flaw, true, very nice components, balanced mechanics, but all in all I have a really hard time seeing it played again (all the more so now that it's sold away).

Fortunately, Chaos in the Old World worked out. There is always some concern about asymmetrical games and especially ones where certain factions are rated by some to be easier to win with than the others. It did have this appearance, but certainly it isn't the case. I do think that some understanding of the game's mechanics are necessary to play it well with any of the factions. Although it's hard to play well when it is your first time (easiest with Khorne though), it is a game that encourages you to play multiple times and learn the different strategies that are available. Overall, a good mix of card play, dice battles and unique player skills and goals. A little clunky for the first time, but turns move relatively quickly. Not having a minimum knowledge of the factions does make for a somewhat chaotic game.

Mroczna gra, z której aż wylewa się klimat Starego Świata (który wcale nie był mi znany przed rozgrywką). Asymetria z dodatkiem losowości przy rzutach kośćmi w ramach walki gwarantują równe szanse zwycięstwa każdej frakcji. Duży plus za to, że raczej nie ma problemów ze zrozumieniem instrukcji, od razu po jej przeczytaniu można zagrać. Karty Chaosu, wydarzenia, kolejność, rozmieszczenie żetonów na mapie - wszystko ma znaczenie dla indywidualnej rozgrywki i strategii. Należy bezustannie obserwować poczynania przeciwnika, żeby nie znaleźć się z ręką w nocniku :) Grę mimo wszystko paradoksalnie nazwę sympatyczną i muszę przyznać, że sprawiła, że zainteresowałam się światem Warhammera. Z niecierpliwością czekam na więcej rozgrywek z różnymi graczami :)

This is a really, really well made game. The components are quite nice for one but the gameplay has just the right balance. The asymmetrical player powers blend for a really nice experience. FFG usually has terrible playtesting but somehow they hit it just right with this one. It just works.

I tend to prefer bigger, longer, heavier games but on occasion I'm in the mood for a 1-2 hour ameritrash foray with superb balance and that's when I turn to Chaos in the Old World.

It feels like a more complicated Nexus Ops.

[b][i]Chaos in the Old World[/i][/b] is an area control game with asymmetric player powers. The four players are 4 chaos gods of the universe of Warhammer and each god is played very differently. With abilities that are so diverse, it's amazing that the game is balanced. I know nothing about the Warhammer universe or why that particular implement of hand-to-hand fighting is important enough to spawn a franchise, but the different abilities give enough character to each god that I can't help saying "Blood for the blood god!" whenever my red soldiers kill an enemy. The upgrade dials are a fantastic addition and make Chaos in the Old World unique. They also serve to give each god immediate direction and suggest strategies for each player (further differentiating the different gods).

You are the bad guys in this game. You spread evil across a continent and, with cards like Rain of Pus, the game doesn't apologize for this. This will bother some. A more egregious problem (in my opinion) is that the game is not very flexible on the player count. It's amazing with 4 players, okay with 3, and otherwise unplayable.

What an interesting mix of majority control and pure evil Warhammer goodness. There is a good amount of randomness and it seems like you really have to go with your side's special abilities. Just the same, you are generally rewarded for good play, just be sure to keep everyone in check.

The art is dark, the theme is dark. You are playing the baddies in a very dark game world, so yes, not for sensitive types or kids. If you like the Warhammer world, I'd think you'd enjoy this, unless it ends up being too Euro for you.

I have a hard time finding fault with this game and I can't think of a better dice-rolling majority game. It has strategy, but there is a good amount of variety and I am a sucker for games where each player has unique strengths and weaknesses.

This game is a bit asynchronous as there are two major ways to win (1) by VP (2) by advancing your races "dial" to a "you win" level.  Each of the four races has different powers and units which give them fairly unique flavors.  I need to play more to see how well the races are balanced.

As a side note the them is pretty dark as the players represent dark gods, each with the goal of either corrupting the world or killing as many others as possible.  I like the game mechanics but don't think its suitable for anyone under the age of 13, and even then its pretty dark.

What this games has that I haven't seen in any other game are direct attacks against other players without negotiation. This is an effiency game, you have so much points to summon guys and cards and that's it, you must do more with that than your rivals. And that's a lot of fun because it's the best of both worlds, a lot of direct interaction that ends up being very meaningful thanks to the efficiency lying underneath

The reason this game doesn't get AAA status is that half of the cards are simply so terrible, that you are never going to use them. That's kind of a bummer and while it doesn't ruin the game, it's pretty boring to see.

If you are expecting something exciting where gods really duke it out to taint the old world then you probably want to move along to something else quick.

Instead of pulse pounding game with lots of theme this game might as well be one of those ultra dry area control farming or medieval city building games with cubes. Because that is what our group felt like after playing it.

It has great looking minis, a cool map, a nifty multidial on the board advancement mechanic... but it lacks.... character, excitement, and most of all fun.

Combat is nearly Smallworld dull, and the game seems more of a chore than a game.

Expect nearly zero GW flavor in this game.

If you enjoy area control snoozefests and want to pretend you like trashy games, you will like this game alot.

The only overall positive about this game is that I finally found a game that I can rate a 3.

Perfection with 4 players.  Don't even think about doing a 3 player game.  With 4 players, this game is a masterpiece of strategy and theme.  The only downside, and this is a very small one that's only due to personal tastes, the Risk-like dice factor in combat, brings an amount of luck that may irritate some players, especially if the blood god keeps getting high rolls and the dreaded 6's.  That said, this game is won more by a well thought out strategy plan than by luck.

A game group favorite, medium learning curve, some gods being easier to learn than others. Pretty much a grimy blood fest. good times. Never let the game win! Mix of dice and card strategy. Always recommend playing with 4 people. Very thematic with a balance between spilling blood or corrupting for points

I feel if you do not play with 4 people there is a huge change in gameplay not for the better.

Also even though I love this game, I feel there is a slight learning curve which makes me reluctant to bring out with new gamers. do not like playing this game without 4 people. sometimes it feels slightly slow computing corruption and domination each turn. not by much though

On the surface it looks more like a war game, but really in its essence it's an area influence game with battle mechanics.

Just ordered it through Amazon!
Couldn't get it so I ordered it through my local game store.

UPDATE
We played tonight. Very promising game. 
I think I'll need more plays to appreciate more. ;)

UPDATE
Hm... there is an other level of complexity I haven't seen at first glance. This game is something I say. :)

UPDATE
Best 4 player game I have. 

UPDATE
Had a true BLAST out of this game! Still I have some concerns about the capability of Khorne to play and win in a group of expert players. 

UPDATE
The more I play, the more I can see subtleties about this game. The more I play it, the more I like it. I confirm this as my best 4 player game under two hours.
  
UPDATE
Without doubt, at more than a year from the first purchase I really love this game, and I'd never trade it away. This is the keeper game. 

UPDATE
After two years from the last update this game still holds its own on the top. I love this game and it has been the best investment for my money ever. 

UPDATE
Again I've played this after some time. Same love, same variety, this is probably my only and truly "10" game!!

A truly brilliant 4 player game.  Each of the 4 factions has a distinctive feel and playing style and completely different strategies and paths to victory.  The theme is superbly executed, and while a little dark (the board is made to look like human skin), really brings to life the 4 different chaos powers.  Each time I've played somebody has found a new combination of powers, or way of gaining an advantage, and there has always been more than one person close to winning.

RATING: 9.5
The best asymmetric multi-player game I've ever played, as well as one of the best games I've ever played, period. Each Chaos God is completely unique, the theme is incredibly well-integrated, player interaction is through the roof, and games are always tense up until the very end. I haven't felt anything less than complete satisfaction after completing a match so far - either winning or losing.

Another great game by Eric Lang. It feels similar to Midgard, but with different strategies to adapt for different races and the variability involved with the chaos cards, makes for a strong game that will withstand many repeats.

I don't know anything about the source material for the theme of this game, but I did like the numerous balancing aspects. Each player has two ways to win: one straight-forward and the same for all, the other more subtle and unique to each player. This allows for some interesting dynamics and changing alliances through the game. Would like to try it again.

RATING: 10
A very well done multiplayer asymmetrical game. Each god feels different and their strategies show it. Furthermore, each strategy is easy enough to understand, all players are able to play their god to the best of its ability. The strategy flows nicely without too many needless bits and accessories. Combat is simple and satisfying--a dice rolling method that I am fond of. This is a unique game that I haven't seen another offer. If you ever have 4, this should be on the table.

Played the first game wrong (no thanks to FF's misprints.  I should have checked for Errata and the FAQ list before puting this on the table).  So Slaneesh took an easy dial victory only having to place 1 corruption marker.  The game ended in the 3rd round as a result. That being said, I saw the fun in this game and wish I had a regular 4 man game group to play this one more.

Asymmetric area control game with multiple routes to victory. It's actually quite a good game, one I did not expect to like going in, admittedly. So why only a 6? Well, part of that is my limited enthusiasm for area control, part of that is the theme being kind of meh. Lastly is the event cards can make things annoying, but they do improve the variability.

hhhhhm, I really can't compare it to anything, risk ;)

It definitely feels AT.

I like the two ways of victory AND one way of 'total' loss.  I think it when a 'non-coop' game puts in a way for all players to lose.

You are basically 'leading' demonic forces that are spreading throughout the land to 'corrupt' the various countries and bring them into 'decay'.  You do that by spreading your 'followers' and they spread corruption.  When a country is corrupted to a certain point it falls into decay and points are awarded.  You get points for just adding corruption, and then the 1st and 2nd place get bonus points.  So, this part feels somewhat like El Grande (or any area control game were it's about placing and not 'killing').  The points are for killing, killing is valid, but at that point it becomes about 'depriving' of points and not about scoring points.

There is, however, a secondary win condition.  Each 'power' has it's own way of 'corrupting' the world.  If they do that in a turn their 'dial' turns.  Who ever does the most to furture their god gets a bonus turn.  If it turns 7 times they win.   Each turn also scores points, bring more things onto the board, or improves your forces.  This also indicates 'your threat level'.  Bad things in countries normally trigger against the forces that represent the highest threat, while the one with the lowest threat gets to choose things when there is a choice.

Also, you get to play 'chaos' cards onto the board which helps you or hurts others.

I'm not sure how balanced it really is.  I think Nurgle might end up being a bit harder to play then the others.

Khorne goal is to attack others and peasants on the board.  So, they can move around to whereever their targets are.  Slannish needs to corrupt where nobles and heroes are, the game starts with quite a few on the board, more might come on during the game AND he has 'Chaos' cards that allow the player to move them where he needs them to be.  Tzeentch needs to corrupt where magic is.  There are a few Warpstones start on the board and a few come on during the game.  But, he also gets the benefit that some of the actions other people do will help him in his goal.  So, he gets some flexibility on where to go.  

Nurgle on the other hand must add corruption to 'populous' states on the board.  There are only something like 4 or 5 of them and they are static.  I think he had a spell which would make one 'populous' but it didn't seem to come out.  But, the goal seemed a lot more 'static' then the others.  That's why I'll need to play it some more to see how balanced it really is.

My search for a decent new Ameritrashy game is now closer to being over. I've had a few inconclusive attempts in the past year or so. Attack, Conquest of the Empire, Monsters Menace America, Neuroshima Hex, Heroscape, amongst others. None have truly grabbed me yet. Enter Chaos, I really like this one, after only one play learning the rules. Even the fantasy theme, which often puts me off, seems to make mua lot of sense here. I think I might even raise the rating on this one if my group plays this a few more times.

Holy crap--an in-house FFG production that moves quickly and feels (mostly) balanced? I am shocked and impressed. Very asymmetrical with minimal rules overhead, and very thematic with minimum flavour text. It's less open than I'd like, though--the turn structure is a little more rigid than necessary. That, and some of the cards are annoyingly punitive.
I think Cthulhu Wars improved on this design.

It is a game that I have liked enough; the bad thing is that they have to be 4 players, because with 3, it does not work equally of good. I extract him for these occasions; when we are 4. I think that it is a game in the one that of 2 ways of winning, independently of the "power" with which you play, is easier to win " moving the wheel " that reaching 50 points of the board. It is a game that is very balanced and in some occasions, we have battled in a region during some shifts, when it was close to be devastated. I amuse myself enough with him.

Once you have got one game out of the way and you start your second game with a group that has all played it before is brilliant. Each and every one of you will be so close to winning. Each time I have played since I have been on the edge of my seat up to the final moment.

A decent game made difficult by poor presentation of the relevant game information. The board seems to actively attempt to conceal the informtion I want presented most clearly. I would play more often if it weren't for this. Chaos cards a little too chaotic but balanced for a majority of the games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wow. It's like el grande slept with my copy of the warhammer fantasy daemon codex?  This is a really flavorful and easy game with surprisingly close balance.  The combination of risk like battles and area majority scoring provides a nice backdrop for the metric shitload of old school warhammer flavor on the chaos cards, the gods' threat dial victory conditions, and the differences in the units.  My only trepidation about the game is that I doubt it plays as well with three.  EDIT: With the horned rat, you can now play with 4 or 5 either, which helps some.  It plays OK with three, but is far superior with 4.

A lot of the balance comes from the players watching what the others are doing.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing and is hard to avoid in a game where there is a lot of interaction, like this one.  One great thing about this game I didn't appreciate the first time is how fast it is.  It truly is about a 90 minute game, but it feels like a big epic longer game.

Disclaimer: I hate this game. I thought I would really enjoy it, but enjoyment of this game really falls flat when some people are trying to play what they feel is a "best strategy" without realizing that they are basically king-making. One of the powers is very strong, the others need to work together to beat him, and if one player doesn't get it the game gets very un-fun. I paint the minis, though, so that's kind of fun. I played the expansion and it balances the teams, but this game requires each player has the same level of knowledge, otherwise it turns into a session of telling each other what to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This one takes a few rounds to get your head around, but I liked it. It did seem like it was possible to jet from first to last and vice versa, but perhaps the players could work together to stop this kind of thing. In fact, that may be the biggest drawback I see: players really need to be aware of everything their opponents are trying to accomplish, and this isn't easy with so many victory conditions and player powers, especially the first time through. However, it definitely seemed at times like all four players had a shot at winning at times, and there are lots of interesting choices to make. 

UPDATE: Came back to this one a few years later and found some of the same issues, but mostly a solid game. I really feel that Eric Lang's more recent effort, Blood Rage, does what this game wants to do only better. Granted, if you are a fan of having a particular strategic path assigned to you rather than drafting one, you may prefer CitOW, but I really feel Blood Rage is better in every way.

1/30/2012 Update: If you don't mix it up, the game has a run away leader for threat. It wasn't even Khorne.  The game lasted 3 turns.  I am moving it down to a 6 from a 10 until I or someone finds out why the game went south so fast.  A game enjoyment should not be based on the style of the players.  It should welcome all strategies.

Considering its relatively short length, this game is really deep. I also really like the background of course, but the different styles of play that the four powers have to adopt, together with the different ways to win for each of them, and the replayability through different ways the board is set up, make this a clear winner.

The only downside is that it's only really playable with four, definitely not with two, and solo play just doesn't properly work either. But, more motivation to invite friends, yay :)

RATING: 10
This is a deep assymetrical area control game with much character. Players play evil gods competing against each other to destroy humankind. The rules are simple but the gameplay is deep. The reason for this is that there are three scoring mechanisms: domination and ruination (each of which scores you VPs) and threat (dial advancement). You need to keep track of how everyone is doing on each of these levels, and make careful decisions accordingly. For example, it often pays to make short term sacrifices to prevent another player from making long term gains. Given the fluidity of the game this is easier said than done...and it can be difficult for new players to play at the level of the scoring rather than at the level of their plastic figures only. In other words, players should expect to stumble a few times as they figure out how to read the game and see enough of how it is developing that they can make well-timed interventions to help their own position and stop another player from winning. For these reasons I advise against playing this game with people who lack the focus to play a deep game, or who are easily discouraged.

Downtime is low, there is much direct conflict and interaction among players, there is a tremendous amount of thematic flavour, and the artwork and components are very well done.  See my [url=http://fortressat.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1466&Itemid=551]understated review at Fortress Ameritrash [/url] for a few more details.

[b]3 player game[/b]: With only 3 players, there is a bit more breathing space. The balancing act of the gameplay (where hindering the progress of other players ia just as important as advancing your own position) is a bit easier. It isn't as tense, but it still worth playing, and it is a good way to introduce the game to people who do not normally play boardgames.

Edit: okay this is a superior game,and unlike many other game sfrom FFG, is not overinflated.  This design is what I expect from modern ameritrash, i.e. theme, dice and conflict within a reasonable timeframe and with a balance between luck and skilled play, chrome and streamlining.
The graphical design of the game board is not flawless, some token are not contrasted enough against the board, apart from that Chaos in the Old World is a game close to perfect.

A satisfying game that is what it claims to be. Much better than Cyclades (which is a game I dislike a lot because of the out-of-control random factor). Played twice as Tzeentch and won in a margin both times in a three player game without Slaanesh. Not sure if it's because it's imbalance or my oponents didn't play it right. However I can still see that there might be some potential balance issues, and it seems like there is no mutiple paths to victory.

RATING: 7
The game has poor internal balance (non-choices in the upgrades and chaos cards). It would be cool if players could adapt to different situations by picking appropriate upgrades. Sadly, the best upgrade choices are the same every time. The upgrades become non-choices. Regarding the balance between the gods, at least the base game is pretty self-balancing once all the players understand how the different gods work.

Gripe: Why can Khorne get victory points if he can never win with them? Tracking victory points for Khorne feels like unnecessary busy work. The last dial tick bonuses for Nurgle are also unnecessary because he can never get them.

Dropped after 5 plays from 9 to 4.. you think it's ameritrash.. when it really is a middle-weight euro game.

_______________________

Asymetrical factions & dual winning paths are neat. I'm a huge fan of the warhammer universe! And the playing time is relatively short.

Well -2.5 after 3 plays. Still like the theme.. but it actually could have been anything.. and the mechanics are quite euroish.. e.g. counting VP's in every round.

Also at the end it's Leader-bashing time.. something i hate.. because no matter how good you played before, the person winning is usually the one who would have been second place.

When I first heard of this, I was turned off with the supposed theme. I vehemently dislike horror games--with it's emphasis on evil, and words like "Chaos" in the title, this smelled like another stupid zombie game. And being from FFG, the folks that brought you the nightmare that is Arkham Horror, well, I was more than reluctant to play this... but I had no choice; there were four of us, and as soon as this hit the table, the two newbies in the gaming group hit on it like vultures on a corpse.

Boy, was I surprised. Set in an alternate Warhammer 40K universe, you are in control of one of four demonic factions battling it out to corrupt the Old World. Each faction (actually power) has asymmetric powers, with a specialty that is reflected in its force mix, action cards, and game objectives. After awhile, this reminded me of Risk:2210 AD--area control, limited number of turns, special objectives, cards, and specialized units, except set in a fantasy setting. The game is not only about amassing units and moving around the board attacking and "killing" (which my faction specialized in and was rewarded for), but also laying down 'chaos' cards which can affect the play within region they are placed in. Whoever is able to amass enough units exceeding some threshold (unique for each region), gets VP equal to the threshold at the end of each turn (of six). Also, if they have cultists in the mix, they get to 'corrupt' the region. When a region gets twelve corruption tokens, players with the most corruption get mega VPs, and the region is out play for the rest of the game. All players, as a total, must corrupt at least five regions on the board by the end, or the game wins, so there is a slight cooperative aspect. Another novel feature is that each power has a status dial (kind of like from BSG), which increments as each power satisfies a unique condition of theirs, thereby getting upgrades and improved capabilities to their forces. (It's interesting to note that more games are starting to incorporate 'dials' directly into the board, e.g., BSG, Chicago Express. This must be a new trend, but it can be annoying as it takes up valuable table/board space.)

The components are standard FFG (which means lots of tiny counters), with thick cardboard, great graphics, and fantastic, yet flimsy, plastic figures. There aren't too many rules, and the list of actions each player can take is limited, but the strategic and tactical decisions are many. I agree with one of the reviewers that the board regions are tiny for the given number of units (and cards).

This is a surprisingly good game, albeit with a sinister, dark theme. If one is able to get into character, it's a rumpus good time, and the truly asymmetric powers/capabilities (we're talking nasty, one-sided, unfair) bring about surprises and upsets, as well as engaging gameplay that should remain fresh for a long time. Initial rating: '8'.

Update (09/27/11): Haven't played this since that first time, and only a few individuals have it. I don't think I'll go out of my way to get this. Downgrading it to a '7'.

[i]Whoa.[/i]

UPDATE:  After four "learning" games—separated by enough time to make the rules hazy, and with different players at each session—it's clear to me that this is only going to shine with complete knowledge of the various powers, and especially the contents of their decks.

On the one hand this suggests a huge amount of replay value—it would take at least four plays (once as each power) just to get to the starting point of deeper understanding—but in reality it's going to be difficult to string together connected plays with the same people in a culture where very few are interested in wearing a game out.

But I love the idea of this, the mythos and presentation, and so I must try...

The group are crazy about this one. I like it well enough. I guess if I had more attachment to the theme, it might be a must-by. As is, I am tempted to have it, but then it's a game that really needs four players, and by definition that's only ever going to be the group. Yeah, so two years on from that, I bought in. One of the two people in the group that owned a copy hasn't been seen lately. It's a good game, very balanced for exactly four.

I like this game, because to do well you constantly have to be thinking ahead a turn or two. If you like games that involve out-thinking, out-maneuvering, and misleading opponents, this is a solid 10. If I had the right group, this would be a 10 for me. However, this game does not appeal to the play style of my gaming group. That simplifies the metagame, turning this into a '9' for me.

RATING: 7
I quite like this game and generally won't turn down a play. It feels smoother and better designed than virtually every other Fantasy Flight game I've played. But there is something niggling that knocks it down a bit in my estimation.

Something about it just feels a bit scripted somehow. Maybe it because of how the chaos gods always need to focus on Populous regions or getting two kills or what have you. The gods themselves are asymmetric and done well but if I am randomly assigned Khorne then the game is about how well I can execute The Khorne Strategy rather than me coming up with my own strategy.

Great balanced asymmetric powers. Highly dynamic, interesting and still (after ~70 plays) different games. Also like the theme. Khorne is quite luck-based but it all comes down to intelligent risk management. Plays rather quick.

Update Oct 2015: downgraded a bit since Nurgle seems OP in the base game

RATING: 5
I'm not a big fan of area control games anyway but this one was frustrating. The dice can be hard on you and sometimes you are out of the game early on. Why continue? Some chaos cards are plain stupid, others quite powerful. I cannot see the balance here.

The design is ugly but I guess I'm just not familiar with the Warhammer cosmos?

I can see why some people have fun playing Chaos in the Old World, but the current rating I can see not. Maybe I need to play this more, but then again, I don't feel like I ever wanna.

Excellent blend of many Ameri-games elements including rich theme, area control, dice combat, diplomacy, combo card play and done so elegantly that it rivals the cleanliness of Euro-games. Asymmetric player powers and upgrades further extends re-playability because each is so different. Coupled with beautiful game pieces and you have a game that is as stunning to watch as it is to play.

If you didn't know the Warhammer back-story of the Ruinous powers, you will after this game. Aptly captures the bickering nature of Chaos gods and the carnage they spill into the mortal world in their timeless quarrel.

This game is great, it has a different feel depending on who you play, and all the roles are well balanced. Each time we play it is a close race and the old world deck is almost empty too so very well balanced. A wonderful mix of combat and area control, figures and cards from you hand, plus you get to upgrade and grow in power if your making dial clicks.

I particularly love 'event' cards in a game (here called Old World Cards) but I'm still a little concerned at the level of AP I've seen in some players.

Keen to play more & play with an experienced group.

I also find playing Khorne a little boring.

After testing the 3 player game with Auto-Khorne I think I nearly like that as much as the 4 player game!

RATING: 4
A ghastly Ameritrash game that depends entirely on the players understanding and monitoring what each of the others needs to do in order to win. Where players have different experience levels then the system crashes and burns completely. For example: Tzeentch scores for having two cultists in a region with two stones, Khorne gets points just for killing them (thereby both scoring and preventing Tzeentch from scoring!). So, who stops Khorne? The final nail in the coffin for me is that each of the factions is 'evil' and therefore it's impossible to sympathise with its objectives, so losing the attractive narrative that's an essential part of experience games. Not one for me.

Conflict heavy game with a theme for very specific tastes, yet with a lot of elements that strike me as very Euro.  There's a lot going on here and it can be frustrating trying to balance the various things you can do in a general Euro way while someone across the table has the opportunity to come in and destroy it all. I don't know; this may be a good game, but I didn't have a great experience.  Maybe I'll play it again, but I'm not excited about it. (1 play)

This game sounds awesome, and it's even better than that. Every decision you make is exciting, there's minimal bookkeeping, and the only bookkeeping generally reveals scoring so it's exciting.

RATING: 8
Played with 4 3 times. It was better, but that much. Still, a pleasant experience, would play again.
---
3 matches with 3 players. Third one was really crappy as Khorne got to place a couple of hero tokens with some others in the second round and the next round brought in Grail which decimated Nurgles chances of winning via ruining the center areas. The grail also hung around for a few more rounds. The rest was pretty much scripted as Khorned cruised to dial victory. 

Still, I'll want to try with 4. But pretty random, especially with the event cards.

Wow.  What a weird one.  My wife bought this for me on my birthday.  I mean, she went onto BGG knowing NOTHING about Warhammer and read all of the positive reviews for this game. Of all of the games in the top 50 she could have chosen, this was a strange one for her to decide on.

I myself would likely never have purchased this game. I am disenchanted with the 'Warhammer' brand name and 
the theme simply does not appeal to me.

Nevertheless, I'm happy she did.  The variety, replayability and options of victory are very rewarding.  Very elegant game and couldn't have been more surprised with how much I enjoy playing this.

I tend to like games that bring factions or sides with asymmetric abilities against one another.  Are all of these games perfectly balanced . . . probably not, but they make for good game experiences more often than not.

Feb10:

I'm two plays in. And right now, I'm pleasantly happy with my purchase. I think it packs an amazing amount of unique situations into a smooth package.

The four gods play drastically different. I played the control god super well and won as him. I played nurgle horribly and lost for it. But I want to play it again and play them *right*! I think that's the sign of a great game.

It's not that hard to explain. And the turns flow fast and the game wraps up before you know it.

I don't like some of the classic "stop him, he's going to win", but that's just the type of game it is, you can't actually avoid it.

The theme may turn some off, but I actually find it unique and refreshing. We constantly say we're "Pooping" corruption all over the map. The balance of Dial turns and Victory Points is just savory.

Jul10:  So once we got better at the gameplay... it turned into "Whack the leader."  That's not the type of game I actually enjoy all that much.

I went into this game with exceedingly low expectations.  But much to my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed COW.  The element that really shines is the very nicely balanced asymetry between the players.

This is the 2nd time I have seen Eric take an old design and redux it (see his Mystic game and AGOT-TCG) into something cool as to me this is Midgard revamped, rethemed and given a steroid injection for good measure.

Its a very cool AC variable power system with 4 different players potentially following different paths to win. There are lots of things to ponder and track here but I do share the concerns that you simply have to play to the power you are playing to win, its not like Khorne is going to win on VP's here. So while each one is different you likely have to play to its strengths to win limiting your viable "options" on how to play. So while with most good multiple path games you can choose to play different game each time here you will but only if you play a different faction (this is a very broad statement/generalization and I still do think there is some wiggle room inside your path like upgrades etc however see next sentence). More to this end I also shares John's concern that Slaanesh and Tzenteech may be more interesting to play overall than the other 2 factions which have an even more obvious path, more play is needed to know for sure if any of these concerns are true and how much. Even if true (depending how much), I still enjoy this kind of game and would enjoy testing out each faction and learning how to play well with each one and games will still feel somewhat different each time as it will depend on just how each player approaches the game. More to that end, it is [i]imperative[/i] that everyone at the table track each others progress and act accordingly, much more so than many other games. 

It seems they really did a good job with the theme. I also really liked the 2 card limit per territory and this added some tension/push your luck and made some decisions tough. Probably only going to play great with 4 though the expansion means you can play 5. I did find a little chaos (and luck) actually, not sure how much it bothers me yet but I think things are likely a little harder to control with 5 than 3 or 4.

I'm a big fan of this game.  Just a couple small things keep this rating from being higher.  I do not like the board.  It is hard to read, doesn't have room in important areas, and the colors make it easy to not see important pieces.  Also, small mistakes can essentially put you out of the game.  Love the asymetry.

Truly excellent.  Asymmetrical player powers that lead to one (or two) racing against the others on one victory path, or have all on one path.  While every side has its own ways to affect the board state to their advantage (or someone else's disadvantage).  With 3 victory situations and a time limit, it becomes a tense race to the end.

The asymetrical powers work wonderfully.  There's a queen/king making element towards the end - but strangely this is a plus, given the theme of gods assisting and betraying one another. 

The two negatives for me - 
The board is a murky mess (meant to represent human skin).  Some regions are too small to hold all the necessary pieces and the borders are difficult to distinguish plus it's a horrid sludge colour all over.
The 'Old World' cards can be an unnecessary random complication, when playing with those new to the game.

Area control game. Great scope for high player interaction and reversals. The cards and bonuses work well against each other. Manual contains suggestions for how players can best oppose each other; better if you discover that for yourself.

Initial Rating 5.0 (February 2012)

I have heard so many good things about this game, that when I finally played it, it was a disappointing experience. It is not a bad game, I believe my high expectation of the game killed it for me. I will play again but I will not pursue more plays of this even though I love majority games.

The miniatures are pretty cool as is the standard for a FF game. 

My main complaint is the game board, for me it is not clearly defined, many times (and this happened to at least 1 friend) I thought I wasn´t in a region, but actually, I was, also most of the upgrade cards won´t likely be played EVER as there are some of them that are clearly very good and a player will always choose them over the other ones. I like the idea of the game but something is missing from it, not sure what but I don´t enjoy it as much as I thought I would.

In an effort to follow the BGG rating system to the letter, I’m downgrading Chaos in the Old world rating from a 7.0 to a 6.0 as it is a game I would play sporadically but not one I want to usually play.

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 9
Played it only once, yet, but, wow, what an amazing game design!
It's marvelous to behold how the goals of the different factions interlock to achieve a balance. Despite one or the other faction being in the lead at some point in the game, when it actually ended, it was a very close affair.

RATING: 9
The whole proves better than the sum of its parts - I wouldn't have thought I'd end up liking an area control game with heavy doses of take-that gameplay.

The variable player powers make the game though, as well as keeping the take-that in check.  Since the players have fairly well-defined objectives take-that play is limited to getting someone out of one's way or trying to stop the win.  The game also doesn't overstay its welcome; we saw five ruinations very quickly.

There are some very interesting game-theoretical questions that this game has raised both times I've played it - mainly concerning the tightrope Tzeentch and Slaanesh have to walk keeping Khorne and Nurgle in check.  Definitely on my "games I need to play more" list.

Never was a fan of games with extreme direct conflict, but this one isn't too bad. There's something about it I really like. The different players, the different paths to victory, the system of balancing between hitting the leader and sneaking in a victory... it's a beauty.

An Ameritrash version of an area control Euro, which isn't all that bad.  Good game, like the variation in the cards for each GOD and different goals that are to be achieved.

Chaos in the Old World has a special place in my heart for being one of the first games that I bought "on my own" in the early years of my hobby. It's among the first (and still most significant) steps on my way to establishing a boardgaming identity of my own.

But that's not why it's a 9/10. The reason is that it's a really good, solid game. It's dripping with theme, the presentation is top notch, player interaction is furious, the pacing is excellent and it's generally really well balanced, although the randomized setups tend to favor some player roles more than others in each game. At its best, the game is extremely tight, usually with two players desperately struggling for victory neck and neck, both of them equally plausible winners at the beginning of what will turn out to be the last round of the game.

It's worth owning the Horned Rat expansion, because playing the game with the Morrslieb decks has a very different feel and role balance from the base game. I can't say which is "better", but that's probably a good thing, since neither deck feels like a downgrade from the other.

This is after one play: This seems to be a really well designed asymmetrical area control game. Each of the gods that you can play as feel pretty different in their play styles. The different powers and abilities are interesting and add to the flavor of the game. I'm guessing my opinion of this game will mostly go up, but I'm not sure an area control game is every likely to be a game that I want to play all the time.

RATING: 8
This is a very nice game, but it must be played only by four players. It's senseless with 3: if Khorn is in play, it has no chance to win other than a lot of luck, and if Khorn is out of Play, it's too boring. But don't get me wrong, this is an amazing game when played by 4. Its strategy is very deep.

Euro salad tossed in an Ameritrash dressing.

Chaos in the Old World is a majority game where scoring occurs on three levels: short term (domination), long term (corruption) and [i]cumulative[/i] (threat level). A simple Kramer-style action point allowance system provides the engine. Add to these very euro-style game design elements combat, variable player powers, random events, upgrades, and a hand of spell/influence cards and then you have a "special action" majority game (a la El Grande) taken to an extreme level. Although Kramer is not listed as a designer, this feels very much like a collaboration he might have done with Eric Lang.

And somehow, it all works! It is a beautiful, glorious, and thoroughly depraved mess of a game, while being quite lean by FFG standards. I am not a big fan of what we call Ameritrash games - the die rolling is tedious and most themes are meaningless to me - but one thing that I do appreciate are variable player powers that lead to variable strategies between players. I think this is one of the reasons I like Agricola so much, that the cards help to define a unique strategy that no other player will be pursuing in quite the same way. Well, color me surprised, but Chaos scratches a very similar itch for me that Agricola does. This is a game that truly bridges the gap between European- and American-style game designs.

As with all FFG games, this is hard to confidently rate after a single play because it takes time to figure out how balanced all of the special powers and cards are. It is definitely my favorite FFG game to date.

RATING: 7
The idea of CitOW really appeals to me: direct conflict, assymetrical powers. Every Chaos God plays differently, and for the game to be satisfying each player has to play close attention to the shifting balance of power. 

After one play, I can rate the game a solid seven with potential to go to an 8. I played as Khorne initially, and Khorne seems like a great idea in terms of game design (constantly attacking the other players, particularly the ones momentarily in good positions) but in practice he seems kind of boring to play. I'm not sure Nurgle would be much better - it really seems like the intriguing sides of the game are Slaanesh and Tzenteech. In a game with two potential runaways and two "back door victory" characters, the latter seems inherently more interesting to play. Might just be me. 

The gameplay seems functional but perhaps not more than that. Unit placement, movement, and differentiation meet minimum standards. Ditto cardplay: interesting but only just. And that might be fine once players reach a certain level of familiarity. If you can focus exclusively on the shifting balance of power and use the simple tools provided by the game, maybe it's pretty good. 

Best FFG game in a long time. In fact, probably one of their only good games. 

Update: after a second play, I'm not sure I see long-term prospects here. Maybe there's just too much system-fallout in this one for me. I'm starting to realize that I really dislike games that "check" various statuses and pull the associated tripwires.

Read the rules, looks like just the kind of area control game that I was looking for. Nice theme too : D

**Update** 
Plays very well - 90 minutes tops. After some confusion with Khornes dial advancement condition the game seems to be very well balanced. Each power plays very differently and all players need to be aware of the other players in order to keep everyone in check.

Really enjoy it and will see myself playing this a lot in the foreseeable future.

**Update** this is definately a beat your neighbor type game and can result in screwage - I enjoy that (if kept light - not all will though).

*Update** Has stood up to repeated play - i'm still rubbish at it though!

**Update 29th Oct 09** Like this so much I got El Grande in a trade (which also looks exciting after a rules read).

I Like: 
*Variable player powers mean a new game every time.
*Varied strategies for each power - last game Khorne was 3VP off a VP win!
*Plays very well with 3 or 4 players, which surprised me.
*Great theme!
*Play time of just over an hour with 3 players.
*Having your own deck of cards to play - I really like this mechanic.

Dislike:
*The board is poorly laid out. This has stopped bothering me due to familiarity but 1st couple of games was a definite issue.
*This is the type of game where someone who doesn't 'play their own game' can arbitrarily ruin someone elses game.

A solid game.

I have to say that I am impressed with how balanced the powers seem to be.  In the games I have played, everyone has been in the running up until the last two turns.

One complaint I have heard is that each game round takes progressively longer.  If you feel like you have no chance at winning, then I can see how the last round can be a bit like water torture.

RATING: 8
Wonderfully asymmetric, easy to teach and plays in a reasonable amount of time.  A good solid design with a lot to offer.  Everyone's always been able to pick the game up fast when I've taught it.  Primary downside for me is it shares the typical multi-player emphasis on trying to make sure you're not the one in the cross hairs when it comes time to kill the leader.  Also, there is a whole layer of meta-strategy which will not be apparent to players until they are more familiar with the decks and dials possessed by each of the ruinous powers.

RATING: 7
The Warhammer universe couldn't be further away from my gaming preferences but I enjoyed this game. Sure, it is multiplayer conflict, dice can play a decisive role and it depends on players keeping each other in check. But it strikes the right balance with area majority scoring, strategic possibilities and tactical optimizations to make it work as a Weuro - a genre I usually don't enjoy too much (Antike or Struggle of Empires, to name games where the balance isn't right for me).
In my one game I played Khorn who feels like the odd one out being the only faction who doesn't need to corrupt something on the board and just has to kill others. Coupled with the playstyle of my group that they only fought against Khorn and expected Khorn to do the dirty work of fighting to keep all others in balance at the same time, this isn't the best faction to play.

A Euro-esque area-control game disguised as an Ameritrash game. Variable powers, good use of theme, and interesting mechanics make this a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is as close to the perfect asymmetric area control game as I've ever seen.  It's also the only game in my collection that's almost always fun whether you win or lose because if you're on the losing end you can still "do stuff" and affect the outcome.  After playing too many "down and out" games, this was refreshing.

I'd have given this a 10 but for one issue:  the whole experience is so taut, dependent on all players to play their sides well, that games involving players with varying skill levels can often end up skewed; this often means you can play really well but still end up behind the 8-ball.  Chaos, it certainly is.

I thought this would be kind of nutty, but it's really pretty much an orderly, Euroish game with admittedly some decent take-that. The board is horrific, and not in the "Oh, my God, is that human skin?" but in the "Oh, shit, I can't really figure out what links to what." The text on the tiny cards is printed on an artsy background, which made it almost impossible for me to read in modest light. Gameplay is easy enough to get down, there's some OK asymmetry, and at least our game was fairly close. (I ended up missing a VP win by one point, then ended up third the next turn.) I can't say I really felt like a chaos god, though; I felt more like an optimizer. Some complaints were heard among my fellow players about a lack of balance in the gods, which I can't attest to myself, and I doubt I'll play it enough to ever find out--though I wouldn't turn down a game if asked and there were no obvious alternatives.

I should say that I have little to no appreciation for the theme, which for most people seems to be a main attraction, but the positive buzz on BGG got me interested in the game.

I like the asymmetrical powers, though hope they're not too scripted.  It does seem like you do need to play "right" in order to not let one player run too far ahead.

I like that the play time is manageable, especially for a game in which die rolls play such an important role.  I would like to play further, with a possibility of raising my rating.

One of the best asymmetric games out there with amazing balancing at least regarding the base game. Still have to play a few more games with the Horned Rat to see if that still holds up, since the expansion seemed broken to me in its first two plays.

Oozingly thematic, asymmetrical but balanced, one of the best games I've played but a hard four players is necessary (no Khorne is a runaway Nurgle win and Khorne without a third counterbalance is Khorne win, in my experience).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Extremely quick playing, asymmetric, old school euro area control game with light take that elements. You are controlling areas to cumulate your power and enough total power triggers big scorings. A splendid choice for four players, with three there is too much room on the map. I really like the aesthetics and flavor of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game mechanics take a little acclimation and there are a number of pesky rules, but all in all it isn't too onerous. The challenge comes in trying to understand which strategy works best with the god you are playing. Four gods, four very different approaches to game play. This is actually a good thing, but leads to a steep learning curve to suss out the proper approach. It also appears one of the gods has a distinct advantage, although that is debatable. And the more I play, the more I like it.

All hail! This is getting a much-coveted 9 in my book, and I wouldn't be shocked if it became a 10. Extraordinarily well-designed. I love how perfectly it works despite (because of?) the asymmetry. Just a brilliantly balanced system. This is only after one three-player game sans Khorne, mind you.

My only real complaint is the ass-ugly board. Yes, yes, it's human flesh, effing WHO CARES. I would've preferred a less thematic map with clearer borders. Just a minor quibble.

Four out of five games have been won by Khorne. We enjoy the game but as Khorne as won with 4 different people it raises the question of balance. I don't think we are playing the other Gods badly, but am worried that unless we find a way of stopping the Khorne attack with everything every turn option then a dial win is inevitable at least 75% of the time. Even having all the 3 other gods all work against Khorne fails to stop him, no matter who plays the god.

Probably tough for new players, though, as many of the strategies to win are delicate and can be surprising if this game's appearance of combat-heaviness (it's not at all - except for one player) deceives new players. I've only played it once but I have a feeling the subtleties of its obvious robustness will rise in the fullness of time.

RATING: 5
Based on one five-player game.  This is in a category that I call "Risk-like" games which expand beyond the idea of Risk and are generally better.  They include Vinci and Small Worlds.  Chaos isn't a bad game but I can't get excited about it despite coming in first place as Nurgle.  Probably because the whole "fantasy" or "other world" theme just isn't something that excites me.  My interests are more real world or history based which is why if I wanted to play this type of game I would choose Vinci.  Yes, I'm sure there are differences other than theme but nothing that really grabbed me.  I would play this again but would prefer to play something else.  I'm indifferent.

RATING: 9
This game reminds me of an asymmetric Nexus Ops, and, maybe for that reason, I like it a little more. The strategy variation between roles, varied win conditions, and theme all make this a fun game. The majority of our games we have played have been close, which is exciting. Really best with 4 players.

Note: I personally love the theme, but not all of the people in our play group are excited to play as daemons on a map that looks like skin (quote: "gross"). YMMV

It's THE game we play all the time. Excellent strategy game and with the expansion it becomes very deep and all gods can win in different ways.

In my opinion, the absolute best area control game.  Beautifully balanced once you get the hang of the different sides which are wildly diverse, full of 'fuck you' moments (I hear Norsca is lovely this time of year..) and just gets better with the very reasonably priced expansion.

[i]Chaos in the Old World[/i] sat on my shelf for some time before Brent Lloyd offered to teach my learning game.  What an excellent experience.

Chaos w starym świecie to jedna z najlepszych dostępnych na rynku gier strategicznych. Jest to jedna z moich ulubionych gier. Wykonanie jest świetne, jedynym minusem są "słoneczka" kultystów, które prędzej czy później odczepią się. Mimo to gra odwdzięcza się wspaniałymi emocjami przy stole. Rywalizacja potęg jest wyczuwalna, a fakt, że fabularnie bogowie chaosu nienawidzą się, wyklucza współpracę :-) Mimo to negatywna interakcja nie boli. Fakt, że z rozgrywki na rozgrywkę, gracze stają się bardziej świadomi swoich (bóstw) mocnych i słabszych stron. Balans gry jest wręcz nieprawdopodobny, każda potęga ma realne szanse na zwycięstwo. Losowość, która w grze występuje w walce (rzuty kośćmi), dociągu kart chaosu, oraz wydarzeniach, nie jest dokuczliwa. Fakt, czasami dane wydarzenie daje korzyści jednemu z bóstw, ale nie są to często korzyści, których nie da się zablokować. Złożoność zasad jest pozorna, nowi gracze, którym tłumaczę grę przez 10-20 minut, załapują sens już w 2 rundzie. Grę gorąco polecam!

Ohhh... I love this game. I LOVE it!
It's always so close and you can loose on the turn you thought you won. You have to keep an eye on points, the board and the "wheels" all at the same time, because everything can finish the game. This mechanics plus the fact that all four gods have a different feel how they are played and also different goals let this one shine (at least for me...)

Some games, different setups of races, 3-4 players, just base game.
Spectacular game with a modern design, being hybrid of genres like area control, war and ameritrash. Phases and mechanics are well-matched and make for variety of ways to play your turn, which all might change due to dynamic situation on board. Theme of fantasy, corrupted gods is very strong and unique but what's important, it firmly captures characteristics of the whole gameplay where you try to outsmart, deceive and crush your oponents. Without much dwelling, balance is fairly good, but it is preferred to play with advanced gamers.

[9.0/10]
After several (5) games, my enthusiasm has waned somehow (as is often the case). 
I still really like the game, but it does suffer from an inherent flaw - the upgrade card balance. Some upgrade cards are so powerful, that they funnel players into following a similar development path each game. It does limit the replayability a great deal, and sadly the expansion's attempt at fixing it ends up totaly flattening faction asymmetry.

With every game CitOW gets better and better. 
It has it's limitations - it was made for 4 players, and 4 players only - but within those limitations it shines brighter than any game I've yet to play.
Every game is tight, tense and engaging. Strongly recommended to have a dedicated group.

The maps itself is horrible, I had to create and/or order custom version of every cardboard component so that everything fits withing the borders and tokens don't blend in with the background.

Sin duda, uno de los mejores juegos que ha visto la luz últimamente: la temática es potente y mucho más motivadora que criar cerdos o mover cubitos. Los materiales son una gozada: el tablero es precioso en su macabra concepción, las cartas texturizadas, las minis cumplen con su cometido y, sin ser maravillosas, son bastante decentes. Las ruedas del Caos, flipantes. Las peculiares características  de cada dios y sus distintos caminos para conseguir la victoria hacen que jugar con cada uno de los Poderes del Caos sea una experiencia de juego absolutamente distinta. Y más aún: la forma aleatoria en que las fichas de piedra, nobles, héroes y demás se distribuyen al comienzo de la partida pueden también forzar estrategias distintas;  y el hecho de usar siete cartas de entre todas las disponibles (28) para determinar los distintos eventos que tendrán lugar a lo largo de la partida, hacen que cada partida no tenga nada que ver con la anterior, ni aún jugándola con el mismo dios.

Por tanto: rejugabilidad brutal, con temática atrayente, interacción y puteo, estrategia, poco azar = JUEGAZO.

A suprisingly dull game. Looking at the box/theme/board/minis you should be expecting a good fun fight filled little game but... well, maybe it is for 1 of the players. the other 3 are playing a very simple but long and fiddly euro game. 

If you play the red guy - attack the 'leader' and try to roll high. If you are the other 3 - avoid the red guy and try to convince him that someone else is winning.

I've played this a few times and others really like it but i must admit it doesn't do a lot for me - seems like a game that does a few different things but doesn't do any of them very well. Also, the end turns into one of the worse cases of everyone saying "right, we all need to stop xxxx or he will win next turn"...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but I'm put off by the imagery and concept of the theme. Ordinarily it wouldn't bother me, but this one does. Nothing against it - I hope people enjoy it for what it is - a well designed area-control game with moderate wargame mechanisms, but not for me.

03-23-2015 - One play in.  I kind of love it and hate it.  The theme is extreme and bloody, and so is the interaction between players (easy to disrupt someone's hard laid plans).  It was fun and interesting, but also frustrating and stressful.  Not sure it's my bag, we'll see.  7 for now.

Four asymmetric yet balanced factions in a world too small for them? Yes, please.

It's such a tight design, up until the very last turn anyone can win. 4 completely different 'gods' (five with the Horned Rat), but perfectly balanced against each other.

I have no knowledge of the Warhammer universe, but in the end it didn't seem necessary to enjoy the game.

The pieces are standard FFG: high quality and beautiful imagery. It takes a bit to get used to the directional arrows, but they trace out a path that is identical every game, so eventually you just know where they point.

The interactive and strategic level of the game is quite enjoyable. You only get a limited number of points to deploy either troops or ability cards. Cultist troops cannot battle enemy troops but they can corrupt the board, which can net you huge points if you're persistent.

Having a point-based victory condition is all well and fine, but FFG, staying true to form, added a non-point victory condition for each player, as well as a way that all players can lose. This feature alone makes the game extremely interesting. Also, having a feature that gives an edge to the player in last place is a mechanic I can get behind.

Just about the only problem I have with this game is the level of randomness associated with the battle dice (and also how they only include 5 dice in the set), but sometimes these can make for the best stories afterward.

RATING: 9
Upon additional plays, I have come to the conclusion that this game is very unforgiving. The game is fast-paced, with no down-time, which is an asset but it leaves no time to correct any mistakes... as long as it's played with experienced players, a definite "always want to play"...

Chaos in the Old World makes you a god. Each god’s distinctive powers and legion of followers grant you unique strengths and diabolical abilities with which to corrupt and enslave the Old World.

• Khorne, the Blood God, the Skulltaker, lusts for death and battle. 
• Nurgle, the Plaguelord, the Father of Corruption, luxuriates in filth and disease. 
• Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, the Great Conspirator, plots the fate of the universe. 
• Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure and Pain, the Lord of Temptations, lures even the most steadfast to his six deadly seductions.

The thematic expression is a shame, as it cuts out a fair number of potential players (yes, not everyone likes game boards that look a little like reorganized vomit and enjoy playing with demonic cultists), but when you get down to it with people who enjoy and know it that fades into the background, and the clever area control and cardplay comes to the fore.

One of the few games I've gotten rid of, despite nothing else of its type being better.

I will rebuy a new edition if FFG does one.

Great game! Clever design, fun interaction and talking across the table. Specially love how very different the Powers are, and the balance is impressive! 

The dice-based battle mechanic is exciting and luck plays a big role, but the strategic summoning phase is much more important. Old World cards are very powerful and game changing. Components are beautiful, the only downside is the board is confusing, badly distributed and looks meh, could be much better. 

This game keeps me on the edge of my seat like no other I own.

RATING: 7.5
Possibly my favorite wargame.  Each player has different objectives and incentives to compete for overlapping territories.  Multiple paths to victory, reasonable length, good interaction, more to consider than just simple attrition (aka Risk) yet simple and steamlined play.  And of course, the theme permeate everything and is simply awesome.  My only complaint, which is expecting with a completely asymmetrical setup, is balance: I've never seen Nurgle win, Korn is very easy to win with 4 players, Slanesh is easy with 3 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
To summarize the concept of this game I would say that it is El Grande with cooler stuff. Its basically an area of majority game with more special abilities and neat things.

It is not horrible but there are a few things I don't like.

First, you have so few cards in your hands, I would have preferred to draw 3 or 4 cards every turn instead of 2. More cards is not bad for the game considering you have to pay for them and that there is a limited amount that can be placed on the board.

Second, the dials are interesting but many effects are useless. Gaining power ups that way is OK and ingenious. but some levels only makes you game VP or remove tokens from the board. Totally useless. Give be bonus troops, bonus corruptions, more mana, but actually give me something worth leveling up.

Third, the map is very hard to read. Yes it is cool, but there are too much colors and it is hard to identify the stuff on the board. It is even hard to see the borders of the regions. So I really think they should have redesigned the colors of the map.

If you love area majority games with some variety and replay value, that might be the game for you.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
I never understood the fuss around this game until I played or saw many other games similar to this game. The reason Chaos is so popular is because all the other games sucks. I have played Cthulhu Wars who has similar mechanism, and I prefer Chaos by far.

So even if I have a lot of issue with this game, it is the best game in it's category. So if you like this kind of game, you might just take this one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
LIKE:

* The asymmetrical abilities of the four different evil gods as well the different set of cards for each leads to interesting conflict and pursuit of two different victory conditions.
* Having a couple different viable winning conditions keeps you on your toes and you must work together to keep the leaders down in their respective categories.
* Corruption is an interesting piece to bring about ruination and potentially more points.  
* Heroes, nobles, magic, and other chits bring in a variable starting board and an everchanging board.
* Despite the fact that my forces were continually destroyed by a hot hand with dice, I do like that aspect that you hit with and reroll and die that rolls a 6...giving you potential to destroy a lot of opponents.  

DISLIKE:

* I have a strong aversion to the dark theme and art of this game.  My preference would be a different setting/context.
* I'm not certain dice rolls will even out over the course of a game.  This is a game that needs this to occur, but I can live with dice, just can be frustrating.
* Can't say I'm a fan of having the attacker decide what he destroys from defensive forces.  However, that might be necessary in this game to maintain game balance.  Still, it just grates me the wrong way.

[b]**Biggest Disapointment in Gaming - 2009**[/b]

This is an example of how I feel about where FFG seems to be going with their new games, it's just bloated. The mechanics all work with each other (i.e. this does this, and this. That does that and that, and this and that worked together in such a way......). The design seems convuluted and frankly just useless. The miniatures in the game look great, but are very brittle (a number of pieces at the GenCon demo tabled I played out had broken pieces, especially the cultist pieces).  The artwork, especially the board is very evocative to the Warhammer universe, but the board itself is a mess to read, and is WAY too busy.  If you are a big fan of the Warhmmer mythos you will probably enjoy this one, but if you aren't (like me) I would say just avoid it.

A combination European-Ameritrash game with area control and combat, set in the weirdo Warhammer universe I don’t care anything about. You play the role of evil gods bent on destruction, carving a path of misery across a doomed world. Each god has his own goal and path to victory, and it seems like a big, stupid mess but the result is gloriously fun. I love the application of the theme on this one. It teaches and plays very quickly, but looks like there are a lot of angles to try out. A nice mixture of strategy and conflict, and the (admittedly slightly) different goals keep things fresh. A real winner.

"Your shrines will burn, your streets run with blood, your false idols shattered, your people slaughtered by the thousands, your very planet torn apart… and the barest fraction of my hatred will be satisfied." sums up the games theme. :D

RATING: 7
My one game of this lasted 3 hours but I am assuming that is usually not the case, and so my rating reflects if this game is normally 2 hours or less (otherwise this goes down to a 6).

I definitely see a lot of things in this game that were later implemented in Blood Rage: action points with you taking one action per turn until you are out of action points with the points being used to deploy units and play various cards, having possible upgrades to your action points and units, area control, areas of the board that get blown up, order of how you perform your actions being very important, plays best with 4, possibly have runaway leader problem, and very different ways you can win.

Difference between players: The greatest strength of CitOW compared to Blood Rage is definitely the assymetric factions that all play very differently. The red race wants to kill enemy units and has the easiest time winning via fulfilling their track, green likes to spread around the board and likes to win via VPs, purple mind controls opposing units and can win via either way, and blue has a much stronger access to their utility cards and also can win either way. While I'm not sure if it has as much replayability as the Blood Rage draft (where even if you go for a general strategy you can draft slightly different cards each round), I felt much more different than Blood Rage would even if players drafted very different play styles.

Units: I like how each unit has different stats in Chaos in the Old World for different players. While I think technically you have more eventual customization options in Blood Rage, the immediate difference and the special powers being more special in CitOW still makes it win this category for me.

Area control: It is much easier to move around in Blood Rage as you can move a group at a time, and don't have to deploy adjacent to previous units. This also means in Blood Rage you can't get stuck in a corner as easily with a difficult time to fight your way through to spread across the board. However I think this makes positioning more important in CitOW especially with the added counters on the board, and also I like how you both need to consider corruption tokens and also #units + cards played in each region rather than just overall strength as in Blood Rage.

Combat: This is where Blood Rage shines the best. The single card combat is both clean and strategic. In comparison, the large amounts of die rolling in CitOW is fairly luck based and has a bit of downtime. While in theory it is cool to have the slightest of chances your single unit can wipe out a huge army, overall CitOW's combat system seems dated.

Progression: I think Blood Rage has a significantly better progression, as while you start more similar there are more avenues you can expand with the different cards each round. This is despite the greater control of what region blows up in CitOW and the event cards being different each time gives a sort of board progression in that game.

Victory Conditions: CitOW seemingly has much greater difference in its victory conditions as in Blood Rage you can only win via points, but the thing is both the wheel and VPs generally still require you to get area control, and so you still strive for the same general objective. In comparison, in Blood Rage the Loki cards encourage you to actively lose by spreading yourself thin, there are some stat boosting cards that incentivize you to be off on your lonesome to poach pillage rewards, and there is the general strategy of getting into the thick of fights.

Thematic Flair vs. Streamlining: This I think should overall be what ultimately decides which game you should get. There are much more unique cards in CitOW whereas a lot of cards in Blood Rage are just variations of each other or are pretty generic (e.g. increased strength, yellow vs. blue region quests, generic stat boosts). However, Blood Rage's generic nature also makes the flow of play much more smooth as while there are still tough decisions each turn, the ramifications of each are less convoluted. It also makes Blood Rage quite a bit easier to learn I believe. Overall, while I really like the assymmetry and thematic flair of CitOW, I like Blood Rage more because of its streamlined nature, superior battle system, and the fact that I prefer Norse mythology to a random made up one (but thank you Eric Lang for still making more mythology games, creating a cool universe, and not doing another Greek mythology one).

It's probably great, but to understand the game you need to play it few times with the different races so you know what you can expect. Compared to Blood Rage, where the drafting mechanics allow to understand the possible strategies other player will do since first playthough.

Good thematic game. All the mechanism meshes really well with the "Godly" theme. Some really nice ideas in the game: the power cards, gods with different powers, the "dials" with special rewards, nice combat mechanims, different unit with different powers, some units with upgrades, different victory conditions... the list goes on!  

I am not sure that all gods are really well balanced though but it is still a blast to play!

After my first play,  really enjoyed this game. I played as Khorne and lost based on dice rolls!  Even still, it was amazingly fun and I really enjoyed the asymmetric gods.  Each god felt unique and distinct.  Lots of fun!

Preliminary rating with "wrong" rules and extended playtime due to newbieness. If playtime drops the rating is sure to rise.

Update:

Playtime dropped to 60 minutes or less. The game is just so thought provoking, filled with conflict and chances to feel clever.

Update:

Continued play, continued fun.

Chaos in the Old World delivers conflict and tense game play with terrific character. Each Chaos god has a unique and noticable style and winning condition, and it contributes to games which are almost always very close. Components-wise, this is the first time that the half-size cards actually make sense in a game, since they get played directly onto the board. There is the inevitable problem with cultist staffs as well as misprints on some of the character sheets, but apart from that, the game ships beautifully.

Really fun game, with good asymmetric powers.  Unfortunately, our gaming group only has 3 who can play this, and I would love to try it 4 or 5 player.  Even with 3 it is fun.  

I like playing it, but don't think I would ever buy it because the dark theme would limit the number of people I could introduce to the game.....which is a shame.

RATING: 7
 Euro-style influence and AT-style confrontation (and dice!). I liked the different styles of the different factions and I likely got a tame taste as our events were decidedly a non-factor. Plus it was 3 player, when what I read later was 4 was better. So I ought to try this out again some time, especially as I left it with a generally positive impression.

RATING: 9.2
This game is my gateway game. I played it over 50 times, often with the same people.
It's really amazing - you get to be the Chaos Gods from Warhammer Fantasy and you get to destroy the Old World. The game is asymmetric and offers two different ways to achieve victory.
The main weakness of this game is that it becomes unbalanced if one or more players are inexperienced. You can still enjoy it, but for a tight game everybody should have played 3+ games.
Should you however get that veteran gaming group together you can expect extremely tight games, where typically 3 out of 4 players have a chance to win in the last round.

RATING: 5
I like the game, and the different strategies available. However, one downside is that you are really limited to which strategy you will used based strictly on the character you are playing. This could potentially lead to a stale game, unless consistently updated with expansions. The game has misprints and fragile minis, I will not rate above a 5 until FFG creates a new edition that addresses these major problems.

RATING: 5
This is a terrible game for anyone who doesn't want to have a cutthroat PVP experience from the get go.  Additionally if there is anyone at the table who has more experience with the game, and gods forbid you have a new player or two in the mix ... the game is going to suck.  Once players know all the cards in the four factional decks and have five or six games under the game gets better. 

It just doesn't have enough variability to be worth playing over and over.  I can see it being a game you play several times to learn, then a few times once you really have the strategy of the game down, then get bored quickly only playing it once or twice a year after that point.  There is a single expansion for it with really probably no potential to expand it more beyond that. 

I'd recommend it to any Warhammer Fantasy fans out there who don't happen to own it yet, but if one isn't in that camp there is no reason to buy this pretty forgettable game.  The only reason it has as high a ranking as it does here on boardgame geek is the legions of GW fanboys who blindly snap this stuff up and then gush about it no matter how good or bad it is.

A funny mix of different mechanisms. The variable powers and advancements made this game highly replayable. My only worry is that the power balance may not be that good if not played with full 5 players (with the expansion), as from my only game that Slannesh (pleasure, that's me) was kept being killed by Khorne player, and made the Nurgle player win.

Rated 4 after two games, where we had some rules problems, because "someone" don't know how to edit rules.

We will try again with the real rules, but I doubt it will ever catch me for real.

3rd game was really good! So now it's raised to 6.

Some games later it remains a 6. When mechanical unbalances have to be compensated by player actions (ganging up and such), I never really like it.

Was very popular in my gaming group for quite some time due to the mix of area control long-term strategy, short-term tactics, direct interaction, player differentiation and got over-played as a result.

An OK experience, but not much of a game. It gives the illusion of strategic choices. But these are really decided by the character you play, so it's just die rolls and bash the leader. Fun a couple of times, but not much reason to replay it.

This is one of the best games I have ever played, and played it I have. Many, many times. This is not a rating based on the initial excitement, I have scrutinized this game brutally and it has held wonderfully; to this day I enjoy playing it. The different kinds of demon hordes are very well balanced and I have witnessed each one winning in the course of consecutive games albeit some more than others. Dice odds to score a hit are 50/50 on a single die (which is often more than one die, specially with Khorne, and in most relevant situations one hit is one kill) which I absolutely approve of and prefer over 2 in 6 chance of success. If this game was anything less than 9, the expansion would have made it a 9. Highly recommended for everyone to play at least one game.

[Played once]
Asymmetrical wargame with area majority, action points, cards with different effects and multiple paths to victory.
Battles are resolved with a die roll (simple but random), cards aren't equally useful, the asymettry suggests that each faction has a favoured path to victory (so while there are many, they are far from equally viable... it is not that different from just having different objectives in Risk!).

Chaos in the Old World makes you a god. Each god’s distinctive powers and legion of followers grant you unique strengths and diabolical abilities with which to corrupt and enslave the Old World.
    Khorne, the Blood God, the Skulltaker, lusts for death and battle.
    Nurgle, the Plaguelord, the Father of Corruption, luxuriates in filth and disease.
    Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, the Great Conspirator, plots the fate of the universe.
    Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure and Pain, the Lord of Temptations, lures even the most steadfast to his six deadly seductions.
Yet, as you and your fellow powers of Chaos seek domination by corruption and conquest, you must vie not only against each other, but also against the desperate denizens of the Old World who fight to banish you back to the maelstrom of the Realm of Chaos.

Eric Lang is a designer whose involvement in a game always makes me sit up and take notice, even with projects like Quarriors that would not have been of that much interest to me without him on board. A game built around the chaotic gods of the Old World, one of my favorite aspects of the Warhammer Fantasy background, would have been enticing enough without him, but became an insta-buy once I spotted his name in the previews.

And the game did not disappoint and continues to be one of my favorites from recent years. The core mechanic of an area majority game where the contested areas are destroyed by the players as they go along is both a delightful fit thematically and an interesting new strategic dynamic. Putting individual victory conditions on top of that cake increases the thematic depth and the asymmetry of the four factions, and additionally prevents the game from becoming stale by providing different ways to the top of the god heap.

The many interconnections of cultists, areas and the chaos wheels are a delight once you’ve sorted them out, but they cause one of the two slight problems with the game: it sets up a rather fragile balance that can be tipped by a single inattentive or inexperienced (or, possibly, plain dumb) player. Keeping the other powers in check is sometimes more important than advancing your own plans, and this can be difficult to wrap your head around. The other problem of only working properly with exactly four players is forgivable and partly remedied by the Horned Rat expansion, which allows rousing five player games.

I like this one.  However, I feel like I'll have limited opportunities to get it to the table since it is best with 4.  If we have exactly 4, there are so many other games we would pull out instead.  This isn't one that I can teach and walk away from so it doesn't work well when we split into groups, either.  Would still like to play it a few more times.  Maybe it'll convince me its worth keeping just for occasional play.

A decent area control game, which has been made too full of exceptions and unintuitive rules. Kingmaking seems to be an issue as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The theme fits what Warhammer fans expect, and the game mechanics can be interesting. However, depth is missing in this game: 
Each faction essentially only has one way to play it, and at most times the options are limited. 
For a game that takes that long there are much better choices with more tension and complexity.

I really like the area control mechanic in CitOW. The domination/ruination of the regions is a very refreshing take on a very old concept. The game is a blast to play.

If something bad had to be sayed, the casting costs of some of the chaos cards are too high and the upgrades feel a bit scripted. Also, in a newbie group the Khorne player has some advantage over the other gods because the basic Khorne strategy (kill everyone) can be executed pretty efficiently by just summoning fighters to the most crowded regions. It gets more difficult when all players know how to deal with Khorne.

I love this game, despite my inability to win (barring a first-time surprise Nurgle victory).

Each time I finish, I look back and can see (in hindsight) what went wrong and when.  Given the amount of theme and randomness involved (cards/dice/other players), I realize that ultimately I had missed opportunities, created the wrong incentives for my opponents, or underestimated the risks of my positioning.

Only downside is need for exactly four players, and the difficulty of reading key information on the board.  (though the board itself is very appropriate to the theme.)  A lesser downside is the fiddliness of the tokens, especially corruption.  (the source of at least 3/4 of my oversights).

RATING: 9
A great game set in the Warhammer Fantasy universe wherein up to four players (five with the expansion) play the Gods of Chaos battling for dominion in the war-ridden lands of the Old World.
Whether you're playing the evasive Slaanesh, the unpredictable Tzeentch, the in-your-face Khorne, or the contagious Nurgle makes a huge difference in how you're going to play the game, with different units, upgrades, and power cards all unique to each faction, and players will find themselves enjoying the game more or less according to which power they incarnate. This is where the game really shines in my opinion, as people in the same game group will find their preferred playstyle and will also learn what their enemies can do, making the game incredibly deep and strategic.

Played once with four players. You have to keep track of what the goals of your other opponents are and make it harder for them to achieve them. If you just focus on your own objectives, it could cost you the game.

4 / 5 - Very Good

Very good indeed, with a fantastic balance of strategy and (appropriately enough) chaos. It's fairly (not completely) balanced but has such huge asymmetry in the player powers that this is actually a fairly impressive achievement. It's a highly procedural game that has to be followed to the letter, which is kind of a bind, but it's difficult, exciting, competitive and tense and the theme sucks you in to the point where it can feel marginally uncomfortable when you start ruining regions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Excellent, asymmetrical area control game with strong theme and neat twists. One of my all-time favourites which only gets better with more plays, though I'll admit I may have 'plateaued' with it of late. The upgrade cards are weak (you'll pick the same ones each time) but this remains the best title that Games Workshop never made.

So far this game is sitting at the top of my list. I love how each player has their chance to win but in a different way. you have to become your god and think like your god to win. its a well balanced game for the most part. And it's just dripping with theme!

Update: I've recently downgraded the rating on this game. The first few plays I really enjoyed it but after more plays, it really requires a group of people willing to police each other and when not played with that type of group, it's just not nearly as much fun. Plus the overabundance of wins by Nurgle doesn't help. Needs some balance

Update: The Horned Rat expansion really does a very good job of eliminating the imbalance of Nurgle. Not sure if it created another imbalance. Need to play a few more games with the expansion to see
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very neat combination of hard-core area control game with direct combat and a great theme. Can be a bit delicate - negotiation and communication among the players, especially the non-Khorne players, is absolutely essential.

Slaanesh - 4
Khorne - 3
Tzeentch - 0
Nurgle - 1

I have a biased perspective, as my view of this game suffers from a comparison to Blood Rage, which I see as a vastly superior game.

While I like the theme, the idea of strongly asymmetric powers, and the nice domination/corruption/ruin means of gaining points, most of the mechanisms disappointed me to some degree:

1) Dice combat is super swingy here, with the extra rolls on 6s, few diced used in combat, and each roll being critical.

2) Random card draws from only about 8 different cards gives little variety, particularly when many of the cards (and upgrades) are situational or almost useless.

3) Asymmetric game play is nice in theory, but you still need a way to have multiple paths to victory, which this game mostly doesn't have. Lang tried with the VP vs. dial advancement thing, but let's face it, Khorne doesn't win on VP and Nurgle doesn't win on the dial. The asymmetry here makes the game very scripted.

4) Card play is very take that - it's not fun or creative.

All this combines to create a game that requires you to play a scripted, bash the leader game, where the winner is the person who either rolls best or gets the least take that cards thrown at them.

Très asymétrique (force à jouer d'une façon) mais nos choix sont beaucoup conditionnés par les événements et les choix des autres joueurs, donc ça compense beaucoup le côté jeu orienté.
Khorne doit faire la police pour éviter qu'un joueur ne s'envole vers la victoire. En même temps tout le monde essaie de le fuir. Difficile d'arrêter Khorne s'il est seul en position de gagner à part en réussissant à fuir encore ou en priant qu'il rate ses attaques. On peut augmenter ses chances de survie en l'affrontant pour tuer ses guerriers.
Khorne est le moins subtile à jouer et donc peut être le moins intéressant ?

Dommage que chaque divinité ne puisse pas prétendre gagner sur les 2 fronts (points ou roues).
Jusqu'à présent on n'a pas réussi à gagner avec Tzeentch. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An awesome game with incredible theme, great area control play with asymmetrical powers.  The different powers and mechanics in the game can take a few plays to get the hang of but new players can join more experienced groups by starting off as Khorne.

A lot of depth hidden under the surface, and it is great exploring the different ruinous powers and their unique play styles.   

I really, really, really liked this game after just one 3 player game, rating it 8.5.  It is easily a 9 now, and could go higher - especially now that I have found a group that enjoys playing it (the theme can be confronting for some).

Finally got the chance to try this out. My honey and I ran through a learning game. I love it! The figures are great if a bit fragile and once you get the hang of all the pieces and rules, it seems fairly intuitive. Mechanically it is solid. Seems like a great blend of chaos and strategy! Can't wait to play again. Uneven power wasn't a problem this game, since neither of us know what we are doing. However, I hope that it enhances the game, once we learn, and doesn't break the gameplay.

Meh. I thought I would like it but found the iconology made it very hard to tell what was happening. I usually find Fantasy Flight Games to be better structured but this one feel like icons are just thrown on the board. Map boundaries are difficult to see and I had to keep second guessing or checking to make sure "adjacent" areas were in fact that. The game itself was interesting. Perhaps after a few more plays I might be able to see some better strategy but I don't see that happening.

The asymmetric chaos gods are great. Each is unique and compelling. The double victory conditions is also really cool. The duel win condition does lead to some cards for a few of the gods being completely dead since they focus on points for a god that almost always wins on their dial.

Love the Warhammer universe, so I'm prejudice to start with, but FFG have nailed it with this one.

However the game itself is full of subtleties, each power must be played with a view to its strengths, minimising its weaknesses while keeping the other powers at each others throats. Four ways to end the game with 2 ways to win (first past the post in Victory Points or the Sudden Death "Threat Wheel" win), so there is a lot to watch as well.

Had a pretty good time playing it, but it's not something I'd like to play often. The asymmetric victory goals for each race was too much to keep up with on first play. Too much ganging up on the leader (or perceived leader). But the game went faster than I expected, so that's a plus.

RATING: 5
Asymmetrical, card driven, action points, dice combat, area control, random event cards, miniatures. All things that make up the game, but they don't really describe what the game is all about. I started with asymmetrical because that is what the game really is. You have Khorne, the only player who really wants to use his warriors (a failing  of the game, but that's a point I'll get to) and will win or lose through combat alone (he's the madman everyone is running away from / trying to lock away in some remote corner / send elsewhere). You have Tzeentch, who wants to mess about, do wierd things to screw over his opposition with fun cards that teleport, mess up those numbers you so carefully counted up, and just simply be the "lord of change" that he is in the fluffy world of Warhammer, unlike Khorne Tzeetch can try to win two very different ways and is trying to avoid choosing until late in the game. Then you have Nurgle, having a filthy party with his cheap horde, what he wants the most is just to camp out in two regions, but he can't cause Khorne is out for blood - he can like Khorne only win one way effectively, by building up to a great turn where th board collapses into all the points he needs to win. Then you have Slaanesh, who like Tzeetch can win two ways and is also trying to wait to decide between the two, his cards are less wacky than Tzeetchs, but he's subtly and innocuously strengthening his position until he just emerges as the winner by default.

So say you are Tzeetch, and you really want to play your cool warrior creature and go tangle with that bastard Nurgle, well you can't... And if you do well, thanks, Khorne won game over...

The game is much more confined in the gamespace than what emerges from the rules, really, there are so many things that you just can't do because it means a) You'll lose but even worse b) You give the game away (usually to Khorne). This is the strongest negative I have of the game. It's fragile when players don't invest enough to play their part "correctly". However, with players who understand games and can with some insight judge which actions are "candidate moves" as opposed to "give the game to player X moves" (and really, it isn't that hard) - the game becomes a tense affair where everyone is screwing with everyone, trying to jab, push and pull their way to victory while also fulfilling their "job" in the game (that is, preventing everyone else from victory).

It's a game that allows you to be clever, with comboing cards and creatures, relying on your opposition to do your job for you so you can spend your resources getting ahead instead. So if everyone does their part right, the game shines. If you play with mixed company, with someone who does things "just because", or similar, it falls apart and becomes frustrating (like many multiplayer games with direct interaction between players), so don't play it with those!

A great game!

Well, had a very good time playing MikeB, Arno and James.  I was the red faction, the most fun to play because they score just by smacking people.  Nothing subtle here.  It was pretty overwhelming to everyone and I won fairly easily by becoming dominant.  With some practice, I think the faction can be defeated but you have to be always aware of them and hit them early and often.  But overall, the game itself is a bit overhyped.  Especially the theme: I did not feel it at all.  Like James said, it might work just as well as boutique shops scuffling at a mall.  And all this nonsense about the playing board being a map printed on human skin...where do they get that?  Looks like any old animal skin: people get worked up about very little.  Lots of silly plastic pieces as well.  But, as I said, had a bit of fun, rolled some dice.  The game is very easy for rules, although they did their best to make them hard to reference or find details.  The whole setting was ridiculous...who would name their race the Tzikinikines or whatever the hell it was?

hmm, that was interesting.  pretty good application of the warhammer universe.  fairly intuitive.  all four sides play very asymmetrical and was neat to watch each side working to achieve the win in their own way.

the "game can win" option, while a threat, did not seem like it would come into play in all but the rarest of circumstances.  might come into play if everyone fights amongst themselves a bit more, but i still think it would be fairly rare.

potential kingmaker issues in the end, but i need to think about that a bit further.  analysis paralysis players would have issues in the latter turns and could potentially cause it to drag.

Hmm, liked this one, but it probably requires more commitment than I'm willing to put in. The game is long enough, time-wise, and yet felt like it was over before I could get an engine going. I'd need more plays to develop strategy.

If all players know what they are doing, and you have exactly 4 players, and the old world deck doesn't throw up anything too one sided, you'll have a fun game. It's not really about coming up with your own strategy, more like playing your role well in an ecosystem. You may end up winning because the player best able to counter you didn't do their duty. I don't go into this obsessed with winning. I think it's fun enough to play the role well.

Several cards and upgrades are not useful. I've taken to playing variants suggested by the forum.

RATING: 7
The game has a major problem.

When it's played by new players or even with one new player it's total unbalanced and get's a 4.
When it's played by a veteran group the game really shines it's perfectly balanced and it get's an 8 or even 9.

I know it's balanced and it's a great achievement to do that given the assymetrical powers BUT
If everyone doesn't know what to do, how their cards work and how to stop each other the game is ruined.

Played once, with three people who had played multiple times before.  

Players play as one of four races fighting for control over eight-or-so regions in the world.  Players score points for controlling regions and being the first to destroy a region with corruption tokens.  Players can also win without victory points by advancing a "dial".  

I don't know what it was, but I just didn't get this game.  It's got some area-control aspects, some wargame aspects, and a whole bunch of cardgame "take that" card aspect to it.  The last bit is probably what annoyed me the most: each player has multiple decks that give them special powers in a region for one turn, making predicting what's going to happen in a region insane.

The game is also battle heavy, and units are fairly easy to kill (most require only 1 hit, which is a 50% chance with each attack).  This makes maintaining units in a region tough, yet maintaining a region seems key to victory (to get dominance points and to get corruption points).  Actually, maintining units in a region is only tough if other players pay attention to you: those players who were quietly in a small region could hold it for the whole game because nobody went in; those who were in the center got trashed.  And, of course, my color required me to go into the center to advance my wheel.

The game also took something like three hours or more, including rules, and I just don't think it's predictable enough for that time.  Sure, take-that is fun for an hour, but for three?

Long story short, I think I'm just not a fan of the highly-assymetrical power games that involve a high degree of random combat and have a bunch of "take that" special power cards that can be combo'd to oblivion.

I love this game so, so hard. So hard. So why won't anyone in my groups play the damn thing? The player powers are sharply distinguished and interactions between them are dynamic, the area control portion works really well on its own, and the overall effect is thematic, tense, and satisfying. Three player minimum hurts a bit; this would be a 9 with more regular play.

Great fun, with mechanics that nearly compel roleplaying while staying tight and thinky enough for Eurofans. The unique dial-advancement thing is brilliant.

The board is wonderfully atmospheric, and there's a lot of interesting stuff going on.  As a chaos god, though, I felt I spent to much of my time worrying about victory points instead of smashing stuff.  We'll see how that pans out in future games.

This game has some wonderful mechanics and is quite a joy once you get the hang of it.  Cards, battle, strategy, battle, power points, battle, area control, battle, dice and chaos.  Did I mention battle?   Good stuff here.

Don't judge the game after one or two plays.  There's quite a bit going on and it may seem overwhelming at first.  Especially with the wrong group.

Bought from my FLGS, Cool City Games. Set it up, read it, understand it, want to play it. It only handles 3-4 players, so I've got a 3 hour window each week where it could get played. *sigh*

Rated an 8 after 1 4-player game. Looks like it 'll take multiple plays to get the feel for how to play each race well.

Khorne has won all 3 of our games. It looks like this game needs to be played repeatedly by the same group to get a grasp on how to interact with each other to keep Khorne down. I've read that this is a typical beginning, that Khorne is a frequent winner until the table learns how to watch him and stop him. For example, I've never considered letting someone else get dial counters so they compete with Khorne and hold him back.

Played a couple of times after a layoff from this game and moved back up to 8. Also finally saw a non-Khorne win (Slaanesh.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Tight, intense, well-balanced, and an entirely different strategic game for each of the races. Reminds me of Dune, but boiled down to it's glowing core. This is a must-buy for me and I am really looking forward to playing it again.

--------

Update: since purchasing this and playing it a bit more, I can say I am deeply impressed by how... ah fuck it: here's the word for it: [u]elegant[/u] the whole game is. It just flows smoothly, there is never down-time, emotionally, the game feels extremely intense, it plays just as well with three as it does with four, and finally it plays so quickly, that in almost all cases, upon finishing, we all want to immediately play it again. It just doesn't get any better. Ratings bump to 9.

----------

Update:
Not only is this game hitting the table at almost every gaming session, but after finishing the first game of it, we all look at each other and nod and say, "again." And after several more plays, things are really starting to balance themselves out - we are starting to see far fewer dial click victories and there is a knife fight for VP. There is also some subtlety and strategic depth being revealed in the strange way some of the cards combo together or in how the players move around Khorne.

This is the first game in years that my excitement for has not fizzled with repeated plays.
---------------------------------------
Slight ratings downgrade. Still a classic, and it will always have plays at my table, but there is a limited group of people I can play it with.

Dark strategy board game set in the Warhammer universe.  (Did I say dark?  The board is a map that is apparently drawn on stretched skin!). You play one of four races, each with a very different feel.  Though some don't like the darkness of the game, it is fun to play when you are in the mood for something that you want to put some strategic thinking into.  Very much worth a try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
This one is in a similar camp to Cyclades, Kemet, and Blood Rage, however I feel it is a bit more complex than the others, largely due to the asymmetry of the gods.  I didn't enjoy my play of this as much as with the others, I suspect largely due to me playing Khorne (who doesn't have quite the diversity of options as the other gods) and from misplaying my first round, which limited my choices in future rounds more than I realized at first blush.  As par the norm on these types of games, you really need multiple plays to get a proper feel for the game.  I'd like to play again to see if more familiarity with the game will help my enjoyment.

Although mechanically different, this felt a lot like the disappointing Middle-Earth Quest: a possibly decent strategy game buried under myriad mechanisms that ultimately detract from the experience. Nothing is elegant. The cards are disappointingly redundant and don't really add to the deplorable theme. There seems to be "multiple paths" to victory, but really each role has a fairly scripted approach to the game. Some people appreciate this "replayability" (four games in one!), but I'm one of those boring Eurogamers who'd rather just play El Grande.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Alright, I've finally played this one and I can see why people like it.  That being said, it's not really my type of game.  Not a huge area-control fan, and I prefer the Euro with little wooden cubes to the plastic minis and the many cards with text.  I don't care much for the dark 40K theme either and it wouldn't fit in too well with my gaming friends.  Still, it's a good game, more interesting than El Grande.  I like the variable powers and paths to victory.

Cool Theme of the evil gods in Warhammer world, a good symbiosis of eurogame and ameritrash , i will recommend it, good re playability, with a lot of fun , because of the differences between all the gods, and if really want to have some fun just play it 8 time ,2 time with each fraction after this if you don't like the game just sell it, i will always recommend it just because all people want sometimes to be a little evil :)

RATING: 7
A unique, assymetrical game which carries the concept of area control into a completely new level. It is incredibly thematic and requires a lot of thinking and effort to second-guess your opponents' malevolent plans. Each chaos power has a considerably different play style and strategic options abound at every step. On top of that, the number of regions isn't that large, thus with space so tight and four angry gods unleashing their fury with each and every action, the gameplay is always tense and full of surprises. However, if you play the game with people who don't necessarily understand its nuances, then you might just as well get a completely different experience. They'll say that the game is out of balance, and that  Khorne has it all too easy. Right... Just don't listen to that bullshit and get a proper group to play the game - it'll knock your socks off!

EDIT: I've been playing with the Horned Rat expansion for quite a while now and I must say that I'm rather disappointed with the changes it has introduced. I liked the original game better, even though there were some tiny balance issues (which assymetrical game hasn't got those?). What I mean is that although I still like the game in general, then the more I play with the expansion, the less I enjoy the whole experience. Time to move on to something else...

I love this typically over produced FFG game. Oozes theme from every pore. The graphic design is so full-on to be almost too much, but I don't mind that. The plastic miniatures are a tad flimsy but still very nice. This game seems to get better with experience as each Chaos power plays differently and a knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each one is needed to do well.

One of the best, balanced in its unbalancement (!) fantasy area control with powers out there. The theme scores a +1 for me, because it's really "alive", from the map to the (somewhat fragile) minis and moreover the "feeling" that the game exudes; but I see that someone may find it too gross. That's ok, as long as you know what you're buying.

It is a little gem, and among the best FFG designs out there. A keeper.

This is a very good conquest game and one of the only ones I have enjoyed enough to want to play again!

The individual play styles and goals of the different powers sets CitOW apart from the usual Risk-style crap.

The problems keeping it from a 9 and even 10 is that the game group chiefly decides the strength of the gameplay and how enjoyable the experience is.

The fact it must be played with 4 players and 4 players only means it doesn't hit the table as often as it deserves. The balance and effects of the 4 Powers coupled with their play styles keep the game balanced. With one God omitted or poorly played by the owning player one or more of the others will dominate the game and have a much easier time.

Also playing with 4 (or 5 with expansion) usually makes CitOW a long affair- usually 2 hours or more each game. We've had games go to 3 and a half hours with 5 players!

Oh and besides the ability to play with 5 players instead of 4 the expansion sucks.

UPDATE: A solid design and thus an 8.

Is this an in-house FFG design?  Innovative mechanics, great theme, interesting decisions, great player interaction, all without two million draw decks and chit piles?  Why yes it is!  Only one 3-player game under my belt, but we all wanted a 4-player game right on the heels of this one.  This will make we actually take a second look at Mr. Lang's other designs.

But the garish art on the board and the chameleonic counters is a blow to the whole presentation. I'm amazed in this day and age that FFG can still screw up the color palette like they have.

RATING: 8
A really well balanced game that is something of a Euro/Ameritrash hybrid in the way it plays.

Each race worships a different god in the Old World and they all have different means for achieving victory as they look to corrupt the Old World in order to give power to their great one. 

The production values of this one are excellent and the inclusion of race based card decks and victory wheels in addition to a VP track make each race feel very different. 

In fact a player will not do well by playing to a generic strategy here. They must really get to grips with what their race does well and play to those strengths. 

What makes the game tricky at first is knowing how to play your race well but also knowing what other players are trying to do and making sure that you make it hard for them to acheive those goals.

For this reason I think CitOW really begins to shine when a group of 4-5 players reach their 5th plus game as it will all begin to click and flow well then. 

Oh the max player count of 4 for the base game is probably most desireable.

RATING: 8
Easy to play, but hard to master type of game. At first glance, the Khorne player should be the easiest to play because its mechanic is straight forward, and statistically the dices that you roll will always get you some sort of reward... wrong! Once all players are familiar with the game, Khorne player will be the hardest to play due to various reasons, including highest energy cost versus other factions which also means slowest in speed.
Very short and strategic game, can be played in less than 90 minutes.

You are one of the 4 Chaos Gods of Warhammer, not something you can do everyday or in other games. The game mechainc is simple but every move, every spell and every action counts to win. I gave a 9 because the spells and the power card in the original game, forced the player to play always the same tactic. With the expansion the Horned Rat, this issue is solved and the game is simply fantastic. Thanks to the large number of events cards, every game is completely different from the other. Thank you Eric Lang, thank you very much for this amazing game

RATING: 9
The most thematic eurogame there is and easily one of the best boardgames out there. Eric Lang has proven, that area and majority control and victory points can actually tie into the theme. The character powers are highly diverse (and asymetrical to some degree), but balanced almost to perfection. It feels like a heavier version of El Grande at times, but in the most positive way thinkable. A timing mechanism also assures that the game is not lasting too long, which is always a big plus.

RATING: 7
This is a 7 without the expansion, but an 8 with it. Either way, this is a fantastic area control game. It really does feel like the predecessor to Blood Rage, but while Blood Rage is a quick skirmish for points, this game feels more like a campaign. Blood Rage may be the better design, but I do like a few things about this game a great deal in comparison. I find the card play to be very interesting, the different factions fun to explore, and the event deck is something I like in almost any game it's featured in. At the same time, it's much longer in comparison, and you can't really tailor your team the way you want it to be. It also feels just a tad underdeveloped with how rigid the various strategies are. Still, this is a fantastic game, and is second only to Dominant Species when it comes to epic, multiplayer area control games.

UPDATE: As much as I enjoy Chaos in the Old World, Blood Rage is going to have more staying power due to its varying strategies from game to game. The various factions here are all interesting to explore, but don't offer much in the way of variation...even with the alternate expansion decks.

Probably one of the finest FFG in-house designs. Unfortunately Khorne's pace is dictated by other gods being willing (or not) to flee him, the initial setup can screw some players (especially Tzeench) and predicting scores by adding several double digit numbers never feels great. Still quite a good game that I would recommend if you *love* the Warhammer licence (and are okay not seeing its usual factions) or have a budget policy against Cthulhu Wars, which has replaced CitOW for me.

The game has amazing artwork and it's a tight strategic experience with wonderful asymmetric play... it's oozing theme. My only gripe is the amount of tiny text and chits to keep track of on some overly small areas of the map. The design of the map is too crowded. It can be hard to keep everything in mind. 

EDIT (raise from 7.8 to 9.8): The faults are easier to handle with repeated play, and the game also gets more and more fun with emerging strategic and tactical depth. Love it. The closeness of matches with incredibly different strategies and characters is Mind-Blowing.

Very enjoyable area control game in the spirit of the Warhammer fantasy universe.  The Chaos Gods play uniquely in line with their powers and the game looks good on the table, even if the artwork is not to everyone's taste.

Have played three times now spread over two GenCons.  The game is very compact in its rules, which is something that I like.  Each of the 4 "forces" has it's own unique style to win, and it's fairly obvious what that style is.  One force advances by brute fighting.  Another advances by placing corruption in specific areas.  Etc.  Since everything is so up-front, though, everyone has a good sense of everyone else's main objectives.  This produces an atmosphere of attrition, but avoids screwage.  Despite the former, games clock in at 1 to 1.5 hours.  Combine with a very quick set up, and you've got an enjoyable game.

RATING: 6.5
In this 3-4 player game, each player is an evil race, with their own special abilities. Players play cards or monsters onto the board to earn points or leave corruption on the board. Battles are resolved by rolling dice. A player can win two ways: by scoring 50 pts, or moving their special dial marker around a number of steps.

It's a decent game, where you decide whether you put on weak monsters or strong monsters, and balance it out with cards. You also have a choice to score VPs, or try to get your dial around to win. Looking forward to more plays. It does take a couple plays to understand the rules, nuances and strategy. Playing with an inexperienced player who just feeds Khorne, for example, doesn't bode well for the other players, so there is a bit of a learning curve. Unfortunately all my games have been with inexperienced players, and there have been runaway leaders. There are some neat ideas here, but it does rely on other players to police each other, and it's not really my type of game. I do like the costs of playing cards and characters onto the board, but the rest of it just isn't my cup of tea.

I researched the hell out of this game and ordered a copy which should be here Sept 2013. I'm incredibly excited to play it. I'm anticipating the possibility of this becoming my favorite conquest game, possibly played and enjoyed more often than War of the Ring or Age of Conan but we'll have to see.

UPDATE: 

This may become my new go to conquest game, replacing out other domination games even though its technically area control (still domination in my opinion). A more thematic domination game that's better balanced and more strategic satisfying and interesting could not be asked for.

Seriously, this game is more fun for me and more satisfying to play than Risk of any variant, Samurai Swords, even Age of Conan which I love. It even has a few things over the legendary War of the Ring which I will always play.

Chaos in the Old World is quite simply How. a. board. game. should. be. in terms of quality. I think this is the first game I'll give a 10 too with the ONLY downside that is meaningful to me being:

1. Sometimes particular areas run low on spaces (I like the chaos of this though as it FEELS corrupty this way

2. It's perfectly balanced at 4. With expansion plays well with 5. and still plays good at 3. With 2 it's terribly unbalanced but I'd imagine still fun.

RATING: 8.5
Although it looks like a dice-rolling wargame, battle is not the main thrust of the game. Playing cards effectively, selecting the right upgrades, and moving your units in response to a changing battlefield make for a lot of interesting strategy decisions. Lots of replay value since starting gods and board configuration is always different, and there is a large deck of event cards that affects play randomly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A good heavy theme game.  You can still enjoy this game even if you are completely unfamiliar with the Warhammer world, however it will help to know it some.

I really enjoy the unbalanced powers.  They attempt to add up to the same amount of power, but just in different ways, and I like games that can do this.  Board map is a little confusing, but very artfully (new word) done.  There may be some weight issues, as far as one of the 4 factions being more powerful than the others, as well as a couple of misprints in the rules.

Overall, good game.

The more I play it the stronger I feel that the euro-gamey mechanical side of things is just a bit more overpowering in this one than I normally enjoy. I realize it is a hybrid but the gameplay feels very constrained to me especially for Slaanesh and Nurgle. Also, the Old World cards make hardly any impact on gameplay. No wonder the expansion comes with an entirely different deck. In fact, all the cards in The Horned Rat are so much better than the original ones.

Which character you're playing determines your strategy -- all four characters play completely differently, but somehow the game is balanced.

Major checkbox: VARIABLE PLAYER POWERS.

Still one of my favorite games; I don't get to play it nearly enough.

The adversarial nature of the balance in this game is very political, which is normally a downside for me. However, the balance is actually really tight in this game. I don't know many other games where you can actively cause your opponents to fight each other instead of you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
PRO: Super tight, strategic game. It always seems to come right down to the wire. Excellent theme - the chaos gods of the Old World. What could be more evil or disgusting?

CON: The idea behind the design of the board was great, but the implementation of it fell short. The board is excessively large and the territory boundaries are nearly invisible.

I love that each god has a different victory condition, therefore making each god play completely different.  They even designed it in a way that makes each god oppose each other at different times in the game, kind of an internal checks and balances.  I imagine that each time you play as a different god the game feels a bit different, which is awesome.

This is an area majority game mixed with combat and strategic card play.  Can't wait to play more!

Definitely has issues. The fact that all players need to know the game well in order to have it balanced is a flaw regardless of what people may say. It's a fine circle of factions keeping on other in check.  This creates a rather unique and exciting game that can veryou rewarding but also can end up being very frustrating as well.
Some factions are easier to play than others too. It is far from balanced overall but a brilliant experience and very enjoyable game.

I specially enjoy the asimetry this game offers, but also presents some doubts about its balance, especially with less than 4 players (Khorne suffers, because the game is not that populated).

I need to play more to have a strong opinion on it.

I played once. All parties to the conflict are varied, but appear to be balanced. Raises some doubt confusing scoring "on the wheel," but after a while probably will not be a problem.

RATING: 7.5
Gioco asimmetrico ambientato nel mondo fantasy molto valido e originale. L'originalità (ripresa a tratti da Lord of the Ice Garden) sta nelle differenti condizioni di vittoria e nell'asimmetria propria di ogni razza che spingono ad adottare strategia diametralmente opposte ad ogni giocatore. Il gioco offre una forte interazione che a volte risulta quasi fastidiosa. Ottimi i materiali e anche graficamente il gioco rimane suggestivo anche se il tabellone nelle prime partite potrebbe non essere immediato. Regolamento molto ricco e gioco tosto che si padroneggia dopo qualche partita.

Asymmetrical powers and a unique take on a familiar theme. Events can be swingy but experienced players are able to recognize this and balance it out. I really like this one and it needs to hit the table more. Stick with 4 players (5 players if using the expansion).

Lots of interaction, lots of choices, varied play-style for each of the four gods, good looking, well thought out, marvelous game.

That said, this is still probably the single best 4-player game i have ever played. GET IT!

"El Grande" with assymetrical conditions mates with Warhammer. 

The mechanisms aren't really revolutionary, but still, this is an exciting and demanding tactical game. Furthermore, the theme is striking like no other, very present and implemented in a marvellous way. The flavour text printed on the cards should always be read aloud for the sake of the atmosphere. The artwork is just awesome, although lacking functionality. 
What I like about the game play is that it has strong elements of "chaotic" player interaction with surprising outcomes. On the other hand, it is possible to plan ahead and make good decisions. The replay value seems to be high enough the moment I'm writing these lines.

It's one of the few FF games with roughly accurate game length denomination.

What a game! You are the ultimate evil bad guy! No...you cannot choose to play a good guy in this game! You are bad...the worst of the worst...and you have your own agenda for winning the game! And yet...this game is so simple to play!

The rules are concise and to the point, the rounds of play are all on your character sheet! You can spread your corruption through the lands, you could just have a little battle here or there, you could mess with your opponents plans by placing your chaos cards around the board! So simple and yet a very tight game where any character could win!

*放圖板每個腳色轉盤轉到開始處，毀壞卡照左上數字疊起1最上面，舊世界卡洗勻3/4人時使用8/7張，拿2貴族3傳送石4農民隨機放在九個地點
*隨機發腳色並照轉盤腳色順時鐘坐好(起始玩家為上方腳色)，每個玩家拿對應腳色的所有配件，分數標記放0，魔力標記放個人版標示處，每人洗勻自己的混亂卡並抽3張
*遊戲進行數輪，每輪有6個階段，達到結束條件就結束，有順序的部分依照圖板轉盤順序由上順時鐘結算
1.舊世界階段 開一張舊世界卡並執行效果，如果有選擇性由威脅值最低的選，如果有永久效果把之前放在效果去的左推放上去，只會有兩張有效果，被推出去的棄掉，有隕石邊的可能會因為一些效果被棄掉
2.抽牌階段 每人根據腳色圖板指示抽牌(有升級卡可多抽的)，抽完將棄牌洗勻繼續抽，無手牌上限，然後魔力回到標記處(有升級卡提升魔力)，之前沒用完的不會留
3.招喚階段 照順序輪流執行一個動作，直到pass時魔力移動到0，所有魔力到0的都直接跳過，全部人結束就結束
>招喚一個生物到場上，支付對應魔力，要跟之前放的在同一區或相鄰，移動視為重新招換要耗魔力(且一樣只能相鄰)
>出牌到地區執行效果並支付魔力，一個地區只能有兩張，左邊先結算
4.戰鬥階段 照圖板順序一個區域一個區域結算，所有場上的生物根據其戰鬥力擲對應數量骰，4以上算命中，6可再多丟一顆，照順位丟完後就決定要打誰在換下一位骰，不同玩家造成的傷害不累積，不能打友軍(被控制的算敵軍)，掛點的放倒但一樣會擲骰攻擊，農民一點就可以打掉拿走(提前戰鬥卡會先移除掛點的，且傷害可累積)
5.腐化階段 分成兩個主要階段
>計算征服值 每個區域照順序結算，每隻怪1點加上該區的卡牌魔力總合為該玩家征服值，該區最高的(平手就跳過)比較該區的抵抗值，如果超過則獲得該區分數(抵抗跟分數在該區下方數字，雖然區域初始一樣，可能被卡牌影響導致不同)
>腐敗 每個區域照順序每個信徒(1級兵)放一個腐敗標記，如果該區總和超過12(傳送石也算)則該去毀滅，抽最上面的毀滅卡放這，此回合有放腐敗標記的拿上面分數，毀滅卡不夠則區域不再毀滅
6.結束階段又分成6個階段結算
>移除場上所有混亂卡到各自棄牌堆
>結算有英雄標記的區域，該區有腳色且威脅值最高的玩家選擇一隻腳色回自己供應區
>左到右結算舊世界卡的回合效果
>毀滅卡記分，每個有該卡且開著的區域計算腐敗值，根據順位拿分數改卡蓋著，平手跟下個名次分數加起來平分(無條件捨去)
>每個轉盤上有威脅標記的轉一格，最多威脅標記得再轉一格(平手都不轉)，所有標記回供應區
*遊戲結束條件有四個，最後一個全輸，其他如果回合結束條件有達到就結束，第1個條件優先權最高，平手則比分數，其他都比分數，如果比分數時平手則比威脅值(轉盤值)
1.有人轉盤到達勝利格
2.有人分數到達50分
3.五個區域毀滅
4.舊世界卡抽完
**威脅輪盤 每個玩家獲得威脅標記的條件不同，獲得就放轉盤上，旋轉時升級就馬上獲得升級的好處，升兩級就拿兩次
**舊世界標記 事件標記舊根據卡片放置，都不移除，英雄標記結束階段結算，貴族標記增加地區的分數值，市民標記無效果可被收集，鼠人標記降低抵抗值，傳送石算腐敗值
*地區結算順序照地圖箭頭，且因為不是同時發生所以會互相影響
*被毀滅的地區 不能打卡，不能放標記，不會算征服分數，不會放腐敗標記
*如果卡牌效果打架，則取消效果優先

RATING: 10
An awesomely tight game for experienced players. It demands strategy, tactics, and diplomacy to win. The variable player powers drastically change the feeling of playing every time. 

After enough plays, Khorne seemed a bit over powered. We now play with decks of Chaos Cards custom made with the Horned Rat expansion to even things out a bit.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
1 play - so I'm not an expert.

This game would have been better without dice (like Starcraft, Game of Thrones, Antike/Imperial, Tempus etc.). I don't see why they were included or how they improve the game. 

A potential problem might be that the winner is the player who gets picked on the least (or gets lucky), rather than the person who played best.  

I have heard/read comments about balance issues that require players to gang up on such-and-such a demon. 

It gets high ratings though so maybe I'm missing something.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A streamlined, chaotic (HA!) game with lots of interaction and vastly different playstyles for each god.  It's easy to teach and always enjoyable.  Time will tell if Khorne really is too powerful, but the process in figuring out how to defeat the other gods while fulfilling your own objectives is satisfying. Looking forward to more plays, and the new Skaven expansion.

Game appears excellent on first play.  The small differences in the characters and the threat dials to go along with each players different mini goal on a turn by turn basis really bring this together.  I missed a few rules the first time I taught this to a group.  I would like to play this again very soon, especially with people who are not new to the game.

Edit: Got this to the table quickly again as I wanted.  Played purple dude instead of nurgle this time, and I love the different feels of the players.  The game was much more strategic than the first time.  This game has ten potential, and could easily end up my favorite area control game.

RATING: 7
Perhaps surprisingly, the game this most reminds me of is A Game Of Thrones. You have build points. Use them to deploy units to areas on the board. Get VP's for an area if you've accumulated enough strength, and branch out from there. You have a unique condition to meet in as many areas as you can that progress you on your special power track, and if you progress enough along here you can win before the most VPs condition is met. Therefore, like aGoT, everyone has to carefully watch the other players and intervene if they're progressing too rapidly. There's some hit cards to play on other players which help, but the amount of whacking you can do each turn is limited as you only have so many build points. A random event each turn mixes things up (again, similar to aGoT).  The overall feel, once you're past all the theme and chrome, is simply a question of deployment each turn. You have 6 action points to progress both your special power action track AND accumulate VPs simultaneously, and it's a bonus if you can hinder opponents at the same time. The game will shine when all players are alert, but paradoxically the result will then be even more likely to then be a fallout of player interaction chaos. I enjoyed the ride the game gave and wouldn't say no to more, but I have a suspicion your success is more likely to be a result of other player's actions rather than your own.

Very close to exactly what I want in a game... DOAM, good strategy, multi-player, asymmetrical sides, dice-chucking, direct conflict, lots of paths to victory and lots of 'take that!' all in about 2 hours.

If I had to complain about anything it's that I wish there was a little more combat.  Sure you can force it but, most of the time, it's better for Nurgle, Tzeentch and Slaanesh to avoid combat completely.

**Increased rating from 7 to 9. A few plays really brings out the strategy and fun in this game.

Absolutely fantastic. Fun game, high replayability, easily explained to new players who can then compete with the veterans. (If you tell them: Khorne will fight you, if you let him, he'll win. Nurgle will win if left alone. Slanesh can prevent combats. Tzeentch can teleport you with devastating results.) All the different powers play differently, the cards are fun. Really nice balance of thematic fun (I love that the 'good guys' influence the board too) and nice mid-weight strategy.

RATING: 9.5
Absolutely love this game! Must be one of the very finest in my collection. I love the different strategies for each of the characters. It's very cool that there are several ways to achieve victory in this game and there is even the chance for all players to collectively lose the game!

I dare say it has close to infinite replay value. If you like you can specialize in one character, which will take you some time, and after you managed that you can try with another character that will play completely different! There are four different guys! And once you manage to play well with all of them, so do the other players you play this game with, so it will get more and more challenging with time! It's absolutly awsome!

All the buzz and hype around this game is totally justified!

- Rules are ok, only problem is that they're quite lengthy, means you need to study a bit before you actually play. Once mastered though, it's not difficult to explain, but requires a "test drive" for newcomers to absorb all the details!

Played CitOW a number of times and after a couple of years of not playing it, we played a 4 player game of it. I was Khorne and it was quite dull, managed to get a dial tick victory in the minimum amount of roudnds (I was getting two ticks per round)

I don't really want to play it again.

RATING: 6
Rather than enjoying each gods' differences, we actually found it too restrictive and limiting -you must play this way...
Especially with the only player who'd played before having the easiest race (just keep killing at least once a round). Other differences like not knowing each dial mapped the same or even had the same number of steps didn't enamour us either.

RATING: 8
Fun war/area control game that I'm not convinced is balanced... Maybe its just cause I have yet to analyse the strategies but dial victories seem much easier than anything else, so nurgle is at my low end but as the forums have said this probably isnt true. I am also not fond of the upgrade cards and some are much better than others and the event deck does not seem interesting enough to me. Another issue is playing 3 player Chaos is not that fun. Maybe an expansion is needed to even some of these things out (small box for more interesting cards?)

With the an expansion coming out I had to break out chaos again and I fell in love again! Playing a true 4 player game also help but now with the skaven coming to dominate my table I cant wait!!

[SOLD, June 2017]

Needs to hit the table more often.  Vastly different races and victory conditions make each race a unique experience to play and creates interesting conflict situations.  Another positive is the relatively short playing time; the various victory conditions along with the fact that it is possible for all players to lose force the action and prevent turtling a la Risk.

Geez I really want to like this more than I do. I like area control, I love minis and its in the Warhammer universe. 

But....

-I think it sucks with 5. There are too many game altering cards and events to manage in anything resembling a fun way for me.

-Horned rat expansion = no beuno...esp for the noob to play.  

-Both games now I have seen Khorne win.

I think this might be a spectacular game if you really got into it with the same group of players and played the crap out of it for like...a solid month. Really climb in there and get familiar with all its eccentricities and unique-ness. 

Is that likely to happen in my gaming circles? I doubt it.

4 Plays - brilliant game. My complaint however with almost all eric lang games is to do with movement and how troops move accross the map/ play area. In this, you don't get a sense of moving your troops accross a battle field, or having to deal with distance/ time spent marching/ commitment required to make long journeys. In this game, you simply choose a region and dump models there (of coure there's a lot more to it than that, but in a nutshell...). Some ppl I'm sure will love this style, but I do not. Give me a real battle field where real battle lines are drawn. Other than that, great game.

While this sounds like a negative review, this game is absolutely Langs best game, expertly balanced with very asymmetric races. Perfect tension from beginning to end.

A very balanced battle game where you control one of four gods, each with different objectives. You can win win points but destroying locations but you can also win by achieving objectives and thus advancing your dial. Everyone knows your objective so you must fight for placement and achieve your objective more often then the others each turn in order to advance faster.

Non è proprio il mio tipo di gioco. Chaos in The Old World porta lo stampino della Fantasy Flight Games: manuale monumentale (32 pagine più eventuali errata... non è più un divertimento, è un lavoro), regole e regolette "di ambientazione" ("il giocatore ottiene una pedina squish per almeno ogni pedina squosh che piazza in fase di tracciamento in territori con almeno una pedina spruzz"), meccaniche pro-sega mentale e soprattutto, tema fantasy e grafica per bimbiminkia (cupo, artwork stucchevole e barocco, tutti cattivi, ecc.). La parte del tabellone con la mappa è un po' piatta (e i confini li ha disegnato uno più daltonico di me), e le rotelle sono belle a vedersi ma francamente gratuite. Mille carte e mille segnalini-sega riempiono mezzo tavolo con la scusa di "aggiungere varietà" al gioco.
Nonostante la mia bassa soglia di sopportazione per questo tipo di giochi, non mi sento di dargli un voto bassissimo perché, a differenza dei suoi predecessori FFG, almeno questo ha la decenza di avere una durata contenuta (alla fine, il 20% del tempo di gioco è fare il setup e rimettere a posto), e poi scorre più velocemente di quanto temessi (anche se mischiare meccaniche da eurogame e fuffa ameritrash è come bere un Sassicaia in un bicchiere di merda). Come al solito, i componenti sono di una qualità eccezionale.
Per quanto riguarda le fazioni, ho la sensazione che Khorne e Slaanesh siano molto più avvantaggiati nella progressione (gli basta un morto/una corruzione per avere un punto dominio, al contrario degli altri due che per farlo devono soddisfare due condizioni).
L'autore è uno dei responsabili del Briscolone Spaziale (Battlestar Galactica): benché si avverta la sensazione del "prendiamo un'idea e complichiamola all'infinito", a questo giro gli è venuta ugualmente male, ma un po' meno.

At its heart, this is an area control game with dice-based combat.  It's a good concept, and the board and bits look amazing.  However, the game heavily features unique player powers, and from my one play, these were not at all balanced.  Further play will be necessary for me to evaluate whether this imbalance is often an issue.  Also, while the dials are pretty, they obscured information that really should be known.

Initially the game can be overwhelming. You have 4 separate gods that all act differently and need to keep others in check. Meanwhile you're busy trying to throw your cultists into the mix to ruin regions. You want the most but then you become a target if you're leading in points.

I love how all this blends together into a nice meaty euro-y ameritrashy experience. Yes, the dice can completely fuck you over which is frustrating but with general planning and backup planning, I think that luck mostly mitigates itself. I have had games where I can't roll a hit to save my life and I've had games where my opponents roll nothing but 6's. Both are annoying but generally not completely unwinnable.

My biggest complaint about the game is the event deck which can be either completely random and useless or rather mean and vicious. I have issues with the map being functionally annoying as well based on the dark and gritty nature of the game. It can often be hard to see what's adjacent and what's actually a region.

Overall, I really enjoy the game, but it requires exactly 4 players (now 5 with the expansion) which has a TON of competition in the board gaming world.

Initial impression based on four plays: it's pretty dang cool. There's a lot to keep track of, but it results in an involving and interesting game. Some major choices seem a lot less viable than others (certain upgrades, going for VP/dial victory with some of the Powers), which is somewhat disappointing only because the game is otherwise really great. Hoping the expansion fixes that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A strongly thematic game with a lot of euro-style elements included. The best part of the game is the asymmetry of gods and the theme.

Miniature quality is rather average (the banner of cultists is a joke) and drops the rating a bit. Everything in this game is designed to be easy-to-use. Too bad the game only works with four. We tried with three but something was missing...

Still, a good game with a lot of different playing styles to be found, thanks to the asymmetry. Enjoyable!

Fun Factor: 10 (The level of interaction here is just right.  A social game that also manages to be a thinker.  The perfect mix.)
Components: 10 (The good stuff.  Great models.  Good graphic design.  The board may be the weakest point, but I argue- it is precisely what is needed and no more.)
Theme: 10 (Amazing.  Playing the badguys just makes this game crackle with that much more electricity, because even the most stalwart goody-goody feels the call to backstab, outmaneuver and outwit his friends with impunity.)
Mechanics: 10 (Many different design ideas come together perfectly.)
Theme + Mechanics: 10 (Together the game is perfectly honed.  My favorite bit is how each player has two methods of victory and is working at them simultaneously. The cards give a perfect feel to each power involved.)
Replay Value: 9 (Every game has been different, and yet, there is a minute amount of similarity.  Very minute.)
Scaling/Players: N/A (This game needs four.  No less, no more.  Three can be attempted, but I feel the perfect balance is defeated.)

Subjective: +0.25 There are few games indeed that combine many disparate design elements, and in so doing, the whole of the pieces become transcendental.  This game has cards, alternate win conditions, area control, interaction and negotiation, variable player powers and secondary win conditions, an inbuilt timer... just to mention a few.  There is true genius here.

7/15/12 - This is one of my new favorite games and it gets better and better each time I play it. The asymmetrical player factions are amazing and balanced which is an extremely hard goal to accomplish for a game. The board however is designed poorly and can get cluttered easily. It would have been nice to have more distinct borders and places to put the tokens/figures so things wouldn't get so complicated looking. Other than that the game is pretty awesome and I can't wait to get the Horned Rat expansion. I do wish this game was 6 player though. I would give it a 10 if it was.

3/11/13 - Played this again with 4 people and it was really fun. The game board is horrific though. It's just a huge cluster of chits and busy drawings. I wish they made the board look better.

It's not a terrible game, but I have serious doubts that it would play well with two.  The theme is pretty goofy "creep-out" fantasy, not my style.  The thing that really bugged me was the poor design of all the cultist figures.  Every color had those wheel-shaped staff-toppers falling off.  The other thing that really bugged me was the lack of variability amongst the troop types, the differences felt so minuscule, it was really disappointing.  The progress wheels were a cool idea, but again they seemed badly placed, they kept getting bumped askew.

I don't think the gameplay warrants such a high rating, but the total package is just so fun. It manages to successfully combine area control, which I love, with the fun of role playing, dice rolling, miniatures, and back and forth card play. All the good bits of Ameritrash gaming on top of a game with deep strategy. Each god is so defined that games will always play out in a similar way, but the random elements make it impossible to play on autopilot.

Chaos deities.  An endless struggle.  Earth is a helpless wasteland, a stage for the monumental conflict between beings far more vast than humanity can understand.

So satisfying in its unwavering commitment to being completely over the f*cking top.  Everything is hideous and disgusting and beautiful.  

A lot of people are put off initially because of the seemingly huge battle advantage of Khorne.  This is before they realize this is not a battle game (if anything it is a card game!  With area control)  Once everyone knows how to play, it is the most gloriously balanced game I have ever witnessed.  The more everyone struggles, the more the balance is reinforced.  The harder they pull, the tighter the knot that binds everyone.  

The asymmetry is amazing.  Every player has their own set of cards which let them manipulate the game in any way imaginable, but each with their own personality.  The timing can be crushing, with feint after blow after undermining blow.  And in the end, when the dust settles and the ruination takes hold, someone manages to squeak ahead.  How?  Through sheer will and determination.  This game is a vehicle of ingenuity.  Enjoy the ride.

My personal favourite at the moment. The undisputed champion. Demons fighting over supremacy of the Old Warhammer world. Killing, corrupting, magic, seduction, ever changing strategies, twists and turns make this a jewel of a game. The components are great, except for the cultists whose banners break easily. FFG sends replacements but they are just as fragile. You can score points by having control over territories, or invest in the future by corrupting them slowly for more points - just be sure your opponents don't get in front. If this does not suite you, just concentrate on fulfilling your unique godly interests and you will be rewarded with points, power upgrades and the chance to alter the map layout. Whoever gets to 50 points or completes his personal agenda first wins. But be sure to win before the world you fight over is destroyed or before the inhabitants of the world manage to find a way to send you back into the netherworld! Quite apocalyptic, if you ask me.

I have been playing games for a long time (since shortly after Moses descended the mountain). In all of that time, I have encountered only one other game that surprised me as Chaos in the Old World has. That game was Dune. In both of these games the mechanics are simple (place a few pieces, play a few cards) but the subtle and intricate complexities of the various encounters of these pieces and cards nearly baffles the mind. One or two plays of this game simply touches the surface. 

As with Dune, the time from the moment the game begins until it concludes is tense and fraught with critical decisions. The variety of paths each of the Chaos Lords may take to victory forces each player to not only attempt scoring for themselves but prevent opponents from scoring. Layered on this is the possibility that preventing one opponent from scoring may be just what is required for a different opponent to score.

After just a few plays I would have to say that this is the best game Lang has designed and possibly the best game Fantasy Flight publishes. The game play, the art, the components...it is sheer excellence.

*****
After many, many plays, this game never ceases to amaze me. Something unexpected has occurred each time we play and the tension each turn continues. As with Dune, this game can be blunt or very subtle.

Thematic game where as a demon, you try to ruin the world in the way you want it ruined as opposed to the way your opponents want to ruin it. This is done through playing cards in one of two zone slots and by having your minis fight other minis. Each turn the player who did their thing the best gets two "twists" of their dial which facilitate upgrades or in some cases total victory. This can get a little exhausting.

RATING: 5
Over-rated game in my opinion. The board is not well designed and should have been made clearer to the players. The cards are too small, and there are not enough of them in terms of variety and they are plain and boring to look at. 

The 'exploding hits on a 6 rule' is a bad one and puts too much luck into the game. Also, you have to play with exactly four players otherwise the game loses all its appeal. Finally, Khorne seems way too strong in the game and needs to be toned down to make the game interesting.

I like the mechanics very much - also if the in-game feel is very cold for my tastes; simple rules but hard choices during play. I dislike the theme wich is too 'evil' for my tastes; as someone wrote here somewhere, it glorifies evil and suffering and this alone it's not a good thing in my opinion.
Components are good, but the miniatures are poor.

CITOW is definitely a FFG game. You can tell by the mechanics, the bits and the theme. But also because it is a mixture of other FFG games, effectively it borrows a lot from Middle Earth Quest, BSG and War of the Ring. Anyhow, it is a good game and all the Ameritrash laurels are in there, various player powers, flavouring, global effects, specific effects, dice and so forth. I never played Warhammer before but I feel it emulates the gritty world quite well. The strategies are varied and I enjoyed how the outcome could not be predicted by the veteran player. Still, I would have been more impressed by this if it was not for many similar games by FFG I have player before.

The base game has issues, but shows promise.
Couple this together with The Horned Rat however, and this rivals Game of Thrones.

My first few times playing I often felt like the map was claustrophobic, and there weren't enough actions to implement a meaningful plan.  But each time I would come away ruminating along the lines of "Well, if I had done X then maybe..."  or "Oh now I get it, this is meant to be used like so..."  

The strategy runs deep and despite not having the grandest time, this game always leaves me wanting to try it again with new tactics.

My thoughts on the game are as chaotic as those awful chaos cards...by midway through my first game I was thinking this would be another AT once-off. Too many "take that!" powerful chaos cards, frustrating inability to plan ahead and lots of whining of the "why did you play that on me, I'm coming last" variety. 

But things improved dramatically (and the game finished in a similar manner) towards the end. You can plan against some of the cards, combat works nicely, the asymmetric powers mean a lot of repeat plays. Very cool AT design (just because it scores with area control doesn't mean it is a euro - this is 100% AT). 

Don't really like the theme. The chaos mythology always gave me the creeps. The gods remind me of images people come up with after a really bad drug trip. But still, it works, it's quick, there's a lot to think about. Could be an AT game of choice.

Really, really nice game with pretty traditional area control mechanics, souped up with random events and the difference between the different gods. Each truly has it's own way to win the game along with strengths and weaknesses that go with it (Nurgle corrupts, but withers if Khorne starts beating him up). The mechanics are easy to learn, the map is of adequate size (which is typically a it of a problem with area control games) and everything looks really nice.

I am not very good at Chaos in the Old World.  I am constantly fooled by players who are trickier and more clever than myself.  That said, I tend to play battle games like someone with a sledgehammer, so Khorne is a great character for me to play.  The different characters are neat because each Chaos God matches totally different play styles.  I like the variety of victory conditions as well as the group failure condition.  Overall, it seems like a game that's got tons of replayability.

I must admit this one is one of the best games i ever played!
I am not a huge fan of warhammer theme but i found out that every god is perfectly made with their skills and strategies to win.

Every game is decided in the last round, comebacks are easily made. The mot important things is that luck does not play a crucial role for the final victory! I have seen people winning even with awful dice rolls (Even if you play as Khorne).

Even if the old world cards plays against you, you can always play to end the game in a draw by playing totally against the others.

You have to play in a group when all 4 players are equally skilled and hopefully with a lot of experience in this game. Then you will have a lot of fun!

Great game with fun asymmetrical player powers.  I enjoyed the area control aspect of it (which is rare for me) and the strategic card plays.

Game that has a lot of random elements and asymmetrical sides still manages to be in the balance (according to a quite large data). Also theme is included nicely. Could actually deserve even higher rating.

The one thing that bugs me is the Upgrades. Some are just better for any strategy. Almost all gods (all but Nurgle) have a certain order they should be picked. I hope there will be somekind of fix for this.

Lots to like here. Vivid (if unsavoury) theme; fairly straightforward mechanics, red-blooded conflict; and it's playable in about two hours. Best of all, the factions are fundamentally different in their approaches and victory conditions. Lots of wary tracking of victory status, followed by sudden assaults on rivals. Game has a satisfying dramatic arc, with tentative placements followed by raging conflict followed by desperate endgame.

However, I have to knock a point or two for the piss-poor graphic design. The map is appallingly disfunctional.

RATING: 7.5
 Great game utilizing area control and elements of combat. The artwork is awesome and even the plastics figs are fairly nice although the Cultist little standards are way to thin and several of mine were broken when I opened the box.

The only issue I have is the amount of errata for this game especially with Khornes battle discrepency.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
Though this game has a lot of Games Workshop theme it is essentially a multiplayer strategic wargame in which players try to acquire a target number of points. There are essentially two different tracks of points, though I am not yet clear if one is needed as the game seems to be consistently won by one method rather than the other.

Each player controls a particular Chaos power, the powers have their own unit types, and sets of cards. They take turns to deploy troops, or cards, to zones, which is followed by battles, and attempts to dominate regions.

Nothing here is really new but what sets the game a little apart is that it seems to play very well with three players. The tactical dynamics tend to prevent a kick the leader effect. So while I probably wouldn't bother with this as a four player game, there are things I would rather have a go at, its certainly worth digging out when you have three players at the table.

I played this for the first time at the start of January 2015, with gamers I don't game with often - and for this reason I don't expect to play again for a long time, perhaps not ever. It was a 5-player game, with the Horned Rat expansion - and it was lots of fun. Bear in mind that I tend to prefer Eurogames and dislike most games from Fantasy Flight - but I don't object to a little bit of dice-based combat, and everything else in this game was right up my street. Variable player powers, mainly manifested in a different deck of cards for each player, lots of tough decisions and tension. I'd love to play this again, and would even like to own it, although I know my wife really wouldn't enjoy it so it's not a priority for me.

(+) Very thematic game
(+) The four fractions all play very differently, but still the game is very balanced: I have won games with all fractions and in my experience all games ended in a very exciting close race to victory for most players
(+) Different style of each fraction increases the replay-value
(+) The chaos cards are evil - in a good way :)

(-) Complex rules. Explaining the game takes quite a while.
(-) I enjoy playing all fractions except for Khorne: I don't like the interaction of killing off other player's units and I certainly don't like dice. Still, the Khorne player is of the utmost importance for the dynamic of the game
(-) To enjoy a balanced game of Chaos in the old world, it is important for each fraction to stay strategically focused. If one fraction miserably falters, the game might become unbalanced.
(-) Some cards in the old world deck are unbalanced and unfair to certain fractions. I'm not so much concerned with luck-dependence due to dice rolls, but I am very much concerned with luck-dependence due to crazy old world cards! The deck also always seems to favor one faction (e.g. if lots of heroes and nobles come out early, this will aid Slaanesh. If lots of warpstones come out, this will be an important benefit to Tzeentch, if the cards increase competition in populous areas, that will be a disadvantage to Nurgle, ...). This might bring a problematic imbalance to the game.

rating after 2 plays (4pl) - 8 - LOT of fun - not sure its a great game but a lot going on and a good thrill-ride of a game - mb a bit too much luck with the dice (if khorne rolls well he wins - if not then whoever he doesnt kill wins) and  feels like a lot of chaos BUT this may become lessesened with more plays and i am keen to play more :) 

rating after 3 games 8+ - turns out we got another key rule wrong for this and last game (not our fault this time - slanesh sheet is MISPRINTED!!! so he won easy both times) very slack by FFlight

SOOoooo and looking forward to playing this with the proper rules at some point ^^

UPDATE: Finally played this correct!! and it was a lot of fun - still a lot to learn bout how to win but it packs a WHOLE lot of game into 2hours. rating 8/9

rating after 1st proper play - 9

last game - i played with nurgle and was v disapp - khorne won quite easily and it felt like there was nothing at all i could do - didnt enjoy it at all

rating after 9 games (at least one with each god) 7/8
this game is a lot of fun with Tzeentch, can be fun with Slaanesh, is a bit dull with Khorne, is (for me) impossible with Nurgle(esp if Khorne rolls well).

its v much love/hate atm - it is good fun but sometimes it feels way too random and sometimes theres not actually much u can do - i still need to play a few games in a row with experienced players to finalize my verdict cos noobies/poor players can really screw things up

16-07-2014. Rated after 1 play. Admission: I couldn't care less about Warhammer and its lore. But this an excellent game, in which you play chaos lords trying to destroy humanity/corrupt the world (or something). It's basically an area control game with some lasting influence in regions that can get you VPs later. 

Each round, an old world card is flipped to represent some event in the world. Then, players take turns spending resources to play cards, put down/move figures.

After everyone runs out of resources, battles are resolved in the battle phase. If there are multiple figures in an area belonging to different chaos lords, they will fight. Fights are very easy, you just roll the dice allowed by your army, and for every roll of 4+ you deal one hit to a unit.

Then, if you have more figures + card value in an area than or other players and exceed that areas resistance (which is determined by a printed value on the map and the influences of several old world cards) you score VPs equal to the conquest value (printed value on the board). 

Then, the game continues to the corruption step. Each cultist, one type of figure in the board will add 1 corruption marker to the board. Subsequently, areas are scored when there are 12 corruption markers (tokens of cultists presence in the region). Only the first and second most corruptive influence score, and in addition the players that added tokens this round also score an additional couple of points. 

Besides these ways to get VPs, you can get additional VPs by achieving chaos lord specific goals (through either meeting specific conditions and earning tick advancements) or by using cards/ achieving dominance over regions. 

The game ends in several ways.. and it's possible to all lose. Interestingly not necessarily the one with the most VPs will win. A more important way to win the game is by achieving dial advancements, these ticks are earned by fulfilling chaos lord specific goals and you need 8-9 of those to win the game. This winning condition is checked first, so you could in theory win with 20 VPs or so, but with those advancements before someone with 50 Vps would win. If the chaos deck runs out, everybody loses.

This game is very cool. Each chaos lord has different ways to win, different unit characterists and different strengths/weaknesses. These apparently are derived from warhammer lore and make much sense. 

We played the basegame with 4 new players in about 2.5 hours, including rule searches. We'd probably will be able to bring playtime down to about 1.5-2hours depending on experience of players.

This game was under my radar for a while due to all the buzz about it, all the great things people have said about it, and the way it climbed so high so fast up the rankings. I usually like playing games prior to purchasing them to see if they're for me, but this one I just never got the chance to even though I tried. So on a rare whim, I got the game.

After my first play, I fell in love with it. There's just so much going on and the mechanics streamline so well. Simple game and just a different take on the area control mechanic. I think I'll enjoy this game for a good while.

RATING: 5
I like area control games, so I was excited to finally try this one.  I like the advancement wheels and competition to be the leader on advancement tokens kind of similar to Caylus castle building, and I like the event deck and how it alters the relative value of different regions, but the theme and graphic design really hurts this game - I don't mind the demon theme, but it's just a lot of elements added onto what could be a relatively elegant Euro if they used a more relatable theme.  The board design is horrible and the corruption tokens must be replaced with cubes (we did this mid-game). I also don't like the magic cards - just adds an additional step that slows down turns and while adding a lot of interaction, takes away from the key dynamics of attacking, getting dominant unit control, and accumulating control tokens. In the end, I'd just prefer to play El Grande or Quebec.

Someone said to me that he thought in COW he had maybe finally found a (bit of heavier) eurogame that he liked. That totally caught me off guard. I had never even considered that this game would be called a euro. Recently I've been playing a bunch of eurogames and COW feels completely differently to me. For me COW feels like a conquest/conflict game with some subtle euro elements woven in. But the more I think about it the more it does seem like a hybrid, leaving open how you see it, totally depending on your perspective. If you almost exclusively play American style games, COW will probably seem more like a euro to you.

I've played two games so far, both of them with three players. Played as Slaanesh first and won what was essentially a draw. The second game played with Nurgle showed to me the depth of strategy possible with this game because I really did not play Nurgle well at all. But after I thought about what I could have done. I like that, a game allowing/leading you to reflect on how the game played out. Khorn had run away with the game, getting pretty lucky with the Old World cards giving him almost unlimited peasants to kill and have 4-7 clicks every round. Of course, that's the wrong way to play, which we realized days after playing (Khorn only gets a click after killing figures from another player).

Now I've played a third game with five players (including the expansion). Liked it just as much, still lots to think about and strategy to work through and build on. Even though I did pretty well (far behind the leader but in second place) it felt maybe a bit crowded on the board with five players. I'm wondering if 4 players is the perfect number. But in two of the thre games the Old World cards (affecting the overall world play for a round or more) seemed to me to affect the game too much. It's not really just that some individual cards affect things too much, it's that there often seems to be a series of cards that together in a row can affect the game so much that they alone decide the outcome. Especially when one Old World card stays in play for  over three rounds and has very damaging results for certain players. It is nice that they serve to create some extra variety from game to game though.

I really like this game, even though the only thing I know of the Warhammer world I learned from playing this game. That's testament to a well designed strongly thematic game.

--Sep2009-- Strangely compelling/horrifying game of heterogenous area majority with some added dice rolling.  I'm admittedly underselling it there, it's mechanically a lot better (on a second play with FAQ in mind) than the appalling first play demonstrated.

For my part, the theme is irrelevantly unfamiliar, while the variable player powers combined with random events (and evidenced by the immediate post-production necessity of a FAQ describing the errata) smack ever so slightly of incomplete playtesting.  The game works (at least when played "correctly".)  But this isn't one I'll buy, nor one I'd suggest.

After several plays, I'm even less amused.  The game requires all players to understand who is leading, and attack them:  but we've reliably misinterpreted the game state and attacked someone else, leaving the winner as the one who best flew under the radar.  Yeah; it's possible we could get better at it - but I don't know how many unsatisfying games I'm willing to sit through to attain that elusive mastery.

I really enjoyed my first play of this.  There is a lot going on and it all seems to be balanced.  Area control and points were not as much of a factor as I thought they would be, but I'll chalk that up to none of us knowing the inherent strengths and weaknesses of the other gods.
This is a nice departure from some of the more abstract area control games.  My only worry is that the fidelity between gods could cause the game play to be more similar than not in spite of the old world cards.

I think it needs playing with the right group, i.e. one that can get into the theme; otherwise its very Euro mechanics can detract from the fun -- although those are certainly well designed (with the one caveat that some upgrade cards are no-brainers to take and others probably will rarely if ever be used).

This area control game was the first one I played in which you and your opponents can occupy the same terrain on the board without immediately having this situation resolved through combat, which I still think is a great mechanic.  I haven't yet played another area control game with the card-slotting mechanic that Chaos uses, which seems crazy, because that is another brilliant mechanic for this sort of game.  Asymmetrical player factions/gods gives the game further points in my book, especially that each faction has a unique win conditions (at least, unique criteria to advance towards victory) and I love that there are multiple ways to win, in general, with the victory points and the victory dial.

I'd recommend this to anyone who likes area control games, and even say that those who usually don't like conflict should consider giving this a shot.  Some factions in particular aren't looking to go out and smash the opposition with the cutthroat attitude which a player often needs in this kind of game, but rather are effective when sitting back and scheming to gradually develop control of an advantageous position.

Simple mechanics and variable player powers give this nice replayability. I was really into demons and stuff when I was younger too so I had to have it.

I really love the mix of mechanics here and each player feels like they have a very important roles to play in keeping the others in check.  If you try to just leader bash, someone will sneak in and win with a different victory condition.  The limited spaces for spells in each region also causes some serious anguish.  How appropriate for this theme.

Enjoyable game which is quite simple, but with quite a bit of strategic depth. Each Great Power plays differently, with no one tactic working for all of them (though, arguably, one tactic working for each).

Visual Appeal: (4) 
Very nice looking game with great art and nice board layout with the power dials. I wish the board used more contrasting colors that just black and brown. Sometimes it's a strain to find things.

Components: (4) 
Would be a 5 except for the cultist pieces. They are so small that the fragile staff/sigil of each piece bends and breaks with normal use and just looks shoddy. The rotating upgrade dials are one of my favorite components in any game because they are just fun and intuitive. Cards are high quality standard of FFG.

Theme: (5)
The theme was one of the first things that grabbed me about this game. Who doesn't want to be a crazy all-powerful being who wreaks havoc upon puny towns and cities? The game mechanisms use the theme well since all of the player abilities are asymmetrical and specific to their character. Corruption placement and domination are standard area control fare with a demonic flair.

Learning: (3) 
The rules have some errors. Easily fixable but something that shouldn't happen with proper editing. To really learn the game requires knowing the powers all 4 players' cards and dials so that you can work to counteract them. I've made my own player cheat sheets for the game to help everyone remember. This knowledge comes with experience, but can be a big hurdle for new players.

Gameplay: (4)
There is a lot of "screw you" in this game. I feel like the asymmetry is well balanced when players know the game well. Certain plays can create devastating advantage against those players who don't know how to counter them like Tzeench's "Warp Shield" or Nurgle's "Final Rotting." I think Slaanesh won by dial advancement in the first 3 games because while learning, we couldn't figure out how to counter that strategy fairly. Definitely a game that changes over time when you play with the same group. That's good because you are often rewarded for trying new angles.

Overall Fun: (4)
This is a great game with good replay value. I enjoy it, but getting exactly 4 players together who want to play has proven difficult. Everyone with whom I've played counts it among their favorites.

I love this game. It's not exactly balanced and has a very high luck element, not only in the dice-based battles, but especially in the Old World event cards, which can all but eliminate a player from the competition quite early in the game. This prevents it from getting a higher rating. Still, it's a game which not only rewards, but requires experienced players, who are able to judge correctly how close everybody is to winning and who to harass.

What is it with these ameritrashed eurogames anyway recently? Lords of Waterdeep, this, just put together a bland eurogame, paste on a well-liked license that's associated with rpgs and other geeky amiertrashy stuff, and presto, all the ameritrashers will suddenly be all over euros?

Majority game in which every player has different abilities and ways to win. They have to adjust their strategy to the configuration of the faction they play. Antiergonomic map. Not my kind of art, even when I usually like dark environments in games. Speaking of other things, the red faction seems very unbalanced in its favor, especially when it is played by someone who knows what he/she is doing. Since putting a chip in the rondel only cost it a kill, it is very easy for it to move it at least one space per turn, and two every once in a while, allowing an easy rondel victory after a couple of rounds. Yes, the game can be won by other factions, but the way to achieve that is not as easy and intuitive as red's, since they have to know very well what they are doing and have a little luck, especially if red doesn't make mistakes. Besides, they will have to watch red's actions to stop him/her or just to run away from him/her. This issue breaks the game for me, especially when the majority of people says that this game needs to be played by four players to be balanced. Although, after seeing red's abilities, I would say that probably the game will be more balanced playing without it.

I love this game. Its design is just so masterful, and it is dripping with theme. It combines so many of the elements that I love from all three "families" of board games. 

Set in the Warhammer 40K universe, this is Ameritrash gaming at its best, with a deep and engaging theme and plenty of dice-rolling combat. But it's essentially an area control eurogame, complete with victory point track. At the same time, it kind of "feels" like a wargame.

You don't have to win by victory points. There are other paths to victory. And the four factions play asymmetrically and yet appear to be perfectly balanced.

I was just amazed that the designer was able to create such a beautiful and complex design without having it fall apart. It is seamless. It is superb. It feels epic, and yet it can play in a couple of hours.

I sincerely hope I get to play this again soon.

Really an area-majority Euro at heart, but the asymmetric powers and cards are so well done that the cubes truly morph into unique figures. Each faction has a point of differentiation in every single facet of the game. Puts all those Euros that half-assedly differentiate each side (really, Age of Empires? Just 1-2 national advantages to call yourself differentiated? that's it?) to shame.

And the Euro mechanisms are completely integrated into the game, unlike Cyclades, where the auction sticks out like a sore thumb. Chaos doesn't introduce anything that's dramatically new, but glues together its thoughtfully implemented parts seamlessly. A true Euro-Ameritrash hybrid. The cards, variable powers and lurid theme scream Ameritrash, but excellently integrated European design principles include:

 - if you fall behind early, cards will favor you. 
 - the action budgeting system (a la Through the Ages and La Strada) results in virtually no downtime. 
 - a gazillion ways to score VPs, but counteracted by a brilliant balanced-scoring concept. There are two often-divergent ways to win: -- dials or VPs -- and you need to equally go down both paths, before deciding which objective to push for.

Rules were really easy to learn, especially with the player aid, and a 4-player game took only 2 hours!

I'm convinced this can be re-themed into a pooping game (the corruption tokens) to show the more prejudiced of Eurogamers what they're missing out on! Or just give it the El Grande Sterilization Treatment.

Need to see how the balance is, but currently it's a 10 from me.

Finally got a chance to play this Warhammer-inspired game and even though it's mainly area control - which I usually detest - it's implemented in a cool why.  The asymmetric gods, advancement dials and power cards are all well-implemented.  I also like how not everyone is working toward the same goal in the same way - one might be trying to get dial ticks, another might want VP, etc.  Really well-done and even though it's a bit long ~2.5 hours, turns move along at a nice clip and suddenly it's your turn again.

An amazing game with a great dark theme. Randomised objective placement makes every map both familiar but different. Asymmetric gameplay with appropriate units, spells and victory conditions that sensibly adhere to the beautifully constructed themes of each of the dark gods is great fun.

If you like adversarial combat, this is the game for you. Half the game is executing your god's strategies and the other half is plotting and scheming with everyone else to ensure that no other god gets too far ahead.

This game may not be for everyone, but I absolutely love it.

An absolute rarity. (I would say a diamant, but diamants aren't rare, just overpriced). It's a rare case of FFG game that's finalized and balanced right off the bat. No expansion needed to fix it. (Expansion is basically complete re-imagening). It's a rare case of a nonbloated ameritrash and FFG design. Of course FFG couldn't help themselves, so the board is illegible. Because: atmospheresomethingsomethingchildishsupposedlydarkhumoursomething.
 
But. It is brilliant. Like a diamant. An asymmetrically cut one, because, well, that's the shtick. It's a DoaM/Area majority AT/Euro hybrid. With asymmetrical sides. Which are balanced. Uhm. Yes, they are. Shuttup, they are. Look. Citow is a gem game and as such is to be properly appreciated under very specific conditions. You need 4 players. Citow does not scale. And the way Citow is balanced is the way players are supposed to balance it. And the way players are going to learn how to balance it is for the same group of players (which consists as we've established of exactly 4 persons) are going to play it time and time and time again. And then some. So if you say this gem game isn't balanced, it's your fault for not training yourself in balance achieving skills. 

I've stuck to my copy which wasn't getting any play, till miraculously a group appeared of 4 dudes (I'll count myself as a dude), and we played it over and over and over again. Pure bliss. (also because no rules explanation). And it is balanced. And games are tense when everybody knows what they should be doing. Because playing Citow is like enacting a theatre play - these Gods are entangled in eternal dance in which everybody has their role and their job in balancing the cosmic scale. Those who say "game plays you" "no freedom" and blahblahyadayada should raise their gaze from the hand of cards and stop looking for options there - your options are the other players.

Fine. Nothing special. I played it with people who know the war hammer universe well and they *loved* it. I do like the asymmetrical powers but I am not convinced of the balance. Would rather play kemet if I was going to play something in the fight everyone style. That said it had enough interesting points that I would be willing to play it a few more times.

[1 play] Rated a 2 because I won't play it again. Period. I don't like the theme or the implementation. It has nothing to offer for me. If it was about a historical subject I could identify with, the rating could jump to a 4.

Not my cup o tea, but I hope you enjoy it much as I enjoyed long afternoons of D&D back in the day, and I hope it is a gateway for you to better games someday.

A nice twist on dudes on a map.  The game has a darker theme that appeals to a very niche market which limits when you can bring it off the shelf.  The game also feels a bit fiddly and some of the mechanics are a bit clunky.  The game is immerse in theme and overall you should have a good time.

Despite the Warhammer theme Chaos in the Old World is (a little surprisingly) not ameritrash, but rather an area control/figure placement game with some ameritrash elements. All the gods play quite differently. You have a fair possibility to win with anyone, which is a fine accomplishment in itself.

The cardboard components are nice and give a good Warhammer feel. The manual is quite well written and has a helpful strategy guide for each god. On the negative side the box inlay is not very useful and the cultist figures are plain shit with their breaking poles.

Very good Area Control game where the 4 players peach play a different game. The fate of this game is many times in the hands of a single battle-roll. 

So stay away if you don't like to put your chances of winning in the hands of Fate :)

The game in it self is very well balanced. But who's winning are mostly the result of Group think.

Every group has some power winning more often than another and the game is a game about constantly counter the others and the "Chaos" that results therein.

If you take the game for what it is you well get a very fun experience indeed :)

RATING: 10
One of my first, and still my favourite game ever. It offers a perfect combination of "take that" elements, with clever euro mechanics and ameritrash combat. I've heard complaints about the board but you get used to it very quickly and then you don't see it anymore, you just see the potential to get your units out there and get ahead of your opponents. 

The game, while asymmetrical, is almost perfectly balanced. Whether you win or lose depends only on your skill. The only shortcoming that I can think of is that the game is only really fun with 4 players. The 3 player game, while possible, just feels like it lacks something. Still, given the option, I'd play this game every time I was offered to, and that's no small feat.

Rarely, if ever, have I played a game where typical euro mechanics (mainly area control) were combined with such a strong sense of theme without losing strategic focus in the mixing.

The balance issues reported are probably actually down to different learning curves for different Powers. There's the fact that some Powers have only one viable path to victory (see the Horned Rat expansion, where this issue is somehow tackled).

[i]Fantastic and Convincing Attempt at Truly Asymmetric Play in a Multiplayer Strategy Game![/i]

Best with 4 players.

Note: Base game is a great framework and an awesome standalone game on its own, but the expansion, which changes the game quite a bit (replacing every card in the game) I found to be more my style, so I maintain a different rating for that. I'm also more experienced with the expansion.

Love the genuine asymmetry, and the main thing this game has going for it is the pacing and playtime compared to other similar games. Lots of game crammed into 90 minutes means that every single turn will be exciting.

Lots of good stuff to say. It's not an epic area control game like Dominant Species, but the overwhelmingly awesome gameplay/playtime ratio makes me pretty much always eager to play.

The Horned Rat Expansion bumps the rating up to "10" for me  because of the more interesting cards. Things I think the expansion does better:

* The chaos cards in the expansion are more interesting. I think there are less useless ones, and most of them promote interaction between players. However, I think the cards are better themed in the base game, which I miss, especially for Nurgle.

* Negates the importance of the dial victory for Khorne in particular. While this may sound like a negative, dial victories are less interesting than VP ones usually, as missing a double dial for a couple turns can doom you. All gods should be able to win by points.

* Expansion has upgrades that are actually interesting and situational enough to not get the same picks every single game. Still not perfect, as there are some clearly underpowered ones, but better I think.

* 5 players, more flexibility, and seems to play better with 3.

* Warriors and Daemons that aren't a waste of money for everyone but Khorne and Nurgle.

Both games are great though.

Base Game: (5 Design + 4 Enjoyment)
With Expansion: (5 Design + 5 Enjoyment)

Nice little asymmetrical conflict driven area-control game.  It's El Grande where you get to punch the leader in the face instead of the gut.  Lots of thought went into making every faction feel individual.  I question whether this actually limits the replayability as factions have a distinct path to victory.  There is an illusion of multiple paths to victory, and it seems that it is just that there are specifically different paths that only some of the factions can achieve.

Not being aware of each of the faction's strategies will lead to a disappointing game.  A play under the belt or some quick tips for faction goals should lead to a more balanced game.  It seems that each player is designed to keep the player to their left in check, so if one player isn't doing so hot, their counterpart will thrive and come into a clean victory.  We'll see.  It certainly expects players to fall on their sword to stop others from gaining ground.  I fear kingmaker situations.

The sculpts are nice (cultists are fragile), though strangely not in correspondence to the world that they are trying to emulate (wrong # of breasts and eyes for certain creatures).  Not a biggie, though.  The board is a bit tough to read, so much noise.  You get used to it, kind of like looking at a magic eye (autostereogram); your mind cleans up the jumbled mess.

A fine enough, multiplayer bash the leader euro-based conflict game if you're looking for that kind of thing.

Probably my new favorite game!  Each play through is completely different. The theme is immersive, and the components and artwork are top notch. Very easy to teach. Simple, but with depth.

What makes it fun is that each game is very different. Even though each race has a basic strategy, small tweaks here and there can make or break you. That, plus the randomly generated world events make the game world different each time.

The game also feels balanced in that each player has strengths and weaknesses can that can be exploited.

Just tremendous production and presentation in this game, and the different winning conditions for each god makes the game just appeal so strongly to me.  Add in the wacky theme and the different strategies involved and I'm a HUGE fan!  Quickly becoming one of my favorite games of all time.  *Update* - almost five plays now and I am completely enthralled with every game. *update* -- I played Cthulhu Wars and now I realize that Chaos might be a bit cluttered and clunky.  While this makes me sad and I had to adjust my rating after a recent play, I did love Cthulhu Wars ..
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wow - this is an awesome game. If you like games that are asymmetric, and kind of Ameritrashy, but with some Euro-sensibility thrown in, you have to play. I really have to give it to the designer on this one - it must have been a bear to create a game with factions that are so different, but play off each other so perfectly. I only like to play it with 4 (i may like 5 - never tried it) so that you get the full effect of how all the Old Gods play off each other so amazingly well - with some being natural enemies, one keeping another in check, etc, etc. 

Actually, i got the best sense of the nuanced card play and incredibly well balanced factions from playing a solo game to test out a custom map i made for the game. I actually played all four gods, and thought i would just run through a few rounds, but it was so much fun and so interesting, I played a whole game! Playing every faction myself really showed me the subtle ways the gods play off each other (especially in the card play) and how magnificent the balance is. This really is something so special - and I have never played a game quite like it. 

My only complaint is that I really cant stand the map that came with the game. Ive talked about it in the forums, but suffice it to say that I made my own map that i LOVE, so that's not a problem anymore. 

Fantastic, fun, dripping with theme game.

I have immense respect for the design of this game, but it's not the right game for everybody.  

Since every faction plays so differently, it really requires that all 4 players understand the ins/outs of all 4 factions:  their strengths/weaknesses, their dials, their unique spells, their upgrades, etc.  Poor play by a single player can radically swing the balance of the game in favor of another god.  

I suppose this is the trade-off of having a multi-player game so asymmetrical as CitOW.  Still deciding if this game is right for my group.

An interesting game that seems to end too quickly -- abruptly, might be the word for it.

I have some balance concerns that might not be warranted, specifically in regards to the Old World event cards and how they come out.  2nd game played saw the "no fighting here" card come out 1st, followed closely by the "only roll 1 die, total, when fighting" card, a combo that more or less nullified Khorne's ability to do anything in the early game (and get out that all important first upgrade).

Still, fun game that I need to give another play to really "get", I think.  I also wonder if I'd enjoy it nearly as much if I played as one of the less-combatative gods...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is an area control game that plays very differently from the typical "I have more units in this region than you" area control fare.  In this game each player controls a different malevolent god that has their own agenda of corruption and destruction.  This is accomplished by either summoning units in different areas or playing "Chaos Cards" into those areas.  The cards provide special bonuses to the player but also adds its cost to the domination total for a region that scores that player points if he has the most at the end of any given round.  The basic figure for each player (the cultists) also corrupt the land and enough corruption also provides players points.

Each character also plays very differently, like I said they all have their own agenda and accomplishing their agenda provides them with "dial advancements" that provide players with bonuses and also getting enough is one of the game's victory conditions.  I think it is rare, however, that the game ends any other way than a player achieving 50 victory points.

I think the way the game plays is very interesting.  There are battles but there is only ever one battle in any area in a given round and anybody left in the area after the skirmish gets to cohabitate for another round.  Corruption is placed by all players cultists in that area so they even get to work together to ruin the land.  I think I'm most impressed at how very different all the characters are yet none of them seem to have an immediately clear advantage.

However, despite how varied and different the characters are and how much I love asynchronous player powers and abilities, there wasn't much variety in the game.  Compare it to something like Kemet, each player starts out the same in that game but through what powers they claim creates a very different profile throughout.  Each game you play of Kemet you can try (and even be forced to) a different strategy and each game feels much more varied and new than this game.  You can try each of the 4 different characters but that provides you with 4 games that each feel new.  After that every time you play the same character is going to feel exactly the same.  You don't really have room to try new strategies because each character needs to focus on one thing or you are just going to do poorly.  Even the deck of Chaos Cards each character has seems to actually be just multiple copies of the same 5 or 6 cards.

The other problem I have with this game, and it is just a personal preference thing, is the game is a bit too gruesome for me.  Don't get me wrong, the art and figures are fantastic and detailed, and that's the problem.  I don't necessarily want to play a game too often where I am staring at a map drawn on stretched human skin or a detailed miniature of a demon tearing his own stomach open and letting the contents spill to the floor.

Any other month this would have been the top dog. Really great game that I want to play many more times. Great that every player gets an own path to victory and different cards that make everyone approaching the game a little different. Bad? I don't know how well this game would play if you are any other number of players than 4. The different paths to victory and the different cards make the learning of the game a little steep for non-gamers.

Didn't like the game at all. Repeated decisions all the time and it seemed (just a guess because one single play it's not enough) that some of the powers have easier tasks. I don't like the theme, I don't like the artwork, I don't like the board. I like the plastic figures which are well produced. Rules are a bit vague in some points but they do not have important problems to underline.

Still not my cup of tea. I will not play this game again simply because I do not like it at all.

Must be competing for the most ugly board design of 2009. Components individually lovely but combined together looks like a pack of dogs have vomited on the board. Another triumph of style over function.

That's the bad bit - the game itself is very good. The asymmetric powers and variety in the old world deck make for a lot of re-playability. However, not giving two hoots for the Warhammer Universe (the Nurgle? The Tzeentch? do me a favour...) I think this game system would have been brilliant if used for a historical game.

When played with four players familiar with each faction, this is my favorite area control game.  Playing with a skilled group of players will constantly force you to adapt your strategy.  Decision trees that you may have made min-max evaluations against will constantly be discarded as each phase progresses.  

Asymmetric victory paths, politicking, free-for-all conflict, and kingmaker scenarios may discourage gamers who favor cooperative games or strategy games with little interactivity.  The number of combinations of Old World cards, player hands, and Old World tokens makes it likely each game state will be unique.

This game is very well balanced for 4 players.  A 3-player game should only be attempted with players who have many 4-player game sessions under their belts.  Players who are experts with each faction can make 3-players games fun and challenging as well.

Do I go for a dial win, or should I make my focus something different at the start of the game?  Decisions like these and some well-balanced powers make for a fun time.

The only gripe I have is that Khorne wins too often in our group because people haven't figured out how to neuter him yet.  At the same time, neutering Khorne is a bit boring in and of itself.  It requires everyone to summon all their tokens away from him as soon as he comes on the board.  I can see that getting a bit old after a while.

RATING: 10
For a game to be so asymmetrical, yet so beautifully balanced is a true work of art.  Top on top of that the amazing, tense game play and the fact that it is just dripping with theme, makes this game a perfect score, in my opinion.  Amazing game.

I also own the Horned Rat expansion

The perfect blend of theme and mechanics. Awesome asymmetric game play with multiple paths and ways to victory and the perfect length. 

The only reason it isn't a 10 is because it's really just a 4 player, you can play with 3 but it's so much better with 4.

RATING: 8
Perhaps more than any other game I've read about on this site, "Chaos in the Old World" has received almost universally effusive word-of-mouth praise.  And that's why I bought it.  And I'm glad I did!  For a game that combines many different mechanisms (area control, conquest, card play, resource management, special player powers, etc.), it is relatively simple to learn and plays quite quickly.  As for the "chaos", the game is a little chaotic, but not to the point where players feel like they are not in control of what is happening.  And as for the "old world", I have absolutely no previous experience with the world of Warhammer, and normally my personal preference leans toward fun and light themes rather than darker ones, but let's be honest, there's something quite gratifying about playing an evil god who is trying its best to corrupt the world!  And all those plastic critters are fantastic!!  If I had hours and hours of spare time, I'd definitely paint all of them.  So what are the negatives?  Well, in my limited experience so far, it seems that players must spend too much time preventing the Korne player from obtaining dial advancement tokens, which takes away from pursuing their own strategies.  And the end game tends to come rather suddenly, leaving a slightly anticlimactic feeling.  Oh, and there's the fact that you really need to play with exactly 4 players.  But overall, this is a fantastic game which successfully bridges the gap between Ameritrash and Euro-style games.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5

RATING: 6
The only game that has ever made me think, "there's too much theme in my euro". It's hard to see the game for all the grungy Warhammer bling.

What finally made me decide to trade the game away was the threat dials and what they represent. By way of context, each faction has a threat track of different length (longest for Khorne, shortest for Slaanesh) and a different condition for advancing on it; one of the win conditions is advancing to the end. In a eurogame, this would be handled with an elegant table of some kind: you can see at a glance who is about to win, what bonuses they'll get for advancing and so on. Here it's mystery meat: a "threat dial" which rotates, showing the next bonus through its cut-out window.

Experienced players know the details, so it's not hidden information. It's just a "feature" bolted on because someone at Fantasy Flight had a clever idea in the shower that morning. And that's Chaos in the Old World in a nutshell: it plays surprisingly well, but elegant it ain't -- it feels like a bunch of different ideas thrown into a blender.

Nel mondo di Warhammer, i quattro Dei del Caos combattono per il potere: Khorne, il Dio del Sangue; Nurgle, il Grande Corruttore; Tzeentch, Colui che Cambia le Vie; Slaanesh, il Signore del Piacere.

Nel gioco da tavolo Caos nel Vecchio Mondo 2-4 giocatori assumono dei malevoli Poteri della Rovina. I poteri peculiari di ciascun dio e le sue legioni di seguaci offrono al giocatore che li controlla punti forza unici ed eretiche abilità con le quali corrompere e schiavizzare il Vecchio Mondo. 

Mentre i Poteri Perniciosi cercano di ottenere il dominio tramite la corruzione e la conquista, devono non solo guardarsi l’uno dell’altro, ma anche contro I disperati popoli del Vecchio Mondo che combattono per bandire gli dei nel maelstrom dei Reami del Caos… almeno per il momento.

Contenuto:
1 Libro delle regole
1 Plancia di Gioco
45 pezzi di gioco in plastica scolpiti
4 Indicatori di Minaccia
4 Schede Poteri

I'm just trying to think if there has been any other game I've played where I had as strong a feeling of "Wow, why hasn't a game like THIS been designed before?"

Plays in 2 hours, 4 very different roles, a bit of dice, great theme, very close which is assisted by the dual victory conditions so that at least 2-3 people should be in the hunt at the end.  Potential kingmaking is usually mitigated by the fact that all placement occurs before all combat.  The card decks are terrific (a few cards are mispriced perhaps, but whatever...), and the Old World cards keep things from getting too scripted.

Excellent game.  I'm looking forward to new games like this, as I think this basic template has a lot of promise.

I went into this without great expectations, having no enthusiasm for Warhammer, fantasy or most FFG games, but I was pleasantly surprised.

Area influence, multiple paths to victory, variable player powers, action points - I could think of it as a euro with chrome (OK: [i]lots[/i] of chrome). The rules look typical FFG storybook, not reference book stuff. The board is one of the busiest I can remember, and some important tokens can get lost in the noise if you're not careful.

Good fun.

 I still like this game, but i feel like we've played it out now. As soon as it's decided who i'm going to be I feel that my strategy is decided and then it's down to how chaos rolls.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Interesting mix of a light wargame with Euro area control feels.

The different victory conditions spice the game up, as well as each player having special powers really makes the game shine.

However, I feel that each of the Chaos Gods are not balanced. Khorne and Slaanesh seem to have a much easier time winning in general. Although I'll re-evaluate my rating when I play the game more. Hopefully we can get another 2 or 3 games in so I can try each of the Chaos Gods.

EDIT: Apparently, 2 of the 5 times I've played the game we messed up the rules and had Khorne getting Dial Tokens for killing peasants and Slaanesh getting tokens for 1 corruption in a noble / hero region. Boy does that mess up the game balance.

RATING: 4
I like it how plays, in theory, and it can give an enjoyable experience, but I find a lot of flaws in it. Many of the upgrade cards will never see use, while others will always be first choices. Ditto with many chaos cards.
People praise the games asymmetry, but 3 of the 4 powers just aren't all that different and are essentially competing in an area majority game. The fourth power is playing a completely different game, which throws an (undesirable, IMHO) wrench into things. Because Khorne only needs to kill to advance, and gains a huge power boost after 2 advances, the other powers must all work on blunting Khorne turn 1. I really don't like how scripted this makes the first turn. I feel like you can't try anything new, because if it doesn't work you hand the game to Khorne.
Khorne also blocks off one of the victory routes. Because Khorne can score more dial advancement tokens than any other power, no one else can realistically go for a dial win unless Khorne allows them to.
All put together, this is a game that just doesn't work well. Combat is a sadly minor and usually self-destructive part of a game that should feature it.
I'm aghast that people talk about how well balanced it is; its almost as badly balanced as a game where people can gang up on the leader can possibly be.
If you want a similar game that's a lot better designed, try El Grande. Its also more bloodthirsty, which is a sad statement.
And now CitOW has been completely blown away by Cthulhu Wars, which does a similar theme and asymmetric player powers much betters.

Very enjoyable, fresh and climatic. An impressive board and fairly good figures (though some of them have fragile banners). Really well designed and rather balanced powers of four players (Chaos Gods), unique victory conditions. A very meaty game.

There is a significant random element involved: the appearing events might change your chances drastically. Also, the king-making factor is not negligible: if your opponents are fighting between themselves, you have higher chances to win. The game is the best with a group of four experienced players keeping eyes on others. If you play in a mixed team (experienced, un-experienced), the game may be decided by a un-wise moves of a newbie.   

Number of plays: 21.

One of my favourites! A great area control game with asymmetric powers, lots of interaction, simple dice driven combat, lots of replayability and an awesome theme (if you're into that sort of thing). The game has a lot of depth, but plays pretty quick (3 hours) compared to other FFG games. Typical of other FFG games there are lots of text driven rules that might conflict with each other so you'll probably have to refer to the FAQ or BBG for clarification.

Rated this upwards over time. This is a game in which the faction you'll be playing contributes a LOT to whether you'll enjoy this or not.

For me, I took Tzeentch the first to times, as scheming and careful 'behind the scenes' play is right up my ally. However, as with Tzeentch it is impossible to win if others are not veterans (so someone will not play their part and allow Nurgle or Slaanesh to grab VP or dial-victory respectively), that detrimented a lot to me enjoying the game.

Enter the Horned Rat and a great, contested, 5p game during which 3 of the 5 players made a shot for the win (Khorne, Nurgle and myself), only winning on Dial victory the turn Nurgle hit 52 points. Great game, if Slaanesh hadn't maneuvered himself into a corner which he never actually got out we would all be taking a shot at the win. 

Great asymmetric game which will compete vs A Game of Thrones for our 'light wargaming' gamespot. Especially recommended for people that dig the Games Workshop universe!

Lovely looking and nasty. This is a real treat to play... a candy shop of minis, different types of cards, counters, power points. Just throw them around to corrupt and ruin and kill! This game summarizes what the Warhammer Fantasy concept is really all about, without the need to buy hordes of expensive minis and army lists and whatnot, and spend days resolving single battles. Just ruin the whole Old World in a few hours.

Just wish I could get it to the table more.  Plays best with 4.  I think there can be some balance issues with 3 players, especially as it relates to Khorne.  My only other criticism is that while the board is somewhat aesthetically pleasing, it is not designed with practicality in mind.  Sometimes very tiny areas on the map have cards and are overflowing with miniatures while some other areas are massive, and in terms of how the game plays, it doesn't make much sense to have the layout as it is.  Otherwise, this game plays quite well, especially for a variable powers game, and it really does well with theme.

I approached this game with the feeling that it probably wouldn't be my kind of game.  I was wrong.  This is an interesting area majority game with a small bit of battling thrown in for good measure.

A couple of things ding some points for me though.  One, I'm not sure how each of the gods are balanced.  If they all win at 25% clips then this game might be amazing, unfortunately, I truly doubt that is the case and eventually people will fall into strategy ruts with certain gods.  This is idle speculation at this time though.

As far as the graphic design.  This game is probably a poster child for how NOT to illustrate a board game.  Although everything looks nice.  The board is a chore to play on, and it's a constant struggle to see what's going on in certain areas.  When I'm trying to internalize rules and formulate a plan, I don't want to have to look up and then figure out what the current situation is, I want to look at the board and know.

RATING: 8
Still dunno what to think about this. It's not bad, basically an euro sheep in AT clothing. But I don't think the replayability will be high as it seems that the optimal strategies can be "solved". But I quite like it and definitely need to play more.

EDIT: Great game with the right group! It's like Dune-light.

asymmetric area control strategy game with theme of the Warhammer Chaos Gods battling each other while corrupting the Warhammer Old World

+ game idea and theme
+ interesting mechanics (upgrade wheels with turn conditions, game changing event each turn, limited slots per region for playing cards, area control with permanent counters and temporary boosts from cards and regions turning worthless when a threshold is reached, ...)
+ good materials, nice but not great minis
- The very dark theme is not for everyone.
- game balance issues (Khorne a bit too strong)
- space utilization on the board could be better


The theme is a great idea, but it's really really dark.

What a great design! Very clear and neat rules, play is fast and full of tension. The factions play differently, there are lots of decisions and interaction. Just great.
But there are, however, a few drawbacks: It only really works with four players and I dislike the artwork and design of the board (minor gripe).
All in all the fixed number of players and the fact that I know a few people who own it, makes this "The best game I don't really need to own".

Another solid game from FFG with a fun theme. Four asymmetric forces duke it out. The learning curve is much smaller here than in say - Starcraft as is the playing time. Re-playability may be less too, though that may be an acceptable trade off for actually seeing this get played more often.

The game is a tactical fun fest, but the randomness of the game could cause one player to be "taken out" or given a pretty distinct advantage. However, the play time compensates for this as it won't overstay its welcome and force someone to sit around for hours on end.

This is a big, asymmetrical game in which each of the players has different goals to score points and to get dial clicks to advance towards victory.  For most of the players, an area control game is in effect.  For another, a wargame is taking place.  It may take several plays to get the nuances of the various races, but it seems well balanced and is certainly unique.

I see some low ratings that seem to be due to the theme, and some stating that the system is "broken". I found the game system to be balanced and well-implemented, and the Warhammer mythology to be spot-on. This is a great game.

UPDATE: Played it with 3 others, first game for all of us. I am the only Warhammer fan out of the four of us. Everyone loved it, and thought it was a fantastic game. It was long enough to really have some long-term plans, but short enough to keep everyone's attention. Khorne won, with Nurgle a close second, followed by Slaanesh and then Tzeentch. Let me say again, all of us really liked it. I am an experienced gamer, we had another experienced gamer, a new gamer, and a sometimes-gamer. We gave the Sometimes-gamer Khorne, because there was less strategy and more tactics with Khorne. Let me just say, this game is great.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After wanting to play it for a long while, when I finally did it was an anticlimax. This game reminds me of why I prefer German-style over American-style games. In CITOW, everything has special rules. Play a chaos card, special rule. Ugrade a troop-type, break a rule. The card at the start of each turn changes a rule. Too much to remember and very fiddly! I'd much, much rather play the simple, elegant El Grande than this.

RATING: 3
I found Chaos in the Old World very lackluster, although the game board and bits are pretty cool. One concern here is balance, and another, related concern is kingmaking. I also found the asymmetrical aspect, which some see as a cool feature, as a bit constraining, as each race is basically forced to pursue a singular, preset strategy. The game is certainly chaotic, as advertised, but the pace is slow and I simply didn't have a lot of fun playing ...

I really enjoyed my first game, where I became the last. I understand now, that Khorne is not my power, because the average result on my dice was about 2 :) I had very few points, and because of my bad luck, I couldn't even tick my dial every turn. But it was a great game, where everyone had his own methods, everyone played differently, and everyone (besides me) had the chance of winning :)

El Grande with demonic violence and multiple paths to victory and with differentiated races that are (moderately) well-balanced.  What's not to like?

RATING: 8.5
Variable player powers that work do the trick for me here. I still am missing out on having played Khorn, but I think playwise Tzeentch in the first place and then Slaneesh suit me best. All three games I played so far were won by Slaneesh. Admittedly, the old world event cards were in my favour during my victory. 

Works very well with 3 despite being quite combat-driven, especially with Khorn around.

During my second session I had one terrible swing of bad luck that really kicked me out of the game. But that's sometimes how it goes in dice-resolved combat games. And with a playtime of around two hours only for a game that still gives you an epic feel and that still gets a movie in the head started without having read or further knowing about the Warhammer "Mythology", this is a mishap I gladly put up with. 

Upgraded to 8.5

Still haven't gotten to play Khorne in any of the seven sessions so far. Probably he despises my pacifist nature and always interferes with my draw of the card(s).

I love the theme. Once everyone at the table surrenders to the notion that they're ancient chaos powers playing for control of the mortal realm, things get personal quick. My gaming group is host to a couple long-running vendettas based around old backstabs in this game. I can see myself playing this one for years to come.

Intense.  A constant, bloody struggle for superiority, in which sudden victories can come out of the blue from unexpected factions.  Well-balanced, thematic, and so far as far from boring as one can get.  Playing this game with people who have played before is like participating in a monkey knife fight.  And that, my friends, is awesome.

Area control game. Play one of the 4 Chaos Gods of the Warhammer universe & try to beat your opponents by dominating & corrupting the Old World. Each God has it's own winning condition.
3-4 players (Up to 5 with the expansion)

RATING: 8
Quick to set up and play, relatively easy to grasp, and a whole lot of fun to play! Downside is the limited scalability of the game: it's good with 3 players, but really shines with 4.

Despite it's simple mechanics, don't expect newbies to stand much of a chance though, because victory can come very fast to the unwary.

Really like this game a lot. Unfortunately some of my gaming friends didn't like it so much, so I haven't got to play it as much as I would like.

This is a four player game. It could technically play five players with the expansion, but that seems to throw off the balance too much.

Ahh yes.... The game of "Who can avoid Red the most efficiently"

There are way better area control games than this one. Look at El Grande for a much better experience.

I FINALLY got a couple plays in! The first play was a bit painful as I was teaching a couple younger players. But, the second play was very interesting and loaded with a variety of confrontation between players. I like it and can't wait to play more with experienced players.

1/8/12 -- I wish I could play this game more often. It's a hard sell because it's neither very kid friendly (for its theme), nor adult friendly because they see it so geeky (for its demonic artwork). Plus, the fact that it's a hybrid makes it difficult to sell to either a Euro player or an Ameritrash buff. I never thought it would be such an issue. But it has been. I hope to remedy that soon.

RATING: 9
As cut-throat as cut-throat can get, but at least you go into it expecting that.

I love the strategy involved in this game. When I lost - and lost hard - the first two times, I was upset but felt like I knew how to be better. And sure enough, I took what I learned into the third game and won gloriously.

Big props for making the Chaos Gods so different.

The faults: not nearly as good with three players, and way too long with five (assuming you have the Horned Rat Expansion). The Chaos cards also need to be more diverse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good fun! Mechanically, this is pretty strong - it handles territory control and asymmetric roles very well. Each Chaos God requires a different play style. Often this results in some imbalances as it is easy for the other players to allow Khorne to win and your group needs to have worked out some of this stuff.

Again, sticking with the mechanics, the points of criticism I'd mention would be:
- there is a lot of public information - trying to remember the combined effects of a whole bunch of special powers, cards, and world effects is a pain.
- the "dials" are really a pretty obscure way to present the progress of the Gods towards world domination.

All of this makes perfect sense given the theme. As it happens, I love the fact you're playing a bunch of evil Chaos gods - if you don't like that concept you won't like the game - and all the asymmetry, bizarreness and "take-that"-ness builds towards it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I admit to pushing this game on anyone that I can get to sit down at it for 90 minutes.  A very fun game that I wish would last a bit longer.  That seeming brevity can be overcome by playing a second or third consecutive time.

Note: First game designer that I've had the fortune to play their own game with.  Oddly enough, also done nearly a decade ago with Mystick.

RATING: 9
Player specific abilities, area control, dice, deeply integrated theme ... this is not a Euro. Typically I hate games like this (hate is a bit strong, but they're typically not my favorite games). Somehow, this one blew me away after the first play. First, there's no player elimination (terribly common in games like this). In fact, players continue to have an impact regardless how far behind they might fall. I have come from behind with significant setbacks on this game, so I know it can be done. Second, the player specific abilities are intersting enough that even where there might be imbalance the game becomes engaging to try and figure out how best to play that specific chaos power. To me this translates as at least 4 engaging, discovery oriented plays (already good in my book). Third, the area control element has layers which allow multiple avenues for domination. This allows for deep tactical play while following an over-arching strategy for your chaos power. Finally, the battles are quick and not too painful. I hate dice. I don't like them any better in this game, but at least it doesn't involve long, dragged out sequences of adding up bonuses and rerolling a thousand random dice to determine some pitiless god's will regarding the game's result.

I highly recommend this game to both sides of the fence for heavy gamers (Euro and Thematic) as I suspect both will find it fun and engaging while also having enough solid mechanics to scratch that mathematical itch so many of us have.

Great game, very tightly balanced.
Low rating because of the rules misprints.
We played the first game wrong and Slaneesh won easily, because his dial requirement was misprinted. Before the second game we figured out something was wrong and assumed slaneesh's AND khorne's cards were printed wrong. So we basically wasted two games because of this misprint.
Not too pleased to spend 60 bucks on a game and they cant print the rules properly.

This is an extremely clever area control game with an FFG twist. By that I mean the usual small cards with many effects and assymetry. My first game came down to the wire, with Khorne edging out a dial victory over Nurgle, who managed 49 points. Definitely warrants another play or 2.

RATING: 8
This game might actually deserve a higher rating - the thing is, this usually isn't my type of game at all, but this game just does it so beautifully that I still enjoy it. The fact that each race is completely different and plays completely differently is just so much fun. each race feels an important part of the balance in this game - Some races focuses on themselves, creating the optimal path to Victory, and if you leave them alone they will beat you by miles. While others have great harassment possiblities and it is their job to make sure everyone receives equal punishment otherwise someone is going to run off with the Victory.

That is the beauty of this - I usually don't like games where you have to attack and harass and ruin someone's day - but in this game you have to!  One races litterally gets its points this way and you know if they don't, they don't stand a chance. It's much more thematic and logical reasoning then in most war and combat games where it's just "And now I attack you cause I don't like your face". The only minor issue with this is that sometimes it feels that the Winner is decided more by the balance of Things between players and not so much by your brilliant secret startegy.

RATING: 5
It reminds me more of El Grande than anything else, with the influence having different abilities.  This is outside of my normal realm of enjoyment, but I can admire the design and how differently feeling and balanced the four factions were created.  My first game had the winner decided because of the order the territories were checked for ruination.  It was a disappointment to have a game come down to that situation.  I'm worried that with competent skilled play, the winner will just be decided by Khorne in an accidental kingmaker sort of way.  I am willing to play this occasionally if someone is waxing for it, and I was surprised I didn't hate it.  I rather enjoy the cultists being weak in battle, but are required to score points.  It does a lot of things really right, and a lot of things I do not care for.  Expertly crafted game that falls just outside of my tastes.

Note:  I am a eurogamer through and through and I prefer this game to El Grande.

If you like games like Dune, this is a game for you!
The production value is very high. The rules are simple and well explained. The mechanisms are intuitive and well put together. There is balance by all powers to be unbalanced! Great stuff from FFG. All 4 powers have their own agenda. It is not a war game, but a game of advancing your agenda faster than other players. You: the player , define your agenda by the way. Each power has special abilities but you need to define how to win. Very clever game. Most games are won by victory points, and not so much via Threat dial, but the Threat dial makes all the difference in the world to win. Very tight game. First time you will play it, you will loose badly.

The rule book is well written and with many examples. Then they made this typo in the player's aids and everyone complaints about it (and rightly so). The Slaanesh advances its dial when 2 (and not 1) or more corruption tokens are placed in a region with a Noble or a Hero. The Khorne advances its dial when you kill 1 or more figures (but not peasants) in the same region and phase.

Easy to understand gameplay with just enough random elements to keep it fresh.  Wonderful concept and execution.

Every game seems to be a nail biter, which is great.  There are always some early leaders, and then people come roaring back at the zero hour.  Last turn has determined the victor in almost every game!

Awesome game, one of my favorites in fact.

My only dislikes are that it only really clicks with 4 or 5 players (expansion included). Also it can run for too long if your not playing aggressively.

As for the expansion. 

I find that the Skaven faction plays much like a monkey wrench in the other factions plans. This is a great idea in a 5 player game. But in a 3-4 player game I don't think the Skaven works very well, and I would not play with them at all.

The expansion does offer some good new card choices. Especially the new event cards, which add some much needed harder event challenges.

Oh my god. Just finished two 3-player games (without Khorne). This was awesome. I think this will be a 10 when we get to play 4-player.

Really impressed with this game. Each power has it's own path to victory, but exactly how you try to execute it will vary depending on what happens on the board. Also, everything you do that drives you toward victory can be thematically explained for each power. Theme and gameplay hand in hand, and I love them both. Does it get any better? :)

Really great dudes on a map game.  The play of the spells is cool, but some spells are useless which upsets me.  

What makes this game wonderful is the interplay of the powers.  This is what you should aim for in games with asymmetric powers.  Each player has their role of who and where and when they need to be using their specific strengths to counter each opponents specific weaknesses.  Everyone must keep everyone in check.  The player who can trick the others into not being kept in check, even for just a moment, will be the winner.

Best of my Essen 2009 purchases sofar. I am not a big fan of Fantasy Flight, feeling that half their games (especially the big boxes) are unnecessarily complex, have a lot of unnecessary components and too many rules that do not matter too much. Luckily, none of these arguments holds against Chaos In The Old World. It feels like a streamlined majority game with multiple victory tracks. It has a sense of urgency that persists throughout the game. It has little downtime and a very reasonable playing time. It is highly interactive without becoming chaotic. It has a great theme that might not appeal to everyone, but will certainly please the crowd that grew up with Warhammer. I loved it with three (upon which this rating is based) and expect to like it even better with four. Great game.
UPDATE: Played the game a couple of times with four and liked it even better that way. Every game was full of suspense and equally liked by all players. Have no choice but to raise my rating to a 9 - only substracting a point for two reasons: 1) the game really is four player only (limited flexibility) and 2) upgrade card selections feel obvious (making the game feel a little bit linear).

Un gran juego, de facciones asimétricas pero bien equilibradas (algo muy difícil de lograr). El problema es que si no lo juegas a menudo, a 4 jugadores y siempre con la misma gente no se le saca jugo, porque cada facción juega de manera diferente, a 3 jugadores no está compensado salvo que los jugadores sean expertos y es complicado de entender para nuevos jugadores. Si puedes cumplir los requisitos anteriores el juego es de 10, pero por las limitaciones que presenta para disfrutarlo no puedo darle más de un 8. 

En mi caso lo he sustituido por el Blood Rage, que es mucho más fácil que vea mesa, es más bonito y me transmite sensaciones similares.

This one just sounds like a neat idea.  Anything with a "Rain of Pus" event just has to be good and it's FFG to boot.

Now that I've seen Scriv's high rating for this and a comparison to Dune this is getting serious consideration.

After one play, it's gotten a great rating and a personal copy.

[i]"Very good. Like to play, will probably suggest it, will never turn it down."[/i]

My favourite minis-on-the-map game, does so many things right that I can forgive weak combat mechanisms and occasionally unfair variance (mostly from the old world deck).

One of the few games to get strong asymmetry right, with each faction encouraged to ensure nobody gets ahead and each having different tools to accomplish this. Gameplay is generally well controlled with reasonable limitations in all the right places.

I enjoy this more than I thought I would, but I hate, hate, hate exploding criticals.

It's area majority, but with lots of chrome and battle thrown on.  I really enjoy the variable player powers, which along with the event cards provide a high replayability.  All four factions play quite differently.  The components, of course, are up to Fantasy Flight's usual high quality, and the theme is pretty neat, even if I know nothing of the Warhammer world.  The idea of being evil gods corrupting stuff is just cool.  There are a couple drawbacks.  The Old World event cards can swing the game a bit too much,  and Khorne is strong enough that the rest of the players usually have to gang up to take him down, though the expansion mitigates this to a certain degree.  This is worth playing for both Eurogamers and Ameritrashers, as there's plenty here for either to like.  Really a tight design.

A very well designed 4-player game that seems perfectly balanced. Each of the players has to utilize a different strategy to win. This game features lots of conflict and bloody battles.  And while I normally dislike dice, their effect here is greatly minimized since only one out of four players needs the dice to win and there are enough bonuses/spells available to make the dice largely inconsequential in the final outcome.

I was apprehensive when this game hit the table, as I tend to loathe anything Ameritrash. But judged as Euro this actually holds up pretty well. I'm sure others who additionally appreciate the thematic and combat elements will go bananas over this game that actually works as a game. I like that the different powers approach the game so differently based on their unique victory conditions. Even though it doesn't really do it for me in the end (perhaps I really do have an irrational bias against cheesy fantasy themed games), I certainly recommend the game to anyone else whose interested.

I love the Warhammer setting and darkness of the game. It is exactly how I pictured the Warhammer universe. Love the different paths to victory and how every army plays and feels completely different. The theme will be a turn off to some. Art and components are top notch. One of my favorite area control games still. Too bad it's out of print and not likely to be reprinted anytime soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Initially, I was put off on this game because it had an area control mechanism, but the variable powers of the races, combined with the various different ways to win the game, mean that the game doesn't have to be played strictly off of that one mechanism.  One can't ignore that aspect of the game by any means, but it's not necessary to maintain control over the regions in order to win the game.  It does require a familiarity with all the gods and their abilities to play it well, so it's hard to judge off of just one play, but it seems to be a nice alternative to strict area control games.  At the very least, I like the mechanism where the players have a certain amount of energy to use each turn, and how it affects the order in which you play your cards in a turn.  It's a neat tension that may not be unique, but works well in the game.

Chaos in the Old World makes you a god. Each god’s distinctive powers and legion of followers grant you unique strengths and diabolical abilities with which to corrupt and enslave the Old World.
\13\
  * Khorne, the Blood God, the Skulltaker, lusts for death and battle.\13\
  * Nurgle, the Plaguelord, the Father of Corruption, luxuriates in filth and disease.\13\
  * Tzeentch, the Changer of Ways, the Great Conspirator, plots the fate of the universe.\13\
  * Slaanesh, the Prince of Pleasure and Pain, the Lord of Temptations, lures even the most steadfast to his six deadly seductions.
\13\\13\
Yet, as you and your fellow powers of Chaos seek domination by corruption and conquest, you must vie not only against each other, but also against the desperate denizens of the Old World who fight to banish you back to the maelstrom of the Realm of Chaos.
\13\\13\
Chaos in the Old World features three ways to win, and gives you an unparalleled opportunity to reshape the world in your image. Every turn you corrupt the landscape, dominating its inhabitants, and battle with the depraved followers of rival gods. Each god has a unique deck of gifts and abilities, and can upgrade their followers into deadly foes. Summon forth living manifestations of Chaos, debased and hidden cultists, and the horrifying greater daemons - beings capable of destroying near everything in their path.

A very impressive game design that features four completely asymetric sides. This would seem incredibly hard to pull off, but Chaos in the Old World's game play is smooth as silk and the balance is razor sharp. It's a little weird to see the dice happy Warhammer universe in a Euro game, but the theme and god powers are so well done that it doesn't take long to completely forget the oddity of it all.

I've only been able to play it once, so I am going to rate the game on my first impression. Hopefully I will get to play a few more times, because I have a strong feeling this rating is only going to go up as I get more comfortable with the game and its interactions.

I slowly grew tired of it after 10 plays, but recently I grew tired of multiplayer conflict games in general.

[i]Rating with the Horned Rat expansion added to the base game (8/10 without the expansion).[/i]

I didn't fully appreciate this game after first couple of plays. I thought it was very good, but certainly not amazing. Well, the thing is that you need the Horned Rat expansion to experience the game at its best. The base game on its own is a rock solid design, but it feels restrictive as each faction has only one main strategy to pursue and there's no way to deviate from it if you want to stay competitive. The expansion shakes things up and offers wider variety of options. New chaos cards and upgrades give you much needed flexibility and interesting choices. Do yourself a favour and grab the expansion while you can - it's one of those must-haves. The whole package is a great, involving game.

Still, there are two things I dislike about this game:
1. Sometimes the event cards can really hurt one of the players (in a completely random and unforseeable way) and there's nothing they can do about it. 
2. There's a lot of maintenance and fiddly upkeep.

This game really resonated with our group initially, we had 4 regular gamers and a couple of them were really into the theme.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It is an ok light wargame in a world filled with ok light wargames.  It has a fun theme, and appropriate, but dreadful graphic design that makes the board really hard to look at.
 
The problem is that there is nothing in this game that makes it stand out from all of the other Fantasy Flight (and similar) choices.  

Also, I suspect Khorne is the man to beat in this game, but I could be wrong.

All in all, I'll play it again if asked, but it won't end up on my shelves.

RATING: 6
Really fun game. The four different factions makes for lots of replayability. None of the factions seems to be too overpowered compared to the rest but the balance of power can shift wildly in game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is one of those games. You know, the kind of game where it's not enough to simply know the rules...you have to know the strategies. And as is par for course with that kind of thing, you have to play the game multiple times before those strategies become clear to you.

See, CitOW is a game that's really intended for *exactly* 4 players and each player not only has a specific set of resources and victory condition, but more importantly, each player has a role to play. Each player kind of has another player that they need to keep in check. They need to know who that player is and how to hamper their strategy. So, in this game, you need to really get to know each player's role, what their goal is and how you fit into the equation.

I make it sound like CitOW is a complicated game but that's really not true. The rules and general game play are actually pretty simple. It's looking at the bigger picture that's the most challenging part for your first several plays.

What's my point? My point is that Chaos is not a game that I think most people will "get" the first couple of plays. Hell, I'm not even sure I fully "get it" yet. But with every play, the game shows you a little more of what's under the hood and, as a result, it gets more interesting. This game could totally climb my rankings once I've really had a consistent group going at it. Even so, I can already see why it is often so highly-regarded.

A strong sense of very good craftmanship: the fact that each player has different powers, characteristics and abilities and everything seems balanced means this game has been tested a lot.
Unfortunately, this game is really good only if you don't mind when dices thwart your strategy and plans. The rules are medium to highly complicated but the game plays fairly well even if it is a bit too long.

Best with four players; When playing with three players, our group found that two players would face off around the center of the board, and one would be left on the periphery (because that was where their power lay, not because they were hiding) and have an easy time of it. 

Still a cracking game, though :)

I suppose the word "chaos" in the title should have been a tip-off.  Stupid me.

Update:

Chaos complaints aside, my second play - this time with the expansion - reminded me of the severe problems with the original game.  It's entirely possible for players to spend the entire game fighting over the same 2-4 areas, and the original balance of the Warhammer factions was seriously out of kilter.

Aside: The dice that came in this game almost always roll a 6 when used by my brother, because of this he has taken ownership of the dice and used them in every game that requires D6s.

After first play:
Pretty good for a "Bad" game ;)
Also more "Euro" feel, not that that's good/bad just didn't expect it from FFG.

RATING: 8
Absolutely brilliant combination of Euro and Ameritrash tropes.  Simple, streamlined, and full of flavor.  In all honesty, people could be pointing at this game as a landmark for years to come.  This is what happens when you marry mechanics with an actual GAME, unafraid of letting the players interact with one another.

RATING: 4
Definitely chaotic.  The four powers definitely play differently, but (in our first play at least) seem pretty balanced.  Another game that needs to be played briskly to be fun.  Each player has a lot of options,  but I don't think overanalyzing them pays off or boosts the fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great theme, and the game play is good, but trying to work out what the right rules are is a pain. The rulebook is rubbish - twice as long as it needs to be and still wrong in places.

Variable players and individual power decks with multiple win conditions make this incredibly fun,  although maybe a little long for some.

The king of Ameritrash? I mean, your dice rolls can crit into more dice rolls! But really, this game is so good at 4 players, that they should have sent you a couple of players with the box to make sure you could experience it correctly.

RATING: 8
only played a few times, and not with enough people.  I would like to play more.  I might rate higher if it played well at all numbers of players and if my suspicions about balance problems were dispelled.

Or if its realllly good with more people.

A great strategy game that involves a little luck. I found it very well balanced after adding the errata, and if you're showing a lot of new people how to play it's relatively easy to pick up during play.

RATING: 9
Brilliantly exectuted, really nice gamepieces. I do like the mechanics. The Khorne faction is a bit too easy to play. Some people say overpowered. Fact is that he does dominate the game in terms of influence. 
At any rate, love this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is probably my favorite game in my collection so far. I love how the different gods play the game in a completely unique ways. I wish I could get it to the table more often. I can't wait for my next game! The only thing that would make this game better, would be that the gods were a little more balanced. They advertise this game as having two paths to victory for each god, but in reality, the blood god and pestilence god only have 1 path to victory. And I wish some of the upgrade cards were more balanced. Some of them seem like they would be really cool, but in the end, they just aren't worth it.

Love the blend of euro and trashy elements. I liked how the area control was on a timer with corruption but you could also score immediately for domination. Old world events add some randomness and ramp up the tension causing you to struggle against both the players and the game itself. I really like how the powers are so asymmetric and take advantage of the VP vs dial tick win conditions. I'd play this game any time I could.

{ P - 3 [4] }

Really bothersome dilemma here in that the Khorne are insanely direct in their method of winning and essentially give the game to whomever they ignore the most if they prove unable to win. (The end to my first game was incredibly demoralizing/enlightening, as the Khorne almost exclusively win through their spinner; come last turn, if that player is unable to win, all that's left is playing king-maker.) Initial board position and spell deck luck of the draw are a huge factor; I played Tzeentch and clearly Temporal Stasis and the three 0-cost cards are all more desirable than the junky Meddling of Skaven, Dazzle, Teleport, or Persistence of Change. (Hell, Warp Shield mostly blows, the purpose of the card is simply that it cycles.) Old World cards recall the environment effects of Vegas Showdown, Game of Thrones, Pillars of the Earth, etc that randomly reward/shaft players. Like many area control games, you win not so much by strategy but rather that you happened to be attacked less.

6.5 after 1 play.

Game components are of high quality. The fixed turn order and skills of each faction imply that the approximate manner in which games develop will be similiar. A bash the leader mentality starts developing through the game. Suspect replayability.

RATING: 8
Nice asymmetrical design. Would play again but not so interested in buying it because I know it wouldn't get played at home much. After only one play I'm not sure about the strategy that is needed to bring the factions into balance in this game either. It would just take more plays to understand how to counteract the other Gods. I was Tzeentch who was a cool one to play as but it felt hard to get ahead over Khorne and Nurgle who seemed to have a more defined approach to victory.

Got a copy on the cheap before the FFG GW split.

Great game! Love the theme, the looks, and gameplay. The only thing I dislike is the usual stupid FFG hobbit-sized cards. The asymmetry is amazing, and so fun, but some of the factions are certainly easier to grasp as a beginner. I found that Tzeench, Slaanesh, and The Horned Rat are a bit harder to grasp, and play well, given that they must chase tokens to an extent. I look forward to playing this a lot.

This one is a really nice surprise! I'm not a HUGE Warhammer fan, so my initial interest in this game was marginal. After reading reviews, I was intrigued. Was able to try it out at the FLGS and I was hooked! 

Picked up my own copy and have played it more than any other game recently! My friends enjoy it and we've found the replay value to be very high. A very well-designed game! I could see an upgrade to 10 in the future...!

*Update...I did end up parting with my copy, but this should not be viewed as any dislike for the game. Folks in my game group HAVE copies and mine simply wasn't being used. Had to thin out the herd a bit...*
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First of all: the theme is great and it works.
Gameplay: it's very assimetric, but if you know what to do (stop Khorne at the beginning of the game and don't get killed by him) the game is balanced. It's very involving and fun to play.

Great game.

As a one time Warhammer player I really like the warhammer world and playing a Chaos god is a good time.  Our lack of experience with this one is showing as Khorne has run away with both of our games... but I had a commanding point lead with Nurgle in our second game and was at least competitive...  My rating is for the 4 player game.  I don't recommend playing with 3 as the game just seems out of whack that way.

The four different gods feel balanced even though their play styles are so unique.  The game isn't that hard to teach, though some cards and abilities led to a little bit of confusion.  The biggest downside to this game is that some of the component choices are rather questionable, but nothing that takes away from the enjoyment of the game.

Highly recommended title.

Fantastic! I love CitOW and the difference in gameplay of the different gods. I think it has a great balance of luck and skill that really allows players a good shot regardless of their dissimilar powers. I wish that the gods weren't somewhat forced to pursue only one path to victory, but it's a minor gripe as this game is fun every time.
The components are very fragile, however, and the board has colorblindness issues in telling where the borders are. Apart from that, one of the best games I own.

Interesting game, oozing with theme and a lot of possible strategies. Very fun asymmetrical game play.

While I like this game a lot, it does have it's failings:
Too many tokens and a map that's hard to view make working out what's going on quickly difficult. I spend a lot of time looking at the map trying to work out what the hell is going on. It has brittle playing pieces, a bad box insert, confusing rulebook, balance issues with less than 4 players and the point scoring phase of the round takes too long, involves too much maths and far, far too many tokens!

All in all a good purchase though. Tedious and irritating at times, but lots of strategy, lots of fun, would recommend.

RATING: 9
Rating after first play. I was a little afraid that my weariness of area control games would ruin this experience for me. But I worried for nothing, there's enough other things going on, that this doesn't feel your everyday euro.

I had no clue about Warhammer before I played this game. The theme is great but has a limited appeal. The game is a skillful mash-up of genres; it looks like Ameritrash but plays like a Weuro. Another BGG user (who rated the game a 1) had this to say:

"This is a horrible game that glorifies evil and suffering."

So, that's a plus.

Nem rossz, kicsit fel is pontozom, de nem leszek a vevők között. Az én ízlésemnek kicsit hosszú, kicsit sok kockadobálással, amit kb. 10-20%-ban hoztam. Ez csak azért bosszantó, mert a támadó Khorne-nal így pont semmit nem értem el... értem, hogy más stratégia jön be más karakterrel, de társaságom se lenne a játékhoz, így tulajdonképpen mindegy is a dolog. :) Ettől függetlenül a játék szép, jó és nagyon hangulatos, örülök, h kipróbáltam.

This is one of my favourite game by E. Lang. What really makes this game such a great experience, is how it makes you act and think like the character of the god you are playing. It is not only the individual victory conditions, units and special powers - it is also how you interact with your fellow gods, as it is paramount to victory that you try to hamper the progress of your "anathema" every turn ... as Khorne you hack´em to pieces, as Nurgle you let them waste away, trick them as Tzeentch or let their own desire be their doom as Slaanesh...

The only real drawback: you need the right kind of players, which can be tricky at times...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This is neat! Can't see myself ever turning down a game... or two, since they seem to go quite quickly. Rating might improve with more plays if replay holds up and a 3 player game shows that it's actually feasible.

At least here in Switzerland, it was too expensive: not much cheaper than Planet Steam.

Edit: Rating adjusted for how much I want to play this game because the play I had was so awesome.

Edit 2: More plays, still the same feeling.

Edit 3: Downgraded because theme rubs me the wrong way.

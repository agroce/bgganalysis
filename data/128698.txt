RATING: 8
Vampire Empire has many aspects of a good vampire movie; the gothic artwork generates a creepy atmosphere, there is plenty of nail-biting fear (will my character be attacked? will I be able to pick up some cards to defend them before that happens?), paranoia (could the innocent maid be a vampire?) and buckets of blood as characters are stabbed, slugged, shot and bitten.

The human and vampire players each have their own, distinctive deck of cards. Each deck has its challenges to play well. Hand management is critical, with judgements about whether to discard cards powerful in other circumstances in the hope of drawing something useful now. There is a strong element of bluff on the part of the vampire.  Is that character he is defending/attacking with/sending back to the city/ignoring a vampire?

I really like the card artwork and the cards themselves are very good quality.  The character card sleeves are a  nice touch. The English rules are not the clearest; I needed to read and re-read a couple of key paragraphs.

An entertaining two player game. I really like the theme. I feel like the non-vampire player is at a large disadvantage though and things can snowball out of control.

RATING: 7
Vampire Empire is an asymmetric two-player game, with one player taking the role of the humans and the other as the vampires. At the beginning of the game, the vampire player randomly choose three characters that are vampires, and the rest are humans. Both players are trying to kill the other players.

The components were good, with ten sleeves included to help track which characters are vampires and which aren't, which is a nice touch. The artwork is okay if murky. The best part of the game is the different discard piles, the cellar (= regular discard pile) and the moat (= trash pile from Dominion), which along with the battle rules can make for some interesting hand management decisions. My biggest problem is with the rule book, which isn't all that well written. We played with several rules wrong.

RATING: 7.5
Mind az emberek, mind a vámpírok azonos kártyakészlettel próbálják egymást legyőzni. A kártyák hangulata illeszkedik a témához.
Tetszik a moat/cellar dobópaklik használata.
A játék alapmechanizmusa a blöff és az időben történő karakterfelfedés és ez teszi számomra egyedivé... 
Nem egy korszakalkotó játék, de mindenképpen a "bármikor szívesen játszom vele" kategória tagja. 
Akár "oda-vissza" játék is belefér egy játékalkalomkor, hiszen ezt bőven megengedi a játékidő hossza. (30-35 perc)

RATING: 7
Will take a few more plays to find out where this one lands, but so far it's a very good 2 player semi-deduction semi-bluffing game that's fairly contingent on luck of the cards in your + your opponents hand.

RATING: 5
Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
Interesting game, but was kind of expecting more from it.  I think having played many CCG's / LCG's, I kind of expect more from a 1 v 1 card game.  The deduction element was interesting, but not as interesting as I thought it would be going in.  The combat system left a lot to be desired.  I do plan to play this one a few more times (as I have only played as the vampire player), but not too sure how long this one will stick around.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Tentative rating after one play, my only complain is that at first sight it looked like the human deck is stronger than the vampire, maybe a little more experience demonstrates that I'm wrong (I'd be glad if that occurs :) ). In any case, the human player starts the game with less information and a high level of paranoia.

Intriguing game with gorgeous artwork, the flavour text on the support cards also contribute to get into a great dark and tense atmosphere.

Another very positive thing about Vampire Empire is that I'm dying for exploring the game in depth so I expect to play this game a lot.

We call this one "Vampire Lunchbox" because it comes in an appropriately sized tin, but without a handle.

There's a good two player game here, but its essentially that both players have full deck knowledge (of both decks).

Two player asymmetrical deduction game that involves no deck building and has some good decision making. It can get a bit repetitive because the cards are similar and not very exciting. Overall, Decent 2 player card game that will fit well as a filler when in the mood.

Decent light card game, which fills number of roles well. It can serve as a meatier filler, a beer&pretzel affair, portable game for travelling, or even as an introductory game when one wishes to introduce non-players to more complex LCGs or CCGs. Notably, the graphic design is up there with the best, making the game surprisingly atmospheric. That tin box!

Perhaps I'm missing something in the aesthetic of the game, but I am really not a fan of how this game looks.  The art seems overly dark and too simplistic, and besides the fact that it comes in a tin (which is a nice touch), I feel as though I'm not getting the artistic merit here.  I could maybe see a white and black color scheme achieving an old-school, Nosferatu aesthetic, but including a bunch of muted earthy colors on black backgrounds just makes the game uglier and more confusing to me.  An unclear rule book and uninspired gameplay only complicate the matter.

RATING: 7.5
This is a tough game to rate because [b]it will never win you over unless you give it time[/b].  By that right, it should lose points.  Games should have a hook and at least excite you in the get-go, even if all its intricacies are hidden the first time out.  [i]Vampire Empire[/i] on the other hand will, at first blush, appear dull, boring, and dry.  [b]It's not[/b].

This is a game that takes quite a few goes at it, playing both sides, to really appreciate.  You simply won't be familiar enough with the cards to read the board correctly or manipulate it correctly.  I'd say two plays on both sides would be the perfect amount of time to know if this game is for you - yes, that means you should be playing this four times before you judge it.

Thankfully, it plays quickly.  30 minutes, tops.  You can get 4 plays in an evening and be none the worse for wear.  Then, if you've been paying attention, it starts to really click.  This is where my rating comes from.

[i]Vampire Empire[/i] pits two players against each other - the humans or cityfolk, if you will, know that vampires walk among them and are out to destroy them; the vampires want to kill everyone or take over the castle that rules over the city.  That's about it for theme.

What you actually get is a semi-abstract game of bluffing and hidden roles.  The vampire player has three of the nine available characters enthralled as his minions of blood-sucking darkness and the human begins the game knowing only two of the remaining six characters to be absolutely 100% human.  The game comes with 9 somewhat-shoddy sleeves for 9 character cards, double-sided with a human and vampire side.  The reason for the sleeves is that only 3 of the characters can be prowling about on the table at any given time.  This represents them wandering around in the castle (whereas being in the deck represents them running around the city).  Over the course of play, the human player will want to discover and eliminate all three vampires before they either occupy the castle entirely or kill all of the humans.

[b]The joy of this game, therefore, comes from the interaction between the two players[/b].  This is not a game that is firmly rooted in its mechanics, table talk be damned.  You are not playing the game, but playing your opponent.  You share the same basic ability to pick a character and attack another one.  This is obvious work for the human player, but a subtle bluff for the vampire player.  "Am I using a vampire to attack an innocent, perhaps?  Or am I using an innocent to attack a vampire?  Or maybe I'm using innocents to kill innocents?  Or how about that guy I just hid in the deck?  Was he one of mine or one of yours?  MWAHAHAHAHA!"  (Yes, cackling is mandatory)

However, it's not just all reactions on the human side either.  They can use Holy Water to ferret out identities, or even use attacks of their own to see how the vampire player reacts.  Once you understand that everyone in the castle is kind of a dick regardless of whether they drink blood, it becomes a matter of sacrificing "innocent" lives in order to find the darker ones lurking about.  Thematically, you could come up with back stories for each character to justify their violence toward one another.

Point is, [i]Vampire Empire[/i] is a highly-enjoyable game of bluffing, misdirection, and twists.  The art is fantastic and macabre, as well it should be, but the theme is just a backdrop - it's a card game, after all.

So, while I really like this game, it does have its [b]issues[/b].

1) There is no safe way for the human player to manipulate the castle.  While the vampire player can discard cards to put people back into the deck, the human player generally only has the option of murder with one or two cards providing an alternative.  That's not a lot of options.

2) The permanent discard vs. the temporary discard.  This is a very weird mechanic and though multiple plays reveal how effectively it can be used, it still seems counter-intuitive.  On the one hand, I suppose it ensures that nobody characterizes this as a deckbuilder, but at the same time, it provides what feels like a needless constraint.  Sure, you can work with it and it works well, but I still get the feeling that it's unnecessary.

[1 play] Nothing about this game really seemed new. 2p smiting cardgame? Sure. Vampire theme pitting vampires vs. vampire hunters? Seen that before. The experience of playing a game once, feeling that by the end you now know what to expect in the deck and have some idea of what might be a useful strategy, so you'd like to play again, but it didn't really knock you out, and time is short, so you never do? Sadly familiar. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A basic dueling hidden role game, my initial reaction is that it does not pay to attack first, especially for the vampire player, but as soon as you defend with a vampire reveal it and go nuclear.

Additionally, don't bother saving cards, just attack attack attack as soon as your opponent has fewer than 4 cards

RATING: 7
The vampire theme, beloved to me, dresses quite well this asymmetric card game, which has a baby-Netrunner vibe about it. The artwork reminds me of medieval vitraux and helps in maintaining an atmosphere of mystery. I have still not played it enough to evaluate its longevity, but so far I have liked the taste of the blood.

I adore the gothic theme of this "Mr Jack The Card Game".
The game is quite open in options and does not lead you by hand to the end. You need to figure out the system by your own and then try to use it for your own. I really like it. And the paranoia that the vampire starts is so thematic and so splendid! 
Great work!

This is thematic - for a somewhat heavy Gothic setting - beautiful, and very very quick game. What's there not to like?

Looks like it is fairly balanced, and the deduction is there but not an enormous factor to the game. It is a nice 15 minutes filler. 

Rock solid "8" for me.

Un excelente juego de cartas asimétrico, en el que humanos se enfrentan a vampiros. Los vampiros están ocultos al comienzo de la partida, por lo que el juego se presta a un divertido faroleo. Además posee una interesante mecánica de gestión del mazo que reduce la dependencia del azar.

RATING: 6
Unique game with a fitting theme. I found it somewhat strange nonetheless, since the vampire player can start fights "human vs human" and get rid of many humans this way, specially if there's no vampire in the castle.

Should be a good game for RPGs and Werewolf fans (which is overlapping a lot anyway).

This was one of my free games from BGGcon last year that I thought I would never play... until a friend brought it down during a visit, and it turned out to be really fun. It's great to play Level 1/Level 2/Level 3 on depending on who you're playing with.

In this game, one person is the vampires (3/9 people) trying to kill off the villager (6/9 people) while the other is trying to survive. The villager player knows 3 of their team members, and the vampire knows who everyone is. The people are divided into three classes: servants, nobles, and holy people. You use weapons and items of your class to defend and attack other players. One of my favorite mechanics that the game uses is the moat, where you can store cards that you don't want yet.

AWESOME strategic deduction card game for 2 players. Way better than the userscore here on BGG. I like the theme, graphical style, and gameplay style very much. Exciting till the very end. Some really important decisions one has to take. Every card counts. Cards can be used in multiple ways. Bluff, tension and mind games. The 2 decks are different and so is the gameplay style. Highly recommended for couples.

I really like the gameplay.  But oddly the theme falls flat... not in the whole paranoid who's-the-vampire thing... which is cool, and i like the calculated risk of revealing your vampires as they become more powerful when done so.

But the special cards in the game don't match the theme they represent at all.  It's almost like the special cards were designed before the name of the cards or the concept behind them was known... and then a bunch of random vampirey and hero'ey type words were then pasted on them.

Almost every single special card has nothing to do with it's title... kinda sad! Come to think of it, even the regular combat cards don't make a ton of sense... why can i only use my rapier once?  What would a medallion do to a human?  

None of the above robs the game of the fact that it's a fast, fun, two-player bluffing game that travels well... but it does make cringe a little.

This was a very difficult game to understand. I'm unsure if it's a fault of the manual or it's just because the nature of the game. For me it's an ideal combination of strategy, luck and bluff. It's sometimes exciting untill the last moves but it can also end with an anticlimax for at least one player. The game is not relaxing and it can burn your brain.

RATING: 6
Vampire Empire is an asymmetric two-player game in which one player is the vampires and the other is the humans.  Of the nine characters in the game, three are known to the vampire player as vampires and two are known to the human player as humans (the rest are humans, but the human player doesn't know).  Players are presented with three characters at a time, and must use them to fight one another, playing cards to attack and defend, with the vampire hoping to kill humans and vice versa.  The human player can expend Holy Water cards to reveal a character's identity, while the vampire can reveal characters to be vampires to use more potent attack and defense cards.  As a human player, I felt a little frustrated sometimes when I had no way of discovering which character was a vampire (or especially when there weren't any vampires in the display).  The game is okay, but isn't anything special.

Very good and well balanced card game. Asymmetrical decks with beautiful illustrations and great graphic design.

We had quite a few questions the first time although admittedly we read the rulebook incredibly fast just so we could play it. The artwork is fantastic and the biggest draw for me and the game seems to play incredibly simple. Not sure how this game will fare over time, but as a two player filler, it's great.

Also, the annoying thing is that the sleeves don't fit into the designated slots so the insert has to go. Not a bad insert, but why include a slot for sleeved cards if they don't fit?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What I love about the deck building and hand management aspect of this game is that players have control over the use of their "permanent" and "reusable" discard piles (the cellar and moat) and can leverage them to dictate the pacing of the game.... They can go on the offensive early playing all their powerful cards or save them for the end game. If their opponent does not make efficient use of their card plays and is running out of cards near game end, the long game can pay off...

I find most of games have a very tense and tight ending.

A very fine 2 player game with assymmetric decks - one player playing vampire, the other human.

Knowledge of each deck is helpful but not necessary.  In any event, the decks are so compact that this will come naturally with time.

There is a small question mark over a situation where all three vampires are buried toward the bottom of the city deck as the human player will need to spend resources killing human characters.  However, I think that there are a number of balancing factors that even matters out should that rare occurrence arise.

The bluffing element adds plenty to the game but I think that the real star of the show is the decisions arising from discards to the cellar and general hand management.

Was very excited to pick this up and really gratified that it's turned out so well.  White Goblin have to be one of my favourite companies - they just produce my kind of games!

Vaguely Mr. Jack-esque 2-player asymmetric card game. Cool art. Cards have various special effects. The human player must find and kill the 3 vampires. The vampire player of course has other plans...

I was a translator for this game.

Cool premise, excellent production, but the game is very simple. I whish there was more to it, more strategy and more options. A fun and very light filler, nothing more.

I like it more in concept than in practice but story goes a long way or me. It is clever, and I have a deep appreciation of the asymmetrical design.  The thing is I'm neither sure how deep or fun it is.  I also think that the end game is a little screwy. What is a vampire supposed to do if there are only three cards left, where two are known humans and one is a revealed vampire.  The story should be that they don't know for sure that there are only three vamps and the vampire should be able to have the two humans to attack each other as before, if not then his hand is totally clogged and it works against the standard rules. That said humans win by exposing three so somehow they should know.  Nothing passes the smell test.  Very anti-climactic.

In many ways Coup does the same kind of thing cleaner with less overhead for more players.

The art has a hilarious Roger McGowen on cloves aesthetic.

2-player combat game of bluffing/deduction, but which one you do depends on which side you play - humans trying to kill the vampires, or vampires attempting the opposite. Also has a unique twist on card management in that some can be discarded to a different discard pile which you get back when you've cycled through your deck. Asymmetrical powers and strategy mix well - one of the better 2-player only titles of the last couple years.

A 2 player game of bluffing and deduction as a vampire hunter tries to find the hidden vampires amongst the residents of a castle.

RATING: 6
Decent asymmetrical card game.  The human player probably has an easier time of it, but it's hard to tell after one play.  It feels like you can save all your best cards for when you find a vampire.  There some luck to that, and if the other player does a good job bluffing, they may fool you.  It's an enjoyable enough game, but the production values are awfully low, and there's no really killer mechanics to draw you in.  The cards are really vanilla and mostly not that creative, and it feels like it would get old fairly quickly.

It's not something you can teach to someone quickly and get a good game out of. You pretty much have to have a "practice" game or it's not going to be fair for the new player.

Nice little bluffing and deduction card game for two players. Theme is fine and the production with steel box is very nice. After several years of play it gets little old but for all those years it was fun nontheless.

Very clever asymmetrical two-player game. It's all about hand management and deck management, but there's also a strong bluffing element. At the start of each turn you can discard any cards from your hand to a "later use" pile, or discard them completely out of the game. So you always have to decide for each card if it's something you need now, if you might need it later, or if you just want to get rid of it permanently. The decisions always change in each game based on which characters are vampires and which ones have been revealed so far.

My only problems with the game relate to the rulebook. A lot of things aren't explained very clearly and a lot of the ability cards can cause some situational problems that aren't addressed. Fortunately the designer has cleared up most issues by answering questions on the forum, and this fantastic player aid explains most of the rules a little more clearly while also including some FAQ clarifications: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/94017/extracted-rules-a-collected-faq

Update: I still think the game is underrated, but there can be some issues where it can become almost impossible for the human player to win because of the hidden information.

Sold.

An ok game, it seems. However, after three plays, I can't shake the feeling that we were doing something wrong - there wasn't very much deduction going on. Also, while I'm not sure what that would do for game balance, I think there should be some means of revealing a character as a trusted human or something, that way preventing the vampire player from controlling them.

Two player card game between the vampires and the vampire hunters. Has a deduction element to out the under cover vamps but develops as a deck management and combat game. Vamps win by killing the hunters or having all three revealed in the center tableau. Unique discard option to either save a card for a single reshuffle or send it to the moat to remove from your deck. Use cards once and they go straight to the moat. The cards are multi purpose which often present deck management dilemma--weighing a special ability with its combat strength value.

A nice 2p card game. The rating may grow with more games i will have played. More you play it, more depth you find underneath the simple looking surface. Great graphic job. White Goblin have also excellent customer service.

Not my cup of tea. I don't really care for strict time limits in games and this one feels way too short. Also the graphic design is mediocre at best and a bit confusing. Sure, I just played once, but I have no desire to play again.

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

A very good filler speed game! Being quite easy to teach, it probably works well as a family game, although the symbology may confuse at first. My concern is the replayability, that is probably very low, but it can really deliver some fun every now and then.

Ενδιαφέρον παιχνίδι λογικής όπου οι παίκτες προσπαθούν να τοποθετούσουν γρήγορα στο ταμπλό τους τα χρωματιστά τους πιόνια, με τέτοιο τρόπο ώστε να ικανοποιούν τους (τυχαίους και διαφορετικούς κάθε φορά) κανόνες τοποθέτησης. Πχ το πράσινο να είναι δίπλα στο κόκκινο, το μαύρο απέναντι από το μπλε, το κόκκινο να είναι 2 θέσεις μακριά από το άσπρο, το κίτρινο αντιγράφει τους κανόνες του μπλε και πάει λέγοντας. Επίσης έχει και διάφορα level δυσκολίας για τους πιο τολμηρούς.

Γενικά απλοί κανόνες και γρήγορο gameplay, διάρκεια παιχνιδιού γύρω στο 20λεπτο.
Αν σας αρέσουν τα real time ανταγωνιστικά puzzle παιχνίδια τότε επενδύστε άφοβα.

Just too complex to be fun.  Conditions are somehow crazy, and the difficult ones are really demanding, specially if chained.  The system used for colors and what each color wants seemed confussing to me.  The fact that sometimes conditions are impossible to meet is not really nice.

RATING: 5
In this game, you have pieces of information about where items are located, and you're supposed to put the items in their proper places based on that info in a short period of time.

Overall this game did not capture my interest or attention.  It just came across as pretty boring, with short bursts of activity followed by verifying answers.   The other problem is that there aren't always consistent solutions, and that bothers me.   That is, some of the puzzles don't actually have answers due to the random nature of the selections.   

So, it just feels pretty unsatisfying, like doing a jigsaw puzzle that mightn't even make a picture when it's done.

Initial rating a 5.

I like the concept, but either the sand timer in the copy I played was off, or the puzzles are too easy. The random setup of cards can vary wildly in difficulty, but you still have a fixed amount of time per round. I'd think better of the game if the rules said that the timer was started once one player is finished.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solo puzzlers are pretty hit and miss with me, and this one is definitely in the "hit" side of things.  Of course, with this sort of game, I think one's enjoyment is pretty tied to how good you are at the game since if you suck at it, you know you're out of the running before the game even begins!

In Uluru, there are 8 differently colored figures to seat around the table.  Each figure has a desire in each round, decided by randomly dealt cards.  So, for example, red might wish to sit across from orange, orange might wish to sit next to black, black might wish to not sit anywhere near red, pink might wish whatever orange wants, etc.  So, the goal is to seat everyone at the table within a 40 second time limit, giving everyone their wish.

Difficulty is pretty widely scalable, from pretty easy games, up to mind numbingly difficult, so you can find the sweet spot for your group, or slowly increase difficulty as you become better at it.

Overall, if you like competitive solo puzzling, this is a really cool entry into the genre.

This is an enjoyably puzzly game which my wife likes (she loves puzzle-y games like Factory Fun, Enigma, Ricochet Robots, Mutant Meeples etc.) The time element is what makes the game interesting as you need to think quick and get an overview of all the cards. You basically all play and resolve the puzzle by yourself, so the interaction is non-existing. You place birds onto spaces on your private board, but do so while abiding the rules of each animal; for instance the green bird wants to sit next to the blue, while the yellow wants to sit across the blue bird but not on one of the sides, while the black doesn’t want to sit next to the yellow, while the orange wants the opposite of what the blue wants etc.! It’s quite engaging. 

I think it’s pretty clever that you can adjust the difficulty (due to the various cards), and that you can place TWO rule cards for each bird – which makes the game extremely hard! It’s too bad that some rules contradict each other sometimes, so you cannot avoid any penalty points, but it’s okay. Cool and quite unique speed/puzzle game.

Juego de lógica contrarreloj. No creo que le guste a mucha gente, pero todos los juegos de lógica a mi me encantan, así que no hay mucho más que decir. Una caja enorme con unos componentes con calidad excesiva para el juego que es, pero mejor que se pasen a que se queden cortos.
El reto intelectual es perfectamente modulable con más niveles de dificultad de los que se consideran necesarios, así que hay juego para aburrir.

RATING: 7
Components: Odd iconography, with various animals represented by bird totems, and not all the criteria are obvious from their pictures. Otherwise, simple and functional.

Experience: Cool, fast puzzle-solving game. Like my friend said, it's the rare speed game where everyone can get points even if they're not the first to complete the placement. It's like having 15 seconds to figure out the seating arrangement at a wedding reception.

Honestly, I hated this game.  It has really nice looking pieces and a tacked on theme that frankly has nothing whatsoever to do with the logic puzzle at the heart of it.  I find tacked on themes in euros kind of annoying - I find it pretentious, but perhaps if they called the game "Timed Memory Logic Puzzle" it wouldn't be sexy and no one would want to play.  The idea is that you must remember a complicated computer program-like sequence of instructions (essentially, "Red Bird = Blue Bird", "Blue bird likes to be 2 spaces away from Black Bird", etc.)  and arrange pieces to fulfill these orders in about 60 seconds.  This game truly felt like being ordered around by an unforgiving boss under a ridiculous deadline - not my idea of fun on my day off from work!  Similar to Galaxy Trucker, the kind of game I'd always pass on if asked to play.

RATING: 5
Speed puzzle game where each player has the same board and same pieces (birds).   Each color bird has an objective card that gives a clue about where they can or cannot be placed, and you have 40 seconds (we timed it) to try and place all the birds to meet their individual goals.   The game's biggest charm is that it is over-produced with a huge central board and cool little plastic bird pawns.   The downfall (for me) is that it is a simultaneous speed puzzle game, and I generally don't like that sort of thing, but there are a couple of exceptions.   At least it is short.   Another big criticism is that the graphic design of many of the cards is not clear and the colors don't match the pawns very well.   It's too bad this part of the game wasn't better executed.   Not really my kind of game, but if you like puzzle games, this is worth a look.   I like Ubongo a bit better in this category.

Love it. We like puzzle games like Ubongo and this is a really good one. Every "dream bird" has a special rule that you have to fulfill (e.g. Red wants to sit next to Black) within a very short time limit. every mistake gives you a point and the person with the fewest points at the end is the winner. I like that there are different difficulty levels of cards to make it more challenging. A real shame nobody picked this up for the U.S. market but it was fairly easy to get.

(As an aside, can we cut it out with the ridiculous themes? "Fulfill the dreams of the magical dream birds around the mystic rock of Uluru?" Give me a break.)

Good.  8 conditions regarding relative placement are presented, and the challenge each round is to satisfy as many as possible.  (If a version of Uluru has less than 8 places, it seems too few for challenge and replay levels.

If you take Ubongo and swap the spatial puzzle for a logic puzzle then Uluru is what you might end up with. Lots of options for adapting the difficulty and having players compete at different levels are nice to see as speed puzzles are a category that easily becomes boring if the players aren't at least approximately matched. Certainly not my favourite category but this is one of the better implementations, and even the scoring system makes sense.

Uluru is a speed puzzle game of positioning dreambirds around Ayers Rock based on certain logical relationships that change each round. I like it better than any of the Ubongo games, which are similar in style. The advanced rules really crank up the difficulty (two cards per bird!), turning Uluru into a guaranteed brain-melter. It's probably best to use a longer timer if you want to try the advanced game.

RATING: 9
It gives you deceptively simple set of logic rules to follow. The complexity and challenge arises from the aggregate of these rules applied under time pressure.  Kinda felt like writing a computer programme with a gun to your head. Fun in a overheating-your-brain sort of way so I personally need to pace myself with this game and limit it to  only 3-4 games of this in one night.

I appreciated designer's variants that allow younger or less experienced players to play with adults. The game is thin on theme but fast playing and a fun real-time frantic brain burning workout for the whole family. One of the most underappreciated and under-rated games I've found on BGG. My group really enjoyed this accessible multiplayer solitaire logic game. I ended up gifting this to a couple but aim to pick up another copy for myself.

Interesting real time puzzle-solving game.

Don't jump into the deep water and try more difficult variants right away.  I've tasted this approach and wasn't quite satisfied.  Easier variants seemed more interesting to me.  Or just solvable/more controllable :>

I'm afraid that to be good on the challenging levels you might need a bit too much of practice.  Something that I do not neccessarily connect with occasionally played, funny real time puzzle-solving games...
That's why, so far, I do not plan to buy the game.

It feels like a lighter version of Galaxy Trucker where no crew is ever lost in space.

The game is intense but too quick for the brain to overheat.  Great way to tame a perfectionist and break any bad habit of overstrategising.

The theme adds color to an abstract game and raises my curiosity to travel to Australia and further explore this legendary landmark.

Quick, short, fun party-type logic puzzle in which one tries to arrange "birds" around "a rock" based on several rules describing relationships among birds (blue is across from red, etc.).  The theme is really thin; I only discovered it when I came here later to comment on the game.  Some of the symbols on the relationship cards are vague and definitely benefit from several plays to get used to them.  The relationship cards have different difficulty levels which can be adjusted to suit the players.  I enjoyed playing it and would play again.  I'd consider purchasing it if I felt I had the right group to play it with as this is a unique type of party game.  My posted rating is a very high seven.

This is an excellent puzzle/logic game.

LIKES:

* Birds are all distinct colors (although probably still an issue for those who are color blind) of sizable length that make them easy to pick up and move.
* Each game will be different based on the randomness of the card draw.
* You have to be able to think quickly on your feet...that 1 minute timer runs out of sand very quickly!

DISLIKE:

* C'mon, this is such a simple game with a short instruction set.  Why the heck couldn't Kosmos print up English instructions to include with the game?  Kosmos needs to learn from Queen and print up rules in several languages!
* This box is way larger than it needs to be.  Could have been half that size.

I am a big fan of the Ubongo series, and (however hard it may be trying) is no new Ubongo. It is a good, fun game, but in the end it lacks the supereasy "let's just play and have fun!" factor because it sometimes feels more like work than play. And oh my, that is a LOT of air in that box, this game could have been MUCH smaller.

In this game you have eight pawns in eight different colors.  Each pawn gets a random card placed in front of it on the board telling the player where on the board it should be placed in relation to the other pieces.  Sometimes the black pawn wants to be in the corner next to green, or the blue pawn wants to be exactly the same as pink, things like that.

Everyone starts at the same time and races to legally place their pawns on their own boards depending on where the cards tell them.  Over the course of a few rounds whomever made the least amount of mistakes, wins.  I enjoy the game, although I am not a big fan of games that force me to move or think quickly.

First impression (4 players) : Rather nice brainburner. You must match 8 birds with  "X wants to be next to Y", "X opposite of Z" etc. type of rules in rather short time. Then for every mistake you get minus points.

I was sad my group didn't want to try game with 2 rules cards for every bird. It sounded so much fun (my brain starts to hurt just by thinking about it....)

RATING: 4
More of a puzzle than a game, but that's ok. 
Have not played it in that context yet, but I guess it can be a fun "gaming evening" game at later hours as a quick filler. It's however lacking the interaction for my taste, as it is mainly puzzling solitaire with comparing scores in the end, which is my main problem with it in the end. For a fun filler with a group I prefer something more interactive and for something puzzly I prefer something longer and more involved.

(On a side note: I sort of love the glass beads, somehow I just thing the birds very "neon" colors don't fit to it very well, but that's just really me being weird :D )

An excellent, light, quick, puzzle-solving card game. Each round, 8 cards are revealed, one corresponding to a particular animal, and players position the animals to satisfy their wishes, wherever applicable. Furthermore, there is a time constraint of about 30 seconds, which makes the game even more cutthroat. The rules are definitely simple to learn, but, it requires a lot of thinking during the game... and for some people it might just not be their cup of tea. I find it very entertaining, as I enjoy such placement puzzles.

This would be a very good game if it weren't so visually daunting.  The color of the "neutral image" on the card is too close to either white or yellow (should be just a dashed-line outline) and the corner iconography is horrid (looks like it means diagonally opposed and in no way incites the notion of "connected immediately by a line around a corner, any corner").  I'm not the only one who had trouble with this, so it's obviously something that could use some work.  Otherwise, it would probably rate a 7 or better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Amazing game, very nicely produced and who can say no to a multitude of colorful birds and glass beads?

As a game, it's a bit unique, because there's no player interaction at all (you can play solo too) - it's just a puzzle solver, that every player has to do on his own. Each rounds lasts 30 secs that feel like 10s and you're always in hurry. Placing birds is a nice puzzle and the game can be adjusted to be either quite easy or insanely hard :). Another unique solution allows advanced players to play together with less skilled (i.e. parents with children) - the board allows for double placement and puzzle have different levels, so players simultaneously do the puzzle, but parents use harder cards while kids do easier. 

I like pattern recognition, and here it's very well implemented. There are some "choke" scenarios you can encounter, but rules also tackle them nicely. 

Plays very quickly and never frustrates - you're almost guaranteed to "score" some beads. The fun and laugh is usually and checking the birds' wishes against your board.

wow after one play solo with easy I find it pretty difficult.  The timer is only 45 second which leaves little to to change this once you commit.  I really like the puzzle aspect and I'm sure I will get better as time goes on.   This truly a puzzle with pressure. After a few plays this is still hard even on easy level but it good quick fun that really has no relevance to the theme but is a good puzzle solving as a solo.  Great because you can just pick this game and play very little set up time. Thanks secret Santa 2011

This fits firmly in the family timed puzzle category with Ubongo. However whereas Ubongo is either a success or fail proposition here in Uluru there are different levels of success or failure. Or should I say different levels of failure? I like this scoring system better than in Ubongo.

Like in Ubongo you can adjust the difficulty of the game to suit different ages or levels of players. In Uluru you can fine tune that adjustment in a more satisfying way.

A very good family game that is quick to play if your family is the type that likes puzzles and doesn't find timed puzzles too stressful.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a fun logic-puzzle-solving game where people are simultaneously trying to solve a puzzle created by a randomly chosen set of rules. Players each have a set of colored bird tokens, and a player board showing spots on a square around the edge. The rule cards, available in 5 different difficulty levels, specify rules for the positions of those birds. The rules range from something as simple as "next to blue" or "opposite white" to things like "the opposite of whatever the pink bird wants" ... or worse!  All this is being done under the gun: a sand timer is counting down the (45) seconds! After time runs out, players check their placements, earning penalty points for every error. After a set number of rounds, the player with the fewest penalty points wins!

My one play was challenging, but I think this is something I could be good at eventually! At least, without the time pressure. Of course, without that this wouldn't be nearly as light-hearted fun -- it would just be a puzzle! I wouldn't mind playing this some more!

Good looking filler that is both more original and more interesting than its direct competitor Mondo. During our first play, we felt like we did not get enough time to really give the puzzles our best, but during our second we already got better at it and our scores were really close. My only complaint is that the yellow and orange birds really resemble each other on the cards, which may cost you a valuable second or two during the game.

A variant of Mensa puzzles where certain rule sets govern placement of pawns on the board such that each pawn obeys a their own placement rules without violating rules for other pawn placements. Each violation of a rule that results in an incorrect pawn placement will results in a penalty point. Fewest penalty points win the game. At first blush, this game is an absolute brain burner. However, with the simple rule set, it was not too bad. However with the advanced board, there was a certain complexity. The  rules printed on each card can be confusing, but upon repeated plays, these symbols should be evident. Just need some time to wrap your head around it. However, the color differences are horrendous. The color scheme is confusing with red/orange/pink colors too close to one another. Since there is a speed component in this game, being able to sort out the colors promptly is essential. 

To give the game due credit, it is certainly unique and quite an innovative puzzle. Folks who love Mensa based puzzles with rule set limitations should enjoy this game. For the casual gamer, it is likely to be a play before purchase decision.

RATING: 6
A bit of a dissapointment as I usually like this kind of abstracts. The 'theme' is very disconnected and the original theme would have supported the game play much better (although salewise I can see why the current one was chosen). 

The biggest problem for me was that that the symbols in the cards are not all very clear. For such a simple game, and clever concept, the cards should be more easy to understand quickly. Also, the colors of the pawns did not match the pictures perfectly. These kind of shortcoming in the physical execution distract the game play and make it harder than it should be. It wouldn't matter that much for some other game, but this is a speed game...

The rules that dictate to you how to pose your little colorful birds and the changing positions of them offer a great amount of replayability but... it is pretty much the same thing in every new game. Beware of the fact that placing a bird may have as a result more penalty markers than the opposite. I personally don't find it exciting, but if you like puzzles and riddles, you should give it a try.

Wow, this gets fabulously convoluted, even compared to its little brother, [thing=136284][/thing].  You have 8 birds instead of 6.  The difficulty of the cards ranges from 1–5, instead of just 1–3.  Theoretically, you're supposed to use a sand timer, but you'd need a judge; the game is too intense for any player to see that it's run out.  Also, depending on your players, li'l brother's "last player gets a countdown from 10" rule seems much more friendly.

In any event, this game offers levels of handicapping, and total fun.  For how brutal speed puzzle games are, this modern game of seating everyone around the table according to their preferences is shockingly accessible… which makes me really happy, because I love it.

Good abstract where you slide tiles do form patterns, it is very spatial. The addition of "special power" cards jog the mechanism in a good way, but I think it might be too caotic with 4 players.

So that is where Tash-Kalar found its basic mechanism. I have to sag I prefer the simplicity of this design. Although it is to light for a multiplayer game and to easy and random for a good two player abstract.

I really like abstracts. My girlfriend not so much, but she somehow liked this one.

RATING: 3
One of the few games I haven't rated after my initial impression. The game was intriguing with two players, but seems like it will be a lot more fun with a full table. Waiting until I play it with four before giving the game my first rating. 

I found the indirect player interaction throughout the course of an abstract game deeply frustrating. It mixes a game of pattern-building, forethought and skill with HUGE amounts of luck and take-that moments, making the game feel like it drags a little. I can definitely see the appeal, but certainly not mine or my group's cuppa.

Puzzle game in the same genre as Kinizia's game Kingdoms. I would play again if someone brought it to the table, but I wouldn't suggest it for a game I would want to play.

A nice, quick playing abstract tile moving/flipping game to make secret patterns.  Big on fun and super portable.  Very re-playable.

Decent little filler with great bits.  Played with 2 - 3 might be ideal?  4 would likely be too chaotic.  Need to try with more than 2.

Codinca doesn't strike me as a particularly good two-player game, it's too easy to work out the intention of the other players and counter them if you have the more optimal goals.  This is a three-player game, two is too predictable, four is too chaotic and unstrategic.

The one time I played this we played one rule wrong and it made the game completely dull. I'd be willing to try again with the correct rules but I don't see much hope for my rating to improve much.

RATING: 6
I was attracted to the small package and footprint, the nice bits and quick play. Sam Healy's adoration of it also piqued my curiosity. Having played it a few times, though, I think it's nice, but even with the small footprint I guess I'd rather have picked up an even cheaper, smaller and faster puzzle-y abstract, like say Okiya, to scratch that same itch.

Really cool game...played it at Q-Con.Kicked ass. Sort of two to four player chess, bit like a Star Trek thing going on, but Mayan in style.
I can't wait until the full production issue comes out.
A great wee game, quick, light, challenging, simple very strategic.
Sheer genius!

Codinca is an abstract puzzle game for 2 to 4 players. It's portable, easy to teach and quick to play. Each player gets 4 configurations which he/she must complete by swapping, flipping or using special cards which have a larger effect.

The new version is well produced.

Without a clear idea of my opponent's goal I was left with an odd feeling. I was trying to pursue my own goals and my opponent was getting in my way, but I'm not sure if it was on purpose or if we were simply going towards intersecting goals. 
This is a kind of player interaction I don't enjoy.

Not bad, very simple game. Not sure how much player interaction there is. Of course, you can screw others, but it seems to be always accidental. The card quality for the new edition is pretty mediocre, too thin.

Initially looks quite elegant, but it unveils a lot of weird exceptions at odd points in the rules. Secret goals and powerup cards add a bit too much luck for players who happen to draw symbiotic ones.

Pleasant little game of manipulating tiles to form patterns. With two players it's probably a little too easy. Also, the fact that you can play multiple special cards on a turn is phenomenally powerful.

We were delighted with the response from gamers at Spiel 12, Essen to Codinca.
We had a couple of gamers who came back on the Sunday to tell us it was the best new game they had played in the four days by far. Thank you very much for your kind words.
We love it too.

I'm not really a big fan of pure abstract games, as it encourages my chess brain to calculate every eventuality. However, my wife picked this up because of the beautiful pieces and art. The tiles are very nice and this plays fast enough, especially with 4, that I'm happy to play this on occasion. Plus the neat magnetic-lid box makes it tiny to store!

RATING: 2
This is pretty awful. Very easy to score cards without much effort at all. Some can be scored right from the get-go. I imagine that this would be better with more players, because with only two, this game can be over with in literally a couple of minutes. I'm not a fan of abstracts normally, but this is easily the worst one I've come across.

UPDATE: I think I may have played the rules for this incorrectly, but I don't have much desire to play again at all.

2-4p abstract race to complete your hidden goals. Tiles are double sided. I think the first edition printing wasn't the greatest and there is discoloration. The main reason I didn't pick it up at Essen. I might wait for a second print run and see if the colors turn out better. I did quite enjoy this small abstract game. I would definitely be very interested in playing with more players so the board is changing a lot before your next play. Very interesting and enjoyable for a fast filler.

Nov '12: I didn't love this one at Euroquest. It was a good game but it's not the way I think.

RATING: 6
I like the concept of this game. It did seem almost too easy to get the goal cards accomplished (from a 3 player experience). Also, without knowing what goal the person that is ahead of you is going for, its practically impossible to know how to block them... and might actually be helping them in the process. It might have to be a 4 player game to have more pieces get moved between your turns and make it harder to complete goals.

When I received this game via FedEx I couldn't believe how small the box was!! lol. Despite it's small stature, it was a fun abstract game. The problem is that I played it a few times and have no real desire to play it much...just another abstract.

We're not normally abstract fans but we've been trying to experiment more. We played this as a 2p and I honestly have a hard time thinking about playing it with more. Just short enough to not become overly burdensome when playing with the AP-impaired.

Provisional rating, one play. I feared this would become frustrating, often getting close to a target shape just to have another play undo your preparation.  If anything, it was too easy to get to your objective with the help of the special cards.

Fun abstract game.  what I like is that it is an abstract game for more than 2 people.  Its nice to have one to bust out when I have 3 or 4.  I like how the game is simple to teach with only a couple of moves, but the game play is so deep.  The spirit cards add a layer to the game that makes it really interesting.

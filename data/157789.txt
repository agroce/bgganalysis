A great stand alone card game where you play the disease trying to survive the cd a attempt to exterminate you and score the most points (dead humans). I have had more success getting this to the table than regular pandemic lately.

RATING: 6
Well designed game.  Very difficult to strategize out.  Most common stategy we have to date is to boost incubation up to level 3 and infection to at least level 2.  Beyond that you want to try and time your placements for cross bones and diversify.

Love the theme for this one; it's just awful enough.  It's also a much faster game than smash up (yay!)  The only down side so far is it looks like there's always a "most optimal move" each turn.  More plays will tell...

Not much going on here, place cubes and score points. A very different game from Pandemic. It really feels that the core inspiration was simply "Let's come up with a Pandemic game where you ARE the disease". Alternatively the Pandemic name was tacked on to boost sales. Whatever the case it's kind of boring and doesn't live up to the name.

Boring.  Very abstract, and the theme is virtually meaningless.  I in no way felt I was spreading "my" disease around trying to beat other diseases.  All I was doing was putting colored cubes on unthematic city cards that went away when the card was full.  This in no way rivals Pandemic and was very disappointing.

This one was a big disappointment as the premise was an interesting spin on Pandemic. Instead, it's just a generic cube pusher that offers no interesting choices from turn-to-turn and could have been about anything. Might play this on occasion to see if our impressions change but it's going to be hard to convince ourselves to spend time on this one.

This is a pretty fun game that is unfairly compared to Smash Up. It shares a similar scoring mechanic, but that's it. It also is unfairly judged next to it's older cousin game of which it shares the same name with. This game may not be the all time classic that Pandemic is, but it's still a fun game in it's own right. It's very light and can be played in around 30 minutes, but it still offers some satisfactory decision making.

Serious issues with the mechanics of this game but still I had fun playing it.  Resistance, Incubation, and Infection you play pretty much the same every game, which is this game biggest downfall. For example, there's absolutely no reason to raise your resistance above 1-2 during the entire game. What cities you choose to infect is probably the best aspect of this game.

3 player game. We did not enjoy this game very much at all. It seemed like there was no time to get your cubes into the cities before the game ended. I tried to build up my "technologies" early, but by the time I had them built up, the game was over. I am thinking about 2 house rules to this for our next game:

1. 3 actions per player instead of 2.
2. Add an extra set of 2 yellow and 1 blue card, giving 4 extra rounds.

It seemed like you needed to time everything so you didn't have much on the board at the time the World Health cards appeared. Meaning it was a cycle of build up, clear out, and then wait to build again. This also has an area control aspect to it which I'm realizing I'm less and less of a fan of. It's not a horrible game and I'd play it again.

2014. Z-man. AVOID. Stand-alone game in which you play the disease. Supposedly pretty bad (per DanF & GregP & other BGGers respected by me).  Dry, bland, boring, rich-get-richer, too much luck of the draw, too much drawing cards as your one action (roughly 1/3 of the game turns), and too few meaningful decisions. Simple and clean area majority which is both the beauty and curse of the game.  Also, there's apparently no way to remove opponents' cubes from cities (to mess with the area majority) so you're just plodding forward trying to grab small cities fast for the biggest return on investment and bonus action gains. Seems to be little/no value in increasing your resistance trait (1 of 3 traits) because of the nature/timing/flow of the game and the difficulty to get more cards into your hand (they are spent as quickly as gained).

This is a nice and quick reverse pandemic game, not too complicated but has some good choices in it.  Would rate it higher if the options for your disease was better thought out because all you need is more cards and more cubes and can ignore the protection.  WHO cards can be vicious and pushes you to complete cities instead of just sitting out there for scoring.

Wasn't super impressed with this pandemic title. I love the thematic reversal but the actual gameplay feels very scripted and detached. I never felt like a tiny virus destroying huge cities... I felt like I was a guy drawing cards and placing cubes to win area control... plus there just weren't very many meaningful choices to be made.

If you win, less people die. What a cruel and bizarre theme for a "game". That it is one of the most popular titles and available everywhere is a sad testimony to the state of modern society; how will people feel about owning this when the next massively fatal and contagious disease hits?

I have nothing against science or reality based games - for a title which is far less morbid there is Stop the Germs (PNP): https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142902/stop-germs and
Virus! https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180020/virus

There is also Healing Blade:

https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/179322/healing-blade-defenders-soma

Pandemic is a perfect example of what unfettered capitalism and mob mentality inflicts on all of us - there are many ways to make a game about the same subject matter (I live not much more than walking distance from the CDC and count many epidemiologists there as close friends) morally and in a way that respects life - in the case of Pandemic, simply changing fatalities to number of infections would be a start. Infectious diseases do not exist outside the context of global politics and society and Pandemic's crass and banal approach to the inequalities of our world is simply repugnant. 

It's also a poor game as pointed out by many other reviewers. Barnes and Noble, how I loathe thee for popularizing such thoughtless "games".

Fairly tentative rating.

The way you collect cards and react to events isn't in itself very interesting, but there's some satisfying strategy surrounding scoring and the turn limit makes for a lot of lovely pressure.

The result is a fairly inoffensive, but surprisingly engaging little game. It's hard to recommend buying, but not hard to recommend trying it out if you've got the opportunity.

Pandemic Contagion is actually played quite differently from its Big Brother Pandemic. Therefore I can't guarantee that you will love it as much as the original. I like the competitive aspect and think it puts an interesting spin on the game, so I do enjoy it as much as the original. Gameplay is not overly long, and it is fairly easy to learn.

Just the theme is fantastic.  The game plays a lot like smash up, or a simpler version of smash up I should say.  You are a disease, you try to wipe out cities, fight for domination with other diseases, adapt your infection rate and your resistance while puny humans try to pointlessly eradicate you.

If you want a nicely themed reverse pandemic with a little strategy and competitiveness, this one is for you.

A bit lacklustre majorities game which probably owes more to its connection to Pandemic than its own mechanical merits. Granted, I like the big wink hiding in the game's subtitle [i]You are the disease, there is no cure[/i] but that gets old after the initial chuckle wears off. A game ought to be strong enough to stand on its own two feet, and this is where Contagion lets me down to some extent. The majorities are simple and clean, so no problems there, really, but at the same time that's all they are: simple and clean. It takes ages to get the characteristics of your disease anywhere, mostly due to a combination of the limited card draw and relatively expensive actions which see the cards disappear nearly just as quickly as they come in. It's a bad sign when at least 1/3rd of all your actions in the game [i]has[/i] to be 'draw cards': the action is devoid of interest and automatic. Because players cannot remove infection cubes of other players, the game has a very solitary feel to it; adding insult to injury there doesn't seem to be more to the game than trying to infect small cities quickly and build up a VP lead before someone taking the long haul approach of maxxing out Incubation and Infection levels and then eradicating cities nearly in single turns flat can amass too many VPs. Investing in strong Resistence doesn't quite seem worth it, especially given the lousy card draw numbers. 

I don't think this game is going to stay long in my collection, I fear: it lacks bite and staying power.

Spread the disease! 

Turning the idea of Pandemic on it's head, you now play the diseases, and you're trying to mutate into those highly lethal states that let you kill millions of people. 

I love how the setup of this game randomly determines how many bonus points will players get, as well as the strategic choices of mutation vs spread. 

I have a suspicion that the rating of this game may drop slightly as time goes on, if only because at the moment, I think that there's one obviously good strategy. But there may be different ones that I haven't spotted yet.

My initial rating for this game is a little harsh, but I might feel differently upon repeated plays. The main reason is the rules get rather confusing (which is atypical of the Pandemic family), but most confusing is the iconography on the cards. There are numbers at top right which represent several things and it's just crying out for more clarity.

The production values are nice, however. And we did enjoy flipping the Pandemic idea on its head by trying to destroy cities!

This game won me initially on theme alone: you are one of the diseases from Pandemic, infecting as many as possible. This is about the only thing the game's got going for it.

Progression is pretty obvious - if my memory serves, it's normal for many players to make significant progress on their disease upgrades. Not a lot unique here, gameplay-wise. I'd only take it if you're super into the theme and are looking for a simple experience.

Played with my wife and we had a good time.  There is a lot to keep track of and Over the three games we played we got better at it but still felt like occasionally we let stuff slip by that we shouldn't have.  Will try it with 3 players and see if that helps a little.

I don't like the theme, I love it, but as I thought from watching video reviews, it's a pretty random game.

Also, the very first move must be to up your card drawing ability, as you need them for everything.

Still a fun game, but mainly because of the theme.

RATING: 6.5
A light area majority game with resource management (cards)

Slight advantage to start player somewhat mitigated by small bonus for being last player to place a cube on a City to complete it.

Some randomness (cards), mitigated by possibility of using two cards of any color to count as one card of the color of your choice.

Upgrades (3 categories) are great to get but cost you resources (cards) you can ill afford to use.

Events could be good, but WHO cards can be painful especially the ones forcing you to discard cards.  Investing in defense (virus upgrade) costs cards but will save you from loosing cards or virus (cubes).

All in all an Ok to good euro which might be considered as a filler by some.

Only one play (3 players) but everyone enjoyed it (including two teens).

I like the theme of playing as the disease, it's a novel take on pandemic

Strip that away and it's sort of like an area control game (as soon as an area is won, it is scored and removed) with very basic abilities: draw cards, infect a city, upgrade technology (card draw, infection rate, defense against event cards). The event cards at their worst remove disease cubes from each player on the board, at their best they're just fluff.

The event cards can be pretty iritating, the rest of the game is just ok, nothing amazing.

There are some very good fillers out there, with lots of interesting decisions crammed into them, this is not one of them. However I'm sure that those that just like to enjoy the experience of playing a game will enjoy this more than me.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (May 2017)

I heavily dislike Pandemic so my desire to play Pandemic: Contagion was very low. I only played it because my gaming system chose the game and it was a (somewhat) better experience than expected, but still not a game for me.

The rules of the game are very easy to teach. You can teach them under 5 minutes. Playtime is around 45 minutes.

I love the theme, but you don´t feel it through the game. 

Pandemic: Contagion is a competitive game, I was expecting a cooperative experience but it isn’t. Not that this is an issue in any way, I like both kind of games, it is just a bit weird. Pandemic and Pandemic: Contagion don´t have anything in common but the theme. 

The game´s components are good. The player´s boards are great. The cards are very similar to Pandemic.

The luck factor is high, but you can mitigate it a bit. Two cards of any color equals the color you need. There is also luck with the event deck, but you can prepare for it with your resistance rating. To summarize, the luck factor, although high, is not out of control. Besides, the game plays very quickly, so I have no issues here.

The decisions needed to play the game aren´t complex, in fact they are pretty straightforward and simple. Each turn you can do two out of three actions, you can draw cards, you can infect a city (area control)  or you can mutate. You need to think a little bit about what you are going to do, but the game is on the lighter end of the spectrum. It seems Pandemic: Contagion is very fragile, if a player makes a mistake it will benefit another player enormously, perhaps it has king making issues as well.
  
Bottom line, Pandemic: Contagion is an ok family game, but it is way too light for my current tastes. It plays fast and its decisions aren’t very complex. I prefer it to regular Pandemic, but there is no relation between both games. I already sold it. Not very fun for us.

Use the Pandemic board in a completely different way: this time around, you play the viruses working against a deck of human achievement events instead. The viruses are tracked with small plastic cubes.

Good but not great. It's a fun and short area majority game, and it's certainly polished, but card draws have a rather significant impact on the game. While coloured cards can be spent on multiple things, their actual usefulness will vary significantly throughout the course of the game. Thus, players who draw the right cards when they are most useful will have a significant advantage over those who don't.

Still, it's fun, short and light-hearted, so will play if asked.

Besides the theme and the action point allowance, this hand management and area control game is nothing like regular Pandemic. Many other games do area control better, but this game is really easy to learn, plays quickly, and has a unique theme.

I like how this game incentivizes not just hording cards ready to snipe cities that are almost completed via the event cards with the skull icon (along with some event cards that give you stuff for having more infected cities).

Unfortunately, the depth of this game besides some gauging of people's play style is very low, and while the event cards might change up what you do a little bit, most turns feel pretty samey.

RATING: 5.75

RATING: 5
You are a disease infecting cities in this game.  The game allows you to discard cards to advance on various tracks to help infect more, get more cards or mitigate WHO fighting the diseases.  As you infect cities, if you fill up a card the city is destroyed.  You get additional special abilities if the city is destroyed.  You also score if you have presence on cities that other players destroy.  

Its not a terrible game. I found it a little boring but some people at the table found it awful.  

I may not play again, but could be persuaded to play

[Played 1 time]

Banal and trite.
Area majority lead by coloured cards you draw and discard.
The "event card" (one is drawn at the beginning of each round) often leads everyone to do the same action (out of two) and the other was annoyingly obvious most of the times as well.

The "Pandemic" name is there just for marketing (the games have no similarities at all).

If one has to play area majority, playing it in a short timeframe (such as what this offers) is decently acceptable. This actually does it pretty well, using event cards for inter-game variety, a little tech tree to allow exploration of different play paths, and a means of killing off areas and changing the area landscape. And all over in a card-game type timeframe as you'd hope. It does have an issue of how much do you set up your LHP for points, but they still have to have the cards to take advantage of it. And it's short enough and cardy enough not to engender too much stress anyway. Decent decisions throughout, so I'd be happy to play again.

I will keep it around to play with them.

This is a quick area control game where you play different viruses that are trying to destroy cities. Honestly, the theme here doesn't really fit the mechanics, because it's really just a VP race. It seems like the best strategy is to spend the first few turns bumping stats so you can draw at least 3 cards and place 4 cubes and then kill cities in a single turn here and there when you can. There is also a deck of disaster effects that you are supposed to mitigate against by buffing a resistance stat that you then lose when you use it. It seems like a waste of time and cards to mitigate it, but it's situational.

Better than expected, but not particularly mind-blowing.   The "Pandemic" name is clearly added just for some branding clout, as this game has almost nothing to do with the co-op original. It's a set collection game with some leveling-up type mechanisms and some screwage.  
Kind of exactly the sort of game I'd buy for $10 from a friend who'd had enough of it but would be absolutely pissed if I'd paid retail, if that explains anything.
Oh, cool components, though.  Good job on the petri dishes.   Funny.

Nice light game.  The theme isn't so strong that the game is off putting (I mean, do you really want to be a virus that kills 10 million + people?) Still, you can make it work.  Indeed, the mutations and traits are appropriately themed for a virus.

Gameplay is a bit on the light side...it's a step down in complexity from Pandemic, but it also plays a lot faster because of that.  It's mainly a resource management and area control type game. It reminds me a lot of Smash Up actually.  Players place viruses on a location until a certain break-point is reached, and the top three players get victory points (death tally?).  It's important to be the head honcho occasionally, but also important to make sure you're sharing in the points at as many sites as possible.  Contributing the last virus will also score you an extra benefit, and sniping that benefit can really benefit you (and anger the guy who was hoping to get it before you!)

The event cards mostly help you, except the W.H.O. cards of which there are only three.  This is a little disappointing, as it reduces the tension in the game and reduces the importance of the resistance trait.  If there was more nasty stuff, you'd be more tempted to keep your resistance at a higher level.

That said, I've had fun playing (and pretending to be a virus). I've played with all ages down to 7 years old and the mechanics are easy to grasp, even if it might take A few games to grasp the strategy. Play it after you just recovered from a cold or stomach virus.  Hell, play it while you ARE infected to add a little spice to your game.

Edit: Downgraded to a 5...honestly, there's just not much to the strategy and the event deck is really just ho-hum. There's not enough variability in strategy with only three upgrades available, and of which only two (hand size and infection level) are a priority.

It is a quick game and fairly simple once you get the setup and play figured out. It is fun to be the virus and destroying cities, the manual isn't very good and the art and packaging are below that of other Z-Man games.

That said it is still a quick and fun game, my wife and I huge pandemic fans and this is a nice way to stay with in the theme and changes things up. I will say the 2 player playthrough was sub par... But, we made some tweaks and created are own two player variance that has been very successful and has made the game much more enjoyable. Will be posting that soon! 

Overall it's a fun game, probably prices a little high for what you get. I'd still recommend it to the pandemic fan look for spin off game. Non pandemic fans probably wouldn't enjoy this as much.

Okay, so we were really excited about this game, but there just really isn't much here.  And the theme just sucks because the goal is to kill as many people as you can....now, it isn't like it is shooter game or anything, so you don't really "feel" it, but still...it just annoys.  Plus the game isn't that good. They simplified too far. (JW)

A játékosok a vírusok bőrébe bújnak és városokat fertőznek meg. A vírusunknak három tulajdonsága van. A kártyahúzásunk számát tudjuk növelni, a fertőzésünk erejét, illetve az ellenálló képességünket tudjuk fejleszteni. Minden körben van egy esemény, ami negatívan hat mindenkire. A játék hihetetlen egyszerű, de nagyon sok múlik a húzott lapokon és még több az adott várost befejező fertőző víruson, illetve az eseménykártyákon. Szerencse szerencse hátán. Úgy éreztem ebben a játékban hiába játszok jól, semmit nem jelent. A királycsinálás magasan van jelen. Nem érzem változatosnak se, egyértelmű melyik két képességünket éri meg javítani a játék során.

Essentially, a simple area control game that has a Pandemic theme. I do like that there is an incentive to finish cities out, and the game does play quickly. Being able to increase the effectiveness of your actions does make for an interesting decision of whether or not to build up the strength of your virus or increase infections in the cities. Simplicity in this one does hold it back from a higher rating, however.

This time you play the bad guys, or microbes, viruses, smith, phlegm and blood of infections trying to kill major cities. Easy Are majority type game, with some varsity in the cities and the events. Nothing new put perfectly charming.

I like this although the third track (Resistance) is redundant. You can increase it by spending cards and when you use it you get to e.g. discard one fewer cards which is useless. The plastic translucent cubes are neat but the black ones are so colourless that people mistake them for other colours. I like the theme because I am into science.

You are the disease and you get points for infecting various cities throughout the world.  You get points for infecting cities.  Which ever player has more points in the end wins.

Unlike Pandemic, Pandemic: Contagion is a competitive game.  Two to five players can play, each playing a different disease.  You play cards to either infect a city or build up your diseases defences or strength.

This is a nice light strategy game.  It takes less than an hour to play with 4 players.

There's nothing wrong with Contagion, but it's an incredibly bland area control game with some semi random events to mix it up. Unfortunately, there are only 3 more event cards than are used in each game, so you'll have seen everything pretty quickly. Really forgettable.

RATING: 6
The rules lack clarity and detail which makes for an unnecessarily confusing learning experience. At it's core, this game should be pretty simple, but there were several elements that felt a little off and the rule book did little to rectify the situation. After only 1 play, I'm not sure about the game's lasting appeal, so my rating reflects my first impression only.

There appears to be multiple avenues to pursue with the different mutation types, death toll scoring, etc. By the end of the game, however, it was pretty clear that all of your choices in the game were not at all balanced. There is an almost sure-fire way to win, and the only thing that can mess you up is somebody else with the same strategy who has better luck. If you're going to give the player choices for their actions, they need to be equally feasible for bringing victory.

The Pandemic branding means nothing, other than its thematic element. This might seem lazy and/or sneaky, but I don't think it justifies knocking down rating for it. Don't go into this game thinking it is like Pandemic, because it's not. See it as a new game with similar themes, although a completely different play style.

Rating after one play at Essen. A very simple area control mechanic. Discard some cards, place your cubes, rinse and repeat. You can also "mutate" which means to increase the number of cards you can draw or the number of cubes you can place, and event cards mix the game a bit up, but it still feels pretty dry.

It's OK, but you have to be careful not to put your cubes into too many cities.  If other players don't help clear cities, you can be stuck with no cubes to play, which doesn't give you anything to do.  I'd rather play regular Pandemic.

I like it, I've played it a bunch, and somehow I can't seem to win very often. The game does get a bit boring pretty quickly, partly because of the limited number of cards available to random it up with and partly because you only have 3 different actions to choose from each turn. Generally your first 2 turns are consumed the same way each game, and players often race to kill cities, so the game rarely seems to last to the last card.

I have only played this game 2 players, but even with 2 this is a pretty fun game.  I like that it is regular pandemic in reverse, and I think its cool that increasing things you can do in the game is called mutating your disease.  Although, I still haven't found a benefit for the option where its basically a shield? I haven't ran into a scenario where I needed to use this.  Still, is a really good game and one that I enjoy.

I don't take labeling games broken very lightly.  I have had nearly a couple of hundred of games over the years and this is only the second game I would say is broken enough not to play.  Some games are unbalanced and can be unfair at times, but even those can be fun if you are up for a challenge or can easily be house ruled to rebalanced and are still fun.

But this game is so broken that there is no game left once you figure it out.  For us it was after the first game we realized how broken it was.  We spent 6-10 more games confirming and testing with some players testing various strategies and ultimately confirming that this game is broken.

I really liked the idea of this game and the time frame and size would have been perfect for me, but it is just too broken to fix.

I'll go over how it is broken below.  Stop reading if you want to enjoy this game to play the game up until the point where you hit this point.

Besides being strategically broken, this game suffers from other horrible game design deficiencies. 

First, this game has a high amount of success determined by who you sit next to.  That can work in some games, but in this game, it is painful.  You want to sit to the left of the new player.  You will be able to take advantage of their mistakes and leave nothing else for everyone else to cash in on.  In most games, when you make a mistake, it leaves more options for other players, but isn't that big of an advantage (or none at all).  In this game, it is the best way to score points.  So one of the most important parts of the game is deciding who to sit next to... sure sign of a broken game.

Next this game has a bad issue with king making (player C making a final play that determines if player A wins or player B wins, but never themselves).  King making is the most annoying thing ever in a game.  No one should be determining who wins other than themselves.  Maybe there is a slight advantage/disadvantage based on what is left open, but never ever ever ever ever a player actively making a move that gives points to one of two other players that decides which of them win.  The way cities are scored in this game results in that exactly (unless everyone is playing with the "broken" strategy, in which case, there is no interaction at all and really no fun).

So now to talk about the strategy that breaks the game even worse than what is already described above.  

************************** SPOILERS BELOW *************************

At first glance it appears that there are options at the start of the game as to strategy.  There aren't.  Cards are everything in this game.  You use cards to upgrade.  You use cards to infect cities.  You sometimes pay cards as a result of who cards.  Cards are key.  As such, increasing your incubation rate is the most important thing in the game.  So important in fact, that this is all you should do.  Everything else is pretty much a waste of time (unless someone leaves you a city you can cash out easily and get a good extra buff).  Otherwise, just stick to building up incubation first.

Next, increase infection rate.  Again, from time to time maybe cashing in a city that someone leaves open for you.  But focus overall on increasing infection rate.

Finally with these maxed out, you can start cashing in cities.  If someone plays cubes on a city and you can top them to take first place, do it.  Get the city and the bonus.  If you can't then you can take cards and go in cities by yourself.  We often would use two actions one turn to fill our hand, then use these cards to cash in cities for the next turn or two by ourselves (double infect the city).

You will be behind early in the game when people are putting out cubes and occasionally scoring, but you will be building your economy.  Then the second half of the game you will just come out and decimate scoring indiscriminately and leaving nothing for them to take.  If they do put anything out, you either go over them and cash it out, or leave them to have to pay to cash it out themselves if they go so far in you can't go over top.  At that point the game devolves to something very close to solitaire.  Everyone is pretty much cashing in their own cities and it is just a race to end the game with the most points.  

There is little to think about.  You just grind through the motions as mentioned above or lose.

I'd rate this game a 1, but a "1" says "defies game description".  I don't know if this game "defies" what is on the box.  I don't remember.  Does the box say it is fun?  Maybe it should be a "1"...

This is a decent filler if the theme of being a disease killing off major population centers doesn't turn you off.  Certainly some nice decisions between simply jockeying for majorities to score points periodically or just go all in to destroy cities for those points and special abilities.  My first game didn't exactly have a run-away leader... but by the final round it was not possible for the person making the final play to effect who would win and it seems like that might be fairly common which could be a turn-off.  All in all a good, light card game with control scoring if you like that sort of thing.

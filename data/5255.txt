TABLETOP MINIATURE WARGAME

Fun game to play in a campaign. One off games are ok, but game is more suited for campaigns. The problem is that the rules have a lot of grey areas, which can create a lot of arguments in play.

Necromunda with greenskins only. I bought it when I used to collect all the secondary GW games (when they still published secondary games), but never felt the urge to play.

Neat idea to build and customize your own orky vehicles then have them battle.  Failed miserably in it's execution.  This game is a stinker.

Skirmish game with space Orks on [i]Mad Max[i]-inspired vehicles. Not a bad game, but the minis came on small bases which did not keep them standing when on any kind of incline.

GorkaMorka is always a fun game, but the rules are so disorganized that it is sometimes difficult to remember how to do the basics.  I had to create my own reference sheets just to be able to play.

40K-ish orc gang wars.  High body count.  Only played a few times.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite tabletop games of all times.
It's just so wacky and unpredictable that you can sit back and enjoy the fun without planning ahead too much. Your plans won't survive anyway!

Good oldfashioned Ork vs. Ork crash-fest.

As a fan of orks and skirmish games I can not help but love this much derided game. There was something about driving around the desert in dangerous vehicles full of marooned, maniac orks that just never got old.

Orks + Mad Max = Gorkamorka. If you are not a huge fan of both, you probably won't enjoy it to the fullest. Everyone wanted to play Necromunda, I wanted to play this. They won.

Comedic and chaotic game that is a lot of fun but light on strategy. Then again if it was heavy on strategy it would be an insult to the theme.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Compared to GW's other small games like Blood Bowl or Necromunda, this one falls way short.  The relative lack of terrain, meant to make vehicle movement easier, just makes table set-ups boring.  The lack of playable factions (5 with the expansion) doesn't help.  I'll take Necromunda every time!

Played this a bit when it came out, never since... Although it seemed like a fine idea, it just wasnÂ´t that appealing to actually play. Saw it described somewhere as "Necromundas unpopular sibling" or something! I did spend a lot of time converting and painting my vehicles and orcs though...

Slapdash. GW attempting to create another necromunda-style game. It doesn't hold together.

Necromunda with vehicles. The rules can be used for vehicles in necromunda which is probably what you will use this for after you have played it two or three times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The lack of terrain and few vehicles per side makes this like Necromunda with all the interesting tactics removed. I think GW realised it was a stinker too, as it was only supported for about a year. That said, the junkyard feel to the game made it my favourite to do modelling for (something that I don't normally enjoy too much) because you could make pretty much anything you could think up; I fondly remember my brother's double-decker bus full of orks running everyone over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
My first tabletop game. As a Games Workshop Skirmish game, it's a great introduction for new tabletop players AND is great for fans of games like Final Fantasy Tactics, Ogre Tactics, Fallout Tactics (seeing a pattern here?)...

Also, this established my long-lived fascination with Orks/Orcs.

I like this one for some reason, it's too much hassle most of the time. It's not certain if it's a wargame or roleplaying ame but there is fun in there if you take it a bit lightly. Still as GW game, you might want to buy extra parts for it. Although the basic set had everything in it.

Fun. A skirmish miniature game that oozes fun. The rules support campaigns extremely well. There are a lot of options for modeling, converting and painting. Somehow the game really rewards gutsy, aggressive, no-holding-back attitude. Roll dice and watch stuff blow up. It's certainly not for everybody, but it's a very nice change from serious, strategic miniature wargaming.

Another GW classic. Some of the funniest rulebooks I have, More fun to read the books than play the game though. Still not bad game, and the few times this gets to hit the table, It certainly makes everyone happy. Quite a bit investment in time and work to play this one though, not sure if it is really worth it.

I hate the term ameritrash.

I would still call this the ameritrashiest of the ameritrash, if it wasn't british.

(Necromunda + Mad Max) x ORK! = Over the top cartoonish ultraviolent demolition derby.

Get in character, think like an ork and you'll be having too much fun to care about how broken and underplaytested some of the campaign rules are.

Suprised this game didn't last to long on the shelves because I really enjoyed it. Humorous, cool rules for moving vehicles and you get to uograde and expand your mobs as you play games. A must have for 40k players who like Orks.

Haven't played in several years, sadly, but I used to run two Mobs, one Gorker, one Morker.  

Amazing to me how a game so similar to Necromunda played out so differently just because it involved Orks.  I'd routinely take incredibly reckless actions that I would have never considered with my precious, fragile Necromundans.  Good times!

I really liked this game, being an Orc player in 40K and also in WHFB.  I was disappointed to see it drop off the game list so quickly.  Around here, if it isn't current, nobody will play it.  May consider trade if anybody is really trying to find it.  Fort is assembled but in great condition.  My son and I used this to introduce GW games to several of his freinds, but that was 10 years ago.

It's my first and last GW game. I spent years enjoying painting the miniatures and reading the magazine just because the background is richly detailed, just as the miniatures are, and it is plain fun to read and paint it all. But this first game was a BIG disappointment to me. To sum it up in one word: dice. There is an awful lot of dicethrowing, you roll to shoot, you roll for armour save, you roll to wound, you roll how serious a wound is, you roll to see if you run out of ammo, etc etc. But apart from the dicethrowing the gamesystem is very good and fun, the background is beautiful, and the miniatures are great! To bad dicethrowing means everything in this game.

I always thought that Games Workshop's space orcs were cool but unhinged.  You know what I mean if you've read the Waaagh the Orks sourcebook.  One of those games that I picked up because it was cheap but have never actually played!  It gets 5/10 just for the Orks content alone!  Maybe higher when I get around to playing it.

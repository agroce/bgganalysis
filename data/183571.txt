Very clever solo game where your dice are your crew trying to fight off a constant stream of internal and external threads. I love how all the ships use the crew differently. I love playing it with my grandson - we do it together. Now if I/we could only win once in a while.

Its hard to believe this game hasn't yet gotten the mainstream attention it deserves. Being born as a pnp first this small game packs the punch of a well thought out and designed game worthy of any design boardgame player's attention. Simple, quick, yet full of interesting decisions there's not much more one can ask for. As a bonus it has great replay value and that's not even factoring the 3 other ships the retail version comes with. 
Give the PnP a try, you'll quickly want more and more of this great system.

Tony Go makes some awesome games, and this solitaire dice game is no exception.

Deep Space D-6 feels like a tabletop version of the videogame FTL: Faster Than Light. It's simple, quick to set up, and it's fun.

I just finished putting together a print-and-play version in an Altoids tin, which means this game is crazy portable. The art/graphic design is minimalistic, retro, and great. This is my first attempt at making a print-and-play game, and I'm impressed with it!

I can't wait for the reprint of this game to ship later this year so that I can own a 'legit' physical copy. I'll probably bump my review up to a '10' once I have the manufactured game instead of my amateur print-and-play set. The poorly-cut edges on my card stock are not going to impress anybody.

I recommend trying out the print-and-play game, it's great! All you need to play: paper or card stock to print the game, seven dice, and two little cubes/things to use as health markers.

I played the mintified PnP version of the game
I loved the theme and immersion feel all game long !
I was hard-pressed all the time to make choices in order to get rid of the accumulating threats to my already damaged ship, and I almost could see my crew rushing all over the place to cope with all the tasks they were assigned to.
Mechanics are straight forward, graphisms on the abstract side (but very clean and thematic), game duration a little on the long side, difficulty seemed on the easy side at first... But I barely made it on the three last threats activation phases !
This one will remain in my go-to (and fit everywhere) solitary games list.

Kickstarter Edition

sleeved

Worker-placement-solo-sci-fi-FTL-like? I guess I have to try that.

First of all, the appearance:
The game-box with the sleeve and the magnetic lid is well produced and looks pretty cool. Only the graphic on the back isn't that clean...

Components:
The foldable ship-boards are pretty sturdy and high quality. The custom dice are really nice as well.
Only the cards could have used a better cardstock. I don't know if they last long enough without sleeves.

The gameplay is pretty simple. Roll dice, assign them, flip a card, roll another dice, gather your dice.
Maybe too simple...but it is fine. It doesn't want to be more than it is. It is just long enough that the repetetive gameplay doesn't bore you.
In fact it has the PERFECT length. After one round you immediately start another one.

My only criticism is the rulebook.
The rules could have been written more clearly. There are some points that aren't clear or that you find out during the first play(s).

Neat little solo filler game.

Quick fun solo game! Only playing the PnP version but looking forward to receiving my copy. I love the space theme and how our task is not to let the spaceship be destroyed. In a way that reminded me of Faster Than Light if you play video games on Steam. I can only assume the game will get even better when I have access to the other spaceships etc, as variety will help to keep it fun for even longer.

Now playing with the correct Oroborus rules I better understood the game and actually made it all the way to them before my ship exploded! I wish some of the cards had a bit more text on them to help with gameplay so I didn't have to go back to the rulebook or BGG. I need to remember to keep a pen next to me to add to the notes in the rulebook. I like how everything comes together as the decisions based on your dice roll can be tense and each die seems to be equally helpful. The game may feel a touch long but considering that included some rules references I would say the length is okay but I still prefer the Oniverse games which play just a touch faster than this.

Kickstarted.

An excellent solo game with minimalistic art and some clever attention to detail with the cards and box design. The multiple ships greatly enhances the replayability and the excellent worker-placement mechanic takes what could have been a slow ride and turns it into a frantic race against both the enemies attacking you and the clock. With rumors of a 1-4 variant in the works, I'll keep Tony Go on my watch list of quality game designers.

Backed the Kickstarter for the reprint, supposed to come in Dec. 2017.  I like solo games because often my kids aren't around to play so solo games give me a quick fix.  This one has good reviews, people seem to love it, so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I probably should have PnP'd before backing but maybe I'll do so now until my hard copy arrives.

A beautiful, classic-looking book sleeve holds this solitaire game. If you're looking to spend some time playing a strategic survival game, this is a unique way to do so. The artwork and components are high quality and simple, but artfully so. It feels very intentional and adds to the flavor. Here's the caveat - this game is all dice rolling. There are ways to mitigate your results but there will always be games where you roll threats every round and just get overwhelmed. Plus, going through the *whole* deck to survive can be tough. It can also get to a point where you're just waiting to roll the right thing to win with no way to lose. That said, the ships each offer a clever way to play and different abilities to face down the scoundrels of space.

Why this isn't a 10:
-> High randomness (variable mix of rewarding/frustrating)
-> Only so much solitaire game time

The designer did a good job publishing this mini fast game for such fine components, variety and low price. I own the Kickstarter edition. This solitaire game pits your space ship against external and internal foes which are represented by cards. Your crew consists of dice and your mission is to give them assignments within your space ship so as to take care of the threats. The rules are clear enough and in a few minutes you can jump into your first play. There are moments when things become dull and repetitive and other moments when things get tense, you have limited resources, limited options and an abundance of threats. Suddenly you  realize that your ship might be doomed. But this is not all; the game includes a variety of 4 space ships with different levels of armor or weapons. It is intriguing, balanced and fun.

Fun solo game that is rather reminiscent of Friday except with dice. Much like Friday, DSD6 is a puzzle that 'can' be solved and won easily providing that luck isn't piling the heavier threats on all at once. Once solved - the game becomes pretty easy (again, like Friday). I finished all 3 difficulty levels of the Halycon ship in 5 plays, and I had a blast doing so - thankfully the game does come with 3 other ships that hopefully require a different strategy to beat! 

Replayability might be a problem once you've solved all the ships however :\ 

I have all previous games from the designer, Tony Go, and you could definitely see the progression in his designing experience - this is easily his best work yet. 

Strategy Tips for Halycon:
-Stasis beam is your friend
-Recalling dice from scanners to help manage threats is a powerful strategy
-Ouroboros is much more manageable if it comes out with a scan, where you can still spend dice, rather than at the threat phase where your dice are spent.

Not sure if I got a bad batch of dice or what, but the dice I received with my game were horribly produced.

They are all slightly different in size, and their corners are all non-uniform. so they essentially are differently shaped and lopsided, with some being non-cubic basically.

This is somewhat inexcusable in a game totally dependent on dice rolling and using dice as the game pieces to boot.

Game itself is OK and good for SciFi fans, but I enjoy some consim solo games more.

Quick set-up and play time, great box art and graphic design. Some ambiguities for the end boss ship, but he was added during the Kickstarter and wasn't really tested apparently. This is essentially a game of treading water. You try to outlive the deck of cards, so there's no real arc or anything. It's a nice distraction, though.

Also, great value and components considering the price.

I'm the game's designer. Deep Space D-6 is a self-contained, imaginative 1-player game designed as an homage to RPGs and gamebooks. 

It looks like quite a few BGGers are rating the PnP and not the retail version. Much of the feedback from the PnP has been addressed in the final game. Replayability is hard to accomplish in solitaire games because they can be played over and over again with much less obstacle than your average competitive game. I had a playtester tell me he got bored of Deep Space D-6. Then I asked how many times he played. He logged 60 games in just a few weeks! It's easy to get burned out on a game this small, but if you keep things in perspective, I think you'll find it very rewarding. 

My secret desire for this game is for some child to find it and give it a shot. Get better through repeated plays and spark an interest in science fiction media and the possibilities it represents. I can trace back the books, movies and fiction that I consumed to shape me into the science-loving, future following person that I am today. Decades from now, an astronaut floats in orbit around Mars. She thinks back to that little white box she used to go on adventures with. Deep Space Dice was it...

Fun solo game with nice components for the small size. Creative box/theme. Would/could give 8.5, but some cards are not intuitive and the rulebook does not explain how some of the cards work (e.g. meteoroid, nebula and Ouroboros). Hopefully the designer or BGG volunteer will create description of each card and upload the file!

FILLER SOLO
Another amazing solitaire PnP game available to us for free thanks to BGG. I printed out the card deck on thin card then sleeved them in bigger sleeves with a coloured back to make them easier to handle and shuffle. Worked a treat. Edit: have recently bought a manufactured copy - delighted with it. And backed the KS.

Print and play version.

For anyone considering crafting this, it's a fairly easy build. Cards are just a little more than poker sized, but sleeve OK in poker sized sleeves with a playing card behind for support. The trickiest part is crafting the dice, I printed them at 80% on a4 label paper, cut out and stuck them to 13mm dice ghouled from an old set of "Boggle" dice and they seem to be ok, although I expect they will wear with repeated plays.

It's a simple game with very interesting mechanics, but the game itself is not that good. One of the issue is that you have little control on the results of the dice, so little dice manipulation compared to other express dice game. The only choice you have is which ability you are going to use with that dice.

In early game I had nothing to do, even some dice face like engineering could never be used for most of the game because there was no hull damage. Also, there is twice more external threat than internal threat, and they can only be destroyed with weapons, or disabled with science. Which means that the only thing you really want to roll is weapons. Internal Threat has more variety of requirements, but I ended up having really few in my game.

Finally, the scanning dice locking is a bit weird, why does scanning lock dice and make threat appear, would it not be the opposite, put people on scanning to avoid drawing a card.

Difficulty is excessively variable due to the amount of randomness in the game. I ended up having a threat appeared and disappeared on the same turn. Or having threat that never got triggered.

So great mechanics ideas that could be reused elsewhere, but not really a game that I would be willing to play often due to the lack of control and decisions that can be made.

RATING: 5
On paper this seemed like a not too shabby dice placement game. Instead, you will often find many die faces to be completely useless, especially if you have the threats under control.  It is also can be quite swingy of things going perfectly fine to panic mode, although as this is solo and isn't a super long game that only bothers me a little bit, and besides that is expected of a game so dependent on dice. The biggest problem I had with this game though was for about 2/3 of it, it felt like the game basically played itself. Sure, the other 1/3 I had to prioritize if I wanted to unlock dice vs. dealing damage or what not, but that 2/3 you can easily calculate what die actions are best. By that I mean for the 2's  4's it is very easy to calculate which threat has the greatest expected damage and focus fire on that first/if it is worth it to boost shields or stun, 3's a lot of the time you won't have dice both in the infirmary and locked in threat so there is no choice, 5's and 6's literally have no choice. Also for the 1's often you will not have to worry about one of the things that the other die results combat, (e.g. no enemies to damage, shields are already at full, etc.) so choices there also don't seem that difficult. The choices for what to do with each number perhaps could have been made more difficult with deciding whether to finish inner threats or perform the normal die actions, but I feel like half of the inner threats are so powerful that to me I always just prioritize them anyways. Keep in mind I generally am not a fan of dice placement games, but I was hoping for something with more interesting decisions.

RATING: 7.8
My experience is that the first ship (Halcyon) feels too easy, and thus a little lack-luster. The Athena and the Mononoaware however provide the tension I was missing, and the game starts to come alive. Still haven't won with either, using three of the six Don't Panic cards. I still have yet to play with the AG-8. The Ouraboros cards seem completely off whack and insanely hard to the point of being seemingly impossible to win against. I don't play with them, although I look forward to the 'tweaked' version of them that I recently backed on Kickstarter. The presentation is great. The box art is one of the things that initially attracted me to the game.

Addendum: One small negative for me is that there don't seem to be definitive rules as to what to do in the case of a couple of the cards. When browsing the forums it seems the designer has kindly chipped in, but offered replies along the lines of "I left it purposefully open-ended. Please decide for yourself. What makes the game more fun for you is the right choice". Fair enough. I personally like a game to proudly declare how it plays and it not be left to the player to decide, but I fully appreciate that some might prefer the sand-boxy approach more. For me, it makes me feel like the designer didn't really know what to do in a couple of cases and so he kind of hedged his bets.

P&P version. Kind of like ghost stories lite with its onslaught of enemies. That's a good thing as the former is punishingly stressful. This is an easy to manage, quick die game with a bit of push your luck, the theme works well and it is easy to imagine each die assignment in the flesh (commander sends an engineer to the gun room/ stasis beam activated/charge shields before the meteor hits/pandemic sends people to the infirmary). Does not have the overrun mechanism that makes GS overwhelming. Fun

This review is for the Print and Play version. I have got a kickstarter copy, I am just waiting for delivery. 
The game is really good, it feels very much like FTL the computer game in tabletop format. 
I really enjoyed the mechanic of this and at times a few of my games felt like when I play Pandemic, and everything seems to be going well and I am chipping away at the threat deck, and then all of a sudden, it goes horrible wrong. I find my shield failed in a nebula, corsairs strafing my hull and a crew of medics wondering what happened to the rest of the crew. 
Really fun and worth a go. If you go for the Print and Play, then do consider buying a retail copy if you enjoy it as it looks to be an even better version from all the updates I have received.

Print and play Game, small footprint solo game with a space theme. Gameplay which involves using six dice as crew members, which can be assigned to areas of your ship  by priority as you require them.
Some dice can be locked or removed from play and placed in areas such as the infirmary making them unavailable until future rolls.
Lovely design, light and very quick. Main objective is to work your way through the threat deck of cards which contains external enemy ships or internal threats such as aliens. Which attack your ship and reduced your shields and damage your ship.
Very well designed game which is available on BGG. Created by Tony Go.
Definitely worth printing. Can be transported in a very small box. Can be upgraded with homemade player content. Kids have just started playing this and the signs are very promising.

A neat concept that isn't quite well enough executed to be fun.  Too much of the game is boring with nothing to do and all threats being instantly squashed, interspersed with occasional overwhelmingly bad draws that leave you with no hope.  Rarely are you in a tense situation with real decisions.

Also, the rules are simple but spread over 3 different places.
 (1) the rulebook and its back cover (good!)
 (2) the back of the ship board you are currently using and have pieces all over (terrible!)
 (3) the inside cover of the game box (bizarre!)
It makes a very simple ruleset annoying to look up and get right.

One playable ship sometimes gives you rerolls.  Otherwise, you pretty much use what you have.  That one ship does rerolls like Pandemic: the Cure, which is great -- you get unlimited rerolls but you cannot reroll the 1/6 bad result.  That mechanic should have been put into the game as a core rule, and balanced accordingly.  It would have injected choices into every turn, instead of mindlessly rolling dice and doing what they say.

Nice production value, and nice dice.

Meh - ok time killer but it basically plays itself with choices pretty obvious. The threats are pretty bland, so it doesn't create the immersive narrative I was hoping for.

I would always prefer to play something like d6 shooters or Roll through the Ages solo.

Whilst it has a strong risk of becoming too repetitive, there is some good scaling (variant ships, adjustable difficulty) to mean that it will survive more than a few plays.  And it's certainly no cake-walk even on the "easy" versions.
I could carp about card inconsistencies etc. but they would be nit-picks rather than serious complaints.  As a whole, the package is great fun and definitely recommended.

I managed to pick this up just before the reprint KS, and really happy to get it on my table. 
The four ships in the box make sure there is plenty of replay ability due to their contrasting abilities.
The order of card reveals can also produce a different feel in each game, although it is not immediately evident.
There are some neat fan variants, although I haven't had the opportunity to go further than printing them out.

I am really looking forward to the RPG lite supplement (The Long Way Home) and mini expansion (Rescue Mission), although there is already a lot of game in this small box.

A fair interesting solo worker placement game with dice. I've only played a few times, and never managed to get particularly close to actually winning a game. It is well designed, and the PnP files were quite good. My main issue is that I just really don't care for a solo board game, unless it is particularly meaty (like Viticulture or Robinson Crusoe). If I want a short little time killing solo activity I am much more inclined to play a game on my phone or kill time that way.

I PnP'ed this and am glad I did. I am not seeking out the full blown box set but if I found it I would be tempted. A good fast little resource allocation game. Plenty of challenge. Not difficult to learn or play but hard enough to win you stay engaged.

RATING: 2
If you roll a couple of 6s and have dice sent to the infirmary and don't roll a medic, game over early. Likewise if you get a couple of big threats that connect on the first or second turn of the game. Pointless exercise in flailing away at randomness.

Quite fun actually. My first PnP game. While I'm glad that I didn't "spend money" on it, that doesn't mean I won't play it a ton. We'll see  how it holds up in the long run.

I am really enjoying the unexpected strategy in this game as what you choose to do with the dice you roll changes significantly depending on which ship you are playing with. I have won most of the time but usually  by the barest margin on the easiest difficulty.

The starting ship is way too easy and basically runs on autopilot, but the other three ships reveal this as an excellent solo dice-chucker, full of danger and tough decisions.

Solid dice allocation game in a portable, low-footprint package. Difficulty is a bit random -- some games will be too easy or too hard. The minimalist graphics work well in this context and the "Choose Your Own Adventure" style game box is charming. The choice of ships, which all play very differently, keeps it from becoming stale too fast. Hopefully the upcoming expansion will up the replay value even more.

Played it and lost but I had a lot of fun playing it. It's a pretty tense game and you feel relieved when a "Don't Panic" card gets drawn. Will certainly play it more. Even thinking about to make a Deluxe version PnP of it.

Kickstarter edition: The components are really nice; the dice, cards and ship boards are comparable in quality to those found in much larger games and I love the box! The game has a super quick setup and there are lots of decisions to make throughout; it can get quite exciting when you're coasting along, thinking you've got it won, then two turns later you're overwhelmed! This has a real old school charm about it and was an absolute steal for the price. So glad I backed and thank you Tony for going the extra mile on quality, it really makes a difference.

It's a nice, simple game where I don't need to burn many brain cells playing it.  Roll the dice, respond to things on the board, keep going til I win or die.

It's nice that there are 4 ships to switch up gameplay, but I have to wonder about the staying power.  Right now I'm really liking it, though.

PnP Edition: Missed the Kickstarter support window. :(
I've played through the print-and-play version many times, and I absolutely love this game. It's an ideal solitaire game for kids or adults that like a little sci-fi. The components are simple, the rules are simple, but there's plenty of choices to make and lots of replayability. It has plenty of room for expansion as well. I love that the designer included just enough theme to give it flavor and keep it elegant. Although I don't agree with some of the design decisions, and a few of the threat cards are confusing (to me), it's very well thought-out and balanced. Definitely a keeper!

Update: My 9-yr old son has played it and loves it. Won on his first try. 

Update: I received the full retail version as a Secret Santa gift, and, after unboxing and making a custom insert, decided to trade it. For some reason, the "mintified" version is still my favorite to play. There's something about the smaller version and the purity of the original ship that appeals to me more than the full version.

Survived 4 ship attacks. Was down to 2 hull. Narrowly escaping death. THEN I drew the Solar Winds card. Game over. I was listening to the Faster Than Light soundtrack while playing and having a blast. Played again and beat the thing. Fantastic little game.

Wonderful game. The mechanics are simple but give the player much variations in terms of possible actions, leading to different consequences. It really shows that the designer has put a lot of time and effort into creating it. For such a short game it's really remarkable how diverse it could feel from play to play. The theme is implemented very good too. Every single threat feels logical in terms of how it attacks, or otherwise hinders the player, and what she needs to do in order to defeat it.

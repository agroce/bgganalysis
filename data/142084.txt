The only problem is that the font for the verses is too small... Otherwise the cards are easy to read, the artwork is great the theme is well thought out, and the game play is challenging and fun!
I think the golden calf idols (meedols? midols? ) are really cute and the the theme tie ins are clever and entertaining - e.g. i think it's the "prophets persecuted" card that makes you all run up the mountains and stay there

There are very few games that can pull off a Bible theme well, and this one is pretty good. I thought it would feel like a pandemic clone at first, but it is quite different once you start delving in. There are similarities, sure, but not enough to worry about. Good game to play with some of my friends from church who would be put off by some other themes.

What a great game!  I was skeptical considering the similarities to Pandemic.  But the "prophetic" cards and false prophet really added to the theme.  Clearly alot of time and planning went into this game.  Really like it!

Very challenging, yet engaging cooperative game.  I really appreciate this game for incorporating a challenging theme into solid gameplay.  If you've ever played the digital version on Steam, you have the option of answering Bible study questions each round to gain bonus cards.  This is a fantastic idea and would be relatively easy to do with the physical version. I've played both now and look forward to more opportunities to play with friends.

An interesting direction to take the Pandemic type of cooperative game. My appreciation for the setting of a game is increasing; this game has a great setting. I like how this game does not add sin cubes after every turn, unlike how Pandemic adds disease cubes after every player's turn, because it allows the game to have a better pace. Other than a few ambiguities in the rules, the game seems great.

Suffers from a lot of the same problems as Pandemic, but its end condition is drastically improved. Rather than being basically another timer that players must force the components into place, players have to spend the valuable time they could spend fighting off sin in order to draw resources.
It seems like the difficulty of game may be hugely dependent upon the strength of the Sin & Punishment and Blessing cards drawn.

Game also does not seem to scale terribly well. The game gets significantly harder as more players are added to the game: 4-player is incredibly difficult in comparison to 3 or 2 (though is likely the most fun because of it). I recommend playing 2-player games with both playing as 2 prophets.

(9 plays)
First Impressions: 3

Rule interpretation: Resources cannot be discussed directly, but players can identify their capabilities (i.e., 2 out of 3 building resources, can\cannot perform sacrifice)

I really hate it when people clone ideas from others. Just fo that, the rating is dropped by 2.

Cloning Pandemic also cloned its weaknesses. I don't see why I should play this game with other players, there is no point. It is a solo game. And like Pandemic, the game decides where you go, you can't really do what you want like most of the coop games.

Next time you clone something, I suggest you clone only the strengths, not the weaknesses too.

KoI takes familiar elements of Pandemic and adds interesting spins. It adds prophetic cards that don't take effect until future turns. It has both positive and negative structures that the players have to create/tear down, and resources that can be used in multiple ways.

Pandemic with theme of prophets. Game was not bad and events are interesting, but on other side it was not blast to play and there are other coop games we would rather play than this one. 

Also it is good to have it localized. If you are not native one can see that you will have problem to understand words from Holy Bible which are written on cards and create big part of narrative of game.

Good game with solid theme.  No doubt it feels like Pandemic, but the pacing is better, the theme is better, the play is smoother, and the play time is shorter.

Huge disappointment! I had such high hopes for this game based on the buzz. Perhaps it could even be a Pandemic killer? No. It's not epic like Pandemic, there's almost no tension, and your choices are not interesting (they're too obvious). As a result this is a flop. I do like the art and the "theme," but that's not near enough to warrant placement on my shelf.

Fun game. Basically Bible Pandemic, so nothing new or terribly innovative.

Topic is fun and easy to get into as long as you read the Old Testament passages in as metal a way as possible while playing the game.

Also fun to imagine that as the "good guys" you are going around stoning people for committing sins like eating bacon and working on Saturday, or doing otherwise reasonable things that we wouldnt have a problem with in this day and age.

Not a bad game, considering the theme is almost a complete turn-off for me. I've seen some compare it to Pandemic, but I think it has an interesting level of resource management and event cards that give it a different flavor. I'm content owning the digital version of this, but I wouldn't be against playing the physical version.

Now if they re-themed it to a cult spreading its influence a la Lovecraft...oh, wait...

Rahdo was right - this is not just a Pandemic clone. KoI borrows the best elements from Pandemic's threat management system, but feels quite different. I love the way the resource cards work, providing for more a interesting range of player actions. And the way the Timeline of Kings determines whether players draw a Blessings card, or a Sin & Punishment card gives the game a real sense of historic flow, and ties the gameplay experience to the biblical narrative. Very good game. I'm looking forward to teaching this on to my friends.

I've never played [b]Pandemic[/b], but if it's anywhere near as good as [b]KoI[/b] then I guess I should. I'm really liking this game. It's well crafted and easily accessible, though by no means easy to win. There's a good amount of systemic randomness built in (a plus for me), but it's manageable (only just). The playing time is relatively short (another plus for me these days), but if you have the time you can get in several plays in a session. And you may very well want to. The components are high quality, and the theme never gets in the way of the experience. Very interested to see what Funhill Games comes up with next.

This game really gets a bad rap because I secretly hate co-op games. That being said, this game is really another variant of Pandemic. There are some things I like better about it. The theme is great for me and the in between round manipulation is quick. However, after playing Pandemic and Commissioned, and me not really liking co-ops in the first place, there is no room on my shelf for this one. If you do like co-ops though, this really is a solid variant of Pandemic with a historic theme. Give it a try.

Co-op game with Judeo-Christian theme. 

I really like this one. It is a 'threat management' game like Pandemic or Flash Point. 

The 5-6 player expansion rules introduce "villains" - the False Prophet and Thief. I doubt I will ever play it this way, though.  The game is tough to beat.

I play this in a combo of easy mode and expert mode.  Easy: resource cards faceup, and get a Blessing when you make a Sacrifice.  Expert: the False Prophet.

This game is so much fun. At first blush, it is a new take on Pandemic, but the random abilities, the inclusion of foretold events, and the influence from foreign nations makes this a much more interesting game. There are many more choices to make and many more unique challenges to deal with so that if feels less like a puzzle and more like an organic, unfolding story. Great game with lots of replay value.

Pandemic with biblical theme. Smooth with nice build up in tension. While it's nice to see an actual, good, solid religious themed game with mechanics that work - it's also very derivative of other coop games, so offers nothing new. However, if you really like coops, need another example, or are looking specifically for a good, religious themed game, this one will work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really nice co-op game where players are trying to eliminate sin and destroy false idols while building altars to God throughout Israel. The game has positive and negative event cards that are determined by the nations current King. Sin continues to spread every round and the apostles must build enough altars before the destruction of Israel comes to fruition. Albeit much easier, the game has a similar feel to Freedom the Underground Railroad. A lot of fun to play and very family friendly.

This is a game that will change your perception of what a Bibllically themed game can be.  It's mechanically sound, it plays smoothly, and it's not preachy at all.  

No doubt it will be compared to Pandemic, but the idol mechanism, foretold event cards, and having to spend actions in order to draw resource cards make the game feel different.  There may be only one "disease" (sin) on the board, but it's relentless and can be very difficult to stop...especially once you introduce the theif and/or false prophet!

It's a Bibllical game done right and it will be in my collection for a long, long time.

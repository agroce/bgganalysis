THE game of 2013...

RATING: 9
A game that appeals to my tastes. Complex, many things to do but with uncertain pay-offs, lots of indirect interaction and strong on theme.  The production values are high, but the rulebook is challenging to learn the game, but once this is overcome, the rich options provide a great gaming experience if you like more involved games.

05.12.2015:

Zwischenstand/Endstand nach 3/5 Runden:

D: 29/91, J: 20/101, Syndikat: 17/55

Mit Minierweiterung 2 = 5 neue Grubenunglücksmarker.



gespielt nach der 2-SP-Regel des Autors. Da dabei das Syndikat auch aktive Spielanteile hat und an der Einnahmewertung der Zechen und an der Spielplanwertung teilhat, können im ersten Spiel nach dieser Regel leicht Fehler auftreten, weil das so doch recht ungewohnt ist. Wir haben in den ersten drei Runden die Spielplanwertungspunkte des Syndikats nicht gezählt, so dass dieses einige Punkte mehr hätte haben müssen. Geändert hätte das aber am Ergebnis nichts. Das Spiel war spannend bis zum Schluss. 

Eine Regelunklarheit gab es: Die Schlusswertungspunkte für Eisenbahnlinien sind in der Mehrspielregel nach Spielerzahl gestaffelt. Für 2 Spieler ist das nicht geregelt. Wir haben die Bewertung dafür vor Spielbeginn festgelegt: Braune Linie 3 statt 4, rote Linie 6 statt 8 und gelbe Linie 2 statt 8 Punkte im Vergleich mit der 3-SP-Wertung. Dabei muss man sehen, dass die rote Linie einen Bahnhof kürzer ist, die braune Linie ist vollständig, die gelbe ist aber nur mit 2 Bahnhöfen vertreten, die auch noch durch zwei Bahnhöfe voneinander getrennt sind, die nicht im Spiel sind.

Die Wertung der Einnahmen des Syndikats von den Zechen in der Weise, dass dieses statt Geld je 2 Münzen 1 Punkt bekommt, funktioniert gut.

The rulebook is a mess and with faults. I wasn't expecting too much after the too scenariodriven game Ruhrschifffahrt, but this game is a lot better than the previous "Kohle" game of Spitzer. Here the decissions are difficult and important because there aren't that much actions in the whole game. The consolidations are not easy to understand at the start, but after a while the game becomes clear. Not a game you play with family, but a real gamer's game.

RATING: 8
First Play: A long and trippy rule book to digest and understand. The translation from German hasn't been smooth not including the mistakes (4 coins starting money then 5) and the ambiguous statements that have needed too many clarifications. However it is 5 times more straight forward then Ruhrschifffahrt, its predecessor. 

It took me a day to prepare to explain the rules and another hour+ to actually explain them. It took too long for me to appreciate the nuances of the strategies and there are quite a few. The game slowed when the big mines took over on turn 3 and throughout when players needed to check the mine cards to see what the income and costs were. it would help if these were on the board.

The game was pretty tight up until the end when final consolidations and scoring took place, then it strung the pack out but first and second were settled by a point. 

A very deep and strategic game that saw a spread of points in the 5 five who played. I'd love to play again but am put off by the idea of explaining the game all over again to new comers.

Interesting action selection game (you only have 10 actions!!!).  The rulebook is pretty terrible, but once you get going, everything kind of makes sense.  Tons of interesting choices, but so far, in the 3p game (all I have played), the "area control" aspect didn't feel tight enough.  Looking forward to another play, as I made a few brutal mistakes that I would like to get back.

I was hoping (and expecting) to like this one a lot more than I did.  While the game has some interesting ideas, it just felt a little overburdened with fiddliness and rulesiness for my tastes.  Some of the fiddliness results from the graphic presentation, which could have done more to help; you end up having to do a lot of somewhat unnecessary cross-referencing between the board and tiles, when more of the info could have also been included on the board (especially mine costs).

We were also excited to enter the part of the game where the mining consolidations happen, but that part of the game also felt a bit fiddly, slow, and plodding, and the bidding wasn't as interesting as was hoped.

I likely would have rated this game a 6 had the effort expended to just play the game hadn't been so hindered by the rule book.  I don't know about the German rules (maybe they are good), but the English rules are confusing at many points, and in some cases, just fail to really explain things.  It took several reads of the rule book and a read through the BGG rule forums before things became clear.  It is slightly better than the Ruhrschiffart rules, as I just ended up putting that one back on the shelf after trying to figure it out.  However, these rules were still a challenge, which is a rarity for our group, as we typically just whip a game out, read the rules, and play, which is definitely not possible here.  It's rather odd, as the game doesn't end up being all that complex, and everything is rather straight forward once you start playing.

It is not all negative, however.  Our game saw players taking completely different strategies all finishing rather close to each other, which was nice to see.  I also enjoyed the catastrophe stage, where players can both control how susceptible they are to danger, while also controlling the likelihood of the coalition being strong or weak in the game (the strength of the coalition will determine how difficult it is to beat the game itself in consolidations; a strong coalition means it will be expensive, while a weak coalition makes things cheaper).

Overall, a pretty neat design, but I'm just not sure I enjoyed playing it, unfortunately.  As I said, this was somewhat amplified by how much effort I had to expend just to figure out how to play the game, but I'm just not sure I'm really interested in playing again.  It's a game I might play with a group that really wanted to play the game, though.

RATING: 4.5
Face down train tiles are inexcusable.  Play them face up.  Disasters are a silly tax. 

Should probably lose another half to a full point from its current 4.5 rating for the low levels of interaction, but there's a wafty charm to the game to make up for it.

Graphical production is a mess and mostly a sign of the missing development.  The only things the player boards are needed for is to hold mines.  Everything else should be or already is recorded on the central board.  

Hugely and grossly in need of additional development.  The designer was simply let down and betrayed by the publisher for the lack of development applied to this potentially interesting game.

Otherwise innocuous and vaguely pleasant.  May have 3 plays in it.  Possibly the best non-18xx/non-Winsome game of the year with its rating of 4.5 -- though it would be nice if that were saying something a bit better than "this is tolerable mediocre".

Solid sequel to "Where's Your Fart?" or whatever the real name is. Unnecessarily difficult to learn. The unofficial rules rewrite was also difficult. Rather difficult to rate, because while the design seems solid, I didn't super enjoy my first play, and yet I can't quite clearly articulate why, despite being heavily biased to enjoy it, after spending a small fortune to import it.

I count myself lucky to have been able to play Ruhrschifffahrt and this title in quick succession. The games are hard to come by, and explaining and playing them requires some careful agenda scheduling.

K&K is, I think, the strategically better of the two. It is more open ended as in how you proceed compared to the ... scripted? back and forth of its predecessor where people seem to end up with the same things in the end because specialisation is difficult to achieve. This comes as no surprise as the actions of K&K are much more diverse than the generic coal hauling of Ruhrschifffahrt, which is basically all you do. Unfortunately, where gameplay is concerned K&K does not win out, in my opinion. K&K suffers like its predecessor from an unwieldy art design which obscures important information, and although the pauses and interruptions it causes are small in themselves, they do add up. There are also some minor errors to be found of which one is genuinely confusing. You have five options to pick for your actions, but with between 12 and 15 actions to take, and numerous options requiring others to have been carried out first, you're not as free as you might imagine. Still, play becomes ponderous because every action needs to count. There are a few 'mini mechanisms' which feel tacked on in order to get the balance correct—or perhaps to justify some thematic idea, who knows. I simply find them a distraction.

The game itself is pretty thoroughly explained in the [i]German[/i] rulebook, although there are some finer points which may crop up but are not likely to affect the actual game all that much in your first skirmishes. But you must read the rulebook in full and remember that some rules have been pulled apart. It is in there, but some mental reorganisation is required from time to time. Players buy mines in a single larger area, get income and points for these for a few turns, upon they are forcibly consolidated to a less interesting large mine, which remains with a single player until the end of the game. Mines need workers of course, so these are first plucked / traded out of the neighbouring villages until empty, after which you need to build houses there so you have a 'focal point' of sorts through which your own workers enter the board. From there these can also occupy train stations for points. Apart from the pithead cards and little details like protecting your mines from Bad Things, this is what K&K is about.

I have to admit that K&K seems more about 'doing stuff in the Ruhr area' rather than 'creating interesting game patterns'. [i]The[/i] main question is whether you will focus on a few well-equipped mines so the consolidation works in your favour; or whether you want to spread out in order to maximise the VP revenue for as long as it lasts... for once consolidated, the VPs no longer roll in (as much). For a game lasting as long K&K does, this foundation is pretty rickety. It is also for that reason that I do not plan on playing this game much in the future: for the time it takes I can easily put out a title which [i]does[/i] ask interesting questions and has the players pitted more against each other than in a little priority race and some specialisation.

[b][FirstImpression/PlayOn4April2014][/b] Get to play this at a local game store. This game was high on my buylist and when I found a copy, I really wanted to get it. Then opportunity to play it came and so I immediately jumped on it to play it first before purchasing a copy. 

The game was ok, a pretty easy game for me and I can see that explaining the game may be slightly difficult. It seems to be the kind of game to be best played with 4-5 players.

Components wise, they're all of good quality. The artwork is like any other standard euros. 

I enjoyed playing it but I don't see the point of me buying it since I don't think I can bring this to the table that often. It feels good to finally play one of the mining series from Spileworxx.

Looking forward for the third one in the trilogy.

Here's a game I find it hard to rate after a single play.  Dry and economic for sure.  Unforgiving definitely.  Strategic rather than tactical?  Most certainly.  Similar to other games on the market?  Not directly no.  It feels suitably different from anything out there.  Though the experience is rather like playing Brass or Age of Industry in that there is little tactical play, and following an evolving strategy is the way to play the game.  Also it isn't a game you can simply go with the flow as you really need to understand what is going on from the very start.   I prefer last years Ruhrschifffahrt which was more intuitive, more tactical, and it had a lovely feel to the game as you shipped coal along canals.  Here we are dry, brutal and PDC (Pretty Damn Complicated), not necessarily  a bad thing but certainly something to bear in mind.  It needs 5 players to work well in a competitive way.  And I hope that I never have the job of having to explain the rules.

I am convinced there is a good game in Kohle & Kolonie. It is, however, hiding under a lot of cruft and most of it feels like a distinct lack of development. A bit of polish might have restrained the administration overhead, gotten rid of the sprawling mess of player boards and fixed the iconography that sometimes uses the same symbols for opposite meanings.

As it is, the game puts a high tax on new players, and while it flows reasonably well once all the small niggles have been internalized I do believe most of them could simply have been disposed of with a bit of effort. I do agree, however, that Kohle & Kolonie is certainly a step up from its predecessor Ruhrschifffahrt and feels a lot less railroaded.

Complex heavy euro.  Lots of interlocking mechanisms that I still need a few more games to untangle as I've only played once.  Interesting mix of mechanisms with resource managment, worker placement, area control and auction leading the list.  My gut at this point is that it is a good game, but for it's length and the challenge the length provides for my limited long game play opportunities, there are many other games I'd rather play.

Opinion: enjoyable bidding game, yes, I say bidding because the main thing in the game are the mergers, how you prepare for them and how you finish them. There are other ways and many other things to do during the game, but you must understand how the mergers work.
Although the rulebook is a mess and there are so many things going on, you get the idea soon (but not earlier enough to be ready on your first game).
5 turns with 10 phases, being some of them a kind of bookkeeping and others repeated. Bring mines into play, buy them, run your rails, build settlements, improve your company, be ready for disasters...
Regarding the latest, do not see them as something random, only 5 disasters and always the same, moreover you can be safe from them if you want (and can)

Two combined goals: mines and railways. Only 10 actions per player in the game (3 additional actions are possible). But the most limiting factor is the number of miners. You can send them in mines, use them as guards, send them to railway stations or in your surface industries. Be careful with them.

(**第一回合隨便一位開始選額外行動版塊)由順位軌最後面的玩家到額外標記軌拿對應標記(選完把個人標記放到該空格上。)，全選完把順位標記移上去，剩下的額外版塊左推，>當之後有人用掉額外版塊就馬上放到最左邊，額外標記當輪沒用完就放回
*獎勵標記: a.礦坑救災(保護兩座礦坑不受礦災) b.併購金援(拿取一元或併購時增加競標金額2元) c.貨車(計算礦口卡多一個礦車，不需支付勞工) d.定居地(可以兩元建設定居地，可以放0~2個礦工)e.購買蒸汽引擎(只需一元)
***實色看向左邊的是自己顏色礦工，淺色看向右邊的是灰色勞工(中立)

Like my experience with Terra Mystica, this felt like an exercise in brain-melting complexity for its own sake, rather than an engaging game that requires the complexity to work.

In particular, I thought the mine disaster mechanic contributed nothing to the game - with different draws the top 3 contenders in a 5p game could have won, and the 2nd place player bought no mine insurance the whole game.

Also, the consolidation auctions, which should have been the centerpiece of the game, felt like an afterthought - only one consolidation in our game had any competitive bidding at all, and that was just a matter of the guy who wasn't going to get it bleeding the guy who was.

Juego de gestión de recursos que mezcla por un lado mecánicas de subasta con gestión de trabajadores y rutas.

Se trata de gestionar una serie de minas que van colocándose en un tablero central. Una vez adquiridas por los jugadores son explotadas para producir puntos y dinero que invertiremos en comprar mejoras para las minas y nuevas minas.

A partir de determinado punto las minas de tamaño pequeño se agrupan en una mina de tamaño grande mediante subasta.

Quizás pueda pecar de rejugabilidad, pero claro, tampoco es algo que vayas a darle todos los meses

Fantastic complex game with a lot of great mechanics within a very deep thema and lots of options and strategies. The thing I like the most, is that you seek proximity at first and need to "fight" it later.

It appears alot is going on, but it's a bit of smoke and mirrors. Still, wrapping your head around a strategy is challenging -- the limited actions available do focus things, however.  It's not a "fun" game though -- but few euros of this weight are.  Still, it doesn't seem like it runs long for as much as is going on.  Happy to play again.  But not tempted to buy.

What is it with Spielworxx that their rules are a behemoth to master and explain? Actual gameplay of Kohle & Kolonie is not as daunting and complex once started. Thematically and gameplay-wise it's most comparable to Brass although it's not as deep or variable and even a bit fiddlier. Main offender is the clunky consolidation phase.
It's a game firmly rooted within the trend of heavy strategy games becoming more convoluted each year. The benefit is a well-integrated theme at the cost of gratuitous chrome and a lengthy rules explanation. Challenging enough for fans of economic Eurogames but falls short of being a great game.

Two plays, and I decided I should go ahead and grab this one while it is still available.

Finally played this again.  It was tough to get back into the swing of things.  But once the game was over, I felt more comfortable with how to play.  Looking forward to playing more of this - hopefully soon - to cement my grasp of this somewhat intricate game.

The theme is great, and I like a lot of what the game models.  Right in my target zone of what makes a game interesting.

I hoped that this would be an 8. but it is less than halve the game I had hoped for.

first of all. don't play the game without checking the faq's thread.

there are plenty of errors in the rules and luckily we houseruled most of them  according the rules. so our play was pretty much correct.

worker pool is a biggy. get that straight.
extra action; you can only play them if you have that token.

If you leave out all the confusion from the rules and the icons used what remaims is a game where you have thirteen actions at most. the rest is scoring and consilidation.

the game should after repeated plays take around 60 minutes + 15 minutes of fiddling with the mines. there should be a player board for the game as well to hold the mines :)
or even better the value of the companies should be on the board.
the player board is unnecessary big and should have been a little more compliant with the rules.

I really think it is a mess.

I think the art is fine. the map is okay and pretty clear. allthough i probably would have listed the actions there instead in the board.
why does everybody have to flip the same token on their personal board. It could as well be on the actual gameboard.

furthermore, having thirteen actions at most means you have to play three settlements, three engineers and flip a certain tile. meaning you have 6 free actions to choose from.
i would be fine with the game if it took  30 minutes to play instead of 75. because there just is not a lot you can do.

It is one of these games where you just want to do more than you can. And sometimes that is a good thing. not here.

Infact I might play this again next week to see If my first impression holds up. I think I have to because one of my most anticipated games for Essen was arkwright but now it is off my wishlist.

FIRST IMPRESSION: 

Worst set of English rules in the history of gaming bar none.  I'm fairly certain some of the Japanese games I've owned with creative English translation was easier to understand than this convoluted mess.  Once the game gets running it is fairly straightforward in how it all works together but getting started is hellish.  If Spielworxx wants to be put out English editions, they NEED to find someone who writes fluent English and understands how to write rules.  

Game itself is also quite fiddly with tons of moving parts.  There were times I felt this to be a mishmash of mechanics of which some could easily have been streamlined or eliminated to little ill effect.  

However, despite all of the above, I did find the game engaging and interesting.  With only 10 actions in the whole game outside of bonus actions and whatever bonus tiles you may choose, one has to have a plan and implement it well.  

I do want to play again - time will tell if this one stays in the collection for that long.

RATING: 8
First play:

Seems very thematic, low on luck, with a reasonable level of interaction. Lots of things going on, so be prepared for a rather lengthy first rules explanation, the reward however is a very rich game on the coal mining history of the Ruhr.

Second play:

Confirms my opinion, however you have to actively seek interaction in order to get it, i.e. you have to take mines in the same spot as other players in order to be able to bid against them.

Long term impression:

The disaster phase needs to be houseruled IMO. For a heavy economic game that long, having a random mechanism like this just doesn't cut it.

Solid & deep Euro. Lots of interesting mechanics. A bit busy. First play was long and rough.

After one play seems best as 5-player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
A worthy follow up to Ruhrshifffahrt, though quite a bit heavier.

The game takes place over five rounds with players struggling to establish mines and improve their operation.  In turns 3-5, there is an additional consolidation whereby several smaller mines become one big one, though the big mine can only be controlled by ne player, so anyone else who owned a small mine which got consolidated loses out.

The one major reservation I have, and the reason this did not get a higher rating from me, is the rule book.  It's very, very poorly written.  It is impossible to understand how to play the game with a single read.

I spent hours reading and re-reading the rulebook until things became somewhat clear.  Unfortunately, many things are not just disorganized, they are absent.  Players will be left to intuit and assume certain rules.

While I find this unacceptable, there are enough really good things going on with Kohle und Kolonie that I can overlook this glaring deficiency and enjoy the game.

Wow, a lot of stuff in the box, more than I expected.  Wow, the rules took more than an hour to go through but the game ended up being rather good.  Played in a couple hours and basically fifteen actions or so, but quite a few choices in those actions.  I like how the purchasing of an upgrade by one player affects all the others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Economic game about purchasing and running mines in Germany. Players have a limited number of actions (10 in total throughout the game) and resources to purchase pits in mines, run wagons, develop rail, create settlements, improve mines, improve consolidation power and guard mines from disasters. Additionally on rounds 3-5 mines begin to consolidate. These consolidations take the form of auctions and the winner gets the entire mine and any steam engines associated with them. There's also a non-player, the Coal Trust, that purchases mine pits and competes in the consolidation bids. 

Overall, a super competitive game that's actually fairly straight-forward once you gain an understanding of the rules. The rulebook rewrites and errata are essential.

The game was explained to me so I didn't have to pass through the rules, which i keep seeing that are awful. But the re-written rules are better...so they say.

The game has a lot of things going on, to me the best part is the Consolidation phase, the twist of the merge of the mines gives you long time strategy thinking.

There is certainly room for this game in my collection and the rating will go up for sure.

Kohle & Kolonie is a deep economic game based on building up the mining industry in the Ruhr valley.  Everyone needs to buy mines, but from there there's a ton of different options that players can take, from ramping up your money production to loading wagons to setting yourself up to win mine consolidation auctions down the line.  The game features a handful of "pithead" player boards that players can place cubes on to get bonuses every turn, each of which can be upgraded for a cost to make those bonuses even better.  This really helps players specialize.  Additionally, there is a "coal trust" game-controlled player that makes sure the game keeps progressing and that everyone has competition.  All of this is put together nicely in a deep, rich game.

The rulebook is apparently a mess, but I had the luck that someone who had played it 3 times before, could explain the rules. 

And in fact it seemed not that hard to explain the rules, as there are only 5 different sort of actions you can chose from and there are 10 phases in a round, but most of them are quite straightforward, only the merging of mines requires some explanation. 

However, this is the kind of game where it's very hard to do well with only 15 actions (and possibly some bonus actions at a cost of 4 VP). You have to make up a plan and stick by it. 

To be short: this is the kind of strategy-game I like: squize the maximum out of a minimum of actions :D

RATING: 9
Right off the bat, the rulebook as written is unusable. Some of the unofficial rulebooks posted to bgg are helpful, but they are each flawed in their own way. This game takes a lot of patience to get started. Once it does, it runs smoothly and beautifully.

In essence, on the board, there are these mine spots. Each spot has a bunch of different mines. The mine tiles become available in different rounds and you can buy them and they produce money for you each turn. On some rounds, the spot collapses into one mine tile, that everyone involved in the mine can bid on
in addition to that, every round every mine on the board scores you points for each player you share a location with plus one for each house that you own bordering it. Houses always border a few different mines, so if you build sensibly and work on getting enough money to win actions, you can do really well.

It's that delightful thing where you want to share spots with people, but not tooo much and then there are a lot of other rules in terms of how you max your efficiency and pick up bonuses.

I feel like for future plays I need to write myself notes about how to explain this game, so that I don't have to stumble through rulebooks again.

Will probably never play again. Theme is very well done and realy fits every aspect of the game. It is not very thight with three players, think game comes to it's best with 5p. Game lacks tension, cause there are to many ways to score points. If you can not go one way , you just go the other. Disasters are not "punishing" enough. Better is extra punish for not being able to use the mine in the remainder of the round and your miner is dead, for being not safe. But then the next problem, the trust becomes too weak, cause only black counters come out of the bag. Game needed more playtesting to become more punishing. I think this is a very light euro game, allthough i know some will disagree.

Second game from Spitzer covering Coal Mining in Germany.  It does appear that Spielworxx (and Spitzer) have learned from their experience with Ruhrschifffahrt and the English rules are more easily understood (though not without their problems).  The game does seem a bit easier to internalize than RSFahrt but still has a variety of methods by which to accumulate points.

While the game can be played with 3P, the removal of Essen isn't enough.  This game is really designed for 4P and 5P, not so much for the competition on the board for mines, but for the turn order / action chit bidding process and managing tempo of actions in relation to available resources on the board.  With 4P and 5P playing on the same board with the same resources, the game will award efficiency more quickly in a 5P game.

Players purchase mines in mining regions ringed by villages. While the mines operate independently, players score points based on total activity in the region, but eventually they will be consolidated -- a merger process that ends in a single, larger mine owned by either a player or by the game's Coal Trust. Points are also scored by establishing settlements on village spaces, by collecting mine cart symbols (and in a few other ways). 

The most interesting feature of K&K, by far, is the mine consolidation. Not only is it a major source of points, there are interesting incentives around board play (e.g., such as the fact that exhausting workers limits mine purchases to players with settlements in the region) and thematic wrinkles, such as the behaviour of the Coal Trust: the more mine disasters there are, the greater the political will to clean up the industry and the harder it will be to outbid the Trust.

The problem is the interesting parts are buried in layers of cruft: free actions, extra actions, bonus actions, engineers, steam engines, a clearly bolted-on railway token mechanism, disaster and disaster prevention rules that make no sense, inconsistent use of mine cart iconography on the Loading card, etc. It's not the game is complex, it's that so much of K&K's complexity feels unnecessary and obscuring.

We laugh at Brass for its special treatment of the Birkenhead link, but those rules are thematic and explained in historical terms. There is no justification here for, say, the sliding of mines on the tableau (nor leaving disaster recovery miners behind once their mines pack up and leave).

There is also little excuse for the unnecessary randomness, such as the face down train tiles or randomly gifting some players with steam engines through consolidation.

RATING: 8
US copies of this game shipped without a rulebook (inexcusable). Poor game development and bad rules translation. There is minor component (tile) errata, too.

Quite a struggle to learn, even with the unofficial rules rewrite. There's no clear course of what to do when first playing the game, so expect frequent stumbles and numerous rule look-ups. 

The iconography is somewhat confusing at first, and each participant has no less than 6 player boards (a tableau and 5 pitheads). This makes the game sprawling, but also quite daunting in its appearance and feel.

I very much do like the overall look and theme, plus there's excellent replayability too. One quibble is that mine disasters seem too weak.

It took three of us to struggle through a full session, but once everything came together we enjoyed the game a lot. Great gameplay with rich options that has a Wallace-esque feel to it (which is a good thing). K&K is one of those rare titles that I think about often, even when away from the table.

A half-point deducted for poor rules/development, otherwise this is one terrific design.

RATING: 9
Strategically complex economic game centred around coal production in 19th Century Germany. The main premise is to purchase coal mines and to develop pit-heads that bestow benefits with the aim of acquiring victory points. Each turn more mines become available for purchase and if players can gain presence in larger mines alongside other miners, the more points they will amass. Eventually entire mines come up for sale and players with a presence bid against one another to gain control of it. 'Kohle & Kolonie' is an extremely complex and multi-layered game to play from a strategic perspective, although the gameplay is relatively straightforward, and is a natural progression from a game like 'Brass', a game it shares a lot of commonality with in terms of its objectives. For people who can stomach heavier Euros, 'K&K' is highly recommended.

Last year's [thing=130390][/thing] was a game I wanted to love, but I could only like. It just wasn't all that fun. It's follow up certainly comes from the same place. A similar theme, similar weight, similar feel. But this one is more fun to play. And that is the reason I'm glad I got this game this year (I count gaming years as starting with Essen) and not his game from last year.
I guess I don't have to say that the artwork is nice and the components are of the quality you can expect from a game printed in Germany.
It's not cheap, there certainly are better or more fun games you can find at a lower price point, but that doesn't mean this game is redundant. I think it deserves some attention.

In the hands of a good developer this could have been an excellent 90 minute game rather than a 3+ hour behemoth.   There's too many parts that feel unnecessary or that should have been approached differently - this applies not only to the mechanics but also the components and presentation. It's a shame, cause there's some interesting ideas here, but the depth of the game just isn't commensurate with its length (and fiddlyness).

Probably prefer Ruhrschifffarht, but this is still superb. Love how the progression works, and how the mines merge.

An interesting game.  Might be too difficult to teach to get too many plays.

Probably a good game for those who like these kind of games, but not my cup of tea and no fun for me.

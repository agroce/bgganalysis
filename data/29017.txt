Frantic game where you have to perform certain actions, some of the dexterity kind, in realtime. Kids like it, but they don't ask for it. The youngest have gotten a lot of use out of it as a toy though. Many pretty beads and some nice building blocks in there.

RATING: 7.5
A very amusing little game - great for kids and adults alike.  I enjoy the many various 'tasks' one has to complete - this added with the 'push your luck' element, makes it a delight that will not grow old quickly.

Rated for my 5 y.o. daughter.  Very nice game for kids - a little dexterity, a bit of memory, a bit of press your luck - all tied to a bit of speed.  Draw a gem from the bag and from this determine how many tasks you must perform before time runs out on a hidden timer.  Complete the task(s) and either try for another or say "stop!" in order to keep the points you've just earned.  If the sand timer runs out before you say "stop!", you lose all points you just gained for that round.
Very enjoyable game with the kids - also easy to handicap (kids can play with the timer in view while it's hidden for adults, and/or allow the kids to play more rounds than the adults so they have more opportunity to score).
I liked this one much better than I thought I would after reading through the rules, but after 12 plays, I'm starting to tire of it.  The kids still love it, though.

The activities involved are fairly repetitive but still ok fun.  Matching the colours to the mask really gives me the shits, though, because in the bag all the colours look the same to me, and my hand is too big to fit in easily.

Crazy party game. For me even too crazy. And require some space to play.
I prefer something that fits on the table, don't need special soundtrack to play etc. It's just take too much trouble to play so simple game. imho.

Great kids game. Both simple and challenging, and easy to handicap for different ages (double the time, hidden time or not, ignoring the throw-and-catch card which weirdly seems difficult for some kids under pressure, etc.). Sort of a collection of mini-games, but it works!

I rate children's games according to how excited I am about playing them with the appropriate aged child.

I bought this game not realizing it is almost identical to a game I already own (Treasure, Ready, Go!, AKA Auf die Schätze, fertig, los!), and like a lot better.

Jungle Treasure is one of the best new-to-me children’s games I’ve played in a while. It’s a great, fun way to teach children (and adults) to perform tasks under pressure, especially when played by the rule that states that the active player can’t see the timer while it’s running out. The 5 different actions that each player may need to do on their turn keep things interesting including some Jungle Speed reach-for-the-totem, throw-a-bead-in-the-air-and-catch-it, memory, and tower-building mechanics. It will be hard for young kids to beat their parents, but parents can have fun playing it on their own too if in the mood for some light dexterous fun.

Definitely oriented more toward kids, though I have enjoyed playing this with teenagers.  The size of the jewel bag is the first indication of this - you're supposed to be racing the sand timer, and I found it difficult to keep putting my hand  in the bag!

The game is a grab-bag of mechanisms, most of them reminiscent of Fraga's other games (especially Squad Seven, Cosmic Attack or Eiertanz) in that different tasks will be required, you never know which.  Some are ridiculously easy (tossing a gem up in the air and catching it - though one must remember that this is for kids), the memory task as well as the gem matching task can actually be kind of hard.  Also, another nice thing is that you cannot see the sand timer, but must judge how much time is left on your own (reminiscent of Fraga's Time Is Money).  There is a huge amount of luck in the card draws, as those determine the amount of points you earn, but with such a light (and quick) game, who really cares?

Given the choice, with adults I would bring out Fraga's other games.  But I'll definitely be using Jungle Treasure as an intro for kids into the world of Roberto Fraga!

Nice and fun dexterity game for ages 6-16? Easy to teach, fast paced and quite short.

For older gamers:
-> Luck is too important, not only for the missions, but for the number of white pearls you get; thus far, luck have been the decisive factor in more than 50% of the games I have played
-> The solution they found to reduce downtime (the all-play game where you have to catch the explorer) is weak; downtime is not a lot, because there's only 4 players and the turns are fast, but it's still there.
-> This all-play game where everybody rush to grab the explorer is dangerous for the fingers.
-> The bag is not easily accesible: those with big hands will suffer

Even if it doesn't bring anything new to the table, I'm sure it's a very good game for those who like dexterity games (which I don't).

A super fun, fast, and intensely timed treasure hunting game. This game is very similar to Treasure Ready Go! We happen to own both games. What makes Jungle Treasure so intense is the hidden timer. You will want to search further for more treasure, but you won't be sure how much time is remaining. You see...your opponent hides the timer and keeps watch and you must finish your tasks before it runs out! 

In Treasure Ready Go the timer is visible and you seem to have lots of time to collect lots of treasure. In Jungle Treasure you have a faster timer...I think...and it's hidden...and due to the difficulty of the drawing of the gems you cannot collect as much treasure as the other game allows! So you see, they are both unique in game play and we like them both!

RATING: 4
A decent kid’s game if they're good enough to handle time pressure. You get a random number of card turns and you must execute as many special actions as possible before the timer runs out, be they build something out of wood pieces, toss a stone, grab a tile quick or find the right coloured stones. It can be fun if you’re willing to want it to be.

RATING: 7
Multi-task speed game in which in turn a player has 30 secs? to draw gems from a bag, which dictates how many task cards to do (from 0-2). Tasks involve building a block sculpture, tossing and catching a gem or grabbing a large explorer meeple/jungle token (the latter task means other players can grab out of turn so not much spectating). Each task successfully performed earns vps, but the real decision lies in pushing your luck within the time frame to keep pulling a gem to perform one or two more tasks before the sand runs out otherwise return all vps earned in that turn back.

Good family fun especially in helping young hands learn to build and catch.

This rating is for adults.

Silly ten minute filler not to be taken seriously. The tasks are more difficult than they appear (but most people approach this game as a silly kids game and totally underestimate the awesomeness of this game).

The game is surprisingly a bit klunky on first play; Because of the time pressure, players tend to "cheat" by forgetting to draw a gem before taking a card or not flipping tiles back face-down during the memory task.

With kids this is my one of my top games of choice. We modify the rules a bit so that the timer can be seen and smaller kids get two runs through. There's a real sense of excitement racing the timer and the fact that all players are in with a chance to make points on any player's turn means there's no downtime. It's interesting to see how six year olds can really get stumped on the one point catch a gem task. Three year olds only start to understand the 3D building concept after a lot of patient explaining. Lots of bits in the box makes this game great value. Highly recommended for playing with kids as young as three.

--------------

Players are constantly performing simple tasks under time pressure, like building blocks in the same way as depicted on a card, or finding a certain face down tile they may have seen earlier in the game.

Because the tasks are relatively easy, children have a sense of accomplishment. The time pressure component makes it easy to even the playing field between different ages and skills - give younger children three turns of the sand timer.

I suggest initially modifying the rules so that not completing tasks in time doesn't lose a player their points gained on the turn. The pulling out of the zero action gems from the bag is penalty enough.

At the end of each turn players will have achieved something, but with a feeling that next time they want to achieve more. Whether on their turn or not all players are engaged (little bonus points grabs are available for those concentrating).

You can buy either the English or German version - the game is language independent and comes with English and German rules.

This is as rated by my 7-year old son.  After playing it (and he plays a ton of games...) he stated, "That is the best game EVER, daddy!" and wanted to play it again and again.  Being the doting father and gamer that I am, of course I did!

A great mix of hidden information (timer) with push-your-luck, hand-eye co-ordination with mechanical skill (building temples), and memory.

While, as an adult, I'd probably rate the game around a 7 or so - choosing to play it with non-gamers or mixed crowd for a light intro - I have to agree with my son's rating based on the gleam in his eyes and the grin on his face while playing this fun little game.

RATING: 6
This game is really a mish-mash of concepts seen in quite a few other games -- kind of like a children's Euro version of Cranium.  You have stacking similar to Make 'n' Break.  Totem grabbing ala Jungle Speed.  As well as minimal memory, dexterity, and matching components.  While I could see this being a somewhat pleasant play for kids, it really doesn't work all that well for (sober) adults.  The big problem is that the rewards for the tasks are really not all that balanced.  Perhaps for kids they are, but for (sober) adults they are not.  Even given that, it is a pleasant enough filler type game for early or late in the evening if you are not taking it seriously at all. [07/05/2008]

Really fun little kid's game.  The challenges are fun and when the timer is hidden, trying to estimate the length of time that you have left adds to some fun tension.  It makes for a fun light filler to warm things up at the start of the night as much as it is good kid's entertainment.

Fantastic kids game that has several different elements -- fine motor skills(stacking blocks in patterns), dexterity (throwing a gem in the air and catching it with the same hand) and press your luck (do I go for one more gem and call it quits now?). The sand timer really puts some pressure on the players and it's fun trying to get just one more gem. My 6 year old loves the game and I enjoy playing it with him, so I couldn't ask for anything more. Very nice bits too. Pretty good filler when played with adults too as it gets everybody's blood pumping.

Good game to play with kids, but needs quite a few tweaks to be enjoyable with adults.  This is entirely possible, and would be a great time, but the rules for the kids game make the game very very easy for most adults (to the point where there is not much of a game there at all).

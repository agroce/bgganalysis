This will either go off incredibly well, or horribly. Depends on the group. When people ask what game I'd recommend to get younger people to play games, like late college or after going to the pub, this is it. The silent variant is neat and helps if you have to play it somewhere in public. It's the 21st Century form of Pit fwiw. Oddly enough, it's a great game to play after breakfast to wake up with before something meaty for game day.

Great, silly fun! If you want a sure way to generate some smiles, laughter, and energy this is a game you must own. Kids love it. Adults love it.

I can confess I am a sucker for this kind of games, so I guess I probably enjoyed more than the average gamer. But I enjoyed the frenzy, the people shouting and moving about, the tention and the speed of this game. The artwork is quite cute (although to be honest, you completely forget about the artwork as soon as you start the game..no time for appreciation).

RATING: 8
If I rated games based solely on how well they accomplish what they set out to do, then Happy Salmon would have to be a perfect 10. This fast-paced crazy party game is such a blast that you can't just play it once. I absolutely loved it and taught it to my friend who instantly bought a copy for the youth group as well. The rules literally take about 2 minutes to explain, and everyone is ready to play instantly. You probably have to play with a group that isn't stuffy and uptight, you need people just looking for a good time. It's a great one to bring to family gatherings or other places where you'll be around a lot of non-gamers. The only downside I see to the game is just that it only handles up to 6 people, and it feels like a game you could play with at least 10. It's also worth mentioning that, while the game can be quite loud and distracting if you were to play it in a game group where others are trying to play other things, there is a silent mode that is just as much fun.

RATING: 7.5
A fun quick party game, happy salmon has you trying to be the first to get rid of your deck by flipping the top card and trying to find someone else who has the same action to take and performing it with them to get rid of the card. This happens in real time, so players are shouting and pointing and trying to get their card matched. The actions are happy salmon (slapping forearms), switcheroo (switch place at the table), high five, and pound it (fist bump). 

Works well with kids and adults, and also includes a silent variant for those who need to keep it quiet.

Lustige Idee, mit der richtigen Runde rasch zwischendurch gespielt. Auch sehr gut geeignet, um ein bisschen Schwung in eine Gruppe zu bringen - schon aufgrund der Bewegung, die man macht sind nachher alle wieder fit für weitere Spielrunden. Geeignet ist das Spiel für fast jedes Alter - Kinder haben genauso Spaß wie Teenager und Erwachsene. Taktische Spieltiefe sucht man hier natürlich vergebens - das ist aber auch nicht das Ziel.

Excellent physical party game that brings the laughs and joy. The only problem with the game is that it's the type that will wear out its welcome pretty quick.

After playing this game at a Memorial Day BBQ, this game's a keeper. The cards are sturdy, and color-coded for easy separation.

The kids had a lot of fun, and the adults joined in. I purposely didn't discard some cards so that the other kids would be able to ditch more cards - I think the mad scrambling around, and the four-year-old yelling "swichawoo!" was worth its weight in gold.

Many think this is a kids game, and when I teach it to adults I can see the skepticism in their eyes, which inevitably rolls away with the sheer joy and delight they can't keep in whilst giving each other high fives, pound its, and of course good old fashioned happy salmons. Adults become kids again as they race around the table for a switcharoo and race to be the first to get read of all their cards. Takes 2 minutes or less to play and I and my kids love it.

I am not the biggest fan of party games, but sometimes you just need a game that you can teach in 30 seconds and is a good ice breaker. This is that game. Sure it's about as heavy as a helium-filled balloon, but games are over before I could take all the components out of other game boxes. As long as you're playing with people who are mobile enough to switch standing spots around a table, this is about as perfect as an ice-breaker game can be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For it's genre (very fast, very silly, party game), it's great.  

We broke it out, the kids (4 and 7) figured it out fast.  Their favorite is the happy salmon slap.  

Wish it came with a few more card sets.  It maxes out a 6 players (and technically, you could figure out teams if you wanted).  I think I'd prefer a set of 10 to create a truly crazy group game.

Ridiculous - but it's 30 seconds to teach, less than a minute to play, and gets the blood moving. Seems like a fantastic icebreaker.

We bought this based on a gaming store suggestion.  After reading the instruction, we immediately started thinking of children in our life to which we could give the game.  On a whim, Jeff decided we should play it once and what resulted was hilarity and much more fun that we imagined.  We've decided to keep it.  

This is by no means a strategy game for serious game nights.  But, along the lines of CAH, it is a fun social activity for the right crowd, but in a clean sort of way.

North Star party game, with simple rules, short play time (2 minutes), and high on fun.  It's reminiscent of Pit but is a simpler party game that requires people to be doing fun activities together when they get a match.  The Silent variant is also very fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great ice-breaker!  A great buzz, silly and instant.

In comparison with Pit: 
* H.S. is much faster to set up, or to modify when a player joins
* H.S. only plays to 6.  With 2 copies you could play up to 12, but that's £30!  Pit plays to 8 for a tenth of that cost.
* H.S. can't be played with people sitting down.  
* H.S. needs a table (or, say, a hula hoop on the ground - just something to run around), and some place to put your done cards (or you could reverse the cards and put them at the back of your hand).
* they both have a silent mode which works well.

Fans of Happy Salmon (as a kids' game) should check out "Dancing Eggs", too, though H.S. is much more comfortable for adults to play.

This is a great icebreaker game if you have the space, ability, and inclination for players to run around the table.  Space can indeed be an issue, and it doesn't work with people who aren't able to run around due to age, disability, or laziness. 

The frantic pace of trying to find another player who also needs a high-five in real time reminds me of the trading phase in Pit. Still, there is something more satisfying about sharing a fist bump than simply trading a card. 

I'd be happy to play this from time to time, but I often would rather not cavort about the table when I'm in the mood for a game. Despite a degree of skill and real competition, this game is really more of an activity. It's a good alternative to Twister.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (July 2016)

I had never heard of Happy Salmon until we played it. Happy Salmon is a fun and silly party game that plays in under 5 minutes and can be explained under 1 minute. When you play it, you will probably play it many times in a row. It works as a crowd gatherer.

The game components are robust (and that’s very important because the cards suffer a lot during gameplay) and my SO loved the salmon shaped bag :D. The art is ok.

I like it more when players are screaming. When played silently the game is less fun for me, but still a blast!

Best with 6 players.

Bottom line, I should love Happy Salmon and I have had lots of fun when I play it, however, my desire to play it again is rather low and I can´t bear to see how the components suffer, so I won’t buy it. It is a great game for the family though.

I like Happy Salmon.  It's a really great ice breaker game, a lot of fun early in a game night or at a party with non-gamers.  It's fun, it's loud, with lots of laughs.  The game just isn't a great replay game.  It's fun every time you play with new people, but if everyone has already played it loses its luster quickly.     Fun game for what it does well.

RATING: 5.5
I like Pit, a lot.  I could not help but compare this game to Pit, given some similarities.  Given the choice I would always play Pit.  Maybe it's the physicality of this game, maybe it's the appearance.  I interact and laugh more with Pit, a game equally chaotic, but easier for me to accept, and with the element of surprise and deviousness that comes from the bear "hot potato" cards, something that often evokes laughter and emotions.  I find all of this missing from happy salmon, and I don't enjoy as much the appearance/playstyle.

Happy Salmon is a game I'd written off as pure gimmick. It will get old quickly I thought. I was wrong. It's a riotous laugh that does what few games manage to - gets people out of their seats and moving around - often frantically! Not for everyone but definitely for some!

Not for 2 players. 3 could play but 5 or 6 is best. Very fast rounds (under 2 minutes). I prefer to play with the hand gestures rather than speaking.

For what it is, a simple, fast and silly pick up game, it is pretty near perfection.  It isn't some epic game, and it doesn't pretend to be.  VERY easy to teach and for people to pick up.  Small enough to keep in my bag to pull out at impromptu moments, and so far has been a hit every time.   The most popular has been the silent version. It is hilarious and always has multiple plays in one session.  
Side note: switcheroo has been changed to switching cards for my plays.  Adults seem more enthusiastic about it, and makes the game playable sitting down.
highly recommend!!

My score is based on the fact that, I personally, am not so into speed-based, high-energy, social games like this. With that said, I think this is a really great game, specifically for kids but also anyone who likes these sorts of games. The kids we played with seemed to really like it; though I would add one caveat: children who can't yet read might have a harder time because while each card has pictures, they aren't as distinguishable as the words.

RATING: 6
Yes it is a Pit version for kids both being mood lifters, but suffers from the Catan problem in that a player close to winning (visibly so because of cards held) can be embargoed by others, so prefer Pit with closed holdings or players keep their Salmon cards close to their chests.

One of my best game purchases ever, and I'm not kidding. A simple game of "rid your hand of 12 cards" where you have to find someone around the table who shares that card. If you do, you perform the action on the card (give them a high five, fist bump, change places with them, or do this funny "happy salmon" move where you slap each other's inner arms with your palms like two fish mating). It's loud, boisterous, a lot of fun, and it always draws a crowd. Then people cycle in and out of the game for a while, and eventually a totally different table of 6 is playing than who began the game.

Happy Salmon is a goofy party game, but bite-sized and interactive enough that the light-hearted, if a bit silly, subject matter is of little detriment. It -is- fun, and that is a prime quality for a game such as this. The play lasts all of 2 minutes, acting as an energizer and potentially raising spirits while being good for a laugh. The game aspect itself is thin, but the concept is somewhat ingenious. 

(+) Very accessible (Even works for ASL speakers, which is rather clever!)
(+) Playtime hits a sweet spot of brevity
(+) Highly interactive

(-) Subject matter can be deemed juvenile by Serious Gamers.

RATING: 7
When played correctly, it's hilarious chaos in real time with everyone involved.

However, it suffers because the rules are sometimes hard for younger kids to remember in the middle of a real time game, and it's hard to be monitoring them in real time.  Some kids forget what an action icon means (if you cannot read) which makes them feel left out.  Some kids confuse cycling a card with discarding a card, resulting in inadvertent cheating.  Once you play a few games with them, this drops away, but it's a barrier at first and with any new kids you teach it to.

It's still fun with kids and supports a range of ages all at once without much issue.  However, it falls short of sheer brilliance with

Real talk, this is barely even a game - but as a silly fast-paced activity, which is what it is setting out to be, it is a success. You will laugh, you will switch places, you will throw cards on the floor, you will exchange the "happy salmon". My wife loves this game and requests it specifically.

This one is very fun in a party setting. You really need to play the silent variant (in my opinion) for the game to show its brilliance and downright hilarity. Wiggling your hand back and forth like an idiot and then slapping your friend's forearm three times is satisfyingly hilarious. This one is just so much fun. It's nothing serious and may not have too much longevity, but it's really situationally excellent.

Speed game of giving and reading signals from other players. You have to get rid of 12 cards (3 of the same types) which you can do by performing an associated action with another player having the same card (on top of their stack). 

There are two modes:
- the screaming one (think "pit")
- the silent mime one

With kids the silent version worked really neat as they need to focus on other players around them and react to them quickly. (Loud version made the kids too excited to focus well). It's one of those "caffeine substitute" games (to wake everyone up), plus if you want players to notice one another, this one does the trick.

Has dethroned "Spoons" as the most raucous party game I've ever played.  No thinking at all involved (our favorite thinking game with raucous fun is still "Time's Up") but this quality of Happy Salmon makes it great for all ages and gaming inclinations.

Good silly fun, especially to get the family or a few kids together to get out some energy. By having you try and identify someone else, it gets everyone involved with each other and since you're all just racing in realtime to get done, it's chaotic and full of energy.

Do you own Happy Salmon? You should own Happy Salmon. A fast, silly game that plays up to six and takes a minute or so per round. Even comes with a carabiner, so it lives attached to my Quiver.

This game is a frantic experience. Games last 5 min at the most and everyone is yelling the whole time. Excellent ice breaker. Not going to last an entire game night, but a great one to fill the need for certain social gatherings.

A great game to play with kids, or as a silly party game for adults. It's over in a couple of minutes so play a few games in a row. Especially try a variant where players have to be silent and only use actions to indicate what they want to pair with.

I can barely call this a game, its more like an extremely stupid adult shouting activity. But by God, not one single adult I've ever played with has not loved it. It lasts two minutes, and will entertain 5-6 people. Don't do less. This is a definite RECOMMEND! It just works so well as an ice breaker, or to end game night with a smile. Ironically, everything about this screams kids activity, but they cannot handle the chaos or be heard with some overenthusiastic adults.

This is a straight up speed game of pure silliness.  Each player has a deck of 12 cards and the first player to get rid of their cards wins.  You have one "active" card at a time, and you can discard it by finding another player with the same card and performing the appropriate action on the card - high five, swapping places, doing a happy salmon (which is like an awkward hand shake), or a fist bump.  The game is real time, so everyone is shouting and rushing to try to find someone to help them get rid of their cards.

It felt exactly like [thing=140][/thing], except with the addition of breaking some personal space / comfort zone boundaries by making you do things like the happy salmon.  Personally, I think it's great when a game makes you do something you wouldn't normally do.  Charades, Time's Up, etc. have a similar result.

Ultimately, it's like 3 minutes long and everyone will have a good time.  Seems like the perfect game to bring along and play when the mood strikes.

I don't see why this has so many low ratings. It's a two minute party game and is very successful at what it does.

I'm usually instantly against games that have you acting out in goofy ways, but this one really keeps it contained. The only "act out" things you do are a high five, a fist bump, and the "happy salmon" handshake-thing. There's also a card that has you switch places with someone else, but they even included a variant where you just swap cards in case you don't want to be switching places with people, or if you play with someone who has limited mobility.

A solid game to play a few rounds at the start of a game night.

You can play it loudly, silently, with movement or without movement (switcheroo) - works great at family gatherings and among mixed generations.  Great seeing a 5 year old fist bump an 80 year old.

This is decent fun to break out with adults but really only if some haven't played before. The novelty quickly wears off. Kids love it though and it's a great one for that reason. If I was rating as a kids game it would be a 7.3

This game is a bit of a mess and while it has some nice ideas it really could have done with another go through the development cycle before I got my hands on it. I'm sure it's the sort of game that repeated plays would mean the lights get switched on for you but I have no real desire to go back and find out

Un gran eurogame, infravalorado o muy poco conocido, clásicas mecánicas de selección de acciones y curiosa mecánica de los "regalos", a quien has dado el regalo de más valor, está obligado a apoyarte en votaciones decisivas del juego :) Una regla muy temática para el fondo del juego. Perfecto para 5 jugadores.

At heart Confucius is pretty standard worker placement with a big chunk of your victory points coming from area (ministry) control.  Two things raise Confucius above the ordinary.  The first is the gift giving that sets up an obligation to support the giver.  This opens up a lot of potential for clever play.  The second is that Confucius is in many ways evocative of its theme.  My one gripe is with the paltry end-game scoring. A single point for Chief Minister seems out of kilter with up to eight points for controlling a single ministry.

The production quality of Confucius is decent. I found the artwork a mixed bag.  The box design and official tiles are nicely done, but much of the board is quite ugly, if entirely functional.  I found the rules poorly written and tiresomely repetitive.

One play with full compliment of 5. After a couple of hours, I felt like I'd been given an Imperial Examination. (Happy, Chris?)
Seriously...for me the game pushes a lot of the same buttons as In The Shadow Of The Emperor, which I never particularly liked.

RATING: 5
I found Confucius to be a gamer's game that was not particularly elegant or interesting. Once was definitely enough.

Thematically, I found it dull, as I spent the whole game trying to bribe officials (little chits without any particular attribute other than how much it took to bribe them), while maliciously trying to give gifts to other teammates, and avoid having them give me gifts. Fun? Not really.

Original in a game? Perhaps. If you are the kind of person who enjoys dreading receiving gifts from friends in real life, this is the game for you. Weird. But in a perverse, reverso sort of way, it almost makes sense. If one of your friends gives you a gift, you sort of owe them something. Want to explore that uneasy feeling? For two hours? By all means, play Confucius.

The worker placement and sailing aspects of the game manage to feel dull and uninspired. Yawn. The board is not particularly interesting, with very little real strategic spatial elements.

About the only "hey that is fun!" element to the game is the way that you can "upgrade your money" each turn. Not surprisingly, like hummingbirds going crazy at a feeder, when we played, we spent most of our time there! Time to go bribe somebody and maliciously give gifts to friends now! No, thanks. I want to exchange my money again!

Nov 2012, after two plays: There's a game here, but I'm not sure that I like it.  Too many restrictions from gifts make it seem difficult to play the political game.  It's also not clear that the game isn't too tight economically: it always seems like everyone spends either one or two cubes getting income each turn.

+ Cute theme, and the gifts mechanism is something that felt new about this one.
- Other than the mentioned gifts gimmick, it's just another standard euro that adds a number of rules just for the sake of complexity. And it's way too long.

RATING: 8
This game is a collection of several nice mechanism.  The students use a voting/auction mechanism, while the advisors are basically a somewhat disguised area control mechanism.  The army element is a more traditional area control while the navy element has the feel of economic development with a touch of brinkmanship.  All these elements have interactions with each other which creates an interesting game, but the heart of the game is the player to player gift exchanges.  If the game is played without good use of the gifts, players will race to grab the advisors and other positions and the game will end early.  If played with gifts properly, players will spend more time positioning to make moves.  This will lead to a slower game, but one in which the play is far more interesting.  Since the game plays best when actually played slower, the game is likely to play better with fewer players.  Aim for 3 or 4 players and try to avoid playing with 5.

Not a bad game per se,  but very difficult to work out the effects of particular actions- did my head in!  We made the stupid mistake (mostly) of ignoring "easy" points (and cards) for Junks & Armies.  I piled into ministries and had almost nothing to show for it at the end.  Part of this was clearly down to me playing badly, but I'm not sure I would do much better next time,  and I'm not prepared to spend 2+ hours (plus nearly a hour explaining the rules to any new players).

gift giving is very novel and very well executed. the game seems very meaty, but then again there didn't seem too many strategies.

with 4 I've seen almost a deadlock with noone able to bribe anyone, and it seemed like the there's not much chance the game the officials will be scored at all before game end

with 5 the last round had 3 players voting which of the leading 2 should win. bad aftertaste, an ending like that.

still, the game seems interesting, is very novel, so it gets a hopeful 7.5...

RATING: 6
Medium weight euro with various mechanics that doesn't seem to add up to an exciting game for me. I do find the theme interesting, but in my only game with three players, after figuring out the rules there did not seem to be many interesting decisions. Everything appeared rather obvious, with one having to decide on which areas to concentrate and score points. The chief minister token to decide who goes last seems like a useless gimmick. You cannot use it on the same person twice and it seems to just go around the table, so no real choice there apparently. Its worth another game with 4-5 players to confirm my firm impression of a rather superficial game.

Update: With four players the game improves and the points are tight. I managed to pull a win 1 point ahead of 2d place. Despite a combination of various mechanics this game simply does not excite me. It reminds me of In the Shadow of the Emperor.

:d10-4: Play with all variants.

2011: The two-value currencies create absolutely no tension, since a high value of one currency equals a low value of the other. You just use the currency for whichever action it has the most value. The Emperor's Rewards, and thus discovering new lands, are much more lucrative than attacking foreign territories. Besides this, you don't have to rely on anyone else to take the victory points. Ties are broken in different manners in different parts of the board, which rather than pushing the players toward breaking the tie with one final action, only encourages the players to find the best way to take advantage of the convoluted tie-breaking mechanisms. The gift-giving mechanic is the sole redeeming part of this game, and that's not enough for me ever to play Confucius again.

RATING: 8.5
First Play: Although conversant with the basic rules we didn't really appreciate the interaction between roles and it's clear that the first game needs to be written off to experience (especially as I came hideously last).

The game has the classic hallmark of a player wanting to do alot more than can be achieved each turn. As a result, you need to think 2 or 3 turns ahead. 

The only randomness is the draw of coin cards at at one stage I needed cash, drew 6 over 2 actions and ended up with 5 ones and a two. That is a weakness but needs a house rule to sort that out. The balance of money vs licenses don't quite seem to work.

The nuances of being beholden to a gift and the effect that has on the final totalling of the Ministries is stunning. Can't wait til the next game.


A very clever and heavy game, but easily over in less than 2 hours with 5 players.

Second Play: It gets better and better. A classic plate spinning exercise requiring opposition to be kept in check whilst pumping up the points. Up graded to 8.5. A lovely game.

Initial impression:

Rather disappointed.

The gifting idea is a great one, just poorly executed here.  It is only relevant for ~1/2 of the game mechanisms leading to points, while the fleet and the armies do not utilize it at all.  

The scoring comes in far too discrete of chunks, where a random card draw can easily lay waste to your well-crafted plan, losing you out on ~1/2 of the points you receive elsewhere for victory.

I would like to see a similar game which has been developed in a different direction to reflect these issues.  I will not likely be playing this one again soon.

Playtest version - provisional rating (especially as there was some confusion over the rules). A nice heavy game which felt very thematic - there is lots of scheming and the central mechanic of gift giving to create obligations works nicely. However, it felt like there was too much chaos around the resolution of the ministries - we had invested over 2 hours in building power bases, only to find that the right play of a single bribe on the final round could win the ministry for somebody with no previous interest. As the 3 ministries are the biggest source of victory points in the game, this section did not feel right to me.
2nd Play - some 9 years later with my own copy. Happy with the rules changes which made the game much less chaotic. Everything I liked about it originally is still there. Nice.

Es un juego de colocación de trabajadores en el que los jugadores pugnan por tener influencia en tres ministerios de la dinastía ming.
La gran novedad es el uso de los regalos.  Cuando haces un regalo a otro jugador le dejas comprometido y tiene que apoyarte en ciertos momentos clave. Es una de las partes más importantes y novedosas del juego. No se parece a otros juegos.
Las reglas son densas. No son complicadas,pero las distintas partes del juego están relacionadas entre sí, y el tema de las mayorías se ve alterado por el uso de regalos. Puede resultar un poco confuso al principio, pero  una vez que se le coge el punto, es un buen juego.

Eso sí, por lo farragoso de las explicaciones, está fuera del alcance de gente que no sea jugona.

RATING: 6
The game has some interesting mechanisms, e.g. the binding of opponents by giving them gifts and the subtle changes in majorities caused by it.
However, the influences and chain-reactions caused when evaluating a minstry are just too obscure and intricate for my taste. I don't see that they really can be planned in advance (at least in a 5 player game). 
In our first game the outcome was rather arbitrary with 3 players tied at 17 points and another with 16 points. As nobody had looked up the tie breaker(s) in advance, the endgame was rather a letdown.

All in all, the game materials are OK, although the board is quite busy (e.g. lots of boxes with text and I, for one, was also confused by the gift table (interchanging given and received gifts etc.) and the standard pawns as armies are disappointing. However, I do like the public servant tiles.

Perhaps the rating might go up with more plays and a better grip on all the details.

Fairly meaty game of multiple paths to victory through action selection. 

The gifts are definitely at the heart of the game.

A few potential small problems: kingmaking and the military track VPs seem very risky and harder to complete. AP towards endgame as everyone works through the cascade of gifts for the resolution of ministries.

Based on one game at Essen 2008. Will need to reassess.

This is an interesting and pretty unique game but is no lightweight - definitely gamers' game territory.  The interactions caused by the fifts is probably the most difficult factor to absorb - I think there are depths there to plumb on further plays (and a chance we'll treat their affect on bribes correctly as we missed that first time round).  Not quite convinced by the end-game scoring but perhaps a better understanding of the rules will make them seem more convincing too.

An interesting action selection game with a bit of a point salad going on. That the points are pretty coarse makes it much more palatable. That the gift-giving mechanism is so different from anything I've seen really brings this game up a point. That said, it is still, under it all, a type of game that is not my favorite.

Also, it probably should never be played with 5. Just too many people scrambling for the ministries rushes the game. Just too little time for the military expeditions and voyages to pay off and compete.

RATING: 7.5
Unless you've a strong stomach for multi-player chaos do not teach the game with more than 3 players.  I suspect the game is best with 4 players.  Once players have a handle on it, then move up to 4 players.  5 players works and possibly works well, but I'm not completely sure it is stable.  The three player game works but is weak in that the full power and interest of gifting cannot be expressed with that low a player count.  It is hard to appreciate gifting until the guy with a single bribed minister wins an 8 point ministry due to clever deployment of gifts.

This is a subtle teasing game of setting up tied situations which resolve in your favour;  It is a game of favours, temptations and simple raw exploitation of implied advantages.  The gifts are really the heart of the game and provide a fascinating and wonderously nuanced decision space.  A player who manages their gifts well will slaughter players that don't.  

Start with both variants from the get-go.  They improve the game without much added complexity.  Petitioning the emperor makes both gifting and gift valuation more interesting.  The win going to the Admiral in the case of ties is simply internally consistent as well as providing an utterly delightful machination.

I also strongly recommend using the draughting variant for the Emperor's Reward cards: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/354139

RATING: 8
Confucius is the game I've wanted Martin Wallace to write ever since Princes of the Renaissance, and the game I wish he'd made instead of Struggle of Empires. Thematically it's a game of intrigue, exploration, and military conquest in the Ming Dynasty. Players use their limited actions to compete in three theaters, each with a different focus. The naval exploration is about speed and efficiency: players purchase junks and then run them out to 'distant lands' in order to collect, ummm, VP chits and bonus cards. The military stuff is the same idea, but is so expensive and slow that cooperation among players will be essential in order to successfully conquer the regions. Successful conquest of these areas yields--wait for it--VP chits and bonus cards.

Third, there is an area influence game where players compete for positions (uhhh, VP chits) in three ministries. When a ministry fills up with influence markers, it gets scored. The players with the most and second-most influence in the region take the VP chits. Here's the title's major hook: during the game, players can give 'gifts' to one another which saddle the recipient with obligations. A giftee can't have more influence in a region than his gifter and must temporarily donate all of his influence to him when ministries are scored. There is a sub-game related to these influence wars that incorporates a kind of voting, and if you've been given a gift, your vote is bought.

The gifting network gets tangled very quickly. Unlike most influence games, turf wars in this game mostly occur not at the point of buying influence directly, but at the derivative level of controlling other players' eventual influence through gifts set up like dominos. It's not easy but it's very, very well-done.

Confucius is a little underbaked and overwrought. It suffers from a few rough edges, though it's hard with some games to tell if the edges are truly 'rough' or just different. For example, there are three ways to take actions: one with cubes, one with cards, and one with neither. There are two ways of passing--one uses a cube and one does not. On a player's turn, he has a staggering number of actions to choose from. Everything is straightforward, but the effect is something similar to: "On your turn, you may choose to execute any of Die Macher's 15 phases!" Sure, they're all easy. On the other hand, one wonders if a more programmed turn would have developed had the game been worked on for longer.

All in all, a fine effort. It's very much a spiritual relative of Wallace's best big-box games and has some great, brand new ideas of its own. For fans of Warfrog's output, this is practically a must-buy.

Tentative rating based on my understanding of the rules and my feeling for its intricacies. Definitely a game I want to keep in my collection, as it has unique mechanisms, afaik.

Since soloing a bit to learn the rules yesterday, it is stuck in my mind. I did not appreciate the tightness of the design to start with, and did oh so many things wrong.

The rulebook tries to be comprehensive including an overview, an explanation of all components and examples, but is instead mediocre and does not help with onboarding. Definitely a disservice to the game. Graphical design is mediocre (especially in some areas like the shipyards and oceans), but that does not influence the game per se.

This is a game of negotiation, intrigue and careful scheming. If you are an experienced gamer, you must play this game.

RATING: 7
Confucius is a hard game to rate, as it has several more layers than average and it feels almost Wallace-esque in execution; i.e.: gamey, some artificial mechanisms but they are all there for a reason. In a certain sense, I think the difficulty is because it seems to lack a central focus of play. You have limited actions, yet you're using those to gain currency which are used for area majority fights, races, and military conquest.

At its most simplistic Confucius is a game where you have limited actions represented by cubes that are placed out into action boxes and then executed. It's not a worker placement game though, as the placement of cubes by other players in a given action box has no effect on you, but you are forced to use more cubes if you want to take the same action (or closely related action) twice in the same round. The actions available allow you to do a huge variety of things, most of which either give you cards (currency) or allow you to place pieces or affect the 3 major scoring areas of the game.

One of the aforementioned scoring methods comes in the form of area influence battles which are themed to bribing officials in three different ministries of the government: one gives discounts on military pieces, one of which gives discounts on naval pieces, and one of which just gives discounts on bribing more people in that area and the other two. Each "person" in the ministry has a bribe cost, and to secure you control of that person you need to pay the price twice. One of the sub-games present involves having a majority of people in a given section (military, navy, finance) in your pocket. This is one major source of VPs. The other two major sources of VPs are going on voyages which involves buying ships and then sailing them to gain VPs and special cards. The other involves buying military pieces and then putting them toward battles which can score a lot of VPs as well. These are the core ways to score points, and they all rely upon the money/license deck, a deck of cards that has depictions of money and licenses in some combination: 3/1, 2/2, 1/3. All of the ways I mentioned above that lead to scoring rely on these cards being spent, and you churn through the deck regularly. Luck of the draw here did not seem to be a vague issue for me.

So, summary of the major ways to score: area influence fight x 3 (money), boats going on voyages (money / licenses, Race element), military (often high money cost, licenses, some risk can be involved (player determined, not random) but rewards can make it worthwhile.)

There is also one other major mechanic that deserves mention: gifting. This is absolutely evil and ingenious. Each player has a sequence of gifts they can purchase ranging in value from 1-6 inclusive. For an action you can give a gift to another player. This will then force them to help you in a variety of circumstances, such as when you're trying to get control of an apprentice (an important sub-game that allows you to take over an official in one of the 3 ministries and possibly displace someone else). It also prevents them from placing pieces such that they would gain a majority in one of the 3 departments if you already hold it, which is a huge pain in the side. There are a variety of other situations like this as well, but I won't go into it at further length since this explanation is already extremely verbose. In short, there are numerous circumstances in which you have to help someone who has given you a nice gift. You can make them indebted to you if you give them something even nicer, or you can give them major help in a variety of ways to simply discard their gift without giving them another gift in return. Again, without the board and all of the mechanics explained my description is lacking, but trust me, this is novel and fun in practice.

Suffice to say, there are a lot of layers to the action here. The game isn't all that difficult to get moving on though, and though the rules explanation is a pain because of how many things there are, it's a fairly easy game to grok right out of the gates. I think the varying systems here create some interesting decisions. I also love the gift mechanism, it's completely brilliant and I've never seen anything else like it in another game...this is absolutely worth playing once just to experience it in action.

The game does have a few rough edges, which is standard for indie publishers. The most glaring is the end game scoring, which is laughably small, and could probably be tossed altogether for the sake of streamlining the game. The mish-mash of mechanisms will probably overwhelm many people as well, obscuring the fact that the overall game concept and play is not altogether difficult to grasp once the actual thing gets into motion. I'm rating this conservatively for now, because I don't know how often I would specifically be in the mood for this. But as I have said, there are some quite original ideas here, and this is well worth checking out. If I have any critiques, it's the lingering doubts I have that there are any real innovations or truly interesting ideas here beyond that gift mechanic.

On a final aside: one of the more entertaining insults available here is to call someone "Mr. T" when they have more than one gifted necklace in front of them during the game.

I totally get the Martin Wallace comparisons. Very tight point-wise. One complaint some players shared is that it's so tight that you could point to a single bad luck draw of cards as the game loser. Well, my counter is that you draw cards like 12+ times, so it's probably easy to remember the one draw that screwed you and forget the 2 or 3 that were exactly what you need. I do agree that money is slightly more useful than permits (or whatever they're called--I forget). But you can mostly deal with that, I think, once everyone understands the relative worth. There is a LOT of player interaction. The whole gift system I find really intriging, i.e. giving a gift that actually does help tyhem a little (get more actions on their turn), but actually makes them indebted to you which helps in a few ways. I like that there are three totally separate ways to go after vp, and it's pretty transparent, except in one it's majority control, in one it's a race, and in one it's sort of co-op. The majority control one is the one that gets nasty, at least in our one play. So again, players can choose to battle in there, or not, at their discretion.

Confucius is an interesting game, but also one which is difficult to 'label'. At first glance it appears to be an action point game in which the players, imagining themselves nobles in the' Chinese Ming dynasty, attempt to transform money and licenses into VP (through sea voyages and military conquest) or money into political influence in the various ministries which in turn yields VP too. These little subgames are not very complex and are in fact rather boring were it not for [i]the[/i] thing which makes Confucius Confucius: gifts. Gifts are bought and then given to other players, putting them under an obligation towards you. They must, for example, support your candidates for the ministry in favour of their own; or side with you when it is time to choose a minister for a department. Gifts introduce all sorts of limitations which you really do not want nor need.

The result is a rather interesting melange of backstabbing and hindring other players without outright dealmaking: the system does not allow you to make deals turning it into a 'every player for themselves' kinda thing. All of a sudden those other simple objectives become rather difficult to attain, requiring careful management of your scarce financial resources. Cancelling a gift from another player is after all a costly affair, and said moneys could probably have been spent elsewhere in a more leisurely and more surely VP-yielding fashion. Now this game should be rife with multiplayer chaos, and to some extent it is—but because the other mechanisms have been kept simple and rather straightforward, it doesn't make me uncomfortable. 

All in all a pleasant gaming experience. That is not to say it was all roses. Given that money and licences are an important resource, the fact that you get these more or less randomly throws a wrench into your plans on more than one occasion. The rule forbidding you to carry over too much of these items to the next round means that it becomes extra difficult to manage what you are doing. All players suffer from this scarcity, so it is not a truly big deal, but it does give the game a somewhat artificially constrained feel. It's a bit like trying to plug a hole into a leaky bucket with a plug which is not entirely reliable. Still, an interesting title which will definitely see more play in the future.

[b]Update[/b] Repeated plays have unfortunately done little to dispell the notion that the lack of financial resources becomes an annoying drain on one's actions. Given that you need 4 or 5 Confucius cards to do useful things on a turn, and that obtaining these from scratch takes two actions at least, it just leaves you with three other actions at most to spend the cards. That's not a lot. Also, the foreign land invasions just stop at some point, rendering this path next to useless for the remainder of the game. Matters become dreary and repetitive then. It is simply not a good sign that after the end of every game you look at the board and wonder what all the hubbub was about, really. Gifts are still a brilliant invention of course, but the game they are imbedded in feels sterile and seems to lack ambition. Downgraded by 1 point.

[b]Update 2[/b] Sold off. An intruiging concept which unfortunately failed to perform in the way I wanted.

Tremendo el juego, original, con muchas opciones, la mecánica de los regalos genial !

Plays like a Warfrog or Splotter design, but isn't.  Very well-implemented mechanics with an Eastern theme.  Brain burner.  Plenty of tough decisions.  Nice bits and production quality to boot. Novel gift-giving/obligation mechanic.

My lack of confidence in being able to teach this well along with the low popularity makes this title hard to get to the table.

The rules read like an entrance exam for the Confucion Public Service. I faded in and out and had no idea before I started play.
But its actually a pretty straight forward influence in areas game with a multitude of ways to earn VPs, limited actions and an overiding cashflow element. All the things I love in a good euro and I enjoyed playing this one.
Finally, the "gift obligation" machanic is a nice new mechanism I haven't seen before and creates all sorts of new impacts on gameplay. Particularly the way a gift can help your opponent (possible extra action) at the same time as limiting thier choices (give your votes to me).
Good stuff once you're into it.

Amazing area-influence game that captures intrigue and influence peddling better than anything I've seen yet. Far more tangible than El Grande (another of my faves I'll admit).

Excellent production value and a very worthwhile package, kudos to this small-but-excellent outfit!

By end of the game, is possible to be shoe-horned into only one possible route of action. No catch-up mechanic that seems likely functional.

Deep game with a lot of theme, not too much "light fun", instead a lot of hard decisions, tension and backstabbing - Ming China, remember? Pretty hard to get into it first, but gameplay is smooth enough then.
I want to play this more! Maybe the rating will be adjusted after more games, but right now my top game to play.
I have two copies, one pre-ordered and one I got surprisingly for helping with the German translation - so I can (mis)use one of them for customizing the board and bits ... I got some ideas ...

Theme may be great but just too long and fiddly, i.e., little bits of rules that you have to remember but have a great impact on gameplay. Yes, the gifting mechanism is clever but opens up a Pandora's Box of AP especially in contests over the ministries. Just too overwrought to be worth playing again for me, which is a shame because the game has the Ming dynasty flavour.

RATING: 4.5
Disappointed. A vastly over-complex rules set with many repetitions of the same rules (the same rules ideas are explained in great detail many times)(there's a lot of repeating of the same mechanisms in very long sentences with Many Capital Letters)(it looks like an actual lawyer wrote these rules with Multiple Repetitions Of Detailed Points (see the detailed point multiple repetitions clause 3.2.7 on Page 22)) hides an essentially simple set of choices.

There's a basic problem in this game. At best, you have 5 actions. But it takes 2 actions to generate income (money/licenses) and it takes 2 actions to resolve ships or armies into VPs (and armies are very unlikely to succeed anyway), so the only valid choices are going after officials and students. The gifts takes 2 actions, buy a gift then give it, but influence does help win students and ministries.

The game ends up being a large, long exercise in pointless choices unless you made the right choice very early on. There's no way to come back into the game and it feels more like an educational exercise than a game. There is something buried away here, and experience tells me that a German editor would have hacked away to reveal the heart. but a Brit designer is stuck with complexity for complexities sake.

Play before you buy. Not on my wishlist.

Even though I had read good opinions about this game on BGG, the graphics on box and board were so unappealing to me, I wasn't interested in playing.  However, the game was brought out, and of course I played, and was so impressed, it is now on my want list.  The bribe aspect rules the game and sometimes makes it hard to determine who can win.  Our 4 player game was tight and the winner could have been any one of us--it came down to the last play and who had received what bribes.

You know, I was taught this with the wrong rules, and they've slowly been corrected over my 4 plays, each time making the game a little more chaotic, with my final play culminating in the use of the advanced rules that just pushed it over the edge entirely.  The gift system in this game is awesome.  Just one little favor owed here or there can tip the game in your favor.  This game initially was a very interesting game of layered efficiencies, but it's clear now that it's actually a brutal game of screwage-management.  I wouldn't mind playing this with a group of players that really get the game, but I don't see ever getting to that point.  I'm afraid this one will be gathering dust on the shelf for the rest of its days.  :(

Confucius is going to appeal to fans of mid-to-heavy strategy games.  The intertwining of the various action choices make the decision tree bear fruit.  I found the game rather Wallacesque, which increased its appeal for me, and look forward to losing again.

RATING: 5
(Rating for a 3 player basic game, I'm under the impression that the gift mechanism works quite differently with more players.)

A few original ideas buried under an over-long management game with majority-style scoring. I like the idea of giving gift, unfortunately it seems to create some uninteresting situations where two players exchanging the same gift get stalemated and can't advance their majority. Also, there can be a tendency to rush to the 6-valued gift. All-in-all, this feel like an under-developed mechanism.

Another problem is the somewhat repetitive turns, where you dig for money first and grab some points after. Also, the way you grab points (war, exploration, majority) usually do not create much tension.

The final problem is that in the late game some actions become void. There is no point in building soldiers if there are no more wars. No point in building ships if there is no exploration left... So the game turns into simple majority-grabbing.

There is also the potential for painful kingmaking in the late-game, when the third man has same-value gifts from both other players and choose who gets the big payout. (It's not even possible for this third player to stay out since he has to choose one side or the other!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The giving and receiving of gifts is the central element of Confucius. Gifts set up obligations for other players, and even just threatening with a gift can be a powerful move. This part of the game is quite fascinating. The rest of the game, unfortunately, is a little lackluster, and the random card draws often push players in specific directions without giving them a lot of choice in the matter. Towards the end of the game, many actions also become fairly useless, likely leaving some of the players with nothing to do. Additionally, points are handed out in very large batches compared to the final tally which means that even minuscule differences in board position result in huge swings in scoring.

This is the type of game that makes people hate euros.  If they just changed a few letters after the prefix in the title it would at least be thematically driven (con-fucius --> con-voluted). What somewhat appears at first to be an interesting mechanic, the "favor" is essentially fatally flawed.  Having no control over when you wish to adopt influence can make expensive gifts worthless (some may claim this to be part of the strategy, but the investments are too high for the risk, so with that thinking they would never be used).  
Confucius is a clunky beast, with what feels like broken elements in the design, has a mess of interacting parts, and also manages to feel derivative of all the worst elements in euro games.

Mixed feelings on this area majority style game.  The action selection is reasonable, and the gift mechanism is noteworthy.  However, even with the gifts forcing players to support the gift giver, there is a noticeable king-making element.  If you are the perceived leader in the middle or later part of the game, players with a choice will always break against you.  It reminded me of Struggle of Empires in this respect, but didn't have the hidden features of scoring to mitigate that problem like SoE does.  Overall a likeable, if somewhat complicated design.

the interesting part of the game is the gifting/obligation mechanism, and using that to leverage more actions and one's position mainly in relation to the ministers. The rest of the game is sort of a standard worker placement/action draughting to turn money/licenses into vps.

The Essen 08 Fair favorite for me and the worst ranked game in my collection. A wonderful game of majorities with clever mechanics. The gifts are something really new and refreshing for the boardgames industry; at last something really original among a lot of games based in, althogh not bad, really old mechanics. The result is a subtle system, and to survive in this web of obligations and rights among the players, you will need a lot of skill and be really accurate in your actions and your strategies. About the number of players, I find the perfect number to be four, this gives you more control of the situation. I do recomend the open emperor cards variant.

One game in. A lot to wrap your head around. The end game is filled with "what ifs" and drama. The gift giving mechanism is so central to this game. It mitigates chaos, and lets you plan strategically. Lots of moving parts, but pretty smooth. Hope to do better next game in. Lots of interactivity going on. Close scores. THE MINISTRY RESOLUTION PHASE ROCKS. It shows how a peon, can still win office, if he plays his cards (literally) properly.  

NOT A GAME TO BE PROPERLY GROK'D THE FIRST TIME. A DEFINITE LEARNING CURVE. If played JUST ONCE, i believe the criticisms leveled at it may be correct. 
But there is a deep game here.

There is very limited opportunities to score points. You MUST keep that in mind the entire time. When you play the game for what it is, not what you thought it was going to be, I think it works.

One play with four. Unfortunately, we missed an important rule, which is that gifts prevent players from bribing officials in some instances. I think we got a fairly good feel for the game, though. Overall I thought it was quite good, with the exception of the "bribery" Emperor Reward cards, which seemed too powerful. Of course, I may be biased about that because I was the one that got keelhauled by one of those cards....regardless, I think it would be interesting to try a variant in which the Emperor Rewards are changed to a set reward, which is a couple of Confucius cards and a free action to be used whenever.

Rating after one 5player game. Further plays may change my opinion. Generally a solidly designed game for gamers. I liked until the final round where the player that got the last "student" turned out to be a Kingmaker in the ministry. This makes the outcome of the game unpredictable as the victory points are narrow spreaded between players. When you draw for money there are also some lucky players and others. However I won my first game, but was made king otherwise only second.

4-player only (for us).

Alterations/House rules: Admiral variant always; 'Petition the Emperor' variant is also considered essential; the variant that flips the 'Emperor's Rewards' cards and displays them entirely; also thinking about having all of the ministers known by using some token to show when they aren't available yet; possibly flip the 'candidate officials' too.

Touchstones: Thoughtful tie-breaking game; Risk management; Asymmetrical endeavors (with the armies slower than the rest); Fractional incentive management; Gifts are hard to manage and may have great consequences towards the end; Player controlled ending.

This game responds to baiting and luring opponents to aid one another.

Confucius is an... interesting game, probably in the Chinese sense.

It's a worker placement, with reasonably tight money, and action counts deteremined by #gifts given and received- the concept of the gift creating a debt being reasonably central to this game.

But I'm not certain that this is the only key- making best use of the moves one has, and optimizing any extra actions seems as key, or perhaps even more so.

I have a solo 4-player learning game in, and the winner had the least number of actions at the end, but was one of the first to add an extra action.  They ended up as Chief Minister (grabbing Hubu) and as General. They also had the most Emperor's Favour cards of any player.

Anyway, based on the 1st play I hesitated, but have to rate this a 7.

It's not straight forward to see whom is ahead in the is game, nor is it guaranteed that it will stay that way for long, and this adds to the political one-upsmanship and gift-giving chicanery.

It's long on theme for a worker placement, and it's truly an interesting game.

I like it quite a bit with a couple of caveats. Trying to explain this is more intimidating than most Euros. With the group of game tourists I play with I've decided it isn't worth the hassle. You need some people who are going to commit to a couple of plays relatively close in time to one another.

Some of the mechanics do feel a bit thrown together. They are intended to provide alternate paths to victory but thematically it hurts the game. The ministry resolution is clearly the heart of the game, its big selling point, its main attraction.

It feels like it a bigger company picked it up and spent more time developing it, streamlining it, they could have an all-time hit on their hands.

An intricate game with several paths to victory.  No direct conflict, but lots of ways of advancing your position to the detriment of others.  There are cards/actions that radically change the game position.  However, you learn to take these possibilities into account when planning your moves.

Rules are straighforward and clearly written with good quality game components.  The only change I'd like to see is the removal of the tan background on the card faces - too dull and too similar to card backs so you end up looking at the card backs instead of the fronts, showing everyone your hand by accident.

Neat game for the gamers out there - not a light family game - akin to Die Macher in style and complexity.

Básicamente se trata de un juego de control de áreas (mayorías) con una mecánica de colocación de trabajadores. Lo que le hace destacar por encima de la media es la mecánica de los regalos (que obliga al que los recibe a prestar ayuda al donante en votaciones y control de áreas hasta que se deshace de ese regalo). Esto origina una serie intrincada de relaciones complejas entre jugadores. Entraría en el panteón de los Eurgames Pesados junto con Trajan, Vinhos, Le Havre... PROS: inmersivo y el maquiavelismo de la mecánica de los regalos. CONS: No recomendado para turistas y picaflores. Difícil jugarlo las veces que requiere para que el juego sea redondo.

After 1 play.

I expected to be stunned, but I was not impressed...
I like gift mechanics very much, but I find other elements uninteresting (sea expeditions and military campaigns) and even annoying (battles for ministries - unoriginal and prone to kingmaking).  Also - mechanics of promoting students seems completely unintuitive to me and only once I tried to exploit it.  I failed completely and punishment is severe in that case (might be unbalanced).  Needless to say - I don't like this mechanics.

As a whole I do not find the game exciting.  STILL, I'm willing to give it another chance as we played with horribly twisted and incorrect rules which might impact my assessment to some degree.

[I played 4-player game; reportedly 5-player game is an excersie in kingmaking so I'm not going even to try this option]

RATING: 7
The first thing you notice is it has a great theme and the game is built around the theme so this is already good. Next you notice how dense the rule set is (24 pages!) and how some things do seem a little convoluted, well once you start playing and see all the interaction you have to check the box the make sure Wallace did not design this, nope but it sure feels like it and that is another good thing in this case. 

Don't try to learn this one if you are a little tired, its a very intricate system with a fair amount of rules having some exceptions, most of these are logical however and they all do add up to make a very meaty game. It will take the better part of a game to get things flowing and to start learning about the strategies involved but once you do it is a pretty neat system that will flow good with very little AP surprising, I suspect 2 hour game time once familiar, first probably longer. 

A conquering game where you have 3 main ways to score, sailing to conquer, marching armies to conquer and bribing the ministries of government, this should mean a few paths to discover here. During the game there are lots of things to watch for and the hardest and most important is the gift giving having multiple effects including a bit of metagaming and some dirty play. These gifts are the heart of the game, its a brilliant mechanic that helps and hinders people depending of who has given and received. 

So far all great stuff, now the big question, with all this gift giving it does inherently set up some kingmaking. During the game this seems fine for the most part, you have some control over it and you can see who is winning and try to sway things out of their favour, this is really part of the game and something you have to accept. Where this could spoil the game is in the end, if a winner can be determined by this kingmaking then that wouldn't be too cool, I'm not sure yet if games could be decided in this way. 

The military path seems a little expensive and it is definitely risky. It has a timer built in to it and if certian lands are not conquered before the timer runs out you lose all your investment, the last half of the game is even harder than the first. This seems to invite a co-op and negotiation aspect in order to avoid the risk but there is nothing in the rules about that so read it how you want, you could allow it or not, I'm not sure which way fits the game better, both could work. Without it does seem a little tough to go this way and some players will cooperate anyway but you will never know for sure making it more risky and screwage prone. 

All in all a very cool system I'm looking forward to playing more. 

[b]UPDATE:[/b] 8.25 => 7 Damn! Such a cool system with the gifts that are truly evil and fun but ohhhh the kingmaking. There is quite a bit of 'carpet pulling' here which does end up feeling chaotic unfortunately then add to this the damn cards included...yikes! 

5 players ends up being too tight and too convoluted in general with the gifts generating some AP in the ministry resolution especially near the end, talk about domino effects. 3 wont be interesting enough so now this is strictly a 4 player game for us.  

I fear this is going to end up an 'experience' game like Liberte, fun as hell to play but results may or not be meaningful. We will now be adding a few small tweaks to limit the kingmaking and see how it pans out.

I must say that this is one of the most thought provoking games I have ever played.  This game is not for everyone, and should be played where all players have played before OR all players have not.  In mixed company, I believe the players who have played before would have a very distinct advantage (more so in this game than in others).

That said, I love these type of games. 

Being my first time and with all the things happening in the game you begin to understand what you SHOULD have done once the different parts of the board resolve, so I really want to try this again with players who know the game on the same level as me.

Underwhelmed.

The game is well-balanced and features a nice system of integrated mechanics that lead to points achieved over a series of turns. However, the game wasn't nearly as fun as I had hoped. I wanted to bribe officials in order to do something illegal, instead I was bribing to take a legal action for less money. I wanted to give gifts to others in order to force them into alliance with me, instead the other player could quickly counter with a greater gift or give me his/her tenuous influence over an official. 

There isn't anything particularly wrong with the game, outside of the randomness of Emperor Reward cards, but it isn't fun to play either. Kinda reminded me of my recent plays of In the Shadow of the Emperor; the aging and marrying mechanics like the gifts and bribes, are way cooler in theory than in practice.

This game deserves to be much more well-known than it is; I'm guessing that has a lot to do with it coming from a smaller publisher.  While it does have many euro elements such as action selection, area control, and hand management, don't expect something in the "elegant" streamlined vein of games typically out of Germany.  Rather, this has come from the fevered imagination of a Brit inspired by the complex social mores, political intrigues and foreign endeavors of medieval China.  The result is a beautiful and thought-provoking game design that turns your brain to mush if you try for too long to analyze its intricate webs of social obligations.

The game itself has visually striking artwork and nice wooden components, very impressive for a small-published game!  The rules are well done and have little interesting cultural tidbits peppered throughout.

It's got a spark of inspiration. It's ambitious. Unfortunately it's undercut by an insanely blunt/tight/discrete scoring system. Two few points available in only a handful of large batches.

Great area majority game with an interesting twist around Confucian 'gifts' - if you give another player a gift, they cannot directly act against you until they redeem your gift by doing something actively to help you - makes it highly interactive but the intra-player conflict becomes much more subtle and fun.  Definitely feels like a convoluted game of courtly influence and intrigue.  I don't usually like area majority that much, but this one gets two thumbs up!

I'm really liking the strategies involved in this game.  Limited resources, many things to accomplish, and of course, owing the darned favors!  Getting around this can be frustrating, and is one of the big challenges of the game.  My only concern is that the long voyages are too powerful because of the Emperor's Reward cards.

I'll start off by saying this is one of those games where when its not their turn, players will find something else to do. It isn't a bad game, the system intertwines quite cleverly. But it is very dry and tedious, and the players were never really engrossed in it.

I don't think I will want to play this again. But I can appreciate how some players might find the system unique and clever. So if you're a fan of mid-weight and convoluted, you might want to try this.

RATING: 7.5
Confucius offered an interesting new mechanism in ´gift giving´, which requires other players to vote in your favour in contests. This can only be undone by sacrificing an official or by returning the gift with an even more splendid one.

Otherwise not earth shaking, but fine in its genre

RATING: 4
The first play was not very intuitive, it was hard for me to know what might be a good or a bad move in advance. Additional plays would likely resolve that. The huge variation in value between the special cards played an important role. A major concern to me was that the game seemed to hinge on one or two late game decisions. As it turned out the most important decision was made by the third place player: who to choose as the winner. This type of outome doesn't appeal to me.

RATING: 6
Initial impression.  Interesting.  I liked the concept behind the gifts given, obligations and restrictions attached.  I found the rules to be good - covered several little nit-picky things we wondered about in explicit terms.  Seems like the game has been well tested.

Concerns revolve around potential kingmaking, and the low points accrued.  With relatively few points awarded, the kingmaking power of players in inferior positions seems potentially capricious.

Highly repetitive gameplay, where same tiny moves are done over and over again to get something miniscule done on the board (take money cards, take money cards in an other way, buy army, take money cards, activate the army piece, take money cards etc). Ironically even the rules are repetitive, with same things explained up to four or five times. 

Couple of unique mechanisms spice the game up a bit, but since there really isn't a shortage of worker placement or area majority games, Confucius won't get played often.

The game is overly confusing when you haven't played it. When you are playing it, it's actually okay but you allways find yourself short of either actions, or confucius cards that actually have two purposes influence and money 
they have 3I-1M or 2I-2M or 1I-3M on it and are drawn

This adds some luck to the game as they are drawn and you have a very small hand limit of 4.

I need to play it again to make my mind up.

The game is very complex and you have many possibilities but somehow it is too complex and the rules are not very clear and straightforward.

Confucius tries to mix different kind of things which works fine in other games, but here result isn't THAT good. This is far from uniquest game there is (well, only unique idea is the voting system) and because Conficus is more "I've seen this kind of games too much" + a long lenght (compared what you get) + time what it takes to teach this games means, that this is not for me. Oh, and its ugly looking too...

Takes a while to teach, but not hard once game starts.

Heavy-weight action point game where players are competing for VPs in various arenas.  The brilliance of this game is in the gifting system:  you give a "gift" to someone and they are suddenly obligated to you... they need to vote for you, they lose area control ties, etc.  You can only break the obligation by giving them a more valuable gift or by fulfilling one of your obligations.  The gift system sets up an intriguing domino system once multiple players have multiple gifts from multiple opponents.

There's a lot going on here and more to be explored.

A very elegant game which is put together well.  Several different moving parts but they all mesh nicely.  A couple of unique factors that I liked a lot - the giving and receiving of gifts creates a network of forced working-together-ness (is that a word?) which is fun to manipulate.  The VP resolution for the various ministries is fun, too - players in 3rd place and below must donate their support to one of the two leaders, and the gifts may dictate who gets that support, so again the gift network is fun to manipulate.

Very interesting system. I like the bribery/obligation system as with everyone else, but I do think the system's success in your game group will depend on how much people are willing to negotiate with each other. With the right group this will be a great success.

While I appreciate the fact that game offers multiple victory paths, I also feel like having both the ships and invasions may be a bit too much. In my first game (4 player), 2 players only invested in the ship strategy, which made invasions very difficult to succeed.

Some interesting aspects to this game, particularly the gifts. But there seemed to be too few VP oportunities available. There are 6 in the ministries, 5 in the voyages of discovery, perhaps 8 in the conquests. I leave out the three ways to score a single VP as these get swamped by the others.

So in a 5 player game we only got our hands on the 6 VP chits from the ministries, 3 from the voyages and 2 from conquests. Didn't seem to work.

First impression of the base game, after one play with four. Interesting majority game, with not so interesting added parts where you race for victory points and special cards. It features a new mechanism - gifting. Giving a gift earns the support of the receiving party even against himself. Receiving gifts has only the benefit of getting one or two more actions, which is also gained by giving. Rating may go either way with further play.

Action point optimization and multiple paths to victory. The unique gift mechanism is the heart of the game, and makes for some very interesting decisions and gameplay effects. Even though there are 17 different actions to choose from, there's very little analysis paralysis, and the game does not feel overly complex. A large part of the game is gaining influence on the ministries but the ways to actually achieve that are a lot more original than usually. Also, lots of points can be scored from conquest and exploration as well, so the influence part is not an overly dominant part of the game.

Too bad the graphics weren't improved for the published version.

Though this appears to be a fairly standard euro about Chinese bureaucrats in the middle ages, at the heart of Confucius is a unique mechanic where players give each other gifts in order to create a hierarchy and claim obligations. This gifting mechanic adds considerable complexity and interest to the game and makes me want to revisit Confucius, even though I was rather underwhelmed by the rest of the game. Rating may rise if the layer of complexity proves to reveal interesting strategies and play.

RATING: 7.5
Gioco strategico e interattivo Confucius è un bellissimo prodotto poco noto ma che offre diversi spunti interessanti. Ci troviamo nella Dinastia Ming e ogni giocatore deve cercare di acquisire influenza sui politici nelle varie divisioni. Oltre a corromperli con denari sonanti i giocatori possono offrire doni agli altri giocatori per garantirsi il supporto necessario per far promuovere i propri 'studenti'. L'ambientazione ben ricreata rende il gioco molto piacevole così come l'idea dei doni e delle azioni necessarie per sdebitarsi. Il regolamento non è del tutto fluido e nascone molte regolette e situazioni da ricordarsi anche le carte benefit non sono immediate. La risoluzione delle battaglie e la maggioranza finale nelle varie camere politiche non è immediata. Nel complesso però è un bel goco che necessita di qualche partita di rodagio.

I'm not sure I agree with Tom Vasal's video review. On the contrary, we found it to be a lot of fun BUT I think it is only really fun with a specific audience. If you are a fan of ancient Chinese history and have some knowledge of Confucius and his teachings, you will really enjoy this game. However, if you don't have either of these, you may not enjoy it. There are few games I have played that are as thematic as this one and so (much like Tales of the Arabian Nights) you either appreciate the theme or you probably will not enjoy the game. For me, I enjoyed it very much.   

Four appears to be the ideal number of players for this. Less than that and the gift-giving mechanic (and probably the best mechanic in the game) breaks down and with five, it simply takes too long to play.

This game is just not very good. It's got "action selection" mechanism, which is like worker placement except there is no blocking, which just sucks. 

The cards you get in the game are extremely important (they are the only way you can get gold) so it almost seems like two of your actions every turn are wasted on the two card gathering spaces. In addition, there is an imbalance in the usefulness of the cards. The cards give you influence/gold in total of four in combinations of 1/3, 2/2, and 3/1, except influence is used for MUUUUUUCH less things, and even for those things you need quite a lot of money as well (equal if not more), so the 3/1 money cards are pretty much strictly better than the 1/3s and 2/2s. 

The rules are horribly written, at times seeming to directly contradict themselves.

The board looks like it was put together as an art project by a middle-school student.

Still discovering this, but I'm very impressed so far. The gift giving mechanic is awesome and very well integrated.The game as a whole is deep and rewarding.

I'll give it an 8 for now, but it'll probably go up.

The gifts are a nice idea, and I like them a lot.

I tentatively love this game but after my last game seemed to be decided on a totally unpredictable result in Ministry Resolution due to the horribly swingy Emperor's Reward cards. I need to reserve judgment until I've played a couple more times.

Rating after one play. Rating could very possibly change upon future plays. Problem is, I would only want to play with others who have played before (and if the same group got together I'm pretty sure we would have other games that we would rather play). As it has been commented upon, the gift giving mechanic is original, interesting and key to the game. After riding the rollercoaster of convoluted rules, the game drifts into an easy flow -- much easier than I anticipated -- until the mid-to-end-game where the interactions and obligations can lead to significant AP while trying to determine who and what will be affected by each action. The rules (and the actual action of) resolving the ministries left many a head scratched and some repeatedly. The presentation of the game and the board does not aid in any way the understanding of the sometimes unintuitive rules. Positives: Significantly intricate as a gamers game, much interaction and interesting consequences of actions, gift mechanism is very nice. Negatives: Unintuitive rules with several exceptions (certainly not what I would call elegant), mediocre presentation, length (of rules+game) vs. enjoyment, arbitrary seeming tie-breakers.

In Confucius you can influence your opponent players. If you give them a gift they have to support you when a student is to be promoted into a ministry.
This element reminded me to MIL (1049), a game I now refuse to play. Confucius fortunately is better than Mil but not a game that blows you out of the water.
I think the game material should have supported the game play better. They should have paid better attention to iconography.

Action selection game set during the Ming Dynasty period in China. Players work to get VPs by bribing and securing officials (scored by area majority), Nominating and forcing examinations for students (who are subsequently placed in a Ministry secured by you), Purchasing junks and performing voyages (for VPs and Emperor rewards), collecting income, and building armies and launching invasions (also for VPs). The most innovative mechanic here is the gift-giving one: you can offer a gift to player, which then obligates them to help you in specific ways (e.g. supporing one of your sponsored students, refraining from placing workers in a specific Ministry, etc.) unless they counter your gift with a superior one, which will instead indebt you to them. A heavy design with complex rules and a great deal to keep track of, with outstanding theme integration and good artwork.

One play so far. Confusing to play out of the box without anyone having played it before (same could be said of plenty of decent games), and some passages of the rules add to this by being a bit headachey; but eventually it clicked. Quite a delightful game, really. Is the scoring range too small, and the results of the voting for government office too swingy? Perhaps, but there appears to be a lot of potential here for deep and devious play, leavened by luck, that draw me to playing again.

RATING: 9
Multiple strategic routes, sophisticated player interaction, the need to be paying attention all the time, and a strong thematic feel.  There's always more to do than you can, and the gift-giving adds an extra level of analysis without tipping the game into AP mode.
Note: you do need to play with the Emperor's Favour action though to get the full horror of this game, but definitely not on a first play.

(2017) Still as vicious as it ever was; it feels as though it was too far ahead of its time when it came out, but now feels a bit clunky in places.

Wow.

Tons of interlocking pieces, which a variety of paths to victory.  I like games with tons of options, and this is chock full of things you can do.

This is totally the Wallace game that he never made.  This uses the Wallace - Way out West action selection, and uses it well.  The only thing that might give away the fact that this isn't Wallace is that there are no dice.

Much of this game is comprised of elements that we've seen in other games, but most of this is done in new, or exciting way.  There is a palpable tension as little races start popping up all over the board.  Soon, there is just too much you want to do, and, well, you still have to maintain an income.

The concept of the gifts is great.  In addition to, all the evil manipulation that you can do with them (Oh, it is far better to give than to receive), the number of jokes that can be made with these is fantastic.  

While this is certainly could be difficult for the average light gamer, this fits nicely into the pantheon of heavy Euros.

I do have to add that with 5 players, the number of options of what you can actually do becomes much more constrained.  I'm a big fan of the game with 4, but with 5 it just becomes too sticky for my taste, often channeling people into directions where that is literally their only viable choice.

I like pressure, but this time it seemed like there was too much; could never get enough money to do anything (until late in the game when it was too late); the gifts really limited your ability to play in the ministries; the whole game was just too frustrating! Of course, we were all pretty much newbies -- would like to play it again, with rules fresh in my mind.

A very tense and clever area control game with a bit of randomness, which brings some subtle changes on the strategies that players should pursuit. My first and only game took about 3 hours to play which is a bit too much. Time of play should reduce to about 2 hours of play to be a better game. I also think that the game was built for at least 4 players although it should work better with 5.

1 play. Enjoyed first game if not understood strategy (until too late). R had won by 5th turn as he had taken 3 of 6 available army points. Mistake on other players part not to contest. Gift mechanic works - though petition the emperor not popular as seems to add to much screwage. Out of 4 players 2 liked a lot, 1 so so, 1 hated. 2nd game and not popular with other players. Very subtle and clever game, but needs a serious amount of time invested in the game to get it.

Its a shame that none of my groups have wanted to play this as I think it a really good game but alas sold through lack of use.

Provisional Rating. Excellent majority game with a lot of interation between actions, players and strategies. The ministry strategy is predominant with other strategies to be used complementary.
The gift mechanism is a nice, new one!
We played 2 rules wrong.
First game last night. To be played again. Probably the rating will go up.
Edit. second game a lot better with right rules.
The feeling of having too much to do and few actions is present all over the game.

Essentially an action-point allowance game where you earn VP by being first to achieve certain conquest or exploration objectives or by having most influence in ministries when they are fully staffed. There’s a web of inter-dependencies, central being gifts which impose obligations and constraints on the recipients. One could almost imagine that Die Macher is one of the designer’s favourite games.

Teritory control, but something different because of the gifts. You could have less cubes, but when you give gifts, you could take control of enemy cubes. The problem after one game is - could you control who will have majarity? I won the game with 20 points, but 7 of them was suprisely for everyone! When you could control it, it would be a very original game, when not, it is a very random game.

The armys was unusefull. Much better are ships. You have points and very strong emperor cards. Tha army can bring more points, but its too hard, too costfull to build them.

The most points you get from the ministery, but to have the majaroty there is hard. You must have cubes and give gifts.

Interesting are the gifts and that you could get more actions, but then lose them.

Randomness was a turn off. The end of the only time I played was 21-18-18-18. the game is too low scoring for the random factor. I drew 5 cards from a deck containing an equal amount of 1's, 2's, and 3's, and because I drew 4 1's and a 2 I cost myself 4 points, the difference of the game for me as well as another player it affected.

Worth playing again, but I am hesitant to play more than a couple times to see if my theory applies.

Interesting worker placement game with a number of interesting decisions. The gift mechanism is pretty unique and really alters the flow of the game. Due to the limited points available, the game has a certain tenseness to it each time someone score or achieves anything.

I dropped my rating on this down to a 6.5. The huge limit in points makes things so ridiculously tight that the Confucius cards (the money) can really determine the game. It also seems to really get slow at the end for no good reason.

" Confucius' political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argues that the best government is one that rules through "rites" (lǐ) and people's natural morality, rather than by using bribery and coercion. " 
:P

I was enthousiastic about the theme until i saw what it was really about..
Anyway...
Not a bad game, "Wallace style" in my opinion, but the system in the ministries and who is finally taking the ministry was kind of confusing ..

UNPLAYED so far--the rules are just a beast.  Very thick, very complex.  

I cannot wait to play it though.  

UPDATE:  1 Play, 4P--Another game we learned and played cold, on the spot.  The rules could have been written much better, as I don't feel the game is as hard to teach as the rules make it out to be.  

Further plays will likely shed light on the power of the gift-giving, which I am sure we did not come close to realizing.  

The binding mechanic in the game, that which holds it together and binds players, is the superb obligation mechanic that the gifts present.  Forcing another player to support you, and then trying to work that obligation to its fullest is a great mirror of political wrangling.  

Our first game was rather noisy and surprisingly full of verbal interaction, and almost devoid of stodgy and off-putting "leave me alone, I am concentrating" moments.

My reaction on my first play was decidedly mixed, despite the fact that others in my group really like this.  There are certainly cool and unique mechanics here, but I found the random elements (mainly the card draws) to be frustrating -- if you consistently draw low gold, you can't ever get as many cards as others.  I'd rather see the resource element be fixed/equalized in a game of this length/weight.   Basically I had the same reaction that I had to the cards in Brass, but it was more strongly a negative to me in this game.

One of the coolest games I've ever played that I don't really want to play again. The game mechanics aren't difficult at all but trying to wrap your head around how the ministries are going to resolve is quite a huge headache. It's too long for my tastes and while fun and am glad I played it once. I don't think I'm too interested in it going through this one again.

At heart, mechanically, this is a pretty basic design where you spend action points to compete in racing and majority mini-games; there are also voting-like aspects including essentially a complete implementation of STV (to finish off majority area control games) and a game where two players compete for votes and voting is with money.

The chief gimmick is the ability to give gifts to other players and thereby obligate them to act positively (or not act negatively) towards you in certain ways, until they return to you a better gift, or assist you in some other, qualitatively different fashion. For instance, you can obligate them to "vote" in your favor, or stop them from continuing to compete against you for area majority (if they're at least as strong as you there).

This is an interesting idea but raises the question in my mind of whether/why it makes sense to give gifts. There is a real opportunity cost to giving them. If you're trying to thwart someone who's "ahead" of you in some sense, is it really preferable to give them a gift rather than spend the same resources trying to compete? Or maybe gifts are something to be used more tactically? It seems to me that if throwing such obstacles at (let's say) the "leader" is generally more effective than competing with him more traditionally, then there's probably a lot of bashing the leader.

A couple of other interesting ideas. Money is drawn randomly from a deck, with varying values; but cards with fewer coins depicted also have more "licenses" depicted, which are needed for one of the mini-games.

There's a foreign conquest game that is not just a racing/majority game among the players but also against the game, as they must be completed before the game clock reaches certain checkpoints.

The game does not seem very exciting. Even if you can occasionally do something tactically brilliant (using gifts or something) the game is packed with so much dull procedure (numerous steps to make uninteresting progress) that I'm not sure the exciting bits would stand out.

The manual is good and it's not a hard game to learn.

The gift giving mechanic is extremely interesting and really makes this game, without which I think it would be a pretty mediocre Euro. Particularly troublesome is the random money, which is fine in the early game but can have a huge influence in the end when licenses become much less valuable than coins. Often a difference of one or two coins has the potential to swing the game.

Played the game twice, with 3 and 5 players. Great game, but too much complexity at 5 players, to little gifts at 3. Maybe 4 players is the sweet spot, still have to check that.

Enjoyed my very first play of this game. I found it to be smoother than Princes of Machu Picchu. I know these games aren't comparable but I played this game after Princes of Macchu Picchu. In fact, I liked the tempo and pace of this game so much that I bought it even though there were a few rules bungles.

El juego está bien, aunque lo único que sorprende es el tema de los regalos, que es interesante, pero que no es para tanto. El final del juego es un horror ya que un jugador ajeno a la lucha por la victoria puede decidir el ganador.

The rules and board are overwrought, but that aside Confucius is an interesting and quite unique game. I think 4 players will be the sweet spot for this one. The central mechanic of the game is giving gifts- if you give someone a gift that person cannot overtake you in certain areas and is even obligated to help you in others. There are, however, certain ways to get rid of gifts, including giving back a higher gift! Without this mechanic, there wouldn't be much game here. It works well though, and so the game manages to stay in my collection as an occasional unique gaming experience. UPDATE: traded it away- no one else in my group likes it, and personally although I really like some of the ideas at work here as a game it doesn't play out in a fun or interesting way.

This is a weird game with a mechanism I've never seen before.  Basically, you can give gifts to other players in the game, which in turn makes them indebted to you, which is useful for holding your majorities in certain areas of the board, and in the voting for those areas.  It's a tricky mechanism that allows you to control the votes, but it's difficult (for me, at least) to wrap your head around the way that the gifts will influence the voting process when it comes time to finally resolve the votes.  There are other ways to manipulate the majorities before the voting, even if you're indebted to someone else, so it's hard to lock down a particular region without a lot of extensive work on the front end.  It's very intriguing, and challenging, and I like it, though it's probably not for everyone.

My only complaint so far is the deck of action cards which players earn by pursuing other objectives in the game.  They serve as incentive to pursue those objectives, but the cards are extremely powerful, and can destroy a lot of that extensive work on the front end that I mentioned, just with the use of that one card.  I understand why they're in the game, but it's very frustrating to see a lot of work get destroyed just because someone drew the card that could do it.  I'd be curious to try the game without them to see how much impact it would have on the rest of the game.

A middleweight game that feels like a heavyweight.  The game could have used a bit more development.  While the mechanics are interesting and the game works well, the complexity and brain damage don't match up with the payout from the game.  It's not a bad game, but there are too many fiddly, complex things going on in what is ultimately not that deep a game.  Plus, we all seemed to spend 40 - 50% of our time getting money.  It seems like there should have been a cleaner way to get it.

After 1 Play: The gift giving is a very neat mechanic, and the only thing that might convince me to try this again.  My biggest complaint is the lack of scoring opportunities outside of the area control section.  There are only a few points available, and it is all too easy for someone to drastically change the outcome with an action card right before a region scores.

The family really enjoys this silly, and simple game.  The nano bug just runs all over and you either have to get it into someone else's kitchen and knock them out, or get it into your own kitchen to trap it!  We played where we tried to trap it.  The game plays super quick, the biggest time suck is just setting up the board, which doesn't even take that long either.  The kids can do it and they enjoy it.  A game we can let the kids play by themselves, and one I don;t mind playing for half an hour, here or there.

RATING: 8
Mechanic is NOT dice rolling! 
Category is NOT dexterity!


It's a children's game, but sometimes we find ourselves playing it, once the kids are in bed! ;)

A very fast paced game, no time to get bored. While there is a significant luck factor, thinking "ahead" and "around the corner" pays of in this game: predicting the most likely path of the cockroach in a labyrinth that is rapidly tweaked by the players does require some brain power from a 5 year old.

It is an action game, with quick thinking being required, but dexterity is NOT required at all! 

There is a dice roll that limits the player's possible actions somewhat, but the primary function of the required dice roll is to delay the player's action on the board, to slow down the pace of the game. The actual outcome of the dice is fairly minor.

However, my daughter often becomes 'mesmerised' just watching the bug run, forgetting to make her move as quickly as possible (as this may lead to an advantage).

+ the required battery for the bug is from a fairly common type, the game comes with a spare battery and thus far our bug is still running rapidly with its first battery

+ appears sturdy enough for unsupervised childrens play

Basically a gimmick dice rolling game.  Depending on what you roll on the dice you may alter the spoon, fork, or knife.  The goal is to have the battery powered bug fall into your trap by manipulating the board maze through the dice rolls.

This is actually my daughters game, but it really is great fun to play. The basic premise is that there is a cockroach in the kitchen and you need to get it to eat your food. A maze of movable cutlery helps to guide it around the board towards its goal and you roll a dice to determine which piece of cutlery you will be moving next. The use of a Hexbug Nanobot is fantastic as the cockroach.

Hilarious game, all ages enjoy it!  How many other games can you think of come with a HEXBUG nano!

See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1904713

[b]VARIATIONS[/b]:

● [b]Variable set-ups:[/b] (official) The rules give four different options for how you can set up the game.  

● [b]Reverse variant:[/b] (official) Instead of trying to get the bug into your trap, you must try to keep the bug out of your trap.   You get a bug token whenever the bug ends up in your trap, and the first to get five bug tokens is the loser.  

● [b]Multiple bugs variant:[/b] Get some extra nanobugs and add them to the game for even more chaos and fun!

● [b]Dice-less variant:[/b]  Since the die has three wild sides, some have suggested a [thread=1045298]dice-less variant[/thread], in which you eliminate the die altogether.  This can make the game flow more smoothly, and some limitations can ensure that it still works well (e.g. you can't move a wall of the same kind as the previous player).

● [b]Cooperative variant:[/b] Some players have also come up with ideas for a [thread=1772117]cooperative set-up[/thread], as another challenge.

Yes, I'll say it out loud: This should replace Looping Louie as the go-to silly game. Wait, let me repeat that louder — Go home, Louie! "UNLEASH THE COCKROACH!..."

More seriously, the game is as noisy as Louie, given how the Hexbug buzzes incessantly into the plastic walls, and it requires players to be good sports about passing the die to the next player, as well as about respecting a reasonable amount of time to choose which fork/knife/spoon to rotate.

Louie is annoying at three and not so great at two players, but this plays reasonably well at all counts. Whereas Louie is fairly brainless, this rewards quick spatial thinking, all while depending on the random movement of a rather convincing electronic bug.

So, ok, the two games are nothing like each other. Louie is a nifty gadget of a dexterity game, and this one is a speed-spatial game with engaging bits. I just prefer the latter by far to the former, based on my actual gaming experiences with both.

You try to make the battery-powered cockroach reach your corner of the maze by turning barriers (forks, spoons and knives), but it often changes direction more or less randomly. Also, half of the faces on the die, which determines what kind of barrier you must turn, are jokers. So, the game is very luck-driven and never rises above some mindless fun for children until the novelty wears off.

As real-time kids' games go, you could do worse, but this certainly isn't something I intend to add to my game library. I feel this is more of a novelty throwaway kind of game than anything else. Nevertheless, it can certainly be an amusing experience in moderation. The board is solidly constructed and should be able to stand up to repeat plays of frantic spoon-turning. Using a hex bug like this is gimmicky, but it really does work here. I'd almost categorize this more as a "competitive toy" than an actual game.

Easy game to teach but there's some dexterity involved that kinda makes the game lose it's luster a bit. What I mean is that when the bug gets stuck on a turning piece and this piece happens to be the one you rolled, you pretty much have to move the bug along with the piece and it kinda feels a like a cheater move. All in all the game is great fun with the kids but it's not for the hardcore gamer.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (August 2014)

Bugs in the Kitchen is not a bad game FOR CHILDREN. I know I’m not the intended target for this game and I also don’t have any child yet (soon but not yet) so I’m rating the game accordingly. I think I would rate it higher if I played it with my future progeny (perhaps a 6.0), but for now I don’t want to play the game again. 

The game is gorgeous, but it is very easy, perfect for little children. The cockroach gimmick is great, but there is almost no game here, roll a dice and move an utensil. Lots of uncontrollable luck, but the game is very quick so it doesn’t bother me.  There are other children games that I enjoy a lot (The Magic Labyrinth), thus the rating. I must confess I had some fun playing it but the replay value seem to be very low, even for children. Very novel game.

I already sold my copy of the game after one play.

Current Rating: 4.0

While this might be the first game with a Hexbug that's come to the market, it certainly isn't the best. I look forward to more of these coming hopefully soon.

A big plus to this game is that you can figure out how to play by simply looking at the board and the die that comes with the game. I know no German and didn't want to go through the hassle of translating online and it really doesn't seem like there's anything in the rules you would actually need to know. Roll the die, turn a utensil, hope it goes in your hole!

There's a pesky little bug in the kitchen! And it's not just any bug - it's a HEXBUG® nano®, scuttling around the game board! Quick - can you catch it in the trap? By turning knives, forks and spoons you can direct the bug into the trap. Throw the die to discover which utensils you can turn. Catch the bug in the trap and earn a token - the first player to collect 5 tokens wins the game.

(10/16) 7. I mean...just a box of silly fun.  Young or old, I don't care.  Everyone enjoys this.

(9/17) Drop to 6. Still silly, still super fun.  Maybe just a little too silly to be able to pull out very often, but still great.

Physically, this game is top-notch. The whole thing sits inside the insert, which you never remove. The parts fit together beautifully, and work exactly as they should -- important in this kind of game! The bug is a great idea, and can be a right bastard sometimes.

As a GAME, it's pretty thin. By the third play in a row, my kiddo was ready for something else. Using different layouts between turns helps, and I suspect playing with four might help as well.

When it's fun, it's a lot of fun. We both enjoyed the reverse variant more, trying NOT to acquire the bug. It feels more personal when it veers the "wrong" way, somehow.

Will we play it again? I think so. Probably not all the time, or more than once at a sitting, though.

After playing Bugs in the Kitchen, nothing specifically about it really strikes me as being an element of a children's board game, with the exception of perhaps the Hexbug Nano, which is hardly a toy, as much as a miniature drone that mimics an insect. Instead, this game is really just an intense, involved puzzle game, in which each player is trying to fiddle the "knobs" of the board faster and faster, in an attempt to "coerce" the bug into a certain corner. The die that is rolled every turn in fact does not add superfluous chaos to the game, but instead forces some interesting decisions to be made at potentially some very interesting times. At any rate, this game is a lot of fun, and has frantic, puzzle-y decisions packed into a short period of time.

Decent kids game. Keeps a young child (3-4) amused, and it's mildly amusing to a parent. The problem is the plastic components on the board are shoddily manufactured, so the hexbug can push through some of the walls. Also, the hexbug battery is exhausted after very little time, and who wants to find a hexbug battery?

Playing with two 5-year olds and and a 2-year old, we had a good time...  The 5-year olds completely got it, and the 2-year old loved randomly moving gates on her turn (and sometimes during someone else's turn).

However, it does feel like the thrill may be short lived.  

I think that I will keep this one out of steady circulation so that it makes an impression when it does come out.

Very clever and cool use of a hexbug. Basically the hexbug is in a maze, on your turn you roll the die which tells you what type of wall you can move (spoon, fork or knife). Move a wall and then it's the next person's turn. If the hexbug walks a path to your area of the board you score a point and it's dropped back down into the middle.

Exciting at times but I don't think it has a lot of long-term play value for me. Definitely recommended for kids though.

RATING: 7
This game is ridiculoulsy good fun in the same vein as a Loopin' Louie. 

The board is a 3D affair that stays within the box. In each corner is a trap that has a gate. Each player picks a corner and removes their gate to set the trap. The remainder of the board is made up of plastic utensils of about 10 centimetres and include sppons, knives and forks. 

The star of the show though is the Nanobot, an electronic cockroach that, once turned on, moves its way around the board. 

All those utensils make for a maze that the nanobot will navigate as it hits walls and generally gets directed around the board. The players take their role in the play by rolling the dice and being able to rotate one of the utensils 90 degrees in the hope of opening a path to their trap and having the nanobot fall into it to earn a disc.

First to 5 discs wins. This is a really well designed game and it is as much fun for adults as it is for children.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]This is still a game both of my daughters like to play on occasion. I cooled on it for a while and then realized the battery needed to be changed. Wow what a difference it made, make sure you check your battery (the game comes with an extra). The game really loses a lot if the bug isn't going 100 miles an hour. 

Personally I like it, don't love it but I am happy to play it with my girls. I probably prefer it to Loopin' Louie now that I think about it... I am sure that will be heresy to some. This is also still the best buy for a children's game found at regular retail stores (I think it is sold exclusively through Target).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really enjoy this game, watching the hex bug almost go into your kitchen but then inexplicably turn away is funny. This game also has great production values, everything works smoothly and I really like the art on the board. This game is easily played by my 4 year old daughter and she loves "the bug game".[/i]

In this game the bug is a battery operated NANO bug.
It vibrates and skitters about.
The game board rests in the box with levers attached over the surface of the board.
Each player has a recessed area on their side of the box...these are the kitchens.

The bug is released and players roll dice to allow them to turn certain levers.
The goal is to slow the bug down or capture him in the maze of levers so you can strategically guide it to your opponents kitchen.

There is no doubt that the bug gets onlookers attention, unfortunately so much so that younger players are so mesmerized by the movement that they forget to roll/pass on the die; in some cases canny young players will roll and wait for the bug to move closer to the utensil rolled, a valid tactic but holds up the play. That was one reason I sold the game, the other being the overall feeling of having not much control: sometimes the die roll means you have to move a utensil that doesn't help you, sure the bug may sometimes provide some humour by seemingly wanting to avoid someones trap, other players are messing with the part of the maze in front of your trap, but ultimately you are still at the bugs mercy making success feel hollow, you feel like you are not making skilful plays, rather decisions based on proability.

Also the bug will start to 'tire' and the game loses some off its frantic pace and as a result I'm also becoming less of a fan of electronic stuff in a game design.

For maze type fun I'm considering Monster Falle which may at least reward more skilful plays.

Sort of a frantic, speed dexterity game where you roll a die, turn a utensil on the board, and try to make a maze of utensils coax a vibrating bug into your trap. It's not my usual thing to want to have some technology in my boardgaming, but the nanobug is pretty cool. It's also something I can play with both of my kids (ages 6 and 3 at the time of this writing) and they are still at very different places, developmentally, so anytime we can all gather to do something we enjoy, all to the good.

A very cute kids' game and certainly good for a few laughs for adult gamers. The game board depicts a maze made from movable barriers that can rotate to alter the paths that make up the maze. These barriers are made to resemble "kitchen utensils" such as the fork, spoon and knife. The goal is to get a nanobug/cockroach into your own pantry. The theme is excellent for kids and the nanobug will delight and digust young ones all at once. With older gamers, this game is good in spurts just to kill time before the main entree.

RATING: 5
A rondel game in which the rondel is composed of cards that are paid for and picked up when you land on them.  Mostly those cards are shares in one of four commodities and/or adjustments to their stockmarket prices.  Discarded cards go to one of three piles with different end game market crash effects.  As in any other stockmarket game, selling when a stock is high makes a good deal of sense, though in 1920 you have to keep in mind that each commodity needs a different minimum number of shares in order to score at the end of the game. As ever, the rondel mechanism limits your choices, though in 1920 that limited range don't seem quite interesting enough.  Plus the running around in circles picking up cards does go on a bit too long.

Artwork and production quality are both decent.

Juego de cartas. Económico. De bolsa. Sencillo, pero con algo de chicha... está entretenido. Hay dos tipos de cartas.. unas son de acciones y otras cambian el valor de las acciones.

I love stock market games. Unfortunately this isn't really a stock market game, but rather a stock acquisition game. There's no "buy low, sell high" type action; just acquire stock and try to raise its value to make it worth more at the end of the game.

Even at that, the game could have still been enjoyable, but it just seemed far too easy to get to the cards you want (if there was even anything you wanted; often, you can be left with a bunch of not great choices), as the rondel wasn't limiting enough. Also, the deck contains a mix of cards: some are shares of stock (that you oddly pay a flat fee for, regardless of the current stock price), and others are cards that manipulate the stock prices. It seemed strictly better to just go for stock cards, as the stocks in this game are almost guaranteed to raise throughout the game, being worth far more than the points given for the other card types.

Overall, the game just didn't seem to have anything fun going for it. It seemed like going through the motions, making mostly obvious decisions. That's not to say there weren't any clever ideas; they just didn't come together to form a quality game.

It wasn't bad but I certainly didn't love this game. The rules were a bit tough to parse out but in the end it wasn't overly complicated.

Excellent strategy game. I like the particular rondel mechanic. The right length and tension during the whole game. Components with very good quality (I love the men with hat pawns!). Beautifully illustrated.

Decent stock market game, but the economy is too loose (too easy to get money for actions) and the playing time is too long for what it is. The latter makes the game less tense as it should be, as there's plenty of time to get over "need this many shares to score" limits.

okayish - another stock theme ...
a bit tasteless

Nice one. Easy to get into it and fast to play. Only thing which concerns me, is that is there too easy to get money enough - a bit more tight economy might do things more interesting.

This game was just boring, most times pretty obvious which move you want to do and it felt too easy to score 3 or all stocks. Lasts way too long for what it is.

Not that interesting stock market game. It is definitely over-rated.

RATING: 6
Decent stock-market filler-plus in an already overcrowded stock-market pool.  Its new take on rondel mechanics makes it interesting; its cruelty (endgame penalty, sabotaging others w/ market crashes) keeps players invested throughout the game.

Fast and semi chaotic stock card game.  Has some interesting twists and turns and can be a fairly tactical affair moving around the rondel.

First play: 4 players game. We all enjoyed it, first turn are quite predictable, but after a while you will start messing up with others players. Capital is very important, but it's not enough if you don't have money to spend for using other players spaces of changing the direction of the movement. To have money you have to sell your very hard to earn stock cards, so at the beginning is so important to have plenty of them and so it become very important not let other player easily get them.

In our play, near the end, the ending condition of the discarding cards became very important, the difference between winning and losing.

Probably more interesting with high player count (4, I'd like to try with 5).

RATING: 8.5
Very good game, reminds me of Hab and gut, but with polished mechanics. The game plays smooth and it's easy to teach, therefore it's ideal to introduce newcomers to board games. For the price it's a bargain, very good components.

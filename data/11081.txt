A card game based in non medelian genetics! Interesting game play based in secret objectives. Ugly artwork.

RATING: 7
It's light.  It's cute.  Luck of the draw can play a big role, but it's short enough that if you're in pain, it doesn't last long.  We find it most fun if you try to give names to each of the character cards.  If only the scoring track were just a touch larger...

RATING: 4.5
A simple hand management card game with some minor deduction elements. Unique theme and weird artwork. The game is easy to teach and play but it is very random and it doesnt give many options to the players. The idea behind this game is very promising and interesting but the game is a letdown. Maybe a homerule could change things.

Such a fun game. You get a secret "trait" in the beginning of the game (nose, mouth, etc.) and you are trying to play cards to have couples pass on your trait to the next generation. You score more points for your trait getting passed on to later generations. In our games, it is usually obvious early on who has what trait, but it is still a blast to play. Another good intro game to get people into the hobby.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Sometimes a potentially brilliant game can be let down by one mechanism that just can't keep up with the way the others interact, and here it is the luck of the draw that ruins an otherwise great game.

The idea is superb. Players are dealt a (unique) secret genetic trait that they need to preserve throughout a royal family tree, as the player whose trait is most prominent in the final family tree wins the game, with increasing values attributed to traits if they occur in later generations.

With only a five unique genetic characteristics and simple blood line rules (all 3 traits on the sibling card - which can be multiple instances of the same trait - need to be present in the 6 (2x3) genetic traits supplied by one couple in the generational layer above), players slowly create a royal family tree across 5 generational branches. Each turn, players either place a sibling (which triggers a score adjustment for the traits but no forced redraw - although an additional hand card can be exchanged for a new card from the draw pile), place a partner on a sibling (and redraw), or pass (and redraw only, increasing their hand size). When a sibling is placed, each of the traits on the sibling card move that trait up the score track by as many points as the generational branch it is in. Over time it will become clearer what trait a player is trying to push to the front, but as long as it it yours at the end of the game, no-one can beat you. At least one trait is unassigned, so finishing second can be enough to snatch the game, although this is unlikely.

Each branch has room for one more sibling than the total amount of siblings in the layer above, and when the 7th sibling has appeared in the last branch, the game ends, and the most skilful genetic manipulator wins.

Unfortunately, it is at the manipulation level that the games comes unstuck: no amount of deft hand-management can beat a system in which the luck of the draw is overbearing. And here, if you don't draw a significant amount of cards with your own trait on it, you are not going to do well, especially in the latter stages, when a lucky card can generate a third of your total score. Even if you get this card dealt early and you work hard to increase your chances to play it in the most valuable generations, there is no guarantee that you can get it out that way. Being able to replace an unusual hand card with a new card from the draw pile when you place a sibling at least means that you can reduce your overall hand size by 1, and still have hope to get a better card to play, but that also applies to the player who is doing well already. Adding (in all likelihood) to that player's score first, in the hope of improving your hand for a next turn, hardly seems to be an ideal way to catch up fast.

Does it make it a failure? Certainly not, what might disappoint the hard-core gamer can be right on the mark for the more casual and less demanding players amongst us, or for parents who enjoy games with their children but prefer something that entertains them too. This appears to be just such a game. Since it is from the maker of Cartagena for a similar audience, maybe that should come as no surprise.

It has been a while since I had the old style pawns in my hand, and I had almost forgotten how often these topple over! Not helped by a fiddly score track on which the score strips are narrower than the markers. People also keep moving the wrong pawn when the purple trait advances. It is a few shades too far removed from the blue pawn provide. Saying that, the overall quality of the components is superb, and visually appealing.

I tend to like games in which player's private objectives are (initially) a bit foggy, but there are far better games in this genre. I know it isn't aimed at people like me, but neither is Cartagena, and that is such a solid family filler that I would happily play it far more often than I should. It is thoroughly entertaining, challenging, and intriguing. Familienbande could have been one of those games too, and Colovini comes so close to hitting the nail on the head again, that my frustration with the complete lack of meaningful hand-management more than doubles my overall disappointment.

My score for this game is creeping up slowly after each play. I am really liking it. It seems a simple enough game with a lot of luck, but one can develop a complicated strategy. In the end, I like the unpredictability and the inevitable "help others while you help yourself" mechanic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Two plays (3-player and 5-player). 

Playing with some open cards to draw from (ala UP, etc.) seems to be the way to go...it gives you enough control to feel that you're actually...well, in control (a bit)! I also think this works fine with five people...yes, I understand that you'll have more "tension" if you aren't sure which traits are in and which are out, but I found it just fine with five!

The art has been popular so far, drawing a lot of humorous comments ("Hey - it's Pete Townsend! or "She looks like she could suck your brain out through your nose if you let her.") 

The scoreboard is truly horrible. I'll have to get something else to keep score....

It's insulting how underrated this game is. Maybe a little too much luck involved, because drawing bad cards can ruin all your plans but, even in that case, you can push your luck and make something waiting for better cards.

Familienbande becomes a great game when played with only 2 players, because there are more room for bluffing and provide more strategical planning. 

Another strongly underrated Colovini game, one more!. This designer deserves better recognition.

I think is a very good theme for playing with women.

Purchased to test it with my lovely Teresa, let's see.

Finally, she likes Familienbande a lot! I'm very happy for that.

This is a kind of racing game, without the control to influence the race much. I felt my opponents helped me more for me than could help myself. And vice versa. The hilariously (intentionally I'd guess) bad graphics suit the gameplay well. 

All luck and almost no meaningful decisions. Not my cup of tea.

RATING: 8
A light and simple enough game to start with, and not without the luck that comes with card drawing, but all the same brilliantly conceived and implemented. It's simply replete with strategic dilemmas. With five generations to play down a family tree and the lower you are the more points you get, there's this real tension between hanging on to you scoring cards to create offspring low down the tree when it's worth much more and creating them higher up for less points or forsooth lamely marrying them off for no points just to help create the necessary parents for those low down generations you want to build. Coupled with really goofy graphics and an impressively compact and portable box this is a great game to carry around and introduce people to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Utter hilarity. The premise of the game is silly and the artwork is so ridiculous that you cannot have a bad time playing this. On top of that, the game is actually a pretty good filler: it's light, it's simple, and it lasts only 15-20 minutes. Bad card draws can be mitigated by playing cleverly to deceive your opponents about your color, and it's possible to trick players into unknowingly helping you. Perfect to play at the end of the night, especially if people are a little tipsy. I've never laughed so hard at someone simply playing a card on their turn.

With 2 players, this plays quickly, and is interesting throughout.  You have to make the best out of the cards you draw, as well as do some planning ahead.  The only thing we don't like is the scoretrack.  It's very difficult to use, mainly because the markers are twice as wide as the spaces.  Additionally, the purple cards are scored with a blue marker.  Otherwise, this is a nice game with an appealing theme.

RATING: 4
Clans light. Or is that Clans with a big wink? Chose a colour / genetic trait blindly, keep it hidden, and then try to score well with that trait by creation of a hilarious family tree using simple and makeshift but  surprisingly functional genetics. The game isn't quite as easy as you'd think at first, but this is offset by the overwhelming luck of the draw which can put you out of the race through no fault of your own. The game's mechanic of keeping your colour hidden works against the obvious house rule of holding a few cards in reserve, and this is quite a shame. I was given this game as a gift when I placed an order through an on-line webstore, so I'm not really complaining, but at the same time I cannot help but feel disappointed. The core idea is marvellous and really deserved a better execution. My advice would be to play the game at the close of a gaming session, or when a lot of alcohol has already been consumed. Otherwise, avoid, as Clans is in all ways imaginable its superior.

[b]Update[/b] It's always wise to visit the game's forums after a long time to see if something interesting came up. A fellow geek proposed, very straightforwardly, that more cards are drawn as to allow players more control over what traits they'd like to see appear. Must give the game a go with this idea; if it works, the rate will very likely go up.

Components: Amusing but rather two-dimensional artwork on sturdy cards with clear iconography.

Experience: A game about hand management that is slightly trickier than it looks, with decisions coming in the form of how best to save cards of my own favored trait until the final rounds, when scoring is highest, and how to marry off undesirable cards.

One of the lighter Colovini games. The scoring feels a bit like Clans, but I really prefer the theme of this one.

We prefer the choice of 3 face-up cards and the draw pile. You have more decisions this way, making the game more challenging. This is better because relying on the draw pile is too much luck; I like light games with lots of luck but just having the draw pile doesn't work well in this game for us. If you don't draw cards w/your trait, there seems to be no point in playing at all.

First played November 13th, 2007. This takes <5min to be taught and <30mins to play for 3 players. There are 5 traits which represent pawns. Each is seceretly one of these pawns at the start. Each card is a male or femaile that has three traits, some with same traits or even all the same. You play for 5 generations. The inital generation is placed down and each player starts with a hand of 4 cards. You have options of drawing a card, marring someone off or giving them a child. To Marry, you simply place an opposite sex card next to them. To place a child, the child must have traits from the parents. Scoring takes place with children. Each trait scores for that color and worth more for later generations. Cards left in your hand at the end of the game are minus points! Winner is player with best score.

Underrated game with great theming, interesting mechanics, and significant appeal to my wife.  It's light, and yet it incorporates hand-management, sacrifice, and psychology.  To me, the only way to play is with a draw pool of three.  This variant increases decision-making, reduces the luck of the draw, adds an additional way to bluff, and speeds the end-game.  My rating reflects play only with that variant.

Well, the basic strategy is clearly "Draw a lot of the cards you need", and I feel that this is not necessarily my strength, but in a game this quick and this amusing (once, I came 5th in a 2-player session), the luck of the draw loses some of its sting.

It works better with special tiles a geekbuddy made, which give you 2 secret traits to play. An interesting synergy develops when 2 players are pushing the same traits.

We play with a variant where 3 cards are showing that can be drawn from instead of just drawing one card from the top to give more opportunity to strategize for later in the game since that is where most of the points get scored.  You seek to promote a certain facial feature through 5 generations which remains secret from everyone else (a la Clans).  On your turn you do 1 of 3 things: play a card to marry a single person on the board and draw another card, play a descendant and don't draw another card, or pass and draw a card.  Be aware that cards left over in your hand when the seventh descendant is played for the fifth generation will result in negative points.  Clever if a bit chaotic game.

RATING: 7
A game of genetics, in which you’re attempting to get your gene inherited as much as possible into the later generations.  There is an interesting balance between the need to establish lineages with your trait and the need to save your genes for scoring in later generations.  The bluff element works well, too.

I like Colovini, I can't deny it. But this is definitely amusing, and not as dry as his usual abstract fare. A nice little diversion for 2 or so players. Luck heavy, but still entertaining. Need to try the variant someone else mentioned of using a card draw pool. Score board is a bit difficult to use. Game appeals to spousal units and girlfriends.

Seriously underrated game.  This is fun game of hidden goals and gradual manipulation.

I need to try it with a house rule where you can draw from a choice of 3 face-up cards instead of just drawing from the deck.  It seems like it would eliminate some of the occasionally substantial luck and not slow things down much.

RATING: 6.5
Beautiful art and simliar to Clans in how players each have a secret colour they're trying to influence.  This game contains both marriage & breeding which I found to be enjoyable.  However, your best bet is to draw the cards that contain your traits so you can play them on the last round (the point multiplier goes up each round).  Since it's a short game I find the lack of control to be acceptable.

A játék elején mindenki húz az 5 tulajdonságból egyet. A játékosok feladata, hogy ezt a tulajdonságot minél több generáción keresztül továbbörökítsék, házasságok és "gyermeknemzés" útján. 
Nagy a szerencsefaktor. Ha nem húzol megfelelő kártyákat, akkor csak nézed, ahogy a többiek "sokasodnak", az általad húzott tulajdonság pedig szép lassan kihal. Ennek ellenére aranyos játék, tetszenek benne a képek az eltúlzott testrészekkel. Azért vannak benne érdekes arcok... ha nem lennének a férfiak és a nők a kártya keretének színével megkülönböztetve, akkor egyes esetekben a fene se tudna megmondani, hogy az illető milyen nemű...

In terms of luck/lightness Familienbande is in the same class as the better known Transamerica. However, as this game succeeds in getting giggles from all players (especially boys 8-12: marry - hihihi, make a child - gigglegiggle) this one deserves a higher score.

Great game with kids or adults..upgraded after further play.

The wife simply loves this game, so it earns extra points from me. The pics are highly amusing and the game itself is random enough to enjoy with non-gamers. This has been hitting the table a lot lately and, in spite of having acquired it late in the year, I expect it to end up number three on my most played games of '06.

Played with three. Seems like you need to balance blocking families from making children that don't pay off for you with the need to be able to play your cards. It is possible to have unplayable cards at the end, so you don't want to make the last couples to heavy in one trait.

Plenty of promise, in the mould of its brother game, Clans. The 'hidden power' and bluff elements are immaculate and the player gradient is excellent, ranging from deduction and screwage in the 2-player game to a desperate scramble for points in the 4-player. An enjoyably daft theme will appeal to all but the stoniest gamer. My only concern is that it is just a fraction too luck-oriented.

Further Thoughts - Immaculate theme and hilarious art are pushing this one on the up. Upgraded to 8.

This is a nice little game of human traits!  (Ears, Lips, Nose, Eyes and Hair) Each player starts with a trait that he must pass on through the generations by weddings and births. Awesome concept and incredibly humorous artwork! You can get stuck being unable to get your trait passed on by luck of the draw and the game is a bit too short for any realistic strategy, but I still enjoy playing this little gem.

You have a hidden character trait, and you play cards to the tableau to ensure that characters hang around that will keep your trait alive for end-game scoring. Not a bad theme, just the game-play was a little staid for it to stay in the rotation as a filler.

By far my favorite Colovini, next best being Corsari.  Good mid-weight filler with positively fabulous card artwork.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a very nice card game. It is about creating a family tree in which you try to play card in a way to create new couples that host the best genes. Each card has a combination of 3 genes so when you got a couple you have a total of 6 genes. These may contain several genes of the same kind or even, since there are only 5 different genes, you'll always have at least one repeted. As you do so, though you might give other players good combinations too. So you will try to make your gene the most represented in the couple, problem here though is that you most likely reveal yourself, since the gene that you represent in secret. If other players know, they might try to screw you. Since cards in your hand at the end of the game count negative points, during the game you always try to play with as few cards as possible, which makes for accordingly few options. So in all this game is very well accomplished considering the size of it. I must say, I was quite surprised as I first played this one. Very nice indeed.

RATING: 5
The theme of this game is nonsensical. Players are creating marriages and offspring between couples in order to produce a desired trait. Why one would do this or who exactly the players are isn’t entirely clear to me. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the game each player is secretly assigned a trait (e.g., noses, eyeglasses, lips, etc). Then players get a handful of cards that represent either males or females that have up to three traits present. For example, I might have a man with nose, hair, glasses, and a woman with glasses, glasses, lips. During a turn, players play these cards to form a family tree, either creating pairing between men and women or, if the traits align properly, making offspring appear in the next generation. Each trait is scored as the game progresses and is worth more points in later generations. 

The game seems to be about bluffing which trait I have while still setting up pairing that will allow me to play high value cards in later generations. It is an interesting concept and one that didn’t have any apparent flaws (other than thematic considerations), but it wasn’t very compelling overall. I would play it again if asked, but Familienbande is not something I’ll seek out.

One play and found it quite boring. As I couldn't find the appropriate cards, most of the time I was just taking cards or had to put out cards that were only good for my opponents as I reached my hand limit. Almost no controll at all.

RATING: 6
A refreshing subject matter (hereditary influence)in which game play matches the theme very well. You try and boost your hidden character trait (as in this authors other design- Clans) and choke the undesirable characteristics via marriages and offspring card plays. The real problem is at game end you lose points for your trait depending the number you  have in your hand.

RATING: 8
While this game isn't terribly deep, it is a lot of fun.  Believe it or not, I think the theme is what does it for me.  There is something to it, manipulating the "gene" lines to get the offspring you want.  The game has it's warts -- among which is that it is hard to make positive plays without sufficient cards with your trait in hand -- but for something that can play in way less than half an hour, I'm willing to overlook them.  I'm looking forward to more plays.

I've played it a couple of more times and the other wart for me is the hidden trait information.  I see why it's necessary, but most of the time I don't know if I'm helping myself or not since other traits are also benefiting.  I guess the key is to balance those other benefits out.  For a short game with a great theme and some decisions - it's a keeper.

RATING: 5
Light card laying game, in which you basically play a gene (for long noses, big ears etc.) and try to be most prevalent in a bunch of (quite incestous) noble families. Of course there is quite some luck involved in drawing the cards. The art is kind of funny but also a bit ugly. Apart from that there is not much interesting about this game.

This card game is quite simple and the luck of the draw is quite important, though you have some decisions to make: you want to keep you best cards for the end, but must ensure that your trait does not disappear since then. But I just love the art of the cards, how the different traits are rendered in the faces, and just for that, I enjoy every game.

Based on one play.  I would rate this a 5, but the theme gives it the extra point.  In the game you try marry off unsightly progeny, make your pretty people part of the young, jet-set crowd, but still have to keep in line with the laws of genetics.  lots of luck, but fun.

RATING: 6.5
15-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. Cute game! In the game you're trying to build 5 generations of a family. Each turn you can play a card as 'marriage' of one of the cards in one of the 5 generations, or have two 'parents' make offspring. Offspring can only be played if the parents share the same traits as their offspring, which are symbolized by icons (hair, ears, lips, glasses). All cards have 3 of these icons in changing configurations, so if you want to play offspring the combined parents must have those same traits.

The fun thing is, that at the start of the game you get a hidden trait that you want to have as much of as possible. I played the game with 2, I think with 4 scores are closer. It now as clear pretty early on who was pushing what trait, but the game was enjoyable!

I love the concept and the way that the game works and comes together is fine, but really there is too much luck of the draw for this game to be taken too seriously.   

I would like for this to have some card drafting mechanism so that you could have some control, esspecially when you get down to the point where you only have a couple (or zero) cards in your hand.  As soon as you get the low hand size there is no planning possible.  What makes this worse is that the point returns start growing at this point, so there is a higher reward for luckier card draws.  

Really, this game is almost great, but the lack of any strategy makes this tough.  What do you do when you only have one sex?  What do you do when you can't play your cards?  What do you do when all you can do is give points to other players and shoot what you've built up in the ass?  Frankly, nothing.  

If I play it again, it will only be if I can choose to draw from three cards layed out face up, otherwise what is the point.  Still though, it is quick so if you are forced to play from the rules, a crap game, is merciful.  Overall, I just wish that this lived up to its potential.

RATING: 6
1st play, 3er, bad ruleset/translation: 4/10
2nd play, 3er, better rules (3 face up cards to draw from, Web of Power style; negative points at end ONLY for cards of your own trait): 6/10 -- much better!

Initial comments:
Interesting game, in theory. In practice, though, it just seemed too random. Your playes are completely limited by the cards in your hand, which are (of course) pretty random. And you can't just draw cards willy-nilly because you are penalized for having too many in hand when the game ends!

Cute game idea, with really ugly art -- these people are scary, and too little control! Like Clans, you'd like to bluff a bit if possible. But unlike Clans, where you can move anything, your plays are limited by your cards. Fortunately, the game is quick. Unfortunately, our first play didn't inspire confidence that it was worth repeating, even though it was quick.

Update: 
It appears we played with incorrectly translated rules. After having a child, you may discard another card and draw a replacement! We'll have to try the game again, and also include the card drawing variant where there are 3 face up cards from which to choose (as well as the draw deck).

--- Summary ---
Each player secretly represents one of 5 attributes (hair, eye glasses, nose, lips, ears) -- like Clans. Players start with 5 cards in hand. Cards show men/women with 3 attributes = various combinations of the 5 (including duplicates). Start with 3 cards in 1st generation. On your turn, either draw a card and pass; play a marriage and draw a replacement card; or play a child: all 3 of child's attributes must come from a marriage in the previous generation -- each attribute earns VP = generation #, and you do NOT draw a replacement card. Max size of generation = 2 + generation#. Once generation is maximum size, remove previous generation's cards from game. Game ends when 5th generation has 7 kids (no marriages allowed in 5th gen); players reveal their trait and earn points according to trait's position on track; lose points for cards in hand (1, 3, 6, 10 progression); most advanced trait wins!

Cute.  Good game to play with my wife.  It's short, light, and you get to go "Ewww!" over pictures of ugly people.  Yes, of course, the winner is heavily determined by chance.  If you don't like that, perhaps you should be playing Go.

Just a nice, simple card game.  True no doubt that if you don't draw the cards you're trying to score in, your goose is cooked... but, well, your goose only cooks for 20 minutes!  The creepy artwork, the pictures of all the different people with these grotesque characteristics, also added to the charm of the game for me.  A pleasant diversion, nicely decorated.  Works fine even for two players.

nice little "secret player factions" game which improves in rank due to theme and ilustrations. as stated in a review here, it's fun to perform "marriages" and "births", and watch the family tree grow. a possible downer is the huge influence of luck; to solve that problem, i've designed a little variant that keeps all of the original feel, while reducing deeply the luck factor - thus bringing the gameplay to a more tactical level. i expect to be posting this variant soon in the files area.

The theme is appealing and the cards are funny. The score track is way too small. But hey, for 2 euro you can't go wrong though ;)

The only game I know that has the word "incest" in its BGG description.

Great cards, funny art, but felt like I had little control on gameplay - just didn't draw any cards with the trait I was going for, so I couldn't further my cause.

My wife and I felt like the game was playing us rather that us playing the game.

Odd game. The mechanics mesh with the theme very well, but there is very little direct control. In our first game, I never received any cards with my scoring icon, so I had very little influence on how the scoring took place, while other players dumped all the cards with my icons very early on. The entire game was based on minimizing how many points I handed away, and never about how many points I could score.

Fillercillo. No es un gran juego, pero te diviertes un ratillo.

A good guess-which-color-the-other-players-are sort of game, and probably one of the best games Leo Colovini has even designed. There is fun to be had here, and not simply mechanics to be explored.

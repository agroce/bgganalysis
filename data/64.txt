RATING: 7
This is maybe the hardest game in my collection to rate.  I've settled on seven, but a 5 would be what it's worth as written with no changes.  With a few of the suggested tweaks it's about the 7 I've given it, but with some slightly more major surgery it could be an 8 or pehaps even (just) an 8.5.

I am reasonably eager to explore the game further with various changes, but I'm not sure that my game group could take it.

What a shame it is when companies mess up what could be a good game by just not developing it enough.  This game is crying out to be Martin-Wallaced.

It's a great looking game with a great theme, too.  So that's something else to build on.

There about a half dozen or so tweaks which can turn this from being a bit half-hearted (and at times irritating) to worthy and replayable.  I've written a review that explains this in more detail here:

For a light war game, well, it's not bad. However, when put in the context of games in general, it is simply average.

Many of the random events could have been incorporated into card play, making for a game with less die rolls and more player choice. Alas, that's not the way things were done back when the game was published.

I can't see the game being any good with three players or less, but the things I dislike won't improve with more than four players, either. A pity, since there are few reasonably short games on this era out there.

I found this game to be horribly broken.  I understand that post published rules errata has been released but as published, this is a terrible game.  The rules are horrendously written for as few as there are.  You'd have to play it to see all the strategies that one can use to break the game.  There are too many for me to list.

RATING: 6
Fantastic production values. Rules feel under-developed. There is a great game in here but the rules need work. For example every faction has these cool historical leaders but it is quite unlikely that they'll be played in a given game. These days I'd prefer to spend my time to play than fixing rules so traded on.

This is a good one to get your teeth into if you like full on conflict, a healthy mix of strategy and random unplanned events and very nice artwork and game components.  If someone gets out in front, the rest smash him!  Much better with 4 than with 5 though; with 5 the last player doesn't have much chance each turn.

Somebody has to give this a 10.  What can I say...I love French designed games (because there is always a chaos element, seemingly).  Sure there are some rule vagueries, but you settle them before the game.  I "pimped up" my copy by mounting the thin counters to plastic tokens.  The rest of the game needed no sprucing up...it's gorgeous.  Have played twice with 4 players and once with five.  No one was dissapointed.  I highly recomend picking this one up while the price is still reasonable.

Decent light wargame with some basic historical feel to it (almost exclusively stemming from the events). The weakest part is the battle system based on a six-sided dice and randomly purchased battle cards, which naturally produces extremely random results. Using a four-sided dice and house rules limiting the number of cards available for purchase each turn markedly improve the game.

RATING: 2
One of the worst games I've played in a while, by far. I can't remember the last time I just wanted to shout "WHY IS THIS GAME SO BORNING?" This game made me want to do it every 30 seconds or so.

The first big problem is the downtime. I lost track of time and space while playing, but I have to assume it's about 4 hours between each of your turns.

There's only one "currency" in the game, spaces, and it's the only thing that matters. It determines VPs, money, and simple board control, so the rich constantly get richer. 

The placement mechanic can easily leave one player just limping along for hours.

The castles are pretty, but why they are limited is a complete mystery to me. 

Have I mentioned this game is long? Holy shit, the "2 hour short game" took at least 5 hours, and we had to call it after turn 6. 

This game is absolutely the worst thing since 1870. And it's worse than that, because there's a clever, if overlong, design under 1870.

RATING: 5
My initial impression of this game was an 8. Subsequent play has reduced my appreciation of it some what. There are three serious flaws in the game, one simply solved and two not. The first problem is the rules for the game are very difficult to follow. The player aids here on the geek help, but they too are occassionally unclear. 

One of the other problems is the red cards. During combat the strength of the forces involved is determined by a set number of yellow cards and one or more different red cards. These red cards are designed to be language independent, which would normally be a positive but these do do not have distinctive iconography such that you can instantly identify them. Rather than a single bold figure for the different roles, the cards use small scenes which are not immediately reminiscent of what they represent. For example, the pillage card is a bunch of people on the roads outside of a medieval city some with crates in there hands. There is no obvious burning or killing occuring. The engineer card has two men who appear to be talking standing on a road outside a walled city with a siege engine in front of the gate , (which is the same color as a gate)appear to be talking. Moreover while there are seven different types of red cards (counting the six heroes as a single type) only three are used in combat (Hero, Engineer, Traitor). Two may be used after combat (Sign of God, Ambassador) and two have general effects which can be used at any time (Ambassador, Pillage).

The last problem is randomness. Foreign intervention is a random roll. Events are a random roll. The cards are random. You can purchase more cards but you are only purchasing additional random draws. Combat is determined by cards played plus more randomness in the form of a dice roll. The effect of the ambassador card is determined randomly. And, most annoyingly, turn order is determined randomly each turn with the only caveat that the same player cannot be first player two turns in a roll. Player decision is less than half of what occurrs in the game, chiefly which cities to attack and which cards to include in the attack.

POSITIVES

Interesting period in history.

Attractive maps.

It holds up to six players.

It doesn't take too long and you can shorten the game.

I tend to like strategic multiplayer military games.

NEGATIVES

Ganging up on the leader seems to be an attractive option in this game. Once you have been attacked heavily perhaps by more than one enemy and run out of cards you are pretty defenceless. This means that when you lose you get slaughtered. 

You cannot get knocked out. Being knocked out could be a blessing because once you have been decimated you are effectively out of the running. People who had been beaten heavily ended up voting for peace to try to end the game quickly because they had little to play for.

Attack seems easier than defence. A player with lots of cards can steamroller his way through an opponent. Fortifications seem to be attractive targets and don't offer that much defensive value so they tend to be placed away from front lines. This seems at odds with a game that is supposed to reflect siege warfare.

The order of play is important but it is randomly determined.

CONCLUSION

I have given this game a low rating because I don't like it in it's current form. If the rules could be reworked to boost fortifications I think the game would be better.

Description: A simple war game set in the era of Joan of Arc. 

Pro: Unique combat mechanic, combining cards with dice. Players can build fortifications, but there is no way to build up troops. Balanced map. Nice art.

Con: Random events can seriously hurt a player. Bad card draws or dice rolls can make it impossible for a player to win.

It's got some good ideas in it but alot of rough edges.  A player who is marginalized early is never a contender.  There probably needs to some system of escalating victory points but generally, the rich get richer (ala A&A).  I'm not sure it's worth house ruling but I would have done so extensively 20 years ago.

It's a good Dudes on a Map game with a streamlined approach.  The absence of armies on the board and using cards instead works better than I would have expected.

On the plus side, there's some interesting mechanics and I really like "mini-wargames".  There's some interesting balances to try to keep some players from racing too far ahead.


The downside? Well...the rules are a little confusing in areas.  And other parts of the game just feel rough.  And length of the game is very unpredictable.  And I don't think there's really any way for a weak player to take the top, but they could probably pull a strong player down.

I've only played once and we decided to end a bit early. (We roll the dice for the first turn it could end in the short version, look at it turning up we needed to continue to play.  Everyone looked and agreed we wished the roll had said it ended.


Wouldn't mind giving this another try when I had more time.   I think some streamlining of the game might have helped.  There's possible "mini-battles" where players have to dedicate attack cards.  On one hand this is interesting because there's some strategy on what you want to risk losing in exchange for a modest reward.   On the other hand, your cards at that point are pretty random, making it feel like an exercise in frustration.

Rather traditional wargame, known also as Montjoie! and set in the 100 years war. Luck in the cards and dice. Fluid. Requires to attack the leader to avoid him/her running away. Potential for kingmaking. Short game (6 or 7 turns) is OK. No need to play the long game (8, 9 or 10 turns).

RATING: 5.5
Joan of Arc runs a bit long for what it is -- the epic feel builds over the first several turns, and usually comes to a head by around Turn 6 or 7. Turns 8 through 10 tend to bog down in calculation as the end draws near.  Strong "Kingmaker" problems, but then, it's a multiplayer war-themed game, so perhaps that's to be expected.  Also, numerous production flaws (some glaring ones, like not including the rules for one of the Events in the rulebook, and not indicating on the "Joan of Arc" card in any way how it is different from the other leader cards!!) really stood out to me as a lackluster effort on Tilsit's part. It was fun, but would take some convincing to get me to play it again.  I feel like the itch is better scratched by some other games (Vinci, Struggle of Empires, Fire and Axe, Mare Nostrum) in different ways. So my rating's kind of like a 4 ("It doesn't get me but could be talked into it on occasion") mixed with a 6 ("OK game, some fun or challenge at least").

"King of England, render account to the King of Heaven of your royal blood. Return the keys of all the good cities which you have seized, to the Maid." ~ Joan of Arc in a letter to King of England dated 22 March, 1429. 

Who doesn't want a game on a female who is a Catholic, a Saint, a charismatic leader, a patriot and loyalist?  Very few games were made on the subject and even fewer were they good.  Excellent production from the French.  Hundred Years War in focus with heroism, natural disasters, political alliance all packaged in one single box.  Deep strategy game with easy machanics, mounted mapboard (!) and a fluid system. 

"I say to you in God's name, go home to your own country; if you do not do so, beware of the Maid, and of the damages you will suffer."

Joan of Arc does a great job of combining the feel of Diplomacy, Kingmaker and Samurai and Katana. It is a "light" wargame with a German boardgame feel. Joan always elicits constant discussion in our group during play, including lots and lots of kibitzing and diplomacy. The game system is well done, the components are thick cardboard pieces and the board is sturdy. The cards -- used for combat -- are beautifully illustrated and oversized (a pet peeve of mine are those silly, tiny cards that seem to be coming out in many games nowadays).

Pretty good game.  There is quite a bit of luck in the draw, and it may be hard to bring back a leader who is content to play defense.  The foreign powers are too weak to be much of a threat.  We had a tense game with lots of back-and-forth reversals of fortune.  The next game (10 years later!) with five players also fun, but took some time.  Nice, simple wargame.

This is an excellent game of knowing when to risk everything and when to play conservative.  It's all in the cards.  One necessary change is to be allowed to use your leader on any ONE turn of your choice; otherwise they almost never get into the game (especially at any useful time). The only way to gain on the leader(s) is to attack them, weak factions feeding on themselves only perpetuate the disparity in scoring. A weak player can destroy the play balance. Game has lost a point for being just too long, it would work as well at 6 turns as it does at 10. The significant luck factor and the strong potential for kingmaking has dropped this game (that I really want to love) down to a 6. Bumped up to a 7 for 4 players.

Update: A critical rule to rein in the leader is the exchange of towns so everyone can get in on the action.

Note: Everyone except the leader wants WAR!

RATING: 6
I am always a sucker for historical themes. Jeanne d'Arc certainly fits the bill. Very much liked the bits - with heraldry of the different factions.
The game seems is area control with a good number of random factors to manager. 
There are several interesting "hooks" using cards to determine the strengths for the "battles". Voting for peace (1 attack allowed) or war (unlimited attacks). 
The translated rules are awkwardly worded so expect to say huh? in your first play. After getting used to the sequence it is relatively simple and seems to work well. 

Moving later in a round seems to be a benefit (especially later in the game) so I may explore the bidding variant for turn order. Also when using less than 6 players I would consider putting out all 6 factions and treating the unplayed factions like the foreign invaders.

I own this game but have yet to actually play it. I have read the rules and set the game up, with all the pieces and everything. And this really is a Waro, through and through. Pieces are of decent quality, with really nice cards and actual stone-like pieces for stongholds and castles. Map seems accurate enough, with a busy but fuctional playing area. I would like to play it, as it seems like good times, but never have the chance. If anyone has played it, maybe you could give some input on the meshing of the mechanics and such.

Apart from Joan of Arc unlikely to have an impact on the game, especially in her inimitable way, a fine light multiplayer wargame. 

The diplomatic rules are vague, presenting some limits (or no limits) depending on how you read them, but otherwise the rules were clear to us.  

I might tinker with some things--like the maximum cards someone can buy/have in their hand, the income generated by fortresses, and the lack of color and prominence in each faction's heroes, but still a fine general abstract look at the time with lots of fun events and chances for war and diplomacy.

Je n'ai pas spécialement envie de disserter encore longtemps sur ce jeu qui m'a déjà valu de nombreuses heures d'ennui.

Plein de mécanismes, des cartes (des nulles et des surpuissantes), des dés, des évènements et un ordre de jeu aléatoires… Plus l'humeur du voisin qui décidera ou non de te taper dessus. Au final, on a à peu près autant de prise sur le jeu que sur un film, mais sans les scènes d'action. Tout ça n'est pas plus profond que le Risk, et réussit même à être encore plus long. Et tout comme le Risk, le gagnant sera celui qui aura le moins subi les foudres de ses adversaires. Un énième jeu de diplo donc, sans le sel des ordres simultanés du Grand Ancêtre Diplomacy… Tout ça pour ça…

Le pire, c'est que l'emballage et le thème sont accrocheurs. Du coup, non seulement on tombe de plus haut, mais en plus on me le réclame encore…

I like the fact that even if you manage to get lots of money, you can't just spend it all and wipe the other factions. You're limited to buy extra 6 cards(no more), 1 Castle and 1 Fortification if any is left, and if you're lucky you can get 3 mercenaries  if not 1 or 2.

Good game with the rule fixes. Rating may go up after more experience with it.

Best part of the game: I'm using the towers to pimp out Castle Panic...

RATING: 4
Fun, light euro wargame that is easy to teach and quick to play (~5 hrs). However, too much luck involved in the card draws and the Hero card is almost impossible to get out. Needs better written rules. A reprint maybe with wooden bits?

After first play, may go up. Rather complicated rules, easy to play wrong (as we did, I think), player aids really required, but not provided.

RATING: 7
Decent multi player light wargame/euro mix with more players improving the game rather than using the non player sides.  Fantastic pieces for the castles, cards and map artwork also good.  Rules need a bit of study and a bit of reading up on FAQ is required.  Lots of bash the leader fun.

Perhaps I'm biased.  I'm a sucker for games of conquest, and I'm particularly a sucker for the Hundred Years War theme, having a particular interest in that history.  Add to that a beautifully produced game (with resin cast castles!!), and I just have to give this game top marks.  Okay, the title is unfortunate (how does Joan consistently get more attention in this war than characters such as Edward III or Henry V?  It's because she's a little teenage pop-star, isn't it?), and the game play may be overly simplistic and perhaps a little on the random side for most hardcore ATers, but the simplicity and the fast pace of the game only help to endear it to me.  I also rather enjoy the combat system, which is an interesting mix of luck and card management.  Just don't be unlucky enough to be near the end of the turn order for the first couple of turns of a 6-player game...  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

I think this game is if not broken, at least flawed. Too luck-dependant.

Rather simple game (not really wargame) on the hundred's year war, with nice map and simply gorgeous components.
Really playable.

Interesting rules and innovative design, but the way the Leaders of the period are depicted is clumsy...

This game plays pretty good. There's some good tactics to be used & the pieces & theme are pretty cool.

A great game that if you tweak the rules you will uncover a gem. Excellent components.

This game had some great stuff that I'd like to go back and fix. If you haven't tried it, give it a chance.

Beautiful components, nice theme and I love the era.  It really needs at least four players to keep everyone busy.

Awesome artwork and particularly appealing game pieces. Pewter castles and fortresses as well as a beautiful board give this game a very appealing feel.

Took us about 4 hours and we only had one or two "War" turns (which dragged indefinitely). There was some fun, but the Fun/Time Invested ratio wasn't very good. I would much rather play A Game of Thrones instead.

Thought about auctioning. Decent game, but not good enough to get it off the shelf almost ever. Sold at EG auction for min bid.

Played several times.  My feeling is it is a game that you must enjoy playing as much as winning since there is considerable 'luck of the draw' at stake.  For this reason I call it a Light Medium weight.  Not to be taken too seriously.

Not a bad game. Rules are not always well organized and it relies too much on the cards you randomly receive. Don't play it with less than five players.

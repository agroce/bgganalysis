Played this at TrashFest 2011, forgot about it though!  Was a really fun game and reading Josiah's comment makes me want to pick it up. 

Still really like this game, and looking forward to the expansion. I think the capital being worth a full 5 points can be anti-climactic--try making it worth 3 points, but mandatory to win.

Conquer the puny humans - Solo, Co-op, or competively. I really enjoy this one.

50's B-Movie monster menace game of global domination. It can really be a lot of fun, or a terrible drag depending on the luck of the draw. Getting stuck in an area with no humans to conquer can be a pain in the rear. Other than that, it is a great game with great artwork and theme.

So much fun. Love the theme and how well the cards and mechanics work together to reinforce the theme. consistently surprised by how much fun I have playing. and in all 3 game modes! currently my favorite flying frog. I feel this really deserves more attention then it gets.

Another game I learnt to love whlie playing it with my son. It has Aliens - which is important for him -, cards that have to be unveiled (in this game it is for locations and abilities and nasties against other players), it is easy to learn and thru the cards and the variable number of players / co-op or player vs. player it has enough variability to see the table often.

It's a Flying Frog game, so it's fiddly, has lots of rule exceptions and a gazillion cards and tokens. And it looks very good, with quality components. The theme is OK (it doesn't seduce nor repulse me), but there is love in this game. Humor is everywhere (gotta love those Teleportation Pants!) and the Alien races are really well designed (they all play very differently, and have great flavor). The system is OK (similar in many ways to A Touch of Evil), but it is somewhat lacking... maybe with the expansion, the game'll get better.

I may need to play this game more than I have. I don't remember the name of the race specifically, but their is a race that can teleport to destroyed terrain, and they win far too often in my games. I have heard people say that the game is better in co op but to me the theme of aliens warring to see who conquers earth first is far more engaging.

Really fun game that plays in less than an hour. Luck is an important factor of the game, but there's a lot of ways to mitigate it. 

The game plays solo really well, and is incredibly nice for all "old science fiction fans". The components are gorgeous, and there's a good variety in the box. I usually play 2 aliens, that allows more flexibility and less sensitive to bad luck, while not too fiddly.

Love the miniatures, artwork, and theme. Not a bad game in general, just not great. Had a terrible problem with the boards warping and becoming very shallow bowls. Got a second copy to replace my first one after the boards warped significantly after a few months. This one seems to have avoided the warping issue.

RATING: 4
This has to be the only Flying Frog game that we've played that didn't feel thematic. And it should. So many cool alien races and powers. Even some nicely designed miniatures. But it never felt like were doing anything but flipping a card and reacting to that. Granted a lot of FF's games have that nature to them. But the events were lack luster and as a whole the mechanics never felt like they were tied to the theme, whereas in say Fortune & Glory all the game mechanics tie intrinsically into the theme. And while I know we are in the minority, we really like the photographic style of their other games. So that they used artwork in this game instead of the photos really made it feel not like  FF game. To boot it isn't even good art.

This game earned the exclusive "Could not wait for this game to end" tag.  Way too many "gotcha" cards that make the game unnecessarily long by deleting hard-won achievements and completely negating turns.

In my experience so far, Flying Frog continues to throw a bunch of art and minis into a box and sell it to people who are looking for a toy.

First play through - very fun, but we played wrong as I'm starting to realize now. 

Though it's our fault too, the instructions don't state one thing ( I think ) that is probably meant to be so 'well duh, of course' that they didn't even bother to devote space to it:

In order to keep track of your score, consult your conquered tokens on the board for the most part. Simply add up the populations to find your terror total. Simply, right, but we debated on various ways from different viewpoints.

Played it once as co-op with 5 players (with expansion bits). I'm not a fan of co-op games but I can appreciate good ones when I play them ... and this is not a good one. Massive random variability (d6 action points a turn?!) and practically nothing to do between your turns makes this a very frustrating and boring experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
A somewhat unique game in your collection, notwithstanding the fact that no single element is notably revolutionary. Flying Frog delivers another high-quality offering here, with excellent components and a fully fleshed-out theme. It's faithfully campy, and the gameplay is understandable and fairly engaging. Options for competitive, cooperative, and solo play are always a welcome edition, and with the obligatory CD soundtrack and solid design, you're quite sure you've gotten your money's worth from Flying Frog, as usual. Makes a great solo game too, offering a complete experience in an hour or less and uses limited table space. On the flip side, there can be numerous rotating global effects which can test your memory with book-keeping considerations, and the soundtrack is not particularly suited to the 1950's alien invasion theme. The overall art and design could have done a better job evoking this particular era, as well.

Co-op
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Definitely the weakest Flying Frog game I've played. That might be because I played a 2 player competitive version, I predict the co-op would be much more fun, but still, kinda disappointed. I felt like I didn't really make any decisions during the game, I just played the cards in my hand whenever I was allowed to, moved my aliens towards the Capitol, and then took over one of the other guys' conquered territories and won. Nice art on the cards, though the board is very boring looking before it gets covered in cards. The alien races didn't feel very distinct. I didn't listen to the CD.

I expect more from Flying Frog.

This is a great game.  I like flying frogs productions games, but most of them feel clunky and do not flow well.  This game feels smoother, shaving off most of the cluck.  I usually play it solo while watching TV after a long day of work.  It requires little though, it is fast paced, and it truly excels with theme.  It is a winner, and I can see this one hitting the table for years to come.

It's not the heaviest of games, and there is a lot of luck involved--both good and bad, but it does a very good job of replicating the 1950's B-Movie feeling it's trying to achieve.

I've only ever played the coop mode of this game and have never felt the need to try it out the competitive mode included in the rules. It's a good and difficult coop that requires people to play well to win, but delivers a moderately fun experience even if it can run a little too long for what it is.

Only played one two player game so far, me vs Danny. Very fun and light game. Start to finish in about an hour and a half and that's for our first game. Like all the campiness. Looking forward to multiplayer games.
     Ok played one more two player game and a three player game now. Pleased with how the game plays with two but it's even better with three (as most games are). Game does slow down a little more though with that extra player. Very fun game!
     Played as a four player game today. Game went about two hours which may be a bit long for a game of this ilk. 3 players is probably the sweet spot for this one. With four players there is almost too much opportunity for screwage from other players. It's very, very hard to get things done in the game which also leads to the extended length in the four player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I've only tried playing this one cooperatively. It's OK, but pretty fiddly. That's almost a bigger drawback in a cooperative game: in a competitive game, you can count on your opponent(s) to point out any rules you forget, but cooperative gamers might just want to let things ride rather than look up an obscure rule.

I enjoyed my first play. Nothing Earth shattering here. Move, check all the modifiers, roll dice. Repeat. Still, the theme is interesting and well implemented, I like the variable races and abilities, and I had fun.  I will definitely see how it plays over time, maybe even with others and not just solo. Decent game, nothing fantastic, but a keeper for now. I do love soundtracks in Flying Frog's games.

Great game to play with my (9 y.o.) son who loves the theme and the combat.  First game was way too fast and easy - second game had better event cards drawn and led to better tactics and battles.
Looking forward to trying the cooperative game since my son likes playing together vs. the enemy.
Extra bump in ratings given because my son enjoys this so much.  I would probably give it a 7.

Component alert:  Boards warp BADLY, dice are chintzy.  I ended up scanning the boards, printing and laminating.  These work well.

Great trashy theme, simple mechanics, mild storytelling opportunities and a hefty dose of pure ol' luck. Great fun. The competitive game mode has a high amount of screwage (to the point that one player might win the game while others get utterly devastated). Cooperative play feels more balanced, even though the challenge level can vary wildly due to the multiple luck-driven mechanics involved (dice, decks of cards etc.).

I really enjoy this game -- great fun, and high variety in replayability -- same powers can give you a very different game from one to the next. I suspect the relative simplicity of the framework and the admitted sometime occurrence of lucky outcomes will keep this game from going above 8 for me -- so I'm giving it an 8, even though I more "9-fully" pick it up and play with glee. Only done competitive version so far -- I'm impressed that it plays co-op, and that it plays solo. Another fun Flying Frog production.

An instant classic in this household; male or female; ages 10 through 43.  

Pure chaos.  Pure fun.  What else is really needed in a game? 

It is my opinion that Conquest of Planet Earth is Flying Frog Production's greatest work.  

Where else can you claim that you won the game by conquering the pitiful human's capitol, then finished them off by eating their tasty kittens?

RATING: 8.8
A very good game. The originality lies in the fact that you have for the first time to conquer the planet earth (you are the alien)and not to defend it against the aliens. The game and the pace is fast. 
 In addition you have multiple game modes: competitive (each players compete for winning), team game (2 players versus 2 other), cooperative (all player fight against a strong human resistance that can be modulated: normal or brutal) and the last option is competitive with an active human resistance, meaning that there is a possibility that no one wins the game (for expert).
 This game is original and easy to play. If you like the movies from the 60's and 70's about alien attacking the planet earth and more recently "Battleship" movie (look at the apocalypse extension for costal resistance), this game is made for you!

[2011-10-27 Rating: n.a. -> 6.5]

My rating and comment is for the cooperative game as I haven't played any other mode:
I guess Conquest of Planet Earth: The Space Alien Game (CoPE) shouldn't be taken too seriously. CoPE is more about the social experience and fun you have while playing it, than it's a hardcore strategy game about conquering the earth. There is quite a lot of luck within this game, so you can't just come up with a masterplan and execute it. 
Nevertheless, I did still enjoy my play of it. It was fun to conquer locations and hope for the right die rolls. I just wouldn't put it on the table if I'm in the mood for something heavier without random events that can and will mess with your carefully laid plans.

This game is so quick and fun!  Gets bonus points for working well solo.  The difficulty of the human Resistance can vary wildly between games - but that doesn't make it any less fun.

Update:  I found replayability to be quite low on this one.  After 15 plays, I sold it.  For such a quick game - a life span of 15 games is not nearly enough.  The expansion was too little too late.

Fun. Thematically immersive, not much setup, plays fast. fun artwork, Definite strategy with a heavy luck component. What more can you want? (answer: playable to 6-8 people and still just as fun, but that's not very realistic).

To me, this is the prototypical Ameritrash game, very random but fun gameplay with dice chucking and a strong actiony theme.

Both the coop and competitive modes work well which is rare and a perk.

RATING: 8
I have read this game can be a bit swingy and it's true. A lot relies on the roll of the dice, and the chit pulls, and the card draws, and your random Alien cards. But... it's really fun. It does it for me. Flying Frog games pulls through again. It's got some interesting theme and real artwork on it. At first glance it seemed it might be a dull game, but when you play it, there's a LOT going on and a LOT to think about every single round. There is a time limiter when playing Cooperative or Solo which is essentially 10 rounds, but can be less than that. This game can be played Player versus Player as well. It's got that 50s science fiction B movie feel and a CD which I've not played in the background yet. It's not impossible to beat. It helps to watch some videos on how to play it, and just jump right in and follow the flow of the player cards.

A fastpaced game with very thematic sci-fi 1950 style artwork. The game has alot of comic and random elements in it. Taken for what it is it's a fun game, however not entirely up my alley. I don't mind playing it again though and it works great with the younger players in our gaming club.

The idea is quite cool fun- a bad Sci-Fi B movie played out onto the board. The problem is that the execution isn’t all that great. 
 Cooperative mode is all we played. Not good enough to play over other games so it had to go.

The competitive game is a near-miss -- the game-breaking cards and janky combat that so contributes to the narrative in the Frog's cooperative games feel cheesy here in a competitive environment (if I play this game again, it will be as a co-op game). Lots of little modifiers but the best strategy seemed to be to move aggressively and roll sixes. Not crazy about the art.

It has a cool theme and miniatures, and I welcome Flying Frog's move from photos to actual artwork. The game, however, suffers from a huge amount of randomness and, in its competitive mode, excessive take-that cards. It's also completely unbalanced. The strength of player races varies from 2 to 4, which is very significant considering how few units you have. There are locations that have a defense of 3 and are worth 1 victory point, and others where these values are reversed. It's clear that the designer wasn't even aiming for balance. The cards are very thematic and I can appreciate that, but the gameplay is sorely lacking.

Conquest of Planet Earth: The Space Alien Game is not nearly as popular as it deserves to be. I think the primary reason is one of marketing. It came out just a few months after another Flying Frog game, Invasion From Outer Space: The Martian Game. Obviously, that's pretty confusing. But where IFOS:TMG was simply a re-theme of the didn't-need-to-be-re-themed classic Last Night on Earth: The Zombie Game, Conquest offers an amazing experience that feels like the designers knew exactly what I like in a game and gave it to me.

You play an alien race bent on the domination of our humble planet. However, there are other alien races as well, each with their own special powers. Only one thing is certain: the humans can't win. So, as in Cosmic Encounter, your alien race has a special set of powers that are different from everyone else. In addition to the special abilities your race affords you, each race also has two stats: strength and intelligence. Intelligence is essentially your size of your hand, which refills at the end of each turn. Strength is the combat value of each of your plastic spaceships. When using your ships to take over objectives or battle other aliens, you will each add up your total strength and each roll a die to be added as well. A roll of 6 is a critical hit (automatic win), so you are never completely outgunned. These races feel very thematic and definitely demand a different play style depending on both your powers and your opponents' powers.

One of the most brilliant mechanics in this game is the action point system. To my knowledge, it is unique; I have never seen it used in any other game. Basically, you have 6 action tokens numbered 2-6 and d6. (So instead of a 1, there is a d6.) Obviously, you want as many actions as possible each turn so... oh wait. Actually, the player who plays the lowest action token gets to go first. Sometimes, that is extremely crucial, and at all times it is useful. But wait, there's more! Each action token has to be used before you can use another one (except the d6 which has no limit on its uses). So once your 6 is used, the best you can do is use a 5. When you have spent your 3,4,5, and 6, all you have left is a 2 and a d6, wouldn't you just use the d6 the rest of the game? Well no, because once you have spent all your action tokens (aside from the d6), you get ALL of them back. So you will need to decide when you plan to take a lousy 2-action turn so that you can get your big action tokens back. The best time to do this? When you want to go first of course! I hope that wasn't terribly confusing because it's a beautiful and intuitive thing in practice.

So many incredibly tough decisions. Should you hang on to a card that is really useful in certain situations, or discard it to draw more cards? Do I use my instant battle winning card this battle, or might there be a time of greater need? How do I manage my action tokens? How many aliens should I commit to each battle, especially since I am also rewarded for spreading out and exploring? How do I spend my action points and tokens?

With two players, it's much more beer-and-pretzels, because it's quicker and there's no ganging up. But with 3 or 4 (4 especially) it really shines, creating some extremely memorable situations that will leave you talking about "that one time" long after the game is over.

Did I mention I'm only talking about the competitive version of the game, but there is a co-op scenario as well? I've never even played it! The competitive game is so good, a true masterpiece of Ameritrash, that when I pull it out of the box, it's all I want to play.

Every single game seems to come down to the wire, with one player making a desperate bid for the final objective they need and other players throwing every card they can at them to stop it from happening. There’s never a “sneaky win”, it’s always hard fought and extremely satisfying. The humans are appropriately pathetic, easily crushed by the alien forces, and the weakest have the keyword SOFT, because they are pink and squishy. Just watch out for Earth’s mightiest hero, Captain Fantastic! I could go on, but I won’t. It may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but if anything I’ve said appeals to you at all, play this one ASAP.

It is pretty lucky, but very quick at the same time (so you don't care) & oozes with theme.

I played a two player game & really liked it, don't know if a 4 player game might become a bit too chaotic..
On a second thought with 4 i would play this only in team-mode  (2vs2) otherwise the usual "leader bashing" would spoil the fun for me & drag the game out.

The cards, races & artwork are hilarious!

Played it with 6 competitive free for all, really bad. Lot's of downtime. Should try teams next time, also have to check out co-operative mode.

Another victory for the company of the Frog. A game set in the 1950 era. You have 10 alien races to choose from to conqueror that crazy planet of earth. Of course earth has all sorts of defenders, from teenagers at lovers point to Captain Fantastic. Nuclear bombs, giant robots, special death rays, tank, planes, heroes, what else can you ask for. A smooth game play, got it. Great cards with cool 50 art work, check. A little bit of math is used for attacks, but a roll of a 6 on the die and you win regardless of the attack, that includes a defenders roll. So theoretically you could have an attack with 20 dies and roll all 5's and a defense of 1. Defender rolls a six and an upset is sickening. I hear an expansion is coming out, save up more money. Easy set, and easy put away. This game can be easily played solo. A top solo game out on the market. Enjoy.

This game is really nice.  The game art is phenomenal, and the cards and pieces are very well constructed.  It is very text extensive, but after a few plays you'll be familiar with the cards and the game will flow a lot smoothly.  It does have co-operative, combative, and a solo options which make play more fun.

RATING: 7
Play the villains, not the heroes, in this early Flying Frog game. Same quality of pieces, equally strong in theme, good enough challenge -- just what you expect. What you don't expect, other than it's illustrated instead of photos, is the lack of competition in a head-to-head game. This is more you against the deck unless you deliberately need to stop someone else from winning. Still worth owning.

PLUS: theme, enjoyable game
MINUS: low interaction, doesn't feel as whole as the later FFP games

Another amazing thematic game from the Frogs.  Same simple, chaotic card-based gameplay you've come to expect, but different enough from LNoE and IFOS to be worth owning.

Rating based on 2 4p competitive plays.  The second game featured a TON of "take that" and skewed way long.  Now that I know hoe to play, I think I will *always* suggest 4p games be either co-op or teams.  4p seems too many for competitive.  

As I get more experience with how the game plays best with 2-4p, I fully expect my rating to raise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
There is no game here, it's all random non-sense. Combat has a die roll modifier (which is fine) but if a six is rolled then that side wins regardless of the strengths. Random cards are flipped up when you find locations, random cards are flipped up when you combat, a d6 tells you how many action points you have each round... it's just unbelievable how random it is.

On top of that there is loads of screw your opponent stuff. Warped poorly made boards and cheap card stock. The art and minis are fantastic though.

A fast paced game of terrifying alien invaders, futile human resistance, and 50's SciFi Movie Action. Players each take on the role of a different alien Race, all part of invading armada, but each with their own unique abilities and ambitions. Unleash waves of flying saucers to blast human resistance into submission with death rays and terrifying weapons of war as you unleash powerful alien technologies on earth (and other alien races if they get in your way). But beware these pitiful humans are not defenseless. They will fight to the last to defend their planet, aided by countless platoons of army soldiers, powerful human heroes, and their most deadly weapon, the dreaded atomic bomb.

I have a mixed feeling about this game.  First, not a bad game.  The game does offer a lot of strategic possibilities when you play one of the alien in a race to control places worthy of 8 VPs.  As each is building up his territories, the other players would use the event cards to sabotage the others plans when one gets closer to the victory. For example, you can nuke your counterpart while he is progressing well.  

There is certainly moment of tension as the game develops.  The system AI, in terms of the resistance cards defending planet earth, is good and competent.  The game is quite clever to implement the AI.  Some tough resistance to crack.  The card art and atmosphere being constructed are quite conducive to the theme of the game.      

Not a particularly good game either.  The cooperative mode is not working as well as the competitive mode.  For a thematic game like this, it is a game without history or something to carry away. Next, who would get satisfied when you are playing the role of aliens, defeating humans and conquest planet earth whereby the aliens rule?  Certainly I am not one of them.

Good, campy fun.  The 50's sci-fi theme is fun and the art work is spot on.  I played this co-op and solo and the experience is challenging and smooth.  The gameplay isn't very deep, but there are always options to tackle a problem.  The alien races differ greatly with unique abilities that challenge players to alter their strategies.  The solo AI is tough and can beat you several ways.

I would be remiss if I didn't single out the components.  These are, without a doubt, the nicest cards I've ever seen in a game.  Almost as thick as a credit card, they're easy to shuffle and pick up off the table and sturdy as a hardcover book.

One of my current top 5 favorites (early to late 2011).

Would like to try the competitive version with a higher VP goal like 10 or 12 Terror Points instead of 8. Game is sometimes too short.

Only played co-op ver once, much better than the competitive game. Very tense game session. Need to try it again soon.

Not as much fun as I'd hoped, nor been led to believe by the reviews. It's not bad, but the conflict game is too long for what it is. Admittedly, in our one play so far, it took us a while to recognise the importance of Space Stuff. Maybe it'll go quicker next time. Not tried the co-op yet.

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  This is a highly thematic co-op game where the player takes the role of aliens trying to take over Earth.  It's got some really nice components with very fun artwork.  It's also a random, dice-chucker at heart, and that style of game just hasn't clicked with me for the most part.  My two plays were fun, but there are a ton of DRMs and dice for resolution mechanisms in the game.  It's tells a great story, but the gameplay just didn't fit in my wheelhouse.

Meh. Has a lot of the usual Flying Frog mechanisms that feel like they're from a game from 30 years ago. The different alien races are cool, and the theme is something I can appreciate. The game just feels like a dice fest though. Seriously...rolling for actions? That's just dumb. I've heard that the cooperative mode is the way to go, but I think if I had any desire to try this again, it seems like the competitive mode might be better due to command chits and a (possibly) shorter playtime. Still think Dark Gothic is Flying Frog's best game, with Last Night on Earth being an honorable mention.

We just keep coming back to this game. Perfect celebration of classic B sci fi alien invasion movies. It's fun to feel like you're the aliens coming in. The componenets and play feel is fun and satisfying. There could be slightly less luck with the die roll for number of action points--but this can be altered. It actually is more fun cooperative like all Flying Frog games we've played so far. Very excited for the expansion because more overall content and types of cards is all this game is lacking.

UPDATE: The expansion is fun, the supplements are good. This game really is solid. I like how fast paced the competitive version is. I disagree with people who say coop is the only way to go. I think it's equally good with both but like all FFG games you should start with just competitive when introducing new people.

A hidden gem! Who wouldn't want to try their hand at being a dangerous and intimidating alien race bent on destroying the human race? All I can say is I generally do not like space themed games and I really enjoy this one. This game came out right about the time that Flying Frog's other Martian game showed up in stores. I almost missed this one. If it hadn't been for Drakenstrike's video review, I might not have known about it. 

The mechanics are fun and well integrated. The components are as usual awesome. The player mats are warping though...a bit annoying. I absolutely love the Space Stuff deck and it's very clever surprises. A tightly balanced game while playing cooperatively...which is a real joy to play btw. We play rarely the competitive way, but I do like it as well.

A cookie-cutter output from Flying Frog: same theme, same art, same component mix, same mechanics as others from their production line. Here you explore a spot by revealing a card which indicates how many fights you have to win to earn the VPs from that spot. Each fight is turning over a card  (the human defense) which could be a value between 0 and 6 or draw-and-add-another, and then dice off. So there's randomness in the cards, randomness in the dice. Additionally you get a hand of 4 event cards, some of which help yourself, others provide a take-that, allowing to whomp on the player who's been luckiest so far. First to 8 VPs wins. Which you can do by just playing on your own board, without having to move into and contest VPs on the middle board against the other players. So it can be solitaire-y. The co-op version is much the same but you total your wins, which ain't that interesting decision-wise. I felt the game was fully explored after one play. While it's fun enough due to theme, each turn is more of the same - cheering for a 6.

RATING: 8
"Swingy, thematic co-op with an awesome theme. I would never play the competitive version. The rules aren't hard, although they have a couple exceptions you have to remember. There are a lot of abilities and bonuses to track, which put me off the first time I played. Five years later, when I tried again, it wasn't so bad. It's (much) less convoluted than Sentinels of the Multiverse, and about on par with PACG Rise of the Runelords. "

What I like:
- LOVE the theme
- Each game plays out like a movie, with some awesome cinematic moments
- Lots of alien races in the box, and each plays quite differently

What I don't like:
- There are a few fiddly rules (2 heroes->event; how resistance counters move and bump)
- Runs long (about 1 hr per player, so far)
- You have to track and remember quite a few bonuses, abilities, and powers
- The card draws, can be quite swingy (even more than the dice)
- Co-op is sort of "roll and move" (but it's not bad)
- There aren't many alien event cards, so you'll cycle through all of them each game

Originally I rated this a 6 after one play. 5 years later, after 3 more plays, it's a low 8. In some ways it reminds me of Vanished Planet, another swingy co-op that is a bit difficult to learn, but where each session plays out like a movie.

I bought this game when I was a bit depressed (I was doing night shifts at the time) for the fun value and was not disappointed. The players take command of aliens set on the conquest of Earth with a variety of special powers, which keep things fresh. In the cooperative game they must defeat the not so puny earthlings against the clock, but in the competitive game they can also attack each other as they fight for control. Not a game with long term strategy as the areas attacked and the forces that defend them are drawn randomly, but definitely good fun.

I'd call it a nice twist on Cosmic Encounter. Races are not as many, but still a decent amount. I love the artwork, and the various types of cards. Miniatures are OK.

Fans of Flying Frog's quality game designs and Production quality will be well satisfied with this game.  One plays an invading race of aliens trying to stamp out humankind. You may be trying to do it with the aid of other aliens, or you may be trying to do it before other aliens beat you to it.  Fans of earlier Flying Frog Games may find this game to have a faster, more urgent pace than earlier game offerings.  It definitely feels like the pressure is ratcheted up.

I played a 3-way game.  One player found nothing but 0-VP locations.  One player rolled 6's for resistance rolls and auto-lost most fights.  The third player found a winning total of VP after three explorations and won before the other player had an opportunity to interfere.  Nobody had fun.

The game was short, but still had too much down time.

The rules are complete, but overly verbose.

The art on the asymmetric alien cards is very thematic, but the mechanics do not invoke a strong sense of theme in me.  Apart from the minis, art, and some card names there is no theme.  The mechanics of the aliens and tech cards don't make me feel like I am an alien invader or invoke situations akin to 1950's sci-fi.  It's just thinly pasted on -- not something I have a problem with when the game is good, but the underlying game is just there to prop up the theme.

So it's a fragile skeleton with a cheap paint job.

06-09-2014. Rated after 1 competative play. Fun game about alien conquest. We played the competative variant, while folks from the DiceTower go on about liking the cooperative version better.. But I guess I'll have to make due with what I have played.

Like all flying frog games I've played, it's a luck-fest. I got killed early on the game when I explored a region on the board. The human resistance just rolled some sort of critical hit wiping me out almost completely. I ended up winning by some cardplay and getting to 8 VPs quickest.

While I think this is one of the better games of FF I played, I enjoyed it at least way better than Fortune and Glory, I do not feel that this game is anything special. Also, the components and board are ugly.

Pure random fun. There's a little bit of tactics, but mostly this game is just random. And if that's what you want, then this game's pretty good. However, even for me this game is a bit too random. Yeah, I know that Flying Frog are not reknowned for their deep tactics - but this game just feels more random than them. There seem to be fewer meaningful decisions - it's far more reactive.

There is also the issue I've seen thus far that, with four skilled players, you're quite likely to have no winner (especially with hard resistance, which is a pity as that adds something to the game).

All in all, I'd give it a miss.

I was really digging this game until it ended abruptly. I liked the concept, the theme (very reminiscent of The Day The Earth Stood Still with all the Washington D.C. locations), and the gameplay, but then I decided to have a gutsy turn so I went after the capitol (which is worth 5VP when the goal to win is 8VP), strung together some good (but not insane) die rolls and won the game. It felt anti-climatic, but the game was fun while it lasted.

The Co-op varitation is, by far, the only reason to play this game.  It's just so much more satisfying to work together against the humans than against eachother.  Plus...now that I've thought like an alien, I will be ready when they arrive.

Least favorite Flying Frog game, but still fun. Biggest problem is that it only supports four players.

RATING: 6
Players each represent an alien species hell-bent on conquering Earth. Each turn you spend 1-6 action points playing event cards, moving your flying saucers around cards representing locations, and rolling dice to conquer them. Different types of location are worth more "terror points" and have different levels of resistance; control eight points' worth at once to win. 

There is a co-operative mode I have not played.

Most of the fun comes from the lavish production -- the components are great, from the illustrations to the fantastic flying saucer miniatures -- and the weird and wonderful event cards and "Space Stuff" items. There's a lot of luck to it but it's amusing enough that, if it fits within the advertised time, it doesn't outstay it's welcome. With timid players or too much bash-the-leader (taking conquered territories from other players is often easier than taking new ones) it can drag on too long. There is also a hated event card that removes all location cards, resetting the board.

VERY fun, light and campy game.  It seems to work best as a cooperative game or competitively with the resistance token rule adds to the gameplay.  There's not a ton of strategy, but it is a good for more than just filler. The theme is great, the artwork perfect, and has nice replayability.  The solo version is fun, but my favorite is the competitive version. 

I wish the resistance counters moved in a more tactical way and that more of the moved.  Also, it would be more realistic if resistance cards that defeat the players weren't discarded.  They should stay to fight another day.  The way it is, someone could fight tanks (strength of 5) and lose in a town, then the next person would fight an angry mob (strength of 1).  Otherwise, lots of fun.

RATING: 7.5
Very decent game, up the rating by one with kids aged 8-11. Currently, the most requested game when my eldest has some friends over. The excited look on the boys faces when they have some body-eating zombie making magic alien race with harvesting drones and a brainsucking device makes all adolescent dreams about world domination come true :D

As a gamer, it is a pretty simple game of bunching up your guys at the good spots, hope the resistance isn't too bad and have some luck with the dice. Not much real strategy, basically mainly mindless MAYHEM and FUN. 

That, it delivers. Targeted towards the less adult/serious audience, and a great game at that.

We played the competitive version of the game. With these new Flying Frog games, I am never sure which version is supposed to be the best version, competitive or cooperative (or team!). This is the conundrum of Flying Frog games for me: they are about more, more, more, rather than carefully chosen less.

Conquest of Planet Earth is fun so long as you are able to take it for what it is, and that is a light, heavily thematic games about trying to rule the world! There is a lot of random events and dice rolls. There is a lot of silly illustrations and plastic models. All in all, it knows what it wants to be and embraces the style. If you enjoyed Last Night on Earth or the Cliffhanger Game, then I suspect you will want to check out Conquest of Planet Earth. I wouldn't want to play any of these game very often, but I manage to have a good time when I do.

This game is just fun. Co-op is by far the better option. It plays fast and is silly enough to feel very light but has enough tough choices to keep it interesting. The artwork is cool and really brings the theme to life. My favorite from Flying Frog so far.

Fully embodies the Ameritrash spectrum: high randomness and luck, lots of theme, and can be played multiple ways (competitive or co-op). It's easy to learn and teach, and every time I've introduced it to people they've loved it.

The downside is that once you've seen all the upgrades and enemy cards, the surprise and excitement wears off a bit. Hopefully an expansion will breathe some variety back into the game.

Played cooperatively this was quite fun. The theme comes through pretty well. There's quite a bit of chaos, but it matches the theme and the array of card options, especially when players share their benefits, helps offset any bad luck. Also, part of the fun can be managing your hand against shifting circumstances (ie, shifting puzzles).

A fast paced game of terrifying alien invaders, futile human resistance, and 50's SciFi Movie Action. Players each take on the role of a different alien Race, all part of invading armada, but each with their own unique abilities and ambitions. Unleash waves of flying saucers to blast human resistance into submission with death rays and terrifying weapons of war as you unleash powerful alien technologies on earth (and other alien races if they get in your way). But beware these pitiful humans are not defenseless. They will fight to the last to defend their planet, aided by countless platoons of army soldiers, powerful human heroes, and their most deadly weapon, the dreaded atomic bomb.

Another colourful and fun game by FFP. Gameplay is fast and simple, atmosphere is great and any insidious action against other players in competitive mode is a good chance for your diabolical laughter.

Great components as usual, the glossy, thick cards in particular are a joy to play with. Great game, quick, light and fun. Enjoyable solo experience too although a lighter / faster game than A Touch of Evil for example so the narrative produced is obviously going to be less. With that in mind I'm assuming much shorter legs on this one.

RATING: N/A
Я пригляделся к этой игре потому что люблю игры тематические. Также в ней ожидались не сложные правила и фан.

И вот опубликованы правила. 

Как ни странно, есть игры в которых прочтение правил дает мало. Это потому, что большая часть информации скрывается не в рулбуке, а например в тексте многочисленных карт.

Из рулбука отмечается что игра очень рандомна и говорить о стратегии (осмысленных действиях) в ней крайне сложно. Например каунтеры сопротивления передвигаются рандомно. Встречные вытягиваются рандомно. Все недобитые сбрасываются, и в следующий раз вытягиваются новые. Сами битвы решаются броском кубика. Изобретения людей (научные прорывы) происходят также броском кубика, в худших традициях науки из Axis&Allies. 

С другой стороны в рулбуке совершенно не приводится какими картами рсполагают игроки и что ими можно делать. Ну нет возможности это оценить, как и какую вообще роль эти карты играют в сравнении с грубой силой (и кубиком). Предположительно сила и разум должны быть равноценны.

Самое удивительное в рулбуке, это как подаются варианты игры. Сперва разъясняется примитивная бродилка-молчилка - это называется Competitive. Затем людишки получают фору, за счет чего правила и игра усложняется и это уже называется Cooperative. А затем и вовсе приводятся варианты вроде "все сложно как в кооперативе, но только каждый сам за себя".

Вобщем механика по впечатлениям - низкосортная. Удивил уже тот факт, что позиции игроков неравноценные - у одной пары игроков двое больше шансов безопасно долететь до центра Земли, чем у другой. Карты возможно добавляют изюму, но это еще не известно. Сама игра должна строится на взаимодействии игроков. Тут и карты явно играются друг против друга, и очки можно выбивать из друга.

С другой стороны в механике замечена парочка интересных идей. Например есть встречные герои, при вытягивании которых тянется еще один, и они комбинируются. Это может создавать интересные вариации. Впрочем фишка в том, что после боя встречные полюбому сбрасываются. Также, не смотря на того что исход сражений сильно зависит от кубика (как в обычной бродилке), перед битвой игроки должны найти наилучшее применение своим Action Points. Хотя всеравно делается это в слепую, т.к. с кем им предстоит сражаться - неизвестно.

---

Ок. По первым отзывам карты действительно дают много. Кроме того, бонусом идет возможность играть соло.

Я возвращаю свой взгляд на эту игру, но остается еще вопрос - насколько она языко-зависима...

RATING: 7
Still very good, fun co-operative game.
Feels a bit like Ghost Stories with added FUN.

The standard competitive variant of the game is a bit flat with little interaction and action at all, and I would only rate this a 6.

However, the "competitive with active resistance" advanced variant described in the back of the rulebook, combines the competitive and co-operative game variants so that the players compete and fight with each other while the game/humans try to kill all of them and the game/humans win after approximately 10 game rounds if no player has won before then. This is much more fun than the standard competitive game - and it is HARD.

Conquest of Planet Earth is another solid entry into the Flying Frog stable. It's certainly not as good as Last Night on Earth (How many games are?), but it still makes for an entertaining evening of human bashing and urban destruction.

The competitive game is the default mode, but I've never been a big fan of games that rely on gotcha cards and leader bashing to provide all of the challenge. It typically just makes the game drag on and usually provides more frustration than fun. I've only played the co-op game, which throws out the infighting and raises the difficulty of the human resistance. It seems like a good trade-off, not to mention co-ops are all the rage around my house anyway...so I don't expect to see the competitive mode anytime soon.

While I think the combat system is a little uninspired (essentially dicing off with a D6), it does keep things moving quickly. Because of this, there is very little down time between turns, which is always a plus. The best thing about Conquest though, is the self referential Flying Frog thread that runs throughout the game. The Last Night on Earth town is featured as a location, as is the circus from Invasion from Outer Space. The aliens from Invasion are also featured as the scouting party on a couple of event cards. One of the alien race's special power is...wait for it...raising the dead! I guess we've figured out what caused the undead plague in Woodinvale!

All of this fanboy flavor really is a treat. If you've enjoyed most of Flying Frog's previous efforts, you'll certainly enjoy this. If you haven't, there is probably nothing here that will change your mind. It's not great, but it's good enough.

Now where is that Golden Age Super Hero game?

Most of the fun in this game is in the ridiculousness of the different alien races and the opportunity to gleefully backstab your friends. Winning the game always feels like a triumph.

Coop mode is distinctly less fufilling since you're playing toward a victory point goal. I prefer Flying Frog's other games if in the mood for something cooperative.

A wacky game in which you nuke your friends, eat kittens, and stomp around the capital with a giant robot.  Absolute mayhem.

A cool feature is that you can play both competitively or cooperatively.  After one of each, I think I like the co-op variant a bit more.  Not only did it feel a bit more strategic, but the insane randomness of it all is just more fun when you're all in it together.

A lot of zany fun if you're into that sort of thing.  I loved it.  But even so, I certainly wouldn't play it every week.

This one just isn't as much fun as Last Night on Earth.  Same idea, but not quite enough game there.

1950's themed sci-fi aliens systematically explore and conquer the pathetic inhabitants of earth. Card driven, action point system for area control of random discovered location cards. Unique competitve turn order system where fast actions go first. Big card combos are possible but the downside is that player turns can be long. Tons of expansions. And, how can you lose with space amazons?

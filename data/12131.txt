150909 Still my favorite trick taking game in theory but I don't know when I'll get another chance to play it!

130929  Its my favorite trick taking game.  The funky deck using dominos makes for an interesting mindfuck and I appreciate the fact that its played with open information. 

110604 national game of texas, played online, would like to try it in person.  Tile games lose a lot when you don't have real tiles in play.

I love this trick taking game.  It's a wonderful game to play at social gatherings.  I definitely prefer playing with the thick tournament style dominoes.

This is a decent game to play, especially with other experienced players. It has enough randomness to to make you think about it, but enough information to quickly make a decision. Much faster than mexican train, but only accommodates 4 players

Aside from being a nice novelty, the dominoes create a nifty shifting-suit mechanism. It's also pretty analytical, counts points in addition to tricks, and has bidding and partnership play. I like all of those things. Play with marks.

I don't like the 84 bid, however. It doesn't take a lot of skill to determine when luck gives you a perfect hand so I don't see why you should be rewarded with two marks. I suppose it could serve as a catch-up mechanism but it can also serve as a runaway leader mechanism so it's a wash on that front.

It's also possible to lose the seven hands in a row through no fault of your own, just you and your partner getting unplayable hand after unplayable hand. Playing to a higher mark count and eliminating the two mark bid would be preferable to the default method.

Update: lowered to a five. I play this a lot on my phone and find myself getting annoyed at how frequently I have to pass. I don't think there's enough variance in the bidding to keep this interesting but the novelty factor is still high.

I became soured on this game when I got paired with a partner who would not pay attention to the bids. My wife, however, learned the art of table talk, which would usually result in defeat for me and the partner. Light fun, otherwise, but prone to too much luck of the draw and and partner collusion.

I'd prefer to play spades over this.  The dominoes provide a little bit of a twist (as each domino comprises 2 suits).  Interesting concept, but doesn't grab me.  Not bad for a game invented in the 1800s though. :)

RATING: 6
Good domino game, but behind Five-Up and Block (Latin American) for me.  A trick taking game more like a card game. Generally, I like to use cards when playing trick taking games, but if all you have is a set of Dominoes, this is a great game to play.

I own a standard set of Double-Six [gameid=2394] to play this game.

My family plays this a lot.  I remember reunions as a kid seeing several tables filled with dominos.  It has been several years since I have played myself.  I think I need to brush up on the rules and get back in the game, so to speak.

Of course, graduating from Texas A&M, it is required to play this game. But it is not required to love it. However, I do. It could be just fond memories of a game that was acceptable to play in a bar, or the wonderful tactile-ness of the bones, or even the fact that it's actually a good game similar to Spades. UPDATE - Wow, haven't played this in ages, but I still loved it. I taught it to my regular group, but I don't think they cared for it as much as I did.

While not an actual board game per se (you only need a set of double-six dominoes to play), I have spent many hours of my life playing this game. I learned this game in college (Texas A&M) and urge anyone who likes spades/etc to learn this game and teach it to someone else.

The National game of Texas!


We had some older folks join our gaming group tonight, and they were not familiar with many of the newer games.  They brought out dominoes and we all chimed up "42"!  After that, they were hooked and we are now their new favorite people!

Mostly a marker for my wife's double-6 set of Aggie dominoes.

RATING: 6
42 drew my interest for its creativity both in game design and in circumventing a religious taboo (i.e., playing cards). It's a nice mix of skill and luck. If I'm going to play with dominoes, I'd gladly choose this among the few other domino games I've played, but I'd prefer a card game.

Coloring the point tiles is helpful. It's not that it's difficult to identify the fives and tens when you're looking for them, but there are other details that distract.

My understanding is that double-high ranking is common among card-like domino games, but it sure seems funky to me. Managing a dual-valued hand is also a bit foreign, but interesting.

I used to play this multiple times every Monday for over a year before I found the Geek, so the plays logged are nowhere near accurate.  Although similar to Spades with the bidding and trick taking, the fact that trump is determined by the highest bidder offers plenty more strategies.  The strategy is also increased because each domino can have two possible suits!

RATING: 8
Wow.  I was surprised to find this here.  I thought it was just a family game since I'd never heard of it anywhere else.  Well, anyway, it's a great trick-taking game somewhat similar to another family favorite Rook.  Of course, the real intriguing part is that it's played with dominoes.  My family also plays with the variations of Nello, No Trump, and Sevens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A favourite game which seems specific to Texas, where I grew up. Played with a standard set of double-6 dominoes, it's actually a sophisticated trick-taking game, not unlike Bridge. The interchangeable nature of numbers/suits adds an additional element of the game -- is the 3/4 a 3 of the fours suit, or a 4 of the threes suit? Depends what was led, what is trump, etc. A great game, whose special variants (nullo, sevens, follow the leader) make for a lot of replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
So this is really a game played with standard double six dominos, but as I love it so much I'm adding it here.

It truly is one of those games that takes a few minutes to learn but every time it's played it's a new experience and there are more intricacies to learn.

One of my all time favorite games.  It takes a little bit to learn how to bid, but has a perfect mix of skill and luck.  The only thing I am not found of is the nil variant.  It can be fairly annoying when your partner likes to go nil a lot since that means you are sitting out that round.

I was in the field with some students and they taught me this domino game which they claim is popular among students at Texas A&M as well as across Texas in general. 42 is basically a very simple trick taking game, wherein the suit of a domino is determined by the higher number on it. The exception is the trump suit, which is called by the winner of the bid. Each round one team will score a point - if the team that won the bid makes their bird, they will score a point and if not, the other team gets the point. First team to three points wins. Other than the novelty of playing with dominoes rather than cards, I’d much rather play Spades, Hearts, or any number of modern trick-taking games.

Two trusted geekbuddies are always going on about 42 - the Texas domino trick-taking game. And they're right, it's damn good! The neat thing is that each domino can be played two ways e.g. the 6/2 is either the 2 of the 6 suit or the 6 of the 2 suit. It's 2v2 partnership too, which I always enjoy.

This is a very interesting combination of dominoes with card-playing mechanics.  I had been interested in giving it a try for a really long time and was quite happy when the opportunity finally presented itself.  I found as interesting as I expected.  While it did take a few minutes to get my head wrapped around it, it was not terribly difficult to pick up the basics.  There were certainly some subtleties available, though nothing exceedingly complex.  I would definitely be interested in giving this one another go at some point in the future.  [07/13/2007]

42 is trick taking game played with dominoes! 
It is a partnership game where teams compete to catch the, you guessed it, 42 points available in each hand. It is like any other trick taking game (only better  ) The higher end of the domino led determines the "suit" for the hand. 

This is an extremely popular game in Texas, especially among Baby Boomers. I have played countless, countless games of this with my Dad, a Boomer, and still can't figure out how he manages to completely destroy all his opponents! I prefer being his partner.

Love this!!!!

You can always find another Aggie in the room by dumping your bones on a table and starting that distinctive sound of dominoes shuffling.

I was born in Texas.  Playing this game is in my blood and has influenced why I rank it so high.  As others have commented it is a great game to introduce to a group of friends that just like to get together and shoot the breeze.  Doesn't take long to learn but has PLENTY of strategy once you learn how to "read" the bones.  The bulk of my playing occured before I joined the geek but I have several hundred games under my belt.

I have played this literally hundreds of times over the years, and it never gets old.  Plays a lot like spades with dominos, with a few twists since there are special dominos worth extra points and a domino can have more than one suit.  Great social game that is challenging but not too heavy.

RATING: 7
Game play is great but I was surprised at the production - value was lower than I had expected.  Played a demo at Gencon and thought it was a prototype only to find out it was the final components.  This game seriously needs some kind of soundtrack or automatic timer system to maintain the pace and tension, and an overall graphic design / art face lift.  Mats are pretty thin as well.  Perhaps it's unfair to compare to the production of Space Alert but that's the kind of production I was expecting.

That said, I really enjoyed the game play - it's unique and fun, full of tension, and must be experienced personally.  VERY cool co-op game idea, though some of them mini games are better and more thematic than others.  When you hit a core breach, however, you are in for a ride like you've never had in gaming.

IF you play it, make sure to get the timer app from Stronghold. It really makes for a more pleasant experience.

Space Cadets is a solid coop game for bigger groups.  The mini games are all simple to play, but it is the interactions between them where the complexity comes in and what makes the game compelling.  Not everyone will like every mini game, but odds are there will be someone in the group willing to play each game.

The game can be a little long for what it is, but the mission structure is flexible enough that you can find a mission of a length that fits your needs.  I definitely recommend the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/84297/official-training-missions]official training missions[/url] available here on the Geek for your first few plays to get down the basics.

The components are fine, though not great.  The player mats are a bit on the flimsy side, but otherwise everything does its job.  I highly recommend the (free) timer app released by the publisher.

All in all, a solid game that I'm happy to own.  It doesn't hit the table often because of the length and number of players required, but when it does, it makes for an enjoyable experience.

It appears to be a very well-designed game, so I'll give it an extra point for that.  Otherwise, it's not something I would normally play.  More complicated and less fun than [b]Space Alert[/b].  I like the idea of mini-games, but you seem to have a very limited amount of control of the ship when you add the pieces together.  It's very hard to make a concerted effort to do pretty much anything.  Not my thing.

I enjoyed this game, and it was better the second time than it was the first. The game has a risk in overstaying it's welcome, but as long as you have a captain who keeps the game moving, it does well.

Bonus points for being one of the best scaling games I own, plays well with 3 or with 8. A serious competitor to Space Alert

RATING: 7
Excelent game, the minigames played by everyone is very different one from another, yet everything is linked through the captain decisions and the result of every minigame played by every specialist work together with a very good flow. Impressive to see how much skill everyone need here, we have a texas hold'en poker game, a memory test game, puzzle, tetris, dice changing, find the correct piece and much more, I enjoyed it so much.

My favorite role is Shields, because it is pattern matching. I think there are too few rounds and the difficulty is too high. In any co-op game, there needs to be highs and lows, like a roller coaster. For this game, it's like going straight into an accident.

Really needs the right kind of people to make this game enjoyable. Lousy written rules, but has great potential. 

Playtested the first expansion wich was quite good. But man this is a fiddly game. Too many ruletweeks that you are bound to forget. Takes too much time for what it is. Setup takes forever. 

Lowering its grade from a 7 to a 6!
Rather play 5 rounds of space alert instead. More fun and less complicated.

Καθαρόαιμο real-time συνεργατικό παιχνίδι όπου οι παίκτες είναι το πλήρωμα ενός διαστημόπλοιου και προσπαθούν να φέρουν εις πέρας μια αποστολή. Βρίσκω το θέμα πολύ ενδιαφέρον όπως και το artwork που είναι καρτουνίστικο και έχει μια retro sci-fi αισθητική. Well done. 

Υπάρχει λοιπόν ένα μεταβλητό ταμπλό στο οποίο κινείτε το σκάφος μας και είναι γεμάτο εμπόδια, κινδύνους και εχθρούς. Ο κάθε παίκτης έχει το πόστο του και παίζουμε ταυτόχρονα όλοι μαζί σε ένα λεπτό το δικό του mini game ο καθένας. Πχ ο πιλότος πρέπει να βγάλει γρήγορα ένα πλάνο αλά Roborally. O υπεύθυνος για τις τορπίλες παίζει Ubongo για να φορτώσει την τορπίλη και μετά ρίχνει μια αλά Pitchcar για να δούμε αν πέτυχε. Νομίζω μπήκατε στο νόημα.

Το ωραίο είναι πως κάπου κάπου το παιχνίδι σε αναγκάζει να αλλάξεις πόστο οπότε αργά ή γρήγορα θα δοκιμάσεις διάφορα mini games και δεν σε αφήνει να βαρεθείς. Όσο το σκάφος δέχεται damage τόσο δυσκολεύουν τα πράματα για όλους. Μια παρτίδα κρατάει περίπου 90 λεπτά αλλά το πηγαίναμε χαλαρά γιατί τρώγαμε και πίναμε. Λογικό ήταν στο τέλος να χάσουμε.

Το παιχνίδι είναι ένα χαβαλεδιάρικο συνεργατικό. Δεν ξετρελάθηκα αλλά δεν θα έλεγα όχι σε μια παρτίδα μια στο τόσο.

This is very hard to get people to play. It's definitely an "event" game. There are a few really unpleasantly fiddly parts, too. It's a lot of fun, and a great experience, but it's hard to offer a blanket recommendation when you need such a particular group for it to work well.

A great game held back by set up and play time. I really did enjoy all of my plays of this game, but over time I am less and less likely to go back just because I know I can get similar feeling games on the table in a fraction of the time (Escape comes to mind).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
+ Good co-op where everyone actually has to participate
+ Since everyone has an own problem to solve there is no risk of one player making all decisions
+ Nice "can't let the others down" feeling with many players
- Probably loses the group pressure feeling with fewer players (less than 5 player)
- Nemesis is annoying. The game needs constraints on mission time, but could this have been achieved just by limiting the turns for a mission?

I can't wait until this game is published.  Think of it as Mario Party (tons of sub-games) including things like memory match, Crokinole, poker, all being done together to try to get your ship through perilous straights.

Definitely different than Space Alert, but has many similarities like timed cooperative space ship work.  One benefit of Space Cadet is that you can fairly easily introduce a new player to the game and not have it hold up the entire team (this is NOT the case in Space Alert).

Downgrading to a 5.  Not quite as much fun after playing it a 2nd and 3rd time.  Would much rather play Space Alert

I love the game, and so did ALL the other players I have tried it with, takes some time to teach new players (if everyone is new players) but after 1-2 games, everyone wants us to succeed and make tactics in this surprisingly deep game when all wants to do the best and gets engaged in the game :)

Pros: 
- Very simple and yet deep game 
- a 'type of mini game' for every type of person
- unlimited combinations of enemies, maps, missions, difficulties
- Great Co-Op game, where all feel important
- A place for the 'Alfa-Gamer'
- there's always something to do
- Easy to teach 1-2 new player per game
- A fun and easy going but deep game
- Great party game, especially if you live into your roles

Cons:
- Hard/long time to teach if all players are new
- Board components could be 5% better (but there is a LOT of components in this game)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quite 'big' and long for my taste, every role it completely different making it quite difficult to remember all the small detail-rules for each of them when explaining the game to new players. It definitely needs a stable group to play with, a thing that unfortunately renders it obsolete it my library. It is just not that good to make it worth keeping.

I will only play this game again if:

I want to teach the importance of collaboration.

or 

If everyone in the group has played this game before.

Epic "Star Trek" game. #2 best co-op I own. The only downsides are the time it takes to set up and explaining the game to new players. When everyone is operating at 100%, you really feel like you're commanding a space ship and completing a mission as a team.

Once I saw that it was basically a bunch of little puzzle games all clumped into one package, I thought to myself, "this is going to be really bad." I just went through a demo alpha mission, but this game may be one of the more impressive designs I've seen in a while. It's taking all sorts of different puzzle ideas (poker, dexterity, roborally, recognize-shapes-by-touch, push-your-luck, pattern recognition, etc.) and mixing them together into a cooperative game where communication actually matters between different players. And, there is even some planning when thinking about completing the entire mission. I'm not sure if each little puzzle would get old fast or not, but the way these ideas were implemented is very impressive.

I own this now and played the alpha training mission with my wife.  She noted that to play the game she felt she had to "leave her cool badge at the door."  She's right, but she gave up her "cool badge" and played and we had a good time.

Okay, I'm not a fan of co-ops nor am I a big sci-fi fan.  This game, though, was pretty fun!  Lots of mini games that all need to be coordinated with the otthers to be successful.  I think it's a pretty cool party game, especailly if the captain keeps things moving along.  The mini games are basically little puzzles, or in the case of shooting, flicking!  I thought this was pretty unique (and works themeatcially).

It's hard to rate this game based on how often I want to play it, because you kinda have to make a scheduled event in order to play.  Not the easiest game to get setup and going but if you can swing it, it's exactly what I want a cooperative game to be.  It would probably benefit from repeated plays by a single group, and I hope to explore that someday.

I as a rule do not like co-op games.  I do find myself enjoying this, even if to my group it is a bit fiddley and requires a lot of runs back to the rulebook.  I am sure this will diminish over time, and grow to be a top requested game.

RATING: 2
I cannot understand the ratings for this game.  This is a never-play again game for me.  And it makes me feel awful because I have no intention of hurting the feelings of anyone who owns it.

Here is a board game version of WarioWare.  30 second 'puzzles' that potentially could be fun if they were quick, non-stop 30 second puzzles.  WarioWare has a ton of useless mini games but they are so fast and one right after the other that you can stomach the stupid games.  Plus, there's a giant amount of variety.  Space Cadets, however, has so little variety and none of the roles are remotely hard.

How can a role be hard if it is intended to be done in 30 seconds?  The artificial difficulty comes only in that you are dealt, for some roles, something that cannot combo well together for one turn, or a bad flick makes you miss.  It is not a mind game kind of hard.

Playing this made me feel like having 5 minutes of fun crammed into 2 hours.  For a co-op, it has almost no need to work with others which means it is really a solo game with others around.  Alpha-playing isn't a big deal since the choices in the game are so basic that there's no skill or smarts necessary.

I shouldn't like this game as it takes a long time to do anything.  A single turn takes at least 15 minutes, so unless the mission is simple, it becomes a very long game.  There's no new mechanics but instead a stew of just about every mechanic available.  (except perhaps area control).  But each turn is fun.  The puzzle elements are good.  So I enjoy it.  The theme works even if each individual activity doesn't exactly match.  For me, it's a fun game and a nice evening.

While the rules overhead to even start playing this game is really really high, it is 100% worth it. There are some fiddly bits about enemy movement and firing that were frustrating to have to reference during the game even though I thought I had done a great job at preparing.

We had a blast with our one play so far and I can't wait to get it back to the table.

The training missions found on BGG or Stronghold's website are a must.

Fun blend of manual dexterity, mental acuity, and grace under pressure.  I'm really enjoying my initial plays of this, but I can't help but wonder if we'll get sick of the puzzle tasks at some point.  Even so, I think it will take many plays before that happens.  You need a BIG table to play this game.  I can see where this could be really fun in a convention setting where you have a huge table and 7 people playing.

We've only played once, so maybe future plays will be better, but this did not go well for us.  I had trouble finding the rules for different situations and made numerous mistakes with the rules which really ruined the game for a few players.

I'd like to try again now that I understand the rules better, but I'm not sure I'll be able to convince my family to do it.

RATING: 6.7
This game is absolutely fantastic.  It's chiefly an experience game, but there is a bit of depth due to difficulty of some of the roles (primarily while under stress of a timer).  It's also a very difficult game, which is how I like my Coops.

Every station seems to be well thought out and present a thoughtful mechanic which just works.  While players may have a preference on a station, no station seems to have been ignored or lacks detail.  

Ultimately, this game just generates those moments which has me thinking about a particular session for days afterwards.  Really looking forward to future plays and perhaps our ship actually surviving long enough to win the game.

NOT THE FAULT OF THE GAME... On the first play I should have realised it was not going to be good when the person who suggested the game proceeded to read the rulebook almost word for word to us... We were already disengaged before the game even began... I did my part brilliantly (Sensor Array) And everyone else did well. Need more ways to shake it up for everyone. Maybe it was the group I was playing with. I may eventually buy this game... but not right now.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

This is a difficult game to rate after just one play, but I'll try!

This is certainly a unique game. It seems to have been designed almost solely to combat the "alpha gamer" issue many co-op games can have. It succeeds, absolutely. Since everything is real time and everyone is doing drastically different things there's simply no time for anyone to start ordering other people about.

Importantly, each little minigame is fun, engaging, and very different from the rest. However they all use familiar mechanics (poker hands, Yahtzee, Tetris, disc-flicking, etc.) because the thing that is supposed to make the game interesting is the time pressure you're under, more than the minigames. This is what I'm not sure will hold up with repeated plays. The time pressure can make the game engaging because it causes stress, but I'm not sure that will continue to be FUN once the novelty of the minigames wears off. Only time well tell, I suppose.

Furthermore, since it was a first play for a few of us, we did a rather easy scenario on the easy difficulty, without the advanced rules so the game was over in about an hour which felt... well, right. I'm not sure the game would continue to be fun for another hour, and everything suggests that with increased difficulty, a different scenario, and advanced rules, it would last just that (or possibly even more)!

I'm curious to try with the advanced rules, because their presence on so many of the little cards and tiles was downright confusing when not using them. I'm not sure what they could possibly add to the experience so I'm really interested in trying them... but mostly because I'm kind of skeptical about them.

It feels like a couple bits of the system are already kind of convoluted. And little things like the way damage works when you hit something vs. when an enemy hits something working differently absolutely make sense mechanically, but kind of hurt the theme for me and are just one other little thing to remember.

If this game SOUNDS appealing to you, then you will probably like it. The time pressure and need to work together / communicate do a lot to add to the feel of manning a spaceship as a team. I guess I'll see how I feel about it over the long haul.

I wanted to like this, but it was disappointing. Main reason is too much downtime. I can see a group with a strong dynamic and role-playing mentality being able to overlook the excessive simplicity and uninteresting board of picking up gems and fighting generic aliens, but it fell flat for my group.

I’m not entirely convinced that the “alpha player syndrome” is absent in this game like some claim; you still have 3 minutes to discuss what to do each turn, and players who know the game better might say “we do this and then this”… It’s true, though, that once that phase is over, you’re all on your own when playing your own station/role! These roles are varied and feel very different and I like most of them. Personally I really dig the Engineering and Shield Operator roles as I like the puzzle aspect and the poker aspect. Because of the “shift change” cards in the game I got to try out a lot of roles but never as the Helmsman. 

A minor niggle I have with the game is that it seemed that once it started to go wrong it could get out of hands really fast! The core breach is a cool mechanic, but man it’s hard! You need to do your normal job AND find the matching cards and pass the pile of cards on to the next player – and every player needs to have done so within 30 seconds or you lose the game! It was a really nice twist even though it was hard. Teamwork and good communication is essential in this game in order to do well; for instance, the helmsman and shield operator need to talk about where to put the shields and such.

I do think it takes slightly longer to play than it should, considering that we spent around 1½-2 hours on our first game. In my second game we lost rather quickly and then started over on the same scenario which took us about 1½ hours to complete I think. That’s the reason I cannot see myself play it all the time, but I still enjoyed it a lot hence my rating of 7.

When I first heard about Space Cadets, I was intrigued. I love Space Alert and consider the real-time implementation of a cooperative game a great way to get rid of the "alpha player" problem. Folks have to work together!

Space Cadets has some intriguing concepts... I like the captain deciding how many actions to spread around to accomplish the team goals... but some things fell a bit flat. Not all puzzles are created equally, and there were too many situations where there wasn't much to do of any interest. 

It's an OK game. I'd try it again. But it was a bit too long and it made me wish we were playing Space Alert instead.

Space Cadets is a fantastic concept that unfortunately has poor execution.  The game simply has too large of a learning curve. 

The game is possible to play with 3 people but is much more practical with 5 or 6, it can be a challenge to assemble this many players.  To make matters worse, you basically need to become the expert at your own station in order to have any chance of survival.  

Your entire experience will depend on whether you can get a sufficient number of people to act as a cohesive group, makes sense right?  To date, I have not found a group of people willing or able to sit down and play through an entire game.  

Maybe with the right group of people it could work, but in almost every situation that group of people has chosen to play another large-group game.

A total different coop: Every player has its own "station" but all players have to work together to be able to fulfill the mission goals. Because of its 9 minigames included the rules explanation can be a bit confusing for new players. Not easy to get a new group into it but I think if every player is familiar with the game it is unbelievable great fun to play!

I appreciate the desire to make a co-op game where there is no alpha gamer, but way too much of this game hinges on the player controlling the missiles.
If your missile player is a Crokinole pro, feel free to take a nap during the game if you get drowsy.  You've already won.
If your missile player can't help but flick the disk off the board, then enjoy your team loss.

RATING: 4
Each player takes a role along with the mini-puzzle associated with that role.  Everyone works their puzzle simultaneously for a limited period of time.  The solution dictates certain variables, like shield strength.  The puzzles feel unrelated to the goal of the game itself:  cooperatively maneuvering a shared spaceship safely to a particular destination.  It sounded interesting but I think it was a cobbled together mish-mash of puzzles (e.g. tangrams, poker dice, etc.) that didn't hang together thematically.

1st play was a 6-player game at ConnCon 2013, taught by Geoff Engelstein and Eric Summerer.  A fun, hectic game similar to Space Alert, but with better mini games.  I was able to man the sensors and then the weapons, after a job switch card.  We lost.  Horribly.  The second core breach did us in.  We needed about 2 more seconds, but it was not to be.  We probably would've gotten blasted right afterward anyway.  I can't wait to play again.  I can see this working with fewer players too, as people just take on multiple roles.  Winner!

Vamos a empezar con una pega: La duración. Si el juego ofreciera la misma experiencia, pero con la mitad de tiempo, estariamos ante el mejor party game para mi gusto. Pero como no lo hace... cuesta sacarlo en mesa.
Ahora, vamos a por lo bueno: Todo lo demás! Un party game cooperativo en el que necesitas tener una gran habilidad para conseguir derrotar al juego. Y amigos con mucha habilidad, porque la cadena es tan fuerte como su eslabón más débil. Aunque haya momentos de frustración, sobretodo cuando a un jugador no le sale lo que tiene que hacer, la diversión que genera este juego lo compensa por completo. Eso si, no hacer muchas partidas seguidas o lo puedes enviar a freir espárragos, tiene pinta de quemar.
Incluye 6 misiones, bastanta rejugabilidad sobretodo si vas cambiando de estaciones.

I really want to like this game, but it takes about as much time to teach as it does to play. I created instructional sheets for each station and I wasn't able to compress the rulebook much. The rules are fairly intuitive, but there are a lot of them which makes it hard to teach. The phases were also fairly hard to keep track of while teaching new players. It's also fairly luck-dependent as well which wouldn't normally be a problem, but it's a pretty large flaw for two reasons. For one thing, there's a large time commitment as I said before. For another, it make it quite difficult to strategize. Helm needs a lot of energy to make sure it ends up going the direction it needs to go, but luck of the draw for engineering means this might not always happen. Damage is absolutely BRUTAL. If ANY damage gets through the shields (and the enemies deal an average of 3.5 damage) it usually makes one or two stations fairly useless. Shields also require a decent bit of energy to get a fair shot at getting them up to a useful amount of strength. 

The only game I played was with 3 players and still had to reference the rulebook several times after reading the rulebook two times, and typing up a summary for each of the stations. 

That said, me and the other players agreed that once you do learn everything, we could see it being a very fun game, but as it is, my rating stands.

Edit: could never get this to the table after the initial play. Traded away 5.12.13

CO-Op game that gives each player different spaceship part to control.

When I first heard about Space Cadets, I figured it would be an instant hit with my group. Lots of individual little mini-games, all translating into the functioning of a spaceship. Frantic, energetic, funny.

Two main hurdles we've hit. Firstly, the rules explanation: Space Cadets is not a straight-forward game. Let alone teaching each person how to play their role, you've also got the overall mechanics that the game functions under. Secondly, admin. Like a lot of games in this area, the fun of the minigames is too frequently diluted with board admin.

From what I've seen, I think Captain Sonar captures the feel that this one was going for - eager to pick it up and try it for myself.

While the individual minigames are just fine, and a clever idea, where the game "core breaches" is in the fiddliness of how everything comes together.

There's just too much going on in this game.  The person that brought the game had to instruct everybody all the way through the long game. It felt like a lighter game because the individual mini-games and puzzles seemed like they should be lighter fare.  Yet putting them all together made the game seem like hopeless chaos. It took quite a while for each player to get comfortable with their role... only to have to change roles several times in the game.  The game was also very long. After the first couple of turns, we could already tell we were doomed, yet we slogged through another couple of hours before we finally blew up.

Only 1 play so far, but I'm not sure I get what this game is going for. Is it going for "light, fast, fun" or "a lot of rules but interesting game play"? With the overhead of rules required (since you might switch places mid-game, you need to learn everything), you'd expect some interesting choices to manage, but instead you just have puzzles that you do over and over. 

The ostensible fun of the game is the real-time element where you have to complete your puzzle in 30 seconds, often while being forcibly distracted by something else. I found that fun for a turn or two but not enough to justify an entire, two-hour game game. After a while, the real-time pressure of the game lost its luster, and I disengaged. For my tastes, a game like Escape the Cursed Temple does real-time well: short, fast, and furious. Generally, I think real-time is better left to electronic games, but I suppose those who like real-time boardgames will find this a joy.

What was missing for me was a sense of tension. I guess it lies in managing the chaos and destruction such that you survive for another go-round of doing your puzzles. If the puzzles start to become repetitive (ah, that must be why they have you change mid-game), then the connection between "will we survive?" and "what I get to do if we survive" weakens and tension dissipates. I quite like the idea of separate stations and would probably have preferred some type of interlocking game based on player choices rather than real-time puzzles. Someone should go make that game.

Pros
-eliminates alpha gamer problem
-several different roles to play as, all of which are important and different

Cons
-requires several players for optimal experience
-roles feel like minigames, but has nothing strong to tie them together (the mission/objective feels like an afterthought)
-game feels a bit chaotic at times
-game is very long for what it aims to be
-missions are kind of bland
-certain stations play a more key role in certain mission than others
-very plain enemy AI that is easily exploitable
-wildly varying damage values (i.e. roll a die, you take 1-6 damage)
-1/2 of tutorial mission and 1/6 of the regular missions not even included in rule book, was told to go online to find it; very lazy/cheap
-very few missions included in game, lack of long term replayability

This is a really fun game in the vein of Space Alert, though I wonder about the longevity of the Sensor and Weapons loading games (they're almost the same each time). Not sure if there is as much coordination as in Space Alert too...

On the other hand, I like the variety of tasks, and the reactor breach death mechanic is brilliant.

Tentative review:

The game really feels like the crew is scrambling to make the poor ship from falling apart while under pressure and attacks from random ships. The theme is there and the different stations are a lot of fun. The components are fairly well made, if a little lacking in graphic design.

There are some down falls that prevent this game from being one of my favorites.
The length of time and complexity in teaching the game to people, especially multiple people, is daunting. Each station has it's own set of rules, exceptions and special cases. But all players should have at least a basic understanding of how to play each station. Additionally, how each station relates to each other is pretty vast to understand. Helm needs to position the ship so the shields are most effective, as well as preventing damage (to save Damage Control extra work), evading different obstacles and keeping the ship locked on to enemy ships and crystals so Sensors, Tractor Beams and Weapons can fire. So, in that respect, you have a sort of individual solo mini game, but at the same time, you need to think of the big picture and communication is key. Those are strong points, but also downfalls when teaching the game. 
Second downfall is that the game is incredibly long for what it is. Normally, I love 3-4 hour games, but to play 3 or 4 hours of 30-Tetris and flick the disk... Gets exhausting.

Overall, the game is fun, chaotic and stressful in good ways. It is probably the most unique game I've played, especially as a co-op game. It feels like you are on board the Enterprise and the space ship feel is there. But it looses a major point or 2 for it's combo of length and lack of substance to keep it interesting for such a length of play.

You need a big table for this one. Very complicated with a ton of moving parts, but a wonderful game for a party night with friends. The interplay between the stations combined with the difficulty being such that nobody is really able to solve their puzzles perfectly ensures a wonderful, light-hearted experience with the right crowd. When this game clicks, it creates a memorable evening.

Confusion and chaos trying to control a spaceship on a crazy adventure. Vlaada did it better, I think. The mini-games that represented our stations were distracting from the theme. Then again, this was a rushed game where we fought to complete within the remaining daylight as well as needing to leave soon.

Hectic and often difficult game.  It's like a co-op Galaxy Trucker with timed minigames, and that can be as funny as it sounds... occasionally.  Mostly it's just frustrating and confusing.  It trades the "alpha gamer" problem for small silos of activity that have isolated rules that need to be tracked and taught by a moderator.  Can you tell that this was designed by a parent and his kids?

Component quality is, honestly, kind of a bummer. Flimsy and unsatisfying. Kind of feels like a nice prototype. All of the mats (which is most of the stuff in the box) are thin card stock. I don't mind this in a war game since I can put plexi over it, but I can't do this with small individual mats. Hopefully some later editions will have thicker mounted boards.

I still think we must be doing something wrong when playing this game.  It looks like a lot of fun, but every time our group brings this to the table we don't seem to have fun.

Not only does it take too long to resolve the action of the stations but every time we've played it we've been beaten down badly by the game.

It's still in my collection for now, but I think I will need to see this on the table with an experienced player before I bring this back to the group again.

Got it at Essen 2012 with miniature ships, mini-expansion and author's signature. :-) 

Working my way through the rules was a nightmare, not because they are bad rules, but because there is so much stuff in them to remember. Also, looking things up during the game always takes quite some time.

The game itself is great. I really like it. The different stations are very neat and work well. The training missions, which can be found online, are a good way to get into the game.

Components are so-so.

Players are cooperatively running a spaceship. Each player controls part of the ship -- shields, gun, steering -- with a little mini-game done with a timer.

Neat idea, but just way too long and complicated for what it wants to be, a light co-op with real-time pressure. Because each person has his own little game, it means it's a simple game's rules times six. It has a longer and more detailed rulebook than many wargames. Feels very amateurish.

Our rules explanation took 45 minutes (!) and the game took about 2 hours and 15 minutes. Even allowing for the long rules explanation, the fun and novelty was gone after about an hour. There is at most an hour of fun in the game; the mini-games are clever for a couple of tries, but not over and over. 

Another critical flaw is that as your ship takes damage, it becomes less efficient. This essentially means that everyone gets to do less and less as the game goes on. One guy literally had nothing to do for the last 45 minutes of the game, because there was not enough energy to allocate to his section. That's terribly backwards.

I love the concept of this game.  But for what it was, there seem to be way too many rules and fiddly things happening.  There were lots of small rules we had to keep referring too which disrupted the flow of the game.  The skill games were interesting but by the end of the game it felt more like busy work then us actually doing anything.

I'd like to give it another try to be sure my assessment is on target.

First play with 6 new players was tough. We played a lot of rules wrong, but did pull out a win (probably because the wrong rules were in our favour). The second game with only 3 players (1 new) was much more exciting and fun for all despite the severe increase in difficulty (on easy!). I think 3 players is best for this game as all players will be more constantly busy, but the core breaches are very challenging because the number of breach cards doesn't change!
Great game design :)

First of all, it's overlong, especially at first. More damning, however, is that it is awkward at any player count--play multiple stations at once, and it's too taxing to manage all the different rules and components you have to switch between. Play a single station, and you do too little to keep you engaged. Too much forced downtime in either case.

A cooperative game in which every player is engaged in a completely different activity.  This is a great idea and makes it already more interesting to me than most co-ops are. The doesn't, however, jettison the idea of players working together; the planning phase is very important and it is more interesting because each player has a different point of view, unlike most co-ops which kind of flatten that out.  As for the specific minigames that comprise Space Cadets, I've only played Sensors and Damage & Repair, both of which I found pretty entertaining.  I am a little intimidated by some of the other roles, especially since many of them seem to involve some spatial/shape rotating aspect, which is something I do rather poorly.  In any case, however, it's the planning phases that make this greater than the sum of its parts. (1 play, Sensors)

A fun co-op game where you all take positions helping fly a space ship. Mini-games form the basis of interaction with the ship and the timer bring a nice level of mild panic as you attempt to complete your tasks in the time allotted. However the game takes a while to play and the navigation and scenarios are rather dull, would love to see that replaced with a galaxy trucker style set of random events to keep the energy and the pace. All to easily this game descends into going through the motions.

Space Cadets is a great, appealing idea on paper (real-time co-operative gameplay involving fast-paced mini-games sounds fantastic). The problem is that the complexity is off the charts compared to how little each player is actually going to do.

Each player needs understand what every other player is doing as well as the overall rules of the game that is the result of these station games. That means over thirty minutes of explanation in order to play a game that really only required a few minutes to explain.

For a dedicated group, this could be a fun recurring game. For everyone else, it's a nightmare.

Everybody takes a role or two and you cooperate to try to complete a starship mission complete with mining and fighting enemies.

Fun, well-crafted, timed/stress coop game. Interesting use of abstract minigames to simulate the individual tasks, although I don't personally care much for those type of games.

I like that each player has his own, distinct, well-defined area of responsibility, so there's really no way of hiding in the shadows, so to speak.

As a real-time, "stress" coop game, SC is well-made and fun. Not really my type of game though.

RATING: 4
This isn't really a co-op game at all as there isn't much discussion on what to do other than pick a ship and go after it because it maybe has the least health. It's mini games taken from classic games (robo rally, ubongo, cronkinole, memory matching, etc.). You take what you can get from the randomness of the mini-games and just assign it out. It's pretty obvious what you can and can't do so there isn't much strategy or tactics - either the cronkinole player hits the target and blows up the ship or he doesn't. Either the helm player drives the ship in a pre-programmed style correctly or not.

This is more of a party and dexterity game, but the game is too bogged down and tedious to be what it needs to be - fun, frenetic, fast paced, short on total play time. The lack of co-op means there isn't much discussion - just some random laughs as one or two things fall apart. This will become annoying and frustrating later.

The long explanation and setup, tedious nature of the game, overly long playing time ruin a potentially fun time. The panicky "get your stuff done" in 30 seconds conflicts with the otherwise slow and monotonous pace of the game and gets you amped up for nothing. I was hoping for the Nemesis ship to come in and cream us all so that we could finish up and put it away.

I received my copy of the game last week, when I opened many components were loose so they wrinkled some tiles and the game manual. I “crushed” the game tiles under a heavy table but the manual continues to show some damage. My complaint is that the game components doesn’t fit in the box insert correctly thus (practically) guaranteeing that there will be some damage. This is the first game insert I’m glad to get rid of. 

I hope to play this game soon, a friend said he was going to read the rules but when he saw he size of the manual, he bailed out :S so I think it is up to me.

I played this last week and I was kind of disappointed. I need to give it another chance and play with the advanced rules but for now it stands as a mediocre game with good ideas on it.

When I heard about it I was very excited, in fact I’m the only one in my game group that has it. The minigames (a la Funfair but IN SPACE :D) seemed like lots of fun and they are up to some point BUT they can get very repetitive very quickly. Also the game can take its sweet time, it is very long :(. The game manual is pretty long for what the game offers and the game components list is not very well done, I would love to have a regular component list to check but it is spread around the stations on the game manual. The explanation is around the 1 hour mark.

Another complaint I have is the 3 minute sand timer, it is “almost” useless as you are doing your tasks no one is paying attention to it, we replaced with an electronic timer and we had much more fun that way. I also wish the game components to be more sturdier. 

The theme IS awesome and the game is fun for a short amount of time.

For now, I hope the game explainer made some rules mistakes somewhere. I will read the rules soon and I will play again to re rate and comment again. I really want to like this game but Space Alert is still king for me.

I think I would like it much more it the play time was much more shorter.

You are a crew of space cadets piloting a ship. There is a square grid that the ship moves through, you try to collect some crystals (or something equally silly) while avoiding shooting down enemy ships and mostly trying to avoid the big-bad-nemesis ship.

There are several stations on the ship that need to be womaned, each station has a mini-game attached to it. These mini games are kind of cute but having to play them repeatedly throughout the game is boring. I found that people quickly specialized at their mini-game and although there are opportunities to switch stations for the sake of the actual game (piloting the space craft) it was generally a bad idea to have novices. This would go away with experience, but by that point you would surely be bored stiff no matter what station you were given.

It has some neat ideas and brings something fresh to the co-op genre. For those that like the game I'm sure it will be fun to play. However, it's far too light and boring for my tastes. This just isn't my idea of fun.

Sad to say this didn't come close to meeting my group's expectations. So far, our general opinion of the game is that it's light and light-hearted but with way too much confusion in its execution ("messy" is a common word I keep hearing as people I play with describe their experience) and not rewarding enough to be fun. My family and friends just can't get into it despite me making everyone think I enjoy the game and having an expert (not me) explain the game. I plan on playing it a few more times before giving up on it though.

A fun thematic game that gets extremely bogged down when introducing it to new players. There are several mini-games, all with their own set of rules. And all of those contribute to the meta-game that is sort of ran by the Captain. 

From a pure game-play design, it works pretty well, but it's essentially a game full of very random outcomes. If you're looking for a cooperative game full of difficult decision making, this isn't it.

Not all is lost though. While there are lots of random aspects to the mechanics, many of them still require a fair amount of skill. (Mostly awareness) In my plays, some people have just been better at some stations, and not other stations.

From my experience, this game is best played from the perspective of letting the game and the Captain play as sort of a Game Master, and the people running their station  get into and playout their roles as if they were members of a star ship.

I'm surprised that this found an audience, as I can't imagine who this is for. More serious gamers will scoff at the flicking or other silly mini games. Fluffy gamers (like me) should be scared away by the outrageously long play time and abundance of rules.

I would never willingly play this again, though I'm holding out hope for the dice version, which seems to have corrected the play time issue, and seems to have cut down on rules as well.

The introductory game was good. But then it devolved into monotony. Playing the same mini-game over and over (ignoring the occasional shiftchange) is tiresome. This is compounded by the fact that later missions are extremely long. It just seems to be too slow to move between map sections, particularly because of the Roborally style cards (i.e. a majority of the cards turn your ship away from the direction you need to travel in.)

If they released quicker/smaller scenarios, I wouldn't mind it, but for the time-being, its really not a game I enjoy.

Each sub-station is a game unto itself with none of them very difficult.  However, Learning to play all of them takes some time and patience.  Don't use the "shift change" cards with new players and you should be okay.

Nice party game but to complex to be played as a light party game. We had fun when we played iT, but iT al came down to the flick of a chip eventually. For a game of this length that's not something I look for in a game.
The moment was great, but it felt that everything before was a bit obsolete.

Frantic and amusing for a while, but gets old fast as the game pummels you to goo because someone on your crew is no good with memory or robot instructions. I would try this again with a full compliment of crew, but overall I am not a fan of boardgames played in realtime, I have PC games for that.

RATING: 5
This is not really a game for 3 or 4 players at all.  5 or 6 just works so much better.  It's far far too long for what it is.  Takes forever in a day to teach what amounts to 7 or 8 different games in one.  This is probably its biggest fail as its so rules dense and long for a game that is very light.  My wife did not like the solitaire nature of everyone doing their own little mini-game even if, in theory, your getting together for big planning sessions.  Most of the time its pretty obvious what the overall course of action will be.  
Captain:  Not much of interest to do here besides look for opportunities to use the 'special' experimental equipment card.
Engineering:  The simplest of tile laying games made only more difficult by trying to match more desirable symbols under the time pressure.  Probably the second best mini-game to Weapons but still pretty boring after 2 hours or a few games.
Helm:  Programmed movement and all the board play seem to really bog the game down.  I can't help but wonder if this game should have done without the board entirely and been streamlined more with cards only to hit closer to the 60 minute mark.
Sensors:  Pick a matching shape from a bag.  Normally a game for 3-4 years olds (I had several) but with a time crunch put on it.  Still wears thin quickly.
Tractor Beam:  Memory Match.  Again normally a game for 3-4 year olds but no time crunch on this one means its still the same game (Leaves me scratching my head).
Weapons:  The most fun mini game by far.  Fill cards from a pile of tetris shapes to fill in the whole picture under a time crunch and then flick a disc for each correctly completed one far down the track but not off it to see what damage is done.
Shields:  Clever the first time or two but ultimately not that interesting and very random.  Try to make poker type sets out of random number tiles drawn.  A few tricks such as doubling for using all of one color (out of 2) and having 2 numbers as wild for the other 4 sets.
Jump Drive:  Yahtzee in a way where you need 5 of a kind but can reroll some for an energy and can earn up special cards to do other things like adding or subtracting 1 etc.
Damage and Repair:  Really boring job, not unlike Captain, where you just draw a card and roll dice maybe.  I suppose technically Core Breach is part of this even though all players participate.  Its just matching shapes by looking through a deck of cards under time pressure.
Conclusion:  It's by no means an awful game.  From a game design standpoint it's certainly new ground but I feel it needs refinement as its just much too long given its lightweight and party-like play.  And the rules clock in at 32 pages (YES that's 32 pages).  So assuming they are that long due to many examples, references, and covering of any conceivable situation its still FAR too much for a game like this.  This is probably a game that should have had a full page player aid/combo board for each station and then some kind of reference section for anything else and examples.  Not sure but not the approach used here.
The consoles are just lightweight cardstock as well and totally lackluster from a graphical perspective.  Some thick boards and a Star Trek console sort of graphical design would have leaps and bounds helped with the thematic immersion of the game.
It's looking like I'm not much of a fan of games played under a time crunch nor party style games in general.  I am a huge Sci-Fi game fan but ultimately the two reasons I'm parting with this game is that it's not good with 3 players and its way too long for what it is (Feels even longer with 3-4 players having to do everything).

I thought that this game could be better, really.
It's simply too much stuf to keep track, Captain will repeat over and over things to the crew. Also the 30" timmer makes it very difficult. Try with 45", i will help a lot! Pay close attention to the Pilot, he is damm essential! If a bad player is there, it will be chaos.

Each player has their own board, and their own mini-game to learn and track. Each player's piece of the game is quite simple, and easy to pick up, but bootstrapping a whole group to play the game for the first time can take some time.

We haven't gotten it back to the table with new players, but I would expect adding 1-2 new players to be very fast, since they (mostly) only have to learn one or two positions to get going.

Really wanted to like this game since I'm a fan of Stronghold, but the game was too frenetic and confusing.   First off you need a lot of people (at least 5) to play...

It's not really the type of game I would buy, but I cannot say it was not funny especially for arguing or laughing  with other players for doing things badly.

My complaints are that there is are so many mechanics that the possibility of errors and ambiguity is enormous. Second, the missions seems pretty dull, and the nemesis arrives so soon in the game that it's impossible to finish the mission.

I strongly prefer the dice game since the mechanics are more uniformed through the various stations.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed my first play even if it did take a bit over three hours with the rules instruction.  Despite playing five player, I felt fully engaged most of the time and teamwork/cooperation is very helpful to being effective towards winning the game.  Some of the minigames are probably not as enjoyable (IE, I wouldn't want to be the tractor beam and play memory) but they are different.  The fact that damage can force two players to change roles can really throw a wrench into plans as well.  Reminds me quite a bit the spaceship simulator Artemis but in boardgame form.  Appreciated that even when things looked quite bleak for us in our first game, we found out that comebacks are able to occur as we finally put things together to win.  The core breach mechanic is really nasty though, forcing players to try to play two minigames in the same 30 seconds - yikes!

Auf Zeit versuchen alle Spieler gleichzeitig ihre jeweiligen Stationen richtig einzustellen um die Mission zu erfüllen.
Man hat 3 Minuten Zeit seine Taktk mit den anderen zu besprechen, dann hat man 30 Sekunden Zeit diese Taktik für seine Station auszuführen...
Der Capitän verwaltet Sanduhr und die Abfolge der Spielzüge,
Der Maschinist puzzelt Halbkreise zusammen um den anderen Stationen Energie für die Folgerunde zu liefern,
Der Steuermann zieht Karten und ordnet diese an -> so wird das Schiff fliegen,
Der Sensorheini erfühlt aus einem Sack eine bestimmte Form,
Die Schadenskontrolle hab ich nicht verstanden
Die Waffenkonsole puzzelt Tetristeile auf ein Feld und muss späte die zusammengepuzzelten Torpedos schnipsen (nicht zu stark und nicht zu schwach) und
die Schildgenerator-Dame versucht mit gezogenen Plättchen Reihen oder Zwillinge/Drillinge zu bilden.
Das Spiel hat mehr Spaß gemacht als anfangs angenommen. Ich dachte an ganz andere Dinge als ich hörte was es zu tun gilt. Es wird aber dennoch nicht mein Echtzeitspiel, das ich immer wieder spielen möchte. Da lieber 1-2 Runden Escape oder XCOM.

In Space Cadets, you take on different roles on spaceship bridge.  Each role is a puzzle that somewhat fits the role you are playing.  None of the puzzles are complicated but yu are doing them against a timer.  

The game is fun, but it seems you need at least 4 players to play and the more players the better.  The game can run very long, it is complex to teach and in theory it is family weight but until you know how to play you get destroyed quickly.  Some of the roles don't work well for younger kids.  It is not for 8 year olds at all.  

I would actually play this with 10 and up and even then the duration may make it run too long.  I do like the game though and would like to play again.

Timed Dexterity based cooperative game played in phases. During each phase specific roles accomplish simple but rushed tasks such as identifying simple tetris pieces by touch, matching tiles memory style, or completing tangram style puzzles. This determines how successful your team of rag tag crew are as you attempt to accomplish your mission. Plays in about an hour with up to 6 players. Better at higher player counts to keep the game moving.

Unfortunately, this games seems to demand at least 4-5 players to be really good. Less than this can overwhelm them, as they will have different stations to care for.

It's a good concept; Space Alert with a bunch of minigames like RoboRally, Memory, Ubongo, Yahtzee with dice, Yahtzee with chits, etc., and all the games fit well their assigned stations thematically. However there's a bunch of problems in practice. Having nine minigames means having a trillion bits and decks and fluff for each of them, and the maintenance is cumbersome. An action round lasts for 30 seconds, this should make SC a tense game, but the preparations and clean-up gets in the way all the time. It's nowhere near the constant rush of Space Alert, which would be the point. Teaching the game is a nightmare, since the games are simple and well known, but there are plenty of nuances to keep in mind, and a first few times are clunky at best with new players. Unfortunately however the minigames get boring after the initial acclimatisation period, so its hard to get into it, and nothing keeps in later. 
I'm sorry about it, it's a likable, nice game; it just doesn't work for us.

The game is just cardboard but the materials are of noticeably worse quality than other games like Space Alert. 

The player mats are paper, not cardboard, and on mine the corners were starting to peel. The packing in the box was loose, so when I opened my set things had shaken around so much I thought it was a used set.

Even if the game were simple, it's 6 or more minigames, so it takes quite a while to teach a table of new players. And even on our 3rd play we were still consulting the rules a lot. This slows down the game and the interrupts the feeling of the theme. Maybe more info should be printed on the player mats instead of in the rulebook.

We love this game, but it feels like it needs polish.

Game in a Nutshell: Man stations on the deck of a spaceship's bridge and play varied minigames to execute your unique role.

Played as: 5 player (Intro rules)

Pros: Each mini game is good challenge on their own; especially when the timer is running. There's no bossing people around in this coop since everyone is so busy playing their own game simultaneously. Great artwork. Great concept of working together but in completely unidentical roles.

Cons: The game is made of so many simple, but very different, parts that it becomes unwieldily complex. Which leads to my biggest turnoff, I can't imagine trying to teach it in a brief simple matter that would accomodate the lighter crowd the game would be perfect for. And I don't believe a more hardcore crowd would stick with it long enough to reach an optimal "groove" with the system. I love the idea, but the initial hurdle of having to learn basically 6+ (mini)games instead of one cohessive one (let alone the synergy between them) makes the ease of entry a bit too daunting.

Other: I guess this "review" is really more about my impressions of the game's accessability rather than the game itself. But since I didn't progress past that entry point (it was a convention demo), I can only speak for the frustration of learning the game myself. It's not hard to see a worthwhile game in there, but I just can't see ever reaching it with the types of gamers I play with. 

Best Use: Great if you had a patient audience who would stick through a few clunky learning games.

This is always seems to be better in my head than when we get it on the table. Despite what seem to be easy rules, it always ends up more complicated than I was expecting. And for a game like this I think complication can hurt it's chances of getting to the table. Ultimately I think Captain Sonar or even it's brother, Dice Duel, would always be chosen before this game.

Great co-op game that makes you feel you are on control of one of the stations of the enterprise. Even if you don't like the theme so much, it's a game you should try. The mini games that make for each of the stations are all really funny and most of them are flavorful (i. e. the mini game for weapons, where you first play a tetris like game to represent the preparation of the torpedos, and then the other half of it, where you have to throw the litte disk to represent the actual firing). 

I should mention, it's a pretty hard game: most of the time,in order to win, you need everybody to get their mini game right or the turn will be wasted. However, that doesn't take away from the fun, unless you (or some of your crew) are one of those persons that can only find fun in winning.

I wanted to like this one, but it just didn’t really grab me. Basically, each player is a member of the bridge crew of a starship and executes their individual role in parallel with their fellow crew members. In game terms this involves each player playing a ‘mini game’ to achieve a certain goal in line with the overall mission.

I was pretty underwhelmed by this game as each ‘mini-game’ is a bit simple (or even dull) and didn’t really grab me with dynamic gameplay, interesting decisions or even overly flash components. For example, I was the pilot and played a round of mini RoboRally, while the weapons officer plays a flicking game etc.

I can see why people like it, it does provide a good social experience, but the game itself is, I feel, lacking.

Not one I’ll seek out again and definitely not one for purchase.

It seems like a great party game for the gamer crowd.  The trouble is that it takes so long to teach it, that you actually need dedicated gamers to play it.

Interesting coop board game. Every station is a small game within the overall meta game which must be coordinated with the other players.  Sounds quite interesting.

I really like this game and it feels like you're really working together. The only thing that goes against it is it's fairly long. Had one play ruined by a couple of players deciding to not take it seriously enough which annoyed other players who wanted to continue and them quitting essentially ended the game in a bad place. This one definitely relies on good sports and for everyone to commit to finishing.

Quite fun between the mechanics and theme its the whole package. The variety of mini-games means there is likely something for everyone. The right balance of randomness means that when something goes wrong (and it will) you laugh and blame it on that rather than feeling you let everyone down.

Great fun with 3 people.

Die einzelnen Regelsysteme sind schnell zu erlenen, doch sie täuschen nur kurz darüber hinweg, wie unnötig komplex und lang das Spiel gestaltet ist. 

Einige Stationen machen weniger Spaß als andere oder sind schlicht unterfordernd. Man muss bei Space Cadets wirklich ein Auge zudrücken, mit etwas Rollenspielenthusiasmus ist es jedoch eine willkommene Abwechslung zu Spielen wie Space Alert. Es gibt auf jeden Fall Abende an denen es ein Must Play ist.

So far, this is the best co-op I've played.  It gets rid of the 'leader' problem.  However, there's a lot of bits to this game and it's essential that all players are familiar with the game in order to win.

RATING: 7.5
This game hits a very small niche: not completely unlike Dungeon Lords, this is a hardcore gamers casual game. Explaining the rules takes really long because there are 9 mini games and the main game to explain. Probably a really good game, but I am not sure for whom exactly.

Oh man was I hot for this game for a turn, glad I got to try it first.  The idea is great, for 1.5 hrs everyone is on the same team, each individual responsible for their own little mini-game that is a small cog in the big machine of driving a space ship through the cosmos.  

What actually happens is you are playing the same mini-game for 2 hrs.  I remember my wife getting extremely bored when it came time for her to pull out a specific shape from a bag for the fifth time...even I was kind of tired of flicking my disc down the track.

RATING: 4
I wanted to like this game.  I mean, I REALLY wanted to like it.  The idea is brilliant: Everyone in a co-op game has one role they've got to do, which eliminates the "I'm TELLING you what to DO!" issue with co-ops.  And the mini-games themselves are interesting.

But the time.  Oh, my G-d, the time.  This is the clunkiest non-wargame I've played in ages.  Nothing flows.  Everything's awkward.  And when a hit to the ship forced players to assume different roles, after the hour-long explanation of every player's roles, un-fun was had in bushels.

I applaud the effort the same way I applaud Android.  And there's going to be some people who eat this game up, but they're not me.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Really unique cooperative game where the cooperation does not consist in debating the global strategy. Each player has their role and they work alone in their station, playing minigames.

Rule heavy. You need some time to fully understand what is happening and you need some games to really enjoy it.

The minigames are just OK, or not that interesting; it's the combined effect what makes the game unique.

The components are just OK.

There's a lot going on here, but somehow it all works. Each player is messing around with his own puzzle or puzzles, but those also affect the other players. It is the thought that went into how these things interact that makes this an outstanding game.

*遊戲中只有操作玩家可以碰，其他玩家只能口頭幫助
*地圖 根據任務的起使設定，只有一張地圖板塊在桌面，其餘等到感應器探查到或太空船行經，才會從板塊堆中底部抽出，板塊上的物件(水晶與敵艦)可以先抽好

**艦長 紀錄遊戲步驟跟計時 第一行每次沙漏漏完就倒置到下一個格，在第一次遊戲時的第一回合可不限時間，不同階段皆可休息，開始時船長挑選4張實驗裝備卡，一回合最多使用1張，使用後移除。

2.準備階段工程板塊向下洗勻隨機抽7張，3.行動階段板塊翻面盡量拼出夠多完整的圖案，每一個完整個工作站下回合有一個能源                                                                                                                         
>進階 電池 一開始有兩個可自由分配後當能源使用，如果抽到損壞卡還未使用就爆炸

**主舵 2.準備階段 將能源分配到加速格(一個可以移動速度上或下一格)和移動格，根據速度加機動格能源值抽隨機一般移動卡
3.行動階段 翻開一般移動卡，自由分配到移動格上(張數等於速度)，可自由使用特殊移動卡來放但是要接受懲罰，來不及填滿就隨機放一般
4.結算階段根據卡片規則移動，經過不同地點結算，特殊行動卡擲骰結算傷害，之後洗勻所有一般移動卡                                                                                                                                
>小行星群asteroids 進去擲骰 距離大於骰數的敵艦失去鎖定，123點收到同點傷害在隨機部位
>星雲nebula 進去擲骰，失去敵艦鎖定同上，12點失去感應器的一個鎖定標記(自己決定)
>重力gravity arrow 根據經過方向加減速度
>時空裂痕rift 擲骰子根據點數獲得傷害在隨機位置
>水晶與敵艦crystals and enemy ships  對移動不造成任何影響。
>未掃描到的地圖版塊unscanned map tile 抽一張新的並根據任務放置單位
>象限邊緣sector edge 馬上停止並受兩點隨機傷害，180度轉向，速度降為0，剩餘的機動卡全部取消
*計算距離 不包括斜線移動，時空裂痕會阻隔兩艘船艦的直線距離
>進階 躲避特殊卡可使用但必須放在第一格，移動時擲一顆骰子，決定位置，5或6不動，此回合敵艦傷害減1

**感應器 2.將最多3個目標卡放在圖板ABC位置取代原本的(上面東西棄掉)，每一個能源就抽一張感應卡放目標卡或掃描區下方
3.行動階段 從袋中摸板塊同等於感應卡張數次，摸出對應的就放上面不對的也要挑一張放
4.每一個有正確板塊獲得1感應分，當回合用完，之後卡片洗回牌庫，板塊丟回袋中，回合結束絕對鎖定翻面 
>鎖定(1分)：將鎖定標記(lock)置於敵艦或水晶卡上。
>絕對鎖定(3分)：將絕對鎖定(superlock)標記置於探測圖板上。
>鎖定升級(2分)：將鎖定標記翻到絕對鎖定那面。
>解除鎖定(1分)：將敵艦標記從被鎖定翻到未鎖定那面。
>象限掃瞄(1分)：抽一張未知的地圖板塊，擺放到象限地圖上，依照任務規則放置單位在上面，地圖板塊不可以任意轉動。
>進階 隱蔽裝置 2.可放置兩張感應卡隱蔽格下，兩張成功就啟動，所有敵軍要鎖定我軍的骰子點數全部減2，移除所有鎖定跟絕對鎖定，且該回合不能鎖定                                                             

**牽引光束 5.每個能量可翻兩格，一樣可用上面點數，不一樣蓋回，要鎖定才能用，絕對鎖定時分數加倍，最大距離4，需要點數等於自己速度加上目標距離                                                                                                                          
*使用過的移除，玩家可隨時選擇重置，全部重洗放回
>成功投射 水晶就移除 敵艦則傷害加倍 失敗蓋回，有能源就可以嘗試
>進階 三光束 翻版塊前宣布使用，可一次翻三個，成功配對分數加上第三塊的一半(無條件進位)，接著移除這3張，如果3張不同受一點內部傷害

**武器 2. 一個能源抽一張魚雷卡蓋著 3.卡片翻面想辦法拼出來，完成幾張可以發射幾顆 
6.射程6格，且最短距離有裂縫不能發射，一次發射一顆，武器圓片置於軌上對應距離後方，用指彈的發射，壓線算高的，根據是否鎖定看不同數字，若有牽引光束攻擊力加倍，碰到桌面就沒傷害
>傷害達到敵艦防禦力總值敵艦摧毀，要先扣護盾，損壞標記記錄損傷。
>進階 追蹤飛彈 2.選擇是否使用，使用追蹤飛彈的管線放2張魚雷卡(一樣1能源)，發射時第一次彈完(還在板上)可在彈第二次

**護盾 2.根據能量拿對應護盾板塊蓋著放前面，3.翻開擺到護盾區，中央兩個四區都算，中央數字不能相同
5.每一區根據牌型拿分數(只拿高的)，然後記錄到護盾上，如果外圍3個擺滿顏色相同分數加倍，回合結束歸0
>進階 異鉻增強器 3.可以使用該標記放在中央以外區域，可當橘或藍色，下回合翻面佔據該格，之後回手可再使用                                            

**跳躍 完成任務後要跳躍離開地圖，必須骰出5個一樣數字，骰出的結果可以拿幫助卡，每張卡每回合使用一次，用後翻面下回合可以翻回來使用，在一開始將12張卡放在圖板左邊的那邊
9.至少1個能量才能執行，一次擲5顆，可使用卡片改變數字或使用1能量重骰任意，5顆一樣就可跳出，如果未完成跳躍且也未得到任何新卡，則隨機部位受到1點的內部損壞，1枚能源也可改成延長30秒
>進階 閃瞬 8結束時，可以進行，執行時將一張贏得的跳躍卡從右放回左邊，太空船移動任意2格，正面任意方向

**損壞與修復 遊戲設置依難度構築損壞牌庫，核心損壞標記置於0的位置，OK面向上，敵軍攻擊根據太空船方位，對角則船長選，隨機擲骰(56艦長決定)，護盾一點抵消一點損壞。
>內部造成的損壞護盾無法抵消，並隨機出現在4個區域，每一點損壞抽一張損壞卡，立即影響結算，持續影響給部分負責人
>交換位置時只要有兩個人換所有工作就好
*修復 目的是要將持續效果移除，一回合最多4能源，9.即使沒有能源，依舊可以嘗試修復，抽卡後計時，抽到自己停，成功放右，失敗放左，要骰的就看骰結果，每個能源可以棄掉一張卡
>結算時先結算失敗卡，每張失敗造成1點隨機損傷，之後結算修復移除對應張數的持續效果卡，自動修復卡要移除，其他洗回去

**核心損壞 沒損壞卡抽時，剩餘點數不管多少將核心損壞標記前進一格(每個事件分開)，並翻到核心損壞那面，11格到頂
*>核心損壞修復  3.行動時所有玩家同時進行修復 2.抽出與核心損害數字同數量的牌，艦長發，一人一張面向下，將核心修復牌堆洗牌後，交給有核心損害卡的人
3. 行動時同時從修復牌推找一樣的牌，成功後將牌堆交給下一位有核心損壞卡的隊友。
◎玩家一次只能修復一張核心損壞卡，第二張要等第二輪牌堆傳到手上時才能修復，一次只能修一張，如果有人沒找到太空船爆炸，任務失敗，修復成功，將標記翻回OK，但位置不變，不是OK面時跳躍階段不能花能源

**敵艦行動   依難度隨機抽敵敵艦卡放置敵艦，方向沒差 7.敵艦行動分成幾個部分依序執行，哪艘先動由玩家決定
1.嘗試鎖定玩家的太空船 丟骰數字大於距離則翻面鎖定成功，被攻擊時馬上鎖定 
2.移動／失去鎖定   鎖定後向玩家移動敵艦卡上標示的格數，同格就停住，障礙物對敵艦有影響  時空裂縫/小行星群－敵艦受到1點損壞
3.向玩家的太空船開火 如時空裂縫在直線會阻止開火，不然射程內就會開火，每一個白色方塊執一骰，傷害值會依太空船速度修正，移動到同格時傷害來自來的方向，一開始就同格就隨機，移動後超過6格失去鎖定

**勁敵  隨時鎖定玩家且不能被摧毀，一開始時，將勁敵標記放在任務指示的格子上 7.尚未進入遊戲則往0移動一格，在數字0的位置，從任務開始位置進入遊戲(可用損壞標記標示)該回合不移動不開火
>進入後同敵艦行動，勁敵標記往反方向移動一格，不能超過3(黃色圓圈標示)，速度跟強度依據標記數字調整，玩家每造成勁敵2點傷害，標記就後退一格。
>經過太空障礙物，每損壞一點勁敵標記往後移動一格，標記永遠不會超過3，也不會低於-2。

**任務 任務說明包含了地圖設置，黑色位置先放地圖，白色則遊戲中在放(從底部抽)，板塊有2艘敵艦和一個水晶時，水晶置於中央，敵艦置於與水晶相鄰的相反兩格。
>圓形符號的顏色與文字代表敵艦的難度 E：簡單    N：正常   H：困難 有*代表根據遊戲難度調整敵艦難度，簡單降一級，困難升一級

**任務1：跳躍採晶礦 收回所有的水晶並撤離 太空船起始速度：2 勁敵標記：5
目標：藉由牽引光束獲取全部的水晶，並跳躍離開象限。
特別規則：無

**任務2：斥侯巡查  偵察並標記敵艦的位置，找出最好的前進路線 太空船起始速度：2 勁敵標記：4
目標：移除全部4個水晶標記並跳躍離開象限，每摧毀3艘敵艦可以代替一個水晶標記。
特別規則： 必須移動到或穿越有水晶的格子來移除水晶標記，牽引光速只能鎖定敵艦，而不能擷取水晶

**任務3：埋伏！ 太空船起始速度：0   勁敵標記：6
目標：跳躍離開象限
特別規則：獲取水晶前不能執行跳躍，即使距離遙遠，敵艦一直鎖定玩家除非用感應器解除鎖定。
>在前面6個回合的遊戲中，每回合會有一敵艦進入遊戲，放在玩家所在板塊的角落(勁敵一樣)，進入時不移動射程內才開火，敵艦的難度如下  1E2E3N4N5H6H但如果玩家的太空船在射程內會進行攻擊。

**任務4：搜索並摧毀  太空船起始速度：2   勁敵標記：5
目標：將6艘敵艦全部摧毀，並跳躍離開象限。衛星(水晶)不必被摧毀。
特別規則： 水晶代表敵人的防守衛星會一直鎖定玩家的太空船，如果成功牽引，衛星會被玩家控制。
>7.時，衛星會依照艦長的指示攻擊3格內的敵艦，傷害為骰出點數的一半，無條件進位，可以和玩家累加，衛星攻擊敵艦時，敵艦會鎖定玩家
◎注意：獎勵的特殊水晶無法在此任務中使用。

**任務5：母艦 太空船起始速度：2 勁敵標記：6
目標：摧毀黑帝斯並跳躍離開象限。
特別規則：敵艦會與水晶放在正中央，黑帝斯(hades)標記代表母艦，兩艘敵艦在母艦兩旁，黑帝斯護盾12，每有一個水晶被擷取護盾就減少3。

任務6：勁敵必須死 太空船起始速度：2 勁敵標記：4
目標：摧毀勁敵並跳躍離開象限。
特殊規則：
◎地圖板塊在起使設置時就已經全部被探索過了(全部在桌面上)
◎在前面兩個板塊的單一敵艦置於正中央的格子裡；第三格放置水晶與2艘敵艦(如同一般水晶放法)，水晶就代表逃生艙。
◎尚未鎖定玩家的敵艦會持續往救生艙前進，當敵艦已經移動到與救生艙相鄰，且未鎖定玩家時，會對救生艙造成一點的損壞。
◎如果在救生艙受到7點傷害時尚未用牽引光束營救成功，則救生艙被摧毀，任務失敗。
◎為了完成此階段的任務，玩家必須達成下列目標以贏得分數：
工程師engineering
▲1分－從工程板塊擺放獲得14能源
▲2分－從工程板塊擺放獲得14能源
(電池不算在能源裡，分數在步驟4時獲得)
護盾shields
▲1分－獲得10~12分的護盾分數
▲2分－獲得13分以上的護盾分數
(分數在步驟4時獲得)
跳躍jump
▲1分－在步驟8使5個骰子點數一樣
▲2分－在步驟8使5個骰子點數一樣，且沒有使用30秒的延長時間
◎每個工作站計算獲得的最高分數，一但獲得分數就可以持續使用，不會再失去。
◎如果總分數達3分以上，則太空船安置妥當，已具備摧毀勁敵的能力，此時擲骰以決定勁敵該如何被消滅

A curious co-op. You're not so much playing together working out how best to beat the system, but each playing your own little game as best as you can, and if everyone plays their mini-game well, then you win together. One plays Memory (to activate tractor beams), one plays Crokinole (to shoot weapons), one plays Potzblitz (to find stuff, a game I rated 1 by the way), one plays Robo Rally (to direct the ship) and so on. And everyone plays their mini-game in 30 seconds. Which is VERY quick, so the rush is on. And there are times within that 30 seconds that you have to change plans and give another crew member enough time to adjust as well. And the reason I say it's a curious co-op is if one player lets the team down by not performing well, you're all going down. And it's very obvious whose fault it is. Which obviously increases the chances of engendering a negative social experience, whereas most co-ops make it hard to allocate individual blame so as not to create negative social experiences. The mini-games are all trivial rated-1 type games, and the triviality of them is an issue for ongoing replayability, but the time pressure and inter-dependence make for a potentially fun time with the right crowd. I'm just not sure I want that level of responsibility and potential culpability in what's meant to be just a game.

Real-Time Coop game where the crew is on the bridge of a spaceship doing individual mini-games/duties together striving to survive and accomplish a mission. Takes over 2 hours. Very fun once everyone knows what to do. Intelligent design. Greater than the sum of it's parts. The most difficult game I've ever had to teach.

This is best for a group of people to play once week/month/season for dozens and dozens of sessions.

Designed to prevent the Alpha Gamer syndrome.

I'm kinda lukewarm on the game.  I mean, it's good.  I enjoy it.  But even though it's a real-time game, it takes much longer than it should.  Granted, we were socializing a bit more than the game intends, but it dragged on longer than it should have, in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't grok the hype for this title.  Teaching it was a bear because each mini-game has to be taught separately.  Then actual play took a super-long time with lots of downtime for others as the various mini-games resolve. We tried to get into the spirit of it, but by the end, it was a chore to finish.

I just realize how hard it is to give this game a game play weight. The mini games are ultra light, but it all comes together in a very complex way. It feels overly complex for the mini games or vice-versa overly light for the mission itself.
I just played this once and the game explanation clocked in over an hour. Still the things we did where to easy. I felt uncomfortable as some players hadn't anything to do throughout a few turns. So we worked through the mission for maybe three hours when our ship finally exploded.
I think Space Alert manages the frantic tension on a Space Ship much better.
The mini games felt to much like minigames and not like something thematic. So they have been a big let down for me.
I'd like to explore the missions, but I can't convince my group to try this again.
Overal verdict: minigame marathon which are connected by a space opera theme.

2 plays - This was one of the most tense games I've ever played. It is a real-time dice rolling, team vs team game, where you are maneuvering space ships in a duel to the death! 

It has the same 'ethos' of Captain Sonar with each person playing an integral part of a 'ship', but I think I prefer this.

I love the concept and many of the mechanics, but it's rather overcomplicated for what it's trying to do. Too hard to teach new players and not engaging enough to get back to the table often enough to remember the rules. The sequel (Dice Duel) is the better of the two, I think.

RATING: 8.5
Based on one play: A game that even non gamers will like even if it is two hours long. You play as member of a ship and each player,  within 30 must do their part to ensure the ship stays on course, defends itself, repairs and other tasks.  But each player gets a fun activity to do this,  such as a small game of memory, a puzzle or a game of speed, so the actions are a lot of fun to perform. It is not easy to win, but fun to play.

RATING: 6
This cooperative game "breaks the mold" of the coop games that we've seen for the past few years.  Each player has a role, but that role is highly specialized--players will be performing completely different tasks during the course of the game.  Furthermore, the task-performing period is timed, ensuring that players cannot help one another and must focus on their on job.  At the same time though, communication with your fellow players is essential, as you need to be able to decide how to play your role to best benefit the team.  The game encourages frantic teamwork among people doing very different things.

Quite a fun game, extremely reminiscent of the MMORPG Puzzle Pirates. Extremely. 

Everyone gets a duty station or two and has to perform critical ship functions within a 30-second time limit. Almost all the duty stations are fun and you need them all to survive the crazy missions the game sets up for you.

I played the final prototype at Gen Con 2012.

A co-operative game unlike others I've played, though it does have commonalities. In theme, it is very much like Space Alert. The players are the crew of a space ship trying to complete a specific mission. In Space Cadets, there are multiple scenarios with unique missions which should add re-playability.

Each player takes on a particular task. One person will be caption, another in charge of shields, a third person controlling weapons, etc. Each role has a unique game element associated with it, including spatial puzzles, dice rolling, programmed movement, dexterity games, and even a tactile sensory element. 

All of the elements are familiar, but they come together in a really unique experience, which is above all extremely fun. Because each person is solely responsible for a given task, and many tasks are simultaneous and timed, the bossy leader problem of some co-ops is alleviated to a great degree. Our game was filled with raucous laughter, shouts and groans. This will be an instant pre-order for me.

Fun but too many mechanisms and not enough anarchy, things go wrong because of a bad die roll or card draw and not the failings of the players. Poor communication between the players is rarely a factor.

Pretty amusing, as far as 5-6 player games go.

It does feel as though it starts to drag, after a while, though. The simplicity of the minigames begins to wear through when the sense of urgency starts to diminish.

Still fun with new players, and having to legitimately cooperate makes for some amusing interaction with your teammates~crew, especially when one or more of them pull a huge boner of a play that skews everyone else.

But really, it's just a handful of minigames glued together with a decent-- but not excellent-- series of themes and scenarios.

Unique, but not exceptional.

We do had a lot of fun with this game; although I think it won't hit the table very often - if you have these purely strategy-type players in your group, forget it. But with guys who are also open to RPGs, this can be a great game. It surely is an experience you shouldn't miss.

7 - Space Cadets is fun, but it's a very light-heavy game.  Each station is simple enough-grab tiles blindly, make blocks out of other blocks, or arrange icons into groups-but the pressure of only having 30 seconds to do all of that while everyone is shouting at the same time is where the real pressure comes in.  If you accidentally turn the ship left even though you meant right, you'll get extra damage which needs extra power which didn't happen because the engineer routed all power to the guns because you said that you needed to blow that ship up.  The game is insane and it is genius and you will die or run away unsuccessfully.

A game of failure, glorious and flaming, but not in a good way. Just constantly increasing danger with no way to improve your ability to handle it. Just trying to outrace a deathship while a bunch of other ships are already killing you. Awesome conceptually but not in execution.

5 Rating comes from 3 player game.  Really need more (thinking minimum of 5) for this game to really shine.  In essence it's 8 mini-games merged into a co-op game, but there's nothing wrong with that.  With 3 players, it feels like too much to keep track of from turn to turn (the Tractor Beam/memory game should not be that hard!).

Really wanted to like this game, and maybe it would be easier, smoother, and more fun with more experience... but I just can't see it being worth putting in that time and effort.

We played a four-person game, where I manned the weapons and engineering stations.  Ultimately it was kinda fun, but too complex, long, and fiddly for what seems like it should be a pretty light game with lots of shouting in silly accents about how the engines can't take much more of this, etc.

I was pretty good at the engineering station and half of the weapons station, but the other half, the little shuffleboard-type game, I was basically crap at.  This meant even though we were doing most things well (our captain kinda sucked at Concentration, though), that was all negated by an inability to hit anything with torpedoes.

The weapons station game is a problem, in that it's purely a manual dexterity task (and of a particular subset of manual dexterity most players won't have used since playing paper football in grade school).  This makes it unlike the other games, which are all mental tasks of some sort, with perhaps a minor manual dexterity element due to the time limit.

I doubt our game group is ever going to try this one again, because there are too many other options with a better fun-to-time spent ratio.

Individually, each mini-game collected here has a certain amount of charm but it may be important to change roles often, as I'm not sure about the lasting appeal of a single role. However, this game is really more about the sum of these parts, which come together to form quite a joyride. Plus, I always appreciate a game that actually knows how to set different difficulty levels based on player experience. When you beat the easy difficulty is exactly when you should be ready for normal, and so on.

Just make sure you prepare a large playing area, invest in some good ways to organize that game bits, and be patient with the rulebook. Learning to be a proper Cadet isn't quite as difficult as learning Space Alert, but a good player aid will keep things moving. 

Overall: There's plenty to love about Space Cadets if you're open to putting a little effort in!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Space Cadets is one of those games where the fun level all depends on who you are playing with.  I had a good bit of fun playing with my friends several times, but if you played with the wrong group I could really see this falling flat.

The mini games seem well designed for the most part.  Some are much harder than others (I am looking at you, Helm) which I suppose is inevitable.  

I will say that this game seems really difficult.  We played the first mission on Easy several times and got crushed each time.  Maybe we just suck, who knows.  We did laugh a lot, and that's important.

Overall, I liked Space Cadets.  It's unlike any other game in my collection.

Easily the most fun I've had playing a co-op game. Ever. Game 1 was amazing but we breezed through the first mission. Game 2 was much more challenging, though our drunk (IRL) helmsman was not much of a help when it comes to getting across the sector without driving through asteroids, rifts, and other Bad Things.

I can't wait to keep playing this bad boy. This thing has some great potential for expansions, too.

RATING: 6
Cooperative space game much like Space Alert but without the need for a recorded track.  Here players need to cooperate on fixed stations rather than move about to get various actions done.  The first few plays likely to be a bit slow feeling time constrained as players learn the ins and outs of each station.  But game will start to flow just in time to blow up the ship in a coordinated effort.

Needs a large table regardless of player number to hold all the various playmats and accessories.  The iOS app is very handy (just wish it had a bit more text as an option to help new players along).  Some interesting terminology that has to be learned (referring to a side of the ship as "shield" but don't confuse that with the shields and shield points.)

Still can suffer from one (or a few) players laying out each turn in the planning step and leaving a few players just to fill out their station which might not be as compelling of an activity for some.  Unlike Space Alert where players might be doing different things each turn, here one is doing the same task turn after turn which could become repetitive and less engaging as the game goes on.  The Switch Stations appears to be an attempt to mitigate this, but won't overcome strong personalities controlling the game.

Still an enjoyable romp, needs to played when and where players can be a bit raucous with a large table to really enjoy.  This conditions do knock down my rating to the "if in the right mood" rating of 6 rather than a "usually" rating of 7.

a neat coop game, where each player has a different mini-game specialty.

update: The very mishmash nature of the game that gives it a distinctive appeal is also its downfall.  For any given part of the game (flicking, real time coordination, sci fi coop) there is another game that does it better.  Being second best at everything doesn't make the cut in my collection.

--Jul2013-- Quite a cute co-op, all things concerned.  Its difficulty level is reasonable, and the sub-puzzles amusing.  But it's a bit too hard (at least the Helmsman role is!) for son #2, so I'll likely confine my play to daughter #1 and her friends.

I had quite a bit of fun with this after the learning curve.  We played an easy mission and it was a fight to the end.

I like nearly all the mini games, though some seem too simple compared to others...  With a player ceiling of 6 I liked the complexity and the pay off of strategy and luck.

Ok, we played the game the third time yet and finally we rocked mission one. But still it was very chewy ... I think because half of the group didn't comply with the time restrictment in the discussion phase. Properly speaking you have to run through the phases and only discuss in the discussion phase (who had thought this?).
I love the theme and for a "Space Alert" fan you just have to be hot for this one!

My biggest criticism of this game is how hard it is to teach. It's very hard to convince people that this game will be fun and fast paced and funny when you spend nearly an hour teaching each different person a minigame or two or three, then trying to explain who does what when. Then trying to explain the actual map and goals. It definitely pays off though, this game is hilarious. That said, for real time games I almost always go for Escape Curse of the Temple instead, much easier to actually get to the table.

I really enjoyed Space Cadets as a co-op game. It tries to solve the problems most co-op games have by making everyone work on their own mini-games making it harder for one player to take over. The only problem is that more often than not certain stations are unused. This doesn't happen if you have a group of experienced players, but the first couple of games can just be awful for some of the stations. The game also seems to take a really long time for how simple all of the stations are.

I am reserving judgement though until we play at a tougher level ...

Seems pretty awesome so far. Need to try it 6-player, as I think it will be more fun now that I know the rules, and with a full team of people (so there is not a split phase 3). I like that everyone has a task, but depending on the way energy is given out, some people have nothing to do on some turns (weapons officer for example) which kind of sucks. This probably doesn't happen often though in full missions, so I need to play more.

Gameplay is really fun, all the minigames are interesting, and the components get the job done.  I am eager to see what repeated plays with the same group is like.

I wanted to love it ... but I guess it wasn't quite right for me.  It just seemed to go a bit long.  Love the concept and ideas, but two hours of flicking a disc or doing a mini-puzzle just wasn't engaging enough.  Plus, there are turns that some folks won't be doing anything.  Maybe if everyone could do ALL of their turns at the same time, it would speed it up.  There was a lot of downtime and that's the part I wish would go away.

This is a fun co-op and does give the sense of flying a starship collectively. I like how everyone has their own mini-game they are all doing together. Still, the game itself is really challenging and the gameplay seems long such that I'm not sure it's something I'd like to play often.

This game really evokes its theme well.  Sensors, navigation, engineering...even though the activities are simple in concept, they are quite tense with the timer going.  This game is about as fiddly as a bluegrass festival, though, with a gazillion pieces to pass out.  I don't think there's another game quite like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  At first all I knew about it was that it was a cooperative game with each player controlling a piece of a star-ship but as it was unpacked I became very skeptical since each of these pieces seemed to boil down to a simple mini-game (a Ubongo-style puzzle, a memory game, feeling around in a bag for a specific shaped piece, etc.).

Once played with the time-limit though this game came to life.  Some players have multiple pieces they have to control at the same time and even though each piece is a simple little mini-game you only have 30 seconds to consider what you need to do, try and work out what you're doing in conjunction with your teammates, and actually get it done.  Not to mention once your ship is damaged (which doesn't seem that uncommon) you have to do damage control (which requires playing another matching mini-game that involves passing the deck around among all the players in the same 30 seconds or you outright lose!).

All that tension turns this game into a break-neck adventure that I had a blast with.  I do think this game has an expiration date as with multiple plays you will become more skilled in these mini-games and inevitably be able to complete them in less time eliminating the tension that makes this game fun.  There are "advanced" options for almost all of the stations that might breathe a little extra life in the game once you reach that point though.

With multiple plays a couple other things have become apparent to me, some negative and some positive.  The negative things being a. that it doesn't actually take that long to get bored with the mini-games.  Sometimes you have nothing to do, which I knew was a possibility if you don't get energy either because you don't need it or engineering wasn't able to make you a match.  It's still crappy to have to sit around for a round while everyone else is playing even if you can help out as a communication link (and if there is a core breach chances are you still have something to do).  But even beside that the games are very simple and just can't hold my attention for long so even when I do have stuff to do I'm having less fun.  And b. I thought when it got to that point that at least the advanced options for each station would renew some of its luster.  Well, they don't really.  They're a neat little addition but that's just it, they are a very little addition.  Usually just a different option that you use by playing the same simple, uninteresting mini-game and most of the effects aren't that powerful or interesting.

The one positive thing I'll say about the game that I didn't quite realize at first is that the game does have a decent amount of variability outside of the actual mini-games you play.  There are a bunch of different missions plus fan-made ones or you can come up with your own.  The game system allows for a decent amount of options so there's a decent amount of variety of how you can play it.  But to bring it all back, you still play it with the same mini-games...

RATING: 6
I love the idea of the game and want to love it - however despite each mini system being quite simple the whole is quite complex. Which made my one play drag. I had imagined that the timer would impose a fast paced game but it did not feel like it. Also I think it might work best if gamers play into the roles - treat it like the bridge of the Enterprise. It might work even better with out decision by committee- I.e a stern authoritarian Captain.

Create a master plan together - strategic mastery to outwit the enemy and collect the precious crystals. "We'll fly round this asteroid and show our port side. Full shields there and then blast the enemy with 3 torpedos. Finally tractor beaming the crystal and charging the jump drive for home. Piece of piss."
Shield officer, weapons officer, helm, sensors - they all get on with their own 30 second mini game to carry out that plan. 
Then all will look up to discover what a mess you've created. 
Charging through the asteroid instead of past it? Showing the enemy the one side of ship where you have no shields. The weapons officer might only get one torpedo loaded and then totally miss the shot. Engineering probably gives power to the toilet block instead of the engines. The tractor beam, well that probably didn't even come on. Well at least sensors got a lock on him...
The distribution of failure and success is exactly where this game feels great.
We never complete a mission when we play this. We always seem to manage to avoid death and escape with the ship falling apart - but collecting all the crystals? That's not a challenge that my crew are up to. 
Celebrate your mediocrity!

First time playing space cadets and we lost horribly, but had a lot of fun. This is definitively a game to learn, it takes a bit of time till one is competent with all the stations, so I would assume it makes more sense to play it with a fairly consistent group - too many beginners at the same table makes it hard to win, though everyone still gets to have a proper go at their challenge and there did not seem to be much chance of having a run-away leader. I would very happily play this again, but think it would not hit the table often enough to purchase it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is really unique. A big part of the co-op "Leader" problem is eliminated cause everyone has his one task. Sure, some of the minigames are very simple, but i appreciate that. Even in the beginner scenario the game is really hard to beat...imagine the minigames are hard to master...no one would survive the first enemy attack. On the other side the minigames are only a part of the game. In the preparation phase you have to think about which stations you want to activate (under time pressure). So there could be a small leader problem again...but this is bearable compared to other co-op games.

Two minor complaints: There are a couple of rules, so it is not that easy to teach the game to new gamers (what i hoped). Sure, everyone only has to know how his own station works and can learn the other mechanics while playing. But it takes time to teach everyone their station (although the videos give a hint..thanks for that)
And second the components, although i really like them, are medicore. My timer goes 30 seconds in one direction and 26 in the other (my last jump attempt was boycotted by this jerk). The mats for the stations and the space tiles are very thin. I am afraid they will not survive many games.

Besides those two issues we had a very good time with the game everytime we played it. I am really looking forward to the IOS-app. Rating may rise :)

Edit: Rating now a shiny 10 :-) Soooo much fun

I enjoyed this.  It was tense and exciting.  It was also a little long for what it is, but our win with a smoking, shambling mess of a ship left me feeling very satisfied.  There are some rough edges that could use smoothing out, and not all stations are equally fun, but I'd certainly play some more.  Teaching this game is kind of rough.

Part way thorough my first play, I was the captain and we were talking energy allocation and what we had to do next, and I just sat back with a beaming smile on my face. That conversation alone made the game more than worth the purchase price. We go so involved in it, we were almost acting out our parts.

Much fun, but not nearly as good as dice duel, the team v. team was actually better than this full co-op.  The mini games are really cool, and a great idea to combo up for a full game.  I was kinda stuck as the Captain so didn't have too much to do, and even in my thing to do had help from others.  I would like to try a few more of the positions and see if this changes.  I liked the timing aspect, really put the pressure on.

RATING: 5
I wanted to like this, and there's a part of me that thinks this is different and potentially fun enough to be worth getting, but I realize I'm probably deluding myself.
At it's core, this is players playing a bunch of 30 second mini games. While some are fun (Robo-rallyish ship navigation), several aren't terribly exciting and some are downright dull (memory match...whee). There's very little theme and very little actual cooperation. There's also almost no 'choices' to be made. You try to solve the puzzle in 30 seconds. That's it. No decisions, no creative ways to tackle a problem.
This takes a painfully long time to teach, especially compared to the amount of gameplay in the game. It also runs long to play, mostly due to all the overhead of preparing for each phase.
While the gameplay is completely different, it's hard not to compare it to Space Alert. And Space Alert blows away Space Cadets on every possible level. Space Alert is more immersive and thematic, has deeper and more challenging gameplay, takes less time to teach and play, and can play with only 1 or 2 players.

Fresh air in co-operative games. You don`t play all together, but everyone has his own mini game. So there is no leader, who will say what everyone should do. 

The problem is the mini games are not so interesting. For example we have a mini ubongo, or mini memory. The other thing when you are concentrate on your own goal, you don`t feel the team play. So it is a co-operative game where everyone plays for itself.

Solid cooperative game that is a lot of fun, especially because of the large player count (you should be playing this with the maximum number of players). It almost felt more like a party game. The fact that it's a cooperative game that sidesteps the typical alpha-gamer problem is a welcomed innovation (although, didn't Wok Star do this too?). The mini-games are unique enough to make switching roles interesting, and yet straightforward enough to make playing this with a mixed age group a possibility. I'm not a huge co-op game fan, but the theme of Space Cadets certainly won me over. We had a few harrowing moments where we were all convinced that we were going to explode in a ball of flames -- and this was only the easy setting!

On the other hand, I have a few concerns. First, there are a lot of rules to manage, especially on your first play. This will obviously be less of a problem on subsequent plays, but we were constantly consulting the rulebook and discovering things that we weren't doing quite right. I also thought that, despite the quantity of rules, the mini-games felt repetitive over the course of the game. Switching roles helps, and maybe we should have done that more freely, but I also suspect that people will want to stay at a station once then feel comfortable with the rules of it's mini-game. In our game, we did switch roles, but typically only at the minimum required rate. Finally, depending on the demands of the particular game state, it will happen that certain players may have nothing to do for a turn or two.

Overall, the thematic feel of the game is great. We were laughing the whole time. But I don't see playing Space Cadets on a regular basis. It's instead solidly in the category of "raucous fun time, but only once in a while."

Update:  Dropped from a 9 to an 8.  Despite how much I love playing this game, it has been hard to get other people into it.  There are a lot of rules and the game takes longer than I feel it should.  However, I'm really looking forward to SC: Dice Duels!

Despite the great amount of hype behind this game, I've been skeptical of the concept, seeing it as a bunch of loosely connected mini-games. Having played it, though, the theme comes through much better than I expected.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Conrad

Why we culled it: This was my very first Secret Santa gift from BGG, 2012. And I'm still somewhat ashamed that it was never played once between then and the first culling, in July of 2017. The game looks great, like a very accessible table-top implementation of a game like Artemis. The 3+ player requirement was a major hurdle for us, as was the fairly child-puzzle nature of the game when trying to lure in my theme-first space buddies. As such, I realized that it needed a better home. I believe I found it a good one, and I hope to get invited to a session once it finds a stride. Good times.

I like this more than anyone that I play it with.  People find it to be overly complicated for what it is.
I just love playing the little stations, but there's probably too much for the weapons guy to do.  Nearly all the other stations rely on weapons doing well and if he's bad at dexterity games (or if all of you kinda are) then you're basically screwed.
Honestly, damage control is a bit much and makes the game too difficult to deal with.  The game is hard enough as it is to worry about all this damage that simply repairing might damage you further.
I know this is all negative, but I really do love playing it and all of the stations are fun to play in my opinion.

I'm still not a fan of co-ops, but this one at least is successful in removing the dominant player issues seen in most. The problem I have is that the theme makes no sense at all when paired with the actions most players take (which involves solving puzzles for the most part). I'm trying to figure out why someone loading torpedos would be playing a game of tetris to decide how many get loaded. It just makes no sense.

This is definitely a fun game.  There are a ton of moving parts here, but the designer did a good job of keeping everything moving in a general direction that makes sense.

Space Cadets is very interesting in the respect that it actually seems to play better with more players.  As each person assumes ship functions, the process becomes somewhat cleaner and less fiddly.

The built in threat of a nemesis that warps into the sector and tries to blast you from the stars is a good one.

I'm eager to try this out again; it is a lot of fun.

[thing=123096][/thing] is a chaotic cooperative game in which players take a role of a Bridge Officer in the spaceship - each one has a different way of playing involving some sort of mini-game:

- Helmsman - uses cards (the quantity comes from the speed the ship is) to set the course of the ship (much like pre-set your movement as in [thing=18][/thing]);
- Engineer - must combine tiles with symbols in order to fuel energy to the many parts of the ship;
- Weapons Officer - must complete puzzles (like the ones in [thing=16986][/thing]) in order to have torpedoes to use, them, to use these torpedoes, he must flick a disc in a track in order to see how much damage it will do;
- Shield Officer - uses poker hands to determin the strenght of each of the four shields;
- Sensor Officer - must find, with only the touch, the correct piece that match the one in the cards, in order to set locks on targets (this is enhance the damage of the torpedoes, and allows the tractor beam to pull things);
- Captain - has some special cards for dire moments, while also sets and help others do their jobs;
- Tractor beams - uses a memory game in order to pull things;
- Jump - roll the dice in order to achieve some goals set in the cards - if you do, you take the card, that allows, to change somewhat the result of the dice, and this will help, in the end, for the ship to jump to safety.

Everyone has 30 seconds to do his thing in the best way possible.

The game is scenario driven so things can change, but in the first scenario you have to collect 3 crystals, and to do this, you must navigate the ship through the space, avoiding the meteor belts and gas clouds, while keeping a safe distance from enemies ships. If these ships lock on the the one of the players, it starts to move in the direction of it, and then will shoot. The damage is usually the result of a die (or dice) roll and will hit the part of the ship facing the direction of the shot. If the shields don't hold, everything that passes is damage, and thus the cards from that part are revealed and their effects enter in play. If there aren't more cards, the core is breached, and the players now must, while also doing their job, to match cards of the core, or the whole thing will explode (and game over).

I found the game lackluster - none of the mini-games are really great, and maybe the fun comes from the chaos in the table, as everyone is doing his stuff and hoping everyone is also doing theirs. But I played with only 2 others, so the game was way more quiet than it can be - in some turns, only two of the three had actions to be made. I friend of mine called [thing=123096][/thing] a smoke and mirrors sort of game - one in which you can't really pay close attention to it, or it will fall apart as nothing more than small party tricks. This is spot on. The game surely requires chaos, shouts and a big number of players (5 or 6) in order to shine. For us it was just OK.

The game can be fun, but more to do with the group then with the game itself. I can't see why I would play this over [thing=38453][/thing]. But I would be willing to play it again, but only in with almost the full compliment of players.

Ugggg.  Brutally long for minimal reward.  Teaching out is a pain.  Rulebook is difficult to navigate, components are sub-par.  

Too bad, because concept is cool, and thematically it's fun to take on your part of the "enterprise"...  The game is unique as You are responsible for a certain function of the ship.  Ummm,  until you have to switch.  They probably added this eventually in the design process, because someone said,  "You know... I'm getting a bit bored trying to find shapes in a bag" or "well I like shooting the missles,  but I get one opportunity every 20 minutes".  

The game is Over-complicated for no reason.  It could have been streamlined and shortened.  You can come up with some house rules I assume, but with soooo many better games out there.... Why?   

You really have to play a "teaching" game for all players to grasp the concepts of their role and how they all integrate together.

Bottom Line:  Frustrating, and to be honest I am shocked some of the top reviewers have such high praise for this debacle.

My Thoughts after the 5 1/2 hour ruined gaming night after a failed attempt and a reset, and in the second game attempt on normal and a player leaving and being replaced before we perished a crystal away from victory. - ."I felt like I just was on a bumpy ride in the back of a bus for 6 hours, I feel like I want to throw up"

UPDATE:  There are some tutorial apps available, and an App that goes through each phase and timed rounds to use during the game.   If you have someone who has played it before - the learning curve can be less - but do not try to learn while you teach.  PLAY THE TUTORIAL FIRST!! (even if you are experienced gamers, it will make first game more enjoyable). - Need experienced gamers, This game needs to be played 2-4 times to start to be enjoyable. So if you are one who doesn't own a lot of games, and wants to really invest in the long term, you may really enjoy it.  Each game is approx 2 hours.   One last note, the game can get laggy waiting for you assignment at times with 5-6 players.   

Good Luck...  Geez, I am talking so much about this one, maybe I should move off a ranking of 3.  (went from 2-3 at least)   I think I just want to make sure players are warned going in.  I wish someone had done this for me, maybe I wouldn't have so much disdain, and a bad taste in my mouth from it.

I'm stunned when reading the comments of the guys who rated it poor(ly). I can certainly imagine this game is not for everyone. But how can you think this is a "bad, bad, bad" game? I have to admit that there really are a lot of small (and sometimes a little annoying) rules - which prolly doesn't make it a 10 for me. But the idea is great and deserves at least a 5 by itself. And if you think it's DUMB minigames, you just miss the point.

I got excited about the idea, got the game and played it once so far (not rated yet because of that). Still excited to play it again (and again) and get better at it.

The prospect of having a game that's interesting while non-gamers can participate and have fun as well is attractive.

Good fun on your mission!

Outstanding design.  Strongly reminiscent of "Puzzle Pirates" transmuted into a space-themed boardgame.  Clever, thematically-appropriate minigames for stations makes everyone's performance relevant, neatly sidestepping "Alpha Player Syndrome".  Strong interdependencies between stations makes for frenzied communication and necessitates teamwork.  One of the best implementations of cooperative gameplay I've ever seen.

And it's playable by grognards and 7-year-olds alike, at the same table.

Unique game, for sure - I don't know anything like this, so bonus points for that!

Other than that, I'm not too found of the game. It takes AGES to explain the rules and do the setup. There are ~8 different games here which all tie together in rather complicated way. Our first game took 3h+ without rule explanation(and we exploded, so we were not close to finish it by winning). Rules explanation took 1-1,5h... and the game is quite light and random! That's always veeery problematic combo.

This is a lot of fun, and doesn't suffer from the bossy leader problem that most cooperative games have. Although the minigames themselves are not too intersting, the intense amount of pressure and the way everything fits together so well make for a unique and immersive experience. As the weapons expert, I was great at the puzzle solving, easily solving 3 puzzles each round, but being horrible at dexterity games, I barely managed to destroy a few meager enemies. This didn't keep me from enjoying the game at all though, and everyone thought it was hilarious. The core breach added more tension into the game in an interesting way. I wish they had made repair a minigame, though. Still a great game, though. This is what I was expecting Space Alert to be like.

A little more American-style, dare I say Ameritrash, than I was expecting. The game is fiddly by Euro standards, but well thought out. It can't really flow until everyone has a decent grip on the rules. There is also definitely a learning curve - newbies will have a hard time winning. The shield station seems especially hard (but then I don't play poker). I am optimistic that we'll have fun playing this with our friends. (26 Dec 2012)

RATING: 4.5
Not a horrible game, but it has some pretty significant problems. 

The biggest one is that it is far, far too long for what it is, the smaller and intro scenarios are still running over 3 hours easy. 

Other issues: 
Some jobs/minigames are far more fun or interesting or less stressful for the time allotted than others; even when taking into account personal preferences and differing skill sets, some of the activities are significantly less enjoyable especially given the highly repetitive nature of the game play.  
The game play is very repetitive, it can easily be a fun hour long game packed into 3+ hours of time.
Far too easy to have turns where no progress (towards winning or losing) is made.  A couple bad turns for one player can significantly extend how long the game runs for all involved. 
Potential for luck (one or two rolls) to significantly impact or even dominate the outcome of the game.

Really enjoyable sort of party-style co-op.  Lots of franticness and panic and just the right amount of difficulty.  I never fully understood the complaints about how long it takes to teach when each station is very simple, but after playing it there were a lot of fringe rules and clarification needed on little details and how certain things interact.

RATING: 7
Fun game, lots of mini-games.  Confusing, chaotic, high energy - almost like a beer and pretzels game but it has more strategy than that describes.  Good co-op game where each person really does their thing without the other players telling them what to do.

RATING: 6
A decent cooperative game, but it has a tendency to overstay its welcome.  Some of the jobs are simply much more difficult, and some comparatively easy.  The gameplay lacks a bit of drama as well.  For the right groups, though, I think this would be a big hit.  The real-time aspect and differing minigames is unique.

Good design.  A coop where there are 6 mini games going on each round.   I am not a huge coop fan, otherwise this rating would be higher.

Could be great if played frequently with a regular group. However, as a casual game with new players it is too complicated, too messy, too long.

Incredibly challenging, we've yet to win a mission at this one. Our ultimate co-op game. Which might explain why we haven't won yet actually.

RATING: 7
Stupid, chaotic, cooperative fun. The mechanics complement the theme so nicely- it feels very much like you are on a semi-competent crew, pinballing around the galaxy.

It's so difficult to achieve anything you intend to that it feels an enormous success when you do.

It's not a well-designed game and the rules are not always easy to remember, but it mostly doesn't seem to matter in terms of actually enjoying the game.

Co-operative game, where each player is playing a small minigame or a few.

RATING: 5
The idea of this is great, a crew of 5 or 6 people playing a bunch of different puzzle solving and dexterity based mini-games to simulate different stations on a starship. In practice though, I have found most of the mini-games to be sort of dull and the central meta-game to be hard to follow and extremely fiddly.

A lot of people really love this one though, so maybe I'm missing something. It might just be that I don't own it, so I'm not tracking well on the objectives and mechanisms of the main game. Still, it feels kind of boring, regardless of whether or not I'm following what's going down on the main board.

Coordinated puzzle and dexterity mini games to coordinate the functioning of a spaceship navigating through space missions and blowing raiders into space dust.  Raucous silly fun. I like the fog of war aspect where objectives are placed on the table and modular board tiles are revealed as you explore towards those objectives. Shift change is a great way to keep all players involved and adds good chaos. We have the Space Duel version but both played distinctly different. This game has different types of mini-games, Space Duel is just dice based.

Quite a nicely designed cooperative space exploring game.  Everyone has their own roles and little dexterity type challenges to perform to do their part of each turn.  It is quite frantic, and lots of fun.

I won a copy, happily received it, punched the bits that didn't come free during shipping. Read the instructions to the gang and it was universally decided that it wasn't going to get played. So, with the exception of a rule book that got a little time with a six month old by accident, it is a new game.

Good family game. The first game takes a little while to understand all of the different jobs but it should go much faster the next time. 30 seconds goes really fast. Worth playing at least once.

First impression, 3p (me at Captain and Engineering, two 7-year-olds covering all other stations on a training mission):  This seems to be everything I hoped, if having a little more complex a learning curve than I might've expected for a bunch of minigames.  I can see that if your Weapons officer or Helm officer are miserable at their jobs, this could get frustrating quickly, as you pray for a Station Change.  Fortunately, that card is — cleverly enough — a damage card in each of the four locations, so if officer ineptitude leads to damage, change cometh….
⋮
Alright!  Now we played a vaguely 7p game, with people coming and going from their stations, and others covering, but we finished the first training mission.  Woo!  This is definitely fun.  You live or die by your Weapons officer, though, so make sure you get a good flicker in that role.  A good enough flicker only needs to be able to complete one torpedo tube puzzle in order to be effective; however, if you can crank out four, and still make most of your flicks effective, the odds of mission success will rise dramatically.

Like all the real-time games (see above: Space Alert), this game depends on the group.  If you're all having a good time and chucking, it's great.  If you've got more serious gamers, I'd leave it on the shelf.  I had a good time.

There's an iPad app that helps track the various stages of the game.  I wouldn't even attempt to play the game without it.  (It replaces the sand timer, which really makes things work better and eases the tedium of the captain role.)

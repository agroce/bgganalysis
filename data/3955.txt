Pretty much unplayable. That the game depends on symbols and looking up individual cards in the rulebook instead of just writing text on the cards themselves completely ruins what may have otherwise been a barely decent take-that game.

Bang is an average game, and when compared to similar bluffing games like The Resistance or Werewolf, it just doesn't stand up. The game takes too long, has unbalanced roles, tries to be strategic and bluff-based simultaneously and tends to fail on both fronts, as the cards can create a luck based game. Although the strategy is certainly there, and mitigates some luck, it is an inherently a highly imperfect game that tends to languish in my collection.

fab game easy to pick up ,plays quick an you don,t have to "read" the cards they have symbols on so you know what they do.
the "dodge city" expansion is a must and two smaller expansion ;
"fistful of dollars" 
"high noon" hard to get now

RATING: 6
Party card game that is essentially a "take that!" game, with a very strong theme, an excellent bluffing aspect, and role selection/variable character powers.

This game is going to work very well for beginners and/or large groups (scales from 3-8 with expansions, which I strongly recommend, particularly "Dodge City"), keeping in mind that it's almost non-existent strategy, but rather quick, fun, and very replayable filler material.

One negative is that players are often and easily killed off early, and this leaves them with literally nothing to do until the game ends, which although is generally quick, can occasionally drag.

On the plus side, aside from the replayability due to variety in changing characters and roles, this game has both competitive and co-operative elements to it (the outlaws can win together, the deputies can win with the sheriff), and a nice bluffing element to it, which is where most of the strategy lies.  I've heard complaints about the Renegade never winning, and yet some of my best games have been when I've bluffed my way through the entire game as a deputy only to turn around and kill the sheriff and, sometimes his real deputy, at the end of the game- surprise!  Worth the small amount of money it's going to cost you to buy.

Own the [boardgame=9653]Dodge City[/boardgame], [boardgame=66508]Wild West[/boardgame], [boardgame=107794]Gold Rush[/boardgame], [boardgame=130046]Valley of Shadows[/boardgame], [boardgame=8269]High Noon[/boardgame], and [boardgame=20237]Fistful of Cards[/boardgame] expansions, and the [boardgame=217972]Bloody Mary[/boardgame] promo card.  Dodge City, Wild West and Gold Rush are must haves, the other two don't get much use, but have the potential to spice up the base game in the future.

Bang is not my cup of tea at all. I've heard the Dice game is better but I dislike the original so much I'm fairly confident that it won't be saved by a dice version. This one is in my hall of shame, next to Trajan (:devil:), Munchkin, and Fluxx.

There's a lot of game in such a small deck. I've only played the 4-player game... I can see it getting better and better the more people you add in! The player elimination aspect kind of stinks though, and I could see it being more of an issue with more players. UPDATE: I am more annoyed at the way one player always seems to get screwed over in this game. I suppose that if we would play it really fast it wouldn't matter so much, but in 5 or so plays that has not occured. UPDATE: sold for GG.

I do like this game. The atmosphere is nice if played with the right crowd. Surely, it's luck driven and characters & roles and not balanced. Nevertheless, it is fun to play and has an excellent replayability. You could compare it to games such as Munchkin but the secret roles and characters makes for a better game in my opinion. I would recommend Bang! if you're into Spaghetti Western movies.

Different characters and different game setting depending on total # of players make each game unique.  

I love games with variable player powers.

Downside(s): Some rules are confusing.  Only a fun game with a large # of players (this may be an upside for some, but I have a hard time finding this large of a number of sufficiently geeky people to play with).

I only played once, but had a terrible time.

The amount of muchkining that goes on is nuts, the art is confusing, and the pace is really jilted. Several times throughout the game, I'd hit a run of drawing cards that at best prolonged my life, and at worst were completely useless.

I threw caution to the wind early on, revealing my role so that I could be killed and exit the game, but somehow ended up surviving almost all the way to the win.

I finally got to play this game at The Cast are Dice and had an absolute blast!  It did help that I won - as the Sheriff - and what's more no-one took a single shot at me, despite the fact that the game lasted 40 mins and everyone was shooting everyone else.
Mind you, I did have a really good character to go with the role, and the fact that no-one shot at me made it really hard to spot who wasn't the Deputy, which was a balancing factor.

The game plays out EXACTLY like I thought that it would from reading the rules - and I wasn't the least bit disapponted.  I had a lot of fun and that was what I expected.  It is a great game to play in a group of 6 or 7 and perfect for getting out with the right crowd at Christmas.  The only problem is that you can be eliminated early on and that can be a drag...but you gotta love this game anyway!

Nice little game of secrets and revenge. It can be vicious, regularly some players won't even get a turn, but works well for larger groups. The cards are poorly designed though - lots of them require constant references to the rulebook. Odd since other cards have their abilities printed on them.
Don't play this game with anyone who is too sensitive or serious.

Different roles determines the different objectives to win the game. Sheriff must eliminate all outlaws and renegades. Deputy helps the sheriff with his mission. The outlaws tries to kill the sheriff. And the renegade must kill everyone else except the sheriff and be the last one standing between the him and the sheriff.

With different characters to choose from, there'll be different special abilities. Shoot by playing the 'Bang' card and to not be hit, play the 'Mancato' card. Drink beer to replenish life.

Awesome game! Anything can happens. Sheriff may kill his deputy, therefore losing everything he has. Outlaw may kill his member just to get bonus cards.

Love being the renegade...

This game can't decide if it is a filler or a serious game.  The amount of different rules drove me crazy.

RATING: 7
A fun card game.  What could be better than reenacting wild west fights between deputies and outlaws with cards?  Half the fun is not knowing who has which role (except for the Sherriff, who is declared).  I like this one, though I think some of the win conditions (which are role-based) are a little bit tough.  Last man standing vs. kill all the bad guys vs. don't let the Sheriff die?  In my opinion, better with more people though also a bit more confusing and crazy (which is, of course, more fun!).

Rating lowered from 8 to 7.  A good game, but not one I look to play.  The game mechanics leave me feeling like gameplay is random and hard to control.  For me, there is less emphasis on figuring out other people's roles and achieving your goal than just doing things to see what happens.

Amazingly fun and addictive.  An excellent light game to play after something heavy, or to start out the evening.

It has been described, by people in my group, as "Werewolf with Strategy" or as "Lunch Money with structure".  It feels to me like a mx of those games, taking the best of each and combining them.  My only small quibble is that the outlaws have a significant advantage, and win much more than the sherrif team.  This is much less so in a game with an odd number of players....I recommend playing with 5 players, as that is the best number.  7 is pretty good but too long, and too long between turns.  Below 5, it is less interesting.

Players can take up different roles: Sherif, Deputy, Outlaw and Renegade.  Only the identity of the Sherif is exposed while the rest secretly helps or plots against the sherif.

The deputies are to help the sherif to kill all the outlaws, outlaws' goal are to kill the sherif.  The renegade aims to kill all the rest of the players.

All players by default can only shoot the person beside them till they get better guns or weapons.  There are other cards like the beer to refill the hearts of a character, general store and many more others.

Good points: This is a semi-cooperative games which players of the same interest cooperate with each other.  Game is fun with a rowdy group of players.

Bad points: When 1 player dies without the game ending, he cannot be revived.  Player will have to wait for the game to end before starting another round.  During this time the player might be bored as he is not participating in the game.

RATING: 5
Lots of fun to play with the right group. Plays best with 5 or 7 players. The downside it is a player elimination game but this is glossed over by the quick play (20 - 30 minutes). The major drawback of the game is that more often than not it takes a few turns to figure out who some of the players are. But during that time it's not uncommon for one or more players to be killed. In fact, it's possible to die in this game before you even take a turn. Occasionally it will take a new player a little while to figure out just what is really going on (figuring out which role each player has) but it's still fun. Player who over analyze will really slow this game down. Bang is best played as a fast, lite game. Luckily Shadow Hunters is almost the same game but adds a way to help you figure out who is who.

For those who enjoyed playing "cowboys&Indians" as a kid. A lot of fun, even when shouting out the Italian on the cards rather than the English ("MANCATO!" just sounds so much more dramatic than "missed").Bang is definitely a game for a large group of people, or else the sherrif just becomes a target. The artwork is a little drab and a little on the unclear side.

I liked the interaction between the players, but the language-independant nature of the cards created some confusion about the way symbols combined. Those darn +1/-1 horses are very confusing.  Fun, though, especially when there's a good bit of bluffing going on.

Bang has a lot of fun ideas with variable roles and goals for every player, but... eh.

For one thing, the player elimination is random and annoying. The different things you can actually do with your cards aren't incredibly interesting. And everything seems slightly more convoluted than it needs to be for what should be a simple game.

Excellent implementation of the Spaghetti Western feeling in a party/deduction game with player elimination. I prefer it to Night Hunters for example (which is another popular of the genre) due to the fact that it can be a lot more strategic and love the theme of the Wild West. The downtime is that it might drag a bit sometimes or people might get eliminated too early but that's due to the nature of gunfighting. After all it's funny even to be on the table talking with the others. It surely depends on your playing companions. It get's better with Dodge City and we play with the tournament rules for scoring and always with Spaghetti Western music in the backgroung when playing!

RATING: 6
Some interesting decisions to be made, with hefty doses of bluffing.  Another decent "1-step away from a gateway game," and plays with 6, which is nice.  Tends to be difficult to teach, due to the symbols on the cards, and also runs a little long from time to time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Low quality production that caused a lot of confusion. Game play was surprisingly slow and tedious compared to what one would expect, because even though the choices you are given don't really matter in the long run, you're still given some and that's still enough to bog things down in a large group if you have one or two people who have to have a mental debate about what to do. (And you only want to play this with a big group.)

The dice game improved the experience by cleaning up the rules and removing choice. (Not that this makes it a good game, but at least it goes faster.)

Bought this for quick play for slightly larger groups, but didn't really seem to excite anyone at our holiday in Avignon. Lots of luck, easily becomes unbalanced, new players can be eliminated almost immediately and have to watch the rest of the game from the sidelines, which doesn't always enamour them of the game. It can also sometimes play longer than it is welcome. But not horrible for an occasional play.

Traded away.

At best, a brisk romp that encourages table talk and generates its share of table-wide tension. At worst, a dry, boring slog spent waiting for indecisive or timid players. Without active pressure from all involved, tends to devolve into the latter.

I'm becoming increasingly annoyed by this game (and reluctant to play it). It's easy to find situations like being eliminated, with no fault on your part, within the first few turns; spend several turns in a row in which you do nothing, and so on. It's not that victory is random, something I can live with, but the amount of fun you can have is also random, even no fun at all in some games. My rating has gone through major downgrading in the last months.

Fun party game if the sheriff loses. However it can get a little long if everyone gets killed but the sheriff and the renegade, while everyone else is just watching. It has a lot of symbols that can intimidate and confuse non gamers.

RATING: 7
This game is good, and the only real gripe I have against it that prevents me from rating it any higher is the elimination mechanic, combined with the relatively long playtime of each game. I've seen games where a player is eliminated before his first turn even comes around, and the game proceeds to last another hour plus.

Fun, but too long for how random it is (or too random for how long it is).  Few meaningful decisions, lots of downtime, especially if you get knocked out early or spend a lot of time in Jail.  Still, for some reason, I can't manage to rate it lower than 7.

People love it or hate it.  It's possible to die before taking a turn and still be a part of the winning side.  But if you're good and roleplaying, bluffing, and feeling lucky, kid, then this game is perfect for friends looking to trashtalk.

Oh how this game fell from grace. I loved it at first but dealt with the frustration of never having the right cards or being able to do ANYTHING except draw when it was my turn and wait for the right card to win or lose. I can't take it anymore. One friend who's played with us on occasion mentioned he didn't like it because "He's played 3 times and in 2 of those he was dead before he got to do anything."

Looking for a good variant.

I was hopeful about this game, but I don't think it entirely works.

The main problem seems to be that there is too much effort teaching/learning the game and getting familiar with the cards for what the game really gives back.  The game is best when it's played quickly, but it always seems to take a lot longer than it should.

Of course, playing it over and over with the same group could get help get to that point, but it's really not an interesting enough game to want to play that frequently.

This game is really fun if you play with the right people. I love the teamwork and hidden roles, though it's usually in everyone's best interest to just play their role rather than bluff. Works well with 5-7 players.

The game can drag out really long if everyone plays passive or gets unlucky with cards draws. Player elimination is a huge problem when the game drags out. It's also incredibly hard to teach because there are so many symbols and so many things going on.

RATING: 5
i love the idea, but the implementation seems kinda broken.  this can be forgivable in many cases.  here we've got elimination, variable game length, imbalanced roles, widely different game balance based on the number of players, etc.  all wrapped up in a casual game package which isn't actually easy to grasp for non-gamers because of card art.  the 3rd edition and/or deluxe editions seek to improve that though, so i'm curious again.

A quick card game simulating a gun fight in the wild west.  The game can be fun with the right group of players.

As the game drags on, the play experience goes down.  Keep it fast, furious, and fun. [GTI Code: TGCL]

A clever, fun card combat game which just smacks of its theme.

How you play depends on the role you've been given and what you can determine of the others at the table. So if you're playing with new players it can be difficult to determine who you should be shooting at.
It does seem well balanced with the increasing player count bringing in new roles.

Eh. It can bring out some fun moments (i.e. being the sheriff are randomly shooting people) but I don't think all that great. The problem is that until people start dying and their roles are revealed and you can take some concrete action, you just groping in the dark. An by time you can figure out what to do, it's either a piece of cake or a total loss. It reminds me of the haunt reveals in Betrayal on the House on the Hill.

But as said, you aren't really playing those games for their strategy, but for the experience, and for that I think could play this some more.

Based on a single game with 7 players, it was fun while I was in the game but I didn't enjoy being 1st out and waiting 45 minutes for the game to end.

After a couple more games (still with 7), I'm bumping my rating to 6.5. Definitely fun while in the game, but you can still wait around quite a while if you're eliminated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun with 5 or more players. With 4, the deduction part is trivial (the only one who doesn't shoot the Sheriff is the Renegade). Still, a fun game, and quite short, so it works wonders either as a filler or as a game to play with 6+ players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.9
Probably a very very unfair grade. Geez, I never ever played anything with a less concentrated crowd than this group. Talking to everyone not involved in the game, even SMSing during their own turn! Not listening to the rules and then asking the same questions about the cards over and over again. And those people are supposed to be gamers? Colour me astonished.

RATING: 4
Half the people in my group hate Bang, the other half loves it.  The truth is that it's decent fun and works pretty well for large groups.  In smaller groups it plays pretty quickly.  

Its biggest problem comes from the fact that it does have player elimination, and it's totally possible to be killed of and out of the game before your turn even comes around.

If you survive long enough squeeze off a few rounds, and throw down a high-noon duel or two you'll probably enjoy yourself.  On top of that, liberal use of the term "bang" is guaranteed to bring out the giggles in all but the stuffiest and overly mature groups.

update:
the last few times I've played this it has drawn out way too long.  While it's true that my group does tend to play things slowly, I think I'd have to be convinced to play this one again anytime soon.

This game starts well. The mechanics of the cards with the bullets representing life points is cool, but the endgame always deteriorates into a half hour two player shootout. 
While everyone else is having coffee, discussing politics, playing Guitar Hero, the two last players are trying to die as fast as possible to end the game. I want to like it more.

A twist on Werewolf that works quite well as a gateway game. Easy to teach, quick play with some interesting decisions. The elimination aspect is the one knock against this game, especially when games come down to the sherrif and renegade. Downgrading from 8 all the way to 6 with time (games too long, too short, doesn't work with everyone).

Good game overall for me as a fan of hidden role games. Feels a bit more strategical than the dice game but takes more to play, which slightly takes its toll on the nerves of the first player eliminated (nothing THAT obnoxious with a few players game, major problem with more). For me, having BANG the dice game and Samurai Sword makes this game not interesting to purchase.

A little on the random side, but a lot of fun with a group.  had a blast with seven people.  We also played with four, which was fun but not as interesting as only the two outlaws do not know who each other are, reducing the suspense.  The variety was greatly helped by the optional role cards after the first play.  Easy to tech for a not too serious evening of gaming with the family.

very light.  has been fun in many cases, particularly when the players do their best to obscure their roles.  in other cases, a card game with few choices (because you either know who your friends and opponents are or you only know who the sheriff is).  I pity the sheriff who gets to sit there, bored.  I also pity the Renegade who has such a low chance of winning.  In fact, I pity the Deputies too, who don't want to shoot each other or the renegade.  The Outlaws are the hinge of the game.  Once they start shooting AT THE SHERIFF, the game can be fun.  Unless it locks down again (due to lack of bullets, no guns, etc) which often happens.  Additionally, I feel the characters are significantly unbalanced.  Finally, just too long for the small amount of fun.  I'm not a big fan of games based on psychology (e.g., Diplomacy), but this one seems especially poor unless you're playing with some very extroverted people.  I used to like the game a lot, but each play I find myself enjoying it less.

Like so many multi-player card games, this one took a while for some of our group (ie, the wives) to warm up to. However, once you get the basic language down, and can know what a special card does without having to refer back to the Horribly designed rule book, the game becomes quite enjoyable. I like that this game really has two levels: one is the basic do damage to your opponents to win, but another level is much like Werewolf, where you can never really be sure who is friend or foe (or both). This second dynamic becomes much more pronounced and important proportionate to the number of times each player has played this game. Bluffing, "accidental" misplays, and other actions make this second aspect of Bang better, and therefore makes the game rate higher than the typical group card game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I tried this a few times with non gamers, but didn't have good success. Rule is not that complicated, but it took me a quite long time to explain all the details and cards, so non-gamers became tired even before starting the game.
Also game play is too chaotic to my taste. I also don't like the player elimination much.

RATING: 6.5
I have now played a handful of games with 5, 6 and 7 players.  One of the reasons I was attracted to German Games was the fact that player elimination was not a requirement of games.  That is the main goal of this one and I still thoroughly enjoy it.  

Of our games, I enjoyed playing with six most, but they have been due to using the seven players to teach FOUR new players!   I have found one thing difficult regarding this game and it's people who are unfamiliar with the cards knowing what to do in certain situations and that creates a lot of time having people reread the rules to get things straight.  It's put me off the game with each extra play. 

Each game is different as your own personal goals and abilities change with different roles and personalities.  A very good game when played with people who don't mind laughing at themselves!

RATING: 8
A light game with a favorite theme, the Wild West, that I always enjoy. It's great that you can play with 8  people, and the rules are fairly simple. Hidden agendas of each player means everyone has fun trying to figure out who is who. Thus this game has card playing skill factor, and a psychological element. 

I love games that pack a lot of strategy and fun in a small package. Bang! is of this type. Recommended as a party game and for card floppers, but of course can also be played in a competitive fashion.

I really like this card game.  Reminds me a bit of when I was heavily into Deadlands: Doomtown.  Unfortunately, we don't play the game much.  First, to maximize enjoyment, a full complement of players is best--I love the bluffing aspect.  I also feel that our group is so used to games where the players aren't eliminated, they grate at getting knocked out and having to sit idly by watching the rest of us interact.  Usually the time is minimal, but like I said, they've been spoiled with so many non-elimination games.  I'll have to lobby hard to get more games of Bang! in.  [Market price]

Good humor and originality. Very good gameplay with lots of people and very very easy to learn. A game of deception and intriguing more then anything where the goal is to kill the sheriff.. or in the case of you happening to be him kill everyone else.
Comes with a number of fun characters with different traits which are randomly selected each game. Each are good in their own way and keep it interesting even after many games played. A great tip for this game is to get the expansions dodge city and high noon.

Bang! can be an accessible, fun game well-suited for social gatherings and non-gamers.  On the other hand, it can be a bit hard to understand the rules, and for its hidden roles, it isn't all that mysterious (Saboteur does a much better job at that).  Overall, it's still good fun, and is best in social situations where you can play the game and do other things at the same time, and when played fairly quickly.

After many plays, I prefer to play with the base game (minus 1-3 beers), the Dodge City characters and non-green cards, and a house rule that each player can only have two blue cards at any given time (excluding Jail and Dynamite). I will also usually throw in (most of) A Fistful of Cards if everyone is willing, but don't mind playing without it. The result is shorter games with less defense, which I greatly prefer to the long standoffs that can occur without these tweaks. 

Rating based on playing at a fairly quick pace. If playing slowly: -> 4. (2008-10)

After a number of additional plays, many with new players but some with people who already know how to play, I have to downgrade Bang!'s rating. There is virtually no element of mystery except for the Renegade/Vice distinction, and thus very few meaningful decisions to make in the game. Even with experienced players, I quickly become bored unless we are playing at breakneck speed. The game is simply too much time waiting for my next turn, or playing more or less automatically out-of-turn. While I still enjoy the characters and some of the mechanisms on a conceptual level, the game as a whole simply doesn't hold up, and is always more fun in my mind than it actually is. Not a good sign. 7 -> 4. (2014-10)

Learned how to play it tonight after talking about it to customers for the last two Christmas seasons. Not too bad of a game, but we ran into a problem when it seemed like all the Bang cards had been used and only two players were left.

p: Avoid playing it with people who cannot hack elimination games, especially if they draw the short straw. If people don't mind the possibility of an early exit than they might discover an atmospheric, pleasant, albeit lengthy filler.

Combining a who-dunnit element with an all-out shoot-fest makes for intriguing play and the introduction of range, objects and variable abilities into a strong theme certainly brings it alive and increases its replay value. But when you are dealing with a game from which players can be eliminated even before they had a single turn, that more than suggests it's not the type of game to get too analytical about. And who not to play it with. 
  
On the whole I don't enjoy it when players have to step out early, and those games are rated as such. So apart from playing it in situations when drop-outs can quickly move on to something else (conventions anyone?), I cannot see myself suggesting it often. Nevertheless, with the right people and in the right mood it certainly can be enjoyable, especially if you manage to survive the initial kills. I would like to like it better than I do, I guess, which says something for its fun-potential too.

For a quick no barrels hold all-out shoot-fest it is bang on. For serious gamers who crave for control over other player's actions through sound strategy, first play will also have been its last chance saloon.

UPDATE: Yes, it's fun, but there's only so many times you can shoot someone and still find it enjoyable. Downgraded from an 8 to a 7.

Light filler fun.  Played a half-a-dozen time, all with 5 players.  Looks like it could be great mayhem and chaos with 7.  Elimination in this game brings it down somewhat, but I still like it.

Great filler game to round out gaming nights. Somewhat difficult to learn initially, but gets easier after a game. Games run fairly fast; only bummer is that someone could get killed early on and end up sitting around until the next game (which could be 1 - 45 minutes away).

I like this game a lot. It's a good hybrid of a card game and a social deduction game. Some of the cards are admittedly pretty "broken", but this can be adjusted by simply removing them from the game. Lots of fun with 7 players.

I'll admit that BANG! was the game that got me into the board game hobby. The social interaction and deduction was ever present, and it was fun to "bang" out combinations with your cards.

However, after having played over 20 times with a varied number of players, the flaws of the game have grown on me to the point where I would like to sell or trade my copy of the game.

My biggest complaint is that the game is too long to be a filler and not meaty enough to be worthy of the average 1h+ playing time. The game draws on too long with players recuperating health at the same rate as they are taking damage.

Otherwise, I guess BANG! is a good gateway game if you would like to try your hand at something deeper and more rewarding than traditional board games; however, it might not stay in your collection for very long as you branch out into better games.

RATING: 5.5
My favorite games usually have either secrets or treasure, or, if I'm lucky, secret treasure. The enjoyment I draw from this game is the excitement of not knowing what characters my friends are playing.  I've played it 4 or 5 times, and I like it for a quick group game.  It's not my favorite card game or my favorite party game, but I'd like to try out an expansion.

A wild west shot-'em-up card game. Slightly complex but after a turn or 2 you get the hang of it. After that point is becomes a good (if slightly long) filler or opener. Has the ability to drag out however, and such games are simply tedious.

Fun little filler card game with two drawbacks - one minor, one major.  Minor: special powers of cards are not written on the cards themselves so you must consult the rulebook (the same problem as with Family Business, only not quite so bad).  Major: player elimination.

Very fun medium light deduction game. Packs a lot of fun in a short time period. Needs some of the expansions to add to the replay value. Needs a minimum of 6 players to be at its best.

Fun to play at the Albatross pub in Berkeley with a group of 5 or more. Beer (or bev of your choice) is practically essential. Only bad thing is player elimination. Perhaps "ghost" variant can hasten things a bit and allow "dead" players to participate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
I'm just not liking this one.  It just seems to fall apart if some people aren't into the game (For Sale is a ten because it drags those people along, maintaining the structure for those who are interested, Bang doesn't do this).  Potentially a good game for experienced, but casual gamers.  I can't rate it higher because most gamers I play with won't come within ten feet of this one and the newbie unfriendliness (read: fragility and player elimination) of the system just put the final nail in the coffin for Bang.

A card game that accurately captures the theme of a western.  Unfortunately, it's not a theme I'm thrilled with.  Also explaining all the rules often turns off players who might enjoy the theme.  The iconography is not very well implemented, and most of the people I play with just don't understand.  The other problem is that players are expected to have secret roles, but it doesn't take more than a round or two to know who everyone is, and keeping the sherriff alive is next to impossible.

I love this game as light filler. It's a party atmosphere in a werewolf casing, but card driven, so you can "know" what to do. A little bit of psychology, a little bit of luck, and a lot of jokes about shooting the sheriff. Best with 5 players, I feel. And the expansions are good.

The absolute best type of filler; plays quickly, fun mechanics, and filled to the brim with flavour.  Play it with the soundtrack to "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" playing in the background for the ultimate Old West experience.  This just brings the fun, and afterwards, you'll be talking about all those cool gaming stories for days, like the time that "Bart" and "Lucky Dan" killed the sheriff before she got a second turn, or that time the sheriff blew himself up with the dynamite on turn two, or maybe the story where he refused to believe in his deputy, right up to the very, very end, or ... well, you get the point.  Meant as filler, but sometimes it hits the table and nobody wants to stop playing.  Grab a deck and invent your own "legends" of the west.  (as a side note, people who complain about balance issues in this game really don't have a clue what it's all about)

I played an 8 player game (using the Dodge City expansion).  It took longer to explain the rules than it did for the first 2 players to be eliminated.  (I was one of the eliminated, so take that as you want.)

Futher games revealed little more than a draw and play card game.  The cards don't seem very balanced and it's very easy to get blown away with no chance of retaliation or recovery in one sweep around the table.

While excellent for its time and one of my most played games of all time, I never find myself choosing it over the dice game. Every gamer should play this classic at least once, but the game honestly has a play time of 5 to 60 min depending on what happens. Also tends to be very luck driven. Still enjoy this when it comes out with a big group, but it has been replaced by a more streamlined successor.

A good game, but it doesn't catch everybody's interest.  The theme isn't quite right for everybody, and some people find the language-independent icons to be confusing.

When you play Bang! you can’t have enough of it: its light-hearted, quick-paced, full-fun theme screams for «just another run».

The expansions - though introducing new items, characters and cards - add very little to the basic game, which plays very good by itself: the only one I could recommend is «Dodge City», for it raises the number of players to eight.

I’m also curious about the forthcoming «Gold Rush» expansion, only because of the Bud Spencer and Therence Hill-inspired characters, a mandatory tribute to the genre. (September 2011)

Edit: After massively playing it over the last months, Bang! scaled down to a decent filler lasting too long: nonetheless, it can be moderately fun when newcomers and non-gamers are around, since it’s probably a game like none they played before, yet it still lacks any real appeal to the more seasoned gamers, who instead are prone to shoot the first one who dares say «just another run».

As a consequence, rating lowered from 7.5 to 6.

If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy said something like "Hey, look. He's carrying a soldering iron!" and started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say, "That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice." Then everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free drink.

It's a bit too long for what it is (for me).  Was just "eh" with my group.

Update:  It is fun as a 7 player game with the smack talk and such.  Gave me a yearning to play Gunslinger with 7.  No raise in rating but feel better about the game.  Update 2/10:  I raised it to a 7.  It's a good game with 6/7 people, and there are not many good 7 player games.

Volt szerencsém akkor játszani ezt a játékot, mikor még csak külföldről lehetett beszerezni. Megtanultuk az összes kártyát, betéve tudtuk. Hatalmas, emlékezetes partikat játszottunk, de mára a számtalan társasjáték háttérbe szorította. Szerintem nem gond a kiesés, mert a kiesők is végig figyelték a játékot. Azért egy idő után mikor végtelenségbe futott a játék, időlimittel abbahagytuk és jöhetett az új parti. Az egyik alkalommal egy barátomnál az ötéves kislány (3 nagyobb testvére van) rángatta a szülőket, hogy játszanak egy Bang-et. Na gondoltam ez is valami vicc lesz, hogy csak a kártyák dobálgatása miatt szórakozik a játékkal. Legnagyobb megdöbbenésemre, együl játszotta végig a partit, és  minden kártyát tudta mire való. Úgy csente el a többiektől pánik lappal a megfelelő kártyát, hogy csak lestem. Na itt kész voltam és újra kell gondolnom egy ilyen játék hány éves kortól játszható. Lehet, hogy legközelebb egy Terra Mystica-t fogok vinni a hónam alatt és megtanitom neki :D

Good game for 5-7 players. A few years ago I would have rated this even higher, but I've played it so much that I'm a bit burnt out by now. Easiest way to teach the game is to first introduce the roles and their different objectives, and then teach players how to read the symbols on the cards. 
If your group is looking for a Werewolf with more meat on it, Bang! is a good idea.

It was a bit slow, as it was a learning game for half of the table. Still, it was fun for what it was. The fact that you don't know who everyone is, is kind of weird when it comes to who to attack, because I was an Outlaw and I was eliminated by an Outlaw, because she didn't know who I was.

I definitely like Resistance better, but I would play Bang again.

A good choice for a larger group of players. We've played with up to 8 I think and is a lot of fun. Problem is that it can take some time with this number, for you to play your next turn!

Can be a fun romp, but overall I find it too chaotic & random. The game is luck heavy, and I don't like the bluffing aspect (i.e. pretending to be the innocent deputy today so you can build enough firepower to go gunning for the sheriff tomorrow).  I feel like you need to play this game with 7 players so there are 2 deputies and more uncertainties for everyone.  When it comes to bluffing about hidden alliance cards, I prefer the Shadows over Camelot game which gives players more control over their actions... and certainly, actions speak loader than words in Bang! and Shadows.

Also, the quality of the game is dependent on how lucky your sherriff is. If the sherrif has a bad day,  the game is a bit of a let-down. Not played much since I started logging plays.

Fun & cheap card game. It's great for groups of 4 and larger. This is also exactly what the problem is, you need at least 4 people to play. Also, it seems to be 95% luck based. But never the less, the sillyness of some card make it fun. I love the dynamite! :)

RATING: 5
2 plays:

Everyone likes playing, and the core mystery about identities is fun, but it can feel pretty weak on strategy and decision making. The shooting range and dynamite game mechanics feel tacked on.

Players who die early have nothing to do for the rest of the game.

The whole game just doesn't really come together. Still, a fun game to break out with a group.

Home rules:
為了增加警長的生存力，以及彌補最後才能行動玩家的不利，提供這些玩家一些選擇強力角色的機會。
假設遊玩人數為N，先在角色堆中隨機抽出N+1張角色，然後再隨機抽出３張，由警長先進行選擇，補充一張後以逆時計方向（即最後行動的玩家）傳給下一位玩家，如此類推直到所有玩家選擇角色完畢。所以第一個行動的玩家只能在最後２張職業中選擇其中一張。同時也避免了警長旁邊出現２隻過強角色的問題。

Great game. I haven't used any of the expansions yet, but the base game has been a hit with my group. Best with 7, but good enough with 5.

Update 6/14/09: Played with the Dodge City expansion. We actually had 8 players so the timing was good. I like the extra characters. I also like having more cards. The jury is still out on the green bordered cards. The main advantage seems to be getting in another shot without using a Bang! card. I'm not sure if it's worth the extra confusion of having cards with similar purposes that have a different name. We'll see.

This is the only game I've ever intrdouced to my wife and friends and was asked to play a second time immediately after the first.  It can be a problem if people are eliminated immediately but if it's a big party and there are other things to do, it seems to have worked out ok.  Also, so far every game I've played of this (and I've played from 4 to 9 players) has take under 75 minutes. however, i think that is about the limit for this to be a fun game.

This one had me a little puzzled when I played it. You're all given a secret role, which reminded me of Citadels a bit. Except the sheriff who is publically known to be the sheriff. But his two deputies, 3 outloaws and one renegade are all secret identies. Now there's a very clever ranging mechanism, in that your seating arrangement is relevant, youc an only shoot so far to your left or right depending upon the range of your weapon. That much is sweet. But combine that with the fact that as a deptuy you're on the sheriffs side and as an outlaw you're not, and no-one likes being accidentally shot by their mates, it only takes one or two practice games before everyone sees the vested interest in announcing unambiguously who's side their on. I mean why shoot randomly at people and get shot at randomly? Even before you work that out, the first person to shoot the sherif is either an outlaw or a stupid depty who wants to draw fire from the sheriff and the other deputy, and so it all falls into place in a matter of minytes who is who. Except for the renegade who'd like to remain secret, but what chance has he given that everyone else has a vested interest in publicising their identity. Worse yet, as a deputy the game seems completly mindless as you're job is to protect the sheriff but there is nothing at all you can do to achieve this except not shoot him. A totally frustrating impotence as deputy when you'd like to be able to lend the sheriff a hand somehow if times are tough beyond just taking pot shots at outlaws. And the poor as the poor old renegade no-one is on your side, everyone knows who you are right away as mentioned above and the only thing going for you is that the outloaws and good guys are actually more interested in wiping one anothe rout than you, so all you can do is take pot shots at the winning side now and then to keep the balance and try and win yourslef (which you can only do if you're the last one alive!). In short, as renegade the game also sucks somewhat in that you have nothing really interesting to do exzcept act as balance keeper for the other two sides and hope for the best (as six guns turn on you if you get to bothersome).

So while the game certinnly captures ome neat mechanics, ideas and thematics, somehow it falls flat for me in delivering fun and entertainment just taking pot shots at people and not really having a whole olot of planning, strategy or tactics to challenge you with. 

I'd call it a light hearted filler game to play between games or at the start or end of a games night. And yet for that it seems it can drag on a bit long sometimes alas ...

Rating of 4 is based on a handful of plays.  I seem to recall having to look stuff up in the rulebook a lot.  It's easy for me to get confused by the symbols on the cards.  The player elimination aspect is not one that I enjoy.  Much too long for what it is.

Bang is great fun with 5 or more people and is fairly easy to teach to new players. I'm not a big fan of how little the english text is on the cards (and would gladly buy an english only version). The game is full of inuendo and everyone I've played with has had a great time!

Urgh.  My first and hopefully only game of Bang consisted of me getting tossed in jail on the first two turns, having no Bang! cards in my hand with which to ward off Indian attacks, dying a gruesome death without having been able to play a single card, and getting to wait a good half hour until the game finished.  NO THANKS!

We've only played Bang with 4 people, and it definitely seems like it would be better with more players.  We also have the Dodge City expansion, but haven't played yet.  In general, the game (and the theme) is fun.  However, it takes a while to explain and several plays to really "get" the strategies.  Also, it sucks being eliminated early and having to watch everyone else play.  

Edit - we got rid of this game in a White Elephant exchange because (1) it's more fun with a big group which we never seem to have and (2) it's no fun if you get killed early. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Some players get a little edgy when whacked off in this game (including myself)! It's quite a melee, so the chaos factor is quite high. Its no fun getting killed in the first round before your turn even comes around, but it can happen. Most games are fun, but unpredictable, with almost every game someone getting blown up by the dynamite. Works just as well without the expansions, which simply provide a bit more variety than the base.

We had a ton of fun with this game when we were a group of 5 casual players on a train. In our larger group of regulars however it didn't work out so well.

There's a sweet spot of 5 or 6 players for this game. With less the roles aren't as interesting and with more it takes too long and it's too random - with large number of players it's not unlikely to be eliminated before you even get a turn or two.

Oh my, do I dislike this game.  Why is it everyone carries this stupid card game around and then pulls it out in large groups?

It's so boring.  It's even more boring when everyone instantly kills you because you bitch about the game and you end up having to watch other people play the stupid game and watch it drag on.  

 I think that common perception that non-gamers should play this game is false.  I think new players should be introduced to the best games, not the most mediocre!  Remember, "non-gamers" aren't necessarily idiots requiring simplicity -- they're just inexperienced.

RATING: 5
In this game, three sides battle for victory: the sheriff and deputies, the oultaws, and the renegade.  Only the sheriff's identity is known, and all the other roles are hidden.  The sheriff and deputies have to kill off all the outlaws and the renegade to win, while the outlaws only have to kill the sheriff, and the renegade wins if he is the last man standing.  This game is best if you play with seven players (the maximum). 

However, this game becomes very repetitive once you discover that if you are an outlaw, your best strategy is to always shoot the sheriff when possible.  Then everyone's roles become quickly discernible and the game quickly degenerates into who can defend or kill the sheriff.

No other role has any hope of winning, least of all the hopeless Renegade who is doomed to lose and have virtually no impact on the game. If the appalling play-balance problems weren't enough, the game is additionally almost completely uninteresting, with nothing in the way of choices that aren't utterly obvious. Avoid like the plague. I've heard this compared to Werewolf, which I think is a completely inappropriate comparison (as much as I didn't care for Werewolf, this is much, much worse). I have to admit I am utterly amazed by this game's high average rating; usually (like in Carcassone or Citadelles) I can just chuckle and ascribe it to taste, but this game is so utterly awful, I simply have no conception of where these ratings came from. Maybe a candidate for that list ...

Game is best when it moves quickly. Teaching it can be a bit of a drag, especially to non-gamers. If you have a group who all know what they are doing, the meta-game gets very interesting.

Bang! has captured that one elusive quality that all board games strive to achieve-- "playability."  While that may not even be a real word, gamers know what it means.  No one ever has any objections to pulling Bang! out of the box.  There may not be many opportunities to derive a strategic decision from this chaos-turned-card-game, but it's too fun not to try.  For example, the Renegade is seldom victorious, but I want to play him the most just for the challenge.  At such a low price, this game deserves its popularity.

RATING: 8
After a few initial plays, I like the game, but it's not a favorite so far.  I love waiting to see which role and character I'll draw and after that, it becomes an experiment to see who can draw the best combinations of cards.  Oh, you're the outlaw sitting next to the sherrif and have happened to draw a volcanic and seven bang cards?  That was fun.  Let's redeal...

On the plus side, it's easy to get people to play it because it's a light little affair without too much thought or a big learning curve. 

UPDATE: It's been years now that I've owned this game and we still bust it out and have a great time with it.  There's too much atmosphere to not love the game and it fills a special role within my collection.  It's not perfect, but it's dang fun if you don't play it too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Overall, I'm just not a huge fan of games with a bunch of "take that!" card play, and that's most of what Bang is about.  At the beginning, you're dealt a secret role, which dictates which players at the table you'll be aiming for.  Then, you all start killing each other via card play!

While the game is still ok for me, I'm not a big fan of this one without the High Noon expansion which adds a lot of fun and flavor, adding a special event to each round that influences play in different and unexpected ways.  Playing with only the base game leaves me pretty flat, though.

I had fun playing, but I'm not sure the game had any non-trivial decisions. I went first, and by the time it was my 2nd turn, everyone's identity had been revealed. From there, it was just a matter of hoping to draw the right cards. I haven't thought about it enough yet, but it seems only marginally more advanced as a game than Candyland (although it seems to make more with less than other, more developed games).

One of the two games that got us back into gaming as adults (the other is the highly clichéd Carcassonne).  Own two copies of the Bullet version and each of the expansions, and this is the first game we always bring out when we assemble 6 or more players.  Player elimination/down time aspect never bothered us, so we rarely turn to the Dice Game nor have we sought out the Samurai Sword reimplementation.

I want to love this game, but as my game group are having a hard time getting to grips with I just can't.  I won't be getting rid of it, I will instead be trying to bring it to the table since I have printed a cheat sheet out on the cards and will do a couple of dummy games with me being every single player.

12/12/08 update. Still having a hard time with all the cards.  But if we play with this same group another couple of times I am hoping it will become a perennial favourite!  Upgraded from a 3 to a 5.  Might make it to a 7 one day.

This game, which at it's heart seems to be a hidden team game long outstays it's welcome considering it has player elimination with mechanics that focus on two things dealing damage to someone and avoiding damage slash healing damage.

Someone gets beat down. They get back up. And so it goes until someone is unlucky. and they get eliminated. Then they can sit back and watch the same pattern repeat itself for all of the other players.

Wow.

As for the hidden roles, they aren't all that hidden. The outlaws attack the sheriff, the deputies and the sheriff attack the outlaws, and the renegade pretends to be a deputy until all the deputies and outlaws are dead. It's clever, but it means the roles aren't actually hidden (except, arguably, the renegade's).

I should point out that the role natives play in the game, as people who show up and try to kill all the whiteys, is, if I'm feeling generous, culturally insensitive, and if I'm not, simply racist.

The dice game version is far superior to the original card game version.

When I was new to games, I LOVED Bang! Now I'm pretty over it.

Bang! does one thing exceedingly well that no other game does: the theme is actually immersive. There's a fun roleplay aspect where you really feel like you're in the wild west gunning each other down. This is due to a few things: (1) the fact that the sheriff is revealed (2) the distance seating system (3) the lack of board. Everything is just your equipment and actions and (4) the variable powers (5) the PLAYER ELIMINATION. An unpopular thing to say, but I think that it's one of the things that makes the game work.

While it adds to the theme, the player elimination is a real problem as people can be eliminated before they even get a turn. This issue is exacerbated by the game's length, which is a problem all its own. At this point in my gaming life, if I'm going to play something this silly and chaotic I want it done in WELL under an hour, ESPECIALLY if there's elimination!

Quick note on the variable player powers. This is a mechanic I love and I am convinced that to date, no game has done them as well as  Bang! They all change the way that each game goes down for EVERYONE while staying reasonably balanced (now that they fixed the blue guy...) And they're all interesting. I think this even beats out Cosmic Encounter, where it seems every game someone has a power that's just lame.

The scaling is basically nonexistent as well. Play with four? More like snore! Play with 7+? Sure, if you want the game to run 2 hours. Ugh.

The hidden roles are also almost meaningless. Generally it takes a bit to figure out which is the renegade vs. the deputy but that's completely irrelevant unless you're Sheriff. But honestly, that's not that big of an issue.

In my experience, casual/nongamers are always fascinated by the concept and want to try it. It definitely gets points for that! Just beware though that there's a lot of small, fiddly rules to remember that can make it a hassle to teach new players.

All in all I'd recommend to someone new to the hobby but it's not something I suggest anymore.

Nice substitution for party game. Has a problem of possible early player elimination.After time, we realize that this game just has some issues that make it hard to bring to the table, unless everyone is prepared. For one the characters just aren't balanced those with only 3 life just to easy to get eliminated quickly. If Outlaws really want to they can just open up on the sheriff, especially if they are to either side of him/her. Group has to be willing to play the way game was meant to, which is everyone try to convince sheriff that they are the deputies.

I was able to buy a cheap copy, but with The Resistance, Cash n Guns, Saboteur, Shadow Hunters and many other games like Bang on my shelves, I just didn't see an opportunity to get it played. I would like to play it one day, but it seems like it's too long compared to many other "hidden role" games.

Now I finally got to play it. I played this right after playing Bang: The Dice Game, and I must say that the latter is a big improvement! Regular Bang felt way too long and too boring. B:TDG is a good game because it is so short; Bang is not… The alliances and secret teams don’t really work in Bang as it’s clear who is who, and then it’s all about getting the good cards and hurt your enemies (as you should, of course, but the game fell flat after B:TDG). Also, the renegade must be one of the most imbalanced cards in any game – even if the other players played crappy, it should be impossible to win with that character (yes, I know that many of you will probably claim that you’ve won playing the renegade, but man is he severely underpowered and I feel like I have already lost the game when drawing him – which just makes the game feel even longer)!

Quite random and suffers from player elimination. Deducing players' secret roles is the fun part though having now  discovered "The Resistance", I can't imagine playing this one any more. And is it just me or are some symbols less intuitive than they could be?

RATING: 6
FUN! I don't know what else to say. It's just grand, stinking fun. I know everyone says the 4-player version isn't as much fun, but I've played dozens and dozens with 4 and it's fine with my group. Even when we know what everybody is we still totally get into it and just enjoy the ride. 

Update 01/09
Sometimes the game is just too damn long and enjoyment is directly tied to who is playing. I was excited to try the game and play with larger crowds, but it didn't deliver for me the way it did when it was just four of us goofying around and learning about the world of Designer Games. Lowered score to a 5 and I am wishing my friends I original learned this with were around.

Still fun, but mostly for the hilarious inneudo the game generates: "First, I'm going to BANG you, then, because of my special ability, I'm going to BANG you. Then, I'm going to duel you and we'll see who can BANG the longest."

Update 01/10
Turns out that reintroducing it to new players has given this game a new life and energy. It didn't hurt that we played with music from spaghetti westerns in the background. There's a great review of Bang about how the game is less than the sum of its excellent parts. From a gaming perspective, I agree. But when people are playing and having fun----it makes me want to play again!

Update 08/11
Shadow Hunters and Resistance have edged out BANG for our play group (drops a point down to 6). BANG still works for non-gamers and family however.

Good social game. Has a bit of a Werewolf/Mafia feeling to it, since the majority of roles are hidden. Can suffer if nobody is willing the start shooting people, but that means sometimes there are random shots. Lots of opportunity to screw your neighbor, but that means setting yourself up as a target. Card text and icons are a bit fiddly until everyone gets used to them, which makes this game a difficult introduction for new players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The fun in this game boils down to trying to figure out what player is what role, the dynamite card, and killing off other players.  I also enjoy the distance mechanic based on the number of players seated between you and your target player.  There is a conundrum here that the more players makes the game more balanced and tense, but the downtime increases and more players get eliminated and have to wait longer for the next game.  The game also gets bogged down in chrome, fiddly rules, and a loss of fun once the player roles are discovered.

Light game, with many cards whose functions are not readily understandable from looking at the cards themselves (must look up in rulebook).

What a boring and pointless 'game'. It is possible that watching 6 hours of Clint Eastwood westerns, all the while getting horribly drunk, and talking in a fake Mexican accent may make  this game bearable. But I doubt it.

I had read reviews of Shadow Hunters describing that game as "it's Bang, but better." So, I was curious to try the "inferior" version. 

I actually like this better than expected. But I agree--I think Shadow Hunters is better. The reason is that these games are supposed to thrive on the secret identities and the discovery of alliances. In Bang (at least our game!), the roles were pretty obvious to deduce, or an unknown role didn't matter. Gameplay focused on getting guns and good cards. In Shadow Hunters, there's more pressure as the game builds--the secret roles seem much more a central aspect of the game.

Still, this wasn't bad, and I'd be willing to try it again to see if my opinion changes.

Update: 2nd play, and my opinion changed--for the worse. It bugs me that a game where roles are supposed to be secret is ironically fairly easy to decipher. This is where Shadow Hunters is the superior game. Player elimination in Bang can also be a bummer, with the end game dragging on a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Bang! has provided fun "treachery in compact form" between many a larger game.  It's one of those games that I'd not want to play every week but would be willing to play less often as a filler.  The two problems I have with it are the predictability--with certain numbers of players, finding out who's whom is relatively easy, at least until you get to the last couple of players--and the player special abilities.  Some special abilities, especially the 3-health ones, seem a little underpowered, and if you're the Renegade or if your side gets hit with a couple of these, you might have no chance.  And why do I always end up as the sheriff??

RATING: 7.5
This game is awesome with 5+ players. Really enjoy it. 
Great "screw-you" game and its fun to try to guess who is who. Only the Sheriff is revealed.. Then there is a hidden Deputy, Outlaws and Renegades.. All firing bullets all over the place.. The Sheriff's job is to survive and take out the outlaws and Renegades.. The Deputy trying to help the Sheriff, but since the cards are hidden Sheriff has no idea at the beginning where the Deputy are.. The Outlaws and The Renegades are also hidden, they try to fool the Sheriff and think they are the Deputy etc etc.. so its a great fun mechanic and with some beers and the right mood its a blast.. Find it hard for the Renegade to survive though, Since they need to take out the outlaws and kill The Sheriff to Win the game.. Sweet game!

update 1: Have started to play Bang on my iphone instead, a great app and still fun, it even has multiplayer online.

Update 2: Just found out there was a Bang The Dice Game. Since i have problem to bring Bang to the table i think this Dice version can be better!?

This was one of the first games I really got into. However, if you don't have the right number of players, the gameplay significantly suffers, for example the sheriff has a MASSIVE advantage in a 4 player game to the extend that the minimum number of players should probably just be 5. The cowboy theme is awesome and fun, but it can be a little too easy to guess players' roles since the first time you shoot will probably scream to everyone exactly what your goals are, especially if someone decides to turn the game into a liar's match early on. Basically, the game suffers from an extremely awkward play stage at the beginning where everyone is pretending to be the same role.

Main Positives: Very attractive and there's a lot of variety with the character abilities.

Fun Factor: High to Medium
Complexity: Learning the cards can take a while.
Replayability: Yeah... Played with 6 & 7 players... Might want to play it with 4.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
It's a slow game. Not much flexibility with a few cards like the beer card which you cannot give to anyone and there are lesser bang cards. It would be better if players have a larger hand of cards and that more bang cards are included. I really like the conflict that goes with the game... it's just not enough especially to satisfy the theme. 

The dice game is much better.

I heard good things about this game just like I heard Talladega Nights was funny. NEVER listen to fools. This game is not god aweful but it is close. I like the theme and feel and was excited to play my first game. After two turns around I was dead and sat around waiting for about 45 minutes for the game to end. Elimination games suck. Well the second game I stayed in till the bitter 90 minute end. I was the sheriff and after about a half hour I couldn't care less what happened as long as it ended soon....no such luck. Elimination, down time and lack of card play options drag this game down.

Looks interesting, and I've heard good things from others.  I'd love to get this played, but rarely have enough players.  And when I do, there's usually something we'd rather play more.  Maybe someday...

[b]Update[/b]:  Picked up the iPad version on sale, and my son & I have been playing quite a bit.  Great way to learn the game -- and to play when you don't have enough live people.  Really fun, and we've played the physical copy as well now.  Yes, there's player elimination, but it's short enough that I don't mind.  Plus it's still fun to see how it plays out, even if your character is no longer around.

This game is fun... while you're still in it.  Unfortunately, it suffers from the ailment of all games where you can get knocked out early: sitting and watching others play.  Luckily, that doesn't last four hours like in Risk... and if people play a little fast and wild, I like it better.  In any case, though, I still have enjoyed every game I've played, though it does wear thin after a while.  

UPDATE:  I updated my rating from a 6 to a 7 given the ridiculous number of times this hits the table.  In moderation, it's still fun, and I'm hard pressed to find a game that can be played in such a short timeframe with so many participants.  

UPDATE:  I upped my rating more.  It's not a heavy game or a deep game, but for me, it approaches a classic.  Not for euro-snobs, but an essential addition for the well-rounded gamer.

One of the few large group, non party games I have so great for large groups. However the elimination becomes a bigger issue as the group gets bigger. My Younger cousins like it but it can become two slow and take to much time to keep their concentration friendly/ The most annoying part is i always have to remind new players to look at the card that explains, special symbols!

Bang isn't necessarily a "bad" game, but it's the type of game I almost never want to play.  You have a secret identity as a Lawman, or type of bad guy, and an agenda to kill one or more of the types of other players in the game. On top of that, you also have a randomly assigned personality that adds a certain beneficial trait. 

Seems like a great setup!  So your guns are pointed at all other players in a mexican standoff, you have to figure out who to kill and not kill, and you'll get various cards and gear to do that effectively. 

Unfortunately, there's really no way to know who you're shooting at until the end of the game when they're dead.  The sheriff is known by default, but it's very common that players will misinterpret each others actions and misidentify their target.  This makes the game much less about skill, and the winner is often the person who just happens to be the least targeted person at the table.  

To make matters worse, the game doesn't always necessarily end quickly, and when you're dead you're just plain out of the game.  This means you can start with a nice happy group of people, and a bunch of them end up sitting around doing nothing but watching while the last 2 or 3 duke it out.  I'm just not a fan of exclusionary tactics.

Bang can be enjoyable but it often over stays its welcome. It always feels like it drags on a bit too long. The icons on the cards require a lot of rulebook referencing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   for a game that feels like a social party game. Bang can be great fun with the right group of people.

Lots of fun.  Best played with either 5 or 7, but good anytime.

UPDATE: 1/30/08 (90 plays) - Plays well with any number over 5, especially once you get a competent renegade.  We will always be playing with the Dodge City expansion now (except with new players), since the new characters and cards add a lot to the game.

For games with 3 or 4 or players, we use the Posse variant, which is a lot of fun.  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/info/23136

Great high-interaction title. Can sometimes be confusing to keep track of other players' roles, and sometimes it feels overly difficult to strategize with a random hand of cards, but even then the comedy of the player interaction and the chaotic guesswork of trying to cooperate with only your teammates keeps things interesting and fun.

I'm not terribly fond of player elimination, but I don't normally consider it a mortal sin of game design.  Except in this game.  Player elimination after that player has had a chance to do something or after multiple negative actions is one thing, but random player elimination based on a single card draw at the very beginning of the game is out of line.

The situation: I'm one of the characters that starts with three lives.  Right-hand opponent plays a dynamite.  Dynamite comes to me, I draw the wrong card, and lose three lives.  Boom, I'm out of the game.

This just seems to be a game of extremes.  You either love it or hate it; feel engaged in the play or see too little interaction.  I think the game is fun and engaging and have almost as much fun when it is not my turn.

I also think the game is a good gateway but feel it has to be played at least twice in a row during its intro.  The first round seems to be a lot of rules and players trying to understand the effect of the myriad of cards.  But playing a second game usually sells everyone on how easy it really is.

Unimpressive card game, quite chaotic, and you're always at the mercy of the draw. Good draws? You'll probably win. Bad draws? You'll probably eat lead early and sit around waiting for the game to end. And by 'good draws' I mean *especially* early on, I pity the poor bastard who ends up as the renegade, particularly in a 7 man game.

The most damning thing about this game is its potential length. Losing early can mean sitting around for the better part of an hour if the game plays long, and that is way, way too long for a game of this sort...even for the players, let alone the dead people.

I've now played the game ten times (6 players) and my rating has gone up and could go up more.  The more recent games were a quicker as people became comfortable with the rules and the card content.  There is a lot of information on the cards.  I recommend the player aids here on the geek; they really helped.  It also hurts that players are eliminated and are sitting around watching (sometimes for a while).  Another negative is that it can take a while before you get to do anything as you wait for your turn to come around.

Worthless.  I had high hopes for this as a fun, multiplayer card game but it's so pointless and simple-minded that it just wasn't any fun at all.

Way overrated.

Jogo "fast paced" com ações e respostas instantâneas baseadas em cartas e compras imediatas. Pode ser bem divertido, dependendo do grupo.
O maior ponto negativo é que os jogadores não "morrem ao mesmo tempo", logo, se um é eliminado muito cedo por falta de "espírito de equipe", tem que esperar um bom tempo até o jogo finalmente terminar.

First hidden role game I played besides Mafia (even before Werewolf).

Really just love how fast-paced and fun the game is, not super keen on the way roles work. I love deduction games, but the hidden role element to this game is less about deduction and more about making careful allegiances. Still an awesome simple game to play with just about anyone.

Played once, and did not like it. It seems too light for serious gamers, but the two non-gamers that tried it with us were overwhelmed by the various card powers, and did not enjoy themselves. The pictograms on the cards didn't help - a sentence or two of text would be much more clear. Multiple plays may have improved this, but they had no wish to try again. I dislike elimination games anyway, so I'm not going to be looking for a repeat, and definitely won't be buying it.

This game can be slow with more players... especially as you are learning or if people don't like to shoot at people.  Also the rules are a pain in the but to use.  Maybe a good player aid would make a difference.

También juego sin las dos cartas de Diligencia ni la del Wells Fargo para acortar las partidas, de esta forma posiblemente sea el mejor juego colaborativo. Recomendados también los personajes del Dodge City.

Not impressed by first play.  Game probably shines once you know the cards, but otherwise I am not so sure.  Most of the time I couldn't get an upgrade in my gun so I just couldn't do much of anything.  Another one sent packing in a trade.

lots of fun things going on in this game, so it never gets boring, which is great.  it's slightly too complicated and has a bit too much randomness to be able to execute too much strategy, though.  also somehow i find the victory condition less exciting than average -- "yay i did what i was supposed to" somehow isn't as satisfying as seeing a little dude at the head of the pack or something.  maybe that's what it is -- that there's no visual representation of progress during the game.

RATING: 7
Great party game.  May take a couple play-throughs before new players grasp the mechanic and strategy of the game, so it requires some patience and to teach and learn, but once all players are into the swing of it, it can serve up some wild twists and turns and a lot of fun.

RATING: 6
Fairly simple cowboy western card game. Not my favorite western game (Carson City takes that spot) - I enjoy the bluffing aspects of the game and figuring out who's after the sheriff and who's not.  There are better bluffing/deduction games out there though.

UPDATE: Need to check out this dice game I'm hearing so much about.

RATING: 7
Get a Bang for your buck with this little role playing
card game with hidden identities. Love playing out the old western scenario with simple cards. Sometimes frustrating
when opponents seem to dodge bullets endlessly. Otherwise highly recommended as a short intense filler
after a hard night of pushing cubes around in a typical
euro game. Nice change of pace. Giddyup little buckaroo
see you by the watering hole for a brewski.

Good semi cooperative game.  I played the game in a circle of six players and had a good time learning the game - enough to buy it after one game.  It's the wild wild west.  Are you a good guy or a bad guy?  Everyone needs to figure everyone else out to position for the win.  Fun for all including non gamers.

So much fun for a large group. You want the maximum players allowed by the rules to play this fast fun exciting game. The only flaw of this game is player elimination. What do you do after you got shot out of the game? 
No desire to buy the physical game. I love Bang the Dice game more.

Essentially a werewolf/mafia variant, but the spaghetti western theme combined with the clever mechanics (range, playing card integration, variable player powers) turn this party game into a fun diversion welcome just about anytime (just not twice in a row).  Great gateway game, especially if the 'gatewayers' are familar with Mafia.

RATING: 5
Rarely hits the table, due to the unfortunate combination of "plays best with lots of players",  "player-elimination is an integral part of the game", and "isn't over quickly enough for the player elimination to not be a bother".

Aside from those problems, it's not too bad.

Bello ma poco longevo, dopo una decina di partite diventa difficile giustificare una partita riducendosi a un gioco da proporre unicamente alla componente neofita (o ignara) dei propri amici. Considerando il successo planetario (e forse anche in pò eccessivo) che il gioco ha avuto nel corso degli anni e le innumerevoli partite (di troppo) giocate da chi lo possiede, è certamente consigliato a chi prevede di giocarci con persone poco esperte... O, meglio ancora, bambini.

Resta comunque un gioco molto divertente, che nel bene e nel male ha contribuito a scrivere la storia del card-game made in italy in italia e nel mondo: se volete fare un reglo diverso a un amico non appassionato, con la "pallottola" andate sul sicuro!

Components: Quality cards. Nice, subtle artwork. I dislike that two cards could have the same function, but a different image (e.g. the two images for the Bang! cards). The iconography (hats, targets) is confusing. The distance rules are very difficult to keep track of. We had lots of rules questions, and were constantly referring back to the rule book.

Experience: It's Risk, it's Werewolf, it's vicious, it's epic. There is a major flaw, in that a game could potentially last forever (my second playing, with five people, lasted well over an hour). The mechanics are very simple once they are familiar. The character powers are great, adding a different personality to each player. The different objectives lead to some very interesting initial moves, before the streets erupt into open warfare. All the cards are useful at one point or another.

I love Bang!, and I own 2 well-used copies.  Each copy cost about $14.  I had thought I had lost my original copy, so I had bought another one.  Then I found my first copy.
Brent Clark introduced me to this game when it first came out.  He was looking for simple card games to play with his wife, but this one didn't quite fit that criteria.
I have bought 14 copies of Bang!, and resold several copies to friends or given them as Christmas gifts.  So lots of people around me know how to play Bang!
To make for a longer game, I have a house rule that you can't attack anyone until they have had their first turn.  That makes it a bit too long of a game, but it does give everyone a chance to put out some blue cards to protect themselves before being attacked.
I have printed off rules for 2-player and 3-player games, as well as FAQs.  I keep all of my characters from the various expansions together in one deck, so they are all available in every game I play.  I deal out 2 character cards to each player and let them choose which one they want to be.

Only played once but I'm worried... elimination aspect is more troubling than I thought. Plus the game can be malicious (i.e. gang up on the sherrif or whoever).

I don't get this one - I really wanted to like this when I first read about it - the idea of a Werewolf-like card game sounded great!  However it seems that the outlaws will always win by just coming out blasting (at least that's what I did the few times I played).  There are so many fans of this though, that I'd like to think that I'm not clever enough to see the strategy.  Someone help me see the light!

This game is a card-based shooting match set in the old west. The only problem is you don't know who you're shooting at? Also, people can be eliminated from the game early, and may need to wait a long time before joining into the next game

RATING: 9
This game has made game players out of many people who never played games before. It fits the spaghetti western theme perfectly, and it is great for letting out some aggression. You would be surprised to find out that your pastor or your mom can't wait to shoot their family when given the opportunity. The only down side it that the game is an elimination game, but at least eliminated players still win if their team wins.

Every time I've brought this out, the game has been a failure because of the need to memorise or look up the rules for all of the special cards, and because the symbols on the cards are not intuitive.

There are many other games that play so much better than Bang!  Shadow Hunters and Ca$h & Gun$ are two such games.  The games of Bang! that I've played have ended long after I stopped having fun playing.  That's the biggest downfall of the game, in my opinion.

Get Shadow Hunters or Ca$h & Gun$ instead.

RATING: 6
I haven't had a chance to play with more than five so I know I haven't really experienced the game at its full potential.

Still, I'm not as crazy about the game as I thought I would be.  It is fun but the game can drag on for quite awhile if the situation and cards are right.  If it weren't for the highly variable and potentially long play time the player elimination wouldn't bother me much but for its length there are other games I would generally choose to play.

It certainly does do the western theme justice though.  The characters are great and trying to figure out who is on your side is good fun.

Picked this up cheap. The art is bad. Game looks like fun though. Rating 6.
--------------------------------
UPDATE: Played this a bunch. Who cares about the art. This game is so fun it is crazy! This is a must have. 
Note the following: Try to play with 6-7 players. Has player elimination, a player can be eliminated without ever even participating in the gunfight. The eliminated player can be forced to wait a while, as the midgame can last, due to Beers and Saloons. 

Overall a must have must play game. Loads of fun. 
Rating 8.5
---------------------------------------
UPDATE: 3 months in. Ok, is there any way to get my play group to NOT ask for this game?? I'm like: I brought 10 games what do you wanna play? Bang! Honestly, can we try something new? No. This eats game night. I guess its bugging me because I always get killed first. 
Dodge city is a great addition here. 
Rated down to 8 because even though I'm getting bugged by it, it is still the only game where a player will laugh so hard he'll fall out of his chair, and the group will ask for it 100% of the time.

A "take-that" ameritrash game that pretends to be about "hidden roles", "bluffing" and "deduction"... which it is not...  though it will probably fool you on your first plays and you'll be very excited about it because it feels like it has sooooo much potential to be good...  which it is not!
It's actually quite terrible...

Good hidden role game with a fun wild west theme. Has the potential to way outlast its welcome depending on card draws and how fast other players are eliminated.

When the dynamite card is in play the game is at its most fun.

Fun game. Kinda like the card game "Mafia" with a few twists. Such as choosing who you wanna kill and distance.
Only thing is my buddies think its funny to text each other and find out who everybody is which makes the game alot less fun and almost pointless. So I suggest a "no-cell phone" policy when playing this one and it makes for a fun time.

Note: Can end up being a longer game and not fun for people who get eliminated early. It can be a real short game too.

I was hoping for a bit more from this game honestly.  I frequently struggle with finding games to accommodate 6+ players as when we play games around the holidays, it's a family affair.  For that reason, I bought BANG! with the hopes that this could become a favorite within our large-ish family group, but after playing a few games with my family, they seemed to find it a bit boring, and couldn't stay interested.

RATING: 5
At first, I really liked the idea of this game. It brought back memories of back when we would play "Mafia." However, after a few plays, the game got a bit boring/repetitive...kind of like after playing Mafia a bunch of times. I'd rather play Resistance which has similar concepts, but is more engaging.

RATING: 4
I really wanted to like this, but it goes on too long for what it is.  Game play is obvious and dictated by the cards you receive.  Anyone ever see the renegade win?  For as light of a game as it is, it is hard to introduce to new players because of the Byzantine symbology on the cards.  THe most complex cards have a book icon, referring one to the rules.

Good gateway game, though it can get annoying after several dozen plays. Without any way to investigate a player's loyalty, you can only guess it based on who they're shooting.

In Bang! keren we terug naar het Wilde Westen. De Sheriff jaagt op de Renegade en de Outlaws. De Outlaws zijn vogelvrij verklaarde misdadigers die er niet voor terugdeinzen om de Sheriff een kopje kleiner te maken. De Sheriff krijgt echter hulp van de Deputy’s. Deze hulpsheriffen zouden hun eigen leven riskeren om de Sheriff in leven te houden. Tenslotte is er nog de Renegade. De Renegade probeert zich aan te sluiten bij de groep van de Outlaws of bij de groep van de Sheriff en zijn hulpje, maar uiteindelijk heeft de Renegade maar één doel: ervoor zorgen dat iedereen sterft zodat hij als enige overlevende overblijft in de Far West. De grote egoïst!

El floppo.  In one game, half the table didn't get a turn.  In the other, the sherrif set up some degenerate combo where he could keep playing cards until he drew a dodge. We played for an hour, couldn't touch him and gave up.  Two radically different games, each at once boring and irritating in their own special ways.  Everyone hated it.  Embarrassing.  SOLD.  An unbelievably stupid game.

Love the spaghetti western theme but player elimination ensures that at least one person will always have a crappy time. Also the pure randomness can cause some games to stretch out for a long time: two or three people drawing unusable cards while everyone else watches for 20 minutes is just not good design. 

That said, if you aren't eliminated, and if the cards cooperate, it can be really fun. I will play if suggested once in a while knowing going in that it may be great or totally lame.

RATING: 6
Good little werewolf variant, though with some quirks.  Like the whole I'm closer to you or I'm further from everyone thing gets confusing.  And what is with the sheriff not knowing who his deputies are?  I think what really rescues this game for me is the variable player powers.

RATING: 3
It sounds like a good idea for a game - in theory.  Unfortunately, actual play seems to fall short of the ideal.  When our group tried it, there ended up being very little strategy - everyone just started blazing away, and it didn't seem to matter too much at all as to who got shot.  In short, it was mostly just going through the motions turn after turn.  
The game does excel in one category, though.  Without question, it wins the Grand Prize for the dirtiest sounding table talk of any game out there - including the infamous "wood for sheep".  
PRIME EXAMPLE I'm playing a Bang card - Who are you banging? - I'm banging Bob - Well, I'm going to bang you twice - etc, etc, etc..., in multiple variations.  You have to wonder if the designers of this game deliberately meant it to be like that, or was it a genuine accident?  Either way,  it'll take some doing to ever top this one.

Bang! can be a lot of fun and is a great social game with a larger crowd. But when players are new and/or afraid of shooting people to avoid revealing who they are, the game can drag and get really boring. This also allows the sheriff to grow overpowered and practically invincible in the game.

A game I found through searching reviews. Absolutely love it! It's a great party game, or just a good game for light play with gamers. The game gets better with most of the expansions. This game has a strong theme, especially if you add thematic pieces.

RATING: 5.25
The concept of this game is great: mix a little bit of werewolf with some strategic elements.  Even more than this, the game has great merit.  

But I have two big problems with the game.  The first, is that is takes a long time to play.  In fact, every time I've played it, it seems to overstay it's welcome.  This is a big problem as far as I'm concerned.  

My second problem is that there are too many rules to appeal to my non-gamer friends, and the game is a little light on interesting decisions to appeal to my gamer friends.  So this game hits a middle ground that does not really appeal to me or any of the people that I normally game with.  I know it's popular, but it must appeal to a different group than I usually hang out with. 

The bottom line: for what the game is, I want less rules (like Werewolf).

This game is good for a few laughs. Unfortunately the best strategic play is to stay out of battles.  Drink "beers" and collect "misses".  If everyone does this though, it becomes a snoozer.  It works with 7, so it hits the table every so often.

RATING: 7
Fun, shoot-em-up card game for 4-7 players.  Each player takes on a role (sheriff, deputy, renegade, outlaw) with a different goal in the game.  Game turns are very simple, draw two cards, play/discard down to your hand size, and generally blast away at anything you can reach.  The hidden nature of the roles/goals do create some bluff and tension, but generally this game is a rollicking ride.  Well worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun Mafia style action. I like the Old West theme and the challenge of the Renegade, but the fact that almost random shooting on the part of the Sherrif can lead to victory as well as one who tries to determine his target's identities before he shoots them down became frustrating. Still, this game calls to me sometimes.

Hmm, fun so far, but really need a lot of people to play.  I got the feeling that people can be picked on easily in this game, and can spend a lot of down time between games, which would suck.  Luck of the draw seemed to play a lot in this game.  I was known as the guy lucky enough to always draw a bang card when needed.

Idea:
Each player gets secret identity except the sheriff. Then try to play cards to kill other players depending on your role and try to guess who they are as each player has different goals.

RATING: 7
One of the few games that doesn't take too long and my non-gamer friends actually understood relatively quickly (the symbols were a bit confusing at first though).  But they seemed to get the concept faster than even Bohnanza.  Would be better if I could gather enough people more easily though.  The shorter duration also makes it more appealing as a game to take out and play for us busy college students.  Also how it's slightly similar to Mafia (known as Werewolf here at BGG), a game that most of us learned in the dorms.

Edit: After a few more playings, I've realized just how confusing those symbols are to new players... so rating dropped a little bit.

A playing of Bang! has always gone the same way for me.

Someone suggests it, I look forward to playing it, recalling that I rather enjoy it.

Then we play, the same off-color "jokes" that weren't really funny the first time get used.

The least popular person (or the one who won the last game) gets taken out.

I look forward to the game ending.

I wonder why I looked forward to playing it in the first place.

But then, the next time it is brought up, this whole story repeats itself.

Even those who have played multiple times have trouble with some of the cards. Actual words would have been much better than symbols. It's usually easy to determine which role each player has drawn. There are much better card games to play with seven people...Bohnanza comes to mind. Do not recommend.

One of the first successful hidden identity games for larger groups of (7) players.  I am probably giving this a much higher score than it really deserves as I can see how this was very fresh and an industry-changer when it first came out way back in 2002.  However by 2016 standards, the game is broken and completely supplanted by newer games (such as it’s own re-implemented “Samurai Sword” game in 2012).  I would assume a lot of players still play this more for nostalgia reasons than actual game-play.  If you are considering “Bang!”, I highly recommend trying its younger sibling “Samurai Sword” first: that game plays smoother, is more streamlined and does NOT have player-elimination.

Aun no decido que nota ponerle a este juego, la verdad es que si bien es divertido, simpatico y la gente la pasa bien, no me convence del todo, eliminacion de jugadores y tiempos muertos hacen que el juego pierda ritmo, pero por otro lado con un grupo agil se puede mejorar esto y reirse su buen rato con Bang!

The setting and basic flow of this game is quite okay. However, unlucky players may find themselves eliminated after their first turn (or even before that!). The player roles are quite unbalanced as well, since outlaws only need to kill the sheriff, while the renegade has to kill all other players, and even in a particular order to boot! Also, the game suffers from excessive language-independency: all card actions are explained by symbols which are cryptic and hard to understand.

I'm not a huge fan of this game.  A lot of the game is pure chance and the decision making isn't very complex.  It's also really boring once you die and have to sit out, probably the biggest weakness.  I'm not sure why it's so popular -- maybe because of the theme?

I played many 7 player games of Bang! during one weekend in 2005 with a group of friends. It was enough to know that it was a card game which I wanted in my game collection and is ideal to have for a large group of people. I am not too fond of card games in general, but BANG! is one exception.

Having different possibilities for which character you choose is interesting. Each character has its own power which can be a factor on how well a player can do during a game. Some character are better than others.

Different characters, different roles you can do. Lots of possibilities.

I would want to play the game again sometime soon, hopefully with 7. Possibly with family rather than my usual gaming friends. I would be curious to know their opinion of this game. Looking forward to my next game.

Got 2 copies.

I used to like BANG a lot more, but a couple issues have really made the game less desirable to play recently.  First, it's usually way too long for what it's supposed to be.  It should be a quick playing game, but everyone ends up playing a lot more slowly than it should be.  Also, every time it's brought out, it attracts 8 people, which makes quite a long game.  Furthermore, all the expansions seem a little unnecessary.  I would take the first expansion and that's it.  The game also unfortunately suffers from the teaching.  It's a simple game, but you almost always have to teach it again, and getting all 8 players to know the symbols can be an annoyance.  It still has a nostalgic place for me, but unfortunately I think other games have outshined it over the years.

I like the secret identity aspect AND the roles.  Some identities are more powerful than others, but not breakingly so.

Maybe I just don't have 5-7 friends around me all that much that would rather play this than poker.

A nice group game, but the main difficulty with this game is understanding all the symbols on the cards, it will take a practice round for players to play properly.

Bang probably win the award for "game I am most conflicted about."

On one hand, I love the theme. Come on! Spaghetti Westerns! Really!

On the other hand, my issues with the game are many:

1) The deduction element of the game is either absent or aggravating. Basically everyone just starts shooting at anyone they can shoot at because they can.

2) The cards. I know it was a choice to keep the cards "language neutral" but it's a pain in the neck to explain the cards time and again to people that haven't played the game regularly.

3) The card effects. Now I'm a role-player from way back, so calculating all sorts of bonehead modifiers is second nature to me, but just try to explain to someone that due to the cards in front on them, you can be three spaces away from them but they are only one space away from you.

In short, this is one of those games that has a way steeper learning curve than a "light" game should have. I keep looking at this game on my shelf and wondering if I should get rid of it, but I end up keeping it anyway.

If I get to see the newest edition and the cards are easier to explain, I may change this rating.

Overall, a fun game, which suffers from similar problems as Werewolf: early elimination. It is slightly less random, but that comes down to who the Sheriff is, since he can sometimes eliminate someone even before he has the chance to act. And there can be a lot of downtime between two turns.

On the other hand, there aren't that many games that aren't complicated nor long, and that lets 8-12 players play and have a blast. It gets old soon, depending on the playerbase.

Bang! is best with 5 or more players, so I rarely play anymore. There are a lot of minor rules that are not clearly spelled out and can cause debates mid-game, it is not the most friendly game to beginners. Also, games are fairly long for a card game which can make getting eliminated in the first round or two really frustrating. I have played several hundred games of Bang! and still really enjoy it. I would say it is a must-have if you like a variety of card games.

Bang suffers from the same problem as Munchkin: it doesn't hit its sweet spot until you have 5 or more players, but by then the playing time starts to increase drastically for each additional player. With 7 or 8 players, the game can go well over half an hour unless everyone is playing quickly (which is really how the game should be). 

However, if you have a willing, exuberant group, playing this game along with Cowpoker and The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin will give you a fun Western-themed evening.

A fun group card game for 4-7 players (best with 6 or 7), where you play roles as sheriff, deputies and outlaws, trying to shoot each other and figure out who is who.  Great bluffing and interaction.  Drawback: player elimination (but not a concern if players familiar with the game play quickly).  The two & three player variants from the designer also work well.  We sometimes play that nobody can play "take that" cards in the first round, to prevent a player from being "crippled" and out of the game without having a chance to do anything.  New players should buy the third edition game, because it has text on the cards explaining special abilities rather than icons.  Theme might be problematic for some folks (just rename the "Beer" card as the "Root Beer" card!).

Also have expansions:
[gameid=20237] (note: the next card should be face up so players can prepare for it, says the designer [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/73639#73639]here[/url].  Also check the [url=http://www.bang.cz/download/faq/FAQ_a_fistful_of_cards_eng.pdf]FAQ and Errata[/url].)

Can be over very fast, so beware! The need for a minimum of 4 players or more should also be noted if you're willing to give this a try. Plus, if someone is killed early, he's out for good and doomed to watch the others play - which can be a quite of a downer.

Funny party game but a bit too long sometime. Sometime games are really slow, other times they are pretty fast. A bit inconsistent. Also there are much cards, expecially if you put an expansion in, and so it's not very simple for "non-gamers", and since it's a party game I think it must be really enjoyable by everyone.

Anyway, I like the west theme, and is funny to play, so it deserves a medium vote for me.

Had this for awhile before playing it. It's good with 5 or more players (preferably with 7). It's also a good party game with non-gamers. Although, if playing with non-gamers, do it early instead of later. It's kinda like stretching before exercising.

Absolutely love this one, but it's a bit hard to teach, especially for people who don't play board/card games very often. Also, be ready to have other quicker-paced games on hand once people in a large game start getting eliminated, otherwise they'll be bored. That being said, when this game gets good, it's *really* good.

I never expected to have this much fun.  I mean there was a lot of hype here and I thought, "Sure, why not, I'll buy it... it's only 8 bucks..."  But when I finally got to play it (both six and seven player games) we had HUGE fun.  Maybe the best card game I've ever played.  The only thing I'm taking the score down for is the fact that you can get knocked out early and have to wait for 20 or 30 minutes just watching.  That's sad.  But the rest of it is HUGE, HUGE fun.

Best with more than five.  Good gateway game, but at least twice while explaining the rules to new players, I've said, "Ok, well, here's where I "Bang!" your wife..."

A fun "party" game with not too overly complex rules. It is very fun but has some mistakes. Mainly in a lot of players, if you die early you are looking for up to an hour of watching your friends playing while you basically do nothing. It is also highly random and there is no real strategy, just if you get the good cards or you don't.

NOTE: My "1" means "0"!!
This because in this game, when playng 5 or more, a player could be killed quickly ... so quickly that him/her will not play!

An example to explain a "1st round-killed-without play": 
- 1st player plays 'indians' (5th player is hit because if without a "bang");
- 2nd player plays 'indians' (5th player is hit because if without a "bang");
- 3rd player plays "bang" against 5th player (5th player is hit if without a "missed");
- 4th player plays "bang" against 5 player (5th player is hit if without a "missed"). 
... and finally ...
- 5th/last player is "KILLED WITHOUT PLAY", if without any card to protect himself!!!

Now: i call "game" the thing the lets you "play" with it ... Bang isn't a game!!!

* Played 10+ times. Good game for bigger group, can be as short as 20 minutes. Plays best with 7, but enjoyable with all numbers (less players goes by quicker so the duration-to-enjoyment ratio stays the same. A bit like Frank's Zoo with lightness, and quasi-teaming of players; a bit like Citadels in roles assigned and special abilities for each character. The designer also has 2-player and 3-play variants now and, though lighter and less interesting, are lightning quick, and still amusing, and a great way to introduce the game to a beginner.

So many of my gaming buddies have this game that I get to play this regularly.  After a few plays, my impression improved somewhat.  Bearing in mind this is a light game meant to be played with some attitude, there are a few points going for it.  First of all, there is a genuine challenge in winning with the renegade.  The hidden roles at the start of the game remind me of 5-player Tarot, and the quicker the sherif finds his vice determines how and where the game will go.  I tried some of the expansions and they really do add something new.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I would play the dice version of Bang any day over the card version. My experience with the card version has not been great. Games can be slow, drawn-out as a group, but may surprisingly be quick for some individuals. I once was eliminated very early on and then sat for longer than I had played the game watching it complete.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
got the core came, and loooved it, so I got the Bullet, but I was disappointed because I found the expansions to not be very fun or useful at all.  The best thing about the Bullet is the added number of characters to choose from. Though several of them work only with expansions. you still get another dozen or so to choose from.

The Bullet lets you play with 8 players instead of the max of 7 in the core game, but a deck of cards and a little creativity lets you play with 8 in the core game anyway.  One of the expansions of the Bullet solves the one draw back of Bang - getting eliminated early.  I have played a few games with 7 players where one person was killed before they even got their first turn.  Then they get to sit there for the next half hour watching people play.  It sucks.  The Bullet expansion allows killed players to have a go as a sort of "ghost" that gets a normal turn, but disappears from existence every time its not their turn.  However, this is something you can also do without actually owning any expansions.  Get the core game and you won't be disappointed.

Shadow Hunters is superior: there's actual information to make decisions on, and information flows onwards as your action imply other things.

It's less likely that you'll be singled out and killed without getting the chance to do anything.

The icons are confusing - there are more of them than in Race for the Galaxy!

My kids go crazy for this game!  It took me way too long to get the rules straight... Still, it's fun for a change of pace and everyone seems to like it.  It's one of my favorite fillers despite it's longer playing time.  People respond to the role playing side of it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Everyone new to this loves this. Who doesn't like killing their friends? Great, light fun. Great that it goes up to 8 with expansion. We often seem to have 1 too many for Citadels/Bohnanza and this one seems more fun for the masses. 

A little bit of a learning curve for non-gamers, but most people get completely comfortable by the 3rd-4th round - and they always want to keep playing - once they get past decoding the symbols/get familiar with the action cards and figuring out that distance thing (which is the most difficult thing in the game for new players).

My least favorite thing about this game is the player elimination but often, people are into the game enough that watching their team try to survive/win is still extremely gripping.

My roommate developed this 2-player variant that works well and we'll probably play that a few more times.

I find this game enjoyable for a few rounds, but then as people starting to get knocked out I find I just want it to end. I have played it once with 7-8 people and was in until the final 3. Even with that I found I wanted it to end and was jealous of the people who got out and were playing Spyfall. I would greatly enjoy this game if there was a way to speed it up once people started getting knocked out.

RATING: 7
Bang! is slow to learn, but after a couple of years of annual play (at Christmas, when visiting family) it's finally sunk in to the level where it's enjoyable.  The theme caries over some of the early difficulty, but the hard part is learning to play tactically and not to just shoot the person next to you because there's nothing else to do.  While you're trying to guess the identity of the other players a mechanism for communication other than shooting them may help improve the start of the game, as it is, you either fire or feel like you're waiting for tactical information that might never arrive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Fun game, but often takes a long time to explain to new players. Unless you have a focused and quick learning game group, games can stretch out a long time as players will get distracted while waiting for their turn to come around.

That said, I do enjoy a wild west shootout with friends.

I think this is a great game for a bunch of heavier gamers that are looking for a filler.  But I've had problems playing this with newbies - there are a lot of rules for something this light.  You have to play it with the "spaghetti western" attitude of not taking things too seriously, and play your cards pretty quick.  If you're agonizing over which card to play, you're probably playing this in a different spirit than was intended.
UPDATE: My kids love this game, and it is a lot more fun than it should be for someone who doesn't care for a lot of chaos.  I'm bumping it up a notch in the ratings.

Basically a card game version of Werewolf/Mafia.

I love playing this on my iPhone, but I don't like it as much in person due to player elimination and the need for a large number of players. It can be impractical to play since you really need at least 5 people for an enjoyable game. The 3-player variant is boring, and 4-player Bang is horribly imbalanced in favor of the outlaws.

Don't expect a deep game.

RATING: 4
Can be very wonky and it rarely turns out to be a satisfying game, but it's easy to teach and the theme/mechanics sometimes grab people. It can be a satisfying social experience even when the game falls flat; Not dissimilar to Arkham Horror in that respect, except it's much less fiddly, shorter (still way over-long for my taste) and appeals to a broader audience.

A quick filler game where each player has a hidden role (except the sheriff) and take turns shooting the other players.  The game is hampered by confusing card design where cryptic pictures are substituted for a handful of words.  This makes explaining the rules for this simple short game rather ardous.  The gameplay is interesting if a bit unstrategic.  Getting 2 character to choose from adds a bit of interest.

Sokak által ismert, és általánosságban nagyon kedvelt játék. Én szívesen játszom vele nagyobb társaságban, de mint játék azért annyira nem nyűgöz le, mivel nem sokáig maradhat titokban, hogy ki kivel van. Ha meg nagyon jól titkolod, hogy ki vagy, akkor meg a haverjaid lőnek le. 
A karakterek nincsnek túl jól kiegyensúlyozva. A Kid túl erős. Emiatt eleinte mindenki vele volt. Aztán rájöttünk, hogy milyen erős. Most ha valaki ki meri magának választani, akkor azt a többiek az első körben kinyírják, mert nem kockáztatja meg senki se, hogy ellene legyen. :)

Bang! can be a lot of stupid fun, but that's easily cancelled out by players with AP. Since you need a bigger group to play properly it must be played quickly, or half the table will wander off or play something else on the side.

I've recently found enough people to let this hit the table again. It's a lot of fun with the hidden role cards, the lying, and the heartbreaking deception. I thought it would be harder to teach than it was, but it just needs one really slow practice round where people are always passing around the rules for special-card reference.

RATING: 3
Because everyone's gun has a "range", everyone starts the game only able to shoot their immediate neighbors until they get a better gun or horse. This prevents everyone from ganging up on one person at the beginning of the game normally. I like this.

I rated this a 7 in 2009, but by 2012 I was wise to its ways. It's really hard to teach to a certain type of person. Some people don't know what to do strategy wise, the concept of take-that is lost on them. Non gamers struggle with the gamer logic, like how this game has hit points and how the range mechanic works. The deduction part proves boring. Finally, Bang! often devolves into a slugfest at the end between the sheriff and someone else. This game is outgunned by Family business because its harder to learn and not very interesting. Resistance is a much better deduction game. I'm moving it to a 3. 

Another thing. I play with a patient group. When three players are left, the Sheriff will just sit there passing the whole time while the two others duke it out, because of course one of them is a deputy and the other is a renegade. When the winner claws his or her way out of the dust-up the full health Sheriff just blows them away.

I sold my copy in 2014. I've heard that Bang: The Dice Game is good though.

Card Game
Players take on hidden roles of law or criminal along with being a unique character.
Cards are used to play items, shoot at people, or other defensive/offensive actions.
Sheriff and Deputies try to kill the outlaws and renegade, outlaws try to kill everyone else; renegade tries to kill the sheriff last.

Bang! suffers seriously from player elimination issues. I only played it once, but it was an awful experience. I got eliminated 10 minutes in the game, and then had to watch for over an hour the other players' antics. It seemed they liked it a bit more than I did, but not a lot more.

In the old west, a new sheriff comes to town and has to figure out who the deputies are.  Other players are deputies, outlaws trying to shoot the sheriff, or the renegade - who wants to be the sheriff himself.

Good game, but always seems to take longer than advertised.  Also, way tougher to teach than you'd expect.

Update: Okay, I still like playing this game, but I hate teaching it.  Teaching this game is as bad as teaching Twilight Struggle.  It's far simpler, but at least with Twilight Struggle the other players expect it to be hard to learn.

The Spaghetti Western card game so thematic the cards are in Italian.  Well, in earlier editions at least, but that's good enough for me.  I like the Are You A Werewolf? style game play of trying to figure out who's who a lot more when it has guns and random cards.  Not a game to be taken seriously but always a hoot, especially with a full complement of seven players.  Avoid the expansions like the plague, however, as they serve no purpose but to make the game longer and less fun.  Okay, some of the new characters are fun, but that's about it.

First I found this game intriguing, then frustrating and now I am neutral towards it. In my opinion this is a very easy and random game, and should not be taken seriously at all.

(Especially if you're the sheriff)

I've now played it several times with different numbers of players. It is great fun. I think the more players the better, but have not tried it with less. With 4, the Outlaw might be at a disadvantage. I would consider balancing this by giving the Sheriff 1 less card (to a minimum of 1) per life point. The main consideration for this game is the mix of players. Get the right players and it is an 8.5. Get the wrong mix and it is a boring 3! With fun-loving players who are not in the mood for serious fare this will be a hit.

Finally got to play this one.  Six players was good light fun.  Plan to try with the expansions.    Seems like it would suffer greatly with less than five or six, though.  

Update: Played with all the expansions (that now come together in a cool-looking bullet-shaped box).  Moves fast, no heavy thinking involved.  Great with six players.

Update again: Slight downgrade to 6.  Defensive play can cause the game to drag, and combined with early player elimination(s), this can be really bad and turned my group off of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Purchased 9/01/2005


Nice, light filler.  Some kills feel so anti-climatic..."Oh, I'm dead.  Hmm..."

Plus, deducing roles isn't that difficult.


Needs the full compliment if 7--gets worse as the number of players decrease.  The 4-player version is particularly awful--why would you even bother to play it that way?

It's marketing, man...putting "requires 7" on the box is sales suicide.


UPDATE:  Played it twice since then, and it still manages to be a ton of fun.  Watched a player blow himself up with dynamite, another player constantly get put in jail, beer and bullets flying everywhere...this is a great game.

The icons can cause some problems getting used to (blame that on the ALMIGHTY LANGUAGE INDEPENDENCE~!) but it doesn't take too long to puzzle through.



UPDATE:  Oddly, this gets a little less fun every time I play it.  Those first few games were hilarious.  Maybe we just have had a bad run the past couple of games.

Everyone seems to like it, so I end up playing it pretty often. It's quick and it's time spent gaming, which is better than watching TV, but honestly it's not a very good game. Your moves are pretty obvious given your hand generally, the secret roles are usually not secret anymore after turn one, and too often it ends up dragging on between the sheriff and some other guy while the rest of us make small talk. On the plus side, you get to take a silly american accent and pretend to be a cowboy, so there's that.

One of my friends' favorites back in the Netherlands. Wouldn't play without the expansions again since they add some more spice to the game. The game can be a bit frustrating though with the wrong people or when a game goes on and on when you are eliminated early.

Also own:
-Dodge City: More cards and a few new mechanics.
-A Fistful of Cards: I really like these cards that shake up every turn with a different rule (except for maybe the card "A Fistful of Cards" that usually ends the game randomly.

A very engaging Hidden role game, but as with most Hidden role games, group spontaneity really does affect the experience a lot.

I really like the game if it is played fast and furious; it gives a Mexican Standoff vibe.

However in my experience, when players tend to get too good, the game bogs down and slow down as players tend to over analyse decisions, and this somewhat kills thematic experience

Lots of random card action, but the secret role cards are genius.  Can get dull if people just hole up.

+++7.0

Update - reduced to a 6.  Games as random as this where people can be knocked out early are not my cup of tea.  Since I tend to be regarded as the 800 lb. gorilla in my gaming group, my chances to win are usually zero.  In most games I don't mind (since I usually play for fun, not just to win) but when Bang hits the table it usually means I get to spend the greater part of an hour sitting out of the game.

Bang! needs some serious tweaking to prevent it dragging out for hours, nor do language-independent symbols that don't entirely explain the card and leave you reaching for the rulebook help.  Both the gunfight mechanic and Mafia/Werewolf aspect are fun, and should be even better together, but the deck has too many Missed! and Beer cards.  I have cannibalized my Bang! deck for a homemade Cash'n Guns set.

RATING: 2.5
Barely acceptable only for 5 or 7 players.  The deduction part of this game only really comes into play when there are 7 players, or after all Outlaws are dead and you are looking for the Renegade.  It REALLY sucks when you're out of the game before you have your [-]second[/-] first turn.  Ten minutes of waiting followed by 20 minutes of waiting for the others to finish their game!  Fun!  I also had a game in which I was jailed the first turn, and the second turn, and blown up with dynamite on the third.  Exciting!  The decisions are rarely difficult and card draw is a MUCH more significant factor than any of those decisions.

I so very much wanted to like this, but it only disappointed.

My gateway game; deception is very fun, relatively fast, definitely plays better with more people (6 is perfect - 1 sheriff, 1 vice, 1 renegade, 3 outlaws), but depending on players downtime may get excessive with more than 6. As long as the beginning has little to no stalemate, game should be fast and fluid. Not a game you should expect to win at (or taken personally if eliminated), but if you can overcome these small downsides the game should be fun.

When it first came out it was amongst our favourite games, but it slowly (yet inexorably) declined to little more than a party game: the hidden role mechanism shines with 5+ players, yet a 5+ game can potentially be very long. And this is particularly bad for a player-elimination game.

I give it a 7 (and not a 5) because we enjoy it houseruled with 2 players.

Bang! has a problem: It's too predictable and you will often know not just who got each role but also the aproximated content of their hand in less than a turn. And since one influences the other, once you know that about a player you can easily see deduce what the other players are doing.

So the game ends up being quite shallow as efficiency trumps bluffing.

For that reason I only bring it out when I have new people around.

One of the best gamer for funny accents, tough. :)

Got this for the family gaming time over the Christmas holiday and it was the hit of the holidays. Light enough for kids to play the game, though it does have Beer cards in it if thats an issue with the kids, as well as the overall theme of a Western shootout. But with a quick pace to the game after you've played it once, a bit of roleplaying, and unique strategies throughout, definitely a nice find.

Fun with the right group of people.  A lot of luck but the distance factors, roles and special abilities make things very unpredictable and you feel like you're never out of a game until you really have been eliminated.  I especially like the weakening effect of having less cards in your hand as you lose hit points.

The game takes a bit longer than it should though.

Even if it's rather a party game, I love this one and would like to get a hand of it. Probably best with 7, but has the disadvantage as the players are eliminated from the game.

There is something very attractive with this spaghetti western theme, especially when the cards are written in Italian. And I sure did enjoy the game at first, just for the sake of the hilariously well made theme and the cards alone. But underneath I found a game that at the same time is very frustrating.

To explain this to new players you have to go through all the symbols, which is unpractical. Some of the symbols even have a book icon where you have to look in the rulebook to understand. The learning curve of the game is steep; still the game is quite random and light.

While each individual turn is quite fast, it will drag on when playing with many players. Still there is most fun out of the game with many players as there are more to deduce. The deduction is in itself nice, but it becomes pretty apparent after a while.

If it is over fast, I have probably enjoyed the game. It can however be hard to kill another player, especially when you are out of good cards. When the game drag, it is not fun, especially for the players who are eliminated.

What can I say...I started the BANG! revolution... This game is pretty much the catalyst that started my insane gaming addiction. I don't know why, but I randomly came upon this and played it with friends. We must have had 2 months straight of weekend BANG! gaming till 4-5am. I'm rather proud that within a month, 3-4 of my friends had the game. They were mad when I wasn't around to play it, therefore, they couldn't play it either. I'm happy to say I was the cause for the G.P. staying sold out of this game for over a month. Then Munchkins came along...

Oh, and if my younger brother asks...tell him it's rootbeer. That's the only problem I kinda have with this game. I wish there was a younger kid's addition. (I know, this is very impractical) Fortunately, Nathen still thinks it's rootbeer yet...

This is another game that is great with either 6 or 7 people, because it's much harder to figure out what roles people are because early on the game some people can't even attack everyone else due to the distance of their gun.

Karácsonyra lepte meg vele magát a család. Az akkori szentestén a szilvesztert is letudtuk.

Egyik kedvenc partijátékom. Szórakoztató de a lapokkal és a karaktereknek marad hely a könnyed taktikázásra is.
Egyetlen játék amit nem sikerült még mindig rendesen megtanulnom: a szabálykönyvben még mindig találok újat. De kit érdekel. A Bang azok közé a játékok közé tartozik, amit a játszás élvezetéért szeretek játszani.

Update: 5 év és megannyi más játék megismerése után azt kell mondjam, hogy az újdonság varázsa fogott meg. Egy ideje már nem érzem izgalmasnak, hogy egy körön át tűrve a pofonokat várok a soromra. Nálam nem tudott az idő múlásával nemesedni. A szívózós party játékok műfajában volt szerencsém izgalmasabb darabokhoz is.

A great game. Easy to learn, quick to play, and nobody especially minds that it's so luck-based. It's great fun gunning eachother down with our scope-horse-winchesters, and successfully bluffing the Sheriff is a great thrill. The flaws are that some of the characters are simply bad, downtime increases as more players join in, and you nred to gather together a relatively large group of people who don't mind sitting out when they get eliminated.

Bang! is a relatively light, chaotic game.  For being a light game, the rules take a bit of time to digest (particularly for those unfamiliar with MtG/CCG type games) and your first game will probably go slowly.  

The cards are on good quality stock, but the art is certainly nothing to write home about and doesn't add much to the game.

The game can be fun, but the special abilities of the characters seem unbalanced.

A sör gyógyít, a nők meglopnak.
A poros vadnyugati kisváros csendjét, eddig nyugodt életét pisztolylövések zaja zavarja meg. Sheriffünknek nincs könnyű dolga, ki kell deríteni ki vagy kik törnek az életére. Tényleg a Dalton banda tagjai, vagy a híres Névtelen renegát vagy csak önkéntes helyettese pufogtat a főutcán? Közben folyik a sör, táncolnak a lányok, érkeznek a postakocsik. A város nagy túlélője, a Koporsókészítő pedig már méretre vágta az alapanyagot.
Játékosszámtól függően a Sheriff, a Banditák, a Renegát vagy Renegátok, illetve a Helyettes vagy Helyettesek próbálják meg céljaikat elérni ebben a kártyajátékban. Próbálsz felszerelkezni, védekezni a lövések, betévedő indiánok, polgárháborús hatcsövű gatling ellen, de vigyáznod kell a szép hölgyekre is.
A játék elején mindenki megkapja titkos szerepét, majd a Sheriff felfedi magát és kezdődik a tánc (farkasokkal). Körödben kártyát húzol, majd a kezedben lévő lapokban rejlő lehetőségeket kombinálva törsz sikerre. Általában vagy felhúzod, amit szeretnél vagy nem. Így Fortuna istenasszony is domináns szerepet játszik a fordulók során.
Sajnos minél többször sebesülsz meg, annál kevesebb az esélyed gyorsan talpra állni és ezt a lehetőséget ellenfeleid sem fogják kihagyni. Egy-egy jól megválasztott karakterrel (a játékban vannak hasznosabb és kevésbé hasznosabbak is) esélyeid megnőnek.
A játék számomra egyik nagy negatívuma, amikor az első körök egyikében a többiek kilőnek, majd egyes esetekben nagyon hosszú holtidő telik el a játék vége előtt. Természetesen valakinek ez nem probléma, én azonban szeretem minimálisra venni a holtidőt, ha ez lehetséges. Ilyen szempontból a játék kockásított változatát jobban szeretem. Valamint bizonyos játékosszámnál (kifejezetten 4 főnél) a játék amúgy is törékeny egyensúlya teljesen megbomlik.
Partijátéknak mindenképpen ideális, főleg, mivel magyar nyelven is elérhető. Ha van lehetőség a választásra, számomra marad a kocka Bang. Bár itt a már megjelent kiegekben található további lehetőségek is változtathatnak a megfelelő változat kiválasztásában.

RATING: 6.5
There's variety in the cards but that means you need to play once to get a feel for the game.  For such a light game that takes away a bit of the appeal since it's harder for new players to jump in.  Some of the character abilities seem a bit off balanced.  Otherwise it's a fun game.

Deduction styled game mixed with a take that card game and teams. Nothing like it. Really a wonderful, gateway card game. Many nongamers love this game and can attach to it quickly. This was one of my firsts after Catan and TTR. The dice game has streamlined the game and brought down the play time to about 15 mins so I would definitely recommend that version first, but this one still has its charm and is a little less luck based without the dice

The more I exist around this, the more I realise that it's too long and a TERRIBLE game to play with casual gamers. The couple of times I tried it failed pretty badly and watching others play it for the first time is painful. This explains why my rating has dropped from an 8 to a 5 since I first played it. Never has a game fallen so far from grace in my gaming life....except the usual suspects.

The worst thing it that you need more players to make it better, but more players slows it down and therefore also makes it worse. You can die before you even get to have a turn. UGHHHHHH.

RATING: 6
It is hard for me to give very high marks to a game you can lose before you get a turn, but it is hard for me to give low marks to a game that takes Werewolf and makes it even cooler. Far from balanced, but tons of fun. Surprisingly quick to learn with a good teacher, but don't get bogged down explaining every card. Let people play it and see what it does. Be lighthearted, and don't be afraid to shoot your best friend and you will have a great time with this. 

UPDATE:
This has fallen in the rankings for me as the Bang Dice Game delivers much the same experience without overstaying its welcome at higher player counts.

Sokan tudnak játszani vele, de a kiesett sokszor halálra tudja unni magát. Lehet be kéne vezetni a különleges lapokat... Egyébként a sheriffnek egyedül is van esélye, csak jó karakter és fegyver függvénye. Sajnos tapasztalatból tudom.

This game isn't as bad as I thought it was going to be (e.g. it's not as bad as Cash and Guns).  But it does have some flaws:
- just like in Mafia, once you get knocked out of the game, all you can do is sit and watch (or start another game)
- it's not that deductive of a game as you might think, since we all start with no information, and we eventually start to attack someone who might be our ally
- some combinations of cards and roles are too good at defence and poor at offence, and when that happens, the game can go on forever

A game where a player is kicked out before having the chance to say or do anything is broken; I've seen that in action, had myself  killed shortly afterwards to play some two players with the victim.

A very interesting and fast playing card game.  Players get to "defend" by hiding being a barel or playing "missed" cards.

Can be great fun. However, like Citadels, with too slow a group, this game feels like it drags on forever (especially if you get shot down early in the game).

--------------------------------------------
Update: October 2015

The game is also pretty crude in its presentation of "Indians" and how they mechanically come to play a part in the game. I've downgraded the rating as I think I'll probably actively avoid the game for both its thematic and its mechanical application.

A great game with a larger group (5-7).  There does seem to be a tilt toward the sheriff and deputy winning, and the renegade is clearly the most daunting role to play.  Drawbacks are that some character powers seem a bit over the top compared to the others, the overly strong position of the sheriff if seated next to a deputy or the renegade, and the possibility of early elimination for one or more players. But the game is loads of fun with the right group, reasonably fast, and holds lots of tension and flavor.

You have a starting hand, and if your turn comes draw two cards. You are going to make the simplest choice of your life, and play out some cards.

After all i can't give a higher vote for such a waste of time.

The hidden roles are fun while they last (maybe a few turns).  The characters special abilities add a bit of flavor.  The "Mancato" cards make the game needlessly drag on.  Tip : It's in the outlaws best interest to attack the sheriff ASAP.  If they don't, the sheriff just has to slowly deplete every other players health so that the sheriff can easily kill the outlaws when they reveal themselves by shooting at him.

The pleasure-density of this game is so off the charts I swear the cards are made of an alloy of Ununoctium and molten fun.  Yes, it has player elimination.  Yes, it is almost pure chaos.  So play it like a party game—we've rarely had a game go beyond 30 minutes.  Remember, it's called [i]BANG![/i], not "Marshall Resources".  

UPDATE:  I've seen the Renegade win plenty of big games.  It's tough—it's the most difficult role to play—but it just means you have to be extra double-plus crafty with a corpse's poker face and expert timing.  Quit whining and embrace the challenge.

UP-UPDATE:  Huh—it turns out the 4p game is actually interesting...  The Renegade knows from the get-go who the two Outlaws are and the Sheriff can start shooting willy-nilly on the first turn.  Once the first Outlaw goes down there's an interesting dynamic where the remaining Outlaw can offer to help the Sheriff to keep from getting double-teamed...

And, if nothing else, it goes [i]quick![/i]

RATING: 5
Random, funny and paranoic... The problem is that it´s not very strategical, and gets repetitive after some plays.

This game is just OK, but has been overrated and hyped in the past because the "role mechanic" was trendy with Eurogamers.

Normally I don't mind player elimination, but in "Bang!" this is a big issue. A player will be likely killed in the first turns, (without deserving it), and then the game will drag on forever because the game offers no incentive to attacking other players, and turtling is the best tactic.

Car Wars: the Cardgame makes the same in less time and solves the player elimination problem (the duels are so quick that you don't mind being eliminated).

UPDATE: Playing with roles can be funny at first, but then you realize that the Renegade cannot win, and every play tends to be the same. Try to play without roles, everyone versus everyone, as "Mag-Blast" or "Car Wars".

Véleményem szerint az egyik legjobb parti játék. Hátránya, hogy kiesés játék, azaz könnyen lehet, hogy valaki kiesik az elején és utána a többiek még sokáig játszanak, azaz a kieső unatkozni fog. Nagy előnye, hogy rengeteget lehet közben dumálni, hülyéskedni, ez segít azon is, hogy az emberek ne vegyék túl komolyan, hogy egymásra lövöldöznek.  

Az eredeti értékből le kellett vonnom:
- egyrészt csak gyakorlott játékosokkal jó játszani
- egy jó játékhoz legalább 5-7 ember kell
- a kiesők sokáig csak unatkoznak

Card game with relatively easy rules (although a bit fiddly), neat artwork and strong theme. While I can see why some people may not like it, it's really fun to play when everyone is into it. Player elimination is balanced by games usually being short.
We find it best with 6 players.

UPDATE: Still very fun with right group!

A game to play w/ friends. Lots of fun playing, but it gets really good only when your table is full (i.e.: with all 7  players), otherwise it'll lose a great amount of the fun in the game. That makes it hard to play often.

A really great game for a group of 5+ (IMHO) when you need a lighter party type game, but you're tired of Apples to Apples, Taboo, and Cranium.

It's the classic of this type(hidden identity + PvP fight). As long as one does not hate PvP and somewhat chaos game, it works extremely well.

The game is accessible for newcomers -- a huge plus.
Supporting of high player count -- another huge plus.

Slightly too long for a game with possibilities of early-elimination.

A decent negotiation/traitor deduction game.  Strategy is fairly straightforward without any expansions (always try to eliminate anybody who might not be on your side, as its better to eliminate a possible ally than leave a possible outlaw alive).  "Distance" (from being on a horse) and ranges of weapons is an interesting mechanic.  Some cards are much more powerful than others, so there's quite a bit of luck... and if you get eliminated early (e.g. in the first round due to bad starting hand, too weak OR too strong of an identity, and awkward position relative to the Sheriff), or can't shoot anyone because your neighbours are on horses and you can't draw a weapon or scope, it can be boring.  Unfortunately the dominant early strategy is "attack everyone in range", and it can take a while before anyone can really deduce anything.

1st played Oct 10th, 2007. Rules explaination 10min, length 45min. There are so many types of cards, it takes a while to determine what each do. A gameplay or two is needed to get acquainted. Screams cheatsheet. Played w/6 players who previously played. I played sherrif since it's easiler for newbies to learn. Game recommended for larger group of players. Each player is dealt a character and a role. All chars have special abilities. Roles: Sherrif, deputy, outlaw or renegade. Sherrif also gets one extra hit point and starts game. On your turn you draw a card and then play cards. Cards can be equipment to allows you to shoot beyond the player to your left or right. There are action cards that let you draw cards as well. You can only play one "bang" card (shoots one person). They can play a miss card. You can also play a duel card which allows you to play bang cards until you run out or you finally hit. You can also play a whiskey (heal) card. Hand limit is the number of hit points you have left. Sherrif wins by killing the outlaws and renegades. Outlaws win by killing sherrif. I'd recommend giving this a try if you know someone who has it and have enough players to support the game. It's a good fun game, however it may test your patience with learning the ropes.

Ultimately, Bang is fun but deeply flawed.  The player elimination can be very quick (and foul-tasting), luck of the draw is a bit overwhelming, some of the characters have balance issues, and the endgame is quite frankly, retarded.  The two remaining players simply enter into a competition of "draw the right combo" to end it.  If there was a way to diminish these blemishes, my rating would sky-rocket.  Not too bad as is though which is an accomplishment considering the downfalls.

Update:  The downfalls do in fact ruin this stupid game.  Someone is always garunteed to get shat upon whether by dying before they get a turn or by being put in jail over and over again.  The game can also lock up pretty easily and the luck of the draw is highly annoying for such a long game with player elimination.  The renegade is also impossible to play most of the time.  Ugh, I'd need some serious convincing to ever try this mess again any time in the near to distant future.  Blech.

Seems to work great for Boy Scout activities.  Take it from there.  After playing Sabotuer though, I doubt I'll pull Bang out very often.

If you are going to make a social deduction, hidden role party game, for doge's sake make it possible to figure out a damn role before someone dies. On top of that, even if someone is that special kind of stupid to tip their hand before 2-3 players have been eliminated, you could be in taken out by random BS like dynamite. Or Indians. Or anyone having a bad day.

Expansion does not make this more tolerable. Artificial deck/hand size fattening with the all-too-pleasant effect of making yourself a target if the effect is that strong. Play a better game that actually generates engaging table talk, like Shadow Hunters or the new Emergence. This also made me want to play Deception in HK...and I do not even enjoy it. Leave this old trash for the kids that do not know any better.

I like this game, but I can't lie at all for the best of them. I always get shot first even if I am the deputy.

I didn't like the player elimination aspect, and the hand size seemed a little too small.

I'd play again (not several times in one sitting though), but can't see myself buying it

Great Game!  Different roles, different characters and a colourful variety of other cards makes for a non-repetitive, highly entertaining shoot out.  The game is fast, easy to pick up and does an excellent job implementing the "wild west" theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fun concept for a game, and I definitely like the western theme. However, the game (as I last played it a while ago, maybe they've adjusted the rules some) is pretty broken without having some significant house rules added to the game. Actions that can be taken are dictated too much by one's position in the circle (which is totally random), and the game can take FOREVER in some instances. And when people are knocked out within the first turn of a 2 hour game...

It just doesn't work as a light filler-type game in most circumstances. And it doesn't have the muscle to make a long game worthwhile. It can be fun, but I'd rather take my chances on another game almost always.

Potentially a fun game, but this very much depends on the group of players. With a group of experienced gamers, I find it unsatisfyingly light - too high an element of chance, and too little opportunity for tactical card play. With a group of newbies, it can take a while to explain the functions of the various cards and the pace of play can be far too slow.

What can I say?  Bang! is great.

It captures the feeling of the Spaghetti Western, is different every time, can be played with lots of players, and a game is pretty quick.  We can usually play this one twice before moving on to another game.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND using bullet shells as life counters, especially since the bullets on the back of the cards have a habit of sliding accidently during gameplay (We reserve five silver ones for the Sheriff).

If I have ONE gripe, it's that the horse cards are confusing.  The description on the cards cause us to have a hard time remembering if the horse is taking you clear of danger, or faster to catch up to someone you're chasing.  Often in our games, someone has to argue, "Naw, tha's a runnin' TO horse, not a runnin' AWAY horse!"  Simply having the artwork on the cards showing a horse and rider running away from a posse, or running after a varmint would remedy this.

Cards game where every player has a unique role that, except for the sheriff, remain as a secret until the end of the game. Every role has a different way of winning. The role is combined with a unique character. There are characters that fit every role but there are others that is just the opposite. If, when dealing the characters, you receive 2 characters that don't really fit with your role, you will have a problem.
The game is easy to explain, easy to play and it may be fun, and I explain this, but it depends on how fast the players play. If you have one truly slow player, it is a nightmare, because the mechanics have been thought for playing fast. 
Bang has one of the worst rules that can apply to any game, which is the "sofa" rule, you are dead, ok go and watch tv for a while. Having said that, in this game is not as critical as in Risk, for instance. If the killed player is the sheriff, the game is over and a new round can be played, if not, it shouldn't take more than 15 minutes to finish the round, which should be fine.
Positive:
1. Easy to explain and play
2. Recommended for every type of player
3. The secret roles are a good idea, however, it doesn't take too long to identify every one
4. Many rounds can be played in a short time
Negative:
1. The character of the sheriff has to suit the role, if not, the round can be finished even before the sheriff has played 2 turns
2. A minimum of 4 players is required
3. The "sofa" rule, even thought it is not as critical in this game
4. The risk of having an "slow player", this is not on the game but on the group of players, but, please, play fast this game, you shooting guns, not writing poems (with all due respect)

I've heard some complaints about the limited ability of being able to affect only the players sitting next to you, but I actually like this rule. It makes the theme of having short range and long range weapons make a lot more sense. Also, the not knowing who each player is can be quite fun- unless you're playing with someone who just doesn't get their role. Often a hilarious game! Not as good as Resistance, but a lot of fun none the less.

Good for debating / arguing skills. Intermediate to advanced ESL. I use cards with Korean on them, and play the game in English with students. My students would rate this game as a 10. 

I think the issue with it is that players can be eliminated very early on and then are forced to watch the rest of the game which may drag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very light fun game for a large group, suffers from the same problems as Werewolf, if your killed off early there is nothing left for you to do. Also, getting put in jail really sucks too, I like the concept but it should be a little easier to get out, or like Monopoly you get out after 3 turns, otherwise huge snoozefest with severe downtime for this person. If your not in Jail or dead, this is a fun game.

Update: 6.5 => 6 No real desire to play but I still would if asked

Fun game to play with a group who can handle a game with some "screw-your-neighbor" tactics.  The 2nd ed rules are clearer and only add more thrills to the game.  After a few hands, you'll start to see the wheels turning in most player's heads as they become more devious with their roles.

RATING: 6
Initially hesitation to shoot anyone (because you are afraid of killing the wrong person) can stall the fun in this game. There is something good here, but I think the players have to have the right mindset or it becomes to pondering and not enough chaotic fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This game is a lot like the game Mafia (Mafia is not a board game in case you're wondering) but it is less fun.  In Mafia you can try to convince everyone why you are or are not part of the Mafia.  Plus, the killing is done in secret whereas in Bang! the shooting is all public.

To me it is too easy to figure out who is playing which role in Bang! - the Renegade is the only player with any ambiguity to it.  Also, you are so limited in who you can attack and when you can attack that it becomes boring.

This game is terribly tedious and is only good for playing with people who don't enjoy any other games.  Please don't make me play this game again!

Bang! has a really great pace and the deck is really well put together.  I also like that all of the identity powers are very different but none of them are particularly amazing and none of them are going to put you at a disadvantage.  The only thing that bothers me about Bang! is that if you draw the roll of renegade you are very unlikely to win.  It seems like the renegade was only included confuse the otherwise bland competition between sheriff and bandit.  Still, the secret identity mechanic is very effective even with a small group.

Is sort of interesting, trying to figure out who is whom.  Some amount of paranoia.  You can also build yourself up with stuff.  Character powers can be a bit unbalanced.  Somehow didn't click for me.  Felt more like guessing at who to shoot and maybe you get it right and maybe not.  Ditto everyone else maybe guns you down and maybe not, based on not much info.  Felt more like a light party game than a gamer game, but a little complicated for non-gamers.  Played without any expansions and first edition.  Maybe it got better later on?

BANG! is just too luck heavy and too long for what it is. Player elimination is a serious problem here as there's no guarantee of a short wait to play again. There are many better light hidden role games out there - pass on this one.

Good game...
the shooting range is a nice touch...

Three things though.
Sherif playing first isn't really an advantage, as he's going to shoot in the blind, possibly hurting one of his own crew.  And can you really pass on the opportunity to shoot?  you might be dead next turn...

Downtime.  Games can be long, and you can die fast.  Watching isn't as fun as playing

Rules are missing some things...you can't have two weapons...but can you have two horses ?  It is not specificly said that you can't have 2 or more of the same/similar equipment.

Fun group game, but MUST have 4  players for it to work...

Or halving the amount of beer.

beer cards\saloon cards only played once


player aids for card symbols



I should note that we house-rule that you can Dynamite anybody instead of placing it in front of you for a turn. This puts it into play one turn sooner, and introduces a little more strategy into an otherwise randomized event. I think this adds a lot to the game and makes it play a bit faster



3) DEFINITELY get rid of the Saloon and other non-original Beer cards,
4) Allow the variation to throw the Dynamite elsewhere rather than it starting in front of you,
5) Only allow one horse per player just like the rules limit one weapon per player,


Great game! Need to keep people moving though cause it can drag. Slower group should play to 7 buildings. Popular variant is to tone down the assain by having assinated character still collect income but otherwise lose turn.

I game I have greatly enjoyed for quite a while now. Its sweet spot is four players (a recent 6-player game had too much downtime), but 2 or 3 also works well.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (August 2008)

Bang! Could be a very good game for many people, but not for me. I dislike the theme, the game is too long for what it offers, if you are killed first it really sucks, moreover if you are dead BEFORE you take your first turn. It offers no interesting decisions, still it can be fun with the right group. However, the worst offender for me is that Bang! has lots and lots of downtime, that killed the game for me.  I also dislike the prison card, in more games it sucks to lose a turn, in Bang! is criminal as you will probably be dead before you play again.

The hidden roles are ok, the Renegade has it very hard to win a game, I have yet not seen that.

Bottom line, I love hidden roles games but I will do my best to stay away from this game, I prefer to play The Resistance or BSG if there is time. I won’t ever buy this game.

Has some merit as a party game or ice breaker.  The one time it hit with out group I only had one turn...so I sat watching the action for around a half hour or forty-five minutes.  Not a travesty in my book but some folks may have a low tolerance for this.  For a high number of players there are other types of this game I'd prefer to play (Werewolf, Incan Gold, Resistance, For Sale come to mind).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Wasn't as quick as I thought (at least in first playing, with expansion), probably would have been easier to learn if someone had played before. Seemed repetitive and quite random - the three outlaws spent most of the game in jail (and consequently they didn't feel like they were playing anything) - as deputy I was adjacent to the sheriff and could only shoot at the renegade on my other side - never saw a weapon - finally played a dynamite (which was fun, but of course, it killed me after one cycle of the players) - and so I got to twiddle while the others finished - Outlaws won - still not sure if the sheriff should be allowed to be put in jail and if you can shoot at people in jail (and perhaps, if an outlaw is in jail, they should lose their hideout card).. Not a great gaming experience...

RATING: 2.1
This is a really dumb game.  It doesn't have much strategy, so you really have to compare it with party games, but the rules are pretty complex for such a simple game, and people get knocked out early, and have to wait around for everyone else to finish.
UPDATE: OK - I had to increase the rating by 0.1, because it is categorically better than Inn-Fighting.

RATING: 2
I think this game totally sucks.  It's hard for newbies to figure out the symbols on the cards, people can get eliminated early and have to wait around for an eternal time, possibly, there's a highly variable game length, too much hidden information for everyone except knowing the id. of the Sheriff, etc.  I have no desire to play it and the only reason it gets rated here is I have been forced to endure multiple playings of this when I was unable to prevail on others in the group to try another game.  So I imagine I will be roped into playing it again some time (usually at sessions where I can't leave since I am the host), but I seriously don't see anything to cause my rating to go up.  What's weird is that the company that produced this "hit" (pardon the pun), DaVinci Games, has recently produced a really fine game, Leonardo da Vinci, and that's one I will be playing alot.

I really like this game, but I have really struggled to play it. It's not very popular at my games club. I think it's a quick fun game. perfect for the end of session game, but they are all into 6 Nimit so that gets played, week after week.

I keep meaning to try it at a family gathering, especially with children around I think it could be a big hit.

RATING: 5
People think that there is a strong deduction/bluffing factor in this game but it's absolutely false. Everyone's role becomes clear in two turns. The rest is a matter of almost brainless shooting. Who draws the best cards wins. And also games can be long, so hope to not be eliminated in the early stage. (Comment based on uncountable plays including tournaments). Still it's good to have in collection because it usually appeals to new non-boardgamers and hence can be the starting point to give birth to new boardgamers.

This game has a tendancy to drag at the end. The first half hour where 6-8 players a playing is a lot of fun. But when 4 or so folks get killed and the last 45 minutes is just 2 or 3 people trying to kill each other, it can get boring. The game could use a better end game mechanic.

A wild, wild west card game.  My first problem is the western.  It's really a product of a different generation, where old white guys that drank whiskey or milk ran Mexican bandits out of town.  Remember the gold ol' days when you could just shoot a guy for looking at you funny?  Uh no and those were the good ol' days.  The card game actually captures that.  You're shooting at people that could be outlaws or they could be your own deputy.  Knowing which is which would make shooting the other guy not as challenging.

Fun with the right persons. Should be played with the Dodge City expansion and preferrably also High Noon and/or A Fistful of Cards expansions in order to get it more dynamic and decrease risk of drag. The game has a problem with early player elemination which Bang! The dice game gets rid of.

RATING: 5
This is a decent little game that brings out hidden nuances in your friends.  However, the constant referal to the rulebook to find out what all the symbols mean just tied this game up and left it on the train tracks for us.  It shoudl have been simpler and much more fun.

I go back and forth on Bang. On the one hand, it's too long (especially for players who go out early), you can miss turns, etc. On the other hand, I played this a million times before I found The Resistance, and it's the closest feeling to that game IMO. Not sure who to trust, trying to deduce people's roles. I still think this is a good one, although it's also one I might not hold on to.

This is one of those games that I've played to death. It takes a game or two to learn the cards and the basic strategies involving each role, but once you do it's great fun. It's like Mafia on steroids involving secret roles and direct confrontation with other players , so it's a great party game, best with five to seven people.

Fun Factor: Secret roles, directly attacking your friends without knowing for certain whose team they're on

The only problem is getting people to move on to something else once you've introduced them to it...

The western theme is HUGE in this game. The hidden roles and random characters make each game exciting and different.

So, this is a great game if you stress theme and play quickly.

Just like many others, it's one of the game that introduce me to the whole board gaming world. It was fun during the time, however, I do feel like there is better game out there that have improved on the core mechanic and simply play better. 

The hidden identity mechanic seem to only matter on the first 1 or 2 turn. Afterward, it basically turn into a luck fest to see who draw better, and seriously, what is worst than getting kill before you even get a turn?

I think that a game like Bang! is best played with nongamers.  There is a lot of randomness in the card draws and the length of time the game takes is a little too long for the amount of gaming satisfaction provided.  However, with nongamers the system is quite different (the mafia-esque properties, though it is still pretty easy to figure out who's who) and the amount of luck and gametime aren't as bothersome.  It is unusually rules-heavy for such a light game, and it takes a while for new players to figure out the symbols used on the cards.  But it can be pretty fun as long as players don't mind direct confrontation.

This is probably the most played game of my weekly game group, as it handles up to 8 people. Also, it lets us play several games in an evening, and sometimes we just use it as a warm-up game, or that little extra game late in the evening, when the main event is over, and people start to leave...

A party game that doesn't quite work. The game slows down immensely because players are constantly forced to refer to the rules for special cards (the game is entirely symbol based).

Nice atmosphere to this game. It is quite chaotic and could last anything from 1 minute to over an hour. This variability is certainly a downside in my view. The different weapons don't have as much variety as I had expected. Some nice artwork on the cards and a little variety is injected by the identities. The identities seem incredibly imbalanced and the gameplay as a whole just has little strategy or choice.

[LUP 09-Oct-2006] Better than Werewolf in that you know who one player is.  Needs a rules issue so that everything is summarised.  It can occasionally run very long, but can take lots of players and it if it runs short or reasonable length is a fun game.

The crowd really determines how fun this game is, people who are into it and willing to play fast can make this game a blast.  But early eliminations and players who think about every card for lengthy periods before playing can make this game a drag.

Seems random. Played once and it wasn't that great. At least it was over quickly, since the (severely disadvantaged!) sheriff was killed off before his second turn. I'm not really into the theme of cowboys or shooting, though, so you can take my rating with a grain of salt.

We tried the 2 player game as described on the Da Vinci web sight.  I didn't know it was suppose to be for 4 players or I might not have bought it.  It was alright as the 2 player game.  It had a nice western theme, which I love.  It is kind of a basic role playing card game.  With the cards giving you special shooting abilities and other actions.  It wasn't bad and I will play it again if asked, but it isn't on my top ten list.  Maybe it is better with 4 players.

It's a cool idea; the problem is that it VERY quickly becomes clear who is one which team.  At that point, it devolves into a luck-of-the-draw situation, which is pretty boring.

Saboteur is a similar game that executes MUCH better, in my opinion.

RATING: 7
This is an overall fun game, and my inner teenage boy loves the innuendo of banging every other player repeatedly and without remorse. The player count is a drawback for my game situations - this game is most fun with more people, while I am often playing in groups of 3 or 4 (and it is a 4 player minimum). It is pretty easy to get to the table - the pun of being a literal Spaghetti Western, fun theme, and relatively straightforward rules make it appealing and easy to start. 

I'm not totally convinced by the part-cooperative/part-competitive playstyle. So far, games have either seemed like a case of everyone ganging up on the Sheriff, or a pointless free-for-all massacre, which, while thematically logical, don't make for a very fun game especially if you're on the losing end. This also tends to create unbalanced play; the vast majority of games we've played have ended with the Sheriff dying. However, this might be due to poor strategizing on the part of the players, since we usually play with fairly casual groups who don't get too deep into the strategy.

Bang is another deduction game but with some more interactive elements (shooting each other) that make it different. Each player gets a old west themed character that are all fun but sadly some are far-and-away better than others creating imbalance. Not recommended at all with less than 5 people but quite a bit of fun with more than five. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The good: Western theme. Players also must use deduction to figure out the various roles.

The Bad: The average game takes too long for what it is. On top of that, once in a while the game goes on for multiple hours. Players can be eliminated early on in a long game. The cards are fiddly - it takes multiple games to remember all the effects.

Juego de cachondeo para grupos grandes 5-7 personas. Muy incontrolable porque dependes mucho de las cartas que te toquen, pero que cumple su objetivo que es echarte unas buenas risas.

Lo malo la eliminaciÃƒÂ³n de jugadores que puede que arruinen la partida a mÃƒÂ¡s de uno (y si es su primera vez jugando puede que le fatienden el juego)

Just drips with theme, but you gotta have roleplayers (who get into character while playing) to really make this shine. Rules imbalances combined with player elimination (the latter almost dictated by the theme) do keep the rating at 7. It's best to play at parties with a large crowd (seven players or so), and let those knocked out early go get a drink and talk.

I'm still waiting for a good Bang! experience. I see a lot of potential in the game for me to enjoy it, but I think it needs the right crowd in the right mood.

Very fun - takes the foundation of a faster, more cuthroat and complicated version of "Werewolf" and piles on the western flavour like so much tasty, picante BBQ mesquite flavour.

Pretty wild game that can be quickly taught and quickly played. Great opener - gets the blood flowing without a lot of need for deep thinking. I unfortunately made a really bad rules misinterpretation about the "Jail" card which coloured my opinion of the game until I found out I had been doing it all wrong. Much better now.

Bang has become a true favourite amongst my friends. I really should charge commission considering the number of friends who have bought their own copy since playing at my place.

Fits into a pocket, a heap of people may play, and one is rarely not sober enough to pull of a somewhat reasonable play.

Yes, you may die before you've had a turn, yes, your team mates may sometimes be stupid. Who cares? The next game is 20 minutes away, and all may change.

Bang is a good game, one I warmly recommend; it captures a cinematic shootout well, and is loads of fun.

12-14-2007: I like one thing about Bang!  The theme of Spaghetti Westerns is dripping all over.  There are some clever mechanics, like the role selection, but ultimately, the player elimination and extremely high chaos factor (a player can be eliminated before getting a turn!) make it not my scene.  A good pub game -- would prob. get a 6 in that context.

2016 update: This is the context in which I most often play games, so BANG! now gets a 7.

Don't take the game too seriously and it will be fun.

You can't do much about your situation if players decide to gang up.  The secret identity aspect doesn't really work.  The outlaws MUST come out shooting if they want to win.

i love the different characters. Some are significantly stronger than others which is a problem, but it's a good game.  4 player is a bit boring b/c there's no reason for anyone to lie about their roles.. 5 gives the most intrigue I think and if the table gets too crowded then it's just a bit confusing for everyone and people are distracted

Apparently a 'beer & pretzel' game in reality a gem in which you have to choose carefully your allies.
Often the final round are really tense.

I've only played it twice, but it just wasn't any fun. I just sit there wishing for it to be over. I don't really feel as though you have a whole lot of control over the outcome of the game. There are games with a strong element of luck that succeed because there is a way of mitigating it in your favour. In Bang!, there's only 'running out of luck' when you get eliminated from the game. I highly doubt I'll be playing it again. [b]3.5[/b]

It's quick and fun, but it does result in players being eliminated.  Fortunately, it's usually short enough and friendly enough that it's not a big deal.  Our games have often been rather one-sided one way or another.  This probably means that our Renegades aren't doing a good enough job of balancing the other players.  There are also a few character cards that are obviously weaker than others.

Everyone talks about the promise of the roles, funny voices and all. In reality this ends up just being a card play game with players mostly silent.

They wanted to make the game multi-language, but some combinations of icons are really not clear. The  1 and -1 items are also confusing. I never know who can reach who. There is also this bug that you never seem to draw a bang card with are essential to play. It's like lands in magic. By the way, if you are the renegade, is it actually possible to win? The expansion with special items(green card) is not so bad.

If people are not taking this game lightly and are taking their time in completing their turns, this game becomes a huge drag and quite a boring affair.

The entire time I was played Bang! I was wishing I was playing [gameid=228]. The game is built around a hidden teams mechanic that is integrated much better in other games such as [gameid=37111]. The card play was nothing special either. Overall, everything this game does another game does twice as good. Keep moving along, nothing to see here.

Excellent use of theme in a game that can be fun with the right group but runs the risk of being a bit boring with the wrong group.  Decisions are a bit too obvious and the game is therefore a bit too light for my tastes.  It also can run a good deal too long.  Nevertheless, it can offer a diverting experience that is accessible to non-gamers.

I usually don't enjoy games that don't feature individual winners (and quantifiable scoring, as well). Bang can be fun - there's minimal downtime, even with 7, because the turns are so fast; but, until I played with the variant for individual scoring, the game was probably a 4/5.

RATING: 4
A light very luck-based card playing game. While the theme is cool and for a game of its genre such luck-based cards as the dynamite can be excused, the problem is the beginning of the game either diverges into 2 scenarios:
1. people take random potshots at each other, causing people to attack each other without knowing their allegience; the sheriff twiddles his thumbs  not really having an incentive to do anything.
2. The outlaws make their identity very clear by attacking the sheriff (yes the renegade can add a little bit of confusion, but the sheriff potentially wants to kill him/her eventually anyways). The deputies help out the sheriff, secret identities are effectively revealed.

It is very hard for the renegade to win this game (in fact, I've played a game where the renegade killed me as the sheriff in frustration prior to killing my deputy. This caused an awkward situation of the outlaws winning despite all of them being dead).

A downside is that you can get out of the game very early (I've been "shot" to "death" and/or riddled with Indian arrows on a couple occasions before I even got a turn).  Another downside (for some) is if the game takes an hour or more.  However, if the outlaws try to start making their move earlier on it usually makes the game faster.  I don't mind it either way.  I enjoy the role play and trying to figure out who is on whose teams, trying to make the opponent think I am am on their team while letting the Sheriff know (very subtly, but fairly) that I am on HIS team, and the normal interaction that can occur during this game.  Should not be a 'sit-and-think-and-never-talk-to-the-other-people-at-the-table type of game.

We started handing out three character cards at the beginning and we each get to select two from those three.  Dual-characters.  Yes.  "Slab-Willy-the-Kid" Combo?  Yes, please. :) Haven't looked back. 

 Great for witty people and more thoughtful (and patient) people.  Great for people who love the Old Western theme.  A chance to live out your dream of participating in an action packed Louis L'Amour story! 

Used to play this almost every day in college (18-24 year olds mostly).  Typically, most of us (of about 15-20 people) would prefer 6-7 players (sometimes more), but most would be up for a game with a minimum of 5.  You can mess around with 3 or 4 people, but...that is more for the 'diehards' and not an accurate reflection of the game in its purest form.

Hope this has been helpful to some.   Lock and load!!!

P.S. If anyone is in the NW Washington area and wants to play... Let me know!!!

I do fully acknowledge that the dice version is a "better" game. But Bang! will always be a favorite of mine. It's kind of the board game that got me back into gaming after college. I'd played it several time with my friends at Purdue, but it was when a local friend pulled out a copy that we started planning specific game nights.

Plus, there are always great jokes about banging and at least one person singing about how they didn't shoot the Deputy.

Also, I always draw Sheriff somehow, which is by far the best role to have.

I played a lot of Bang! when it first came out - probably too much and I burned out on it.  In small doses, it is fun: a good but recently simple card game with lots of interaction in the form of attacking, guessing people's motives and allegiances, bluffing and some tactical card play on top of that.  It has its flaws: players can be eliminated without getting to play, games can be very long or very short and the end game can sometimes drag.  But overall, it is entertaining.

A very GOOD game structure.  Fact pacing, fun twists, very playable.  Nothing about this game drags and unlike many games in this style, you *do* feel like you are in the situation.  Excellent
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A party Mafia-like game. Has weapons, items, characters. Eliminated players no longer take part in the game, which is a minus. The mechanics are not that well balanced either. It is still a fun party game for when you're bored with Avalon.

Good little filler game, bit of fun its a little crap with fewer people, its far too stacked agaist the sheriff, with the renegade acting more as a deputy than anything else... fun though
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mechanically sound, quick, thematic and fun. Probably infinitely replayable. Victory seems to depend a bit too much on turn order, though. 

I would have gotten more of a kick out of this if I hadn't already played BACCHUS' BANQUET, a game with a similar mechanic that's to my mind much funnier and more sociable.

With the right group, this game is terrific.  My only real complaints are: 1.) Hard to explain to non-gamers, but once they play it, one of the best "convert them" games and 2.) kind of illogical that the Sheriff doesn't know who his own deputies are

RATING: 9
This is a great game for parties or family get-togethers or what have you. There are some balance issues (there's always that one guy that gets to draw a million cards a turn and gets super lucky, dynamite and jail kinda suck) but this isn't for the hardcore gaming crowd, it's for like, parties and family get-togethers and what have you.

RATING: 3
This is a great idea for a game that just falls flat.  It's too long to be a filler.  The mystery identities are largely meaningless except for the renegade.  The elimination factor is bad given the length of the game--too long to wait, but too short to start another game.  Unless you are drinking more beer than your character in the game, I fail to see the entertainment value.

very fun, lighter version of family business. don't rely too much on bluffing because it's gonna be obvious very soon who's who. best played with 7 players (cos with 6 there's only one vice-sheriff, and he badly needs them!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
  The easiest game to get people to play.  Light and easy; it lacks for any real strategic play, but as a bridge for gamers and non-gamers nothing works better.  The wild west theme is done well and doesn't feel tacked on.  Also the limit on the number of times you can attack someone cuts down on the "take that!" factor.    If I didn't feel like it can drag on sometimes I would give it an eight.  Player elimination never helps also.

I see a lot of people rate this game down because of player elimination, not for me, I love the sense of danger, the head-to-head shooting and the begging for your life.
The mechanics favor the lucky, that is expected from a card game, but you can still get a win even with terrible luck if you have a good strategy.
The base game is more than enough to have tons of great games and lots of fun.

Very cool and funny, with a nice system for distance between players. More of a game than Werewolf (and playable with less players), but almost as much trashtalk, albeit with cheesier accents. The only drawback is that a player can get ousted pretty fast through no fault of his own, if the cards and the other players conspire against him.

However, it's possible that an player is eliminated quickly and have to wait and sometimes  it's a long time.

The game as an idea is perfect, but the game itself with just 80 cards and 15 characters  sucks.Me and my friends have bought every expansion except Gold Rush which we will buy really soon.With every expansion the game gets better and more interesting.If you want to buy it i suggest you buy it with all the expansions in the exact order  dodge city, valley of shadows, high noon+fistful of cards,wild west show and then decide if you really want to add purchases of cards where the game gets more complicated with the addition of gold rush.The difference with each expansion is visible.Dead players can come back to life with so many ways so the thrill stays the same with the addition of new brown and blue cards.For me 7 or 8 players is the best.We never play unless we have that number.The game has become so complicated and thrilling comparing to the original bang that so many things have to be taken in mind it makes this game awesome.I higly recommend it just not by itself.At least have dodge city with you.

4-7p, 30m.  The cards are really nice and sturdy with linen finish.
Only played a few times.  The first "two" were with 5 players--all new to this game (including me), and most not into games in general (except me :).  Rating may increase with more plays. First game was incredibly short due to the Sheriff getting slaughtered in a duel before we even made it once around the table.  THEN, the second game dragged on forever since I forgot the the 2nd-edition rule about the jail only lasting one turn max, so one of the outlaws spent most of the game in jail.  We all staggered away from the table in a daze, with one person muttering comments about "complex games."  I felt bad because there was so much laughter and lighthearted fun at first, but then it bogged down and became a drag.  My interest of course won't be fazed by one bad session like this since I am an enthusiast.  But I fear I soured the group.  My fault for not being more familiar with the rules.  But the game is a bit rules-heavy, and could use a good reference-sheet.
3rd play was with only 3 people, a situation in which the game is acknowledged not to shine.  This game is very social, and dependent on the group attitude.

I'm not entirely sure why, but my single play of Bang! turned me off instantly. I think it's the combination of randomness and a high screwage factor -- pretty much what kills Munchkin for me. It was painfully un-fun.

VERY fun game. played it a lot of times. HOWEVER, now I avoid it because of its flaws: possibility of early player elimination and possibility of very long game. when these two flaws happen together (which sometimes happen), it becomes a very awful experience for the players eliminated.

RATING: 5
There are things I really love (the basic idea overall being the biggest), but the rules are way overly complicated and that makes it a pain to teach anyone. Add to that the totally obtuse iconography and it is sort of a mess to play if you don't know it well. Given that there is a lot of bluffing and secret identities, not knowing the rules well seriously diminishes the quality. Further, the game is best with the full number, so teaching usually happens with at least someone and it just drags the game down. 

This game is an easy 7-8 with all experienced players but can drop considerably when bogged down with people who just aren't picking up the rules.

Bang is a great game with a striking balance, and interesting characters. One of the best social deduction games out there. Unfortunately the packaging isn't the best, and the game doesn't work as well with the lower bound of players.

Any time we have more than 5 or 6 people (too many for most other games) we bring out Bang!

[Edit] I've recently started to feel less inclined to play since one of the biggest drawbacks is that players who die early on have nothing to do for the rest of the game. A game like Saboteur might be a better choice for a large group of newbie gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simply put, Bang is a great filler game.  Games do not last insanely long and the action is fast paced.

The hidden player roles are what really make the game for me.  It takes a lot of strategy to successfully pull off being the deputy or the renegade well.  Putting off your primary target objective and masking your role early is vital to your victory.

My biggest complaint about the game is the sheer amount of randomness.  Characters, roles, and cards are based on the luck of the draw.  The best way that you can counter this is by trying to maximize the number of cards you draw.

Bang scales very well when playing with a larger group.  One thing I dislike the fact that it has a 4 player minimum in order to pull of the roles the game requires.  Since I do not have a regularly scheduled game night it takes a little bit of effort to put a game together.  As much as I do enjoy the game I do feel that the game's shortcomings do not make it worth putting together a game night where it is the headlining game.

Some people love it. [thread=1578825]I don't[/thread]. As a matter of fact, I would never recommend it. There are, though, plenty of characters with unique powers, and the use of card backs to track health is interesting. The deduction aspect is very poor. Too random and swingy. Relies too heavily on the luck of the draw. Very unballanced. Can drag for way more than it ever should.

Based on 1 play. Might improve once players know the cards and the game doesn't have to be stopped constantly. But one player was eliminated very quickly which doesn't bode well.

***update***

Second play and things only got worse. Two early player eliminations and then the game dragged because it seems like there's as many miss cards as bang cards.

This is a fun game, but can take a while to explain what all the different cards can do when you are teaching new players.

Played 17 times.
Last Played Mar 15, 2008

The first game we played with out the cards that required the rule book (as suggested by the rules).  It was an okay game, but then in the second game we added those cards in and boy was it so much more fun.  We had a lot of fun, and it went over with my friends even better than I had dared hope.

This game just keeps being more and more fun the more and more we play it.  It is quickly becoming a favorite among my friends.

We just played it for the first time with 4 players.  It seems that the fewer players you have the more the luck of the draw is a factor, with more players the luck is balanced out better to make for a more interesting game.

Last night we tried a new thing with the Character cards which I liked.  We dealt each player 2 cards.  They could then choose which of those two powers they wanted to use and use the other to track the life points.

The rules need some work.  Not the actual rules, just the way that they are written. It is a fun game and doesn't require a lot of playing space.  It scales very well.  The only problem I have is that players get eliminated.  This was not a problem when I played at my New Year's eve party, but may be a problem at dedicated game nights.

[Edit: I also think that the symbols don't help.  I know they are there so the game can be published easily in different languages, but when you have a symbol that means "consult the rule book for special rules," It sort of loses it's effectiveness.]

The secret roles do not work as well in this game as The Resistance. Games also vary wildly in time depending on card draws. Not my favorite party card game as I have found many others that do both party and cards much better. However, when just hanging out with my non-gamer friends, this one is just OK. I wouldn't leave the room if this is what they wanted to play... I might suggest something else though!

Dans le port, les bateaux de commerce attendent d'être remplis de marchandises. 
Chaque navire doit stocker une certaine combinaison de marchandises. 
Les joueurs prennent le rôle de commerçants essayant de remplir leurs entrepôts de marchandises qui sont alors à leur tour transférées aux bateaux présents dans le port. 
Ils doivent prêter attention à la bonne combinaison des marchandises parce que les capitaines acceptent seulement les marchandises d'un seul commerçant et s'attendent à une livraison complète avant que leurs bateaux partent du port. 
Il est également très important de trouver le bon moment pour charger les cargaisons dans les vaisseaux car la flotte quitte le port lorsque l’espace de stockage est plein et que les vents sont favorables. 
Les joueurs doivent donc toujours anticiper les vents pour pouvoir influencer les évènements.

This is a fun big-group game, somewhat similar to Werewolf. It's probably not my favorite, as I'd rather play Ca$h 'n Gun$, but I like bringing it out with the right group of people.  The hidden roles are fun along with the mind games that get played throughout.  However, in my experience, it's not always been as fun for everyone involved.  The Sheriff in particular seems to get beat up a little too much.  Regardless, it still seems to result in a lot of entertainment, and it's definitely one that I need to get to the table more often.

This is an odd beast.

I have a good time pretty much every time I play.  And yet...

From the first time I played it I was never convinced it actually made sense as a game.  It seems to take far too long to explain to new players for a social game; it is too easy for a new player to misunderstand the strategy and mess up the role-guessing aspect (say by shooting the sheriff as a deputy in order not to give himself away); it is quite possible for a player to be killed before he has a chance to take any real part in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Used to really like it, but the hidden roles aren't all that interesting.  If you are an outlaw you really might as well just get on with shooting the sheriff, otherwise he'll just sit there and drink beer and collect miss cards.  Once you shoot him, everyone else will shoot you.

Still, it is a very thematic game and can be great fun with the right group.

I really like Bang and so do most of the people I get to play.  Its a faster paced game than some and easy to carry the deck of cards for travel.

First modern game I tried, almost by accident because of an acquaintance. The only flaw is the player elimination, but it is also a fun spectator game so I usually don't mind. It's got hidden roles, but the roles become easy to guess in a few rounds so it isn't frustrating like the full social deduction games. I love it for the take-that card play.

Enjoyable beer-and-pretzels large-party game.  Geek-neutral theme (unlike Citadels) means you can usually entice non-gamers into it.  Relatively quick to explain, and the idea goes down okay.  Player elimination is meh... but it's a party game or gamers' filler, so that's okay.

Good no-brainer fun. While I didn't find many tactics going on here with my first plays, the theme gives lots of kudos to this one. The cards of excellent quality have great illustrations, and captures the atmosphere. Lots of laughs, specially with 5 players (the best option, IMO). Convincing the sheriff to shoot the deputy is priceless.

There's very little skill involved, it's possible to be knocked out of the game before you've even played a turn, and the roles aren't very well balanced. But despite all that the theme really shines through and I almost always have a good time with it.

Recommended house rule: take the beer cards out the game after one use to stop the game dragging on too long.

RATING: 3
I really can't stand this game.  Somebody brought it in to work and we played it for about a week.  I just recently got stuck playing it at a game night at a local store.

Bang is set in the wild west, with sheriffs, deputies, outlaws, and renegades.  Each player gets two characters and chooses the one they think has the best special ability.  Then each player is dealt a role.  There will be one renegade and one sheriff, then the other players will either be outlaws or deputies.  At this point the sheriff reveals their card so everybody knows who the sheriff is, but nobody else reveals who they are.

The win condition is different for the different roles.  The sheriff and deputies win if the sheriff survives, so they are trying to kill off the renegade and the outlaws.  The outlaws just need to kill the sheriff to win.  The renegade wants to become sheriff, so this role helps everybody out at some point.  The renegade needs to kill everybody off except for the sheriff, so it comes down to a duel, then if the renegade can kill the sheriff the renegade wins.

I thought of not knowing who anybody is was kind of cool at first.  However, not having a good way to figure out who's on your team really killed this game for me.

To start out you only have a gun that has a range of one, so you can shoot the person to your left and to your right.  You can add a better gun to give you better range, get a horse to put yourself out of other peoples' range, and there are other various cards for shooting people, taking cards, making somebody miss you, beer to get health back, etc.

I give this game a 3 because it is too hard to know who is on your team.  When you do figure it out, everybody knows it, so you then have no protection.  If you start shooting at the sheriff, then the deputies are going to shoot you, then the outlaws will target the deputies, and so on.  It is a big secret until the shooting begins, then it just depends on who gets the right cards and where you are sitting.  There is just too much randomness in this game for me.

I loved this one when it first came out, but after a few plays I began seeing its limitations. Basically some players can be eliminated without being able to even play their first round, and sometimes it takes too long. Anyway, it is still a good game.

Best w/7, 5-7:

Relatively quick game of hidden roles and player elimination.  Best with 5 and 6 players; any fewer and there are too few roles at the table, any more and the time between turns gets excessive.  Gameplay is luck of the draw dependent.  Good for a quick warm up or light filler.

[played 5+ times]

easy game and quite fun. Different roles doesn't have the same possibility to win (it's quite impossible in 6-7 to win as renegade), but if you don't mind you can already have fun.
It's a bit long in 6-7 players: a few games can become endless, with player waiting for the last player to die; au contraire a couple of games I played ended before the first round was completed.
I think it's better in 5 or 7 than 6: in 6 sheriff side is too weak.
Like other elimination games, who first goes out have to find something to do while waiting others finishing the game... and sometimes it can take long!

Not a bad game at all, but there are a lot of symbols on the cards that you need to know in order to play the game. This is a problem for a game that is light and hasa lot of random ness in the card draw. It sometimes takes way too long for and since there is player elemination that is not fun at all. The dice game version of bang solves these problems and is a better game overall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This card game is a fast paced game where players take hidden roles and try to kill their opponents. Chosen characters give players special abilities and a plethora of equipment, weapon and other cards add some spice and twist to the game play. The turn sequence is pretty simple; on your turn, play as many cards as you want with the exception of the Bang! cards. There is some complication with how certain cards work that first time players will need to wrap their heads around. It also doesn’t help much that the cards all have symbols on them rather than the description of what it does on the cards so expect to have the rulebook handy for MANY consultations. However, once everyone gets a good grasp and feel, which can be expected after a couple of games, then this game really shines! Beware, this game is all about conflict and trying to eliminate the other players so if that’s not your cup of tea, you may want to move on. Also, there’s lots of player interaction, as you can imagine. Add lots of negotiation and backstabbing and this game becomes a real riot!

Always a favorite with my group this is one that is in constant rotation and gets lots of play. The only real downside is player elimination, which can be a drag since some games can last a long time and players killed early can potentially find themselves sitting around. Other than that, I highly recommend this game! Great fun!

Bang! is another in the genre of Mafia-style games, augmented with cards providing the players with various abilities. The players assume the roles of the Sheriff, some Deputies, Outlaws, and a Renegade, but only the Sheriff’s identity is known to the public. The Sheriff and Deputies must kill the Outlaws & Renegade to win, the Outlaws must kill the lawmen to win, and the Renegade only wins as the last man standing.

Players play “Bang!” cards to shoot at each other, augmenting their shots with other cards to give them further range with a rifle, for instance, or to dodge behind a barrel card for cover, or various other effects. In addition, each player is assigned a character, each with a unique ability. The game plays nicely and swiftly and is fun for a larger group.

Also, rules/cards are written terribly, makes it hard to understand easy concepts. Never really want to play again.

I love the theme and gameplay of this game, but have a couple issues with it. Mostly, I cant' decide what good strategies should be. For example, in one game I instantly declared that I was a deputy and would support the sheriff.  True, I could be lying, but I wonder about how games would go if the deputies immediately spoke up... does it require that all players then instantly lie and pretend to be deputies also, for the game to still allow them to win?   I can''t quite figure out how information should be revealed, or who you should start firing at, and that I can't conceive of a good strategy somewhat consternates me. :)

RATING: 2
A fundamentally unbalanced game in which player caprice or a single imperfect move can easily ruin 40 minutes of your life. Bang's crowning flaw is its tendency to exile one or two players from the game 15 or 20 minutes before the game itself ends, an unforgivable waste of time when all that player wants to do is have fun. Like Monopoly in its dull pointless grind, but mercifully shorter.

RATING: 6
Great game with large groups of people.  Nice and hectic, with some strategy.  Unfortunately, there are two big problems with the game.

1) You need at least 5 players for it to be fun
2) Many people just think way too long on their turn when it SHOULD take less than 1.5 minutes to:
--- Draw two cards
--- Play all cards that give you more cards
--- Play all blue card which help
--- Drink any beer
--- Hurt everyone that you can and should
--- Discard

There was a time I really enjoyed Bang!  But after three dozen plays I just don't want to play it any more.  It's repetitive, the hidden roles get revealed quickly, and sometimes games go on way too long.

Shadow Hunters has nearly the exact same feel but improves on every one of those aspects.

This is a game has to potential to be one that I just hate, but for now I'll give it a decent rating.  My first play of it was fun, if silly.

Először egy kocsmában játszottam, ez mindent elmond a játékról. Nagyjából ennyit is tud, bár hozzá teszem, nem is akar ennél több lenni. Egy célja van: a szórakoztatás. Ami miatt kevesebb pontot kap, mint a többi szerepjátékos partijátékom, az, hogy ki lehet esni, ez pedig rombolja a játékélményt a kiesőnek. A vadnyugati téma és a hangulat plusz pont!

What's good about Bang? Party game for up to 7 players, handy when there's too many people to play good games!

The bad? You can knock out a player or two in the first two rounds, possibly before they've actually had a turn themselves! They then must sit out for what can be anywhere up to an hour or more. The instruction book and cards are also a comical mess of poor translation. Many questions will have to be guessed at to play.

The ugly? Their's no strategy whatsoever. You got a Bang? shoot the sheriff! You run out of cards? Tough you are going to die as everyone will shoot you. Then when you get down to two players its essentially down to who draws a bang and doesn't draw a miss that decides the outcome, usually the person with the most life.

For the same length of time you could play any number of much better filler games, or Cash & Guns, which has a similar theme but is much better in just about every way.

Incredibly overrated for what it is.

I enjoyed Bang!   I just wanted to keep playing.  I would say that this is a really good game, except that when you're the first to die - there's a fair bit of downtime waiting for the game to start again.  It's probably a great game to have at gaming events - so that when you die you can move on to a different game.  If you had TV or something on in the background to watch when you die, I might consider it an '9'.  Have just ordered the expasion.

RATING: 7
Own both the analog version and the IOS version. I think Bang is fun but is best if played quickly, the players enjoy bluffing and mindgaming (eg "I'M not the renegade, HE is"), and the players can laugh about being eliminated by dynamite blowing up in their face. Bang rules are a bit more complicated than the average filler so it might not appeal to casual gamers. Its best with 5 players only, too, which reduces its suitability. Endgame can also drag on long after the outlaws are eliminated and its down to the deputy duking it out with the renegade with the sheriff waiting patiently to see the final identity of the second to last person standing.

-Cowboys?...

[b]Dislike:[/b]
-The game plays you, there are no decisions to be made aside from who to shoot
-Downtime

Too bad... I was interested to try this, but met with disappointment.

Player elimination, no thinking about what card to play... this is basically Uno with more rules, longer downtime and a theme slapped on.

It's too bad you need to draw 2 cards every turn (and possibly more with certain cards) cause that just leads to more downtime for all the other players.

I want to say the miss card is stupid because it just is like "I shoot you" "no you don't", but I guess that's the point this game is going for. It's just that it works better in games with a faster pace.

Okay, so the game is definitely not in the cards; it's too obvious what you need to play. So perhaps the game lies within the roles like in a game of Werewolf... the game of who to shoot.

Well, I haven't really played the game that way with lying and deduction, because the only time I was able to finish a game of this I was right next to the Sheriff and I was an Outlaw, so there was no point in shooting the unrevealed guy since that might as well be another Outlaw.

So considering that (and this is just a theory since I've only had that one experience), once everyone has gone, don't you pretty much know who to shoot? If you're a Deputy and the people next to the Sheriff shot him, you shoot them, and if none of them did your best bet is shooting all the others. If you're an Outlaw, shoot the Sheriff and if you can't hit him, shoot those who don't shoot the Sheriff or those who shoot the people who shot those that shot the Sheriff. So even deciding who to shoot isn't really a decision.

In most other hidden role games, there usually are no turn structures so everyone is involved at the same time, no waiting for your turn whatsoever. Also, you can at least say you were trying to bust other people but in this game it is just way too risky to shoot the Sheriff for that reason.

As a card game, Uno is better because it's much simpler. As a hidden role game, pretty much anything is better.

Dice game is better cause at least there you have risk management with the dynamite results.

This is the game that got me started. Not a whole lot of strategy, but a lot of fun (as long as you're not Willie the Kid, an outlaw with a handful of Bang! cards and you're sitting next to the Sheriff, who happens to be your wife. She hasn't played the game since).

Bang! is usually light and fun, and there's some strategy to be had, although the hidden roles perhaps leave some room for improvement.  It can sometimes drag on, but I've never had it overstay its welcome in the way that Zombies!!! or Munchkin do.

I like this game. It has a nice western theme and is simple to teach. I don't get to play much, because it's hard to find enough people to play.  

The downside to this game is that once someone is knocked out, they have to sit there twiddling their thumbs until it's over.

I like the hidden role mechanic, which makes you curb your shots at the beginning.

I will start this comment by saying that this game would be a 10 in my opinion if every game went well.  What I mean by that is that the right people get the right cards at the right time and they play them the right way.  When this happens, even when people are out of the game, it is still a blast to cheer on the rest of the people that are playing.

However, probably every 3rd time or so, you games that literally game end within 1 round, which is no fun at all. Those would be the dud games.

Overall, I would say that this game is a blast to play and every time that we have 6 or 7 people over to play games, this is the one that I want to play.  However, you should try to play at least a couple of games because one of those games might end up being a dud.

There are many good ways about hidden identities but Bang! is not one of them. The sheriff and the deputies want to kill the outlaws and vice versa but since the outlaws gain nothing by not shooting the sheriff, the identities get revealed quickly and the game reduced to drawing cards and shooting at the other side until one of them eventually wins.

One of the character powers is a mandatory effect based on hidden information. 'nuff said.

OK, OK, full opinion. Since there's no way to determine roles, the beginning of the game is just random shooting until someone decides to antagonise the sheriff. Then the rest is mostly a lesson in imbalance, showing a poor understanding of the concepts of tempo and card advantage CCG players are familiar with; especially when you pair a defensive character with the sheriff role. Unfortunately this means that what would only be a flawed and mindless "take that" game can in many instances drag for what seems to be an eternity.

I LOVE this game for its intended purpose as a party game. It is incredibly easy to teach and even non-gamers greatly enjoy it. It hits the table frequently when we have enough players, often playing it several times in a row. There are lots of great characters to choose from and the roles are splendid. The more people the more fun this game is. Easy to set-up and has high replayability. The roles may be a bit unbalanced at a 4 player game, but that's part of why it is best with more players. Fantastic party game for everyone. However, I would love to see Harry Potter version of this.

On the surface, Bang! has a lot of qualities that could make it a worse game than it is.  It can be a fairly long game, and there is player elimination.  In fact, it is possible for a player to be eliminated before taking a turn.  Some characters are also less fun (and less powerful) than others.  As a result, Bang! can occasionally have really bad sessions that just don't work.

However, the theme and the player interaction really pull through for this one.  Most of the time its a very engaging, fun game with some great mechanics.  The hidden roles add a great deal, and the variable player powers add depth and replayability.  This is by far the most inconsistent game I own, but it is fun and supports a large group, which means it sees the table a lot.

My opinion of Bang! has suffered through overplaying, and for seemingly being the only person at the table who can look at the reference card to figure out what the symbols mean.  I always seem to have to talk through the entire game, even with people who have played before.

Fun diversion for the party crowd. Its really nothing more than a good filler, with hidden roles tacked on top of it. Can be slow and cumbersome with too much of a crowd.

Really too much hype for a game that has been outclassed by way better fillers and party games.

Players are either the sheriff, deputy, outlaw or renegade. Only the sheriff is known at first. Play cards to shoot at other people, gain special abilities, heal, hide, get better weapons, etc. Fun, light, would get higher rating if it wasn't the player elimination aspect of it. But still fun to gun down your opponents.

Cute, wasn&#039;t as outstanding as expected and wouldn&#039;t neccessarily appeal to everyone.  Game play is quick, and flavored by what character and role you get.  Cards are great quality.  OK, but not outstanding, for the Werewolf/Mafia set who want a little different game.

I always enjoy a game of Bang! if I'm playing with the right amount and type of people

The player elimination is a bit too fierce in this game. For example, I have seen someone eliminated before their first turn in larger games.

If the players suffer from AP this game can bog down quickly. Also, if people are too timid to start shooting this can have a really slow start to it as everyone loads quietly loads up on cards.

Perfect way to follow up a Western.  Made even better with Dodge City and the expansion cards.  A very fun game with player elimination though, but hey house rules are always there.  It's always guaranteed to produce raucous laughter among non-gamers and veteran gamers alike...

UPDATE:  The unfairness of being the renegade is bothering me quite a bit.  If you end up being it, then you're pretty much screwed.  Also, there's no much incentive to stay hidden for a long time since you don't want to waste the opportunity to play a Bang! against the person you want to kill.  Another thing is that with many players, it's quite possible by the time your turn arrives that you're in pretty bad condition and you were not able to do anything.  Player elimination is yet another problem as games might go for a while after that.  All in all, I'm liking Bang less and less...

RATING: 7
Bang! is a very accessible game for large groups (7) where each player has a role (Sheriff, Deputy, Outlaw, or Renegade) that is kept secret. They are trying to complete the goal of their role without getting killed by the other players in the game.  The Sheriff is exposed, while the other players are secret, which means you may accidentally kill one of your teammates without intending to.  I'm usually up for this game, but the player elimination element can be tough as it leaves folks watching a game that can sometimes drag on a bit too long.

Pros: Party game (7 players!), theme, theme, theme, trash talking welcome and allowed, just plain fun.  Cons: No real strategy, quirky cards/rules.

Either you're an outlaw stuck between the sheriff and the deputy so you die very quickly or the sheriff is stuck between 2 outlaws so the game's over in a minute or you're an outlaw stuck between your pairs and you can't do shit or maybe you're the renegade waiting for someone else to win. A hidden role game where roles stay hidden for about 2 turns.

RATING: 5
A hidden role game where players get dealt secret cards telling them if they are a Sheriff, Deputy, Outlaw, or Renegade.  The Sheriff is the only identity that is known by the group.  Everyone takes turns 'banging' other players and by their actions people can start determining who is what role until the climax of the game where there is only one group left.

I find that with hidden role games a new player can really ruin the game if they are not a good actor or do not know the basics of how the game works.  This is one of the more simple hidden role games that usually is a hit with non-gamer friends.  There does seem to be a lot of downtime in-between player turns and if you get killed in the beginning you are eliminated with nothing to do for awhile, however, even with these drawbacks it is still a pretty enjoyable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The rule make seance once half way though the first game. Otherwise they are hard to read to a new group. The symbols are not that clear for a new player. And some of the rule option feel they were thought while playing so are easy to understand when your underway. For a table of 6 I think removing most of the big weapons would be good.

Recomendado para muchos jugadores, pero tiene la pega de que cuando mueren no tienen nada que hacer hasta el final de la partida (hay una variante con fantasmas para eso), y puede alargarse bastante.

 It was great when I had new people that I was trying to get into gaming, but now that I have a solid group of gamers to play with, the desire to bring this one out has dropped. Mostly because you never know how long the game will take. Could be 15 minutes, but it could be an hour and 15 minutes.

For me, the prototypical novelty game. One of my first gateways into the modern genre. Only the first few minutes of the game are fun--i.e.,when you find out what your role and identity are. It's all downhill from there, as the game can be interminable and replays poorly. But I remember liking it so much when I had only Chutes and Ladders/Life/Trouble to compare it to.

Over-the-table this hidden-role game is a bit of a snoozefest as people repeatedly look up icons and try to remember what every card does. It should be quick and easy like Shadow Hunters, but with newer players it doesn't get near to its vision.

Has a lot of good points: it scales well for large numbers of players, and the hidden roles add a nice element of bluffing to a somewhat random game.  But Bang also has some significant bad elements: player elimination, often before a player gets a turn; long downtime, with nothing to do on other players' turns; too much luck ("I didn't draw a miss or a beer, so I'm dead"); too little basis for making decisions in the early game ("you're weak, so I'll shoot at you").

I don't see this as a "party" or "family" game -- I don't like games where it's possible to eliminate people and leave them with nothing to do while waiting for it to end.

RATING: 7
Avvincente e semplice party game, è uno dei più famosi giochi di un autore italiano. La fortuna è ben bilanciata da un po' di strategia e un po' di bluff, bluf che di solito dura giusto la parte iniziale delle sfide. La principale negatività è che è facile uscire prematuramente dal gioco, a volte anche dopo pochissimo, rimanendo spettatori per il resto del gioco. La durata delle partite è imprecisata, a volte quasi interminabili rendendo il tutto frustrante per gli eliminati. Per il resto il gioco è simpatico e piacevole. Spesso vien voglia di rigiocarlo più volte di fila.

Bang! is not a serious game in any way, pretty light on strategy and good for social interaction.

RATING: 6
What an amazing 4-player game I had! Played it with my gf and her brother and gf. Even though this type of cruel elimination should not be enjoyed by couple groups, I am willing to give it a 9 just based on its gameplay and amount of laughter and fun it brought to the table. I would reckon my rating would go up when I play with my rowdy bunch of guy friends and wih the optimum no. of players ie 5,6,7 players.
**Update** A little bit too drawn out at times and with player elimination, becomes a little unfun. Yet to play with my guy friends though, shall wait till then before giving final verdict.
**Update** Guy friends loved it. Though player elimination and high downtime still plagued the game. Will stick to the current rating for now.

It seems to me that there aren't actually that many choices or strategies for this game. That would be alright if it weren't for the fact that it can drag on for so long. There is also the distinct possibility of early elimination. Would rather play cash and guns.

Oh my gosh! This game is a lot of fun.  It is my ds's favourite.  I can't wait to play with more than 4 people. Update: we played with 7 over Christmas.  It was really fun.  Although a newbie got to be Sherrif and felt a little overwhelmed.  Next time, I think, we will give an experienced player the Sherrif.  Sadly, my main game group doesn't really care for this game.  So I don't get to play it too much.

RATING: 7.5
A great game to put a large group of people in a game playing mindset. It combines the role elements of Werewolves or Mafia and the card hand strategy of games like Mille Bornes.

The only problems with this game are the unpredictable game length (can vary from 15 minutes to well over 1h in my experience) and the fact that players can be eliminated right off the start. These balancing issues can be frustrating: be sure to keep a backup game nearby (at least a playing card game) for the eliminated players to play.

RATING: 4
I have the german version of this, but I can't read german!Update- have played two games (7 player)including Dodge city. The gameplay was tedious and slow because we kept having to look up rules that should have been printed on cards, and the strategies were annoyingly shallow.I expect this would change if we to play it more, but I can't see this happening.

I don't like mechanics which encourage players to stomp on players who are already doing badly i.e. if someone has been shot at a lot, the rational thing to do is shoot at them as their hand of cards is now smaller.

Dynamite was random and didn't add much to the game- even from a thematic viewpoint as it didn't make sense- it just prety much kills off a randomly chosen player  (or they will die soon after).

Bought Dec 2006, sold to Coton Autumn 2007?

Fighting the Sheriff, one on one, at the end was like fighting the Borg! Every good card was picked from hands before I can use it. No way to overcome that type of an advantage.  Special dueling rules should be allowed at the end in this case, no?

When I first play Bang! I didn't care much for it.  Thought it was pretty boring, and very underwhelmed.  However, after the reading the buzz it has generated, I picked one up on the cheap at Wizard's G-O-B sale. Got a game together with some newbies and gave it a try.  We had a rollicking good time.  I enjoy the interaction between players, and there is a bit of strategy there too.  Plus I am a sucker for Western-themed games.

RATING: 5
It's an advanced Family Business, but adds a reason to pick on people (good) and increases the number of different cards (bad) that newbies will always be asking clarifications on. Like Citadels, it's kind of aimed at a crowd of 7 (what we played with), but the downtime is similarly horrendous. I had lots of fun with the theme and the outcomes, but it didn't make up for the lack of interesting decisions on a turn or the dead time. Or for people wondering what to do if they found Boot Hill early.

What I liked:
- Kind of goofy fun, up to 7 players

What I didn't like:
- 75 minutes is WAY too long for this kind of game
- I don't like bluffing/deception/traitor games in general
- The first couple rounds can be dull, if nobody wants to tip their hand.
- Certain setups can be very unbalanced
- Player elimination

I would put the weight around 1.8.

One of the best non-traditional card games ever! Very fun theme that has been brilliantly adapted to the gameplay. Great visual design and the best card quality you can get. Due to the "hide 'n' seek" plus "backstabbing" plus team-play game mechanics this is one of the games in my collection with highest replayability, it's at its best with 5+ players.

- Rules are well structured and the game is explained easily, will appeal to virtually anyone who enjoys 15mins of great fun!

The base game is pretty fun.  Icons are all you've got to work with to figure out what cards do.  This becomes problematic when you get to expansions which just aren't executed very well.  As a player elimination game and a game with one player who can rarely win, it can end up frustrating some players more than the fun they are getting from the game.

I've played many times as a filler game on many a game night.  There's nothing wrong with this game and its sort of fun.

For this reason my rating is perhaps a little lower than the game deserves on its own merits.

April 08- played with Ken. Best experience yet. I was outlaw & I had it down to me, the sheriff and the deputy. Then they capped my ass.

Last play was with High Noon- I think this really added good flavor and rethink to the game.

This is a good game with people that are all familiar with it and are just into the experience. Kinda of like Killer Bunnies in that regard.

Un gioco dove lo sceriffo è circondato da un gruppo di conoscenti che a parole sono tutti fedelissimi vice. Le regole sono semplicissime, ma il vero spettacolo sono i giocatori. Un punto in più perché rende meno penosa l'attesa dei soliti ritardatari, venuti a giocare a qualcos'altro. Un altro punto in più perché il divertimento è proporzionale alla qualità dei giocatori (e quelli con cui gioco sono straordinari!).

Most people complain about the player elimination but that is far down my list of complaints. Social deduction where the roles are obvious early on except for occasionally the renegade.

Most of the plays are obvious. Too long for how light and mindless it is. Games like that aren't by their nature bad but this one lacks any tension or...fun.

Has been completely and justifiably replaced by the dice version.

I really don't care for this game. It is too random and at times completely unfair. Being elimiated early really sucks. I hate not knowing who are my enemies and who are my allies. And I really like Werewolf too. This is not like Werewolf because everyone knows who the sheriff is at the start of the game and there is no time set aside for discussion. Then the only way to kill someone is the random cards. Sometimes the sheriff is nearly impossible to kill depending on which character special ability he has. Your ability to target players with shot cards is based on how close they are around the table from you and what gun and horse cards players have. This sometimes causes the outcome to be determined by who is directly on the two sides of the sheriff. If they are both outlaws, sheriff dies. If they are deputies, good luck outlaws. If you are the renagade, you pretty much lose no matter what. This game just sucks. There are a lot of other little card games that are much better. If you want a western theme, try Boomtown. Better game with less random stupidness.

It's one of the games which brought me back into gaming.  I love being able to shoot down your friends-western style.  The fun factor is very high, however most games it's pretty easy to know who has which role and falls into a formula.  It generally gets somewhat repetitive.  The rules can be difficult to explain to newbies and the cheat guides for the players should be better explained.

I prefer Shadow Hunters over Bang now.

This one was tough to learn. The instructions were confusing. It took us one round just to learn how to play, but the second round went better. I'd like to play it again, but the right opportunity hasn't come along. You really need a table where you are all sitting around it in a circle/square/rectangle, so you can tell how far apart each player is. You also need enough players who are all up for a slightly complicated game. UPDATE: we started playing this at work, and it was a big hit with my coworkers. We play at least a couple of times per month now.

My opinion of Bang was originally that it was seriously unbalanced and difficult, if not impossible, for the Renegade to win.  However, that was based on only player it with a large group.  After playing with a smaller group of 5 players, I found the balance to be a lot better, and the game in general to be a lot more fun.  My rating for this game rose because of this discovery.  Games that support large groups are scarce, and it's good to have them, but in the case of Bang, I'd recommend it as a 5-player game at best.

[i]"I'll [b]BANG[/b] ye!"[/i]

I can see why this is so liked by players all round the world. It's fun and oozing with thematic role playing. It's simple and easy and can be taught in five minutes. Still, there was something missing (even though I really liked the game). These kinds of games should be reaaly short, like [b]Adios Amigos[/b], but I fear there's a risk that Bang! could go on forever. Also, some of the characters are really unbalanced. Sure, everything doesn't have to be equal and that's also something that comes from the RPG-department, but some are [i]REALLY[/i] [b]REALLY[/b] unbalanced.

This is a western themed card game. most players are outlaws, one is a renegade, one deputy and a sheriff. No one knows who  is who. shot it out. The outlaws want the sheriff dead, the sheriff wants the outlaws dead, and I think the renegade just wants to be Clint Eastwood :)

4-7 Players

Cute spaghetti Western style card game. Players are taking aim at each other and trying to kill outlaws or the sheriff, depending on the role card they played. More fun with lots of players, I suspect.

RATING: 6
(10+ plays)  There have been a couple of editions of this game, the latter ones being more playable.  Once you get some players willing to step through and learn the game, it's a fun fast shoot out.  But getting to that point is a challenge.  The symbology is just obtuse, and the range rules are counter intuitive.  If you can get 5 Wild West fans with some patience, you would get a lot of mileage out if this game.

An almost great game.

Entretenido y logrado juego de cartas del salvaje oeste, apto para muchos jugadores (creo que 7 ú 8). Sólo tiene una pega, para mí, gordísima: cuando se elimina un jugador los demás siguen jugando hasta que termina la partida, y así con el resto de jugadores que se van eliminando. Esto te quita las ganas de volver a jugar.

RATING: 5
A long series of obvious choices, the game is decided by luck of the draw giving one side the upper hand.  Losing players have to sit by and watch for quite a while.  It's not broken, and I like some of the card theming, but even playing with the High Noon expansion didn't really help this game.

RATING: 6
My enthusiasm has begun to wane a bit on this one, mostly due to the fact that I get tired of carrying the one or two people who forget the rules every time we pull it out (and we've played about 20 times).  With a big group of fellow enthusiasts, this card game has almost no rivals.

A nice collection of Bang and some of its expansions. The bullet case is kinda neat. Bang is really more of a party style card game, for larger groups. But it's pretty easy to learn, so it can be a gateway game. The game can drag, and players can get eliminated (which can suck for some of the players out early).

I think that I will like this game more with additional plays. However, there are just too many details to learn on first play; hence, my low rating. However, I expect this to go higher upon subsequent plays. I wish that there was a stripped down version (with limited set of action cards, or special character powers) that might make it easier for first time players.

RATING: 5
Can be lots of fun with lots of people.  I look at this game as a good, easy time filler.  We usually use it between games or waiting for the always late guy.  The Sheriff has a hard time of it with our bunch of thugs.  It can be very one sided and downtime can be long if you sit by the holder of a 'Volcanic' and lots of BANG cards!  Don't be surprised if you're dead and out of the game BEFORE you ever get to do anything.

This game falls under the category of Carcassonne for me: a game everyone else seems to like but I feel is completely "blah".  The gameplay is rather rote, to me, and the first couple rounds you spend discovering who is who doesn't have the same magic for me that it apparently does with everyone else.  For me, it seems to degenerate quickly from "I have no idea what to do" to "on my turn I am decidedly gonna try to shoot that guy".  No real decisions to be made and no fun besides what you may invest in it.  The beloved western theme is simply not enough to save this game for me.  (If it was, with seven people I would just as soon fire up Blazing Saddles on DVD.) Finally, the game is way too hard to explain quickly to newcomers/newbies to be a party game and too light to really call anything else.

This is a fun game, especially with a group of people who will role-play a bit.  The rules can be a little difficult to explain to new players.  Sometimes it seems like the hidden roles aren't very hidden, because there's often actions that must be taken clearly define who the players are.  Our game group hasn't quite figured this one out yet -- sherrifs win far too often in our group.

Definitely enjoyable. The instruction booklet is very helpful for first-time players. I enjoy playing with adults and my kids, though it was a bit awkward to explain to my kids on the first play that a beer card could save their lives, not to mention playing a game where the object is to shoot your fellow players is a bit family-unfriendly. I don't care. It's fun to play.

Super simple, but a good party game.  Hidden roles are akin to Clans; players take actions that benefit themselves, but sometimes need to help the other team just to keep the heat off themselves.  Lots of Wild West theme, which strangely seems even better with the Italian and English words on each card.  This language independence comes at the cost of symbols instead of words, something you'll have to get used to if you want to play the game.  Easy symbols, but can scare some people away.

RATING: 6
I had reservations getting this game, as it is mainly elimination to win, which for me is socially not a good game condition, so long as the ousted players aren't waiting too long for the next game. However, the hidden objectives and the fun the game seems to have generated overruled my concerns about elimination. Because all roles but the sheriff are secret, table talk becomes lively to determine who's who, which is a fun element. Being the sheriff also means suffering paranoia which is an interesting game situation. Alas, I should have trusted my instincts, despite the game play being interesting and fun. Now, not only is elimination an issue, but also downtime due to drawing and then playing of cards. Symbols on the card involves cross referencing(but once you get to know them play will speed up). (Also I'm finding, like the victims, with 4 players the game falls flat; you need at least 5 to introduce a deputy). I'm now considering a variant to speed up play: on your turn you either play or draw, but only draw if you have equal or less cards than life points. The other consideration is to introduce the special cards straight away as they may speed up the rate of elimination. I'm hoping these changes will salvage the game from the sale pile as I appreciate the theme and design.

Végre hozzám is eljutott ez a játék, amiről már annyi embertől hallottam ilyen-olyan kritikát. (inkább olyat, ami mellette szólt)
Kieg nélkül játszottunk az alapjátékkal. 
Hááááát. Nem volt rossz, azt nem állítom, de egy kicsit túl van értékelve. Van benne több hiba, mint pl. hogy aki kiesik az elején, az malmozhat addig, amíg véget nem ér a játék, illetve az, hogy azután, hogy kiderül hogy ki kicsoda, már nincs annyi izgalom.
Ráadásul szerintem taktikázni sem lehet benne, pláne ha már a teljes életerőn vagy.
De hogy jót is írjak róla, igazi partyjáték, jókat lehet nevetni közben.

I didn't enjoy this, it way overstayed its welcome.  I thought that might have been my fault, since in my one game I was the sheriff and I'm probably the last person you want to be sheriff, but I've since been at another event where a large group played it (I sat out), thinking it would take 20 minutes, and it took about an hour and forty-five minutes.

A good card game, especially with lots of people, with a great theme. However, like an actual shootout it's more chaotic than strategic. Luck of the draw can be more important than what cards you play, and you often can be killed through no fault of your own. Still, it's fun to try to figure out the hidden roles. Not a great game, but good every once in a while.

RATING: 4
Fun for the first few games but isn't of much interest after that. Half the games have someone eliminated before they even get one turn, otherwise it's a race to kill the Sheriff before the 'good guys' eliminate the 'bad'.  The Renegade is doomed to lose.  As an appetizer for an evening's gaming, the elimination aspect requires a filler game for this filler game.  Too light for a main course and but as an occasional dessert (where the eliminated can just go home) it's reasonably entertaining.

Nice western themed game where the players roles are hidden.
The gameplay based on shooting, as the game's name suggests, works fine and it plays fast.
But it has some limitations:
* it doesn't work with few players
* with beginners there are too many rules and special cards to get rapidly into it [tip: just set aside some special cards to avoid them in the first game with newbies]
* and sometimes it takes too long from the "first deaths" till the end of the game.

Played this once and didn't enjoy it at all.  For me the worst part was that so many of the cards have a book icon that means "look up what this card does in the rulebook." I know you want your game to be language independent and all, but that makes for a much worse experience.  Putting that major design flaw aside, the rest of the game isn't much fun anyway.

After a few plays it seems like the sweet spot for this game is 5 players. It's crazy fun then. With 7 it just has too much downtime. With an even number, it seems a little unbalanced.(Not that balancing should necessarily matter a lot in a game like this)

Maybe I should have played this with more than 4 players, but if the box says 4 players or up, I assume it works with that number and is not "really the same game" (quote). I found this boring and dull, more like a random trick taking game, almost zero strategy and way too much luck for a game that simple. Not my cup of tea. I much prefer the similar Cash N Guns. HX

RATING: 4.8
Needs at least 4 players to be any good at all, since distance from other players is a major feature of the game.  I liked it the first time, but upon replay, I saw its flaws more clearly.  Player elimination leaves people sitting with nothing to do while the rest of the game plays out, and as the turn goes around the table a player mostly sits there as a target with nothing to do (a bigger problem if there are more players).  Your choices are dictated to you by the very limited number of cards you draw, and almost every choice is obvious.  (He shot at me, do I play my MISSED card, or not?  Duh... I'm down a couple of hits, and drew a BEER card, do I play it or not?  Duh...)  I've decided this isn't nearly as good of a game as I thought after the first time I played it.

I've become a far bigger fan of Bang in recent times, especially after adding in the expansions. Sure, it isn't always the most strategic game, but the chaotic fun that ensues can be incredibly entertaining.

RATING: 6
Fun game, though premature and permanent death can be somewhat of a fun-killer. Fortunately the game plays fairly quickly so this is not a terrible downside. Character cards do seem like they could use more balance as there are some that are clearly better than others (Willie the Kid, for example). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
fun game for family gatherings and for playing with non-gamer friends. i wish that the card instructions were printed on the cards in a more straight-forward manner. the way they are shorthanded with the use of symbols makes the learning curve for this game unnecessarily higher, making the first few teaching plays tedious. it's also pretty random--it is just take that card game and all the players share one single draw pile, so there's no way to insure you draw anything useful on your turn. the game can drag on on sometimes and is way too light to enjoy past 20 or so minutes of play time, so play it quickly without over thinking your turns.

Spaghetti-western card game that's a riot with non-gaming crowds.  Takes a them a bit to get the card symbols down but once they do watch out!  So far it hasn't disappointed with many plays...

My most played game ever since discovering BGG.  4 or 5 of my co-workers now own a set themselves and it was a big holiday hit in 2005.  One co-worker went so far as to make a DIY High Noon set!  I have them whipped by this game!

Bang can be a lot of fun with a group of 6-7 people, any less and it gets a little too easy figuring out who is who.  I like the theme, I like the fact that they cleaned it up with the 4th edition and you don't constantly have to ask to see the rulebook to know what your cards do. I find that while some games can be very tense and exciting, unfortunately others can drag on and be painful.  I don't like the fact that people can be eliminated before they even get a turn. Overall it is a game I enjoy and will continue to play it when I have the right amount of people.

RATING: 5.5
In many ways, I like Bang!  I like the theme, the art on the cards is generally well done, and it facilitates a lot of fun interaction between players (a little role playing is fun!)

So....why the low rating?  There are a few things I just can't get past.  First, some players can and will get eliminated quickly.  Player elimination is always a bad idea in my opinion (even if it is thematic here).  I have seen folks killed before they get a turn in a six player game.  Sorry, that is just bad design.  If I sit down to play a game, only to get one or two turns and then get eliminated and have to wait thirty minutes doing nothing I am not happy.

Speaking of doing nothing, cards like "Jail" shouldn't be in the game.  This is essentially "Lose a Turn", another mechanic I hate.  I play games to PLAY GAMES, not to have a jail card played on me and watch everyone else play.

The Renegade role seems a really tough assignment, too.  I get why it exists - to make it more difficult to decide who is lawful and who is an outlaw.  Playing it though, kind of stinks.  Really tough for everything to align for a renegade victory.

Despite all this, BANG is still kind of fun, but it's only fun if you get to stay in the game.  I want to like it - I really do - but just too much downtime/elimination.

The fun to be had in this game totally depends on the group you're playing it with. Any kind of slowdown, especially with a larger group, just kills the game for me.

Players will be assigned to teams - Sheriff and deputies vs Outlaws - or play all for themselves as the Renegade. The Outlaws just want to kill the Sheriff. The Sheriff and deputies must kill the outlaws and renegade. The renegade must kill everyone. The twist is that all roles are confidential except for the Sheriff.

Players will have lots of different cards to play; some shoot at other players, some allow them to duck other players shots, some replenish their health, some let them put another player in jail, and many more.

SOLD (04/14/2017) - The need for a sizable group for maximum enjoyment, coupled with the player elimination issues resulted in me selling this title.

Bang is a decent party game, quite suitable to medium sized groups. 

The idea is pretty simple, all but one person has a hidden role. But the interactions can make for a very fun game! It is a game with player elimination, so when you have very conservative players - it can go on for a while. 

Definitely not a go-to game, it is a game I will join in if there is nothing else going on at the time.

Faster and less annoying than Mafia/Werewolf. I do wish there were a little more deduction going on in games with less than 7 people -- it'd lead to more talking overall. Sometimes takes too long for what it is, especially if roles are clustered together.

With a lot of people, this one actually just drags for a really long time. I think 5 is the optimal number. With the latter size group and people who know how to play, this is an 8. With a larger group or a lot of people who don't know how to play, this drops to a 5 or a 6; Bang is not fun when it drags.

My 8 yr old boys can't get enough of this game and I am happy to play with them. I find the game clever and fun with a great theme. However, don't bother spending a lot of time on strategizing. There is some planning in how you play a particular hand but planning ahead is virtually impossible. All in all, I highly recommend this game if you are playing with boys.

Very fun card game. Even more fun with the right group. I like that after a play, it seems we always want to play one more. Each game is different with the changing characters. You may not want to be the sheriff  if you don't want to be shot at a lot from the get go.

I've had some great games and a few duds. Must be in the mood for this one, as well as all playing.

BANG!

Situationally good.  I wouldn't play it very often on a game night.  But I am a Scoutmaster and the Scouts love this game.  I bring it on camping trips and it absorbs almost all of them, which keeps them contained and avoids forest fires. :)

RATING: 8
Very good group game.  However the game can drag out for a long time if no one goes after the sheriff.  Also it can be frustrating if you get killed early and have to wait until everyone else finishes playing.  I actually bought this one for a friend for Christmas back in like 2003 and that is how I got introduced to it. (2004)

A good game of Bang! requires 6-8 players (still haven't tried it with 5, but I suppose it would be balanced), which makes it a rare treat. But whenever we bang, everyone seems to enjoy it. Players being eliminated and games taking too long is a small problem...

I enjoyed the game that I played, but it was more because of the people I played with than the game itself. 

The game is kind of like the one where people are trying to figure out who the werewolves are before they kill the townspeople. Except you use cards. And stuff.

Speaking of the cards, there are too many rules that aren't written on the cards. End result: too much to remember in the first play.

A lot of details and special cases for what feels like it should be a more streamlined fast game.  The gimmick of not knowing other peoples' roles didn't seem sufficiently interesting to me, and seems to cause people to shoot at others randomly, whether that will be good or bad for them.  For shooting other people, I'd rather play the elegant fun game Cash and Guns.

Bang! ... you're dead!

I love this game. Yes, for some new comers it may be a little confusing. But once you get the hang of the cards there is no stopping you. I've played with the old and young and everyone enjoys it. 

I have taken the Distance(Gun and Horse) cards out of the game. It seems to make everything a little more simple.

Plus, try playing this game as a drinking game for some real fun. Also a great way to introduce the game with friends who are new to games. Every time get shot you drink. And every time you regain a life point you drink!

Get a little creative and make your own Bang! cards.

This and citadels are my two favorite card games.  I love that a great number of people can play at one time.  I love how everybody's character is hidden at the beginning like that of Mafia or Werewolf (except the Sheriff of course).  I love the expansions that add more characters, guns, booze, and more.  This is a great game, and really fun to play.  The one down side is that some players might be eliminated from the game early, and then those players must passively wait and do nothing but watch.  Because of this, some of the people I like to play games with do not like this game.  but still, I highly recommend this game.  It's highly affordable, easy to carry around (small package), and a ton of fun.

RATING: 7
Fun and often frenetic! The only downside for me really is that playing time can be hard to predict. We have the third edition and prefer it to the fourth: the bullet tokens and player boards are just bloat. I like randomness and chaos and this delivers. And oh the stories this produces! In one memorable game the end dragged on for a while but the finish sure worth waiting for: After the outlaws were down the renegade and the deputy started duking it out. The sheriff didn't know which was which but finally shot down the deputy. It was just a fabulous scene to imagine: amidst lots of firing back and forth between others the sheriff finally chances it and pulls the trigger, only to take out her only friend. She falls to the ground dropping all her equipment and weeps. Helpless and cardless she waits for the renegade to finish her off, barely lifting her gaze at the barrel of his gun. Just then, that stick of dynamite that's been going around for several rounds now explodes under the renegade's feet. The sheriff wins, with nothing left of anyone else or her equipment.

Update: Cash 'n Guns has shown itself to be a strong competitor to this as they are both really party games. I'm on the lookout for a wild west shooting game that would be more tactical, more focused than Bang! At the same time, I can't forget the thrilling moments I've had with Bang!, so I'm on the fence about trading it. Would when I don't consider previous plays, won't when I do...

Traded away. A little queasy about it when I think back, there's memories attached to this game. I'd want to add something to it though, and the Bullet edition has everything. Might get this back in some years, if we dont' live near anyone that has it. Right now though, there's quite a few copies in our circle.

I don't want to be too hard on Bang!, since it was one of the first hobby games I got into after Catan. But the truth is that it's kind of a dumb game.

For some reason Mrs. Kringle got unduly excited when I came home from work one day and said I wanted to play this game.  I mean, she got really really excited.  Very strange.  But when Toby, head elf in charge of Nintendo Wii's, put her in jail on turn two and she stayed there until she was killed, her enthusiasm waned severely.  This game has never come back out, and I spent the night on the couch.  Shrug.

This is a nice little game. Not overly complicated, easy for the kids to pick up. My 5 y/o likes this, although he does not quite grasp the concept of being the renegade (help the sheriff kill the outlaws first).

The mechanics are very easy to understand, and the variable powers are a lot of fun. Having secret roles greatly enhances the game.

Some of the characters just aren't fun, like the gravediggers, and players being eliminated tends to suck. 

Dodge City adds cool new characters, however the greens and new blues make it more likely to come to a one on one game with two well equipped characters, as the others just wait for the game to end.

I like Bang! and I prefer it to the dice version.  The game can run a little long, however, and winning as the Renegade is too difficult to make it much fun for the player who draws that role.  There are better social deduction games out there now.  I'll give it a few more plays for old times' sake, but this may be on the trade pile.

Bang's strength is that it supports an unusally high number of players (seven), but because it's an elimination game all but two of those players will be spending a lot of time twiddling their thumbs. The endgame seems to drag a bit also, without lots of players piling on to eliminate the injured. With the right group I think it could be a lot of fun, but there are much better, non-elimination games you can play with this number (e.g. Saboteur). Or you could play Werewolf, which does the same thing at the right game length.

My strategy is to try and get eliminated first so that I can set up a two player game to play with the next person to be eliminated.

This game is awesome...
...if you play fast! People who take long turns ruin this game. You don't stop and think in a game like this. After all, you would take a minute to decide your turn while standing in the middle of the town at high noon, would you?

If it's played right, it's just absolutely hilarious. You have a Sheriff placing a few rounds into his Deputy with a winchester, two Outlaws firing at each other while accusing the other of being a lowly white-hat deputy, and a Renegade trying to let everyone else destroy each other.  Just awesome for the right group.

In its day this was fun. But it has been completely supplanted by Bang the Dice game.

Old Review
This game is a bargain. It's fun, light, and the random roles keeps things interesting. The pace can slow down if you have 6 or 7 players. But if everyone has their head in the game, it's a blast. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Any game where someone can get eliminated before they even get a turn is kind of a turn off.  I also was not a fan of the shared victory conditions.  The game is OK, but not something I am ever going to be terribly excited to play.

Good for a light card game that plays up to 7 players.  Different players having different victory conditions which overlap in places adds to the fun.

Some of the special cards make explaining the rules take longer.

This game is amazing for the following reason... I had 6 frisbee players (i.e. not gamers) at my house, and I suggested we play Bang! instead of random regular card games. We tried it, and immediately everyone wanted to play it again. We played for about 6 hours straight.

RATING: 4
Deduction filler for large groups.

I don't care if the Italian text adds flavor to the game. You can't make a light filler, then make it such that you have no idea what the cards do without using the rulebook (for the special cards). I like the hidden roles and picking your character in the beginning, but HATE the player elimination. Will still play just for the double entendres. Still have to try this with a large group (only tried with 4). Also must try playing in a game where I'm the only guy in it and can Bang! all I want. :devil:

Werewolves with practically no psychology, fueled by deck of random cards. 

It's neat - the theme works, the build up is slow and comfy. Everything totally depends on the cards you get (well plus some guessing work), especially the blue cards are quite powerful. So: lots of luck, not that much bluffing, deducing, which means you're in it for the ride. Also for same reason: good for kids and people who don't know each other. 

Better than Muchkin, not as good as Cash&Guns or Citadels. A neat ride when you want it. 

EDIT: Iconitis sucks for such a light game.

RATING: 7
Combining elements of Werewolf and Miles Borne, Bang! is a great party hit. There are not too many cards to learn so that new people can jump right in. I love the unknown role factor and the idea that where you sit at the table makes a difference.
The only issue the game has is that someone could get killed quite early and thus be out of the action.

Given the amount of plays this could be considered my #1 party game. Personally, I do not like the game that much, it has too many drawbacks for my liking (player elimination, highly luck driven, with some people it even gets very annoying). But it is enjoyed by many people I game with and it is an easy choice for a relaxing game with 5-7 people to play.
I would not recommend to play the game with someone who likes to think a lot. This is not a thinking game. Or just quickly shoot him.

Quick, quirky little card game.  Can be a little tricky to learn what all the cards do, but is pretty easy to pick up.  Can be played with 4 players, but is definitely more enjoyable the closer you get to 7 players.  Being the Sheriff is pretty much a death sentence with 4-5 players.

A wild west shoot 'em up. This silly card game is quite funny and doesn't take too long. There is player elimination though, so that can cause some people to cry in their soup.

UPDATE: My last couple of games have actually taken quite a while to play. I'm kind of on the fence about Bang! For now I'll drop my rating to a 6. If I play again and have a better time I won't hesitate to return it to a 7 though. Perhaps I'm just testy because I was the one crying in my soup this time.

[2 plays] This is a fluffy party game that even grown men feel no embarassment in enjoying. I enjoyed it some the first time. However, it outstays its welcome, player elimination (or castration - I once spent the whole game in jail) can be a bummer, and there are definitely better games for light social filler.

Most recent play 11-16-05 with Brian, Michael, James, Berna, and David.

Dropped from an original rating of 7. The initial excitement has worn off on this one.

A more aggressive High Noon/Fistful of Cards mechanic would be great.

I readily enjoyed playing this when it was first purchased. The problem is dealing with never-ending games...which has happened quite often. The distance cards make the game too cumbersome and nullify strategy. I've played games where I can never shoot the person I need to. This game will collect dust quickly...or is in desperate need of a variant rule facelift.

Light, inexpensive game with plenty of theme. The game can drag a bit, which is a problem if some of the players get eliminated early. It's also quite difficult to win with the Renegade, but Bang is still fun if you don't take it too seriously. Probably best with 5-6 players.

Played it a lot.  Played it too much.  It is a thematic and fun game but you can lose without making a play and that does not make for a great game.  In fact you can win without making a play!

Funny game of shootouts. However, the game is extremely dependent on the luck of the draw of cards. The bluff element is there but card draw is just overriding here. A case of luck and guess which opponent to hit. Don't expect strategy here. Overrated game.

It's mafia/werewolf the card game. It's suppose to be quick and dirty but sometimes it takes longer than it should. Some players drag this one out too long. They'll start hoarding cards and are afraid to shoot at anyone.  

When the games are quick it's a fun filler.

The innuendo can be immaturely funny and can really add to the trash talking.

Card, Hidden Roles. Fun Western-themed shootout game with three sides trying to win. Only downside is player elimination in a game that can sometimes run a little long (for a filler).

Update: I definitely like the dice game better. Most or all of the fun, fraction of the playing time.

Fun Chaotic beer and pretzels game.  If you like games like Family Business, then you probably will like this one.  Good for non-gamers and drinking.  Don't look for anything deep, but there is are high probabilities for fun.  The only strategy is knowing when to hold your cards, and some minor bluffing.  There is one problem though, there is ALWAYS one person out of the required 7 it takes for this game to be fun, that has a terrible time, it kinda ruins the fun for us all.  Because of this the rating suffers.

We love Bang! It's a fun action/ deductive cowboy game. Draw a card, and bang! You lose a life point. 

It's important to keep a fast pace in the game, or the game tend to get long and to much waiting till it's your turn. So more doing than thinking.

Five minutes of fun packed into ninety minutes of playtime. Cute filler, but almost totally luck-driven. Early elimination makes for a rotten time, as the game can last for a very long time.

“This is the sheriff you're talking about, with a gun and badge that enforces the law.”

One of the worst game in existance, for me.
2 minutes of "bluffing" where basically everybody claims being the Deputy, followed by 28 minutes of drawing cards and almost automatically playing them because choices are trivial.
Oh, and it has player elimination. Blergh.

Look at my ratings - I don't have any trouble with crazy chaotic games. (In fact, a lot of times I prefer them.) What kills Bang! is that you need at least five players for the game to function properly, and with five players craving a chaotic filler I will always default to Magical Athelete or Shadow Hunters.

It's a no for me -- it has a few things I don't like, such as player elimination and those random card draws when you really need to have something to use.  But back in 2002, I'd probably have thought it was great gaming.  Things have just gotten so much better.

Maybe it's the people that I've played this with, but the deduction/bluffing didn't play nearly as big of a role as I thought it would.  

At its core, its a hand-management beer-and-pretzels player elimination game where it doesn't ever feel like progress is made.  More often than not, I've seen games decided by the Dynamite card, which makes me feel like I could have just played a round of Russian Roulette and saved the overhead of the game.

I've only played it a handful of times, and I already feel like I'm just going through the motions of playing it.

Started out as a 6, and upon further review, lowering this to a 5.  I just don't like games that you have some cards and your whole world revolves around the cards.  It's hard to identify the teams, and the sheriff is a lousy position as he's the only one that is an obvious target.

UPDATE: Moving this to a 4, as I have a hard time seeing me agree to play this again.

Fun group to play with a large group. That is unless you're among the first to be taken out. Then you can find yourself wondering if the game will ever end!

RATING: 5
Can be fun with a large group. The hidden roles, team-based gameplay, and the wild west theme go a long way. Player elimination is an issue, and the game can go on a lot longer than it should, but there's nothing more satisfying than being in (and winning) the final duel. Distill that into a game and I'd be elated. Like Citadels, with the right group, in the right mood, Bang! works wonderfully. Beer and a group of good friends who don't mind filling time with conversation. That's the key.  In the wrong context, with the wrong group, it can be painful.

Watered down version of SanGuoSha, however this is much easier to teach as most of my friends don't read Mandarin. Characters are less interesting, weapons are less interesting.

The cards have Italian and English text on them, making some cards feel cluttered.

This game reminds me of Fluxx, my least favorite game, in the sense that many say it's not meant to be taken seriously.  Translation:  there isn't much to the actual gameplay; it's pretty random.  Others say speaking in western accents improves the Bang! experience.  Yee-hah!  Me and my horse will ride on to a different game. Update:  Played a couple more times (not at my choosing) and everyone enjoyed it except me.  Very luck-driven, which would be okay if it wasn't so easy to deduce who is playing each character.  Bumped it up one point for good group interaction.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is one of my favorite hidden role games because there's so much interaction with the other players.  Games like The Resistance don't do anything for me because you don't interact with the other players besides the normal mind and word games to figure out who they are.  Bang! still has all that and so much more.  You can still interrogate and try to get the other players to slip up and reveal who they are while at the same time playing a Western-themed card game.  I've played it so much I've lost a little love for it, but it is still an incredibly well-designed, fun, and exciting game and one of the best games with hidden role mechanics that I've played.  I will concede it can be really crappy when the odds are against a player and they find themselves eliminated quickly and watching the game finish from the sidelines though.

Ah, the game I wanted so desparately to like because it looked and sounded so cool.  Maybe we didn't have the right people because this game has many fans on BGG.  I just didn't connect with it though my kids really enjoyed it.  I can easily see other people rating this much higher.

Hoot 'n hollering good time every time Bang! hits the table. Passive narrative element, which can be strong if players realize it and piece together what happens.

Rated down from a solid 9 because games tend to last anywhere between 15 to 60 minutes depending on the draws. Game feels like it drags if it goes any longer than 30 minutes.

A rather silly cardgame, not to be taken too seriously. Sure, the roles are pretty unbalanced and some roles are more fun than others, but that's beside the point. It's more of an activity than a game.
A nice starter for the evening, Bang is best played very fast. Eliminated players can go on playing something else. The icons are unfortunately not very useful. The best advice to new players: if you don't understand what a card does, simply play it and find out.

Had fun playing it, but it is not without problems...
 - Roles are unbalanced - outlaws beat sheriff, who beats renegade
 - the cards that alter the relative position are confusing (maybe it is just a problem with the similar icons?)
 - not a lot of thought goes into who you should be attacking, unless maybe you are the renegade, though you are probably going to lose anyway if you are.

Best treated as a light, filler - though the length of the game seems like it can vary quite a bit.

In Italian.  Makes it challenging to interpret the rules.  There is some guesswork trying to deduce what other players are doing to take advantage of it, but a lot of the game is trying to attack the other players.

too long, too dull.  Some games play very quickly, and if it could always be that way, it might get a slightly higher rating from me.  But as it is written, it has the potential to play at about 3 or 4 times the length of time a game of its weight should take.

I have played this game many times and it has always been enjoyable. I used to play with a group of 5 friends and at one point this game was one of the only games that we could all agree on to play. That being said, I have not played it since the dice version of the game cam out. Although I don't own the dice version, I have been contemplating getting it for quit a while and will probably own it in the near future. The dice game and the card game hold numerous similarities in how they play but the dice version takes considerably less time and for a social interaction and deception game, that it makes the dice version a much better choice in my opinion.

Great fun, easy to teach and pick up the rules. This game is all about bluffing. The mechanics and strategy are pretty simple, but where the real magic happens is the deception, redirection, and psychological mind-bending as everyone tries to fool each other and play all the other sides against each other (not to mention your choice of cheesy Italian or cheesy Western accents while playing). "Not me, Sheriff, I'm legit!" out one side of your mouth, "No way, pardner, I don't truck with the law!" out the other.

There lighter games are never my favorites but this one was fun given the number of players we had and it provided some interesting variety on game night.

[daVinci games 03 edition] {American West; variable-player-powers, partnership, player elimination, deduction, variable-winning-goal; optimal 6p} Bang! is an interesting thematic role-play game. It is full of player interactions and gossips. It is more suitable for aggressive plays; if most players try their best to avoid confrontation / hide their identity, the game dies. It's fun; esp. for families and general players; hardcore gamers decide / plan too much and destroy the flow of the game! It allows certain kinds of strategies; esp. for the Renegade.

The rules are long but not complex. It takes less time to teach the rules but the players may need some time to get used to the cards. The FAQ is quite helpful to handle special situations.

[Update] The Deluxe version is really attractive.  Unless I can trade away Bang! and Dodge City, I would not get it.

[Expansions] High Moon is good to have, but not necessary. Dodge City is a nicer choice. Fist of handful cards is not necessary unless you think the Sheriff is too weak.

The theme with the two hidden groups is nice (a la Werewolf), but cannot carry the game, which at the end of the day is a bad version of Magic's "Grand Melee", which all serious players were hating.

I like playing this game every once in awhile, but I dislike having my "dead" guests sit out while the rest of the group finishes the game. Elimination games are not a favorite of mine unless the elimination happens very rapidly.

I heard a lot of great things about this game but I don't really get it. Played it a few times and not really into it. Hidden powers sounds cool but it just doesn't quite work. The Resistance and Coup are both much better takes on this sort of concept.

I enjoy the chaos this game brings. The biggest drawback is the cryptic icon system and the range rules. I think that those 2 things keep my rating down a bit. I suppose if I played it more the icons and range would become second nature, but for a filler for a large group 6 Nimmt! works much better.

Great game for a bigger group!  Lots of fun and lots of theme.  Also like that you can play games pretty quick so you can play it a few times.  It is an elimination game however, sometimes players who get killed early end up waiting a while for the next game to start.  Also, new players have a hard time the first game or two learning all the card meanings.  You must play this several times to really appreciate it, although I had fun the very first time.  Good idea to play without the 12 "advanced" cards when playing with new players.

RATING: 9
Very fun game, the only drawback being the large number of players required.  Fun to roleplay if you can do a decent Clint Eastwood impression.  The usually-brief playing time makes it an excellent game to play at towards the end of the evening when you have time for "just one more."  The short playing time is also nice for those players who get eliminated early on--they don't have to wait forever before playing again.

RATING: 4.75
Used to enjoy this because it was one of the few social deduction games out there. But as time has gone on it really fails to hold up. The fact there is Player Elimination and tons of imbalances and randomness and more is just not my cup of tea anymore. I'd rate it a 5 or a 5.25, but the components are pretty bad and the dual language and heavy use of iconography knocks it down to a much lower rating. Not something I'd really play unless there was no other social deduction game option.

Bang! is Mafia with a western twist and a very engaging style of play. It's a game of deception (and also power in the case of the Sheriff) and it's very satisfying when you start figuring out the others' roles while concealing your own. The point in which you openly reveal what role you have is very important. The only setback this game has is when there are players that either do not know how to play their roles correctly or when you have players that reveal who they are from the get-go (either accidentally or intentionally).

Played 15+ times.  Requires the right group of people and good for a round of laughs.  Shoot some people and try to figure out who's who but mostly just shoot people.  Just meant to be played quickly and for fun.  (I like the variant that your hand size doesn't go down as you get killed. The original rule really hoses the people who get shot early.  I suppose the variant could make the game longer and upset the balance of some roles, but at least you still get to do something.  - doesn't save the game though).  2010/07/07

It was sort of an interesting novelty at first but after several plays I now refuse to play this as the game length, as well as down time between turns is horrible. the last time we played, I think we had 7 players and it took 3 hours. WHich is too much for me for any game unless it was some epic strategic game. 

The slow down time between turns also really kills the theme of a wild west gunfight. It is more about figuring out who is on what side than anything to do with shooting people. This also starts to kill the excitement as the most strategy revolves around the mystery roles, and after an hour or so you begin to have an idea, but it will still take many turns before you can finish off certain players. The latter stages of the game more resemble a siege than anything else.

I use to think highly of this game. But I think Werewolf is the better game, which is sad, because the theme of this game is excellent. The problem with this game is that it has too much luck, very possible early player elimination, and if you're not drawing the right cards, your options can be pretty limited. Plus every game seems to last way too long.

I've got a feeling that Cash 'n' Guns is the game that gives me what I wanted out of this game.

Too long. The game claim that you have to "discover" the role of each player. But the game is about shooting: the ones who shot the sheriff are the bad guys, the ones who shot the bad guys are he good ones. The hidden roles disappear soon. And then there is an agony of "bang / missed" turns where the luckiest guy wins.

Bang!  YEHAW!  This here cardgame is an absolute blast!  Ain't no tumbleweeds in this here town.  The game is oozing with spagetti western theme.  Mechanics are easy to teach and pictorial (except a select few cards with the book icon).  Really easy to understand as well, minimal learning curve.  Brilliant little game about bluffing with a quick pace, the shots just keep coming.  Heavy roleplaying element with the right group of players and laughs all the way through.  The player elimination is unfortunate but still doesn't retract too much from the game.  Amazing party game, the more players the more fun!  I really enjoy a good bang from time to time.

It's fun, but honestly?  I'd rather player Werewolf.  Bang!, though, is nice at lower player counts where Werewolf often fails.

Revised September 2009 from 5 to 7 - played it with a new group of people and it was a hit.  It always fell flat before, but with a new group it took off and it's been oft-requested.  I took out the most complicated cards for the first play and explained the basics, and that got everyone involved.  Some games you just need the right group!  I'm even considering getting the Bullet to offer greater versatility in play.

Revised July 2012 from a 7 to 7.5 - a minor upgrade but I picked up the version in the larger box that actually changes the cards so that you don't have to go to the manual to see what so many of them do.  This is a HUGE help in introducing the game.

Bang is my go-to game for killing time with my sports team.  They seem to love it, so I keep it around.  

I do see the negative qualities though.  In particular, I'm often the first one eliminated.  It usually happens when I've just explained the game, and no one wants to target someone who doesn't know how to play, so instead they shoot at me.

RATING: 6
Was enjoyable for a while, but now it's monotonous.  A player's hand will play itself, and there is no real strategy or tactics to speak of.  Some cards are really useless.  Figuring out range is a headache when there are blue cards and character cards that change the distance.  I'm also sick and tired of being asked what different cards do.  Hidden role mechanic seems like an afterthought, not as integral to the experience as in, say, Saboteur or Werewolf.

The game is almost always decided by dynamite.

The hidden roles are a myth.  After one round, pretty much everyone knows who everyone else is.  The most interesting games are the ones where for some reason people get confused.  Unfortunately, that pretty much always means the sheriff wins.  All that said, I still have fun playing this if there are enough players.

I've come to enjoy "secret role" type games a lot recently, having played Saboteur, Saboteur 2 and The Resistance. So I was hoping this would play something like Resistance, but with the addition of some extra stuff to do each turn, and a dash of comedy chaos. In theory, that's exactly what this game is, but somehow the sum of the parts adds up to much less than the whole. The secret role aspects don't work anywhere near as well as Resistance, or even Saboteur, leaving you either totally in the dark over who to attack, or making it painfully obvious. The shooting mechanic quickly gets tiresome too. It's a shame, as I thought this would be a lot of fun.

Our new best-loved card game! The whole family love it. You don't know what happenned in the next time with you. The only problem is that with 4 people, the game is calculable, you know who is the renegat, you know the bandits, except if you played with a very good poker faced people. With 5 or more people the game is more exciting, and the cards are less - I think we need to buy expansions.

A nice game, but the rules are somehow complex and there are so many various cards and special abilities affecting each players' status at any one time that stuff gets easily forgotten even after several games.

Fun when played with the right group, but has its dark side.

Can drag, and especially evil if the guy on your right plays dynamite, lives, and then it blows up on you in the first turn.  Then you sit and wait 90 mins for everyone else to finish.   Not the best party game..

Just played once with 7 people. The game dragged on a little too long, but that was probably because people didn't understand the psychology or strategy of the game.

For all of the complexity baked into the cards, bullets, and now player mats, Bang! is really a simple card game that relies heavily on social interaction.  If the group that you're playing with has a lot of personality, the game will flourish.  The Dodge City! expansion is nearly required.

A rough and tumble gunfightin' card game that really brings out the cowboys in everyone. Play with a cheatsheet, as some cards lack important rules text. Works great with larger numbers and fast play, though the game can occasionally drag due to a slow player or a random shuffle (especially in expansion games). Tip -- Discard health cards permanently when used. This will guarantee the game will come to a speedy end.

Western theme is bursting here. Renegade controls the balance of power between the outlaws and the law. Anticlimactic as the best part of the game is the middle where teams whittle each other down. The final 3 is only tense if there's a renegade/outlaw/sheriff stand off.

Rules used:
Play with Expansion Characters, but only the Basic cards.

It's alright.  I like Bang! but want to enjoy it more than I do. It's hard to enthusiastically endorse a game in which you can be gunned down before you even have a turn.  It would also be nice if the hidden role mechanism mattered a little more.  When it's on, it's on, though, and I love the player powers and overall presentation.  Generally I'd reach for Cash n Guns if I wanted a firearms-themed party game, but I'll still break this out when I can.

A great blend of the "take that" card game elements found in games like "Magic: The Gathering" and the hidden role gameplay of games like "Werewolf/Mafia." Suffers slightly because it is not as easy to explain to new players as one would expect for such a light weight game.

It's the large-group game we keep returning to. Plus, who doesn't want to shout out to a buddy (without any of the usual repercussions) "I'm gonna Bang(!) your wife."? We added a house rule whereby each player draws two character cards, selects the favourite between the two, and simply uses the other to track life points--this helps people feel less like they got cheated if they get a lame character.

This has yet to live up to its promise -- with 4 players, hidden roles are pointless, and 6 players seems skewed toward the outlaws too much.  Would love to try it with 7, though.  Also, provided another great gaming moment:

M. is shooting at B. with a volcanic.

M:  Bang!

B:  Missed.

M:  Bang!

B:  Missed.

M (ever more desperate):  *Bang!*

Fun, interactive game of "take that" with a dash of deduction thrown into the mix.  Not too much to think about here, and the player elimination can leave some players twiddling their thumbs, but it's still a fine diversion every once in a while.  Definitely gets bonus points for handling up to seven players.

UPDATE: With more experience with other, better games, Bang's flaws have been harder to overlook.  Or maybe it fits a niche that I'm not really interested in.  This doesn't get to the table anymore and I can't imagine it ever being played except by my high school students - and even then I'd rather sit out.

Mafia (Werewolf) the abridged version. What makes bang great is that, Mafia or Werewolf whichever you prefer to call it, can't work in small group.

This game banged the group I first tried it with and we played it 8 times in a row... I rarely see a game arouse so much interest.. 

It's a highly interactive gunsling "simulation" game, with some interesting light deduction elements. It does create a good narrative, it is dripping in theme and flows well.

However it is too random and chaotic for my taste, and not too elegant. Some games may end quickly enough, but some may drag insanely long. Combine this with player elimination and you get a game that may force someone to watch instead of play..

It generally is a fun game, with the right crowd.

It is not a hidden roles game, really, since 2-3 rounds in, everyone's role is obvious.

It is slightly deeper than WAR, I suppose, but the outcome of the game still feels very much determined by the cards that you draw. Nothing is more disheartening to watch the sheriff whittle down two bandits while they desperately search the deck for a gun with enough range.

Its could be a fun closer for game nights and for nights with lots of alcohol involved.  I prefer citadels for this role, but this is a good changeup.  Too many rule conflicts with the expansion.

Good game, but went on for a little too long. I felt like I had no control regarding if I got killed or not. I was a deputy, and the sheriff killed me in cold blood because I couldn't convince him I was a deputy, even though I kept shooting the renegade and an outlaw the whole game.

Okay lightweight game, but too many of the cards are the same. There's just too little variety at the end of the day for my liking. Still, love the theme and the fact that nobody knows (at first) who's a deputy and who's an outlaw. Be warned: this game really only cooks with 5 or 7 players IMHO.

Seriously flawed hidden role game that hinges on the moment in which the outlaws turn on the sheriff.  With no way to get extra information, before that moment everyone just shoots randomly, and after that moment, everyone just shoots the outlaws.  The flavor is great, and there IS potential here, it's just wasted potential.

This is a pure fun-factor game, and is obviously not going to make anyone General Patton by the choices they make.

I've cooled a bit on Bang! lately... It seems like you run out of cards way too fast, and your options become very limited as the game continues on.  I've seen a couiple of matches drag out to almost an hour, which seems insane for a game of this simplicity.

As other users have said on BGG, there is better filler around.

RATING: 5
I'm pretty late to the bandwagon on this one, but I finally got around to playing it.  

And... it's not horrible?  But to be honest I'm not even that convinced that it's not.  It's a player elimination game where you can get knocked out early and wait around a long time.  And it's all card dependent, which mostly means you're at the luck of the draw.  The one real game element are the hidden roles and trying to figure out who is who and work with your team or pretend to be on the other team.

It was a fun quick play when I played it.  But if I had gotten knocked out and/or the game had dragged on, it would have gotten old fast.

Don't get to play it as much as I would like because we usually have a group of 4, but I like Bang! with 5.

I have heard that the dice game is as good if not better, so will have to try that out sometime.

RATING: 5
I wish this game had a little more role-guessing and saving others. There's almost no reason in most of the games I've played to NOT attack another person. I wanted deduction, but didn't get it (Shadow Hunters, BSG, and my unpublished Golems of Ymhet do this better). Also, the iconography is fine for gamers, but for the target audience it isn't always clear.

This is a fun old west style shoot em up card game. It is fun with the right type of game playere. The only draw back I dont like is that if you die early you are left sitting out for the rest of the game.

RATING: 5
my first thoughts:
perfect light game, my family would love it. 

nextL i am starting to sour on it, after just a few plays...but mostly because the expansions make it too long and random.

now: pretty much never need to play again. Certain parts of the game make no sense...there is no incentive to keep the roles secret, because either the outlaws attack the sheriff and out themselves, or they attack randomly and just hurt each other. If the outlaws don't out themselves, the deputies are forced to play random. There is no drive for any other play. This and the good cards (guns, horses) make too big a difference and are so random. Also, a game for nongamers? then why do I need to explain Distance to Shoot over and over again?

RATING: 7
Quite fun, arguable better with 5 or 6 players.  With too many players there is a chance you are basically dead before your first turn.  Some issues with getting eliminated early and then sitting around for 30min, but if played light the banter is usually enough to keep you going.  Works great as a party game, and players can swap out if needed.

At first, I rather liked this game. I took it along on a typical African bush weekend, when some work colleagues and I were entertaining a visiting Aussie. It may have been the beer, the campfire and the African night, but we sat up until the early hours of the morning playing this game and honestly having a good time. Subsequent plays, however, have been rather dull and the game has lost it's allure for me.

A decent stab at a semi-diplomatic, quick card playing game with "Take that!" elements, with a modicum of strategy, that goes on a bit too long.  You need just the right set of brisk and aware players for this to come alive.

For a quick "Take that!" style game, I'd rather play Family Business.  For somewhat the same strategy and feel, I'd rather play Ca$h and Guns, which is quicker, more light-hearted, and has a higher "fun factor".

Seems like a great idea for a quick little game.  But it drags, and drags, and drags, and people seem to come back from the brink of death way too often.  Almost a very good game, but is rather one of the many games intended to hit the "quick, light" sweet spot that just goes on too long.  In the same time you could play China, or Samurai, or St. Petersburg.  One nice mechanic - using the back of two cards to show remaining life.  See my review.

RATING: 9
I can't help it that I love this game. It is one of my favorites. The main downside is it's best with 7-8 players and I seldom find so many with as much enthusiasm for it as I have (It is not the same playing even the best of games with those who don't get it or just don't care). The game itself is easy to learn and likely to appeal to a wide audience. The renegade is perhaps the funnest role for the bluffing factor (although generally difficult). Also there is an element of player elimination (but this seems minimized with the Wild West expansion in which dead characters can return, or roles can be switched). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8

More players is more fun for this game.  The potential for innuendo alone makes this a fun play!

RATING: 5
I only bought this game after I played it three times because it is so cheap and, as card games go, quite original (with a strong theme). So far (playing with 5 or 6 players), I did not enjoy playing the game too much. There is A LOT of randomness in there, and during my last session a player was actually removed from the game before he had the chance to play any cards himself. This was possible due to some "ganging up" and the starting hand dealt to each player.
UPDATE: Somehow, I played this game a lot more after this initial review and it really does grow on you! No choice but to raise the mark to a 7, for it is quite a reasonable party game.
UPDATE 2: Played this game again after a couple of years with players who are both familiar with it and like(d) it. After 2,5 hours of play (with 6 players) we stopped. It had been an agonizing experience. At least by todays standards the game has not been designed very well. Dropped rating to reflect how I feel about it now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's a game with some serious problem - too easy/party for gamers, too hard to explain for non-gamers. Player elimination is also an importante issue. Liked it a lot when I first discoverd modern board games, but then time passes, lots of other games came, and this one lost his place in collection.

Donated May 2017 to Pizzeria Ludica

Just never got this one to the table after probably 8 years. Mixed reviews from friends on both ends of the spectrum. Eurogames were top priority when I first got the game, and by the time my group started enjoying this style of game we had other ones like One Night Ultimate Werewolf, Avalon, and Coup that seemed to take its place.

Good game with larger crowds, but no more than 5. With 6, the downtime can be high. Since I hate elimination games, I think this game isn't all too great, but the theme sucks people in and the guessing keeps people entertained. I have played with people who totally enjoy this game. I have played this game enough times that it has lost its luster and appeal a tad bit. Still, this is one of the better fillers.

edit: This game really plays well with certain crowds and with newbies to the scene, it is really popular. However, this game is wearing me down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Bang! is an awesome card game with shoot-em-up and mafia elements, though I always find that at least one person gets completely screwed over when I introduce it to a new group. Requires a couple of plays for everyone to get a handle on it.

Edit: After diming this sucker, it's become abundantly clear that 7-8 players is a real slog. There's just too much downtime, and add in newbs or AP prone people and you've got a recipe for a dull grind. It's fun, but better with less.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game was fun for the first few games. After that it has been just more or less suffering. It is very chaotic and luck dependent and there is nothing more frustrating than play a game with 5-7 players, for ~1 hour, and dying in the very beginning - without a change to play ANY cards at all!

I picked up this game at DragonCon 04.  I've heard alot of good things about this game, it's only $10, and it's nice to have a game that plays with a large group, but still plays with 4-5 (our normal group size).  It's interesting light fare, and the different player goals adds an interesting element.  The group reaction was very positive.

The last couple games I've played really dragged on at the end.  I think that was due to the Dodge City expansion.  I think next time we will play without that (or maybe just with the characters from it).

The base game is entertaining and certainly builds upon the "Mafia" style games, not necessarily improving it. The rules in the rule book is ambiguous at best but implementing some play tested house rules certainly adds balance and diversity into the game. 

It is a very company-dependant game. It can get very dull in an uncompetitive and quiet crowd.

PS: if you are thinking of sleeping + expansions, get a card shoe.

In a sense, Bang! is the thinking man's Munchkin. You have a clear objective, but you don't know who your enemies are, and that makes for an interesting game.

Unlike Munchkin, this game doesn't punish players for wiping out the opposition. It is still luck-based, but when you're playing it, you feel like you have more control.

RATING: 6.5
Pros: random roleplaying, theme implemented well, party game for larger groups (can be played successfully with 8+ players), moderate strategic bluffing

Cons: player elimination, limited strategy, can overstay its welcome at times, looks like a social deduction game but doesn't really scratch that itch properly

One of the better party games out there, mainly because it does not feel like a stereotypical luck-driven party game. More decision-making than the average party game plus role-playing & intrigue is cause for a grand ol' time. A major downside of the game though is that the mystery of "who's who" rarely lasts more than a few turns, as there is no reason for the outlaws to delay attacking the sheriff, and from there it is easy to deduce everyone else's role.

Bang! is an easy to understand that is fun to play.  The more players--the more fun, but the expansion pack adds a lot.

This reminds me of the dozens of terrible party games put out by Hasbro on a yearly basis, only worse.  Disappointingly imbalanced.  Too long.  No strategy.  Too difficult to explain all the symbols to newbies, and not entertaining enough to bring out often enough to get familiar enough with the rules.  This game needs a full blown English edition, with the text on the cards.  It's difficult to understand what the card symbols mean, and the player aid cards don't really help.  This game is a study in bad design.  Why does this filler need EXACTLY seven players to work best?  That's a group size I almost never have around.  What, are we supposed to play it between games of [gameid=483] or something?

Nice "light" game using some interesting mechanics (hidden roles, a special power to each player, distance). Quite fun once everyone get used to the meaning of the cards. Better with 5 or 7 players.

I really like this game, but hate the elimination aspect.  The first game we ever played, I was killed after only 1 turn, and by my partner no less!  Attacking your partner happens and is all well and good, but spending the next 15-30 minutes watching others shoot at each other isn't.  This is really a problem with people who don't play games as often, and get very bored waiting around.

Still a favorite game but after 20 plays its wearing a bit thin. Too many times I'm eliminated in the first or second round. The sheriff is difficult to kill once he has established a huge stock of purple/green cards. I'll still never turn down the chance to play in a 7 or 8 player game of it though.

The theme of sheriff vs. outlaws is intriguing. The game can drag, so end result is not as good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty fun party game. However, the hidden roles are actually a little bit stupid. Shooting the sheriff pretty much immediately identifies you as an outlaw, and usually if you are an outlaw within range of the sheriff it is correct to immediately start shooting him. This means that sometimes the "hidden" roles are literally revealed in the first round of play, although there is always some ambiguity over which player is the Renegade and which player is the Deputy.

Another problem is that the Renegade never ever freaking wins, which can be frustrating if you're given his card over and over on a particular night.

Still, the flavor of the game is spot on, the special character abilities are great (albeit hilariously imba), and the game can get very tense if the battle is fair. Overall this is a game I'd never turn down, in spite of its problems.

Fast paced antagonistic card game where the players assume hidden roles and win or loose as a team (sherrif and helpers, bandits and the renegade who plays on his own). The interesting bit is that not only do you not know the other players' roles but even after you figure them out you cannot necessarily strike them if you don't own the proper guns. With the proper crowd can be really good fun. Suffers from early player elimination problems and needs at least 5 people to play properly.

Te-Chen brought it over for game night. It has a creative theme and I'd like to play it again. Too bad it requires a lot of people (5+), which will extend the play time. 

Also, player elimination is a big problem, but can be remedied by playing a variant where dead players have a role. I can see this game being fun when everyone knows the rules and they're very quick to act. Otherwise, especially with the confusion of new players, it may drag on and many won't enjoy it.

Perhaps fun for what it is: a family game.  Strategists, move on. The roles don't work properly, so what ought to be a great part of the game gets all screwy, with only the Renegade being truly interesting to play (but having almost no chance to win). 

Most damning, the icons are horrible to explain, rendering it difficult for exactly the audience it's intended for. I'm amazed people have greeted this so warmly.

Well it finally happened "my dwarves fly"  may have been over taken as my fave card game! This game is fun! The very first time my regular group played it everyone reluctantly agreed to play one game afore everyone went home, 5 games later and gone midnight everyone eventually went. It plays like a more complicated werewolf with combat with ooddles of theme, jolly good raucous fun, easy to pick up would make a very good entry level game

Bang! always gets tons of laughs and plays really well with non-gamers.  My biggest complaint is that without aggressive players, the game can really drag, but aggressive players are usually penalized by being knocked out early.  Elimination is a bummer.  But despite this, it's still fun and it's usefulness with large groups and with non-gamers makes it a definite winner.

Enjoyable party game - but make sure you're anticipating player elimination,  since that's that point of the game.  In large groups,  it's easy to have someone eliminated if he's ganged up upon.  Fairly quick game,  but even so, feels a touch long.  It's all about "Take That!"  mechanisms here, so be forewarned.

Really, there are way too many special cases - what's the point of icons when almost every card has a different one?

Suitable social game. As an interesting note, I've 4 times played the sheriff in this game, and all 4 times I killed everyone at the table, including my own deputies. I mean that, every single killing shot came from me that put a person out of the game. It's not supposed to be done that way guys, you're supposed to keep your deputies alive! Ooooops. There's a lot of silly banter for this game, from the usual 'I shot the sheriff', and 'I didn't kill the deputy' to 'I fought the law and the law won', not to mention of course other spin offs of songs and little puns. No game of Bang! can escape them.

:trash:Divertidísimo juego de cartas basado en el Salvaje Oeste. Tiene su tensión y emoción, y te lo pasas genial. Risas aseguradas. La pega es que a veces la duración de la partida se "dispara", la eliminación de los personajes (que les toca esperar a la siguiente partida) y que el mínimo de jugadores es 4, pero se disfruta mejor con 5 o 6. Por lo general, un juego rápido.

My chief complaint with this game is with people who over analyze things and take forever to take their turns.  For me this is a quick shoot em' up western game, that creates situations based on who is who (like werewolves of miller's hallow for example).  While there certainly is a strategy in playing cards, due to the random nature of what you draw, strategy doesn't play as much of a role as luck.  So that being said if I'm playing with folks that understand that, and make the most of the roles and characters its a pretty fun game.

This is a really fun quick game.  Everyone loves the theme, although lots of people don't get the range.  I personnaly think its dead easy, you just read the card and do what it says.  However most people are lazy.  Not really worth playing with four.

This card game recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal. The Outlaws hunt the Sheriff. The Sheriff hunts the Outlaws. The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other.

A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. BANG! cards let you shoot at another player assuming the target is within "range" of your current gun.

Fun for a while, but quickly loses its lustre when you're elinimated from the game without ever playing a card. Incredibly random and yet the rules are a little tricky, so it's more complex than it needs to be for a family game while only really working as a party game.

Leuke filler die de nodige lachsalvo's met zich meebrengt.

In dit spel vechten de sterke arm der wet (sheriff met zijn deputies) en de bandieten tegen elkaar om controle over het wilde westen. Maar misschien bevind er zich ook nog een derde partij in het spel!

Ieders rol is geheim, maar gedurende het spel wordt dit wel langzaam duidelijk. Last men standing wint.

although i like the game and the idea, my first game was with the recommended 7 players...i found it very slow and difficult to get people to make there move to . The trouble with the game I think is that the icons aren't that intuitive, so players who do not know the game that well are a little lost as to what does what. I'm sure it's all fine if you play the game regularly, but I think sabateur might be the better bet.

Try being jailed a couple games in a row and see how fun that it.  I will maybe try it with a different crowd to see if it gets any better...  When I play a game like this one or even settlers, I think about how everyone has different tastes.  Many will really like this game, and I can actually see why, but for me, I would rather play a hundred other games before sitting through this one again.

I don't like the games in which if you lost you are out of the game and you are waiting bored for several minutes until the next game begins. And this is that kind of game. But maybe I could give it another opportunity with more players.

RATING: 9
A brilliant little card game, mixing luck, skill and good sense.  Great for people who don't play Eurogames all that often, it's quick and easy to learn and people *always* want another go!

Under my three standard categories:
Complexity scores about 1.5 out of 5; for reference, this puts it between TransAmerica and Settlers.
Choice scores 2 out of 5; there is a lot of chance in the draw of the cards.  However, there is skill needed, too.
Conversation hits the high 5; this game is all about the opposition and really encourages the players to interact.

RATING: 7
Simple game that is perfect for casual game nights with friends. Best with maximum number of players: the more you are the best time you'll have believe me! There's a little social deduction aspect to the game that I really enjoy. The only problem of this game, in my opinion, is that if you die early on, you are done! You are out of the game until the very end...

What a fun one this is.  Secret roles and character abilities.  You kind of have to play this with the right people otherwise it may be dull.

The 1st 2 or 3 games I played of this I was the first to die.  And in 2 of those cases I died before I even got a turn.

It may be a very lucky game and the symbols may be very confusing but I like it.

Update: 05/19/08 - 7.5=>7 Still like it but I've passed it up a few times to play games I like more.  Sometimes the game doesn't present you with many options and the player elimination is a little annoying.  

Need to play with the Dead Man's Hand poker variant.

A fun filler for a larger group. Though it is possible for someone to be eliminated fairly early in the proceedings, the game is usually short enough for that not to present much of a problem.

This game went over well with our group. Played twice with 5 players. My only complaint is that it was pretty obvious what role each player was.

Will play with 7 on Christmas, and I'm hoping for the deduction element to show itself. Having said that, I'm worried that the game will drag.

The theme is great, however, and that's a plus for me.

UPDATE: Played with 7. It was a lot of fun. only deputy ended up killing another deputy. My one and only complaint with the game is that is it hard to teach. It's amazing how complicated the cards are for a simple, party game.

UPDATE: Dropping the rating from a 8 to a 6. So much of this game depends on seating arrangement and special powers. In the 6-7 player games, someone will undoubtedly be eliminated within the first 2-3 rounds. While I would never hate a game because of luck elements, there does seem to be a fair amount of predetermination after the roles are passed out. Oh well. Everyone always has a good time. 

UPDATE: Going down to a 5 because Bang! The Dice Game is so much better. Don't buy this game! Buy the dice version!

Player elimination really sucks in a game that takes as long as this one does.  Played as Willy the Kid and was killed immediately in the first few rounds because I sat next to the sheriff.  I was actually one of the good guys (deputy) and then I sat around for over 2 hours watching re-runs of Everybody loves Raymond until they finished the game.  What a night.

Some fun mechanics (such as "distance" being a factor). However, it needs several players to work well, otherwise the renegade is discovered too early and killed. Also, in bigger games, people killed early are out of the game and left with nothing much to do...

RATING: 6
This game got a VERY mixed response in our group. It was NOT liked by people who don't want too much randomness. I thought it was fine and was happy just to enjoy the theme and laugh at the things that were happening (including getting killed after giving away stupidly that I was the renegade). What was interesting though was the amount of post-game analytical conversation that took place about who did what to whom and how that gave them away. I will happily play it again but need to find players who're happy to play a high-luck / low-skill game.

Bang! is a very enjoyable game, although it does have two (minor) problems. One is that players can be knocked out of the game, which is not something I tend to like. The other is that this game often goes on way longer than the time to play advertised on the box. Having said all that, there are variants on BGG to deal with the former problem and the latter isn't really a problem if you know that you're probably going to be playing it for a lot more than 20 minutes.

Easy to learn, fun to play. Fast and furious action, where folks really get into shouting out BANG! every time they take a pot shot. A party game masquerading as a card game. My opinion is dropping quickly, though, based on some insanely long games where players perform seemingly random moves with no thought to the goals, or take exceedingly long amounts of time to play a card or two. This game should have a brisk pace and play in 30 minutes or so, otherwise, it's far too long and far too repetitive.

Super dependent on who you're playing with and how many people are playing.  I also feel like the beginning of the game has no real strategy; you can tell everyone you're good or bad till you're blue in the face, but inevitably it comes down to people randomly shooting at each other and not having much of a strategy until the end.  Also, the game can last a long time once people have been kicked out leaving players just waiting for it to end.  This happened to me as I was killed the first round when teaching the game because "I had an advantage playing the game" and had to wait and explain the game for 45 minutes until it ended.

Fun with larger groups, nice quick (sometimes) filler to scratch a two-player itch, but lacks the same depth.

I do think the rules need to be written more clearly.

I also have to agree with the people who argue that this one can drag on.

Rating after first play which was quite a disappointment. Nice game, but I was expecting so much more. I'll be back after couple of games more.

Now after couple of games with 5 players this was a huge success. This was the hilarious fun fast game of backstabbing I was looking for. We also started using Dodge City.

tip: never ever play with fewer than 5 players.

I have endured games of this where I've been killed without playing a card.

Not to my taste.

Genial! Requires 2 or 3 games to play speed and learn the cards. My opinion is that players must play fast or can be boring ..

Just eh. I don't really care for the theme and the gameplay is only somewhat compelling. fistful of cards and high noon makes it a lot better though since they up the randomness. I appreciate it in this context because it keeps what would become stale fast fresh longer.

The game is good, though a little too long for what it is. And it's such a pain to have to look in the book to know what some of the cards do.

After 2 Plays: This is the most out and out fun I've had playing a game since [gameid=112].  This can drag a little if people are playing very defensively, which will lessen the fun.

RATING: 7
A quick and enjoyable filler. It seemed odd to me why the bandits would shoot anyone but the sheriff, but from what I was told the game is more sneaky with 5 or more people playing. I have a feeling that the renegade and possibly the sheriff are more fun to play than bandits because there is more strategy involved in what they do.

I love this kind of game. Fast, funny, and you're supposed to take a role. Being the sheriff and still fire away without question is hilarious.

For as light as it is, I wish it were easier to explain. As is, there are lots of unique cards and icons which befuddle newbies. This is the drawback of a bilingual edition.

RATING: 7
Fast paced card game. Classic game night filler between longer, more strategic games. Easy to teach and learn. Little bit of hidden identity in the mechanics, but not enough to require extensive bluffing or deception, which I find to be an uncomfortable game mechanic, honestly.

RATING: 8
First play dragged out to about 90 minutes because of players overthinking the game.  Thought the issue might be the game.  Played again with a different group and we played 40 games in 90 minutes.  Signifigantly better.  Good game, just make sure your group doesn't take it too seriously.

Initial play was taught by someone who had no idea how to the game, I think every play had at least 2-3 errors in it.

A quick look through the rules shows me a totally different game.

it needs at least 5 players to give the best.

One of the best card games for bigger groups. Player elimination is perhaps the only problem if the game drags on and on but aggressive play helps shorten it ;)

Feels a little broken, and I have trouble with games that knock people out and force them to sit and watch the remainder.  Did like the targeting system involving how many seats away one was sitting, but common items quickly made that unusable too.

A very disappointing professional version of the game "Mafia," which is played with simple deck of cards.  What's more, "Mafia" is infintely more enjoyable and is playable up to 12 people.

There are a lot of paths to victory that a player can explore, and every route you take is adventurous. You can try to focus on one strategy, or you can mix and match, but you can never do everything you want, and that's the beauty of it that will draw you to play it again. Variable setup introduces great replay value. The downside is that you have to play it multiple times to fully grasp the game since it is not as straightforward as it seems once you are familiar with the game.

Quick playing game that's intuitive but has depth about running cattle from Texas to Kansas City (and beyond).  

The game is variable in length, scales well from 2-4 players, and has fast turns. Each turn you move, and it's point to point movement from building to building (thus movement typically slows down later in the game when more buildings are out), and then utilize a buildings power(s). There are neutral buildings, which are laid out at the start of the game and provide significant variability depending on the order that they come out, and personal buildings which first need to be built and can only be used by their owner. You start with a hand of 4 cattle cards (all players have the same starting deck but due to shuffling/drawing and deck building and thinning, hands will vary) and many building actions allow for card play. You always refill your hand at the end of your turn. 

Your goal is to score the most points by game end and there are several ways to score (point salad): 1) buying new cow cards, 2) building personal buildings, 3) making cattle deliveries, 4) scoring end game objective cards, 5) clearing hazards, 6) building train stations, 7) having a large supply of assistants (cowboys, builders, engineers), 8) some other minor ways such as cash in hand, etc. You are following a trail to Kansas City which has branch points but eventually you will reach your destination at which point you must make a delivery. This typically has several benefits: you get cash in hand (very useful), you place a disk on a station (can provide end game points) and the disk that was placed comes from your personal action board which opens up improved actions. This upgrade effect comes in two flavours either improved actions such as more movement or larger hand size, or improved auxiliary actions; auxiliary actions are minor but important actions you can take at certain buildings or at any movement endpoint instead of doing a building action. 

Each delivery involves seeding a track of hired personalities which serves as a supply to buy from but which is also a game clock; the more frequent the deliveries, the faster the game. Personalities play a significant role as they boost your abilities in three key areas: 1) cowboys allow for cheaper prices when buying cattle cards, 2) builders allow for more powerful and higher point value buildings, and 3) engineers improve the movement of your train (you want to move your train as it reduces the freight costs of delivering cattle to far away destinations and it opens up train station building opportunities). As well personalities provide one off bonuses if you collect enough of the same type and score end game points if you acquire enough of them. 

This is a fun easy to play gamers game with significant variability and is a great follow up to Pfisters' previous design Mombasa.  Looking forward to more releases from this designer.

Lots of stuff to do. You can plan several moves forward or better play current turn the way it fits your general strategy best. Building provide nice player interaction, other parts not so much. Visually very nice, warm summer colors. Negatives: setup time, no bags for 1-2-3 tokerns (try to find and add these), rules are hard to search for and reference.

Undoubtedly a great game, but not likely to become one of my favorites. The good: multiple viable strategies, theme works nicely with the game, a fun acceleration toward the end of the game as everyone rushes to sell. The cons: hard to care about what other players are doing (not that this is unusual for a euro), you can see who the winner will be many turns before the end, complex symbology makes it tough to teach to new players & opens up opportunities for misunderstandings although the game itself is really not very complex.  I have no doubt that this will be someone's favorite game, and I'd play it again, but I don't think I'll want to own it.

RATING: 8
7 plays / 2,3,4 players (4p = 3.5h)

LIKE: Mild interaction, good strategy. It's possible to mess with your opponents by adding obstacles in the worker paths. Lots to think about, balancing ways to get an engine going. The worker buildings, where to place them, how to maneuver your workers each pass, was simply brilliant.

DISLIKE: Lots of rules, some easy to forget. Theme is not attached to the mechanisms, especially deck building with cows. I felt the deck building/shuffling was a little overkill, and introduces a random element.

OVERALL: Very good game. It's a point salad and a mechanism salad, but it works and I like it. Compared to Mombasa (Pfister's other design), they are equally fun, but I like the theme a tad better in this one (cow cards vs. pith helmets).

RATING: 6
I had a bad experience with this game.  Set up and rules explanation was well over half an hour, and the game took more than four hours total.  There were some positives and I'd like to give it another try, but I found the game to be an athematic kitchen sink design that didn't do much for me.

Finally had a second play.  Went much smoother, but I think it is still a 6 for me.  It was fun for the first half, but it felt repetitive and started to drag by the end.  Also, the random draws of the cattle seem out of place in an effiency/optmization Euro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
One of the better Euro's I've played in a very long time indeed. And a welcome one! The theme is fresh here and the mechanics are very smooth. Not since Russian Railroads have I felt a game that ran as easily and was as well polished with loads of variable scoring paths. Extremely well done in every regard. Love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There seems to be multiple ways to victory in Great Western Trail, none of which feels overly dominant which I take as a sing of a good game. Every action seems significant although not decisive. The only things that seem like a must, are getting those extra hand cards as early as possible and increasing your movement speed early enough so that you can avoid being caught in the web of buildings other players are laying down.

I must admit that the game can feel a bit repetitive since the only thing that changes is that you get more and more money every round from shipping your cattle. Luckily the game progresses at a decent pace so that it does not become too tedious.

Easier access to gameplay than in Mombasa. Action taking quite fast After understanding rules, icons and core mechanismn. Lots of different victory point strategies possible.

Upgrading my rating after my 2nd full play. This is a truly engaging game and how refreshing that it's long and interesting throughout! Having played two very different tactics and watched my friends doing the same, it is clear that the game is very well balanced and the fact that it is so variable each play makes it a very worthwhile purchase.

An excellent euro!  I really like how the game develops during play.  It starts out very sparse and open, narrowing as more actions are taken, until its form comes together, built by the players responding to the random elements (card draws, worker & hazard draws).  It's fun to play and I'm very glad I picked it up.

RATING: 6
1st play: Excellent blend of route building (sortof), deck building, and engine building. Approaching each game you can focus on your deck, your workers, or your engineering, but it's hard to do all things at once. Deck building for cows is really unique and fits the theme well. The game runs a little long, but I'm not exactly sure how it would be shortened. The symbols are good and we didn't have to refer to the rules at all in our play which is a great sign. Nice to see a western themed game without high-noon shootouts.

2nd play: Great second play, I managed to get the flow of the game and placed my buildings a lot better to synch with my strategy. The goals each game are roughly the same, so I'm not sure how much variability there is. There's an interesting optimization goal with each play, but it would be easy to see more buildings in an expansion.

RATING: 10
I already enjoyed learning other game from Alexander Pfister this year, Mombasa, and I though I would like this almost same complexity game. And I liked it even more than Mombasa, the reason is that I think things are more organic in this game, the interaction between players and between the lots of stuff you need to take care and the correlation between them.

It is a brilliant design that have a lot of cool mechanics into a very cool game. And the theme, in spite of being pasted, makes even more sense than Mombasa does.

Another thing that I liked is that there are a lot of paths for victory, a lot of strategies and a feeling that you are still playing and giving your best even when knowing you cannot win anymore, that feeling is great for a game that is supposed to be fun for everyone.

Highly recommended.

Surprisingly easy to pick up and learn. It has some novel mechanics in play. The theme is a bit of a bore, but unexpectedly I found myself immersed in it after a few rounds without realizing. I might increase my score after a few plays if I can see the effectiveness of alternative strategies at work with more players.

A very good game of multi-player solitaire that could be just as good (if not better) if Herr Pfister had slimmed the mechanics considerably, or included some useful player aids (a need for which the game is crying out). Looks nice, but there is not even a hint of theme in this one: those users who say it's well-themed would apparently find Chess well-themed!

Solid, solid effort from Pfister. I think Mombasa is the better game, but this is very enjoyable too. I am still, however, convinced that the luck of the draw with cowboys can take someone out of the running. You don't need a lot of them to win, but you probably need a few.

Unpleasantly surprised with this game, though perhaps playing with four is peculiarly bad?   First, did I feel like I was thematically doing anything other than playing around with tired euro mechanics over and over again?  Nope.  And no way was I driving a herd of cattle, as the game was trying to invite me to believe.  

Instead, I felt like I was drawing cards, again and again, moving a few spaces on a board, and buying cards to build a deck, or buying buildings to put on the board, or doing things that gave me victory points, or made it easier for me to earn victory points.  I was not interacting at all with the other players, and as such, the gaming experience was dry and isolating.  Are we even in the same room playing a game?  Boring!  Then again, I tend to find this to be a problem in a lot of deck building games.

This game evidently represents a trend in euro design that simply puts together interlocking basic or standard euro mechanics, with little attention to theme, and entices euro gamers into trying to optimize the distinctive tangle of this particular euro mechanics collection.  If the mechanics are fresh, fun, interactive, it can work for me.  Here, the tangle felt stale, dull and isolating, not to mention tenuously themed.

In general, I am no longer a fan of games where you move round and round a board, again and again, over the course of several hours (sorry Monopoly and Parcheesi, my childhood friends).  I think I can tolerate this mechanic if the game is short, but here, the circular pony ride felt long, too long pardner, interminably long.

RATING: 6
Great Western Trail is somewhat of a disappointing game. Luck of the draw and tokens can play a big part in gameplay, way bigger than it should in game of this weight and length. The theme is really not there at all, it's a mix match of different mechanism and scoring is a point salad of many mostly unrelated things. I also fail to see the fun in the samey rinse and repeat travel that should be the thematic core of the game. The art is bland (cow art is nice though), but components are of good quality. Replayability is good because the map, cards and tokens are never the same, but it's hard to see this one returning to the table too often because of the lack of fun and bad luck/weight ratio.

Fun factor: 2/5
Strategy vs. luck: 3/5

Boy, this one is a stinker to learn from the rulebook. Took us like 75 minutes to read through it cold. Then maybe 3 hours for the first 4P play. And the thing is, the rules aren't particularly hard, there are just a lot of them. The game itself is a neat little loop engine, where you're going through both the board and your deck over and over while attempting to make each pass better for you. Overall, I liked it. Would recommend having someone teach it. Would also note that me and one of those other new players later RIPPED thru a 2P game in like 45m.

Un juego excelente!!

Reglas no complicadas una vez están digeridas y aprehendidas. Y sobre todo diversión sin grandes dosis de puteo. múltiples posibilidades de conseguir puntuaciones y rápido de jugar.
Cada partida es distinta a la anterior gracias a la combinación de dos cuestiones:

- las edificaciones predefinidos del tableo se colocan aleatoriamente.
- los edificios de los jugadores solo se pueden construir por una de las dos caras aleatoriaz que se selecciona al principio de la partida.

Cada partida, gracias a la combinación de estas dos aleatoridades es dferente y por eso no hay una estrategia definida que funcione con todas las combinaciones.  

Mezcla de creación de mazo, construcción de edificios, creación de combos... puteo indircto alrestode jugadores y turnos cortos que agradeceb sacarlo a mesa.

La temática es accesoria en los euros pero de tan amable que es, con nuevas vaquitas, granjeros,y edificaciones, trenes de por medio, track de puntuación con jefes de estación que bonifican, en fin, que es todo tan bonito que disfruto creando edifciios, contaratando trabajadores o avanzando mi tren por EEUU. de verdad que es de los pocos euros que me meten el tema.

Toda una sorpresa del 2016 que gracias a Carlos y a Coco conozco y difruto. Lo menos han caído 15 partidas y sigo queriendo volverlo a jugar. me faltan maneras de ver la victoria!!!!!

My god do I Love this game.  It just lands right in my wheel-house.  It was quite a year for Stronghold Games with this one AND Terraforming Mars.  It seems like most people seemed to favor the later, but I am solidly in the GWT camp.  I think it's a more compelling game (and a prettier one to boot)  I love the hand/deck management aspect with the cattle and how the board changes based on how players build out the trail.

Lots of ways to win, lots of things to try.  So so good.

Ritka, hogy ennyire szarul megy egy játék (2 parti alapján írom) és mégis ennyire tetszik. Nagyon jól össze van rakva a szabály (vagy csak nagyon jól mondták, mert én nem olvastam), kevés kérdés merült fel közben, ráadásul a bonyolultsági szinthez képest gyorsan el is mondható. A játék nagyon sokutasnak tűnt elsőre, de azért vannak dolgok, amikre nagy eséllyel rá kell menni, a mi két partink alapján a pakli karcsúsítása mindenképp ilyennek tűnik. Nagyon tetszik, hogy magunknak ütemezhetjük a játék ritmusát. Végigrohanhatunk a pályán, de akár megállhatunk minden akciónál, függetlenül attól, a többiek hogy tesznek. Ez persze a játék hosszára is kihat, szerintem ha mindenki keveset lép, akár többszöröse is lehet a játékidő (és a pontszámok). Nekünk meglepően gyorsan lementek a partik, 3 fővel volt 3 ill. 2 óra. Nekem túl rövid is volt a 2 órás, nem tudtam kibontakozni:) A vége nagyon izgalmas, amikor már látszik, hogy nagyjából 3-4 akciónk van, de pontosan még nem tudjuk, mennyi. Persze ha az ember rosszul alapozta meg a játékát, akkor a vége szenvedős. A végén egyik partiban már csak bekkeltem, hogy véletlenül se érjek körbe, mert ott várt a minusz pont. Apropó minusz pont: volt egyszer, hogy nüanszon múlt, hogy 12 helyett csak 11 érték jött össze a kör végére, ezen 11 pontot buktam, ezt soknak éreztem, de ez legyen az én bajom. Túl gyorsan rohangáltam körbe, és nem volt elég jó a paklim. Utólag ez kamikaze taktikának bizonyult:) A játék szerencsére hülyebiztos, mert a -6 pont mellé ad 6 pénzt, amivel elindulhatunk a következő körben.
Összességében egy nagyon jó játékról beszélünk, bár nekem nem top10 szint azért, utána azt mondtam, hogy nekem ez Marco Polo szint volt. Nem is túl hosszú, szóval aki a középnehéz eurókat szereti, az feltétlen próbálja ki. Bár a cím (főleg a magyar) kicsit megtévesztő, de én még tematikát is kiéreztem belőle, és küllemre is tetszett. Összességében bármikor katagória, csak azért nem veszem meg, mert itthon mostanában esélytelennek érzem. Bár mint megtudtam, már ennek is van szóló variánsa.

It may never be a school-night game for us, and I'm still a little ticked off with the lack of player aides, but our persistence paid off and we had a fun, tense game. At first I thought that the sheer amount of stuff was hiding what could have been a simple game, but our second game proved that there are many useful choices, all of which work together very well.

Mr. Alexander Pfister is definitely the most inspired games designer of these last few years: with Great Western Trail he scores another sound hit, after the lighter Isle of a Skye and the similarly heavy Mombasa.

GWT is cumbersome to teach, but surprisingly smooth to play: after a couple of turns in the first game, everything falls into place. But it will disclose its secrets and delights, in form of nuances and strategies, well after many plays.
Here, the deckbuilding aspect is just a gear among many others, in a jaw dropping clockwork with many moving parts, many different approaches and many ways to subtly influence other players...

It was a while since I've been so impressed by a german game. This one deserves an 8, but the rating will possibly go up after some more plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impression: I usually enjoy games more when they convey a strong sense of theme and the Western theme in particular is a personal favorite of mine. To my surprise, this game's theme didn't really shine through for me. However, I found that this didn't bother me so much, as the gameplay was fun. With the many paths to victory, do you build lots of buildings? Do you drive as many cattle as quickly as you can to the market? Do you concentrate on train stations? There's a definite sense that you need to do everything but simply don't have enough time in which to do it. Player interaction was fairly minimal but I actually didn't miss it. When the game was over, I immediately had the desire to play again in order to explore different options. This is the mark of a great game.

Great Western Trail (GWT) is a mash-up of a number of mechanisms. It doesn't feel as smoothly mixed as some others that I rate highly, such as Troyes and Ginkgopolis. However, this game provides more grand strategy than those games. 

I found that the first few plays of GWT felt more ponderous than Brass. That's largely due to the amount of iconography and lack of player aids (which I've since printed off BGG for use by new players). Once this has been played enough to internalize the icons, this plays quite quickly. GWT's setup and chit draws provide a welcome dose of variability from play to play. The initial difficulty in getting used to GWT is outweighed by what it becomes: a fast playing, deep strategy game that plays well at 2-4 and that requires some tactical play to succeed. 

Another of GWT's strengths is that it allows the players to choose the pace of the game. Want a slow game? Take your time to Kansas City. Want a faster game? Rush to Kansas City. One player rushing to Kansas City? Throw a bunch of buildings on the trail. Players trying to slow you down? Increase your movement or throw down a few specific buildings that give you free movement.

I do wish there was a bit more connection between its theme and its mechanisms. Other euro-style games I've rated highly, such as Vinhos and Troyes, feel more thematic. I think the disconnect is kind of due to the inaccurate representation of the true "Great Western Trail" that the game puts in front of you. Non-luck purists might be turned off to the "luck of the draw" in this game, but there are mechanisms to combat that aspect and that is one of the ways in which the game builds inefficiencies into a player's default engine.

Grootste populariteit in Essen 2016.
Eerste speelmoment geeft me goed gevoel:  Er zijn verschillende manieren om naar de overwinning te klimmen.  Ieder speelt wat op zichzelf, maar dat stoort niet.
De uitleg duurt even, maar eens je aan het spelen bent, wijst alles zichzelf uit.
Je kan ook geen zware fouten maken in de eerste paar rondes.  Ik zie wel dat het belangrijk is om goed te kijken waar je je huizen zet.  Zorg ervoor dat je soms 2 huizen kan gebruiken.
De trein is een speciaal element.  Evenwicht zoeken tussen niet te snel en niet te traag gaan.  Zorg dat je op het einde beter 2 steden naast elkaar hebt...

UPDATE: [1.15.17]
I got to log my first "nearly full" play of Great Western Trail.
2P game.

Has anyone else played GWT?
Thoughts?

Sarah (my wife) and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  
The game turn is simple:

1) Move your cowdude up to his allotted number of spaces.
2) Perform any actions permitted at the building/outpost where you have landed.
3) Make sure your "hand" (the cattle you are driving to Kansas City is back to the "herd" limit)

Things to manage in the game (which makes for the interest and fun)

1) Type of cattle you are bringing to Kansas City.  Only unique cattle will be sold!  So off loading duplicate cows on the "trail" and picking up new ones via outposts, or the cattle market is one set of variables that needs to be managed.  Round em' up.  Head 'em out -- RAWHIDE!

2) Moving your train.  Once cattle have been delivered to Kansas City, you may deliver the cattle along your railway.  The farther your locomotive is down the track, the further West you can deliver your cattle (and also NOT have to pay for intervening whistle stops that eat up your profit just made by selling the cattle).  Also beware, if you deliver cattle to two "neighboring" cities, you will have to take the penalty or bonus that lies in between the two cities (e.g. -3 VP's or -1 VP and draw an objective card, etc.)

3) Building and placing buildings/outposts along the trail.  Newly placed buildings only help the player who placed the building, if they land on it in a subsequent turn.  However, opposing players may have to pay a "tax" for passing through or landing on the hostile building.  So there is a progressive set of "toll booths" that can be set up along the trail.  Understanding where to place these building for your max. benefit and your opponents max. pain is another dimension this game offers.  Build wisely.

4) Managing your money.  Players need to understand how much money the will likely need to fully maximize their effectiveness as they move from Texas to Kansas City.  Being a dollar short here or there may lead to diminished returns anywhere along the trail.  

5) Hiring workers.  There are 3 types.  Cowboys (help get you discounts at the cattle market); Conductors (help you gain bonuses with your locomotive); and Craftsman (help you build better buildings).  Knowing how much to spend on which worker, and how many of each type is something your ranch's HR dept. needs to figure out in order to be effective.

There is a ton to explore in this game, and I'm sure it only gets more cut throat when the player count goes up.

I'm not happy that eurogames are encroaching on ameritrash territory with their fancy, balanced rules and their wonderfully produced components.  This one has won me over though.  Just quality.

This game has the best implementation of a rondel mechanics that I've played. The whole board is essentially a giant rondel with multiple actions you can perform. This game is rather unique, it blends a lot of different elements together for a Euro game, there's objectives to be fulfilled, race in the engine track, set collection, deck building and overall a thematic point salad. 

This game grew on me with repeated plays, there's new strategies to discover each time I play and I'm looking forward to explore further.

First Play: Had rules explained and it came across as considerably more involved that I'd anticipated. Certainly more involved and fiddly than Mombasa. It didn't help that I made two huge mistakes throughout the entire game which helped and hindered me in equal measure. It is crucial that at least one person is very well versed in the rules and willing to supervise each turn until all players have their feet securely in the stirrups.

This game borrows very heavily from Caylus and Russian Railroads. I'm surprised that most reviewers so far haven't felt the need to mention this. Those well versed in deck builder games will have a head start. First game is a big step to file and sort the icons. Need to play again but at this stage not as impressed as I was with Mombasa.

RATING: 7.5
A hodge-podge of Euro mechanics that blend pretty nicely. There is technically a theme here that you're a cattle driver trying to deliver cattle to Kansas City and get them on trains. You have a hand of cards that represent your cattle and along the trail you are making stops trying to make money/get more cattle/hire workers/etc. None of it really fits thematically as it's likely most of the cattle you end up delivering weren't even the cattle you started with. The timer/worker track is clunky and very fiddly. Starting player order feels important and the randomness of the deck draws can be a not-insignificant factor in what is a 2+ hour game with 4p. There's three general point-generating strategies that correspond to the worker types (buying cows, buying buildings, and train-route points). It feels like the building strategy really just supports the other two and isn't viable on it's own but I could be wrong. In the end, if you get past the lack of theme and other minor negatives, this is still a very solid Euro game that gets my brain thinking pretty hard. This isn't a game I need to own myself but I'm happy to play if given the opportunity. 

Update (8/2017): 7 => 7.5
A minor bump up after my third play. We weren't playing a couple rules correctly in my first two plays, one of which was people can start anywhere on the trail they want and don't have to start at the beginning. This definitely helps the starting player order problem I had. I also just know at this point I am not very good at the game which I know isn't helping my opinion of it. =) This game is definitely a quality game and I can see why other people love it but it doesn't soar as high for me. My 7.5 rating plants this game firmly in the realm of "I probably won't suggest it but would happily play it given the chance."

It is interesting the way that this game has developed in our game group. 

We initially thought that the "cowboy" strategy was very strong, but it has been proven with subsequent games that going with engineers and builders is just as strong. There is no broken or "one way to go" strategy as far as we have experienced and the game seems very well balanced. 

There are a lot of nuances and subtleties going on in this game that the first few games don't disclose. The pace that you maintain, the obstacles put forth to other players via buildings/hazards and just trying different means to get your economy going are some of the things that keep you engaged and entertained. 

Replayability galore!

If you have a heavier game group that enjoys the challenge of figuring out different opaque avenues for victory; you can't go wrong with this title.

Great Western Trail is a game where you herd your cattle from Texas to Kansas City and deliver them by train out west. Now, if that theme doesn't get you excited about a board game, I don't know what will. Seriously, it is a theme I haven't seen before and I've always been way more interested in game play and how the game captures whatever theme is used than just the theme itself. This game is a massive cornucopia of mechanics. There is deck-building, hand management, building (tile placement), movement, special abilities and planning for end game goals. The rules take quite a bit to get through and to absorb, but like just about every game I play... it was easy to get once we were through a few rounds. At first, it felt like too much of a mish-mash and kind of a mess to make sense of. The more we played, the clearer it became and I jave a feel for how the game works and different ways to score points. I look forward to playing this one again.

Typically modern (status 2016) Medium Euro Game. A lot of different mechanisms which exist side by side but are not really interlocked. Komplexity is generated by complex rules, not by tough decisions. 10 years back, this would have been good, now it is mediocre.

Playing for the first time was very daunting, as the game is super wide open from the start.  So many options and strategies to pursue and the game only points you in one direction - toward Kansas City.  Understanding comes quickly after the first round, but additional buildings/spots keep getting added to the board, increasing the amount of choices AND the potential for each subsequent round to take that much longer to complete.  I don't usually care for deck building, but it was a quite enjoyable part of this game.  Enjoyable theme that works.

Second play = a 4p game & clearer expectations.  Much better score the second time around.  Still didn't get the chance to explore the benefits of the more expensive buildings.  Could be due a severe lack of craftsman during the first half of the game.  Still... it seems like a weaker strategy for achieving points/abilities.  Can't wait until the next play!  Excellence in game design.

After 8 plays it is starting to feel a bit repetitive, even with variable starting board setup.  I will wait for expansion details/review to decide its fate.

Update: After 6 games, bumping from 8-->9. After the first couple games, certain tracks seem OP (cowboys/cows), but on repeated play, the variety of options and subtle player interaction really shine. Could maybe be a 10 if I could get 4 players to play in the same time it normally takes to play 3p.

What's better than Choose Your Own Adventure? Choose Your Own Rondel! Interesting take on worker placement, in that it's a roll and move minus the roll. And with forks in the path, you choose how you move through the path, with each space offering stuff to do. In general you can plan a move or two ahead, and the spaces are unique enough that each space where you could stop is an important decision for whether to stop or not. There's tension in that generally all the main spots are good (except spots built by other players), but you also want to generally move briskly to cycle the circuit as often as possible. By cycling too fast without accomplishing much creates its own problems, because every time you cycle, you need to sell cows and score them, and with a fixed number of scoring options that each player can only use once each, you can only sell a low-value set of cattle a couple times before it becomes a big problem. As any good euro, there are multiple axes of progress, and you want to develop them all, but can never do as much as you want. Oh, and tell your xx friends it's a train game! Sort of.

First play: Seemed interesting, but concerns over both the deck-building in a longish game, and the length itself. It's one of those games that despite concerns, I found myself thinking about after playing it. Both issues faded on 2nd play. I'm now looking forward to more.

What is it that draws hordes of gamers to this type / style of game? That was the question my gaming friend and I asked ourselves after having wrestled through the rule book plus a quick verbal explanation, and a number of sample rounds. Our answer was inconclusive at best. Gamers simply [i]do[/i], for unfathomable reasons.

Well, not entirely unfathomable. Gamers tend to want 'lots of stuff', and they get it by the herdload in GWT. A gazillion little actions await the brave cowboys who begin driving ever growing cattle herds—a little bit in deckbuilding / deckthinning-style—towards Kansas City. Of course any charm of the subject matter is lost in this icon tornado. Not that it bothers me personally as the subject is the first thing out the window whenever I play a game, but still. If you want to, you can easily lose yourself in layer upon layer of deliberations; and there will be very little cowboy charm to these. 

In my short, mangled experience three things stood out as particularly irksome. One is that the game does not keep a running score. You play, and play, and play... and only at the end will you find out how much VPs your strategy netted you and the others, exactly. This is inexcusable in a game of this length. There's bound to be the usual defense that it prevents AP and hitting on the leader, as if those are Bad Things which need to be avoided. It is a game, there is competition, and someone will win. Competition is difficult, and annoying, but it leads to memorable sessions. It tells me something else about the population of gamers who pushed this title into the upper regions of BGG's ranking list, flawed as that is: namely that they don't really mind playing for its own sake, and not to win. It probably isn't hard to keep a running score (or an approximation of it) but the fact that this isn't included in the core rules is 'no'.

The second is that, obviously, gamers are turned into little optimising human computers. The is a tonne of little rules to absorb; eleven (!) sources of VP to take into consideration (granted, not all of them are equally important); optimising substrategy A vs. B vs. C vs. ... . Whatever happened to lean & mean? This game rewards playing more often. Clearly so. Why not do away with half to three quarters of this convoluted mess and end up with a title which too rewards playing more often, but then in a nimble and responsive setting, taking up far less table space to boot? It doesn't make any sense. Unless of course today's crop of gamers equate 'game quality' with 'lots of bits' in which case GWT strikes another home run. 

The third is simply that the artwork is hopelessly overburdened to convey all the information to the players. Iconography is small and tiny, and not particularly friendly on the eyes while reading upside down. If the response now is 'well, you don't really have to read it all upside down', then I can equally wonder what the point of playing this grotesque monster is.

This game is not something I would have chosen to play based on a cursory study of the rules; I really wanted to pack up before the explanation was even halfway. As a result I'm not going to rate this title, but I'm fairly certain it would end up with a 3 at best, and most likely a 2.

I love this game! Blends different mechanics together seamlessly and there are different ways to win. We always end up standing for the final turns as you try to maximise your points. Intense game with a lot of varied decisions to make as you play. Excellent value. I'm always happy to play, can drag at higher player counts as players learn the game but that gets better after a few plays. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something deeper than you're average game.

I crushed everyone the first time. This game is too long but is really fun so I forgive it a bit.  Cool game where you are deck building over the course of the game really slowly and you are kind of honing and shaping your hand over the course of one round through the trail.  Seems to have a lot of avenues to success but doing a bit of everything could be key to success.

Might be worth exploring.

Gift for my boys and I to play. My 10 year old kicks our butts. His strategy of getting to KC as often he can and obsessing over hiring workers and buying Texas Longhorns somehow gets his engine up and cranking. Meanwhile, I and my 13 year old struggle to figure out what we should be doing while my 10 year old just plows through with whatever is going on his head.

I and my older boy enjoy Terraforming Mars more than Great Western Trail. My youngest prefers this one. 

Too many confusing icons and too many different things going on. Maybe that makes it replayable, but so far it just makes it seem like a mess of a game that I can't imagine teaching to a new gaming group. I may change my rating after more plays.

Update: nope, I'm downgrading it from 5 to 4. It just seems like a grinding, mashup of game mechanics with a theme tacked on. Buildings go unplayed, routes on the game board go untraveled. It seems like there should be a lot more interesting things happening than there are. It also seems like players should be able to progress further through developing their rail networks, their herds, their buildings, their employees, etc. before the game ends. I give it a "Meh...."

RATING: 10
This game is so pleasant to play, you feel very satisfied when progressing through Texas and ride your herd of cows to Kansas City. There is a lot to do, yet you are not overwhelmed with choices as your actions per turn are very simple - you just progress step by step to reach the goal.

What I like:
- Theme. It is stronger there than in most euro games and you really feel like the cowboy taking care of your cows. Also the mechanics in the game are well implemented to match the theme. 
- Game uses several mechanics which are interesting, fun and easy to grasp. There is your own deck of cards - your herd of cows (deckbuilding), there is also interesting rondel mechanics - the journey to the Kansas - which you progress with your pawn (point to point movement), you can build buildings to the strategic places on the track (tile placement), you try to sell as valuable herd as you can (hand management), and there is also the train track where you can build stations and hire station masters. You can also hire your own workers (cowboys, engineers and builders) which can help you whatever strategy you choose.
- You feel close to be available to do anything you want. There a lot of ways to choose, the sandbox feeling is quite there.
- Production quality is nice. It is nice look to the board and every game piece is well manufactured. The special mention goes to the game board, which is not only nice, but also well designed and it holds a lot of details.
- Although there is a lot to do, rules are very clear and you don't need to refer a rulebook after the first gamethrough. Buildings had a very understandable symbols and the rules are implemented elegantly. The rulebook is very well written - I would say it is one of the best rulebooks I have seen so far.
- There is also unofficial solo mode using automa. Very challenging but very welcomed.

What I don't like:
- my only complaint about production quality is player board. It should be made of a thicker paper at least.
- This game requires all the player to have similar skill level, there is almost no way the weaker player to beat the stronger one. There is also no catch up mechanism (at least I am not aware of anything), although it is hard to say who is winning because this is at the end the point salad game where a lot of things are counted.
- sometimes you are just very unlucky in your card draw which can lead to the weaker delivery, which hurts mostly in first three deliveries - although there are lot of ways how to build your hand during the journey. But sometimes you didn't get good hand no matter how hard you try.
- there is a lot of stuff to set up and tear down. Unless you have everything well organized, it could be pain to do it. But it is understandable as this is heavier euro.

This could be my new favorite Euro game! It's the perfect storm of deck building, a technology tree, point salad, and a modifiable rondel. The only concern I have is replayability. It should be OK, but I'm not sure how much I will enjoy playing different configurations and exploring various strategies. I enjoyed the engineers-station master strategy so much that I'm not sure I want to explore other strategies.

Initial impression was not good.

There's simply too much going on in this game, and most of it will be irrelevant depending on what strategy you pick.  You still have to fiddle with those bits though.  Very inelegant, despite its "simple" turn structure.

I'm worried that this will end up near two games that I really didn't enjoy: The Gallerist and Russian Railroads.  The Gallerist had the same "simple" structure: pick one of four spots, do the consequences.  But you really had to plan everything out in advance, and not just in the "make sure you have enough wood and reed to build a room" kind of way.  You had to see how all of the gears interlocked to give you what you need to carry out your convoluted plan.  And if you didn't line it up right?  The gears ground to a halt, and your plans sputtered and flailed as you ran out of money and failed to do anything of note.  Same for GWT?

Russian Railroads I disliked because it was about picking one strategy and just doing that thing over and over and over to its inevitable conclusion.  No variance outside of minor trivialities, and just a quest to be ever so slightly more efficient than the other guy.  Sure, maybe two expert players could see one minor slip-up and exploit it to win the game, but I didn't have the patience or interest to invest that far.  Same for GWT?

I didn't feel like I was building anything.  I wasn't making interesting decisions from a limited selection of cards.  It didn't seem to be about solving puzzles, it was rather about optimizing a path.  I didn't have fun playing it.

I remember when I first saw this game, we were doing the setup, explaining the rules and so on and my reaction was: my God, this is overwhelming, so many things to remember, so many little details! Indeed, this is a game that blends a whole bunch of mechanics at once which may seem a mess at first, but it really isn't. To my surprise, it became really smooth and fast-paced after just 3-4 turns! It reminds me of Scythe, although that game is less complicated in rules. The actions itself are fairly simple and you're basically doing one thing during the game - getting your way to Kansas. Of course, before you get there you do various things, such as acquiring cattle, building new stuff, trading with natives, selling cows that you don't actually need etc. The fun part is that you actually may choose your way - one time you travel slowly, doing a whole variety of actions, another time you skip everything and go to Kansas as fast as possible because you collected a nice hand of cattle(because there's an excellent deckbuilding element there) and you want to sell it and gain profits. Ending of the game is based on how often players visit Kansas so the result of that is players themselves determine the pace of the game. That's cool.

What I like is, while the game is not a sandbox - you really have to focus on one or two main things, there's still a significant sense of freedom in terms of what strategy you want to pursue. I played only twice, so I can't go much into details of various strategies, but from the first time I felt that there are at least a few viable routes and ways of getting points, which you can also efficiently combine. I can already tell that it's probably impossible to skip building your deck completely, because each time you visit Kansas you want to sell better set of cattle than before(otherwise you'll probably get penalties). However, that deckbuilding part can be accompanied by constructing buildings, moving forward your train(well, you need to deliver these precious cows) - that's probably the most fiddly part of the game which is unintuitive and takes a while to get into, getting rid of hazard tiles that represent threats like rockfalls - another source of points and it makes your way to Kansas easier, you can focus on objective cards... just too much to describe it here, not to mention that by doing many of these things you constantly evolve your personal player board, gaining access to stronger side-actions... I'm impressed how Alexander Pfister managed to combine all these things so they work together and all these interactions between them, yet the game remains straightforward if only things are explained carefully before the game. The drawback is the lack of help tiles that describe the iconography - you have to remember it. 

To sum up I even see GWT could become a 9 in my catalog, although I'd have to play it more. True, it's long, it becomes brainburning at the end of the game but weirdly enough it's not tiresome like Terraforming Mars and Nations that have the same issue. It's just pleasant to play and I can see why it's so high in the ranking. It's nice thematically, some things don't make sense though, particularly those connected with the trains and railways - but they, after all it's an euro game, it has to works mechanically and yes, it does very well. Great game.

I disliked Mombasa from the same author as much as I really loved Great Western Trail. If Mombasa was a gratuitous mashup of popular mechanisms that didn't worked well together nor with the theme. Here, in sharp contrast, GWT has many mechanisms and subsystems that works very well together and moreover support the theme. The whole is better than the sum of its parts.

The turn sequence is really straightforward: 1/ move your character pawn, 2/ execute actions, 3/ refill your hand. The richness of the game comes from action 2 as depending on the space where you end your move you have a whole lot of actions to choose from. The net result is a smooth turn sequence with a lot of tactical and strategical choices.

The sheer number of options is a bit daunting for the first couple of play, afterward I really appreciated the diversity and refinement of the game. Early on you also need to learn the various pictograms used in the game, but I found them clear enough.

Overall GWT is both a game design achievement and a very enjoyable game to play and replay.

Fast, fun game game with a surprising amount of variety. Although the quality of your herd is the most important thing, there are many different paths to getting points. The board setup and buildings available, which seems like they would only have a minor impact, can greatly effect your strategy, as can the random entrance of workmen to hire. Play has been a blast, enhanced by the fact that experienced players can whiz through the game as the turns are so short. Best new game of 2016.

Only played 2 player so far, and I think it'll be better at 3 (or 4?), but it was enjoyable nonetheless. In our two games, we didn't get to San Francisco or build any buildings > Lvl 3, I think, but perhaps that was just our own play styles. Seems difficult to ignore the cowboys and train people though, since getting to KC is mandatory at some point, and the rules restrict where you may place your disc. Money is super tight, and getting better cattle seems critical.

First play was a bit rough since there is a lot going on and it is a little hard to figure out what you should be doing.

This game comes across as a tad more thematic than your average point salad Euro, and it's lots of fun despite its familiar feel: shades of Hansa Teutonica in the way that you remove discs from your personal board to augment your abilities; shades of Dominion in the way you enlarge and improve your deck; shades of Russian Railroads in the way you upgrade your buildings (locomotives); shades of Automania in the way you enhance the breeding strength of cattle (popularity of an automobile).
      I think, though, that you have to execute the "train" strategy just right to win with it. The other two main strategies seem to give you a greater margin for error.

Inches up some more.  It's starting to grow on me.

Moves up slightly after a few more plays as it's one of those Euro puzzles I've enjoyed coming back to. The theme and iconography really help, too.

[September 2017 - 7.2]
I'm not sure what to rank Great Western Trail. I think it's a good game as a Euro/programming/puzzle with some variety, but it's not my favorite game in what's already my not-so-favorite genre of games. 

As with many of these games, I think it lacks the interaction for me and could of benefited from trading out one of its many point-salad paths to victory with a little more interaction (eg. pay to use other's buildings, or some blocking -- which is what I enjoy about Le Harve as a great Euro game.) Still, Great Western Trail gains points for a good theme, good iconography and pretty smooth gameplay once you get into it.  

Ultimately, though, if I'm going to play a game like this, I'd rather play Railroad Revolution, as it doesn't overstay its welcome, while offering a slightly cleaner but still challenging puzzle.

A whole wodge of game - lots of moving parts and a lot to get your head round on the first play. It's like several other games cludged together, but which somehow remains playable. 

- The deck-building part is a little underwhelming as it's mainly just suits/value you can add to your deck rather than cards with abilities to combo together.
- It badly needs a player aid (per-player) to decrypt the iconography.
- There are VP all over the place.
- Engagement with the theme is nowhere - it's just a bunch of mechanisms. 

I t starts out quite entertaining and you never feel boxed in and there's always something you can do, but it goes on a little too long for what it is, repeats itself a little too often , is just a little too fiddly and a lot too dry.

You only start to appreciate the depth to the game after a playing through the game a couple of times. Beautifully balanced game with no one option being the best play, so you have to decide your game play based on what your opponents do and don't do. I was a huge fan of Mombasa, and I have to say this game has a similar feel in that it combines many well known mechanics, however, this game surpasses Mombasa in strategy and depth and is just plain fun to play.

Sometimes the game points you in a different direction.  This is a major positive in my book and the reason for the bump up.  Best new game I've played in awhile.

Nothing particularly hard or counter intuitive in the rules, just lots of them, lots of bits. Actually playing the game is not too hard as you are always choosing from between a handful of decisions, all of which are usually a bit good, but not as good as the optimal move. This makes the game rewarding. The turns are also very quick. However the game is long anyway so additionally players adds mostly time rather than much else, though the game is not multiplayer solitaire. Theme is nice, nothing much more - it's mildly thematic. The components are good. The time does fly during playing this and it feels as if most strategies could work. I like getting cows and pruning, rather than building, I generally do poorly. Overall this is an excellent Euro game, preferable to terraforming mars in my mind, not that those two are really that comparable. Highly recommended.

Addendum, recent handful of plays at 2 player count, play time minus set up can go down to about 90 minutes, though I don't imagine it will go any lower; game is more strategic than I first thought, it's not heavy, its rich. Overal this is one of the best euros I have ever played, if you can get round the 'lot of simple' rules explanation. Great stuff.

Why don't I like this game more? It's the kind of game I really like, but I felt like it was a game full of buckets, where each bucket says, "Throw money here to get victory points."

But the mechanics are interesting enough that I want to play again and see if I'm wrong.

This is a really good one.  Could(stress this word)approach Agricola (#1 game) status for me.  My single gripe (in our experience) is that it far outstays it's welcome the first 2 to 3 plays.  It took newbie 4p groups 3 to even 4+ hours and a group full of 2nd timers just under 3. This can make it tough for some to muster the desire to replay. However, once you get in a rhythm it zooms at ~2hrs and is wonderfully unique with each play with juicy strategic and tactical decisions aplenty wrapped in a light/fun theme.  Need some more plays to flesh it out.

I am the exception here... I liked the game but not that much. Theme is great and mechanisms are fine. But feels fiddly, with lots of small moving parts and I am not a fan generally of deck builders. so there you go. Overall felt quite convoluted. Would play if asked though.

Mombasa was my favourite game from 2015. Could the on-form designer, Mr.Pfister, do it again? The answer is an unreserved ‘YES’. Great Western Trail is quite simply brilliant.

Great Western Trail is Mombasa-like in weight, possibly a little more complex, and Mombasa-like in the wonderful puzzle-type nature of the game. There is not a huge amount of interaction, less than Mombasa, but I rate this very highly indeed and look forward to exploring it some more over the forthcoming months.

The design is very clever: it is an interesting hybrid of action selection, card hand management, race, and player-board optimisation. There is, as you would expect, a ton of things to think about, and this is another game which could keep you up at night thinking through the options and what you might do different next time.

By looking at the cover I wouldn't have given it a second thought.
But seeing it appear from nowhere and jumping straight on 14th place in BGG ranking system, I knew I had to know more.
Convinced by some of my favourite reviewers I gave it a shot and surely I wasn't disappointed.

It's a solid deep game, with some interesting twists compared to the other games I played and it's not even that long. The choices are interesting, the game is strategic and tactical and the deckbuilding component is working really well.

Recommended.

Great (western) Euro game by new genius Alexander Pfister. It draws mechanics from Hansa Teutonica, Caylus and Dominion and places them in American west, where players compete to transport cows from Kansas to San Francisco and beyond. Yes, players are cowboys, builders and train workers. The game has huge variability and multiple (or at least) three viable strategies. Top notch.

RATING: 7.5
Initial rating 8 but i ding it a 1/2 point to 7.5 due to a niggly amount of small rules.

but base game is simple and intuitive with a ton of layers chrome on top, which reduces the ability to play without reviewing the rule book. whatever happened to the modern euro of the 90's, as this is not it.

but the play track is maybe an homage to caylus and the game has a similar feel as a result, so if you like caylus then this might be a game for you.

I had really high expectations for this one so that might color my opinion a bit. After two plays I find the game enjoyable and I like the mixture of mechanics, but it's really hard to gain a clear picture of what you should be focusing on during the game. It has somewhat a similar feel than Castles of Burgundy with the whole point salad vibe but the actual play reminds me more of maybe Voyages of Marco Polo (not very similar but scratches the same itch for me). However in both of those mentioned games I find it easier to have a clear picture of what I should be working on while the game is going on and currently I can't really see GWT overtaking either of those games.

I'll give it some more plays and revisit the review.

A combination of deck building and personal engine growth, as players collect cattle cards and progress across a board that fills in with player buildings over time. The number of options each turn opens up quickly, but towards the endgame becomes slightly easier as players weigh up the necessary actions required to complete all their personal objectives. Neat euro.

This game is fantastic.  So far I have only played two player, but I can see how the game would probably be even better with a higher player count.  4 seems like it might take a long time.  Our first play through at 2 took aver two hours,  due to the iconogrophy, so be aware of that.  In reality the play is rather simple, though there are a lot of moving parts and ideas on what you can do.  We  love it!

Pfister hits another one out of the park. Lots of interesting choices and decisions to make. Plenty of victory paths to take.

2017-02-11 : I don't get the hype over this game. It's complex - lots of little mechanics and intricacies - but offers very little depth and is seriously hampered by the rather high luck factor. Draw the wrong cards at the wrong time and you're hosed. For instance : you need a good hand to be able to unlock the hand-size increasing spot which you'll need to build the even higher hand values. And that's just one example. This game is that damning combination of complexity and randomness I simply don't like. Compared to Mombasa - also complex - but where you can formulate a strategy and execute it, The difference cannot be more clearly illustrated as that in Mombasa a card you buy goes into your hand, guaranteeing you can play it at the most optimal time - in other words : long term planning - whereas in this game it goes into your discard pile and you may never see it again. So overall, this is clearly the lesser game and a shining example of a game that is in dire need of a developer who should have  streamlined it - a lot.

SOLD IT!

The game has a bunch of working/scoring parts which is good. The ability to build the repeating board in a Caylus fashion is also a plus. While the idea of a player board that adds powers as it losses bits (Hansa Teutonica) is great in theory, the impact of these powers is very samey and not terribly exciting in Great Western Trail. Claiming cities upon cattle delivery late in the game is often frustrating... you can end up with one of your best made deliveries, only to be penalized by having to claim a lesser city since you already claimed the middle scoring ones in between. The achievement cards should always be a welcome reward, but in this game they can be a curse (think curse in Dominion) and often impossible to score ones acquired later in the game.

The game works and I get the hype, but it just feels a bit untested and flat in too many categories to be a "legend" as it sells itself as. Not sure it has earned the right to stay over other games in my collection,

America in the 19th century: You are a rancher and repeatedly herd your cattle from Texas to Kansas City, where you send them off by train. This earns you money and victory points. Needless to say, each time you arrive in Kansas City, you want to have your most valuable cattle in tow. However, the "Great Western Trail" not only requires that you keep your herd in good shape, but also that you wisely use the various buildings along the trail. Also, it might be a good idea to hire capable staff: cowboys to improve your herd, craftsmen to build your very own buildings, or engineers for the important railroad line.

If you cleverly manage your herd and navigate the opportunities and pitfalls of Great Western Trail, you surely will gain the most victory points and win the game.

I’m consistently last in this game so I’m in position to verify these ways in which you’ll get crushed:

• don’t focus on any particular strategy; try to do a bit of everything
• deliver to Kansas City less than other players
• spend all your money the first couple laps

Still, I enjoy GWT; even though I suck more than anyone else I play with — including first-time players — at least my score does improve on each play.

Out of the three top games of 2016, along with Terraforming Mars and Scythe, GWT might be my top choice.

RATING: 9.5
Have only played this game a couple of times so far but already see how much potential this game has to stay on the shelf for a long time. The game is somewhat of a race because a player may charge that Kansas city space which furthers the game timer instead of spending time on the board to maximize profits. The first time I played I only scored 41 points which obviously shows we knew nothing about the game. The second time I scored 143 points. The card drafting aspect and how the cards interact with the tile spaces on the board is amazing. Feels like you are really accomplishing and building something which is not how ive experience other card drafting games.

After our first play, we thought the cowboy strategy was overpowered. Then I saw someone crush with a builder strategy. Then I crushed with a hybrid strategy. I can only assume that there’s an engineer strategy as well. In each of my four plays, people were standing up a lot while playing.

I like my deckbuilding when it’s built into the framework of a larger game, and that’s what you have here. You can add more powerful cards to your hand and cull the weaker ones. Cards are used for action spaces and for much needed income. 

At the same time, it’s not a requirement and you can go a different way and focus on hiring more workers. Cowboys make acquiring cards cheaper, craftsmen allow you to build better buildings, and engineers move your train (for different benefits). 

In addition to deckbuilding, there’s a nice spatial element in how you move around the board to different action spaces (that are randomized each game), making the board a rondel. The rondel aspect forces interesting timing questions for what to do with your money. You probably can’t buy new cards and hire workers this time around so which one do you do now? Players add buildings to the board that change things up and generally slow everyone down.
 
I’m excited to play again, and I can see room for an expansion of new action tiles.

Update: This is Best of 2016 for me. A keeper.

The way that all the pieces in this come together is very impressive. The trail continues to expand, simultaneously increasing the amount of action spaces but also in a way blocking others along the path as well--this is really slick. There are some unique ways that these mechanisms come together, and the theme really helps (especially when teaching it). The game *can* go on slightly long but I don't mind at all especially when we're all enjoying the experience.

MAR 2017: After my 14th play, I am bumping the rating down to an 8, and wonder if it will drop to a 6 by next year. I still enjoy the challenge of the game, but am finding the variability of the game to be smaller than one would expect: only the cheaper buildings get built often in my play groups, which means we see the same ones over and over. The other sources of variability (cattle cards, bonus tiles, bonus cards, order of neutral buildings) offer minor "wrinkles" of variability.

DEC 2016 (later in the month): My intial impressions about the deckbuilding didn't do it justice. It's not a traditional deckbuilder - more of a deck management game, and it's growing on me quickly. What's best about this game is how many strategic approaches the game allows. I've seen high cattle win and low cattle win, buildings win and deliveries win. Really look forward to keep this game in the collection for a while.

DEC 2016: One solo play two-handed to get the hang of the game, and it didn't really grab me the way I was hoping it would. I was hoping for a broad and deep strategy game built around deck-building, but the deck-building isn't really and interesting driver of gameplay. They are just fuel for cash and some of the point-generation. Managing the other parts is more interesting. If those parts of the game (train, placement, upgrading buildings, movement pacing) prove to be tense and interesting, it might jump to an 8. 

OCT 2016: Visually, this game really sings! I'm fairly certain I'll like the mechanics in this game. The set-up and parts of the gameplay remind me [i]a lot[/i] of Terra Mystica, but more linear and slightly linear (since there is no map/expansion). My only real concern is that the series of small decisions that a player makes as they travel to Kansas City will feel too euro and/or not tight enough. If the tension is there, I will enjoy this game.

Wow, there is a lot going on here.  This is a heavy, point salad, game, although i like it way better than any of Feld's theme-less games.  It's also long, about 3 1/2 hours for 4 players, 3 of whom were new.

Seems to be varying strategies that could all work.  I went with a building heavy strategy and wound up winning by about 6 pts.  No one  went heavy into cows or trains, so those options seem like other places to get big points.

I enjoyed the variety of the buildings, the limited building slots, and how you can chain buildings together.

Like Russian Railroads, this has the potential issue where if you try and equally do a little bit of everything (train, buildings, cows) you probably won't win over someone that was heavy into one of those and just a little into the others.

Definitely want to play again.  In terms of heavier Euro's, this one has a much more enjoyable theme.

On a second play, I lowered my rating a bit due to my poor planning.  I decided to go in to a heavy cow strategy but failed to realize the extra buildings we were using didn't have any cow buying spots on them or any worker buying spots.  I also erred in not plopping down some early buildings in the later half of the board which limited my money going into the worker buying location which for this play was right before Kansas City.

I still enjoy this game, although it is long.

Another perfect 10 game for me. This is a great game for two players. It does run a little long, but even our first full game, after having a good grasp of the rules, lasted just under two hours. Not bad. I really like how you can mix and match different strategies throughout the game. I focused on a little of everything: a decent deck of cattle cards, three higher scoring buildings, and getting pretty far along the train track, with station upgrades. Can't wait to play again, and the game itself isn't that difficult at all once you get going. Up to the very last turn, I still found myself planning the right moves to maximize the amount of points I would finish with. Sure enough, I did win it on the last turn by upgrading an 8-pt. train station, which won it for me 106-102. A definite keeper! Highly recommend!

Great game. Love the theme so much that it's a pleasure to win or lose.  Lots of victory point options.

Rule book a little intimidating and easy to miss nuances in first plays.  My current favourite game.

Now this is a gamer's game. Total point salad with a lot of unforgiving choices. Made to make you regret your mistakes, but as long as other players aren't totally out of your league, you should be able to make up for it - there's little engine building or fallaway loser syndrome what I can see.

The one big drawback is the downtime. The player interactions are really small, with a few areas where you could benefit or be hindered by others, yet waiting for what other people do is a major part of the game. Knowing your move in advance means that you'll do it in 30 seconds flat, while you'll have to wait for the AP player who takes 10 minutes to complete his.

Lehetne jó is, de túl hosszú, pláne ahhoz képest amennyi van benne és a legkevésbé sem elegáns a szabályrendszere.

- "Marha" hosszú. Nekünk hárman közel 4 óra volt, pedig egyáltalán nem vagyunk AP-sek.
- Ráadásul nem csak hosszú, de érezhetően el is húzódik. A vége felé sok kör lement úgy, hogy már nem volt veszély lapka, nem volt marha. Alig volt sátor. Kellemetlenül be is szűkült ettől.
- Mindezek tetejébe szerintem 4 órás hevijuróhoz képest furcsán nagy a szerencse szerepe. A 18 pénzt egyszerűen nem lehet mázli nélkül még akkor se összeszedni, ha minden jó kártyából van a paklidban és folyamatosan hegeszted a handedet. És ha csak egyetlen petákkal lemaradsz, akkor +9 pontból lesz -3 vagy akár -6 is, mert muszáj tenned valamelyik nyomi városra. Az elhúzódó végével együtt ez simán 50 pont swingeket eredményezhet, ami irreális.

Great Western Trail is an amalgam of several different mechanisms and pulls it all together in a nicely interlocking package. It allows for both specialization and a more varied approach but the one overarching requirement with everything you do is getting the timing right. Slow the game down in order to deliver a more valuable cattle herd to Kansas City? Accelerate in order to get first pick of the available helpers or contracts? Take a detour for a bonus action?

The somewhat distracting board makes grasping the game a little harder than it needs to be but the flow of the game is remarkably simple: advance pawn, take building action until you get to Kansas City, then restart from the beginning. And each time the landscape subtly changes.

In my oppinion, a game that has train meeples can't be bad. And actually, Great Western Trail is much more to my liking than Mombasa. But the game is waaaaaaaaaaay to long. In the end, all 4 of us were only choosing characters when in Kansas in order to speed up the game at least a little. The game mechanics (not to speak of the theme) does not carry over the whole 3+ hours it takes and therefore it becomes extremely repetitive. Yes, you may go this route or that one, doing one thing or the other...so what? GWT is definitely not a keeper for our group and after all the praise for GWT received, I expected somewhat more.

Spiel mir das Spiel vom Rind: Alexander Pfister macht sich mit einer Viehherde durch die Weiten und Weiden des Wilden Westen auf den Weg nach Kansas City, um dort weiter Siegpunkte für seine steile Karriere zu sammeln: mit GREAT WESTERN TRAIL tritt er was Anspruch und Spielintelligenz angeht in seinen Cowboyboots in die Fußstapfen seines Afrika-Smashers. Die Handschrift von MOMBASA in GWT ist unverkennbar: all diese vielen, beweglichen Teile, die das Spiel zur gleichen Wasserschaukel machen. Dabei kann der Grundmechanismus simpler nicht sein: Suche Dir mit Deinen Rindern den besten Trail. Ein Spielzug bei GWT ist kürzer als bei MOMBASA: Einfach 1-x Felder weiterziehen und die Aktion des Zielfeldes ausführen. Allerdings ist diese mit so vielen Stellen im Spiel verschraubt, dass der Schädel unter dem Skalp raucht wie eine Smith&Wesson. Optionen, Optionen, Optionen. Allein die Variable der Grundgebäude kreiert Gewichtungen und Abläufe. Wem der Schatten vom MOMBASA über GWT zu groß ist, dem  gibt allein das Thema Grund: "Um den Wilden Westen zu sehen, solange es ihn noch gibt“, wie der dreckige Indianderkumpel John Dunbar einst sagte. Great Pfister Game.

Great Western Trail is a stunning achievement in design, as far as designing a game where a dizzying number of mechanisms are made to all work together. One of the larger point salad games I've played in recent memory that "feels" balanced.  It almost makes you wonder whether Pfister and the design team used a computer to help aid in the balancing, as there are numbers, actions, and opportunities for squeezing out points from everywhere and yet nothing felt overly powerful without dinging you somewhere else if you pursued only one road to points. I'm not a fan of paying off other players to move across their buildings, as money always felt tight and it was just that little extra meanness that made for a little extra pain. Still, it promotes players to race to that one objective (of many), so it is an obvious part of the game.  At times the mini-maxing can be grueling, but rarely more so than other games of this type. The overuse of iconography could easily be too much to handle for some, but it didn't wear as bad on me as I thought it might.  The fact that the publishers didn't include a symbol summary sheet is a little puzzling.  Overall, I'm impressed by the interworkings of this game and yet I'm not a real fan of how much the game relies on icon-heavy, chaining effects to get things done. Yes, this is a typical Euro thing, but with GWT it is almost too much.  The game is so overwrought on icon effects that it feels rather divorced from the theme, or at the very best it buries the theme.  It's just a hard game to get jazzed about as I need to feel the theme even a little, and GWT does nothing to make that happen.  Lastly, the game really does thrust the delivering of cattle as a main part of the game, but if one or two players pursue this relentlessly, the other players must switch up their long-term strategy if they want to stay in the competition. But the game doesn't really make this need explicit. It's something you have to learn over multiple plays, which is fine, but I do wish the game was a little more obvious with its paths to victory.  Pursuing a win in GWT can be opaque if you're forced out of going for the obvious "cattle" strategy.  Overall, GWT is a a game I'm impressed with in terms of mechanistic complexity, but the theme is obscured under the mechanisms so much so and the system is so overwrought at times that I'm not that motivated to experience it again any time soon.

Many interesting options in a game that feels quick to play. 
Great combos to be had. 
Well integrated deck building aspect, that also works well in the theme. 
Worker placement with action trail works well. 
Player board upgrades like in Scythe are good, even though there are two types of upgrades and the weaker kind can feel like it does not make much difference after a while. 
- Randomness in the draw might have rather big impact. If you get the right cards and can upgrade a black instead of a white chip. That gives more points now but also a big advantage take up to six steps instead of 4 for example. 
- No catch up mechanism and hard to counter a leader. 
- Found a great strategy and other strategies feel way weaker, for example moving the train feels less important then upgrading your deck. Cowboys are way better then Engineers. 

Really looking forward to playing again and see what great opportunies lay ahead in the next game and how to make the most of them.

A fascinating crunchy Euro with a lot of different viable strategies. Several tracks, level ups, action tracks but none of them is mandatory. You can mix and match and don't need to reach the top of any track. Take that Tzolk'in, Rococo and Snowdonia! Excellent game.

I liked this one more than Mombasa, mainly because the theme spoke to me more as well as each of the main mechanics in the game.

The game has 3 main elements: Deck building (cows), buildings, and trains. I would say the train part stands out as the most important of the 3, followed up by cows and then buildings. But I haven't had a chance to explore a big building strategy yet

It's a deck builder so slimming your deck is important but the game also offers you other ways to navigate through your deck by drawing and discarding or buying more big cards.

My only concern after 1 play is that going for some trains is a must strategy since so many things play off of that track.

--------------------

2nd play (3p) turned out a lot differently. A lot more buildings came into play, the winner used one to great effect to place a token on SF by moving his train back. Culling was not that important, I removed 6 cards but it probably wasn't needed and actually put me behind because I went for it too early. ~4 cards would have been enough since I went heavy cowboys this game and bought so many, my deck was full of good stuff. Only 1 other person culled and only like 2 cards

A lot of mechanics that work well together - basically a set building game where you cycle through a map that you help build out - seems to be multiple paths to victory.  Was enjoyable and turns were quick even though the 4p game lasted 3h - not counting explanation.

RATING: 7
People may criticise the game for offering nothing really new, but the interlocking tried and tested mechanics work in a clever way, although all of these easy to overlook rules do make the game feel rather inelegant. By far my biggest gripe with the game is its length, at about 45 minutes per player it tends to drag. This problem is magnified by the fact that the later turns tend to have you doing pretty much the same things again and again and for me all that intrigue and excitement that the game does such a wonderful job to build up sadly peters out as the game draws to a close.

I don't know yet if I wouldn't prefer Caylus or a pure Rondell game over this interesting mix. Game is well-embedded in a theme, only that you will proceed slower with more buildings is not really explained.

Concerning the rulebook. Again a rulebook that seems nice for learning the game but once you want to look up sth, it is a nightmare. Perhaps such games need two set of rules nowadays (like TtA), because pure rulebooks (not "explaining" the game) aren't accepted in the market anymore.

Update: Will prefer Caylus, but I need to understand better how to influence the course of the game by placing buildings.

Not a game dripping with theme or elegance, but one that presents some interesting choices once you start to understand the engine and scoring. Takes patience to learn, and even more to teach. From my limited plays, it seems to have struck a very delicate balance between different scoring opportunities, and the opportunities to gear your engine towards them. Player interaction is subtle but distinctly relevant. Managing the end game is difficult. Having made it through the rules and a couple plays now, I find myself getting sucked into this one, and don't see it letting up soon.

Follow-up:
This game reminds me in an odd way, of Power Grid. It's a clunky mix mechanics, but one that comes together very well. It does a great job with 'multiple paths to victory'. It's a bit to set up and tear down, and there's luck with both your personal card draws as well as tile draws, starting position, bonus cards, etc. Overall though, I can live with these for an interesting game experience. 
Note: we've house ruled that everyone gets the same number of turns, as first player would otherwise have a significant advantage in our view.

RATING: 4
Interesting mechanics, but the theme is totally botched. Most of the breeds of cattle in this game are DAIRY cattle! Not beef cattle! They needed to do a little bit of research to figure this out. They needed shorthorn and hereford. Not Jersey and Guernsey and Holstein and Ayrshire. No! Plus, cattle drives went to Dodge City and Abilene and Wichita, not Kansas City. KC was the first major stop on the railroad. KC had huge stockyards. From here, cattle were shipped to other locations, such as Chicago, for butchering. Again, they needed to do just a little bit of research. But they didn't do that. Also, the ranches that drove their cattle to the market towns had nothing to do with the railroads. And little to nothing to do with buildings erected along the cattle drive trails. But this was the era of the open range, when cattle roamed free. The game however is largely about cattle breeds that were were developed and managed in their own pens (or in other words, it's about the closed range, not the open range). This is a game for people who don't know and don't care about how cattle drives really worked. It's a game for people who care about game mechanics, and in that respect its mechanics are sufficiently complex to have attracted a lot of interest. But I struggle to care about how elegant the mechanics might be when I'm looking at a hand of dairy cattle for two plus hours. I wish the game was instead about getting the cattle to market in good shape so that they were healthy and fat. This would allow them to receive a top grade and thus top dollar. Rushing herds to market would be bad. They would be skinny and not command a good return. I can envision the game being about managing time so that you spend neither too long nor too short a period of time on the trail. While you have to deal with the threat of stampedes that might scatter cattle across the plains. You're trying to make sure the cattle eat and drink well throughout the trip, especially immediately before you drive the herd into Dodge City or Abilene or Wichita. You would also have to deal with rustlers. Where are rustlers in the game?

RATING: 10
Do you like COWS? Do you like escorting parties of cows across the American West so that they can get on trains and have exciting HOLIDAYS? Holidays which definitely do not have a meat packing plant as the final destination? If so, this game is for you (and if you refuse to enjoy it, the sinister looking ghostly cowboys on the back of the board will come for you).

It's the game of exciting cow tourism - who will construct the most enticing selection of attractions along the scenic and eponymous trail? Who will lure the most prestigious cows to the railway station for exhilirating adventures?

Anyway. It's good. Fairly complicated, but the systems mesh together nicely so it's not too hard to pick up.

It's a solid but heavy euro. It uses a mix of deck building and engine building with a great re-imagining of a classic rondel to drive everything. It has a breadth of strategies and interesting choices. For such a heavy game, one of its biggest strengths are the speed of each round. Every small action is so simple that the pace never stops going. That said, it's still a rather long game, yet it ends at just the right time. There's quite a cumbersome set-up and while the iconography is consistent and the rulebook is well written, it's a pain to teach. There's also not quite enough interaction for me, the buildings are fun and there's tight competition for everything, but I just feel like something is missing.

The lack of more meaningful player interaction and the fact that all points are scored at the end are non-starters for me. I recognize why people like the game but it is not for me.

PROS
-The board art is really pretty and the components are nice.
-There are several moving parts to this game but nothing that is that complicated. I thought the teach was going to take much longer than it actually did.
-The choice of pacing is interesting. 
-Lots of different kinds of things to shoot for: trains/stations, workers, buildings, and goal cards.

CONS
-A ton of components to set up. 
-Not enough player interaction.
-And #1 beef: everything is scored at the end. I just don't care for this in games.

I am surprise how long it took for this game to become popular. Very unique, and a fresh take on the mechanics it borrows. The game is engaging, and keeps a good pace throughout. Not much to complain about this game, but for fairness purposes: The box seems thin, since it uses the standard stronghold box cardboard stock which is slightly better than Hasbro. The iconography for the money is not as intuitive as it should be. But this are minor details, the game is solid and engaging. The different avenues for winning, and how you can combine them creates for a different experience each time. Highly recommend, one of the best games of the year for sure.

Mechanics: mainly deck building, you will build and do other staff, but need a good deck
Decisions: lot of
Opinion: really lovely game, you have a deck with your cows on different colors and values, that will be increasing and upgrading during the game, and have to deliver those cows to Kansas. This is the main goal of the game, but in order to do so you have so many things to do and decisions to take.
Should I go faster to Kansas or should I go slower but with more actions during the path. Should I build here to stop others, or should do that there to benefit more myself.
As already said, the main goal is to deliver your cows to Kansas, and you need a good deck with different cows in different colors and values. This makes the game to be quite easy to understand from the first play, further plays will be used to enjoy more the game and exploit different strategies. In the end you will score for lot of things, all of them following this delivery of cows to Kansas.
I think I will never say no to a game of Great western

It's important to realize this is really a deck-building game in slow-motion. Some strategy hints:

Invest in enough temporary certificates early in the game to be able to reach your first city at 10 points that will allow you to increase your hand size. Once you do this, you need to increase the variety of cattle in your deck quickly, and invest in the double upgrade that allows you to cycle cards in your hand. This seems to be the most important early game strategy.

Synergistic placement of buildings is also key, as is placing buildings at the right point in your cycle so that you'll have the resources you need to take the action at that time. For example, you want to ensure that you have enough money when you visit the recruit or market actions.

Think about what you want to do right before getting to Kansas City and place buildings appropriately. Having a last chance to cycling cards in your hand if you need to seems to be a good choice.

Getting the right station agents can also pay off big at the end, so don't neglect them. Permanent certificates are very powerful, especially since removing the token on the level 5 certificate is an inefficient choice compared to other options. Don't focus on goal cards too early, as they will only clog up your deck and potentially give negative points if you play them and can't complete them.

Force yourself to move quickly to Kansas City--don't dawdle just because you can potentially do something along the way. Consider the tradeoff of getting to Kansas City and then back through the beginning of the trail (with recruit and build actions if you're playing the standard game) versus a few extra dollars or train movement points. Trading off velocity with actions is critically important; it can be tempting to take every action you can, but players who move faster will build their engines faster.

Don't be afraid to spend all your money--lack of money lets you pass other players' toll gates without helping them, and there are many opportunities to get more money along the way while also cycling cards. Through most of the game, if you have a lot of money sitting around, you're not being efficient enough.

Don't worry about the train too much; it will generally take care of itself as long as you stay close to the pack and can leapfrog opponents here and there. The upgrade that allows you to move the train forward a space is almost worthless (especially compared to the draw+discard upgrade) when you can move 2-3 spaces in one action by leapfrogging opponents.

Wasted turns if you plan poorly are an unfortunate problem, and players on a roll improve really quickly. Don't forget VPs on cattle, hazards, and buildings, but don't optimize for those until mid- to late-game.

Many problems: Taxation is unreasonably punishing early in the game with players throwing down tax buildings in objectively-optimal spots. Cows of the same color have different point values for no reason other than to randomly reward players, and the same can be said of the hazards. Objectives can stall out with multiple San Francisco primary objectives clogging the queue, forcing players to take sub-optimal objectives. At the beginning of the game, hazards can be asymmetrically distributed, rendering some parts of the board inaccessible for building for 2/3 of the game. Cowboys are supremely expensive when compared to the net benefits that you accrue from builder (you overpay for cowboys so that you can 'overpay less' for cows). 

It's possible that there is a good game underneath all of this, perhaps for 2 players. I like the idea that players can set the pace of the game by cycling through a queue of possible actions. However, the game completely falters at 3 and 4 players simply because there are not enough optimal build spaces to go around; someone will always be shorted.

Fave Pfister so far, though sadly that's not saying much.

The balance of "do one thing a lot" vs. "do everything a little" seemed more intuitive to me than it has been in some other big multi-system Euros. On the other hand, it was a painful shock when I realized that I'd used up all the easy cities to deliver to and was then going to be [b]penalized[/b] every time I went to Kansas City unless I improved my herd. I've rarely felt such despair over the limits to how fast I can bootstrap the deckbuilding element in a game.

Where have you been all my life, Alexander Pfister? I've yet to play a game by this dude that I've not loved, and Great Western Trail has been the pinnacle so far. 

I had no initial interest in playing it because the theme didn't excite me al that much, but the buzz around this one finally convinced me to jump when I got the chance to try it, and it was love at first play. 

This is a game that I want to carry with me everywhere I go and teach it to new players. I want to play it more often with the same players so we can cut down on the play time, but that said, even though nearly every play of this game has gone over three hours, that time just flies by, the game is so much fun.

A gamer's game, as it initially appears to be a heavy game, but after a few turns, everything becomes intuitive and makes sense.

Initial game rule explanation took about 30-40 minutes, but we covered everything.  Could be shorter as a lot of rules can be explained as we play the first few turns and make the first delivery.

Very good production value.
Rules are well written.
Excellent replayability (with random placement of neutral buildings)

Best to play with 2-3 players initially to learn the game, as 4 players may make the game a tad long, not to mention that it takes a game to get a good grasp of the value of the various placement locations, and how the game flows with regards to hazards, train movement/options, hiring crew, and the light deck building aspect.

All in all, a very good game experience.

A fair amount of pieces.  The instructs seem well enough written.  We did get confused with rail movement, stations, and destinations, but it was late in the evening.  Overall, the game is fun and provides lots to do- even with 2 players.  Guess better not tell euro gamers that this cow trail really did exist.  Might be a historic war game if it had a giant foldout map of the central region of the USA, actual Indian tribes, and frontier settlements.

I didn't like this game at first i felt that it was too repetitive. You start and walk over the place over and over again which is actually true. The game offers some deep strategic option which is good but i feel it lacks a bit of player interaction. After five games my opinion hasn't changed a lot but started to like the game more. I still don't love this game but im into it if someone wants to play it actually.

One play. Almost felt Feld-like: everything can earn you points, and we ended up with very similar scores. There is a lot of different ways to victory with this one, I'm sure, but I also guess you'd need more than just one opponent to push you into exploring these new avenues. Sadly, the game will probably be too slow and long with 3-4 players.

An enjoyable Euro. Very much a top heavy kitchen sink, typical of the meaty Euros of its generation. Finding the best way to work through both your draws and the board  sequence is a compelling puzzle. A couple of notable drawbacks however. One, it’s rules heavy. 30+ minutes to teach. Two, randomness especially in the early game can have a very significant impact on the outcome. Three, turn order is big deal. The game should play to even turns.

I've been a huge fan of Alexander Pfister's games since I first found Port Royal. I really enjoyed Mombasa, and I'm positive I would enjoy this title as well, but my play group didn't enjoy it as much as I did on our first play. For this reason, I really want to play this game but I'm likely won't buy it for myself.

Great game and I really love the way that the action track slowly builds up and makes for a different game each time. Maybe one or two cog-wheels to many to be aware of, though everything still fits nicely and even thematicaly (for a Eurogame :) ). First game does take a long time, including rules' explanation simply for so much stuff going on which needs to be explained.

The game board is your rondel, with new pieces being constructed/added/removed over the course of the game or appearing as people make their laps around and around! After thinking about it like this, it was easier for me to process all the stuff going ons.

There is a side "deck building" aspect to it, but it is as minor as you want it to be. Everyone has the same slim deck of cards, which contain four different colors (cattle). When you get to the end of the board (Kansas City), you'll want to have as many different colors as possible in your 4-card hand because that's the gist of how to make more money/points. The game will be pushing you to make higher and higher deliveries each time. There is a space where you can buy more cards/cattle, and the ability to cull cards from your deck, but this is just one avenue to scoring your points. One of the players didn't cull any cards, acquired a few extra cattle, and focused more on building stations, and was 1 point behind first.

EDIT: After a few plays, it seems to be a good idea early on to focus on putting out buildings on the board and hiring builders--it will hurt a lot later in the game when the board gets clogged with other players' buildings. Taking the -6 pt delivery space isn't as detrimental as it sounds as it gives you $6 which can be extremely helpful early on (ie: essentially free worker).
I have tended to invest in the auxiliary actions that gives coins and in mid-game, trash cards; I rarely use the "draw one discard one" action, but it seems to be liked by a lot of people.

RATING: 7
A kind of cross between Dominion and Perpetual Motion with a bit of Caylus thrown in. Not bad, but this game is unapologetically a snowball. There's no catchup, so it's essential to do well at the start, once you're behind you're contending for the minor placings. Increasing your hand size is particularly crucial, without it you'll never deliver the higher value herds. I've been saying for some time that the Eurogame design space is mined out, but as long as people keep buying, this is the kind of thing that will be produced.

The theme and the mechanics did not convince me. Maybe need more plays to rate it higher. But until now (after first play), I feel it got no depth at all. I tend to like games with rather more interaction (there are some exceptions like A Feast For Odin, wich i really enjoyed a lot). But the fact it is a game with low interaction and theme not fitting my taste and the mecanics not thrilling me, I keep my rating quite low. The compelxicitiy of it, is the part I liked and why I keep it over 6.0

I enjoy playing this every time so for now my rating stays at 9. The randomizing of starting tiles and buildings however doesn't feel different enough. You can mainly still follow the same strategy every game if you like. The builders seem way too weak, you need the cowboys and the train guys to get somewhere on the track and have some decent cows in your cattle. 

I don't know what it's staying power will be.

After initial play this will be the game that makes me want to start rating games. 10. Big 10. Lots of good decisions, not a huge amount of interaction but enough to keep my interested. Fast turns and a need to adapt strategy as things change. Not a lot of luck besides the cow draw but that can be negated as the game goes on. (yes it does suck though at the beginning). Interested to see how this will hold up to replays. Rating will be adjusted then.

I was hesitant at first because of the cows / cowboy theme, which is not really my favorite theme. Yet the game completely convinced me - the first play was actually a bit bland and slow, but when you know the rules and when you randomize the neutral buildings it becomes so interesting! And even though you are mainly playing your own game, there is quite a bit of interaction for building spaces and train stations, trying to outthink the opponent and adjusting your plays.

The card drafting with the cows is also fascinating - exchanging cows for money during the trip, yet still trying to get a good hand for Kansas city. You can influence many things yet still depend on some of the randomness and need to adjust the strategy, which is engaging. Highly recommend!

Game has extraordinary tempo and even players may change that if they want. Cowboys always seems betters than other workers. Still it has much to offer as a gaming experience. I liked deck-building mechanism for our cows to sell in train stations. Although it seems the effort for selling right comnbinations of cows to stations is not much rewarding, comparing other scoring elements.

A slow but adequate explanation of the game at Essen led to a slow but adequate 4 player game. Although it's quite fast to get back to your own turn it took us 2.5 hours to collectively get enough cows across the map to end the game. By the end most people had built all the buildings they needed and were mostly repeating the actions required to complete their challenge cards without much thought other than a bit of adding and subtracting small integers in order to ensure affording the next 5 turns.

This game is fine. There's nothing wrong with it at all, but it's also just not very exiting. Standard euro stuff really, some deck building, some engine building, multiple paths to victory. And I love euros, but this was just nothing special. You can't really plan more than a few turns in advance, and there's no interesting mechanical twists anywhere.

There is some interaction in how and where you build your buildings. It's pretty basic but it's there.

Everything scores points, and mostly there are a bunch of ways to turn money into points once you're done spending money setting up your engine. But a big source of points is in making it to Kansas City, especially later in the game once you're making better deliveries. But the game has a variable end and what ends up happening is some players will be in the exact right place to end the game and others will be half way through. You get one last action after someone else ends the game but if you can't make it to Kansas City on that action then you're probably not getting more than a few points with it. And the weird thing is it feels like there's little planning you can do to make sure you're with the pack.

And in general the randomness was a bit high (in addition to your card draw there's also the cow offer, the person offer, and the goal card offer). Probably in tolerable ranges if the game were more interesting but it's not.

This is a very thematic different sort of game.  You make maybe half a dozen trips along the trail to Kansas City to sell your herd of cow cards.  Along the way you visit a variety of buildings, either neutral and available to all or privately built and only for the owner, and perform a set of actions at the building.  When you sell your cows you get a lot of money, get vp, and unlock extra abilities on your board (like increasing cow hand size or more movement).  There are essentially three clear paths to victory, each requiring a different type of worker that you can hire: building buildings (craftsmen), buying better cows (ranchers), and moving your train to get to higher vp depots (engineers).  You can either dawdle at the buildings to use their actions or race through the journey to sell your cows more often.  This is a very strategy rich game with lots of options, especially with regard to the buildings you can place if you can set up a good combo.  I'm still wrapping my head around the ins and outs of this game but definitely can say I like it.

RATING: 7
Great Western Trail has a steep learning curve, partially due to an abundance of iconography and partially due to being somewhat unforgiving when making missteps. Work through those challenges and there's a game that provides a unique feel with a challenging tightrope to walk, forcing players to carefully time decisions on how much to build and how fast to travel based on how their opponents are playing. The game has a couple of blemishes (most notably how certain strategies such as buildings seem weaker than others), but it rewards frequent players with a varied, enjoyable challenge each game.

First impression is the designer appears to have been inspired by "Russian Railroads", though borrows from lots of other designs and seems blended together ok.  Game end a little unbalanced as it seems winning player is one who was able to make last delivery  after end game was triggered and anyone stuck on the "trail" is screwed (I hate to suggest variants after only one play but wonder if after end triggered anyone still left on trail goes directly to trail end and makes one last delivery?)

Initial Rating: 7.0 (June 2017)

I was very keen to play Great Western Trail. It seems I enjoy a lot Alexander Pfister´s heavy games (his lighter games not so much although I still haven’t played Oh My Goods!). I really liked Mombasa and I really liked Great Western Trail.

The rules of the game aren’t very complex, but there are many rules and icons to explain. You can explain the game under 28 minutes. When a friend was explaining the game, I thought it could be a What’s Your Game? game. Playtime is around 3 hours, so I strongly prefer to play it with 3 fast players. I won’t ever again play it with 4 players. With 4 players, the downtime and playtime is just too painful.

The game´s components and art are ok. The board is gorgeous and looks great on the table.

The theme doesn’t do anything for me, but it is ok.

The game´s decision are very interesting and each one matters a lot and has deep reaching consequences. In your turn, you must advance along the path and then perhaps do an action. At the beginning, moving is quick an easy, but later in the game there are a lot more buildings and obstacles and you have to pay money many times so planning how to move is key. Among the available actions you have: use a neutral building, your building or the auxiliary actions. You can get better cards, hire people (you have three options), build buildings, advance your train, build an station, get money, get better abilities on your player board or continue to advance during the trail. Many actions require you to play cards. Once you get to Kansas City you deliver your cows and you will be able to reach a city to get money and VPs. Doing this efficiently and quickly is not an easy task and solving this puzzle is very fun and rewarding. You have many paths to take and the best one isn’t obvious. I really like it.

There is some luck with the game (workers, hazards, teepees, draw of the cards), but I feel the best player will always win, that is, the luck factor can be controlled and the player that plans better will win.

Great Western Trail has a high replayability due to the buildings, they have 2 sides and they can be chosen at random as long as all players play with the same ones. There is also a random setup, so each game will be different.
 
It is a bit weird that the player´s boards are two player by default, it is usually the other way around. If you are playing a three or four player game you need to use additional tiles. Perhaps, it is Pfister´s way to tell us that GWT is best as a two player game, perhaps it is :D.

Bottom line, I really like Great Western Trail. It has very interesting options and many paths to victory. It is, definitively, a keeper among my game collection and a great strategy game. I really want to play it soon again.

My pick for best game of the Essen 2016 season.

Great Western Trail pulls some mechanics from Caylus (the variable building path that is partially player-constructed) and deckbuilders (the herd deck) but has a flavor all its own, with micro-turns, action chaining, and gameplay that is strategic as well as intricately tactical.  Once the players are familiar enough to randomize setup the game will literally never be the same for the first hundred plays or so, as there are 1024 different private building combinations in addition to the 28 different permutations for the general buildings.

Considerations include building such as to provide oneself meaningful action chains while placing stumbling blocks in the way of opponents, strategic decisionmaking in which type of worker is the focus (as well as a sub-branch for the engineers of focusing on station tiles or long train distance), and of course the usual deckbuilding, which is highly streamlined in itself but interlocks nicely with the rest of the system.

Great Western Trail is more generally accessible than the designer's other well-regarded game Mombasa; there is no problem of similar upfront complexity to Mombasa's action selection and bookkeeper tracks.  This should keep the playtime under 2.5 hours once the players are skilled, while Mombasa for all its greatness still struggles to get under 3 hours.

Questions have arisen in my local group whether bad hand draws can put a player irrevocably behind.  I don't know for myself whether I find this truly concerning yet - I've had good luck and mediocre luck but not the truly horrendous hands my opponents have experienced, so I don't have much firsthand perspective on playing around bad draws.  Until I've played out that side of a game, I'm not sure how I'll feel about the hand-draw randomness.

- Wow. Soo much going on here. Many different strategies to pursue, and sweet action/building combinations.
- Heaps of variation and replay-ability. Very little randomness.
- This is the type of game where you want to do everything but can only do a little, so you have to be focused. Which is hard because everything is so good.
- Not much player interaction, but you need to pay attention to what everyone is doing as it does affect your decisions.
- Setup and tear-down takes quite a while, which can't really be avoided.
- Teaching is a drag, but worth it.
- Recommend 2-3 players. 4 players extends the game and slows it down, but is still fun.

After having played a few times now... my rating has gone up.  There are many ways to victory.  Originally I thought that Cowboys/Cattle was the best, but a building strategy almost beat me in one game.  I have now seen an Engineer strategy that concentrated on building stations, too (it really took me by surprise how well it played)

The game scales quite well for three or four (I have yet to play with only two) and the strategies can be quite different when random buildings are used and certain actions become scarce.  I think that a house rule to use opponents buildings (at a considerable cost) might help.

Game speed is determined by the players.  It can go really fast if auxiliary actions are few, or it can drag on and on if players try to maximise their VPs early.  

There's almost too much to grasp, but I think that four players is the sweet spot for this game.

One of the highlights of Essen '16.

I feel a bit like a fanboy on this one. I thought, "how good could this game really be?" It's really, really, good. Pfister really designed a solid game. You have a little bit of card drafting and hand management, rondel, and a bit of engine building. A lot of things are going on in this one. Theme is great. Plays good at minimum and maximum count. Layout can really make this a brain burner, but it can also be changed to let new players learn without the burn. This game is a keeper. Great experience with this one.

Just one 2 player game, but I am already confident that this is a keeper. Not quite as challenging as Mombasa, but every bit as much fun. This is by far the best game with a strong deck building component that I have played. 

Now 6 plays in, including a couple of 4-player games, and I am still loving this game. It is surprisingly interactive, and I really appreciate how little I find myself thinking about points (thinking more thematically instead) as I play.

After 20+ plays, this game is still excellent. One of the best!

I think this game takes a lot of great modern ideas in Euro-boardgaming and melds them together quite successfully in a way where the game is more than just a sum of it's mechanisms.  It's only subtly interactive and you can get a little screwed by the randomness of the draw, but it's full of difficult and interesting decisions that won't be the same from one game to the next, and there exist wildly different strategies to try out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like how this game implements many different elements of different mechanics: worker placement (moving to buildings), deckbuilding (cows), set collection, area placement (both in terms of buildings and railroads, and even a bit of railroad play.  It all comes together in a nice package with a cool theme.  The only thing that prevents this from being a 10 is the length.  This is a LONG game.  Most games don't print the gameplay length on the side of the box longer than 2 hours, this has 2.5 hours as the long end of the range, and that's short.

RATING: 8
GWT offers a circular, rondel-esque action structure that players build with action tiles as the game progresses. While the trail of actions is one way, it always ends in a delivery of cattle and then starts over again. Players cycle through about 5-7 times before the end conditions are met.

The structure of the game is simple and once you get going the game plays fast. However, there are a lot of options and a lot of symbols to learn, so the game may appear a little daunting at first. While there are many ways to get points, there are few key sources where the majority of points will come and how you choose to focus on these areas is the key to doing well. Players are managing and improving a deck of cattle cards that represent their herd. Building your herd and managing your hand to optimize cattle deliveries is one source. Another is advancing your train to better and better stations. Putting out more of your buildings (action spaces) is another possible source. And another source is gaining and playing goal cards. There are a number of other secondary ways to collect points. If you balance your focus between all of the main sources, you are unlikely to do well. As with a lot of these games, the key is optimizing your decisions to primarily support one or two of these sources while keeping an eye on your opponents and hindering them when you can.

While at first glance a mechanical mish-mash, Pfister has done a very good job of melding the various elements into a cohesive whole.

(Reminder to pick up fixed tile when Stronghold makes it available...)

Combination of tile placement and deck building to get your cows to Kansas City
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Easily the best of the 2016 releases that I have played thus far -- rating based on 8 plays in less than two weeks after first sight (first four plays with a borrowed copy at EuroQuest convention).  I really like this Alexander Pfister design which captures the theme of the Old West with some really smooth and elegant game mechanics that make an appealing game.  First, there's the worker market that also works as a game-timing device -- brilliant design featue.  Then, there is the cattle market where you can add better cards to your deck based on number of cowboys you recruited.  Also, there is the unlocking of special abilities on your board each time you deliver to Kansas City and/or move your train to a special location.  The placement of buildings on the trail heralds back to that early worker placement game, Caylus; and then there's the deck-building aspect of Dominion added to a very intriguing board game.  Some have also made the analogy to some of Mac Gerdts' rondel games, which is mimicked by the important player decision as to how quickly to proceed during each "lap" down the road to Kansas City.  As a result, this game has quickly moved to the top of my list of best new games for 2016.  There's almost endless replayability due to a variable combination of available player buildings and random neutral building layouts.

I don't give out 9s lightly, but this game deserves such a high rating.  I enjoy the theme and interlocking mechanics in this one better than the award-winning Mombasa by the same designer.  Definitely better than games like Scythe and Terraforming Mars, which seem to be getting more love on BGG right now.  Hopefully, that will change as more people get to try this challenging game.

OK, second time re-rating this game, upping to the extalted status of a "10" -- it's clearly the best new boardgame since Puerto Rico in 2002, at least in my book.

There are lots of options and things to learn. The interplay between the different strategies is interesting and how many people are pursing each changes the dynamic quite a bit.

There is player interaction, mostly in the form of "I bought this so you can't". Building buildings on the board is the other main source of player interaction, which is more nuanced than it may seem at first. Your buildings might cause opponents to pay a toll to move through, but they also slow them down. Different strategies need to visit Kansas city more frequently so buildings also offer a way to manipulate the effectiveness of the various strategies.

The game has a lot of little rules but they all hang together well and a single turn is a very simple affair. Move, activate building, draw. The devil is in the details of the actions on buildings. Turns are also surprisingly fast leading to a very smooth game flow. Things slow down a bit when someone reaches Kansas city, but even that only takes about 20 seconds.

Lots of people at the con had concerns about play length. My games were not overly long. The first was 2.5 hours and the second was 2 hours, both with 4 players. The first had all new players and the second had 3 new players. So I didn't experience the game dragging at all, but that is a common complaint so if you have AP issues in your group perhaps this one will drag. 

I'm very interested in playing this more. There's lots to learn about how to play well and I like that. I have yet to see someone build the really expensive buildings. The game allows you to focus on one area or to diversify and I think all sorts of approaches are valid, the question is: which will work best given the game state and what your opponents are doing?

This and [gameid=177736] are the two heavy euro gaming behemoths of Spiel 2016. Be prepared to spend 1 hour per player on its first outing. Even after one play I'm reluctant to replay it if some of the players need a rules explanation. When I reentered the hobby almost ten years ago, heavy euros like Amun-Re or Brass needed far less explanations. Vinhos et al. have set a disturbing trend. Not that Great Western Trail isn't worth it. In the opposite; it's a good, potentially very good game. I just wish that it had a bit less overhead.

At its heart is a board that essentially is a huge developing rondel from which players choose their action. I initially had the impression that the development of the board was inspired by Caylus but William doesn't think so. Another essential system is the deck-building and the ensuing hand management. Furthermore, players have to improve their personal boards Hansa Teutonica-style. Three principle strategies are available to aim for: cattle, locomotive, building (in ascending sophistication/difficulty). The good news is that mixed strategies seem to be feasible as well as long as the player manages to squeeze out benefits a bit more efficiently from the game systems.

I only played its predecessor Mombasa once. My impression is that Great Western Trail is a more focused design while Mombasa had more player interaction.

Two kinds of interesting engine building (buildings on the board, deck building / winnowing), plays really smoothly, and has about the right level of interaction for a game like this.

How is it possible to make such an ugly box cover? I'm less than impressed with the smart and dynamic gameplay. It surely is a splendidly sleek engine builder with a bit of a dynamic deck builder thrown in the mix and there are many approaches to take. But in the end it is dull, long and a tad repetitive optimization adventure. The deck builder part also brings with it an unfortunate card lottery element. And on top of all this it feels very unthematic that having some buildings around makes moving around on the prairie slower. I could play again if the other players are guaranteed to be quick.

I expected a lot from this game, and was disappointed. The game is made of 5-6 cool mechanisms, but is less than the sum of its parts.

Pretty interesting euro. How viable a strategy is really depends on the other players.
In that vein, this is perhaps the euro where hindering your opponent is most prevalent since... Caylus? Yeah, it can be rather petty and mean. Well, it's never fatal or really painful so we'll stick to "petty".

Not a fan of the theme. Artstyle is also rather meh. Excellent graphic design though.

I haven't played enough to really judge but so far it seems like some strategies just aren't viable or simply underpowered. If the game makes you work more to get less in return, why bother?

I want to try a building focused strat (I'm fond of building in euros) but only feel confident in giving it a shot with less experienced players.

OK so, I'm going to be in the extreme minority in this one, but here it goes...

Extremely modern board game.  Tons of choices, tons of paths, figuratively and literally.  Bunch of differnt actions, bunch of ways to score points.  Very minimal randomness.  All great things - BUT - I might never play this one again.

The game took well over 4 hours not including teaching/learning.  The iconography on the board is so small and funky that everyone has to stand up every turn to see everything, or ask closer players "what does that space do?, OK what does the next space do, OK what does the next space do, OK I'll do that."

I love Broom Service, I love Isle of Skye I was really looking forward to getting this one played, but I was ultimately disappointed.

2017-04-21 - 7 - Quite a lot of mechanisms, which works pretty well with each other and the game is not as overwhelming as it appears. Unfortunately they are not as connected with theme as I would like them to be. Deckbuilding, as in every game, makes no sense thematically, but it is only some part of the game. I like GWT, you can pursue many paths to victory (trails even!), but for most of the game you are not interested what others do. I prefer games with stronger interaction. Anyway I will gladly play it again as after getting know the rules and few turns the gameplay runs pretty smoothly.
We played the first game for two hours, even slightly longer and the game didn't feel long, which is a good sign.

2017-10-21 - 7->8 - I played again and I really enjoyed it! For its weight the turns can run really quick. It's a really good eurogame with low interaction, which is not my favourite genre, but from time to time I like to play such a a game and GWT is one to consider in such a case.

Alexander Pfister games have been a big hit for me over the last couple years, Broom Service and Mombasa rank among my favourites and Port Royal is a favourite filler. So I definitely had high expectations for Great Western Trail, even though I lost horribly on my first play the game hit the right notes with the strategic planning and brisk pacing. It's a game that really rewards dabbling in all the scoring options while focusing on one main route to score points, the scoring is very diverse so you can't ignore aspects of the game (as I found out in my first game). The teaching is a bit involved and can take about 20–25min to introduce players, but after a few rounds the turns speed up. But even though the turns are pretty quick, the game is pretty long, with three players it's about the perfect length for a medium-heavy Euro, with 4 it becomes longer than Mombasa. In terms of gameplay, there are lots of moving parts in this game and juggling trying to make the most of each action spot as well as trying to get the perfect hand of cows to deliver by the end of the 'rondel' of the trail is great. The drawing of cows at the end of your turn really is the best part of the game though!

A really good strategy game and for me One of the best game I ever played.  The card and board artworks are great too.

The game is heay ( but not very heavy ) but surely has many mini games in the game itself.  In this game we must find a way to score high VP in all areas. 

Very entertaining,  but also very AP prone. Played this for more than 4 hours ( with 4 players) because we miss 1 or 2 rules.

Whilst you will have a general game strategy, each turn you can only do a limited amount as you can only move a limited number of spaces, do actions on the space you stop at and re-fill your hand. As your moves will be relatively unaffected by other players you can plan your move whilst you wait, minimising the time it takes to do your go. Biggest negative is there's no catch-up mechanic if someone is a run away leader.

It has a lot of things going on, but it is not as complicated as it first may seem. The gameplay is rather interesting and, in my opinion, it has a fair amount of player interaction for a eurogame. Setup takes some time and it has a large footprint on the table.

My balls literally exploded playing this ultramegaoverhyped game.
Rules not clear. You see indians and disaster and you know it has no sense at all going that way (at least in 2). You do for three hours always the same thing. You constantly check the rules to understand "what happens if". Maybe I'll play it again in 3-4 but I'm afraid the game will last 4-5 hours.

I had a high expectations for this, because previous years Mombasa was a big hit. Unfortunately Great Western Trail isn't that great design. Again, many rules to learn (like in Mombasa), but the mix of different kind of mechanisms isn't that interesting. Yes, definitely ready to play again anytime, but if I have to choose right now between this and Mombasa, Mombasa would be my choice.

This is a boilerplate, theme-less Eurogame with very little to distinguish it from the many other titles out there.

Not a bad game at all, but extremely overrated.

RATING: 7
This one is quite over-hyped and over-rated.  Not a bad game, but my least favorite from this designer.  Mechanics are interested and the turn marker track with the people to hire is extremely clever.  Sadly, the game essentially plays the same every time and gets old after just a couple plays.  The deck building mechanics is necessary but uninteresting (a cow is a cow is a cow) and interaction between players consists of mildly competing for persons/cows/stations and blocking each other with buildings, which simply isn't that interesting.  I'm sure fans will disagree but balance doesn't seem spectacular, with cowboys being a must and builders being the weakest path.  A bit like Orleans, this game gives the illusion of multiple paths to victory but that all really fall apart once you play with a strong player who really knows what to do to optimize his score.

Reminds me of some major elements from Egizia and Russian Railroads.  It is fiddly Euro with lots of interesting combinations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Uncertain what to think after the first play. It feels a bit overwhelming fiddly at first although it does come together quite quickly and plays fairly simply. Watch out for powerful building combos. This is a deckbuilding game and one likely should aim to trash their junk cards quickly - the person who did that the most quickly ran away with the game. We found it challenging to change the pace of the game - tried to move ahead and change the pace a couple times but was flummoxed when opponents played a contract card allowing a double move action. Uncertain where I currently stand on this one - part of me thinks it is interesting, but trashing cards might prove to be a one trick pony that everyone has to do in order to compete? Too frequently, this is the bane of deckbuilders...or just a way of life with deckbuilders.

Ein Spiel das mir sehr gefällt! Deckbuilding und Aktionsmanagement.
Jeder Spieler erhält ein gleiches Deck an Karten von denen er am Zugende auf sein Handlimit aufzieht, wenn er denn Karten ausgespielt hatte.
Im Spiel läuft man den Trail entlang um auf Häusern zu landen und dort Aktionen auszuführen, wie z.B.: neue Häuser bauen, neue Karten fürs Deck aus dem Viehmarkt kaufen, Handkarten ausspielen um Geld zu erhalten, und und und.
Am Ende des Trails ist das Ziel, so viele unterschiedliche und hochwertige Karten auf der Hand zu haben, wie möglich. Jede doppelte Karte zählt 0. Dafür erhält man Geld und Siegpunkte. Wer am Ende am meissten von letzterem hat gewinnt.

Das Spiel geht etwas lange. Wenn man weiss was man tut dauert es wesentlich kürzer, zieht sich aber gegen Ende trotzdem, weil der Trail sich durch Bau von Häusern verlängert und man zwanglläufig länger braucht um ans Ziel zu gelangen.
Mir gefällt das Spiel dennoch sehr gut. Es gibt etliche Möglichkeiten seine Ziele zu erreichen. Man kann auf Bahnhofsbau gehen, wofür man Geld und Zugstrecken braucht, oder man dünnt sein Deck aus um schnell an Geld zu kommen, verschifft dann aber sehr Effektiv seine Rinder zu hochwertigen Städten, es gibt Auftragskarten die man erfüllen kann, Häuser bauen und sich eine gute Engine überlegen, und und und...
Mir hats gefallen, auch wenn es etwas kürzer sein könnte (dann hätt ich aber mein Deck nicht komplett ausdünnen können... gewonnen habe ich trotzdem nicht, sondern Mr. Bahnhofsstrategie...)

RATING: 6
The game is exciting and varied, and also plays well with two. The players drive their flock from Texas to Kansas City, where the cattle are then delivered to distant cities by train. Each city can only be delivered once, so you have to plan well and you have to move your 'railhead' forward in time to avoid extra costs. The value of your hand with cows cards must also match the value of the city you deliver, otherwise your cows will go to lesser destinations with some penalty points. You increase the value of your hand by adding new, expensive cows to your herd and paying off in good time. During the trip from Texas to Kansas City you can visit general buildings to perform actions such as selling cows, recruiting cowboys, workers and engineers, building your own buildings at locations along the 'Trail', buying new, expensive cows that deliver a lot and increase your reach on the track. When you deliver a city or station, you place a sheet of your tableau at that location. As a result, you unlock an 'action improver' that allows you, for example, to hold more maps or to travel on your journey to the Kansas City delivery point, where the herds depart by train to their final destination. During the game the players make 5 to 7 trips to Kansas, allowing them to visit their buildings several times to use the advantage there. Great Western Trail is exciting and offers many tactical possibilities. The own buildings are two-sided: an easy and a difficult side. Although it seems complex, the game easily plays away and continues to fascinate time after time. However, there are better western games I think

GWT looks great and plays great. The actually turn mechanism is utter simple. Just move your marker, but planning everything out, accounting for what others have done to the board and trying to eek out every last victory point really makes your gear grind. I LOVE IT!

In Great Western Trail, you are a cattle rancher, driving your stock from Texas to Kansas City. You have to get them through hazards, do some canny cattle trading along the way, hire hands to manage the stock, and hope for a big payday once you get to the end of the trail!

And you build buildings. You make buildings or towns or something along the way, because that's what cattle ranchers did, they built towns and such and hired workers to help build them. I guess? Look, just focus on the cattle drive for the moment. We need to get to Kansas City!

And build a railway. Because the goal of a cattle drive was to go to a city that didn't have a railway and construct one. And along the way you'd traditionally build stations, which you could then man with your train engineers, builders, or cowboys. Cowboys were all the time leaving the profession in order to become station agents. Look it up.

In addition to these tasks that your basic ranchers had to perform, they would also create and then clean up hazards, trade with natives, and manage an employment office. The life of the average rancher was full of diverse responsibilities.

What I'm trying to say here is that GWT is a thoroughly modern board game trading on the latest trend: more is more. Why merely put the players in a single, well-defined, approachable role when instead they can play as, I don't know, "The Spirit of the Western Frontier" or something. Why give a clear goal -- you're looking to make your fortune driving beeves to market -- when you can instead provide ELEVEN different scoring categories to sum up? Why give a bonus for trading with natives when you can have two different kinds of natives for no reason other than more natives is better? Why make a game that can be taught and learned easily when you can instead add unnecessary wheels and levers and gears in the name of "depth"? 

There's a good and interesting game hidden inside of GWT, but it's buried under a lot of -- well, there's a thematic element I could say it's buried under, but why commit to a theme now? Instead you're given a myriad of options and paths, but no method for really exploring any of them. If you're trying to do the thing the game is ostensibly about -- sell cows -- you're going to want a lot more hand/deck management than you're allowed. If you want to build buildings, you have to make a lot of money, which means you have to sell cows as well. If you want to run a railroad, that's great, but you're going to have to do other things to score some points. And of course the objective cards want you to do a little of everything because focus? We don't need no stinkin' focus.

I'd like to really like GWT, but like so many current board games, it collapses under its own weight. So much incoherent nonsense has been added in that playing the game is less fun than frustrating, mostly because you're not competing against the other players but against the design of the game. Too many times it wasn't other players that were my issue (at least not by their intention) but because the game was asking me to do something convoluted that required the precise alignment of stars to get right. 

An editor with a red pen could have made this into a really great game. Instead we got yet another flavor of the week puzzle box that will be long forgotten when the next such game comes out. It'll get bought, learned, played a couple times, then hang out on a shelf for the rest of its life, constantly getting passed over because, "I don't even remember how to play that."

RATING: 7
Initial impressions: Wow what a well designed games. Like most modern euros it is a hodge podge of mechanics, but here outside of some of the set collection the hodge podge makes thematic sense. The deckbuilding ties into the managing your herd, the hand management that different towns want different types of cows, the time track that you must drive your cattle to new pastures to feed, the different action buildings that are you are making business contacts with settlements along your journey, etc. The idea of the rail track is thematic and that some cities will only accept higher value cows, but that you can only deliver to each city once not so much. Similarly it makes sense you would be rewarded for removing hazards on a route, but that you just pay money to do so is clearly just for the sake of mechanisms. 

It seems like you will be pretty lost your first few games as the different mechanisms interact in strange ways. I learned I was moving too quickly through the time track without delivering enough quality cows, which cost me greatly. The game also punishes mistakes somewhat harshly. However, it seems like there are quite a few different point scoring options you can pursue, as while you still have to do a little of everything, you can still get a different bulk of your points from different methods. I'm a little afraid if I ever get to that level of expertise the game may still feel a bit too arbitrary since the scoring is arguably the least thematic aspect of the game, but that probably is along ways off into the future, as different starting map configurations I would assume really change up the game.

This is my number 1 game of all time....I love to play this game!....I love the replayability because of the random setup of the standard building tiles. It really changes the strategy as you always have to think about having money to do what you want as money is pretty tight in this game. Also I often play 2 players and it's great, but love playing at 4 players, feels like a completely different game with different player counts.

This game is compelling, but not wowing. That being said, I'm definitely looking forward to more plays. I'm a fan of this designer (thanks to Mombassa, not so much Isle of Skye).

Artwork is well done, especially the board.
In Great Western Trail the playerboards are crap.
(Scythe has best player boards at all, every game should have those)
It is a nice cute game.

At 2/3 of the game, i was only pushing the workers to end the game.
I would recommend this game at least with 3-4 players only, but playtime would be a bit long.
So many things to do, to get points.
In my opinion, buildings, cowboys with the cows (card) as resource is a nice part of the game.
However, the train stations and so on doesn't fits to that western game and change a bit the charm of GWT.

A light deck building game where you try to move cattle from Texas to Kansas City and then to points west.  You can move on a board gathering cattle cards and building businesses along the trail.  You also move your train further west to get discounts on delivery costs or bonuses.  

The game is incredibly fun. I have found that I really like Alexander Pfister's heavier euros.  Isle of Sky was not that interesting but Great Western Trail is the best game of 2016.  

It plays in a reasonable amount of time and has a lot of interesting decisions.  Excellent graphic design, solid artwork and great theme.  This may crack my top ten after more plays.

I don't deny that [b][thing=193738][/thing][/b] is a great game, but I just can't get that excited when playing it.  As [person=11767]Pfister[/person] games go, I think I still prefer [b][thing=172386][/thing][/b].  Although [b][thing=193738][/thing][/b] allows different strategies and even encourages specializing in some and ignoring others, which is something I generally enjoy, I find the "rondel" mechanism inhibits and even frustrates specialization because there are so few opportunities each time down the path to take the action related to one's plans.  And so I get distracted and do other things.  (Yes, I'm not very disciplined.)

Great game - Each player has a there own deck made up of cows with a colour and a value - Follow the trail from building to building using the ability on the building to either build your own buildings or hire staff (cowboy - helps you buying new cows, builder - helps with buildings and engineer - helps move your train)- when you reach the end of the trail add up the value of each unique cow in your hand - that value is how far you can travel down the train tack to sell your cattle. Its also how much you earn minus certain points on the track from where your own train is. then move you guy back to the beginning of the trail and do it all again - Each player has his own board each time you either sell cattle of move to a station you can remove disks from your board which will allow you to unlock certain abilities - like increase hand size or increase movement etc etc

Tentative rating after 2 plays (7.5): Very straightforward to play (once you get a grasp of the icons).  Turns are quick.  I tend to be a little bit picky when it comes to medium to heavy euros games.  I really only want a handful of great ones in my collection so I can play them over and over.  Still to be determined if this can offer the same amount of enjoyment as Concordia, Puerto Rico, or Hansa Teutonica.  Plan to play this several times more before making any sort of real decisions about its longevity.  I enjoyed it more than Mombasa.

Update after 3 plays (7): The 3rd play didn't excite me so I decided I was done with it.  A lot of newer medium to medium-heavy euros seem to be flopping with me.  Tired of games that try to throw too many mechanisms together.  Never feels truly compelling too play.  They lose a lot of luster & depth once you 'figure' out how all the different mechanisms work together.  

I love Port Royal and Broom Service, but Isle of Skye, Mombasa, and Great Western Trail just didn't offer enough enjoyment to keep in my collection.

Nice theme and production values, decent player interaction, board/tech upgrades like Hansa Teutonica (and terra mystica, and eclipse, and scythe etc.), objective cards like ticket to ride.  A polished game.

I really like this game. I would love to play this game more and figure out all of the little intricacies. Whenever I play this game, it is with beginners, so I usually cut out parts of the game that could cause an overload of information for a new player. The mechanics are good, but most players agree that the train is a little abstract.

No, I'm sorry I know everyone loves it but it's just too damn convoluted.  The train spaces are so terribly marked it caused a lot of confusion and the fact that the design seems to railroad everyone into the same play- I mean it was a struggle for money in the same place every turn and nobody ever seeemed to get ahead.  It just seemed like everything by design is to screw you as much as possible which only served to make the game super stressful because even when things went well it screwed you on the next item.  It's possible that with more knowledge of the board and being able to set yourself up (by buildings) to have money at critical points (after losing it all 3x as you proceed through) would be.  The monopoly style player tax for crossing properties was just a little too much- in all it just seemed too hard, and not a good hard that was challenging to overcome, just a bad hard that continued to punish your in the same way every time around the board.  I'll play it again now that I know some stuff but I came away with more stress than I think I ever have from trying to play a game and can't say I'm looking forward to it.

Good game. But too repetitive, too point-salady and maybe too much randomness in a 2.5 hour game (4p). A lot to think about and keeping track of but not a lot of interesting decisions.

Jó cucc. De túl repetitív, túl pontsalátás és talán túl random a 2,5 órás hosszához képest (4fős). Agyalós, sok mindent kell számon tartani, de kevés érdekes döntési helyzet adódik.

Potential to go up.  I'm really digging this one.  It's complex up front, but it all comes together about halfway through your first play.  I read comments about the game dragging on and becoming samey...and I just don't see that.  I have to assume those comments may have been based on convention plays.  It's a very unique game that feels very different from play to play.  We've attempted quite a variety of strategies, and they always seem competitive.  The game is complex enough, however, that I don't see how it could ever be solved.  Really digging this one. 

Edit:  better with every play

I usually don't like games with this much of a sandbox feel, but this one has me both mesmorized and frustrated, in a good way. I really don't know whether to go heavy cattle, heavy train, heavy building, or a little bit of everything. I don't know whether to rush to KC or take my time. I basically have no clue what I'm doing, but keep finding myself eager to play again to learn a new trick or two.

--------------------

Some stuff we did wrong in our first few games:

You only get a single auxiliary action at someone else's building or at a hazard/teepee, not a double.

You don't draw back to your hand limit until Phase C (could impact options for buildings with movement).

Multiple people can have a disk at a single train station. Also, you don't have to be station master and take the tile while giving up a worker. You might just want to clear off a disk to gain a perk on your personal board.

The permanent purple shares you can earn from station master tiles are separate from the temporary ones marked with the cube on your player board.

The woods private building tile pays $2 for each of your private tiles in the woods, not just tiles with that icon.White disks can go anywhere, black disks go on black spaces only.You may discard objective cards via the draw/discard action (available as auxiliary and on some building tiles).

Update: up .5, but still it takes long for what it is. 

Solid game but a bit dry and solitary. Points to be gotten everywhere, but building a herd (deck) of valuable cows seems to be the most important. I had expected a more exciting game, more interactive etc. I was missing the fun factor a bit. But then again I am a spoiled old gamer I guess, with high demands. But I will give it more tries and update later.

I'm really loving this game.  While I'm generally not a fan of the point-salad model and to some degree this game does just feel like a mash-up of numerous game mechanisms, it combines a number of things I really enjoy and just seems to pull it off in a way that delights me.  The theme is fantastic and well-integrated, the deck-building is simple and enjoyable, the trail system offers very compelling choices, and the wide variety of strategies for maximizing points allows for a unique approach to each play.  This game is a bit of a beast to teach, but I've thoroughly enjoyed each play and love that every single turn provides me with interesting choices and tense decisions.

This is an absolutely fantastic and engaging game. You are moving your cows on a trail to Kansas city, stopping along the way to manipulate your herd (hand of cattle cards), hire helpers, building buildings, buying more prestigious cows, trading with natives, clearing hazards, expanding your rail line and so forth. Whenever you get to the end of the trail you sell and ship off your cows, which earns you money of course, but also unlocks/upgrade abilities on your player board.

This is a game that takes a few hours to play usually, but I'm utterly engaged the whole way and it doesn't feel like that much time has passed. I'm engaged in every single aspect of the game, there are so many different paths you can take, different things you can focus on, and I just love it. One of my favourites.

Played it 2p and 3p, it seems to work perfectly at every player count (i want to play it 4p as well!).
The amount of viable strategies is amazing, a quite simple ruleset and a lot of depth! The rondel-style board is extremely interesting, and I have never seen a deck building where it is so easy to thin your deck! (I managed to have a hand-size deck without draw-pile, probably I committed to much to it, but it was insanely fun!)

Wow, this game took freakin' forever, doing the same thing over and over. The theme was total crap. The rules were such a mess it made quick lookup impossible. The basic ideas are fine but they are so convoluted as written as to make it seem so much more difficult. I was praying for unconciousness after four hours. The idea of herding Holsteins accross the plains is just ludicrous.  Looks like the author decides he wanted to Feldify his game and gave you freakin' points for every damn thing under the sun, including points for mercifully ending the game.  That in itself should have been worth 20 points.

Not a bad game at all. Different interlocking things like deck building and sort-of worker placement. Not too attracted to the point-salady aspects.

Excellent execution of a rondel system in a board game. I love how you can build up you options as you move around the board as the game matures. Like many of my favorite games there are many paths to victory and i have indeed found my favorite strategy. I am definitely trying to get this to the table but my reason why i don't is also one of my negatives about this game. This game is a bit rough to teach. I feel this is one of those game in which you need to touch on every rules before you begin. I have found that skimming over a small rule or two has a big impact on a newer player at last some pint in the game, some times its a fatal mistake they cannot recover from. So all in all I love this game but I always do not want to teach it. If i don't have to teach its definitely getting to the table.

Heaviest Pfister yet, and superior to Mombasa. The way he's weaved deckbuilding, power unlocking, board building, endgame scoring, etc., etc., is genius. There are definitely multiple paths to victory here but the real sweet spot is managing your route with strategically placed and ordered buildings for optimal actions. Very clever and happy to play.

This is quickly turning into one of my favourite games. I love the juggle between the three staff (Cow Farmer, Master Builder and Train Guy) and their associated strategies, and figuring out the best balance between the three. There's a nice amount of player interaction for a Euro, and a reasonably strong theme. I think it plays better with three than two, though.

Excellent game which seems very intimidating in the beginning but after a couple of rounds everything starts to flow in a natural way. Gameplay is really solid with a combination of different mechanics that I do like a lot: set collection, deckbuilding, route/network, worker placement, railroads... it all fits together and thematically, it also makes sense. Only downside is the long play time: our first play got finished after 3,5 hours with 3 players but it never seemed to drag or wear down. I wouldn't play with 4 based on this info though. Trying to get this played with my wife or oldest son.

Got in a few more plays (with fewer than 4 players) and am really getting into this game. If offers a million ways to win but doesn't feel like point salad. The various worker types (Engineer, Craftsman, Cowboy) are all distinct and interesting, almost like three games wrapped up into one. Long-term strategy is really important but there's also a lot of flexibility, allowing you to shift away from a strategy that isn't working out. Especially near the beginning of the game, there's the constant question of, "Do I have to stop here, or should I skip it to get to Kansas City faster?" (For income and upgrades). There's also something satisfying in getting into a rhythm, with certain locations that are very important for your strategy. But you still have to adapt and evolve that strategy as new buildings are placed as well as consider what's in your hand. Fairly simple rules but a lot of complex interactions.


OLD REVIEW:
Need to play this again, but I ended feeling that the elements didn't really fit together in a way that made sense to me. There are so many interesting elements, from the deck building to the personal upgrades. Yet it didn't seem clear when one action was better than another. Probably just need more experience to understand it better.

Wow, GWT almost beat my favourite euro Tzolkin. Very simple in the mechanics, but with lotsa depth. Move your rancher up to 3 places (more if you upgrade), and that's it. What amazes us is the game is super thematic, all the actions makes sense for us, it clicked after 3 moves, but super strategic in gameplay. Multiple path to victory which seems balanced, and all are interesting to try. The variability is there thanks to the 2 sided building (with suggested randomization in the rulebook) and random seeded board. Takes a bit too long, which is why Tzolkin is my prefered game, but tbh I did not notice it as we were engaged in the game the entire time. Great game for euro afficionado!

Finally an Alexander Pfister game I like! That isn't to say that this is one of my favorite Euros ever or anything, but I do think it's his best design yet.

There's some Euro junk rattling around, however. The game feels a bit like a kitchen sink design, and I think that some parts of it could have been cut out, despite all feeling connected to the theme. I think the game is pretty long for what it is, and after awhile the progression of the game slows to a crawl.

That all being said, I really like the way the Rondel is utilized here. Being able to build locations along the route to Kansas City, and choosing whether or not they are tucked behind obstacles is very interesting. The deck building element, while fairly minor, feels pretty fresh. I also like the various strategies to pursue, but again, the game is so long that it doesn't feel like you're agonizing over which actions to take. You have enough time to where you can pursue pretty much everything to some degree.

I do think that a second edition of this game with some further development could really make this into a classic. As it is, this is a fine Euro game that is surprisingly thematic. I wouldn't be opposed to playing again, but the length is a pretty big turn-off for me.

At first glance, Great Western Trail offers many interesting mechanics that blend very well. You have an action rondel that you can move through at your own pace. You have abilities to unlock and buildings to build to improve your actions. You have a hand of cards that you can optimize during the game to improve your sales. Some rules are a bit fiddly and convoluted but once you understand the flow, the turns are smooth and quick. All in all, you'll never find yourself out of interesting decisions during a game of Great Western Trail.

But in spite of being a game about getting your herds to the markets before your opponents, there is very little interaction in Great Western Trail. Everybody can sell in a city, everybody can build a station and everybody can use neutral buildings (but nobody else but you can use your own buildings). Why no fluctuating market prices? Why no shared infrastructure? Add to this the all too common point salad where you score for everything and you have a solitaire optimization game.

Great Western Trail is a solid game and I'd be happy to play it if asked but there is nothing that really makes it stand out.

GWT is an excellent game that reminds me in some ways of Scythe.  This is primarily from the player board in front of you that you try to clear in order to create more diverse and powerful actions.  From there, the game is all about collecting card sets of different cattle through deck building while navigating the midwest to drop your drive off at Kansas City and maximize points.  This game feels like a nice combo of a couple of other games/genres I enjoy while adding the building tile placement to make the game distinct.  A wild west theme, without a Cthulhu in site, is a nice variation for us as well.

After half a dozen or so plays, I am surprised that each game has revealed new strategies. The whole game is a series of relatively simple decisions, while having to balance the medium-term challenge of racing to Kansas or stopping everywhere, and the long-term of doing discs and collecting VP's. Very clever game design.

Regarding game play itself, there is generally little blocking, so you are usually ready with a move when it is your turn. Decisions increase smoothly as the game progress, and the end game is full of excitement, as the scores are obscured, and there will be cries of 'I didn't realise I was doing so well', or 'if only I had one more dollar at the end'. You can sometimes feel things aren't going your way, but this is sometimes a false assumption, and I've not seen players feel they can't catch up.

Some comments on what I think may discourage someone from trying the game. I have heard a lot of people complain that the theme is of no interest to them. This is by no means a thematic game, but it does tie all the elements of the game together, allows a few jokes/puns, and the game play is totally worth trying. Also, regarding the iconography, it certainly isn't familiar too many people. But I've found that after teaching the game and explaining the icons, everyone has 'clicked' with the icons, and no one has reported difficulty with legibility. One unusual aspect is how the money cost/reward is noted, but pointing this out early helps and all players have quickly adapted.

What's a great game !!
I have taught this game to 2 new players and they both play correctly and strategizes their play at the get-go. Both fully enjoy the gameplay and would love to play again soon. 

Regarding about strategy, I have played with cowboy fully loaded on my second game and it did pay off. However, I will update my thoughts on future plays where I employ different strategies.

This is another one of my favorites (even though I'm not a fan of the box art). It has different kinds of engines you can build, including a tableau, building  your own rondel, and a bit of deck-building. I was surprised at how well it all fit together.

Schönes Spiel mit solidem Western-Hintergrund. Das Thema ist gut getroffen und aus meiner Sicht stimmig umgesetzt. Die obligatorische Western-Eisenbahn kommt ebenso vor wie die rindertreibenden Cowboys und die Indianertipis (wenngleich letztere eher ein kleinerer Nebenschauplatz sind). Kurz: ein Spiel, das mir gerne nochmal auf den Tisch kommen kann.

A great game of interlocking mechanics that seems to overwhelm and consume but actually work really well together. The game encourages you to speed ahead at certain points and then to slow down to manage your herd (hand) and get the best possible result at the end of the round.

first impression, lukewarm. it had a solitaire feel. strange mixture of a game. while managing your deck of cards, you are going round and round a board, visiting buildings that enable you to build more buildings, pay for and acquire more cards, acquire helpers you put on your player board, advance your engine on a track, that allows you to develop your player board and also score endgame points, acquire tiles that score endgame points and acquire money. the elements are nicely meshed together, and provide stuff to think about and replayability. There is some competition for stations on the engine track, for better places to build on the board, for getting cheaper helpers and for higher value tiles, but there is always something to do and your actions seem incremental, I never felt, that if my opponents take something away I could lose, so did not need to keep a close eye on what they were doing. I do not like the deck building element and the somewhat repetitive nature of the game.

Con sommo dispiacere devo confermare che il gioco mi ha deluso. L'ho trovato piatto e noioso. Ripetitivo dall'inizio alla fine, si conta fino a 4, si piazza il proprio lavoratore, si esegue l'azione indicata sulla tessera e poi il turno passa al giocatore successivo. All'inizio si hanno pochi soldi, poche carte, pochi lavoratori e non si riesce a fare quasi nulla, più avanti si hanno un paio di opportunità in più.
La partita si trascina così per molto (troppo) tempo risultando lenta e a tratti boriosa.
Il tocco di grazia lo restituisce l'insalata di punti vittoria finale che determinerà, un po' a sorpresa, il vincitore del gioco.

Lets start with negative points. It has tons of rules. Sad but this become a a hard job to learn all rules exactly and play that kind of games correctly. We gave 2 and a half hour to learn game with one of my friend. We watched runthrough videos read all rules. Our brain burned. Still we did not get some rules clear. Maybe its our fault but game should help us. Yes, rulebook is clear has examples but too many pages too many rules too many details too many extra conditions. After 150 minutes of learning phase we spend another 150 minutes for playing in total of 300 minutes we learn and play this game. 5 hours. We were really tired after all. Game has many game mechanics combined. Card drafting, action selection, tile placement... But all these mechanics are too much I think. I think this game is more complex than its current complexity rate (3.72) it should be around 4, and its score (8.3) is soo much currently. There are tons of great games with less rules below this score. For example "Le Havre", "Stone Age", "Bora Bora" and "Calyus" even "Shogun". Sad but I think this way. Okay game is complex but of course I cannot say its so bad, I can play it again if I can find someone who wants to play it. 

Good sides are you can make long term plans and you can win with different strategies. I think game can have high replayibility because of this. Also theme is nice and it is mixed good with game. Game's card quality and artwork is good, game was cheap (35 Euros) compared to its components.

Okay this was my first play however if I can find a person to play it second maybe score can rise. However my friend will not probably play this again. He said he did not get fun because of game's heaviness. In overall I can play again but it has lots of complexity. I should not forget rules. In overall I give it 7. Its current rating 8.3 is so much for this game.

Have played several games now and each time I finish one game I immediately want to play another. The only unfortunate thing is that some setups along with randomization of things will make some strategies perform better than others. However, I don't think it takes away from the fun of trying out different things, just the efficacy.

My other complaint so far is that there just aren't enough choices in workers in 2-player games, and as such I much prefer 3/4 player (4 being my favorite so far, even with the over-competition for those railroad master tiles).

Everything else is awesome. Looking forward to playing more!

[b]Great Western Trail[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I don't really have much to say about Great Western Trail; I was excited to play and ended up being completely underwhelmed by the experience. In the end I found it to be a very mediocre experience that really didn't add anything to the game space it occupies [i](mid-weight Euros)[/i]. 

I found GWT to be a hodge podge of mechanics that felt completely disjointed without any cohesiveness. With some games that doesn't bother me, but I didn't enjoy the progression in GWT. The actions felt very similar from the beginning of the game to the end, with very little progression or engine building. I found the deck building aspect to be very disappointing; all I did was continually cycle through my deck on the way to KC in order to have a variety of different cows in my hand. On top of that the game never fought back, you could pretty much figure out a way to do what you wanted. I much prefer games that are nastier, for example I enjoy figuring out how to feed my family in Agricola.

I have little interest in playing GWT again or even trying Mombasa, but I really enjoy Pfister's lighter, family weight games [i](Broom Service, Isle of Skye and I'm excited to play Oh My Goods)[/i] so I'll just stick with those.[/i]

Un interesante euro de complejidad media-alta, con una combinación de mecánicas que da para todos los gustos. Podés trabajar tu mazo de ganado para aumentar su valor y abrir nuevos mercados, podés trabajar tu ferrocarril para llegar más lejos y más barato, podés construir edificios a lo largo de la ruta a Kansas para tener más acciones y cobrar peajes, podés comerciar con los indios o sacarlos a balazos de tu camino (aunque en ese caso los llamamos "peligros", a caballo, con pluma en la cabeza, pero no indios), podés mejorar tus habilidades en base a la experiencia de cada vuelta del viaje que hagas, o podés hacer todo eso a mismo tiempo, combinando un efecto con otro, si querés tener una chance de ganar.

Los turnos muy son cortos pero las opciones se complejizan rápidamente, y hay un elemento táctico en un tablero compartido que cambia constantemente o te da un pesito menos o un pesito más, que puede dar para algo de análisis parálisis.

Me hizo algo de ruido la gran diferencia en el funcionamiento de la engine del juego, entre el setup predefinido y el setup aleatorio. El predefinido fluye como una seda, armás combos y vez lucirse la magia. El aleatorio puede generar escenarios frustrantes de engines empastadas donde nada de esa maquinaria se luce. No estoy seguro cómo se podría asegurar un término medio para no comerse una partida que deje una mala impresión del potencial del juego para desenvolverse y enriquecer la experiencia. Jugar el setup predefinido solo es algo limitado. Tampoco escala bien. O mejor dicho, no escala.

En resumen, muy buena temática y producción, la engine no es un reloj suizo pero camina. Recomendable. No se si categoría "juego del año".

After 1 two-player game:

Rules - I read the entire rule book word for word (which I normally don't do, skipping the examples and detailed explanations of various symbols); on one hand I felt that it was necessary for me to really understand the game but at the same time the more I read the more excited I got so it was very enjoyable. In the end we forgot a few rules: replacing station master tiles with your own workers, moved our train to the delivery city during KC sub-phase 5, and chose where the hazard/teepees were placed rather than putting them in the lowest costing space. My method of teaching the rules was to first simulate how Kansas City works so they had an idea of what they were trying to achieve throughout the trail-phase. Then I picked up each neutral tile and explained the local actions and used this as a frame to explain the various other mechanisms like the cattle deck, job market, buildings, objective cards etc.


Gameplay - At two players it was fast paced and engaging. We are playing in tomorrow with 4 and I will update this review once we play. There were a couple times where I was struck with AP due to calculating how to rid myself of money in 2 turns so I wouldn't pay player 2 in the 3rd turn. I can see that there are a lot of strategies you could employ in this game that will depend on the toss of your tiles as well as how your rival ranchers will play as well. Lots of depth and strategic flow while limiting analysis. Interaction between players feels perfect; it's a cut-throat business but at the same time we're all just trying to survive.

Playtime - Took me 30 minutes to explain the rules. Another 2 hours to complete the game with two visits to the rulebook for clarification. With the same person I can easily see us wrapping this game up in just over an hour. Will edit this to comment on our 4-player game.

Theme - The theme is there but you do have to fill in the gaps I think in some places. The way you move your train while traveling through the trail but not when you actually get to Kansas City to deliver your cows is... odd? Maybe someone can explain it to me as I have never been into this genre. For this I have imagined that you are "laying down" your private railroad or rubbing elbows with the right people whenever you move your train forward. And then when you get to KC your connections (both physically and socially) can move you as far as x but after that you have to pay a freelance cowboy to take your cattle the rest of the way while you return to Texas. Other than that everything else seems great considering it's a euro.

Components - The wooden pieces are okay. The train and cattleman are adorable shapes. The board itself I personally really love. The trail feels treacherous yet beautiful. Everything is really clear on the board which I appreciate because sitting at on end of the table can make some symbols hard to see. The cattle cards are simply amazing.

Music Suggestion - We played the Red Dead Redemption sound track during this game and I would also recommend Nym's albums Convex and Warmblooded Lizard, maybe trim a song or two that don't fit). 

Overall - I love, love, love this game. Easily my top 10 games bu

Better than Mombasa, at least for two players.  I usually can't play games more than three times before I get bored of them but this one I can see going a little longer. Set up of building tiles will be in a different order every game and that is definitely what keeps it fresh.   Your game scores can vary wildly. Once I had 98 points and then the next game I only had 57. It all depends on the set up. Only downside is it's going to take a while to absorb all the icons so your early games are going to run at least 3 to 4 hours.  

Definitely could have used a player aid for icons because I was running through the rulebook back-and-forth looking for all sorts of little rules that were hidden in small bubbles. Had to print out a bgg icon aid.  It's also very easy to miss important rules like when you do actions on the tile, you don't have to do them in left to right order.  Played three games already with this rule wrong. 

After three games we have managed to get it down to 2 1/2 hours for two players,  but that doesn't include set up. Pfister has been hit and miss with me.  Really disliked Isle of skye,  got tired of Mombasa after three plays, love port royale. GWT is definitely my favorite of the lot.  The theme is nonoffensive this time compared to mombassa which I actually had trouble trading away because of people not being happy with the theme.  

The only other negatives I can really think of are the four side tracks on the board that lead to Indian teepees and through the hazards.   This seems like a wasted space. I really don't see the point of these and why you would be building in there since it's going to cost you a fortune to get through paying all the hazards to reach your building tile.  Last game I tried building on a hazard trail once.  I managed to reach my building tile one time for free, and after that there were 4 hazards showing up on the trail,  and the building was completely useless, even when only one hazard tile was there.. Hazards might be clear for a brief time but they quickly fill in again.   I also see limited use for craftsmen.  In all three games so far no one has ever gone over two craftsmen  or built more than three buildings.   The average is two buildings. They seem underpowered compared to cowboys and engineers.  Maybe this is one of those "hard to make it work" game mechanisms like in Mombasa when you try to use the book track.  That was one thing I found really jarring in mombassa. You had this fairly smooth game, and then you had the book track,  which presented a whole new area of excessive fiddlyness.

Update after three plays: down from 8 to 6.  Lost its luster. Game takes too long to play and weakness of the craftsmen strategy is not helping. Wife also doesn't care for it at all due to distaste for western theme, so it doesn't get played.

Solid design ...boy this guy is cooking ATM ...reminds me of an early Knizia ...
Why are Germans such great game designers ...my top five designers are all German weird!

Would have been a ten but unusually for this publisher the player boards are quite thin card ...and as the player board is quite important in this game I would have liked to have seen the player boards made from board ...

Not their normal standard I have come to expect ...

Played several times back to back as we enjoyed the experience so much plus wanted to explore as many ways to win as possible ...yet to find one over riding way of winning ...good balanced design !

Great Western Trail is another unique take on deck-building. Here, you start out with a hand of cows, and you move your pawn along a forking path, stopping at various buildings. By the end of the path, you hope to have as many different cows as possible in your hand, which you turn in for cash and other rewards, and then start the whole process again from the beginning of the trail. As the game progresses, players add more and more buildings to the path, which allows them to do more manipulation. Additionally, each player has a player board from which discs can be removed to reveal extra abilities, Hansa Teutonica-style. The game is certainly very unique, and has a lot of variability as well as strategies to explore. There is a bit of card draw luck, but on the whole I found the game pretty intriguing.

I'll have to come back to this game and actually rate and comment on it, but 2 players felt a bit loose. Not enough buildings and like 90% of the spaces were left open. I enjoyed it and it seemed tight enough, but it felt like it was missing something. I would love to try this with 3-4 players.

Superb presentation and very enjoyable gameflow. All the mechanics and scoring options are seamlessy integrated and feel thematic. Although many mechanics borrow from some earlier game, the game as a whole feels unique.

edit: after 7 plays: rating 9 -> 10, I just cannot get enough of this game. Gameplay is pure pleasure and replay value seems very high thanks to the variable setup.

A beautiful board, loads of praise, a lot of mechanisms and interesting choices. Or? Most of it is true, but the game feels weirdly scripted, the first few trips to Kansas City seem exactly the same, and all players seem to do the same actions. It just feels like the game is playing you, not the other way around. Somewhere in the middle it starts picking up, you have some better cows, and the deck building feels somewhat exiting, but the buildings and the train movement just feel flat. And then it ends. For a moderately long game (on average around 2,5 hours), the end just feels abrupt and anti-climactic. It's a hard thing to admit, because I expected to love this game, it's just not my idea of fun.

Positive points are that the rounds go quick, although the rules take some time to explain. It is beautiful, and the deck building is good after a while.

A great Euro style engine builder that seems simple on the surface yet the simplicity betrays a sincere depth. Multiple avenues of victory present themselves without any single avenue working better than others. The only downside is that others in my gaming circle feel this is complicated and takes a long time, though I personally disagree with both of those sentiments. Others may not like the cyclical nature of the game board where you literally run laps around the board over and over again. Ultimately, this is a great game that deserves 3-4 plays just to see the options and avenues. I would recommend this without reservation.

I've never understood why Mombasa got so much appreciation as it did because frankly I thought it was unfocused and mechanically overwrought. Consequently I was slightly apprehensive regarding this game as it is designed by the same designer, produced by the same publisher, and has a game weight on par with the aforementioned title. As it turns out, my suspicions were confirmed but only subjectively speaking. Great Western Trail really is a good heavy euro with multiple paths to victory, adequate variability in the setup to guarantee a different game experience each run-through, and enough apparent identifiers in the decision space to secure the possibility for the players to ultimately master the game. But in my own subjective opinion, heavily biased (as opinions usually are) by my personal game palate, I find Great Western Trail to be yet another near miss from Alexander Pfister because of its, for lack of a better term, "hodge-podgeness". I would describe it as a frankensteinian game design, where Caylus, Russian Railroads and Dominion have been stripped for parts and put together again, not higgledy-piggledy per se, but neither sleek nor harmonious, and then finally brought to life. The game absolutely works and is unquestionably an impressive design feat, but its monstrosity is still showing.

It is the quickest long game I've played, turns are so quick, time goes by faster with this one.

and yet another game with a Dominion-like mechanism.

There's a lot to think, there's a lot to do, there's a lot of luck, but ways to mitigate it.

I really suck at this game, but i like it.

I think one of the things against this game is the teaching, there's a lot to cover, I compare it to a Feast for Odin, FFO is easy to teach, there's a lot, but it is really the same actions but bigger, in GWT you have to go through a lot of stuff, trains, people, cows, hazards, teepes, green hand and black hand, stations, stations where you can put your workers in, white spots, black and white spots, red X, building you can build... etc. In FFO you can explain each row of actions and say "you need to feed and cover this, to make more points you need more territory or building, this is how you hunt, this is how you pillage" basically and people get the hang of it organically, GWT has to be taught in detail

I had heard some good things about this game, and when I could play a copy of a friend, all those good things were confirmed. You have lots of possibilities, the rules are quite straightforward, turns are quite fast and the material is nice to look at. 

There is however a big minus: the gaming time. Off course only 1 play so far with 3, but the 2 other players had played it before and I can say from myself I'm a fast player, even if I don't know the game, and it still took us 3 hours. Surya and Myriam told me there first game was even longer. And  that worries me a bit as how often will you play a game with such a long gaming time? 
I will always be keen to play it, as I must say it doesn't feel like it took 3 hours while you are playing!

not a bad game, but still unclear on viability of different strategies.  cows seems to beat every other strat.  played once with 4, which was too many.  three was better but two is best.  there are some things that happen in set-up that hamper the game too much.  we are house-ruling some things: only 1 hazard per trail at the start, each hazard only costs 1 regardless of color.  i traded this game.

A mixture of deckbuilding with pick up and delivery. It works very well! Despite the somewhat daunting look of the board, the rules are not that complex. You  quickly immerse yourself in the business of getting your herd (deck) through the most favourable route. Stops along the way provide chances for unique actions, so you don't want to get to the destination too fast. But if you take too long, your opponents may acquire a unassailable lead. Highly recommended!

Inferior to Trickerion. Rule book was a mess of fluff. Symbol lookup was all over the place. No mechanic was especially great. No player interaction at all. The hazards added nothing to the game and only increased the point salad. I'm unconvinced the green/black hand having different player count penalties would add enough swing to the game to be needed for balance -- it greatly overcomplicated play and iconography. Went into the game primed to enjoy it, liked the artwork, spent one evening getting through setup and 60% of the rules and was exhausted to the point where we waited until the next day to play. The rule book material is so floppy and big, it's like holding a wet lasagna noodle - infinitely frustrating given how much icon lookup is required.

RATING: 8
Another of Alexander Pfister's "a lot of simple" games: there is nothing ground-breaking or complicated about GWT, but the many parts work well together to create an engaging game where, with each iteration you feel like you can do better next time round. The teach, much like Mombasa, is a bit of a bear; and, although I'll concede that it is somewhat thematic (breeding cattle) I hate it when deck-builders don't give you the card you just bought straight away (BH2045 has a lot of good stuff to answer for in that respect). There is a some player interaction with the buildings, but for the most part you compete with yourself to improve your various engines. Although I'm not usually one for a lot player interaction and denial, I think I prefer Mombasa slightly in this respect, as there is a lot of push and pull on the map, co-optition for the shares and outright panic getting to your preferred actions. On the plus side, no Bookkeeping track in GWT!

This game is a giant roundel where players circle around trying to get the highest value hand at the end of the loop, consisting of a set all different cow cards. As you play, your movement points get used up more and more, as players add additional buildings and hazard tiles to the routes. Which buildings you construct and how slow or fast you cycle around defines your whole game, which is some fascinating and ever changing decision points. There's a degree of deck building happening as well, as the cow cards come from and are discarded to a personal deck. Many of the actions allow you to manipulate that deck in different ways, removing low value cows or adding more high value cows.

Excellent engine/deck building game.  Many strategies to explore and combos to discover.  Random setup and tile draws makes each game feel fresh and not scripted.  When it is not your turn, you can be planning for your next turn or two.  So turns often go quickly and players are constantly involved.  Player interaction is good and without any "take that" elements.  Feels like multiple races are going on at any given moment.  Love it!

interesting concept for a game (cattle drive). Deck building (to an extent) plus actions on a board. Extend your trains out from Kansas City. Score points based on the value of your cattle herd. Iconography takes some time to understand, but it makes sense. Your first game will be a learning game.

I EXPECTED: Look at that cover! Snooze fest with a side of engineering serial killer! And hearding cattle is the fun part?! Holy hype they better be right about this one.

REALITY: Holy cow pucky Batman, this game was AWESOME! Cover aside this game was great. The worker placement was standard but the selections were fantastic and no annoying blocker mechanic, sweet. The level of depth given to strategy is grand which gives it a huge bump in my "playing this again" department. And the cows! I've never been so excited about cattle before, no not excited... gleeful. I played it with the kids today and they liked it! That's what makes this game a winner to me.

RATING: 10
What a game! Looks complicated at the beginning, but it's basically a mish-mash of deckbuilding, hand management, and action efficiency. There seems to be three main strategies to the game, each corresponding to each type of worker you can hire. It seems like the engineer strategy is the strongest due to the vast amount of bonuses on that track. The cowboy strategy and getting cows for cheap is also viable. I have never seen anyone be able to work the builder strategy. Lots of replayability. Awesome gameplay experience.

Great Western Trail has a lot of things going for it that I enjoy. It rewards long term planning and allows for planning several moves ahead. There is a good bit of engine building which I enjoy. There is a theme that ties the game together (although it admittedly is a bit loose and isn't as finely integrated as I think most Rosenbergs are). It's made by a designer that I think makes quite a few smart games. 

While I don't have enough plays to confirm it, I suspect there the various strategies and paths are viable, and a quick search of the BGG threads suggests that it is possible to win with myriad of strategies including focusing on cattle, trains, or buildings. The winning strategy often will change based on how the craftsmen emerge and how the buildings are placed, along with what choices the other players make. All of this leads to a game with some great strategic depth that will reward repeated plays. 

Taken all together this is the sort of game I often love. I quite like this one and further plays may push this even higher for me. In a sign that this game really is something great for me, I often keep thinking about it after my play, considering what choices I could have improved upon and what strategies I can employ in the future. Looking forward to playing this some more and exploring what it has to offer.

I absolutely love this game. It is fun with 2, cool with 3, but most fun with 4 in my opinion. Really gives you time to get moving with your strategy. However, for competitive play, 3 is best as it does allow for faster play and smaller end game. I like the fact that you can come up with a winning strategy no matter where you start, but it gets to be a bit tough sometimes due to timing. The deck building is not really an issue, but the problems encountered when someone hires all the Cowboys or other tiles really stinks. I love this game and enjoy being able to get it to the table.

This game made me aware of the works of Alexander Pfister, and after 14 games I would say, this is currently my number 1 game of all time! This game is just perfect, but here are some reasons why I like it that much:
- The theme! I'm not a thematic gamer, so this criteria doesn't weight that much, but a great and not overused theme is definately a plus for me. This is such, especially for a heavy eurogame. 
- The job market: it is similar to the marketplace (??) in Mombasa, where you have to always keep your eyes on it, and manage your advance on the trail accordingly. When you arrive to Kansas City has uttermost importance. 
- The game is both strategic and tactical!!! There is usually a general path you take (builder, engineer or cowboy) but then you have to react to what your opponents are doing. The mix of this creates so much tension!!
- As a sidenote: compared to the popular views here, I don't think that you have to make a strategic decision about your play at the very beginning. IMHO you have to decide later, when you have to decide about the direction of your specialization. This decision, alongside the timing of it creates much tension during the game. 
The ever changing rondel (?) mechanic is fantastic. The tactical placement of your buildings, the alternative routes, the agonizing decisions about which actions you take and which to leave behind in the actual round is terrific. 
- The art is fantastic!!!

nice theme, minimal action to choose but need a bit of thinking and planning ahead. Many specialize path and option to choose from. 

A little too much on drawing luck, not very strong on passive-agressive action by player as I thought.

Looking forward to play with max players count.

edit: even with max player count, the Green/Black hand is still very weak. The building you built have nothing to do with other player beside slowing the game down. Which is not why I first interested in this game.

reason to sell: better pick up something that has better player interaction than this one.

My first experience with this game was off-the-charts amazing.  It was the single funnest gaming experience I've had to date.

As I was playing, I found myself caught up in my choices to such a degree that I neither cared about the points nor what time it was.  I know I didn't win the game, but I was soooo far from caring because I was enjoying what I was doing so much!

What I love about this game is that it's the kind of game where you are provided enough to manage what you have every round...then just a smidge more so you can invest in that one next thing.  Then on the next round you can manage what you have...then just another smidge more.  You are constantly growing your foundation...but just barely, and at just the right pace.  It's extremely satisfying.

Thoughts after one game:

- It had a good overall feel and there was a lot to explore.
- There are many ways to 'chain together' benefits.
- It is an enjoyable romp with minor 'gotcha' moments that are good fun. But interaction is surprisingly low for this kind of 'Rube Goldberg Machine' type game.
- It's novel how rapidly the turns come around ... although you do very little in them and I felt the frequency made play more reactive.
- Despite its long game length and supposedly numerous strategic options, it felt like all four players were going through roughly the same motions.
- You have no idea who's winning. The game is a huge 'points salad' and, unless you're a math guru, the scores aren't known until you use your calculator and notepad at the end.
- Your choices are too dictated by the luck of your hand draw. If your hand is poor, you'll go to buildings that change your hand etc.
- Likewise, the restrictions on movement distance/direction mean you'll tend to hop forward to whichever of your one or two buildings ahead will do something useful. It's not rocket science.
- There's not really enough 'open information' to play a truly cutthroat Euro game, as you can't know what is in other players' hands. They might be desperate to go to one place or to a completely different place on the board. (On the plus-side, you can see their 'objective cards', which gives you something to try to hinder.)

Overall, it's a good game BUT it pretends to be a delightfully crunchy Euro, like ones by Vital Lacerda etc, and it isn't. The big decisions are too obvious and the information is too hidden. It 'feels' more like a long Roll For The Galaxy to me, even though mechanically it's very, very different. 

When you lose it'll probably be because of things like failing to check you have enough money before heading to a location, or failing to remember what all the buildings do.

This is the kind of game where people will argue it's barely luck dependent, as they're deluded into thinking the game allows smart players to mitigate the luck. Then they lose due to bad luck.

So it's a game you can certainly 'discover' over many plays, but I think it'll be a bit more Stodge City than Dodge City.

This game is a brain burner but the turns are so quick, the art is so great, and the decisions are so fun that I'm happy every time we open the box.  With a few main mechanics, it's fun to try moving, herding, or hiring and see what works each play.  I think this one has to be my favorite game.  One caveat, I never want to play this with 4 people...it starts to crawl...2 or 3 is perfect.

Deck building game with lots of possible strategies and many interesting choices during your turns. You can plan your turn ahead, so (at least in 2-player) there is practically no down time. The game is very balanced and less complicated than it seems at first. I love games with proper iconography instead of text and this one does the job: icons galore and all clear as can be.

Great Western Euro Game. Master piece of a design. Some many things going on but everything makes sense and fits seamlessly together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Remember when euros revolutionized boardgames by maximizing game depth with a minimum amount of rules and mechanics? 

Yeah. Those days are long gone. The era of less is more is fading from the collective memory of the hobby. We are in an era of heavy euros where more is more. More actions. More things to convert. More tokens, More tracks. More cards. More ways to score points. And most of all, more icons. Icons with cubes. Icons with arrows. Icons in every color. Icons. 

Great Western Trail is a modern heavy euro in all it's iconic excess. And let's not forget a near-total absence of interaction. It's the kind of game where you can start your turn while the previous player is halfway through his because nothing he does will affect your plans. 

The placement of buildings on the trail, reminiscent of Caylus, works well. The deck building with the cattle is nice. But those merits don't save Great Western Trail from being another grinding, needlessly complex, multiplayer-solitaire chore of a point salad.

Played this about a week ago.  Enjoyed the game, although did terribly at it.  The card drafting for the cows seemed to screw me over every trip. Different take on some previously used mechanisms, but not sure whether there is too much luck in the game or whether i was just a sour puss.  Would like to play again. The first game did temper my immediate thoughts on owning a copy. There is a definite learning curve to the game that starts to unfold during the first game.  Those that have previously played, or see the interconnections quickly, will do better. And im back to wanting to own a copy *sigh*

Jan '17 Update - have my own copy and added this to my 10x10 list for the year.

May 17 Update - Ok, several games in and this game is fantastic.  There are many ways to mitigate your card drafting luck, through actions available.  The variability in workers available, hazards & default building positions keeps the challenge fresh. Have even played it solo.

This game is AMAZING! It lives up to my expectations and then some. I want to play it a couple more times before I solidify it in my rankings, but it even has a chance to become #1 of all time for me. There is so much to do in this game and so many possible routes to victory. However, this game is not as complicated to play as some reviewers have made it sound. There's just a lot to explain, but it is not complicated to do (easy to play, tough to master). I do feel that a person's opinion of deck building will have a good deal to do with your starting ranking for this game, but it's not the only thing you're doing. So, if you hate deck building, this is still not a deal breaker. The replayability is fantastic even from the start if you randomize the building sides and placement to use (for starting buildings and the player's buildings). I think my favorite part of the game is just the number of times you get to go through the trail and deliver to KC. It's a sense of accomplishment and you really feel like you are getting somewhere and doing something. It gives the same tough decisions of a euro game without that feeling like you are slogging through the game slowly for the elusive victory points.

Get it! Play it! Brilliant!

Gostei bastante do GWT. Do ponto de vista do game design, é incrível que um jogo desse tamanho quase não tenha upkeep. Isso faz com que ele flua rápido, sem interrupções ao longo da partida para fazer manutenção, o que aumenta muito a imersão, não no tema, mas no jogo em si.
A mecânica do rondelzão disfarçado que vai se construindo ao longo do jogo se integra super bem com o deck building e faz com que cada partida seja bem diferente, só com o setup inicial. Talvez eu não tenha me divertido tanto quanto o brilhantismo do jogo sugere, provavelmente pq sou menos fã de jogos pesados e com muitas regras. Mas esse é muito bom.

[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) The core mechanics of this game are rock solid. I wouldn't call the different mechanics (deck building, point to point movement, some engine building in abilities and personal actions, minor set collection, ...) especially innovative, but they are brought together in an exceptionally good way in order to create an intersting game of which the gameplay feels familiar, yet fresh. The game engine runs smoothly and makes for interesting decision making all of the time. During play the board changes with certain paths for your cowboy moving to the Kansas market becoming more or less attractive. The creation of additional buildings along the path creates opportunities for a few players, but slows others down - which they can mitigate by upgrading their ability to move their cowboy further.

(+) Some will disagree with me on this, but for what clearly is a euro-game, I found this game having its theme sufficiently shine trough its mechanics. This aids in understanding the logic of the game and makes for a fun and interesting experience: while making decisions you feel like you are a cowboy optimizing his herd or finding the best location to invest in a building, not just moving tiles and markers around. It is very thematic that when placing buildings I am making a trade-off between placing it on the main road or on a temptingly short but treacherous path with potential hazards impeding the way. With 4 (to 6) cow-cards in hand you navigate yourself a way to the market in Kansas and along the way you try to make the best of it with the cows you are travelling with (with some (I admit often unthematic) opportunities to optimize your hand before reaching the market). Investing in staff feels thematic: when you invest in cowboys, you get better choices when buying new cows; investing in craftsmen (I call them builders) allows you to quickly build or upgrade to spectacular buildings and hiring engineers will boost your railroad endeavours, allowing you to invest in the most interesting stations.

(+) This game is a point salad in that tons of things score you points (money, buildings, deliveries, stations, removed tiles, cows, goal cards, specialized staff, ...), but it doesn't feel like a 'dry' point salad, as you are clearly building up to things. Different strategies are possible (focus on the right herd and making great deliveries [gives you points and serious income coupled with flexibility during actions], focus on buildings [gives you points, slows opponents down and grants you powerful actions not available to opponents], focus on stations [can get you many points, allows for quick action upgrades and enhances income]). You're in it for the points, but each point scoring act also benefits you in some other way (increased income, engine building on your personal abilties/actions, slowing opponents down, opening new powerful building actions, clearing a path of strategic relevance of hazards, ...). That's why this point salad doesn't have that classic 'point salad feel': more often than not, you are not just doing something only for the points, you are also doing them because they help you in other ways. Of course, this only holds true until about 75% of the game: in the finale the point salad aspects do break through with players calculating the worth of their final possible moves in victory points and the game becoming a bit more abstract and mathematical - but hey, you are playing a euro-game still, and we are loving that, don't we? It is a big achievement that for the biggest part of the game, these mathematical aspects often remain hidden beneath a wonderful veil of theme and a feeling of 'personal progress'.

(+) Players start of weak: few personal actions, no personal buildings, a very deplorable herd of cows, ... While playing, players are constantly improving all those things, which gives a satisfying feeling of growth. For this reason this game has a positive vibe: players can constantly improve themselves. The game engine constantly spawns positive dilemmas: "Do I go for this great upgrade, or do I invest in this potential golden gooze(/cow ;) )?".

(+) Different strategic lines can be followed, and I get the impression it is not necessary to focus on everything (despite everyting scoring points). As a player you are in control, and you are free to make choices on which goals you want to (or should) persue - the game will probably not penalize you (much) for neglecting a certain aspect. After having played, the game keeps you thinking about different things you could have tried and other ways to build up your possibilities. Replayability is guaranteed because of the different set-up each time (which makes assessing the board from the start of the game important!): every game players play with a different combination of buildings, the order in which the neutral buildings come out impact play, some paths may be more attractive than others at the start of the game due to the random distribution of hazards, ... 

(+) The game art is colorful and fun. It looks inviting when displayed on the table and the component quality is very good (however, some might say that it is a shame that your personal tableau is thick paper and not cardboard and there is an unfortunate misprint on [u][url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1659174/red-player-building-8-misprint]tile 8B which will be corrected by the publishers[/url][/u] - but don't let that scare you off as I'm sure this will get fixed and in 95% of your games you won't be needing this tile).



[u]The Negative[/u]
(+/-) Players seeking a healthy balance between well performed stategies being rewarded and some luck-elements to keep things spicy and interesting will love this game as it provides just that: the player who realizes his plans in the best and most efficient way will probably win, but occasionally something unexpected can happen (with a card or tile draw). I'm one of those weirdos who would have liked this healthy balance to have tilted even more towards strategy, but I'm well aware that I will be an exception in this. I will say that this game is slightly more luck-based than Mombasa, the previous design by Pfister and to me personally, that's a shame. Don't take me wrong: this is definitely is a skill-based game, not a luck-based one (as the matter of fact, I have a victory ratio of 100% so far :whistle: ), but still it can be a little annoying that a wonderfully ingenious plan can not get realized due to that one impossible draw.

(-) The game truly invites players to make long-term investments: empowering your personal actions, buying (expensive!!) sensational cows [i][who would have thought I would ever write such a sentence on a public forum?!][/i], investing in staff in order to achieve more powerful actions, building impressive buildings, ... There are so much goodies to be had, but this build-up is slow (most of the time you will be investing money into building up an engine and you won't have money left to let it run right away) and before you know it, the game is over. This game had the potential to be a great engine builder, but it is too short to get a truly satisfying experience from running your engine: a lot of your hard fought for investments will only pay off one or two times. I understand this design choice: probably this was necessary to avoid dominant stategies or avoid run-away-leader problems, but still I feel it is a shame that all those beautifull engine building aspects are there, but I can't take that to the maximum due to game length. This makes playing 'Great Western Trail' feel like a great party, but the music stops when everybody is finally on the dance floor.

(-) Gameplay is smooth and quick most of the time, but at times the game is prone to analysis paralysis, especially when a suitable location for buildings must be found or a player with big plans for a sequence of turns runs low on money and tries to find a way to getting his stuff done (calculating expenses and income). This is especially true as the game is nearing its end and the detailed point calculation starts. Still, this is a minor complaint here, because overall turns go quick because most of the time players can prepare their turn while opponents are taking theirs. 

(-) The core of a game turn is very simple: Move, perform an action and fill up your hand with cows until you are back to your max hand. Easy and elegant. However, there is lots of iconography to learn and teach about and new players struggle when rules about different ways to score keep coming (especially true with game rules relating to the railroad).


[u]Conclusion[/u]
In 2015 we got introduced to designer Alexander Pfister by playing Mombasa, a game I (and a major part of the gaming community) hold in very high regard. As the matter of fact, I like Mombasa so much that 'Great Western Trail' was a sure buy for me at this year's Spiel fair. I haven't regretted that decision for a second, because just like Mombasa, with 'Great Western Trail', Pfister again created a wonderful and clever euro-game which faces players with an interesting challenge to build up towards a satisfying goal, keeping players on the edge of their seat from start to finish. Similar to Mombasa, the possibilities for build-up  in 'Great Western Trail' are all challenging and slow - but I would say that 'Great Western Trail' is the ligher of these two games.

For the rest, these two games play out totally differently and they don't feel similar at all. I have witnessed electric discharge above the board of Mombasa due to brainpower spinning out of control, and I don't expect such scenario's with 'Great Western Trail', which also offers much interesting decision making, but plays more frivolously. The mechanics work differently and they each have their own unique flavor and dynamic. Due to the fact that 'Great Western Trail' plays a little more lightly compared to 'Mombasa', but still remains an interesting challenge, I can see this title hitting the table a little more frequently and with a broader spectrum of players.

What I mainly like about this game is the smooth integration of some great known mechanics, creating a dynamic of growth during play and giving the game its own character. It is a positive game full of interesting positive choices. It is a major accomplishment of the designer to have designed an excellent balanced point salad game leaving open enough options for players to persue their own strategic plans, but which doesn't have the dry flavor many other classical point salad games have. This is due to the fact that the game couples nice advantages to point-scoring moves, ensuring the game keeps telling a story other than calculus.

The game offers an appealing toy-box for the engine builders amoung us, but be aware that they should not get their hopes up too much as the game might be over before you ran your engine sufficiently. The game sticks with you in a way that long after playing you find yourself thinking about the best way to navigate through the canyons and what great opportunities lie in getting those buildings out or hiring a different kind of staff next time - and that's all the more reason for me to stick with this game!


[u]Tips for those going in[/u]
(*) Money is tight, especially in the beginning of the game. Investing everyting in building an engine you can't put to use due to a lack of money might not be the best short term plan
(*) In my experience, it works well to put some focus on a strategy, and after you got that up and running, usually as a side benefit, you can start investing in a second strategic path. For example: if you invest in your herd (better cows, deck optimization, ...) you will perform well on deliveries, generating points. However, you will also increase your income, which you could invest in hiring the right staff, for example to build better buildings - opening a new strategic path for your game. Don't try to invest in your herd, buildings, train, ... all at once: best take it one step at a time.
(*) Getting your personal actions/abilities upgraded soon is very intersting. You can do this by making an early delivery or by trying to snatch away the early stations. I especially love the auxiliary ability to replace one or two cow cards in your hand.
(*) Staff is expensive, but very powerful. In some rare occasions they will be cheaper to hire: when that happens, you will want to be prepared to snatch them away before the others do! You can not hope to perform well on a main strategy (herd+delivery, buildings, stations) without the right staff (respectively: cowboys, crafsmen, engineers).
(*) Timing is important: will the game get rushed by players racing again and again to Kansas city, or will there be more time for you to build things up with players taking more stops in order to enjoy builing actions?
(*) Try to avoid stiff penalties for making bad deliveries: they will eat away your end game score and your income.

Such a great game. Many interweaving options and paths to victory, great gamplay at all player counts, nice art. Really the best alround game I own. Would always play this game if asked.
It baffles me that Terraforming Mars gets all of the love when this is clearly the better game from Stronghold in every single way.

My first thoughts after playing was that the game was too long, not intuitive and overly convoluted.

After a second play, with the correct rules this time, I think I quite enjoy this game- even though I still agree with my initial thought that the game is too long for what it provides. This would be an ideal 1-1.5 hr game that plays in at least twice that time frame. I was shocked at how long the game actually took. Fortunately, this game moves at a pretty good clip, turns are short, and choices are often interesting. 

Randomness can be a little swingy and lucky draws can really boost a player more than I'd like to see, especially in a long game. Scores, so far, have not been close and it shows symptoms of what might be a runaway leader issue. For all that, I'm looking forward to more plays.

First impression was that this is a long, rather repetitive game with little interactivity or thematic relevance, and rather dull.

Good medium weight Euro. There’s no a whole lot of player interaction, apart from the pacing and some competition over worker tiles, bonus tiles on the railroad branches, etc. The theme is fun, but it really is just a mish-mash of Euro mechanisms plastered on to the setting that don’t make a lot of thematic sense. I kind of wish there was more focus on different paths to Kansas City, that all paths involved going through the wilderness to get to waystations with buildings as opposed to being able to hop building to building the whole way to Kansas - where’s the cattle drive part. The best mechanics is definitely the deck building/hand management trying to construct a hand that will maximize your income and chip placement eligibility on the railroad when you get to Kansas City; this affects whether you try to move fast because you have a good hand, making the game end faster, or go slow to have more time to reconstruct your hand. I also wish you cared more about what buildings your opponents built, like Caylus/LoW. Not sure why the Indians pay you to take them off the board. Are you getting paid a bounty to kill them, but you have to pay a penalty if you want to kill the 3 Indian tiles in the higher track? Probably reading too much into it, but this just show how the theme is just a setting for a framework of well-integrated Euro mechanisms; the game is not trying to actually simulate a cattle drive.

To long and the game starts to feel repetitive. Buildings really don’t seem to change all that much during the game . Moving your train really seems disconnected from the rest of the theme and is just mechanics in the end. To much luck of the draw with your cattle cards for a game of this complexity

The Big Game of 2017 for me, much as Russian Railroads was in 2014. We are playing this to death right now, and as of this typing, I haven't burned out yet. But I could see it.

Exactly the sort of design I usually despise (a mish-mash of mechanics thrown against the wall, in the hopes that they stick). For whatever reason, this time it worked for me.

Great Western is a (cleverly-disguised) rondel game, where you are going through a loop with some choices about where to stop during the loop. This part reminds me very much of Istanbul, which I consider one of the great designs of the last few years. GWT allows you to modify the loop however, adding stops along the way that only you can use (and that serve to hamper the progress of your opponents).

It has a hand-management/deck-building element, pretty much a rip of Dominion like all of these knock-offs. That's fine.

It has a variable set-up that truly does make every game different. Again, like Istanbul in this way.

It has an over-arching strategic template that reminds me much of Russian Railroads. There are a limited number of kind of "tracks" that you can pursue, and you need to pick probably two, and then develop them well, to play well.

For me and my sons (as well as our game group) it has been a puzzle that we are really enjoying trying to figure out. It is also without question going to be a tournament-worthy game, and will be featured at the tourney-based conventions that we like to attend (WBC, PrezCon, EuroQuest). UPDATE: I'm the GM of this at PrezCon now, and possibly at WBC and EuroQuest in the near future as well.

Less would've been more!

Perhaps better than Mombasa, but my wife hates it - for good reason: Like Mombasa, great ideas and mechanics, an interesting theme. However, instead of streamlining the game, complex layer was put upon layer. The game is inelegant and at times outright confusing. And again, theme and mechanics don't gel together. I sell cows in KC, yet they come back out of nowhere. If I sell along the path, another cow teleports to me. Wow! But we're obviously in an alternate universe anyhow, since San Francisco is off to the East. (Historically correct would've been shipping from Dodge City to Eastern markets. And BTW, the Southern Pacific was built from San Francisco towards El Paso, not the other way around!)
But as I said: better than Mombasa (a very good game), except maybe GWT is even more 'points salad'. Final scoring easily takes 10 minutes. Why, o why? 
Did I mention the icons and rule book are below par? Details - of which there are like a hundred - are near impossible look up in the rulebook. I *really* don't like the development process at Eggert these days... 
The other Pfister games (those with Pelikan in particular) are more fluid and to my liking. GWT and Mombasa could - and should! - have been perfect, but unfortunately transformed into some mutant. Still very good, but an opportunity missed.

PS. I don't see similarities to Caylus and Russian Railroads! All three are excellent, thinky, heavy, and unfortunately overly long games. 
But other than that, GWT feels original and very different from the other two. They may LOOK similar, but work out in very different paths...

I enjoy it and like it, but it almost felt like you were too incentivized to slow down and stop on (almost) every stop you could just so you could cycle out some of your low cards and get to your high ones, which meant that the people who unlocked the double 'Scrap a card' got way too much of a benefit compared to other players as they could make sure they had expensive cattle in their hand without fail, thus getting all the cities, and they didn't bother with cowpokes and just had a high engineer and moved their train all the way up to the end, scoring tons of points in both places. Meanwhile buying a lot of cattle, despite the points it earns you, didn't really seem to be enough, and going for building buildings also didn't seem to net enough high points compared to the other strategies.

I scrapped 5 cattle cards myself and I always seemed to have my junk 1 and 2 cards in my hands mostly at Kansas City, even after slowing down and taking less optimal moves to cycle cards out.

But I've only played the game once. I might have a better time next time, and I might enjoy it better with 3 players. I still think the game is neat and I'm sure I'll get several more plays out of it. Part of me just thinks it might reward one avenue of play over the others, while only providing enough resources for 1 or 2 people to properly pursue them.

The two-sided station tiles create an unique play experience, with much of the game play affected. Combination of A side and B side creates different gameplays each time, and the common station tiles which are placed randomly will affect the game play as well. 

The randomness of station tiles, the concept of chance & probability incorporated into each draw and the decision making of different players will create different gameplay experience for each game.

A game with high replayability, and would love to play again.

This game seems awesome! I have NO clue how to do well, though! It completely eludes me. In my one play I was like thirty points behind the leader, and I had NO clue why. I felt like I was doing pretty well at first and then somehow just fell behind. Again, I really don't understand why or how? I will definitely play this again, as it was fun while I was playing, but I just don't know yet what to do to do well. My rating will hopefully increase with more plays.

Got in trade for Kraftwagen. 

Gamer's game with a lot of moving parts and high depth of decision making. This is way  heavier than what I like these days but it reminded me of a Feld design  and with a bit more theme. It's long, longer than I enjoy, yet I didn't want the game to finish because towards the second half the engines started taking off and my combos were stronger, my cows were better and the competition/blockage was intense. I find it fascnating how for a heavy ass game, turns are so fast and after just a few rounds it all feels soo simple. There is a lot of iconography, little rules, fiddliness, and all that usually bothers me but not here because it's so much fun. I really liked how the worker pool works with it's fluctuating pricing, the personal buildings and their convenience for you and incovenience for others, the public goals, and the deck building is a thing of beauty. I love it.

Riveting Euro with plenty of space to play around with strategies. These games with a half dozen or more mechanisms thrown in the blender an be daunting, but it works. It would sort of be nice if the theme didn’t have quite so many disconnects, but that is close to irrelevant, and production is certainly pretty.

Easier to teach and more forgiving than Mombasa. A real feast of options and paths to take for victory. I can see this will be a little like Russian Railroads - difficult to master, but with loads of variability between games that will make each outing a challenge. I'm very much looking forward to trying out new strategies with each and every game. Good stuff!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun game and good example of what a modern euro-game looks like. Compared to Mombasa there is a more significant luck factor in Great Western Trail (mainly with the card draws). While it won't matter to everyone, the historical inaccuracies of the theme are jarring. It is a lost opportunity that the theme was not better researched.

I do not love the theme of cattle herding on the Great Western Trail, but the mechanisms in this game just blend together so well to make it a unique, interesting and replayable game.  There seems to be many different viable strategies to win, and each is fun to explore.  Best game of 2016!

It's a good game, but I just don't quite get the appeal.  Something about how all the pieces mesh together just seems off to me.  Observant players can know they are going to lose and can't do anything about it roughly 2/3 through the game.

Sleeved.  Plano box. Bought new from Game Universe.  Really good game.  Challenging decisions to be made and lots to respond to based on what your opponents are doing.  The theme is cool though the mechanics don't always match up realistically to what you're doing in the game.  Look  forward to playing this a lot more.  I think it could be fairly equivalent to Terraforming Mars as one of my favorite games.

Big game and my favourite heavier title at the moment! Feels to me a lot like the designer wanted to make monopoly pro edition. Collect money every time you reach go, buy up as you go along. Never get it to the table, and I have been reconsidering the choice of putting "annoying Indians" in there. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Great Western Trail has a bit of everything. The game board is a giant rondel you build as you play, there is deck building, and there are some engine building elements. 

There are three main strategic approaches to the game corresponding to the 3 main types of workers. Strategies built around cowboys involve buying better and better cows for end game points and to set up big deliveries. Craftsmen allow you to build buildings that can simultaneously give you stronger action options, slow down/tax your opponents, and give you points. Buildings cannot be your main source of points, but can contribute to an overall strategy. Engineers let you move your train and get to stations.

I expected to like Great Western Trail quite a bit more than I actually do. The issue is that players are encouraged to rush the end of the game, and I never feel like I have enough time to execute interesting strategic approaches. I haven't had much success with engineers, and getting the most and highest value deliveries is simply more important than other action efficiency considerations unless you can make up the points by getting to the high value stations.

My first two plays went well, I'd like to try again now that I have a better handle on strategy.  Pros:  luck is manageable, there is some reward for planning things ahead, there is just enough to juggle to make the game challenging but not so much that your brain screams.  Cons: The theme only sort of works, there is not much player interaction beyond an occasional race to claim train stations and some minor forcing of payments, and the rulebook is a real pain to navigate. I wonder if at some point in the game's design/development process there was a way for players to trade cattle and/or workers...or indulge in some cattle rustling...or some shady dealings with property.

Really great game. Those who dislike it might call it a "mish-mash of old mechanics" but I'd say it's an "exciting blend of tried and trusted mechanics"! There's elements of Caylus (neutral buildings) Monopoly(!) (fines on opponent buildings), deck-building, and that rail track is visually reminiscent of Russian Railroads. Surprisingly easy to teach and play for what is a comparatively heavy Euro. Several different strategies present themselves, and their efficacy will vary with the distribution of cards and tiles which emerge. Probably a difficult game to master. Great theme - another winner from this excellent designer!

Very strategic game, with colorful production. (The cover to this game does NOT match its feel or component design. Don't judge by the cover!) Lots of interesting decisions, with a variety of ways to win. A lot of symbology to figure out, and the rule book could probably be optimized for quick-glances for the icons. However, once you learn how to find the symbols in the rule book, the game goes quickly.

RATING: 8
Good game once you learn all the mechanics. There are a lot of little tiles that I can move around the board in different parts. The game tries to make this as simple as a can, but a lot of the icons used are not self-explanatory. There's also no point tracking during the game, which would be useful. The rules are a little complicated to learn the first time.

Some things about GWT don't make a Great Deal of Sense: the idea that the cattle you deliver is all about diversity rather than volume; the idea that as ranchers you build buildings on the trail; the whole conceit of Local versus Auxiliary actions. It's kind of silly in many respects.

But it's also an involved Euro where you have that Rosenberg-esque feeling of reward for each turn, yet with faster play. GWT plays really rapidly - even on a first play, after the first few turns things speed up and before you know it, time is running out. If you can overlook the thematic idiosyncrasies then you might get a real kick out of this one.

[2 plays] Complex to learn, easy to understand how to play after a turn or two, and then complex to contemplate best moves and strategies again. Really liked it. I reject any simple comparisons to other games based on a few mechanisms. I think a comparison to Caylus or Dominion in particular is really deceiving, as it only resembles those two at a very thin surface level, and then only in two mechanisms vs the 20 or more things that are going on. It feels like its own game, although after a 2nd play I see some layers that could be stripped away in a cleaner version which would streamline the game but wouldn't diminish the overall experience.

A heavy euro game that isn't accessible to most casual gamers. You'll need to find heavy gamers for this, and for that reason it's hard to get tabled. It's a well designed game that I wish didn't go so heavy on the symbology. There's a lot of things you need to teach upfront before the game can even begin. Once you get through the hurdle of learning and memorizing the symbols, this game flows beautifully. This is a game that I wish I could play more of.

Bár csak fél parti sikerült elsőre így is bőven meg lehetett ismerni a Nagy Wester Utazást. A játékosok marhákat visznek eladni, közben az odavezető több lehetséges útvonalon akciókat hajtanak végre, hogy mire a piacra érkeznek a legkülönbözőbb, nagy értékű haszonállatokkal rendelkezzenek. A játék a jól bevált recepttel működik, több mechanizmust gyúr egymásba. Az egyik fő, már ismert a pakliépítés. Tetszett, mert jól működik, célunk kiszórni a paklinkból a gyenge marhákat és helyükre pontot hozó, minél változatosabb új egyedeket szerezzünk. Saját táblánkon akcióhelyeket tudunk felszabadítani az egyes szállítmányok leszállításával. Ezen akciók közül a legtöbb nem túl erős, a fő táblán jóval használhatóbbakat találni a feltett semleges, majd saját épületek által. Saját táblánkon még három segítőt is gyűjthetünk, ezek közül az egyik a marhavásárlásokat segíti, másikuk az épületeink felrakáshoz szükséges, harmadikuk pedig a vonatunk előrejutásában, ugyanis ez is szükséges a marhaeladáshoz. Számomra a fő táblán található lépés, akcióválasztás tetszett a legjobban. Alapesetben négy lépéslehetőségünk van, a táblán még csak semleges épületek figyelnek a játék elején, ezeken tudunk max. ennyi lépést megtenni, tehát mi döntjük el melyik akción állunk meg és hajtjuk végre. Idővel saját épületeink is felkerülnek, amin csak mi magunk tudunk megállni és esetlegesen ellenfeleink pénzt adnak nekünk áthaladásukkor. Vannak elágazások amelyeken nehézségekkel találhatjuk szemben magunkat, de lehet néha megéri arra menni, hogy kevesebb vámot kelljen fizetünk, illetve ne játékostársunknak, hanem inkább a banknak. Ezek a nehézségek a játék során gyűlhetnek, illetve el is tűnhetnek, amivel egy-egy útvonal vonzósága folyamatosan változhat. A nehézségek útvonalára épített épületek még plusz bónuszt is adnak az alapakcióinkon felül. Nem tudom ez mennyire egyedi, de nagyon jól működik és ez adja a játék sava borsát. Rettentő érdekes, hogy az elején még kevés akciólehetőség miatt mindenhol megállunk, később, ahogy egyre több akció válik elérhetővé egyre gyorsabban haladunk át a táblán, hogy a már egyre jobb állatokból álló kezünket gyorsabban eladhassuk a piacon.
A játék sikere megérdemelt, nagyon jól összegyúrták, még a tematika is átjön, komoly euró. Egyetlen negatívumot tudok mondani, az pedig a játék hossza. Szabállyal 2 és fél óra alatt a játék felééig jutottunk. Véleményem szerint nem gyorsul a játék később se, ezért egy nagyon hosszú játékidejű játékról beszélhetünk. Nem véletlen a közösség ajánlása, hogy 3 fővel ideális a társas, 4-en brutál hosszú lehet.

[2018-02-24]
Két most már teljesen végigjátszott parti után azt kell mondanom a játék nem hosszú, ugyanis a vége felé ismét begyorsul és simán lejátszható 2 órán belül. Viszont én túl egyértelműen érzem a stratégiát. Minél jobb paklit kell összeállítani, a kezdő kártyák eldobásával. A vonatot se fontos akár eggyel se előre tolni, talán még épületek nélkül is nyerhető a játék. Szóval az újrajátszhatósági faktoráról még nem vagyok igazán képben, de marad a pontszám. Jó játék, de a top10 azért erős szerintem.

The issue with this game is the buildings.  You can completely skip building any buildings, race through the game, and win in a 2 player game.  All you need to do is get a building out in a location that forces people to pay you cash.  You go for money, buy cows, sell cows, and discard weak cows.  You will eventually  just race to Kansas and if you lap the other players just once you will earn more cash than the other players allowing you to buy more cows than the other players maximizing points.  I buy cowboys and nothing else.  I still have fun playing the game but the other player is going to be disappointed with how fast the game ends because you moved the  game to end  quickly.  I would like to see the 2 player game fixed.  I do really enjoy this game with 3 players so this is why I give it an 8.  I want to play it anytime with 4 players but rarely with 2 or 3.

One play under the belt and my initial impression...it's good not great. It has a A LOT going on in different locations on the board and it sorta gels. Yet at the same time, I felt it was a bit of too much on the luck side for my taste in this genre. While I liked the "deck building" idea, the execution was just too random. Too many times I couldn't get the cards I needed to bring to market and score the big points. I would try it again if it hit the table.

Rightfully received a ton of buzz at Essen 2016. This is just the kind of game that blends a bunch of mechanics together and does it right. There's several things to do, and each time you take your herd through to Kansas City, you have to decide carefully your sequence of actions. By building buildings to determine the actions and when you can take them, the replayability is huge. There's a bit of a set collection and managing your the herd and gathering more cattle is a cool deckbuilding mechanic. On top of all of this, you've got this Egizia-esque mechanc of how far do you go down the trail to Kansas City, knowing you can't go back your next round. The bonuses are varied, and it just seems that you're immersed for a couple of hours making tough and interesting choices.

As ridiculous as it sounds, the only thing that keeps me from giving this game a perfect score is the initial learning curve and /literally/ the worst board game instructions manual I've ever read.

Otherwise this is currently my group's absolute favorite game. Engaging, fast, and incredibly diverse in gameplay. There are many, many different avenues to victory and viable strategies, from monopolizing train stations, to amassing cleared hazards, to buildings, to worker monopolization, and of course, good ole' cow-hustlin'.

The game starts very simply, but as it continues and your own power grows, it turns into snakes and ladders /from hell/. But no matter how late in the game it gets, and how complex the board may look, no one's turn ever takes more than 10 seconds, and it will often be your turn again almost immediately after taking your last one. There's no snore-fest downtime in this game. It's a race to Kansas City through-and-through, but prepare your herd well, or you'll never get to send your cows off to the coveted San Francisco.

At the time of this writing, this is (in my opinion) the best and most fun boardgame ever made.

GET. THIS. GAME.

One of my favourite games so far, definitely in my top 3. Fantastic artwork. Fantastic mechanics - I love the deckbuilding element combined with the multiple ways to win and traveling around the board (do I go quickly or slowly?!) to eventually drop off your cows at Kansas City. There are many different strategies and you need to watch how your opponents are playing to try and combine the best strategies for that game. Highly recommend Great Western Trail!

Very enjoyable game, best with 3 (or maybe 4 fast) players! Multiple paths (thin deck racing to Kansas, fatter deck optimizing slowly along the way, building or not, etc.) seem viable. Looking forward to trying the B-sides of buildings!

This is a pretty cool deck-building style of game. Your deck has a bunch of types of cattle. You're trying to optimize your hand in the time (several turns) it takes to get your marker from start to Kansas City. Along the way, you can stop at buildings (neutral ones, and those you build yourself) to take a variety of actions (e.g., buy more cattle, earn coins, thin your deck). At the end of your cattle run, the higher the value of your hand the further you can place your marker (worth more VP, earn more coins). 

Once you understand the rules and the functions of the various buildings, the game SHOULD play very quickly. Very fun game, worth getting a copy!

Such a great game, my second favorite of 2016 (behind the amazing Scythe).  This game is kind of hard to put into buckets based on mechanics.  It is basically a rondel game with multiple paths through the route on each pass.  Each time it is your turn you move a number of steps up to your movement speed and use the action for the space you end your movement on.  These can be many different things from hiring workers to acquiring wealth to rustling cattle.  There is also a minor deck building element.  At the end of each pass of the route you gain benefits based on the value of the cattle cards in your hand.

I think my favorite thing about the game is the sheer depth and breadth both of strategy it offers.  There are so many ways to gather points and many paths and decisions to be made at every point of the game.  Even little things like being able to choose whether or not to play objective cards in front of you or keep them in your deck offer interesting tidbits of strategy.  Playing them in front of you means you can lose points if they aren't achieved.  You can still score them while in your deck but they also serve to clutter up your hand and deck.

The components are incredibly standard to sub par.  There's really no artwork to speak of except for the worker profiles and different cows.  I never knew there were so many different kinds of cows.  Some of the actual components aren't great like the thin paper player mats and others are fine but nothing really is better than that.

But what is on offer here design wise can make you forget about the sturdiness of what you play it on.

Can I look at my cards? Rules: You can look at hand and discard, not draw.
My opinion (and others): You can also look at draw, as long as you shuffle afterwards.
Reasoning (from thread): You're allowed to look at your hand and discard pile and you know every card you added, by definition you know what is left in your deck. We could make everyone get pen/paper and keep track of this information and slow the game down, but that is just unnecessary bookkeeping. So we allow anyone to check their deck then reshuffle. This game has zero deck manipulation (putting cards back in your deck in a specific order) so it only makes sense to allow people to look whenever they want. A random draw is a random draw.

GWT has ended up being my game of the year for 2016. We played Scythe a few days earlier and I didn't think anything could beat it, but the trophy edged over that half-hair's distance between the two.

Many of my comments for Scythe apply here, despite it being a very different game, so why do I prefer GWT? I think it's purely a matter of personal taste. Moo cows are adorable. My family is from Texas. I like moseying along a trail repeatedly without any of the tedium of roll-n-move games. It's light in theme but can be thinky, too. (Well, it's light if you're like me and taking the cows sightseeing, not to the slaughterhouse.) 

I love Scythe despite some potential subjective obstacles (I'm not into minis, mechs, or politics), but I simply enjoy Great Western Trail without any reservations.

Such convolution. Literally half the game could and should have been removed. It feels like someone playtested, found an issue, added a rule to fix it, and repeated this process ad nauseam.

The game has so many things that just don't make sense. New cards going into your discard pile. The train advancing *away* from the station, but making it cheaper to run *from the station*. Green teepees. Blue teepees. Teepees at all. Oh and hazards. Which aren't the same as teepees. And goal cards, which go into your discard pile. But there's not really any great risk to them because at the end of the game you can just choose not to use some. Oh and you can build stuff. But there's really only one optimal spot to put that first level forest building. And the rest of the buildings? Well, good luck winning if you try to pursue that strategy.

Then there's the cows. Blue ones. Red ones. Yellow ones. Purple ones. Convoluted costings that I am sure were precisely mathematically calculated. But of course, selling two cows of the same breed gets you no more money. Mmkay. Oh, wait, but you can get ribbons to pretty up your cows! But you can use them on any cows. A bit like a fraudster.

The rulebook isn't the best, the iconography is mediocre to poor (Why oh why are the costs to buy workers listed as negative numbers!? Then there's that building that lets you hire workers, the second one listed as -2. So... two cheaper? No, two more expensive. Ughhhh.

Once you add all the rather disjointed elements together the game is challenging, but my god, what a chore. It's a shallow game with a very very very broad set of rules. Give me an elegant euro like CoB, or Puerto Rico any day of the week.

Like Mombasa a big mash-up of mechanics with no connection between them at all. It makes the already thin theme disappear as you have no relation between what you do and its impact on the game.
Anyway, I was ready to hate the game after the explanations (god there's a lot of stuff for little reason), but I got to admit it was great fun planning your movement, your hand for deliveries and optimizing your situation. The race to the end game is quite tense and I feel all players played quite differently with everyone having a chance to win.

Replace Mombasa as my favorite Pfister.
I wish scoring was less (a lot less!) convoluted. Also Pegasus could've a made way better iconography for lots of thing that are not instinctive (+ sign to pay less?!?), hard to read and inconsistent (sometime refers to the resources and other times the components).

Excellent marriage of theme and euro; not necessarily the actual cattle drive aspect --the herd is certainly abstracted, but the business management involved is right.  There are so many avenues to explore here.

Probably my favourite euro-efficiency game since Russian Railroads. Players move their cowboy meeple along a track representing the a cattle trail ending in Kansas City (supposedly, according to the forums, ahistorical nonsense). Initially the trail is sparsely populated by action spaces, but as players construct buildings new actions become available. 

On arrival in Kansas the player must sell their herd, scoring for each different type of cattle card in hand. A higher-scoring herd is worth more money and more victory points; a low-scoring herd is severely penalised.

It plays smoothly but I have some misgivings about its implicit constraints.

The requirement to sell in Kansas essentially prevents monofocus on other elements (such as a train push or building strategy). Likewise, the cost of delivering to a city far ahead of the player's train forces participation in the train push, and so on. There are a number of approaches and room for tactical variation (e.g. herd deck thinning vs deck cycling, pushing one scoring category vs another) but extreme strategies do not appear to be viable.

It's particularly annoying when these constraints are based on unthematic nonsense -- e.g., if you can't deliver to the same city twice because you're establishing a trade route or something, then other players shouldn't be able to deliver to it either. If there were actual competition for those slots, well, that would be interesting.

Random elements are superficially minor but can be significant. Good/bad herd draws can have particularly high impact, both immediately on scoring and on avoiding the enormous opportunity cost of wasting actions thinning or cycling a deck; other in-game randomness tends to merely inhibit strategic planning (availability of useful person tiles, unpredictability of hazards/teepees). 

I don't think turn order advantage is sufficiently compensated across all random layouts.  While the board has branching paths, some actions are often exclusive, which makes placing buildings with a cost to pass on that path extremely powerful. One particularly problematic example is if there is only one path to the "hire a person" action. This action requires significant money, so players can't go broke to avoid paying a toll, and it is required to be competitive with any strategy. A more minor niggle is that if players have roughly the same tempo then the player last in turn order will be the one to end the game and therefore will have fewer turns.

A pleasant way to pass the time but overrated.

A great strategic game with a good thematic feel. Who could have thought that cattle herding could be this much fun! 

Each game offers a new challenge to craft your strategy from the placement of the neutral buildnings/actions along with your own available player buildings. Too make your actions more efficient and to give you strategic direction you need to start hiring dudes right away. It is fun to experience your actions getting better and your herd becoming more valuable.

Engaging mechanics, some indirect player interaction and rewarding game play with tough decisions makes this a great game.

As a negative sometimes it feels like the luck of the draw has a big impact on the game.

First go through there's a tonne about this game I really like. From choosing for fast or slow you should go around the loop, what abilities to unveil as you do trying to time things so you have the best setup for your cows at Kansas city... really good stuff... but man is it long. Long is fine but our first game was 3hrs+ and I felt like the game just stalled  from an interest standpoint at the 2hr mark. Hoping the next play will go quicker.

I was so hoping  to like this game because I truly love Mombasa.  Theme is so important to me and I truly love western themes..... I even started to design a game along this idea so I had to try it even though it had a mechanic that I truly hate .... card drafting / deck building.  I was so hoping ..... however once I got into the game I felt like it was Dominion meets Caylus and I truly dislike both games.  the game works well but I felt a number of mechanics were to random for me and I could never make a plan that I could count on to come to fruition.  I found myself not paying attention to the game instead of Momabasa where I was constantly engaged planning my next move.  It did not help that I played with to AP players so down time vs activity was skewed heavily.  I found myself staring across the room and if I had a book I would have read anything else.  The game works ...... just not for me

RATING: 8.25
Rating from a single play of 4 players. Want to try it again with 3 to see if the game picks up pace and see how replayable it is. So far it is very enjoyable, although I feel it might be a little too AP prone and has a little bit too much randomness and luck early on that is hard to mitigate (getting the right draw can snowball into more success later). Still very interesting and the theme fits very well.

EDIT: Bumped up my score a bit to 8. The different board layout and building tiles seems to add a decent amount of variety. I still question some of the balance and some strategies that are outside of the norm (such as some buildings seem fairly useless). But it is still a very enjoyable game and I want to play and explore it more.

EDIT 2: Another game and up to 8.25. Feels a little repetitive in some parts, but the different building layouts and sides lead to some variation. Plus, the game definitely allows multiple paths to victory. It would get a higher score but some elements of luck can crop up that just completely cost you the game (bad draws or something messing up your timing). Since the game is usually fairly tight the luck element can really hurt. Still a great game and one I'd love to play more.

Slow burn.  Long teach with a lot of parts, plus relatively lame symbology, but a really good game once you understand what you can do and how it all works!  Many paths to victory, but in general you need to touch on pretty much everything, at least in your first play through.  Wasn't sure how i felt about the game but as it went it got better and better for me.  The 'deck-building' element was more of a really-large-hand-management system wherein you only had part of that hand at any given time.  Recognizing the available spaces, knowing which ones you need to keep cycling through your strategy and which are most efficient for what you're trying to do and then how you will get to them are the biggest components with the exception of managing your money (have to pay for shit).  Would really love to play again soon, in order to start the game with a more cohesive strategy and focus.  Plus would like to try out more of the double actions now that I understand what they do!

RATING: 8
So, first play at Geekyway to the west 2017 took 6 hours. Analysis Paralysis is, or well should not be a problem for this game and it still took this long.  


There are many strategies in this game, some are pretty much dead ends.  But the game is strong, and 2 plays will make any player more than competent. 

If there is one thing I might say about it is that it tries to do too much. There is a deck building and hand management mechanic, action selection, worker placement (although you don't place them per se), and a few others.

As frustrated as I was with how long it was taking, I still want to play, with people who already know how to play and I am sure it will be a much more pleasurable experience.

This game is very heavy. Its appearance looks trivial but be prepared for 3 hours of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good heavy game with two major flaws in my opinion:
The game doesn't keep track of who has how many points. So either players keep track themselves which slows down the game even more or they don't which gives the game a random feel - you just do what you do and discover at the end how well you actually did.

The deck building mechanic adds too much chance for a heavy game that takes that long. Card draw near the end of the game can result in massive point swings - in one game at one point I had a 3/4 chance for 13 points and a 1/4 chance for -6 points, a 19 point difference that hinged on drawing one card. It is possible to significantly reduce the randomness, but that limits the strategies you can use. I can see the appeal of the deck building mechanism in GWT, but I don't think it works that well.

Amazingly great game with an interesting theme.  I never thought I would enjoy a theme about selling cattle, but it fits the game mechanics well!  

A couple of additional thoughts about this game:  after three plays, I think I finally have all of the rules down packed and they all make sense.  There are a lot of rules to the game, and during my first two playthroughs, with different groups of people, different mistakes were made from setup to possible actions to take to all things in between.  

It may take you several plays to really get the hang of it, but if you enjoy Euros, this is a great one once you figure out all of the subtle rules that are all specified in the rulebook, but that you may gloss over because there's so many in there.

Extras I own:  grab bags for the 1,2, and 3 tiles.  2 extra station tiles from BGG store.

Rulebook is extremely well-written and organized.

Seeing the high ratings, this is no doubt a very intricate interlocking Euro game with dozens of different strategies and options to explore.

Yet, I pass. For several reasons:
a) Theme. Herding cow, while novel, is not a theme that grabs me. I like the gun-toting cowboys better even while they're not real-life. Carson City, BANG!, that stuff. Also, while the board might be thematic, the deckbuilding is typical abstraction that might work as a game-mechanic, but not thematically.
b) No novel mechanics. Build your own map, get somewhere first before point values are going down, deckbuilding, resource into coins into vp's, different actions etc. It might be great interlocking but where is the novelty? Sure, if you don't need novelty but simply a game that runs like a clock, this might be great. But not if you already own dozens of other games that do that.
c) Too much stuff going on. Game you need investing time in. Time I don't have.
d) Point salad. Publishers tend to take a look at the rankings of BGG and as these Feld games get high ratings the 'point salad plague' seems to have taken hold. Reward those players for ANYTHING they do! Make it so that games end 499 to 503 points so everyone will feel it was so close! Sorry, while I know basketball is a popular sport I prefer soccer. A good 0-1 will do, if the game itself is tense and interesting. Games tend to go for lower tension arcs, rewarding players in their very own turn with minor achievements, thereby avoiding the disappointment some can feel if their grand multi-turn plans are twarthed somewhere at the very last moment. Sorry guys, I WANT multi-turn planning. I WANT scheming for an action somewhere down the road and (inadvertentedly) being foiled in my schemes by someone doing other stuff. I LIKE that tension.
e) Too fiddly. Too much moving components do distract from what makes a game good. Simple, elegant, slick design. Deep Sea Adventure. Onitama. El Grande. Heck, even Dominion. All examples of games that just focus on one mechanic and do it great. Less is more people. That holds true for games as well.

Now, if you like point-salad, broad action space games with lots of moving parts, have a lot of time to invest in a game, don't own many games already and are not interested in theme (or happen to dig the 'real cowboy' theme), this might be totally up your ally. 

Not my ally.

tl;dr: more of the same... good stuff!

This game was hyped at the show after last year's [thing=172386][/thing] turned out so well. It went on my radar but the western theme doesn't help. But it was clear this is a traditional, rather heavy euro, not a real cowboy gunslinger game. Good.
First, let me say that the rules where very well written and structured. I had to do very little lookup work even though there are quite some rules tied to a couple of actions or locations. It does have a lot of nested 'if' statements. If you do this action, then you check that. If that is the case, then the following might occur. If the result of that is B, than  something else might happen. That kind of thing. But we had few questions and found the answers easily. And when playing, everything does make sense.
Anyway: this game is not original. Build some buildings, use some building's actions, use resources to score points... All stuff we've seen before, but it's all put together skilfully. Every turn you have to keep in mind a good number of variables and make plans for the future while still staying flexible.
I must say I really enjoyed playing this game a lot. It looks like Pfister has an other hit on his resume. Sweet.

Point salad, but with a nice framework. Cowboys cycle through a branching-path network, starting in Texas and ending in Kansas City. Elements in the game include: a Dominion-like draw of cattle; areas along the network which allow building; a mostly linear train track, VP-collector. Cowboys let you buy more and cheaper cattle; artisans allow higher level buildings, which only the owning player can use and may impose a passing penalty on others; and engineers (magnates?--they wear top hats) that move your train faster.

I tend to think cattle/cowboys are needed. Whether buildings/artisans or train/engineers are superior or need balancing, I'm unsure. More plays needed.

Usually I play GWT with 2 players (me and my wife) and yesterday was a full 4 player game. The same estrategy my wife used to win was useless. Everytime someone can change what you were planning, so you have to think of a lot of ways where you can maximize points. The play time took 2:30. There is a lot of constructions on the way, and walk more was more usefull first than 5/6 cards.

I'm going to give this game the most backhanded compliment I've ever given: this is likely the best terrible game I've ever played.

It's terrible because it's incredibly overwrought, which adds immense breadth but little depth.  This breadth makes the game a complete slog to teach (40 minutes from a great teacher!) but then is at heart an incredibly simple game.  This is the purest example of everything AS WELL AS the kitchen sink that I can think of.

It's terrible because the game can take almost three hours but there is never once a feeling of ebb and flow or drama because it is almost impossible to tell who is in the lead at any given time.  Because EVERYTHING gets you victory points.  So whose multitude of victory points are highest at any given time?  *shrug*  Though I guess is doesn't really matter because there's nothing you can do to really affect other players, which brings me to...

It's terrible because I've played few other games that offer so little player interaction.  This is multiplayer solitaire at its worst.  You could literally play the entire game with only a rare glance at what other people are doing and do just fine.  That's forgivable in a game that takes 60 minutes or less but not so here.

It's terrible because I was excited to play a game with this unique theme of driving cattle but the theme just does not come through.  This is how the players talk during the game: "Ok, I move two spaces.  I'm going to stop here and convert this black card into two coins and my second action allows me to do an auxiliary action, so I'll draw two cards... *draws* and discard these two." YEEHAAW!

The most frustrating thing is that I can see sparkles of a great game nestling within this steaming cow patty.  This could have been a fun family game if the designer or publisher had just said "whoa!" and reined things in.  As is, though, I can't imagine this game having much longevity.  There's a reason why the Knizia classics had legs. Modern game design needs to look back a little further for its influences.  To me, Great Western Trail is the epitome of what is wrong with post-Agricola Euro games.

This game is seeing a lot of praise right now. It isn't really my thing, but I can easily see why... This game is complex to a point of extremity, but intuitive once you get it down however long that may take. This is its virtue as well as its vice... The crazy ten step scoring system may feel unwieldy, but it facilitates a Beautuful victory point end, where points come from so many so many sources, you have a myriad of options to pursue as your path to victory... Plan, adapt, engage, win. It's a bit dry for me, and an intense board setup/tear down, and left me really wishing for a digital version, but there's no denying it's a brilliant design.

Move along the path to Kansas City, selling your cattle, diversifying your herd, improving your business operations, and ultimately making money to do it all again. Buildings you build on the path either give you better actions, or additional money since opponents passing through owe you a fee. Throw in a subtle deck-building element and you've got a unique-feeling, heavy-weight, Pfister Euro. I wish it played just a bit shorter, but aside from that, it's a solid design.

I give it an 8 after two plays. But I need more to decide if it's a keeper. In my first two games, the same strategy was the winning strategy. We'll see.

::UPDATE::

My third play proves there are more strategies that the one I saw employed by the winners in the first two games I played. I also think the winning strategy is always going to be dependent on how each game develops, which is a really good thing. I like it when the players determine the mood of the game. I'm still keeping my rating at 8, but I'm starting to think I'll be keeping it. Each time I play, I find myself grinding the gears on what I could have done better. Can't wait to play more.

::UPDATE::

And my fourth play bumps it up from an 8 to a solid 9. This is a really good game. It may end up among my favorites if it continues to show more and more layers. Well done, Pfister!

Turns are very simple but have many, many different actions and places on the board to consider.  3 worker types to spend, and plenty of upgrades are available.

Excellent game, there is a lot of game in here and a ton of decisions to be made in a quick play time.  Very conceivable to get a game done in 90 minutes.

There's a lot of room for creativity, just the right amount of deck building, engine building, action selection, etc.

I'd raise my rating half a point if I ever see the "big" buildings used successfully but so far I haven't got the impression that they are worth the effort.

Excited to play this more.

The sheer amount of replayability in this game is mind-boggling. Setup is ultra randomized, there are many paths to victory (both literally and figuratively) and the board will never look the same in two games due to the players building their own structures along the way.

It has a very refreshing take on deck-building and the game gets really tight toward the end. Some rules aren't super intuitive and the iconography throws a lot at you but I can feel the greatness in this game after a single play.

RATING: 7
Great Western Trail is what I call a "Kitchen sink" game, where the complexity of the game arises from throwing a ton of mechanisms and stuff at you. Initially it is pretty overwhelming but about halfway through the game things started making sense and it felt a lot simpler than it originally looked.

The game is a deckbuilding game that doesn't feel like a deckbuilding game. You start with a deck of cow cards which are different colors and values. You'll be moving your pawn along paths on the board eventualy reaching Kansas city at the end of the track.

Once you hit Kansas city, you present your hand and total up all the cow values in your hand, but you can only use one card of each color. Then you remove a disc from your player board (which gives you some bonus) and put it in a city spot that equals or exceeds your "cow score". You can only visit most cities once, so you'll need better and better cow scores as the game goes along. There's always a spot at the 0 cow score spot, but you lose 6 points for going there. There's also bonuses and penalties for taking two adjacent city spots (bonuses for the high cities, penalties for the low cities). Additionally at Kansas city, you get a little bit of choice about seeding the board with new stuff and you get money equal to your cow score.

When you move around the board, you must follow a path. You have a base movement rate which is how many buildings you can pass or get to on your turn. So if your movement is 3, you can move skipping over two buildings, then skipping over two hazard and landing on the next building. You must pay a buck or two penalty for passing a hazard. When you land on a building, you can trigger its power assuming it is either your building or a public building. You get a compensation for landing on another person's building, but don't do that. The game starts with long paths without many buildings... but as the game goes along players can building buildings, making it harder to get far on the paths, and giving themselves more building abilities to trigger.

Buildings let you do various things, like hire helpers, play certain cow cards to get money, buy new cards from a public offering, build your personal buildings, etc. Your buit buildings give you points at the end of the game. Some buildings also count as hazards for your opponents. Some of them push you further along the track when you land on them.

There's also a train track that you're trying to advance on. Essentially you pay a money penalty when you hit Kansas City if you try to score a large city, but you're not far enough on the train track. There's also stations along the train path, where you get to remove discs from your player board and get points... and possibly get a scoring bonus goal.

You also start the game with a contract you're trying to fill for bonus points. There's way to get more contracts, from a public display, and a way that you're forced to sometimes. New contracts go into your discard pile and clog your deck. You get a bonus for playing a contract, but then you're committed to completing it and there is a penalty for failing to. Contracts are mostly "Do these 3 things in the game and get X points" type of stuff, so if you take contracts that synergize with stuff you're already doing, it's free points.

There's a lot going on in GWT. I had a lot of fun... once I started getting the game. I do have a concern that the game might have balance issues. I'm not sure if all the strategies are balanced. Also, it's a bit heavier than most deckbuilders, so random draws going against you is more painful than they are in a typical deckbuilder.

[thing=193738][/thing] is an intense mix: hand management, deck building, movement, tile placement. The feel while playing it was a profane match between [thing=18602][/thing] (due to the order in which to acctivate the buildings, which demands a lot of planning beforehand) and [thing=58421][/thing] (due to, once a place is passed, there is no way to return to it in the same travel).

Yet, it is a mix that works: the mechanics are clever, there is a fine dispute for places in the train track, for positioning the buildings in the path, for hiring workers, etc; though most of it is indirect. The playing time can grow fast, since there is so many ways to go and choices to make, still the pacing of the game gains a lot if players think about what they want to do before is their turn, since the others usually (not always) interfere little with your next move.

[thing=193738][/thing] gives a big amount of choices and options to the players, but this comes at a price: the already mentioned playing time (which can get near, of even pass, 3 hours), and the long and tedious explaining of the rules, as there are many details spread over several parts of the game, all with relevant connections with other parts, thus needing explaining. The learning curve is also rather steep.

[thing=193738][/thing] offers a multitude of paths to follow (both literally, going on by the buildings on the board; as figurativelly, as in strategies to win), lots of timming concerns, considerations about positioning of buildings, purchases of cattle, advancements on the train track, and so on. It also has a good replay value, due to the random positioning of the starting buildings, the blind draw of hazards and workers, and even the use of the A and B sides of the players buildings.

Overall, [thing=193738][/thing] puts itself as a deep and good euro, one that definitely won't fit everyone tastes, considering the high price tag for entering and staying: the rules (specially for those constantly playing with new people needing to learn) and the demands of planning in long term in a long game. Still, by now, you probably know if [thing=193738][/thing] is for you or not.

If you don't like Euros to begin with and are always complaining about multiplayer solo, don't get within a mile of this game.  It's got nothing for you.  However, if you want a complex  gaming experience with no clue as to what's your best strategy, give this a go.  One play, all newbies, 3.5 hours.  With more experience, you can likely boil it down to an acceptable 2 hours.  Just don't expect this to play fast or easy.  The theme is there, albeit a bit weak, but still stronger than a great number of Euros.  Brain drain, certainly.

RATING: 7
GWT will undoubtedly be compared to Mombasa due to Pfister's back to back award winning designs in as many years. Both these games spot very different mechanisms with Mombasa having the refreshing deck recycling mechanism while GWT has the more ubiquitous deck building system. After initial plays, Mombasa just feels more fun, involved, interactive and less repetitive than GWT. GWT however is ranked more highly among gamers and I can see why.

In GWT, turn order is rapid. Something you would not expect from a game with mid to high level of complexity. Folks move their cowboy meeples along the trail and perform a single action. That's it. Turns often fly by and before you can gather your thoughts, your turn is up again.  Generally, fast-paced games with rapid turns is a thumbs up for me. In GWT, I just had trouble absorbing all the information between turns. Consequently, I lost track of player progress and the game became a multi-player solitaire to a certain extent. Turns went by quickly and new buildings were erected, new guys appeared on the job board and were hired, etc. All the while, it was tough incorporating those changes into my own strategy. That, I found somewhat exasperating. I can generally think on my feet, but for some reason, the game quickly became very individual as players just went about their business with low frequency interaction. Even the interactions themselves weren't exactly quality interactions. I myself dislike fiddly rules of "pay-as-you-use" or "pay-if-you-pass" type mechanisms ala Caylus. They just make the game feel busy in a bad way. Eventually, in the late game stages, the pace and rhythm does pick up as the supply of money becomes more plentiful and actions can be strung out to develop the engine. It is neat to build the economic engine, but when things are finally chugging smoothly, the game winds down. My high-value cows never had a chance to go through the deck.

Components wise, the game is fine. Pieces are great but auxiliary player mats are thin. The tracks on the board can be tough to follow and you can lose your path at times. 

The game for me is interesting and demands further exploration. It is a solid Euro with a mix of mechanisms just like Mombasa, but the interlocking pieces in GWT, I feel is not nearly as coherent as Mombasa. Nonetheless, a very good follow up from Pfister and certainly one that will win many accolades in the upcoming months (Kennerspiel perhaps?)

É um jogo bom, muito bom até, mas pelo hype todo, ascenção meteótica no ranking do bgg, eu estava esperando O jogo, e nesse sentido ele decepcionou, pois vejo várias falhas q não me atraem. A sorte é uma delas. Os caminhos desbalanceados para vitória é outra (apesar de ter muitos caminhos, oq é muito bom, poucos me parecem realmente atrativos). Eu sinto nele, adormecido, um jogo muito bom, excelente, só esperando algumas mudanças de regras para aparecer. Veja bem, é até estranho, sinto vontade de jogá-lo mais vezes, mas eu adoraria q ele fosse melhor, pois tinha possibilidade de ser.

===== EDIT

Após uma dezena de partidas, tenho que dar o braço a torcer para esse jogo, ele conseguiu me ganhar. As falhas ainda existem, entre elas a sorte, falta de mais toques de desvios, caminhos desbalanceados (apesar de ter encontrado outras alternativas interessantes tb), ... Mas sua mecânica muito dinâmica roda muito bem, fazendo suas quase 2h de jogo correrem sem vermos o tempo passar, pois cada ação normalmente é muito simples e rápida, levando seu turno a chegar sempre rápido e te obrigando a pensar o tempo todo. Sua ótima rejogabilidade e tema que salta aos olhos completam a lista. Ainda não é meu Pfister favorito, lugar reservado ao Mombasa, mas com certeza tive que aumentar sua nota em alguns décimos.

Pfister is a great designer. I love how I often don't know who's going to win, how there are many paths to victory, and how what to do on any given round is dependent upon other players' actions. after 9 plays I still want to play it immediately after ending, trying out everything I just got wrong in a new way.

Well-deserving of its many accolades. Enjoyable as a rich strategy game and as a lighter, go-with-the-flow activity. Being unable to deliver to a city more than once creates a distinct beginning, middle and end game, which both justifies the long playing time and makes me want to keep trying again and again. I love that it presents both strategic choices (mainly through the hiring decision), and tactical decisions (mainly through the hand management/deck-building), yet it avoids AP by only giving you three actual choices per turn.

First 2p was nothing less than epic. It was a learning game, so much to discover. 
A true adventure! At the beginning we had to get used to the iconography, which started to make sense quickly. 

Nothing negative? Well, four hours is a bit long but we didn't realize until we finished. Since we're not the fastest players, I expect two til two and a half hours now we know how to play, and that's too long for a regular week evening.
UPDATE: at third play it was still 3 hours. Not a problem though, time flies.

At its core it's a rondel mechanic put onto a round trail map. The players modify the rondel actions by adding their own into actions into it. There are a few other mechanics woven into it, but the modifiable rondel was what got me. I found it an extremely fascinating game. I was playtester.

Very enjoyable, solid euro. It feels very balanced and well play-tested. First game we had some rule mistakes that were corrected a few rounds in. Rulebook seems to suck and I would not want to learn the rules myself, but with a teacher this game is great. It also seems to be a very busy board but in the end very clear and good gameflow. It is a bit of a point-salad game that I usually dislike but in this game it didn't get to disturbing proportions and the many mechanics connected quite intuitively and I feel like the game has been well-tested and balanced overall. For example the deck-building element was interesting on the side as I found out mid-game that I actually cared what was going into my deck. However, the deck-building is also a missed opportunity as the best decisions are blatantly obvious and it is more of a race to be the first to purchase so you get what you want.

There are many cog wheels in this quite heave euro game, but it seems to all fit together quite nicely. The deckbuilding part is great, and I really like the trade-off you have to do - do you wanna rush off to Kansas City so you can sell your cattle many times, or do you travel slowly up the board doing as many actions as you can along the way. I love how the board gets more actions during the game when the players add more buildings. 
I definitively want to play this a whole lot more :)

I played this game last week, I was looking forward to it and it didn't disappointed me, we really had fun and enjoyed the game.

We were two, we had fun but I guess with 3 or 4 is more fun, we barely used the alternative routes with hazards.
There are many ways to get Victory points and that makes each turn fun, there is always something going on. With so many options to make victory points, you have to focus your strategy on some features not all, but you shouldn´t either abandon the other features. I forgot completely to get more objectives, which is a way to get VP with no costs.

The game is really well balanced.

Alexander Pfister is on an incredible roll. We haven't seen a run like this since Stephan Feld's 2007-2013 stretch, where every game seemed to be better than the last, with all of them being worthy of a greatest hits compilation. Great Western Trail is easily the best thing to come out of Essen 2016.

The game is sort of like Caylus, but with a deck building aspect. Players drive cattle from Texas to Kansas City, attempting to arrive at their destination with the highest value of collected cattle cards in their hand. The catch is that any duplicate cards are not counted. So the primary focus of each cattle run is to find a way to discard duplicate cards while at the same time adding higher valued cattle cards to your deck.

The Caylus vibe comes from the trail itself. It is a forking pathway that starts the game largely empty, but as the game moves on, becomes cluttered with player erected building spaces that both slow and tax anyone that passes over them. This makes every game unique but not random, since how each session develops is completely controlled by the player's actions.

The railroad aspect of the game feels a little tacked on, but I suppose it was something that was added in development, to soak up some money and keep things tight. Regardless, it works and gives everyone one more thing to think about when income from the cattle drive is collected, making that phase something more interesting than a simple clean-up phase.

The learning curve is a little steep for the first game, but once players have been through a full cattle drive, most of it comes together pretty well. I'd say it's about on par with Mombasa, as far as complexity goes. A mouthful to teach, but simple in turn to turn execution. Good stuff.

Everyone else around the table loved it, but I was rather underwhelmed. It's an OK game, but going through all these mechanisms and actions just wasn't that interesting to me. I didn't hate it, there are things to be enjoyed here, it's just that nothing that happened during the whole game was particularly exciting. There are many better euros to pick from. By the way, the iconography is very daunting, learning this game is not a particularly pleasant experience. 

/update: I've played it again, this time with 2 players. It was definitely a more pleasant experience, the mechanics finally came together. It's a good euro that requires a lot of careful planning. I just don't consider it to be as spectacular as others suggest (at least not yet). Still, I'm bumping my rating from 6 to 7. I would gladly play it again and explore new paths to victory as there's probably more to this game than meets the eye, especially when it comes to advanced strategies of route building and effective chaining of buildings.

Man this is good. I can't seem to win, but I love it. :)
Many different things to explain, but once you get going, it all flows naturally from one chunk to the next. It feels very intuitive, and you rarely look at the rules again (except for that blasted "special delivery" building...).

RATING: 9
I've played three times so far and each time I find a new rule! So that's a downside here. However, once you figure out how to actually play (or can read rules more thoroughly than I can) this is a fantastic game. I very much appreciate how differently the game can play each time and how there are myriad strategies to take. It honestly doesn't feel like there's one best approach and for that I appreciate it. I'm not sure where this game will be in a year, but I'll certainly ask to play it a bunch before then.

RATING: 9
Fantastic game. I feel like I'm always changing up my strategy from game to game based on which workers show up. The game greatly rewards in-depth planning but poor luck on draws can completely demolish your game. My only real complaint is that it can be difficult to block an opponent once they get their engine going although there are options (taking the workers they need, picking hazards, taking the best cows, etc).

This is the best example of what Eurogaming so often gets wrong. Absurdly complex rules that add no depth. The theme is very loose. There is almost no player interaction. The game takes twice as long to finish as it is enjoyable for. It's competent, but what a waste it is to have so much game development effort put into these entirely interchangeable and utterly bland VP optimization systems.

Driving cattle to Kansas City along a route with area movement and tile placement of buildings and obstacles with final sale and delivery by rail to the outlying cities in the Midwest.  Player boards have unlocks to enhance basic actions.  Hire Cowboys, craftsmen and engineers from the labor market that doubles as a game end countdown timer.  Set collection from identical cattle decks to build big cattle sale hands without duplicates.  Thin out the common low value jersey cow cards and add high value chocolate and purple cows for bigger sales.  A big part of the game is tile placement of your buildings in other rancher paths and handling obstacles and Indians on the trail.  There is a lot going on in this one with lots of tactical revisions.

This game has A LOT going on.  Fairly straight-forward as far as actions to choose from, but deciding what to do when can be quite the challenge.  Have only played once, as a learning game, and the teacher won with 91, I finished 2nd with 66, while 3rd place was 43.  I was somewhat handicapped because I forgot my glasses, which always sucks.  Next time!!

RATING: 10
Really fun and unique, multiple ways to victory and lots of choices to be made in this one. After ten plays, it still holds up as a clear 10/10 and my favourite board game of all time.

I have a feeling that GWT will end up in my Top 5 of all time for years to come.

Extra promos + third party extras: Station Tile promos, 11th Building Promo, canvas bags for the 1-3 worker types, clear acrylic boards.

EDIT: Rating raised to 9.5 on Feb 12th.

I like this one, and so does my wife. My kids find the theme a little too dry to get excited to play this one. The length is also rough for them. 2-player games we've gotten down to 1.5 hours, but for 4 players we struggle to finish within 2.5. I have a great time no matter the player count.

Long game with lots of moving parts. But they all work together very cleanly. The game is essentially a Rondel game, like Imperial or Navegador, but the rondel changes every game, and the rondel changes during the game as well. And their are certain spots that only you can benefit from. Very clever, very well done.

It is an ok Euro game. I love the theme though. 

GWT plays a bit like monopoly. Think about it. You go around the board, stopping off at locations and taking actions which require money. In certain places where an opponent has built an building or if there is a hazard, you must either pay your opponent or the bank.

Initially, it is hard to read the rules and translate what you have read into playing the game. There are some good video tutorials available which really help one's ability to digest the rules. There is a learning curve as well. Learning what each tile does will take a little bit of practice. With that said once you begin playing the game, it plays quite fluidly. The tiles will also become intuitive.

My favorite parts of the game are hiring workers, going to the cattle market and the train movement/Kansas city mechanism. Really unique and I enjoy these actions. They make it a good game.

However, the game is mostly a single-player solitaire - waiting for your turn Euro. In the game, there is minimal interaction or anything else to stir the pot of Cookie's beans. The game needs more excitement. Why not have tiles like Bad Bart's Hideout where cattle rustlers live or a branding/cattle count location which have good and negative effects on all players on the trail if the tile is played in the game, (in other words the actions one player takes on the tile affects his competitors, but if he does so, he also has to pay a price)? Why not add random cards mixed in with the achievement cards like stampede, flooding, or hostile Indians which affect people in certain pats of the trail? it might make the achievement cards more interesting. While the achievement cards are means for victory, at the same time the general feeling is that you don't want them because they crowd up your deck. Ideas like this would add more chili to Cookie's beans, thus making the cattle punchers farts that much stronger and essentially the game much more interesting. I am surprised things like cattle counting and/or cattle rustlers. flooding, hostile Indians (etc.) were left out of the game. These events happened and always make the plot for the best western movies! Indeed, there are hazards in the game, but they are simply avoided until it becomes more expensive not to avoid them by going the another way. Would interactivity make all of the passive-aggressive snowflake Euro gamers cry? Probably. For me, the lack of interaction is a major drawback and why the game does not deserve a higher rating. 

GWT is way overrated at 8.3.  I love western games. Very few games use the theme and then implement it well. The theme here is excellent. However, GWT will never replace Carson City. It does come in at a much lower second though. Carson City remains in my top 10.

While the rulebook was difficult to follow (I recommend watching a playthrough before reading), the game itself is one of those "easy to play, hard to master" type games. The iconography is EXCELLENT -- while there are many actions you may take, they all use the same "pieces" to assemble the icon and tell you what each space does. Even in the first games, I very rarely had to reference the rulebook because everything you need to know is present in the icons. The gameplay is a neat mix of light deckbuilding, hand management, and sort of a worker placement mechanism -- you decide which space(s) you want to stop on, as long as you're following the path and not exceeding your movement limit. Wonderful design.

A lot of moving parts. I don't think any individual mechanic in the game is ground breaking but they all come together very well. There IS luck in the deck-building part of the game but there are ways to mitigate this by thinning your deck etc.

Enjoyed this enough to pick up a copy, really liked the way set up and player behaviour can affect the game. Multiple strategies seem viable and may be more or less effective depending on the situation. This will replace Orleans in our collection as boxes compete for space on the shelf.

This game looks so boring on the cover. A game about herding cows to Kansas City and selling them.

The game is absolutely amazing. So many different paths, you can take and a higher replay value than it seems at first glance. 

There is a lot going on in this game but your turns are quick and simple: Move your meeple, do the action(s) on the location you stop at and then draw back up to your hand size. 

Superb game

I'm not [b]entirely[/b] sure how I feel about this yet, but I like it. Let me explain: The first time I played, my delightful opponents were (as one often is with a game like this) too absorbed with their strategies, tactics, and schemes to notice that I was erroneously [b]paying[/b] the amount of the chosen station at the end of the trail each time, and thus was always destitute. Ouch. I had an abysmal score. So, I taught someone else how to play the game — correctly, I believe — and I got spanked around the block, and ended with an even worse score. :laugh:

I also have concerns about the intentional bottleneck at the first turn on the trail, but I will just have to play it more, because [b]there is so much awesome about this game[/b]. Oh, except the meticulous sluice of prospective employees; that really feels like a lot more work than it needs to be for what it gives the game.

This game has a really bad complexity / fun ratio. You need to study the rulebook, rather than just read it, and even then it takes several plays before you no longer forget any detail rules. You need to set up an “engine”, but it’s really hard to get it rolling. One element that is really baked into the game is that you have to scoop the other players: snatch away the station tiles, get the best cattle cards, occupy the most favorable spots for your building tiles, grab the cheapest person tiles, get the best disaster tiles etc.  It can be somewhat frustrating if you feel that the scooping among players is out of balance. Finally, there is no score track that is updated during the game, so that it’s difficult to get a feeling how well you’re doing compared to the other players.

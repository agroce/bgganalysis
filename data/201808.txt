A fun deck-builder where the cards you play help you recruit adventurers, move around the dungeon, fight monsters, collect treasures and escape before the dragon would inevitably kill you.

Lovely production values, great artwork and a massive number of different cards in play in every game which means you're not just always choosing to buy repeats from a small set of choices (which is what bores me about Dominion).

RATING: 8
One of the *very* few 'deckbuilding with knobs on' games that spoke to me. I'm not a huge deckbuilding fan and typically prefer the pure ones like Puzzle Strike and Dominion, but this is up there with them. 

Love the press-your-luck and route planning aspects, as well as the deck 'archetypes' you can build towards :'Make all the Glodz', 'Gotta go Fast', 'Companions Assemble!' etc. A fair bit of luck in the game but given the game length I think most will find it acceptable. 

Minor complaint of the year: the box is annoyingly deep so it's hard to fit in my backpack!

Clank is probably my favorite deck-builder that I've tried, and I think Clank! In! Space! may prove to be even more successful. Since deck-building isn't my favorite mechanic, I appreciate that it's not the only part of this game (as it is in something like Dominion or Ascension), but there's a physical board to manage and interact with. 

Also, there's the Clank! mechanic which means I may have a less powerful deck than you, but I'm very quiet and have purged any clank cards, so I can sneak around with less risk than you can. I appreciate that balance that the game provides. It's still not my 'perfect deckbuilder' (I don't know if that game exists), but Clank! does come the closest.

Easy to teach, fun to play. Love the short playtime, the intuitive playtime, the tension as time runs out to escape the dungeon, and the exciting way deckbuilding is used in this game. It's just an incredibly enjoyable game. My one concern is whether it's replayable enough. I can already tell I'll want more cards and more boards (ideally many more boards). This is one where I think quality expansions will make all the difference. I'm a little disappointed that the only expansion out so far adds just one board; seems like two would have really been expected.

RATING: 6
3 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: Simple rules, and the big push-your-luck dragon element. The theme is light enough that dungeon crawling is not a big turn off, and being eaten by a dragon is good fun. Buying cards each round is interesting.

DISLIKE: Random bag draws can really suck. Little text on cards can be difficult to read. Wish it played a little bit faster, as some late game combos can get a little long.

OVERALL: It's fun, but after a few plays the depth is not there. I'm not a big fan of deckbuilding, but this one is not that bad as there isn't much "thinning" of your deck and the decisions are straightforward. The real game is in getting enough treasure and getting out.

Remember to keep black cubes out as they are pulled.

*TRADED: Good game but repetitive plays felt too similar, and I'm not a huge deck-building fan.

Full of fun, this is a well integrated deck builder with a hint of DungeonQuest. It rises and falls your your willingness to push your luck, escape with the most loot - or risk waking the dragon and taking it on the chin. The multiple resources also work quite well and the game is just out and out fun. I really like it. Two things make it not quite perfect: the card quality could be much better. And like all games of this type, it could use an expansion to increase card variety.

RATING: 4
Clank has lot of promise. Build your deck and loot treasure while moving aroud the board. Sounds fun alright.

There is one bug BUT, however. Luck of draw has a crazy huge impact on the player balance. One bad draw when opponent draws well might mean that you will ve trailing for the rest of the game since there is no catch up mechanism. And I really mean trailing, because you are supposed to move along a network of trails without too much of possibility to deviate from the path chosen by your opponents which basically means you will be moving through already looted (empty) area. 

Although there are two so called soft timers (damage and empty dungeon) it is basically on the players' responsibility to end the game. Here is one more annoying part of the design since the player ending the game will have to wait ages for the game to actually finish.

4 Plays, mainly 2p-3p.  Does better with 4p I'd imagine, will re-rate when I play with 4+.  Not a good deckbuilder, not enough trash cards.  Okay explore.  Unique combo of these items, but two average doesn't make a great game.  It would be a 4 as a pure deckbuilder and 4 as a exploring game, but a fun merging of these gives it a bit of a boost to a 6.  I thought this would be much better than it was, although still a good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Plenty of strategy and press your luck, and different but equally-fun gameplay at all player counts.  This is going to be in my collection for a really long time.

There is definitely some randomness that can really change the game (when certain types of cards come out, if someone takes a lot of early damage, etc), but it's become a family favorite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An easy to learn game and is thematic and has tactical decisions to boot.

The Clank mechanic is amazing and creates utter tenseness in the game and teaches one about the consequences and subsequent regret about earlier decisions for not preparing for one situation or another. 

A great game that I want to play again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
LOTS of fun.  Hope Clank! in Space! fixes the one issue I have, that it's hard to cycle cards out of your deck.  I play with a reduced starting deck - too easy to get a 'dead' hand which, for my crowd, was the only (very minor) downer.  In Space apparently has more purge cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Very much not for me.  I like deck builders, but the dragon/clank mechanics overshadow EVERYTHING.  And that means my choices are not always motivated by strategy or goal but often by fear and necessity.  There are just too many sticks and not enough carrots for my liking.

Our gateway game into real designer board games. Our most played and I'd still never turn it down. A fun mix of push your luck, a tiny bit of take-that, and some tactical deck building. I like that the game feels different at different player counts.

The only down side I find is possible player elimination in a 2 player game is terribly anti climactic, though is very rare for us.

I'll definitely get the expansion but we still enjoy vanilla clank plenty for now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Still liking this game a lot.  I am waiting for my normal deck building rage to set in every time I play this, but it has not happened yet.  Usually I find deckbuilders frustrating due to the amount of luck that comes into whether you pull out the combos in one hand enough times in the course of the game.  I am usually CURSED in those games and if it has any take that or engine destruction I get salty fast.  Clank feels like a very different animal, with much of the engine building replaced by the push your luck mechanic.

[Update]
Originally this game was a 9, but Clank! In! Space! made me drop it a little.  Some minor annoyances in the game that I didn't even realize were a problem were so nicely fixed with the In Space version that I am much more likely to pull that one out.

I hear there is still a big box expansion to Clank! coming in 2018 and I suspect many of the nice improvements to the system will be put in here.

Still an amazing game, and if I am teaching people who have not played a deck builder before, or if they are in general fairly new to boardgaming, I will pull out Clank (with the expansion).  Once they play a game of that I will see if they like the space theme as well and then move on to that.

I would not be at all unhappy playing this original still though.

I like this game, the simple premise of getting in and getting out with the dragon's artifacts.  I like how the deck building interacts with the board.  I like the length, the moments of tension, the push your luck, and the art.  I don't usually go for deck builders, but this one is a lot of fun.  

I would rate it higher if, well, it didn't have some of the same issues I have with all deck builders.

Quick and fun. Fairly easy to teach, especially if people are familiar with any standard deckbuilding game. There can be player elimination, which could turn some people off, but it's not cheap or sudden in any way. Consider getting the Renegade Games app to allow for solo play, and a variant on competitive that makes it harder in general.

I'm more a board gamer than a card gamer, so Clank's inclusion of a board makes all the difference for me. It's a light little press your luck adventure than can be played with two fairly quickly. 

Positives:

* Quick and light.
* Decent card variety.
* Drama of the dragon attacks.
* Multiple boards to play. 

Cons:

* The board is still a bit more disconnected from the events of a turn than I'd like. 
* It's effectively a race.
* Dragon needs attack triggers not under player control (i.e. if players aren't drawing from the deck with dragon cards, the dragon isn't attacking). Perhaps this is more of a 2 player issue.

Have yet to try it with more than 2. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I kind of wish there was a bit more to this game, but I understand why it's as light as it is. The dungeon delve tied into deckbuilding makes building your deck much more fun than something like dominion, and the tension surrounding the dragon bag draws keeps you on your toes until the end generally. But you have very little in the way of deck manipulation, and the scoring system is somewhat unsatisfying, so this ends up feeling more like an appetizer than a main course.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As if Dominion, Diamant and Dungeoneer had a messy night of passion.  Clank! asks how deep you dare venture into the dungeon to grab loot, at the risk of infuriating the resident dragon.  The deckbuilding enables you to move further, defend yourself and do fun stuff like teleport.  The deck is salted with monster cards and killing those earns you money to spend at some deep dungeon market places.  Then there are those clank cards, which have you making noise and more likely to suffer some flame grilling by the dragon.  Clank! is good knockabout fun.

I liked the card art, but the board is dark and dull.  Production quality is good.

If you enjoy deck building, fiddling with oodles of card effects, and the theme of exploring a dungeon with monsters, you should definitely try Clank.  It is well designed for what it aspires to be:  a deck building dungeon exploration experience.

As for me, I find the mechanic of deck building to be far too solitary a social gaming experience, kind of like playing Yahtzee with cards (eventually, we all stop paying attention to each other as we draw our five cards, hopeful that lady luck will be on our side), and the dungeon with monsters theme to be tired.  Zzzzzz.  Been there, done that.  Because I don't ever want to play Clank again, have to give this otherwise well designed game a 5, since a 6 rating suggests I would be willing to play it again if I were in the right mood.

Clank is ... fine.  It's not exceptional, but it's not intolerable either.

In brief, I find Clank to be a game at odds with itself.  It wants to let you build a deck full of cool cards and make neat combos, but it also enforces a pretty active set of timers to ensure you never get to spend that long in the dungeon building up.  It tries to ask you to push your luck, but there isn't enough there to warrant it.  
A game with some alright ideas more propped up by a bunch of shiny cards in a deck you don't get to see a ton of each game than the strength of its design.  *shrug*

Ok I hate deck building games yet I really like this game I don't know if it's the theme, the simplicity of the deck building or if it's the job that the cards do in relevance to the movement / actions on the board.  Love the push your luck aspect of it as well.

For all the hype, I guess my bar was set kind of high.  Right off the bat, I think my main gripe was with the setup.  It's a bit fiddly to make sure all the pieces are in the right place and randomized.  The play was okay, but at it's core, it's a deckbuilder with some press your luck.  For deckbuilding, I'd rather play something like VoTK where setup is pretty quick and compact.  Traded this one on.

Let's see if all of this buzz is right.

1-5-18 - I've been able to play it more now with full player counts.  Something is not quite as satisfying as I would like.  The centralized draw deck struggles from the same randomness as Ascension and Star Realms making it hard to build a long-term strategy.  It feels like it could either be a quick loot-and-go or a deeper dungeon delve, but in play, doesn't quite feel like either.  The loot-and-go play tends to lose out to others who stay in the dungeon longer and the deck building of that strategy is not satisfying.  The deeper dungeon delve is very dependent on good luck or an overwhelming deck build.  The ability to heal and remove clank can make some players invincible. Rated at a 7.

Feels more like a Dungeon Delve then a deck builder. But building your deck is a major part of the game and I didn't mind at all. I recommend everyone give this game a try because it made a Believer out of me. Played it at least 6 times in 4 days. Changes each time I play it.

A deck building game with a board.  Sign me up.  This game is fantastic.  Depending on the type of players that you are playing with it can be a half an hour or it could go for upwards of two hours.  Everyone starts with a ten card deck of all the same cards.  You purchase new cards for your deck to give victory points at the end, improve movement, give more attack, or just help out in general.  The object is to go in, get the most valuable loot, and get out before the dragon kills you.  If you die in the depths all the work you put into collecting loot and improving your deck goes to waste and your score is not counted so make sure to get down there quick and get out.

I feel like almost every non-Dominion deckbuilder does or will wear out its welcome very quickly, and haven't found exception here. It's neat to mix the concept of pushing your luck with deckbuilding, but I feel like a static board layout is doomed to optimization, or at least memory-domination by players of even slightly more experience in terms of when it "feels" appropriate to return with others all over the map. It's still fun, and I'd still play it, but I don't see it having very long legs at all.

After a bunch of plays over the past two weeks, I'm upping my rating to a 9.  I'm much more of a euro gamer.  But this game just strikes a perfect chord with me, the family, and gaming groups.  It's just so much fun.  Yes, there's luck but who cares?  There are ways to mitigate (not eliminate) the luck.  The mechanics are solid and work together with the theme and artwork so well.  It's solid, it's silly and it's tense.  Can't get enough of this one.  The expansion makes the game even better.

Clank! is one of the best games we own. Hands down, we have played this more times than any other game in our collection. We have taught this to almost all of our friends. This game follows the basic deck-builing guidelines where players start with a standard deck, and through gameplay will purchase more powerful cards to add to it. During your turn, you will cycle through your deck by drawing and playing cards in front of you. The cool thing about Clank! your cards let you move and explore around a board via boot icons. So, it's not just about buying and playing cards. The board depicts a dragon's lair, and we are the brave (stupid) souls who have decided to relieve her of her riches. Players will dive ever-deeper into the dungeon to steal ancient artifacts from the sleeping beast, but as you can imagine, burglary of precious jewels can be a bit noisy. She begins to wake up! Time's running  out, and now it's a race against your friends. Who will get away with the most valuable goods, and who will die trying? 9/10.

Amazing spin on deck building, with all the elements you'd expect plus a fun board to explore and push-your-luck through.

Truly awesome stuff here.

Deep Sea Adventure as a dungeon deck-builder. I have to give this an eight simply because it is such a hit with my wife, which is amazing since she hates themes related to dungeons and dragons. The appeal is all down to the tight, unpredictable game of chicken.
The deck-building is a fine balance between cards that give you movement, fighting ability, income to buy more cards, and various special abilities, but however well you build your engine, there's always other players to throw your plans off course by grabbing loot you want and annoying that pesky dragon.
As in the best horror films in which you never see the monster, the dragon makes no appearance in the game, but its increasingly hostile off-board presence is what ramps up the tension as first one then the other players decide they've gone quite deep enough and bolt for the surface. In Deep Sea Adventure, if you're too deep and too slow, you drown; in Clank! you fry.

First impressions were good, but I'm not sure this has the legs to stay in my collection.  I need to try this on the more difficult side of the map.  Not bad, but deck-builders are a crowded market and I'm not yet sure if this rises to the top.

Ez a második térképes Dominion-származék a Trains után, amit próbálok. a Trains is sokkal jobban tetszett a Dominionnál, és ez is, bár ez kevésbé letisztult volt nekem, meg a célcsoport is más. Ez kalandozós, majdnem családi szint. A sérülés része nagyon ötletes, az lehetne a játék védjegye. A győzelmi pontok annyiféle tokenen fordulnak elő, hogy az már röhejes. Ami egy jó dilemma a játékban, hogy mikor induljunk el kifelé. Én hamar kiértem, bezsákoltam a +20 pontot, azt hittem ezzel nyerő leszek, de a többiek még 3 körig bóklásztak odalent, mielőtt meghaltak, az alatt bőven 20 pont felett gyűjtögettek. Szóval nem éri meg kirohanni, legalábbis most így érzem első parti után.
Összességében egy színes kis kalandjáték, maga a pakliépítős rész semmi extra, ez a térképről szól.

Fun and exciting. There is a nice amount of press your luck which really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Theme is spot on, components are great--really, everything from flavor text to game mechanics are perfectly proportioned. 

It's not the most complex game in the world, but theme, high stakes, and great deck building mechanics keep you invested in every turn of this game.

Gra, w której dużo zależy od szczęścia, ale to nie jest minusem. Przemyślana mechanika zazębia się bardzo dobrze z tematem, który jest wyraźnie odczuwalny. Gra się przyjemnie, a liczba możliwych akcji pozwala dostosować swoje poczynania do darów losu, więc można nad tą losowością panować. Pozytywne odczucia.

Not sure why I was late to the party with this one, maybe it's because its a deck builder and my only previous experience of deck building was the dreary artic scavengers.

But wow, this game is just amazing. It hits a sweet spot. Components are great and it kind of has a feel of an old time game that I would play as a kid, with the movement around the board but with modern day mechanics.

The deck building is simple and the choice of cards to build your deck is fun and interesting and not too heavy or serious.

I'm a sucker for push your luck so that side of the game was always going to appeal, but all the other elements and mechanics just gel really well.

This has been a big hit in our family. Turns move quickly and the game does not outstay its welcome

It's yet another deck builder... this time with a board.  I can't say that I'm all too excited about this game, at least not as much so as many others.  I think this is largely in part due to all the deck building games I already own and have played.  I think it isn't any worse than the others that I own, but don't feel that it is all that much better than the others that I own either.

Relatively light deck-building adventure game with an exploration theme
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A fun, quick-playing deck-building game that provides a sense of adventure. It can be played with non-gamers, and the push-your-luck aspect should keep more experienced gamers involved and happy. The cards that can be added to your deck are varied, interesting and powerful. The combination of moving over the board and playing cards makes for satisfying turns and quick game sessions. It's just fun.

The biggest negative for me right now relates to the more "advanced" side of the board, which seems to slow down the fun, quick adventure romp that this game wants to be.

***Edit, Jan. 2018: This game suffers a bit due to its lack of modularity in the board set up. The variation in the cards just doesn't quite maintain a freshness to the game. The expansion board helps keep the game fresh. Additionally, after playing The Quest for El Dorado, the facile nature of the deck-building in Clank is highlighted. El Dorado manages to squeeze in a much more strategic-style deck builder into a package that is just as accessible as Clank. The theme is more present in Clank and some people may prefer the push-your-luck of Clank versus the straight race of El Dorado. However, in view of the facile deck-building in Clank and the ability to play it out relatively quickly, I'm revising this rating.

A great casual deck builder.  Not sure how I feel about the rush home and see if others make it mechanic, feels like 1 player sets the length of the game is a bit of a vulnerable mechanic.  Not an issue with 2 but still overall there is a good amount of accessible fun to be had here.

This is the rare deck-builder style game that I actually enjoy. The board with all it's pathways and markets and options gives me the hook I need so I don't just sit there and stare at my cards while wondering what better games I could be playing. I do really like the hybrid push-your-luck/race/clank mechanics. Do you grab something early and get out...or do you get greedy?

Brian and I also tackled Clank! Saturday night. I won a close game, 110-103. I won't mention rules too much as this is already a super popular game here on BGG so most people already know about it. If you don't know about it and like deck building and/or dungeon crawl style games, GET THIS!!!!!

This is just so much fun. there are several different push your luck elements going on here. You have to manage how much Clank you take with the cards you purchase, you have to decide how deep in the dungeon to go to get an Artifact and how long to stay in there getting points. Brian and I both went equally deep into the dungeon. There is also a lot of strategy in when you purchase cards because of the Dragon icon that appears on about 1/3 of them. If you see your opponent with a bunch of Clank cubes on the board, buy multiple cheap cards in the market to hopefully trigger an attack!

I also enjoyed the random element with the major and minor secrets. They are all good things to get, some are just better than others. 

Lastly, there is a lot of replayability in this game. A double sided board (the other side looks brutal) and a huge deck of cards means games are always going to run differently. This will probably make my Top 100. I own the Sunken Treasures expansion and will get that played soon as well.

This is the best family game I own. My 9 year old loves it, I love it, my wife loves it. I love the theme, I love the RPG fantasy feel, I love the short length, I love the sense of progression via deck building akin to Mageknight's system with a strong push your luck gamblers vibe. It's just great, have had it for a week and already have half a dozen plays.

Clank! is deck-building, push-your-luck game kind of like Dominion meets Incan Gold. Movement on the board can be a struggle, but it's all about grabbing valuables and heading out of the dragon's lair. The deeper you go, the bigger the treasures and the harder it is to get out. I hope I get a chance to play it again, but I doubt it will have lasting power.

This is a deck building game where you dive into the dungeon to try to get the most loot, but still make it out alive. The deck-building works, and the push your luck aspect based on the other players is a fun mechanic that usually doesn't rush you too much, but can depend on who you play with. 

I now know that I actually  njoy the sequel "Clank in Space" more due to it's more clear markings, higher variability, and more balanced gametime, but I still enjoy the OG Clank!

NOTE: I now never play with the Magic Carpet card, as each game I've played with it, if someone gets it then they end up winning do to its OP ability for vast movement compared to everyone else.

Dungeon Quest meets dominion.  Games featuring deck building, where deck building is just one mechanism in the game have generally been interesting, and this one was no exception.

Will probably always be willing to play this when suggested, I love this game. It's a blast! Everyone we've shown it too has loved it as well.

Been really happy with it, worth every cent!

The vanilla game has a few nagging quirks. My rating comes with the caveat that certain variants are used.

- Only 20 back cubes are placed in the dragon bag
- Once an adventure exits the dungeon, players have only three turns before "passing out" 
- Left over coins equal one point for every two gold.
- Refined balance to certain cards

RATING: 8
Ascension with a board - certainly gives more a feeling of dungeon delving than ascension does (although Ascension is probably my most played iOS app).

For deckbuilding melded with a board I prefer Tyrants of the Underdark, just feels there's a bit more player interaction there. In this it's limited to getting out first or the occassional card that gives your opponent clank! or buying cards in the hope of triggering a dragon attack.

Saying that, still enjoyable. However I wonder how much staying power it has out of the box. The cards are 'similar' and there is just two maps with fixed points for the artifacts. I suspect an expansion would help freshen it up once the card pool feels stale. For now, like it, alot :)

Brilliant, light game design with a patina of story.  Inspired.

Es un deck builder.. un "remake" del dominion, pero con tablero. Las cartas pueden tener valor económico para comprar otras cartas, botas para moverte por el tablero y espadas, para hacer frente a los enemigos.
Además, las cartas te permiten hacer otras cosas y demás. Una de ellas da el nombre al juego, y es el clank. Cuando haces ruido el mosntruo de las mazmorras se enfada y cuando hay un ataque del dragon, cuanto más ruido hayas hecho, más posibilidades tienes de salir herido.
Se trata de adentrarte en una mazmorra, conseguir algún trofeo y salir sano y salvo, antes de que el dragón se cebe contigo.
Sencillito de reglas, pero muy divertido.

Interesting enough I guess. The problem is that deck-builders have to be
compared to Dominion, and I just don't see the replay value on this one.
While the board allows for a movement element missing in other fantasy-themed
deck-builders, it doesn't go far enough to really engage me in this being more than a deck-builder; too, it is limited to fixed boards, leaving the randomness of exploration out of the experience.

Decent mix of deck building and press-your-luck. Good length, theme, and overall gameplay. One thing I didn't like was because of the specific paths you take, it felt like you could get screwed by a bad draw more than in most other deck builders. I.e., you had more  instances where you need to draw specific cards. Otherwise, pretty good.

This saw some really fast and furious play for the first few weeks we had it. Now we've slowed our furor, but this has still got to be my favorite game that I've played in a long while. I love the comedy in this game, when anyone dies, especially me, I find it utterly hilarious. And the mechanisms are great. I love card games as it is, but adding in one of my true guilty pleasures, draw bags? Such great fun. The theme here pulls the game together and makes it much more than a deck-builder with a board.

Got the expansion, absolutely love it. I'm interested to see what they continue to do with this game, and I'm worried for extra expansions overloading the game with too many cards. For now though, this is exactly what I need. Very thrilled.

Edit: I think four players is too many for us with this game. It might just be that I always seem to introduce it to new players, but I think with four there's too much downtime. Lately my games have been taking longer than I feel they should in general. That's the main flaw that detracts from this for me, that the pace is unpredictable and can become sluggish, especially with more players. Rating has fallen slightly.

Un divertido deck-building con tablero... es muy gracioso que mientras un jugador intenta sigilosamente llegar hasta el fondo de la mazmorra otro puedo ir como un elefante dentro de una cacharrería. El juego en general está muy bien logrado y el tema pega mucho tanto como para que sientas el miedo cada vez que el dragón ataca y haya que sacar cubitos de la bolsa.

I've been waiting for my FLGS to get me in a copy of Clank! for a long time... When it finally showed up I couldn't wait to give it a go so we played it with two players. Honestly I don't think this game works very well with two players. The board was fairly open and there just didn't seem to be much competition or rush between the two of us. I really like what this game tries to do though and I can't wait to try it with higher player counts. If this game is as good with 3 or 5 players as I think its going to be I expect it to get a lot of table time.

Wow, this is so much more fun than I expected it to be.  It is an interesting challenge to build a deck that provides a good combination of mobility, buying power, and combat strength while still trying to maintain flexibility.  Running through the dungeon scarfing things and trying to get out before being eaten is a blast.  

I don't normally like Ascension-style deck building because of the randomness of what cards are available to you on your turn, but in Clank it works reasonably well because combos are not that important, so you can usually find something worth buying on your turn.

Nice artwork, and the color text is priceless!  Great job Dire Wolf & Renegade!

Really enjoying this, although it's not super-deep. Gamers may want to tighten it up a bit though, either by removing 4-6 black cubes from the bag, or removing the Shrines (which recycle black cubes) from the game. Hopefully we can get a couple new maps at some point; this will need some novelty to stay alive long-term (or even medium-term).

Deckbuilding meets dungeon crawl, two styles of games that I do not particularly enjoy. The game did howver also add an interest element of push-your-luck into the mix with the "clank!" resource. The game is fun and the artwork has a nice, fantasy appeal to it, but ultimately the game is bit too random and luck-based for my taste.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Enjoyed this one as a more solid implementation of push your luck coupled with deck building. There's a lot of disparate elements here and it can appear messy (particularly with a long setup), but it comes together pretty well to produce a solid experience. The tempo does seem a bit wobbly here as players can force the end earlier than perhaps the game wants, resulting in a less satisfying experience. Also, like most deckbuilders, I really only want to play this with people who play at a good speed and keep the game moving.

Overall a really solid game and one I'd happily play given experienced opposition.

RATING: 8.5
I bought this game the second it came back in stock at Miniature Market, and I was not at all disappointed by my decision.  This game is so much fun, and even though the dragon very very rarely affects the game I like that it is there as a timer for the game, and to keep the theme going, and it is dang fun. Even the expansion adds so much to the game.

Based on 1 play with 3 players:

Sets a new high bar for how deckbuilding can mesh with board play. The push-your-luck elements are a great way to add some spice and up the fun/drama factor. Would make an excellent (possibly the new best) intro to deckbuilding for a gaming newbie.

The only thing really holding me back from total adoration is simply that the deckbuilding is Dominion basegame-level straightforward. It works, your combos just aren't super interesting or clever. The fact that the card market is random (ala Ascension, Star Realms) doesn't really help here either - sometimes you're just gonna feel like you didn't have the opportunity to put your deck together the way you want to.

That said, the person who won our first game had the best deck by FAR... so I'm not really concerned with this game being totally random. The random elements feel appropriate for Clank's theme and weight. There's a good chance I'll be picking this up to play with all my friends who prefer light, thematic games.

*7* (Initial plays)
Solid deck building game with a push your luck mechanic. The cards are straight forward with little text. Best parts of the game have to be the pushing your luck to go deeper into the dungeon and the fear of making too much noise and alerting the dragon. I'm not sure if this one holds much replay value but it's certainly worth playing a few times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This one is a lot of fun.  Fills the deckbuilding itch while providing a theme in which to do it - raid the dungeon, steal the treasure, run for your lives.

The "dragon attack" with the Clank! cubes makes for some serious tension as you hope that none of your cubes come out.  The fact that once a dragon cube is removed and not replaced, in conjunction with the increase in removed cubes as you steal more loot, means you have to be very, very careful about how much "Clank!" you generate during your turn.

Overall a really fun game, and one of my more liked "deck builders" that are primarily "deck builders".

Another deckbuilder with a board similar to Trains but better as the theme comes through more for me. You're trying to get deep in the dungeon to get a valuable artifact and get back out before the dragon or the dungeon get to you first. It would serve as a good next step gateway game in my opinion especially for those that like fantasy. In our play I ended up losing by a fair amount and I'm not quite sure why. Maybe it was luck of the draw but I feel everyone needs to go heavy into moving in order to be competitive with skill and fighting being a second priority. Another play is needed to see if this is worth keeping in the collection.

Fun little family type game that is not overly thinky but does have some meat to it in spite of the luck element. The game itself is easy to understand and learn. The learning curve is getting to know the cards and how each would benefit your deck as you build it. It real fun is the press your luck element of knowing that you could end up eliminated if you don't get out of the dungeon in time vs. needing to grab sufficient artifacts (points) to win. Fun game. The one down side is the quality of the cards. They feel a little flimsy. Minor quibble for a fun adventure.

Played my first game on 7/15/17 with my 11y daughter, and 6y daughter and 3y son. We had a wonderful experience! I must say the deck building with a board is the way to go! I only wish the board was modular though for replay value. My 11y daughter who doesn't play many games out side of Ticket to Ride and Cover your assessets caught on easily and had lots of fun! Our 6y daughter who only plays cover your assessets loved the game too and was able to play with only about 55% help from Dad. She loved the clank cubes and would close her eyes and cross her fingers each time her little brother 3y who was the dragon would reach in and pull out the clank cubes indicating damage from the dragon. We loved it, after playing the first game my 6y immediately said lets play it again!!!  Great family game, keep them coming!

I like dungeon crawls, I like "push your luck" style games l and I like deck builders but man was I disappointed by this one ! 
I was expecting a game full of tension but there is no sense of danger at all : it plays like a boring pick up and deliver. And it looks very bland too.
The game needs a lot of tweaking in order to be fun : at least a dozen cards have to be rebalanced. More importantly, the "low clank" tactic breaks the game by making the dragon useless. 
We will not keep it unless we develop smart house rules.

Update: This has been a huge hit with my family. On paper, this doesn't rise above a 6 for me, but in practice, it's been a lot of fun. Looking forward to expansions. I'm still not sure about the balance of a few cards.
---
I'm not a huge deckbuilder fan, but I did like that there's a board with a very basic quest structure on top of the code deckbuidler mechanic. But given that the set of standard cards is so small (only 2 standard cards you can buy), there's not a lot of planning you can do, which makes it sort of a silly fun game at best. Kinda reminds me of Diamant (Incan Gold? or whatever it's called now), where you try to see how deep you can do. But you gotta also make it out. Kinda also like [thing=169654][/thing] in that respect.

The more I play this game, the more I love it, even as I see it's flaws.  I love the central mechanic & the overall simplicity of the cards.  I love the humor.  I really love the Clank mechanic, as it's always high drama.

That being said, the game has definite flaws.  In particular, it can be a little prone to being screwed by one guy who gets too good of an early set of turns.  People can really hose things by grabbing the fast thing and getting out.  I hear that the expansion and/or Clank in Space do this better.  Still, this one is very frequently requested for our table.

First impressions after one play: It was a lot of fun, but I do think that was mainly because of the novelty. I very much enjoyed the push-your-luck aspect, and the fact that the game has three currencies makes it feel different and more challenging. The card effects just weren't very interesting though. There were not very many card combos at all. For me, a good deck-building game should have an engine-building aspect to it in which you get more powerful as the game goes on as you're able to pull off more combos. The Clank! cards and cardplay were just boring, and I really didn't feel much more powerful at the end of the game than at the start. The Dungeon Deck row stagnated frequently as players were afraid to take a card from that row unless it was very good. Here's hoping the expansion addresses these deficiencies. For now at least, Marvel Legendary still reigns supreme as the deck-building game to beat, especially if interesting cardplay is desired.

Tentatively giving this one an 8 thanks mainly to the cool theme, great artwork, and my penchant for dungeon crawlers, but I still haven't quite decided how I feel about it. The market row deckbuiling mechanic is inherently flawed, and getting good cards comes down to pure dumb luck a lot of the time. If you're lucky enough to get cards that let you thin your deck of crappy starter cards early in the game one can easily snowball their way to victory based on this alone (ask me how I know this :/ ). Still, I have mostly enjoyed my playthroughs of this game so far. We'll see how I feel about it after another ten or so. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This was disappointing.  There were several flaws that were not offset by the presence of a board, which really didn't add much of interest.

First, the card play is not nearly as interesting as something like Ascension, where you can ramp into some powerful combos.  Here, the cards are all pretty boring, and only a few work together.

Second, the push-your-luck element of the Dragon seems really unbalanced.  Early on when you are buying lots of cards, you will trigger lots of dragon attacks.  This will put a lot of damage on everyone.  But then, near the end, when all cards in the market are crap, no one will buy anything and the dragon won't attack anymore.  You're in more danger of staying down too long and not making it back, but there are other games that do that better.

Finally, it is really swingy.  If you get good bonus draws, or can buy better cards (like the gems) you can gain a huge advantage.  It's also easy to be stuck somewhere that takes 2 move to get out of, but you never draw that.  At least in other games the cards you draw *do* something, but here, you're trapped, and maybe you could buy something crappy if you're lucky.

Nice idea, wanted to like it, ended up disappointed.

An excellent deck builder with a great theme. Using your deck to move around a dungeon, fight monsters and collect loot really sets this apart from other deck builders that I have played. 
The noise (Clank!) mechanic really opens up the strategy for players, will you try to creep around looting where you can, or just blaze through the dungeon, clanking as you go, and then hope to escape the dungeon with your loot before the dragon eats you?
The latter is my wife's favourite tactic, and she has been caught in the last room before the exit in two separate games now.  :)

This is a fun deck builder that requires you to press your luck, grab the goods deep in the dungeon and escape, but watch out as when you make noise, you can awaken the dragon. This game is a little too much luck dependant with a few factors that contribute to this and the lack of variety in the map will limit multiple strategies and replayibility. Despite this, the game is fun. (Sleeved in Dragon Shield Clear Matte)

It technically isn't the first game to have deckbuilding to maneuver around a board. But it still feels innovative. The game is cute and full of great art and great puns. The theme is endearing.

Not a bad deck builder with a nice dungeon theme and a push your luck mechanic. It has been fun on each of our plays, but I get the feeling it will become samey after half a dozen or more plays. I think that there needs to be more direct interaction between the players...some way to maybe lay down traps or send monsters to attack others. Without that, it's just a case of push your luck and hoping others don't get lucky. A variable map would be nice as well...perhaps using map tiles instead of a board.

A neat mix of exploration and deck building. A decent amount of replayability with the double sided different layout board. No one path to victory as you can push for a small or deep exploration for a short or long game. Card purchases also swing how long or short the game you want to be and how you'll get points best.

Art is nice and card quality is decent but may need sleeving to prevent chipping.

Will most definitely be picking this game up!
  
Was fortunate enough to play a round of this with 3 others that had not played it before.  We were all fairly experienced gamers and have all played traditional deckbuilding games before.  The rules were simple to understand with a deckbuilding foundation.  As the game ramped up there was definitely a rise to tension and a sense of urgency to escape before the dragon had his way with us.  Was a great experience and CANNOT wait to play this with friends and family!  It is a much welcomed refresh to the deckbuilder genre.  10/10 Will play again.

Enjoyed this. Unfortunately, I got a bit greedy at the end - rather than just concentrating on getting to the exit (which would probably have given me the win, since i had a lot of treasure), I hung back to get some more, believing I had plenty of movement cards left in my deck to get out in time. But only got single-moves, when I was stuck needing a double.

Very fun deck builder/ dungeon crawler mashup. 

Feel as if the dungeon crawler aspect gets held back a bit by the deck builder aspect, but not enough to call it a flaw. Sometimes bad draws can force you to go a different path than you originally wanted to, but that just goes with the randomness of the game!

2 starting maps with 2 expansion maps keeps games interesting for many plays.

Definitely recommend sleeving the cards. Constant shuffling will damage them quick.

Clank is the first deckbuilding game that I feel like is successfully moving the genre a little step forward. Don't get me wrong, Dominion still reigns over the category for me, but Clank offers some different elements that I enjoy, including adding a little more fun and interactive elements.

First, the board concept is wonderful and adds a sense of of exploration that so many other deckbuilders will just try to incorporate in the cards. The push-your-luck aspect (How far do I push for the higher victory points?) adds a different twist to Dominion's "How soon do I start clogging my deck up with victory points?"

But my favorite part of the game is watching to see who gets out the dungeon alive. It's that feeling of: "Yes I want to see my opponents die so I can win, but I'm secretly cheering for them to escape at the last moment for the drama."

My sole gripe at the moment is that I feel like the cards are a little "meh."  There's no real sense of trying to put together a great combo or strategic decisions on which cards to play, since you have to play them all on a turn.

If the game grows in popularity and delivers more through expansions, it could climb up my list.

Great deckbuilding in this game - with interesting card powers to consider buying.  No matter your strategy, movement (footprints) is key.  

Seems to scale well with 2-4, but more players definitely takes longer.  Even when planning a turn in advance, it can still take some time to work everything out by your turn (new cards to potentially purchase, new situation on the board, etc.).  But after several plays, it smooths out and speeds up.  The minor/major secrets all over the board are fun and enticing when deciding where to move.  

Definitely been some pressure filled moments near the end of the game as players rack up health damage.  When one person escapes (or dies), the dragon comes out much more regularly.  Getting killed by the dragon is not uncommon.  

Great design, great theme, fun cards and art.  It's a hit for us.

(Sunken Treasures expansion is a nice edition - two cool new boards, a few new things to consider)

Given my love for deckbuilders, I bought this game on a whim at Spiel 2017. Turns out, this was a good choice. While it doesn't have the combo building potential of other deckbuilders and the cards are more on the bland side, the whole package works for me. It's just fun to delve into the dungeon and collect as many points as possible while keeping an eye on what the other thieves are up to.

Initially, I was a little bit worried that the more or less static map might be a problem and would make each game play more or less the same way. But until now (4 games in), the random treasure distribution, the ever changing card row and the different approaches of the other players were enough to let the games play out quite differently. This might change with more plays but the good thing is that I can unwrap Clank! In! Space! then and see how it mixes things up. :-)

So, while Clank! is definitely not the most involved deckbuilder, I would not hesitate to bring it to table again. Fun stuff.

Theme is fun, and I love the concept of "loot" as cards you get into your deck, but far too much chance. Turn 2-3 completely define your game (and if you don't get something good, but other players do, you just lose...). Game feels short, and the theme can kinda fall flat during the game. Overall, a disappointment, and generally pretty "meh" for me.

I have only played a few times so far, but I love it! Using the companion app to get a hang of the rounds and play some solo games, I find the game really keeps you on edge with the cube drawing system. Like most deck builders, your future choices are only as good as your previous draft choices. I am sure over time I will want more than the default 100 dungeon cards, but I have some time before that!
Can't wait to get some multiplayer going!

RATING: 2
Fleshes out deck building with other tried and true mechanisms, which is nice, but innovates on none of them.

Retains the strategic shortcomings of other deck builders: defense is worse than offense (lower points, situational), cards that allow you to search your discard should be avoided (situational), if you gain X buying power you must buy Y,  the OP card, of which there are few. If you win most of that card you probably win the game, so playing out the decks you've built is a bit of a formality; you already know whose is stronger. Bad draws can change the result, though without making it more satisfactory.

Edit: This is a first! I'm adding to my comment while playing! But this is 4p Clank so I have plenty of time between turns... This game was decided on t1. As with all old school db'ers early advantages snowball out of control. This is the most tedious, pointless gaming experience I've had in quite some time. I can count on one hand the number of times I've picked up my phone at a gaming table, but this just couldn't wait:

A competitive deckbuilding game merged fantastically with a board / dungeon crawler.  Cards allow players to buy more cards, fight monsters, or travel through the board (dungeon) to find treasure.  Players often make noise called Clank which can anger the dragon living in the dungeon.

I'm not sure whether this is a 6 or 7.   I might be too generous.  It's a push-your-luck deck-builder.  Basically how long should you play.  The longer you play, the more points you get.  But if you play too long, you will get less, perhaps none.  I do think new players tend to leave the dungeon too soon and lose badly.  Better to risk not getting out to be in contention.

RATING: 4
Players are dungeon diving explorers trying to build a deck of cards that will allow them to move, defeat monsters and amass treasure.  Neat deck builder, with a board game element, and a genuine sense of pressure due to the dragon who is slowly waking from his slumbers.  Anybody read The Hobbit?  The "clank" mechanic where noise accelerates your demise is well done.  I liked it, despite some concerns over the luck of the draw - you are definitely hostage to the current cards in the Market when your turn comes around.

Rating dropped to 3 - board split on the lightest of back folding to flatten it out.  Cheaply printed, overpriced, smells terrible... basically an okay game but very poorly produced.

Clank! feels a bit to me like eating at one of those expensive little restaurants that gives you a microscopic taste of food rather than a full meal. Each time I play Clank! I want to experience it more deeply, but I can't tell if there just isn't too much there, or if my family plays this so competitively that we never get to see just how deep it is. The theme and artwork are great, the rules are fairly easy to understand. As we're experiencing it, it needs something, but I'm not sure what. The cool thing is that we keep bringing it to the table to find out.

Just received this game a few days ago. My wife and I love it. It's a fantastic 2-player game. The deck-building mechanic works great, and provides a number of strategic avenues to follow (boots over swords, swords over boots, gold generation, etc.) for victory. We have yet to add any other players, but I am looking forward to doing so as it will rotate the Dungeon Cards quicker, and create a more tense atmosphere (more dragon attacks and more players on the board taking items). As an introduction into Deck Building, this has been a great experience. We will be on the lookout for others.

A first class deck-builder - the best since Dominion?

I am a massive Dominion fan, one of my greatest games, and every deck builder since has disappointed me. But Clank! is different. There is something very intuitive about the game play and something very entertaining about the race element. It reminds me of playing a more complex version of Deep Sea Adventure in a world of Dominion. I have been mightily impressed. We played our first game and played a second game straight after the first, it was THAT good.

[thing=36218][/thing] derivatives have been numerous over the years but for me none has ever completely successfully wedded the full deck building experience into a game on a board...until now.  

[thing=201808][/thing] successfully uses the core Dominion mechanic (draw a hand of 5 cards, do stuff, buy more cards, fold your hand) within a spatial maze.  The two principal ingredients of Dominion are present: money to buy more cards and VPs on cards.  Three new currencies are introduced: movement of your piece on the board,  power to attack monster cards in the draw pile which give instant benefits, and finally the bad currency of Clank.  Build up too much Clank and you could get eliminated if the Dragon gets annoyed.  Elimination triggers the game end so fear not.

The interesting bit is the board:  a maze (dungeon) which you move through trying to pick up treasure (VPs).  The deeper you go, the higher the reward.  Once you have treasure you can leave the dungeon which triggers the game end.  Then everyone else tries desperately to get out, or at least get away from the deepest parts of the dungeon as that would mean death.

What makes the game so appealing is the combination of deck-building with a little push-your-luck (in terms of the end game escape), and the Clank mechanic which is exciting and just plain FUN!   

It is a game which has an in-built sense of humour: not in the sense that it is overlaid in a gratuitous layer over the top, but simply in the way it makes you feel when you play it.  

Clank is entertaining, no question.

Clank! is a light-medium weight deck building game where players enter a dungeon in search of treasure.  Certain rooms in the dungeon contain artifacts and mysteries that have point values or bonuses.  Each player starts with the same basic deck of 10 cards, some provide movement, some provide skill points, and a couple cards force the player to add "clank" cubes.

Skill points are used to purchase better cards to add to your deck or cards that are worth victory points.  Anytime a "dragon attack" card comes up, all of the clank cubes are added to a draw bag and a certain number of cubes are drawn.  If a player's cube is drawn, that cube is added to the player's wound track.  The more noise you make while traversing the dungeon means the higher chance the dragon will attack you.  If your wound track gets full, you've just been knocked out.  The first player to exit the dungeon or get knocked out triggers the end game count down.  The player with the most valuable loot wins!

Clank! is a VERY fun game, although there can be concerns of replayability since there are only 2 different maps and the artifact locations on each do not change.  There is very little direct player interaction, but being able to manipulate the dragon into attacking when it is the most disadvantageous for your opponents can be quite satisfying.  There is a fair amount of luck in your deck draws, the cards that are available for purchase, and drawing from the clank bag.  Drawing clank can make for some very tense and exciting moments, and the ability to string together certain card combos is nice.  If you enjoy lighter deck builders and push-your-luck gameplay, I highly recommend this one.

Clank is a push-your-luck, ascension-style deckbuilding game where you have a few resources to manage: health, clank, money, attack, movement, and purchase power. Players will be traversing a point-to-point map using movement points from their deck. Moving from point-to-point may require a key or sword if you don't want to take damage. Along the way you'll come across merchants, randomized face-down tokens, and artifacts. Artifacts are the main purpose of the dungeon delving. If a player managers to get an artifact and get back out of the dungeon, they will receive bonus points and trigger the end game. The further you go in the dungeon, the more points the artifacts are worth, but if you don't make it above ground at the end of the game, you are eliminated. Player's purchasing cards from the central deck can trigger random attacks from the dragon. At which point all clank (cubes from all players in a pooled area) are added to a bag and a number of them are drawn and placed as damage. The frequency and severity of the attacks increase as the game continues and is at a fever pitch as people escape. I definitely see the appeal of this game and why it's popular, but I'm just not a huge fan of deckbuilding games. In addition, I'd much rather play Ra for push-your-luck, given the opportunity.

RATING: 9
This is every bit the silly random push your luck romp I'd hoped it'd be from watching playthroughs. I feel like deck building is my favourite mechanic but I'm loathe to commit because, lets face it, all deck builders are pretty much the same. Then this comes along with a whole new bunch of considerations. The tension at the end is strong, and players really can be hoisted by their own petard if they don't invest in movement to get around. 
Player elimination triggers an end game so is actually quite fun. Stories emerge. But nothing is too serious or tense - you could play this without thinking and still have a brilliant time, or you could play tactically or strategically. Only downside really is that I want more.

Burgle your way to adventure in the deck-building board game Clank! Sneak into an angry dragon's mountain lair to steal precious artifacts. Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow.

Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!

Clank! on the surface plays like any deckbuilder, however the addition of the map and the movement resource add a great new dimension to the classic buy cards to earn points. Interesting that players can choose to try to rush in and out of the dungeon with lots of movement cards or prepare for the long haul with some defensive mechanisms and delve deeper into the lair for more valuable treasure. Can't wait for the expansion to drop for a new board to explore.

This is a really great game, and it could be even better if the cards were a little better.

On the positive side, the clank mechanism is brilliant and works very well for creating an atmosphere of risk taking. Certain cards – usually more powerful ones -- force you to add your cubes to the dragon bag. The dragon strikes by pulling cubes from the bag (seeded with neutral black cubes and player cubes). If your cubes are pulled from the bag, you take damage. It’s not hard to die by any means. 

So the longer you run around grabbing treasure and using powerful cards, the more likely it is that you’ll die a rich man/woman – albeit in the dungeon. Just getting out is worth 20VP so you’re heavily incentivized. The cards offered some nice synergies and different ways of building your deck. So far so good. 

The downside is that there’s an awful amount of luck that may override player decisions. In my game, I was the Start Player and got off to a fast start by grabbing early bonus chits. These bonuses helped me get deep into the dungeon fairly quickly and easily (while removing them from other players). When the dragon cubes came out, I was quite lucky and never more than half wounded. I had the luxury to stop off for some extra loot grabs even though two others had exited, still avoided any wounds, and also exited for the 20VP bonus. I won by 30 points and it all felt a little too easy. Perhaps it was beginner’s luck but I didn’t see what other players could do other than hope my cubes were pulled.

Pros 
+ Great Artwork, solid components, nice insert, and easy to read cards
+ Clank! Mechanic created a lot of tension especially w/ 2 players
+ Deck Building w/ an adventure thrown in... how can you go wrong!?
+ Renegade games app has a solo option thrown in
+ Many paths to victory

Cons
- Set-up takes a little while since there are many tokens
- Play time can go longer than 60+ depending on player strategies
- Cards could be slightly thicker
- Not quite enough trashing mechanisms

So happy I picked this up, an outstanding game!

[b]Sold 12/10/2017[/b] - Got rid of this after picking up Clank! In Space!.  I think this is actually the better game, with Space being both longer and more dominated by randomness, but thematically, the in-jokes and references in the space version are more appealing, so we're more likely to play that one.

Simple deckbuilding combined with a 'dungeon delve' board makes for a fairly interesting combo.

The deck building aspect is simple... really really simple and there is not much 'combo' that you can achieve and really not much to let you thin your deck and make your engine, however because of the board part of the game it doesn't actually feel like you HAVE to streamline your deck and build you engine and churn points like many other deck builders do.Here you can have a sub-optimal deck and just enjoy the experience of the delve part.

The delve part is fairly fun with multiple paths you can follow and various treasures both face up and face down for you to acquire, but with every stolen treasure the dragon guarding it gets more and more pissed off.

The 'Clank' mechanic (noise your adventures make) is really interesting as it adds a new variable to try to mitigate, do you try to creep slowly and quietly round the dungeon, or do you stock up on healing items and stomp around in your heavy (noisy) plate armour.

Its a little off towards the end when players are no longer buying from the river of cards thus there is less dragon attacks, but a simple house rules could fix this thematic break

I'm curious if this game got the buzz it did because of all the fresh blood in the hobby who missed the first gen deckbuilder wave following Dominion's success. This particular game is a simplistic, multi-resource DBG with a more thematic take on the Cerberus system (CZE's mindless take on the genre). In practice, it's also a push your luck game. Had it come out seven years ago, it would have been awesome, but it just didn't grab me with all the other options out there these days.

2017-10-11: Very good deckbuilding with a board. I think I like this better than Trains since the deck doesn't balloon as much in this one. 
A bit scared of the 'race and get single treasure and rush out'-tactic, but I haven't met it yet. Also, Space-version remedies that.

Now played with sunken treasures which adds some things, but not that much. We played on the 'easy' side I guess since I had no trouble at all running down and getting the 30p treasure without getting hurt by water.

Initial rating: 8 (could be 9 but might grow stale? Or am I to harsh perhaps. . No. . with the quality issues of the Sunken-expansion at at least is at most an 8)

Slotted insert holds sleeved cards!  Thank goodness, another savvy publisher!  

Not sure why this is called Clank (didn't see the instructions). It is a dungeon, but no one in chains....yet, I guess if you make any noise (clanks) the dragon hears you???  Even though I love deck building games, this one looks bland to me...tiny cubes, a meeple, a board that doesn't grab my attention.  As the rules were explained, I thought this is just a copycat Ascension with so many similarities, and then I thought too, Adventurers Pyramid of Horus when players try to make it out of the pyramid, after finding hidden treasurers and backpacks to carry more.  And like Shogun, cubes go in, and blind, some come out to deliver damage.  Hmmm.  Boring.  Nothing new.  But.....I changed my mind!

Even though I found the "Clank" coming randomly out of the bag made the game quite unpredictable and difficult to follow a plan. & unfair!!!---it also made the game quite fun, especially when rooting for the demise of others!  

The outstanding board design with the movement thereon, is the gem and new element in this game.  The board offers many options with different avenues for movement, so even with a thwarted game plan(s), numerous other choices still make victory possible.  The board is 2-sided, offering variety.  Many cards have a unique concept... bonuses, but slapping you with the evil Clank as well.

Despite the fact I find the components lacking, and the game so reminiscent of other games, and planning so chaotic, I really like this game.  

My impression boils down to, it's fun.

Played  2 games now, and one objection to this game, not enough cards or ways to cull junk from hand.

Yes, yes, yes! I love everything about this game! It is super fun, super easy to introduce. I've introduced about 10 different people to this game and everybody except one was like "Wow, yay, can we play again?!". 

Nice dubble-sided board with lots of fun treasures. Cool cards with cool and balanced abilities. It is a really really well-balanced game that has a lot of replayability. BUY IT! Sooo much fun! Absolutely my current top 5 game of all time. 

The only downsides are, in my own opinion, the figures you move around with are meeples. Meh, boring. But I do understand that it would make the game much more expensive. My group uses minis from Descent instead ;) I would also point out the artwork.... I know a lot of people like it and it is absolutely NOT BAD, it's just a little simple in my mind. I think the castle at the top of the bord is kinda childrens book-like. 


All in all a super fun game! And I just bought the expansion

Tipikusan "ez hogy hogy nem jutott még másnak eszébe" játék. Alap mechanikákra épít, de sikerült ezeket teljesen egyedire összerakni. A hangulat maximális. Némileg megszállott deckbuilderesként viszont a döntést azért kevésnek éreztem. Nem lehet igazán ütős decket építeni, inkább csak a felhúzott kézből próbálod kihozni a maximumot az adott körben. Talán mintha kicsit kevés lett volna a szörny, nomeg  a shrinkelő lap. Nagyon jó bevezető játék lehet, ilyen szempontból kár hogy azért eléggé nyelvfüggő. Szóval szuper hangulatos, jó kis pakliépítés, könnyed esti mulatságnak.

Der Dungeon Crawler gehört zu den am meisten strapazierten Klischees je näher sich ein Spiel in Kampfrichtung Trash und Ameristrash bewegt. Parallel dazu wird es oft horrorfigürlich -  Miniaturen und Kampfsysteme ersetzen Strukturen. Manchmal verirren sich Dungeon und Fantasy in Eurogebiete wie im raffinierten DUNGEON PETZ oder wie in BLOOD RAGE. In KLONG wird der Dungeon von einem Drachen beherrscht, der den Raub von Artefakten durch uns Helden verhindern soll und durch die lauten Klongs aus dem Schlaf gerissen und alarmiert wird. Die Miniatur ist hier noch ein liebevoll geschnitzter Holzmeeple und die Schadensmarker sind Ressourcenwürfel euroklassicher Abstraktion. Daran lässt sich erkennen, das KLONG mehr sein will als sein Thema, auch wenn die Karten, die man sich in sein stetig breiter werdendes Deck sammelt, von Fantasyklischees nur so wimmeln wie ein Wimmelbild. Ja, auch Deckbau als Hipster-Mechanismus findet in KLONG seine Verwendung und macht es zu einem vergnüglichen Abenteuerspiel flacherer Einflugschneise ohne dabei an Varianz einzubüssen. Klingt widersprüchlich, ist aber schön. Diverse spielerische Wege führen durch das unterirdische Labyrinth im Erdreich unter dem natürlich dunklen Schloss. KLONG ist ein Konsensspiel, welches das spielende Gros gerne wieder mitspielt. Das Ganze in den Weltraum zu verschieben scheint mir übrigens eine sehr gute Idee zu sein, um aus Fantasy mehr Phantasie zu machen. KLONG IN SPACE darf angeflogen kommen. Vermutlich wie auch hoffentlich als Deutsche Adaption beim Schwerkraft Verlag, auch wenn der VK-Preis wie bei KLONG im Lachhaften bleiben wird. Trash as Trash can.

This is my favorite game. When I first saw it, I wasn't sure I would like it. The board looks a bit fiddly, and looks like a confusing maze. But the deck building mechanic and the games hype  was enough to give it a try! I'm so glad I did, because once you play you understand the board and it makes sense why it is laid out that way. It no longer bothers me. 
This games core is a deck builder that generates movement as a resource during your turn, in addition to money and things. With your movement you move around the board and are on an adventure. It has a ton of unique cards and high replayability. It also has a push your luck element where you can buy cardd that make noise (a bad thing) for sweet bonuses. It even comes with two distinct boards, one on each side. 
It plays well with two or four, but three is my favorite. 
I'm almost ready for the expansion and clank in space, but I'm still enjoying the original so much it will be a while until get them.
P.s. there are two cards called "tattle" in the market that make you add clank ("noise") on your opponets. We decided to throw these cards away, because we are all friends and the flavor was off with rattling each other out. Theives honor!

Dungeonquest with Ascension style deckbuilding.
The game falls into the same trap as Ascension and Star Realms, where you almost always want to buy the most expansive card, regardless of your strategy.
The random damage from the bag doesn't bother me much, but really frustrated some of my friends who played.

Update - It's better on repeated plays, though not sure a strategy of getting an artifact quickly and rushing out isn't overpowered and/or boring for the game.

I liked the mechanisms of Dominion but the theme and the overall gameplay was drab. Enter Clank! with its swanky new deck-building, dungeon-crawl hybrid system and I'm no longer underwhelmed by deck builders. Deck-building with a board, player interaction, no trains. It's great.

Super easy to teach and the game really explains itself with the theme. Run through the dungeon, collect loot, fight monsters, and avoid dying to the dragon. If you die in the depths, you lose.

Clank is a fun, engaging game!  It is a deck-builder, dungeon crawl which is light/medium weight and is done in an hour or so even with new players.  You cannot plan too far in advance since you don't yet know what will be available to pick up for your deck.  In between turns, you need to watch the strategies of the other players to make sure you have enough time to execute your plan, and also watch to see if "Nicki" wakes up to try to roast you!  

The instructions are straight forward and easy to follow, and can be covered in less than 10 minutes.  

I am very glad I bought this game, and would recommend it highly to regular and casual board gamers alike!

Great "deck-building with a board" game.  Like that the more powerful cards come out randomly and also cause the dragon to attack and other arrival effects.  This can also cause players to heavily use explorers and mercenaries if the cards that come out at first aren't very good though.

Having two different boards should keep exploration fresh for a while.

Overall a lighter and fun experience.

Really enjoyed! Played a two-player with partner and four-player with friends, both worked brilliantly. Was weird facing player elimination for the first time in years though! We don't yet really have a feel for the deck (and it does feel you don't get to run through it very many times in the game - maybe need more "trash" cards?), so I imagine we'll get more competitive, and the choices more tense, as we progress. Definitely going to play more.

This game came out of nowhere. It takes the best parts of Dominion, mixes it up in a scenario right out of Dungeon Quest, and turns it in to a pretty tight racing game with an awesome 'noisy armor attracts the dragon' risk reward system. The only real problem is that there needs to be new board layouts for variety. I could see some strategic routes being used over and over and it could eventually get stale. Granted, the board is double sided, but I'm sure more will be on the way. Great game.

The hype is strong with Clank! so I knew at some point or other I would give it a go. It was an enjoyable game, one that I could see myself playing a few more times, possibly more with new maps and cards to keep it fresh. The rules and mechanics are pretty straightforward, which is a big plus. I like the artwork as well - the cards have a typical DnD flavor while the board reminded me a bit of a Ryan Laukat game. Player action is on the minimal side but the race aspect heightens the tension so this isn't too much of a deal breaker. I was surprised that, for a deck-building game, there were no cards that allowed you to thin your deck.

Really didn't like this. The idea of a board with a deckbuilder is cool but I think I'd like the others better. This just felt too trite in terms of what the cards did, what they looked like, and of course the theme. So, even with a board, it felt too similar to all the other deckbuilders I've played that do everything else better. 


Edit: I found El Dorado to be better. It has more stress/competition among other players, utilizes the board in a better way despite being a simpler concept (race versus picking up treasure around a map), and had more interesting cards/deck design possibilities. It doesn't have the "push your luck" mechanic, but I didn't think Clank did that in a very interesting way. I prefer more straightforward and higher impact push your luck of Incan Gold, or Mystic Vale, another better deck builder.

edit from 8.5 to 9.5: after a great 2-player game, this game is a gem at 3 players! The deck building mechanic works perfectly with the board. Its a race for the treasures and a run for your life while the Dragon is more and more terrifying... My wife and daughter love the game!

I really enjoyed my first play of this game. A very interesting take on deck building. I like how you can win the game by A) getting big points via artifacts, B) getting small points via purchased cards and C) by being the first one out of the dungeon and trapping your opponents underground. Very cool! I would definitely play again. But this game was high on my wish list and after one play, I have no burning desire to go back. Am I getting burned out on deck builders? My #1 game of all time is a deck builder. That can't be it. Whatever it is, something is missing for me and while I will never turn down a play, this won't carve out a spot in my collection.

In this deckbuilder you have to deal with five different currencies: step, fight, recruit, money, health. This makes some  challenging decisions how to balance your deck.  The dragon attacks are for a great tension in this game. 
 Played it with a copy of a friend and compared to Vikings gone wild bought about the same time; this one is more fun.

Interesting twist dungeon crawler that uses deckbuilding mechanics. The twists are the map and the dragon which is the game clock. 

I would play again but not regularly, I feel the game may have a low replay value. Fortunately two maps: and easier and a harder version will give this longevity.

Feels a lot more like a race than a dungeon crawl. I do really like deckbuilders and so that's a plus in my books. The bag drawing isn't my favourite but it feels pretty hard to actually get eliminated (before the final attacks at least). Played this with my young cousins: they understood quickly and enjoyed it.

It definitely feels like if someone is just rushing in and out that it's very difficult to do anything other than race. Almost like a Mottainai pace where you want to get ahead and then end the game as fast as possible. I think I'll lean towards pure-deckbuilders instead as that's the part that I like most about Clank.

RATING: 9
A fun deck-builder of dungeon-delving for treasure. The deck-building is important but it doesn't feel like other deck-builders because you are more focused on trying to get through the dungeon on the board and grab the treasures you want before escaping. Lots of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The thing I love most of this game is the race aspect of it.  The suspense when someone grabs the lowest treasure and then tries to run out the castle leaves everyone on a kind of timer and forces their hand, which makes for a really neat ebb and flow as you don't want to go too far unless everyone is coming with you.

RATING: 6
Clank is a fun deckbuilder that also uses a board. Deckbuilding is looser than other games, but adding the board gives it more. As something more tangible to build towards, collecting goods in the depths is a nice push your luck element that gives more meaning to the cards. Clank is a great "heavy filler" style of games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Clank really shows off where a deck builder game can go. 3 parts deck builder and 1 part board game, Clank creates a compelling combination. The cards are wonderful with very few cards having multiple copies (beyond the starter decks) so most purchases feel special. Really love this game.

A nice improvement from Ascension, adding a board makes it a little more interesting.
It feels a little short though, and even more important with good cards in the beginning, if you get the card where you can teleport early on it not that bad :-)

RATING: 8
Although I'm not a huge fan of deck-builders, I believe this will supplant Dominion as my favorite in the genre.  Even though it is very luck dependant, I love the dungeon delving aspect of the game.

It's in the style of Ascension with a random market of 6 cards available at any one time instead of all cards being available at the same time (like in Dominion).  I like that this makes setup and cleanup easier, but it becomes more tactical since often times the card that you want to buy is no longer there when it's your turn. 

Sometimes you just get lucky and the right card at the right time shows up in the market. Like when you teleport into a locked room (with no key) to snag the high point artifact before you opponent can, and now you're stuck until your teleport card comes back around.  Oh look that Teleporter device just showed up in market right before my turn - neato!

Situations like that is what makes me love this game.  The dungeon delving along with deck building really hits on all cylinders for me.  True, sometimes you go on a long streak of bad luck and there's nothing you can do, but it is still a blast to play.

Surprisingly enjoyable deck building game.  Am not really an adventure game player, but can be tempted now and again, especially with a low play time of about 60 minute.

Good production value.  Some folks have reported issues with missing components, but their customer service appears to be great (had the components for the yellow player.. twice.  Wrote to them and got a response with a few hours!).

Although you choose which card(s) to purchase and where to move, it may be a tad random, as it really depends on the cards which are available for purchase, and how the player(s) before you play, and what they buy (if anything).

Starting last is a big disadvantage, in that you really need to go in deep to get a useful artifact, and changes are players who played before you got there first, so you end up with the left overs.  When you are last, a strategy is to purchase movement cards, if the darn things are available for purchase!  :)

Reduced from an 8 to a 7 after another game where I started last and had a hard time picking up movement cards...  Ended up with a 5 point artifact and was behind the winner by 35+ points even though I was able to get out and get the +20...  When you are last, too many things need to go your way...

I can't get enough Clank! I helped demo it at GenCon 2016 and PAX West 2016. Even after teaching the game all day every day for two cons, I still want to play it. This game does so many things right, but the important part is this: it's fun. Pushing your luck and grabbing as much treasure is a blast. My favorite part comes from the dynamic at the table when players start goading each other into making riskier plays or cheering for the dragon to attack another player. Highly recommended. Very easy to learn and to teach!

Clank! is a fast-moving deck-building dungeon-crawler, which pits players against the Dungeon, and paces them with a vengeful Dragon who lashes out at those stealing the treasure.
Basically, the game is DungeonQuest, or even Dungeon- but the map is far more fixed, and the penalties both more abstract, and more immediate- and much more forgiving.
Players start from a common portal into the Dungeon, and do not fight each other or help each other, except that they race towards he same treasures and secret tiles, trying to amass more than other players and still make it out alive and conscious.
There are no specialized player races or classes- so all players have the same total damage, and the same base card set.
Players hands generate three important values each turn: Movement, Combat, and Skills (money to buy cards to add to player decks) and may accumulate one penalty value, Clank!
Clank! is the innovation- collecting treasure (and victory points) or other noisy actions increase Clank!, measured in player color cubes.
Somewhat like the stacked deck in Pandemic, cards in the Dungeon deck may trigger a backlash (Dragon attack) on players- and the blind draw of Clank! cubes from a common bag allots the Dragon's retribution- and the cubes drawn become player injuries.
There is no set length of game, last player leaving the dungeon or being rendered unconscious by the increasingly irate Dragon triggers a count of Points collected- assuming the players made it either out of the dungeon entirely, or close enough the players can be saved to count their points.
The first player to leave the dungeon sets off a damage clock, forcing the game end within a few turns- this keeps things moving, and the game is generally light and enjoyable for all.

Need to play more to ascertain the following:
I feel like the game is goingto be a bit repetitive because there's no real board variety (sory,2 sidesisgood, but not thaaat variable) and I fear strategies don't all have the same merits (to be checked, our first play really gave lowest score to the "fast exiting" explorer, while the "go deepest & get loot & get barely out" strategy really kicked far ahead in points.)

Very interesting/different take on deck-builder. 

From friends that have played this a LOT, it seems that escaping first is actually a big gamble not in your favor. As the other players get 3 more turns before the game ends, they can spend those turns potentially buying more points/collecting stuff/etc. Also just heading towards the entrance generally signals to everyone else what your plans are (so they have more than 3 turns to prepare for the end). Also the cards that show up in the shop display can make a big difference if you get a few lucky purchases.

This is a game that is definitely played more for the fun of exploring, not for winning against other players due to skill. I don't think I would actually recommend this, but if it were on the table, I would play again.

Deck building with a dungeon theme! There are some neat ideas here, like the press your luck think about figuring out when to come out, and the idea of noise, but the game just didn't work well for me.  I think this is partly because it's kind of an obstacle course in ways I didn't really find interesting. (1 play)

Great game. Horribly written rulebook. The dragon attacks are not clear at all. It was only because there are cards that tell you to put dragon cubes back into the back that we realized that they should have been kept out when drawn. The companion app is very fun but once again isn't intuitive and requires some googling. This lack of clarity made the game slightly less fun during our first playthrough.

This completely changed my perception of deck building. Previously I had played Trains, found it very dry and wasn't really interested in what the other players were doing. In Clank! the theme works really well and I was completely immersed in it. Also everybody is invested when a Dragon attacks which builds tension. Thoroughly enjoyed this game.

Later I learned that I could have taken damage to move past the goblins in the dungeon, but not knowing that I was stranded and lost.  Nick won his first round game with 97 points and then won the entire tournament by scoring 116 in the final round!

A great job of working a map into a deck-building game.

The game presents interesting choices, is _very_ thematic, easy to teach and above all is... fun.
It has potential to hit the table easily and often.

FANTASTIC replayability.  Only a portion of dungeon cards come into play each time.  And _when_ they come is critical for their usefulness.  Thus different cards/their combinations are in the spotlight each time.

This is only the second deck-builder to enter my collection (after Ascension).  The other ones failed to excite me [shrug].

--

I wonder if almost non-existent mechanics of trashing cards out of the game here is a conscious designer's choice or a blatant omission...  Maybe some of it is planned for an expansion :>

EDIT: 4-player mode is weak. The game is watered-down, there is no _real_ race, no _real_ tension, precise and on-the-edge planning is non-existent. The interaction is random.
I won’t be repeating this mode.

This game remind me so much of the old console game Lode Runner. Run into the dungeon as fast as possible to get a few treasures before time runs out or getting killed. The deck building is simple yet very fun. The only reason I didn't rate it higher was because I felt players who exit the dungeon early are severely disadvantaged in the game. It just wasn't a viable strategy at all since it give everyone else 5 free rounds to do whatever they wanted and usually to pick up more treasures.

I liked this enough. It's in the Ascension vein of deckbuilders with an offer and multiple currencies, one for buying new cards, one for fighting monsters, and this one adds a map and a third currency to move around the map. I think the map adds something nice that Ascension needed. And the map actually does something and feels necessary, unlike in say Trains. The card effects are mostly fairly generic but with the map there is opportunity to make a few interesting unique effects. And there's a lot to do all throughout the cave, but there's also an incentive to get out quickly. But That's my main problem with the game, the push your luck stay in the cave aspect. It seems like for something this uncontrollable that can have this big of an impact on the outcome that makes the game feel somewhat meaningless.

Some aspects of it are quite novel, I like the pulling cubes from the bag.
But in all the game takes too long, and there is too much downtime between turns. It feels like the game needed more development to streamline some of the clunky bits, (the keys, the shop). The best tactic does seem to grab something and run.
On a 4 player game. It's hard to plan your turn before your go, as the shop keeps changing.
I'd rather play Dominion, Trains or Valley of the Kings, which I think are all better games.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (March 2017)

Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure can be a good deckbuilding game. It was much better than expected, but still it isn’t a game for me.

The rules are easy to teach. You can do it under 18 minutes. Playtime is around 90-110 minutes.

The art of the game is pretty good. The game´s components are very well done as well. The game board is prone to break. In the copy I played it was partially loose.

The idea of the game and the theme are pretty neat. You are exploring a dungeon looking for treasure while the dragon tries to kill you. The more noise you do in search of treasure, the more likely the dragon will hit you.

As most deckbuilding games, it has a high replayability factor. You don’t see all the cards in one play and the board is double sided. Also there is one expansion already out.

Clank! features a variable market offering (like Ascension, Legendary and Star Realms) and that’s a big issue for me. The luck of the draw is amplified by this and it is very unfair when a player can buy a great card in his turn and another can’t just because that card isn’t available anymore. I always prefer more fair deckbuilding games with an static market offering (Dominion, Penny Arcade, Tanto Quore). I really hate when luck alone decides what player can buy, that is, Clank is much more tactical than strategic. 

Due to the variable market offering, the game has a high luck factor and if you add the random distribution of the noise cubes (in our game the dragon hit the most the player who had the least cubes in the bag), you get an uncontrollable luck factor and that’s the main reason I sold the game, it is unfair and I cannot stand this kind of deckbuilding game.

The bonus tokens add another layer of uncontrollable luck and it seems they are very situational, sometimes they are very powerful, other times very weak. To summarize, the luck factor is very high and uncontrollable. 

The game decisions aren’t not that interesting, but, thanks to the map, they aren’t that obvious either. The map allows you to strategize a bit and plan ahead. It has some element of push your luck seeing how long can you remain in the dungeon.

Best with 3 fast players, with more, the downtime is excessive for such a simple game.

Another issue I have with the game, when a player exits the dungeon, the game continues for four whole turns, every other player can play four additional turns and that’s way too much of an advantage, even if someone dies in the upper part of the dungeon. I feel this part is unbalanced, you can do much more than 20 points in 4 turns.

Bottom line, Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure can be a good deckbuilding game for some players, but not for me, it is very unfair and luck plays a prominent role. It is a, mainly, tactical endeavor and you have to react most of the time. The planning you can do is very restricted and due to this I vastly prefer to play Dominion (a game in which I can plan all my game from the very beginning). Perhaps it is the best deckbuilding game that features a variable market offering out there, but still it isn’t enough for me to keep it. I already sold my copy of the game. I would play again if requested but if I don’t play it again I won’t be sad. The game´s idea is pretty neat though but its execution is disappointing for me.

Clank! is an enjoyable medium-light weight game. It is a deck builder with a board that is easy to pick up and play and quite fun. The game has some press your luck style of mechanics as well. In particular the press your luck mechanic comes into play with how much clank you produce (i.e., who is the dragon hearing the most) and, near the end of the game, how long you stay in the depths versus getting above ground.

Great little deck-builder with a board. The game is on the lighter, family weight side, but offers a fun traipse through a perilous dungeon. It offers a fun combination of deck-building and press your luck.

The game is just pure fun. The push-your-luck aspect with going deeper and potentially incurring the wrath of the dragon is all the best parts of DungeonQuest with none of the questionable strategies that DQ allows. The cards are well-differentiated and amusingly themed. If I were to criticize anything, it would be that the static board may limit replayability a bit, but it is two-sided and I can only assume that expansion boards will continue to be produced. I might end up keeping this one as long as I've kept DQ, which is going on 30+ years now!

RATING: 6
At first it was fun, but from the middle game our decks were so fat that all of us had to spend useless turns. There are extremely few ways to remove the initial weak cards, this is why I don't think it works as a deck-building game. Additionally, randomness at picking tiles is determinative. I think this game is a good idea that needs more development.

RATING: 10
Great fun that will likely have broad appeal.  Clank! can serve as an excellent introduction to deck building that young players and neophytes will appreciate. Double-sided board (one side more complex than the other) adds to replay value.

One year later: Every group to whom I have introduced this game has loved it. Kids, teens and/or adults. Still fun after dozens of plays.

A friend of mine picked up one of the limited copies at GenCon 2016.  We've played it at almost every gaming gathering since.  
It has a perfect balance between Deck Building and Dungeon Exploring adventure, with a press-your-luck element to avoid the dragon attacks while trying to get out of the dungeon with your stolen loot.  
2-4 players.  A reversible board for different difficulties. All of the pieces are very high quality. We sleeved the 180+ cards that come with the game. 
I can't imagine getting tired of this game any time soon.

I love deck builders and the goals and options this game adds are fantastic. The solo mode and additional challenges Renegade has put out in their companion app along with the additional boards has pushed this into one of my all time favorite games. Yes, it has the typical marketplace problem and, yes, it may not be the greatest deck builder ever created, but the theme and concept are so rich and easy to comprehend that everyone I've showed the game to has loved it, understood their goals, and wanted to play again. A must play.

Love deck-builders, this one might be my favourite of the few I've played. Even though the deck-building aspect is not as strong due to fewer culling abilities, this is balanced by the fact that most cards you purchase will feel impactful when you use them. The race aspect is a fun bit of take-that and push your luck, which never feels too mean because there are always other options. There's a great sense of adventure, while still emphasizing the importance of efficiency, that makes this game special for me.

Neat idea, and doesn't overstay its welcome - with the caveat that at least one of the players is trying to make sure that people aren't overstaying their welcome; the game can bog down significantly if players become too involved in plumbing the depths of the dungeon. When played at a brisk pace though, it becomes a tighter affair as you race to get the best treasure you can before turning around and hauling yourself back out before time runs out. It then becomes a risk/reward situation where delaying escape for a round or two can outweigh the bonus at the dungeon's exit. The addition of the push-your-luck element helps raise Clank! beyond its deckbuilding peers; you're still at the mercy of what random five cards you'll have on your turn. But you've got the option to focus on those dangerous/powerful/valuable cards to strike quickly and get back out of the dungeon as fast as possible.

Whimsical and entertaining.  The addition of a map (and with it, terrain and location) puts it head and shoulders above similar deckbuilders for me.

Tested both sides of the map. "Hard" version took us by surprise. This game teaches how to push your luck and do risky business. Great Deck Building that evolves through the game... you will find your first rounds limited, but if you acquire and play your cards correctly, you will see a growing effectiveness on your deck, saw a player play his deck magnificently on the last round, was able to pick quite some loot and get out of the depths... good times. I lost both games... killed by the dragon (not on the deeper part of the dungeon, mind you) but I was able to take other players with me on the same dragon attack. Randomness on the cubes selected from the "dragon" bag adds some suspense that is thrilling and cool. Enjoyed this game!

This sooo fires Dungeon! and a few other crawlers out there. It almost fires Dominion and some other deck-builders out there too. Have played 2 2-player games and had a blast. Scored 103 pts the first time and a miserable 61 pts the second. Had a great time both games. It starts slow and just speeds up from there. The deck building aspect is very clever and the display has cards that affect the game while they remain in the display. So you want to get rid of them asap if you can. There are instants in the display too, as well as cards that you can buy and add to your deck. The artwork is fabulous and the board outstanding; double-sided for easier and harder. 
It's great to start combo-ing your hand of cards together. Sometimes starting with 5 and building up to 8 or 10 cards even. Brilliant variety of cards to keep the game interesting. Lots of D&D-style cards to choose from - Elven Cloak, Teleporter, Wands, Boots of Swiftness, Pickaxe, Gems, Dragons Eye, etc, etc. It's great fun checking out all the different stuff you can buy.
Your deck can 'stall' at times if you don't have enough boot symbols on your cards; no boots, no movement. I died in the second game near the dungeon entrance as I drew 3 hands with only 1 boot of movement.
Awesome fun! A must buy. This should charge into the Top 20 if not the Top 10.

Haven't played for a few months (other games - you know how it is) but thoroughly enjoyed a game last night. Awesome fun still. I really don't see the need for an expansion. There's so many cards already and two maps is plenty. Highly recommend this game.

By adding a board to Ascension they have been able to make buying aggro viable. At the same time the board is however adding to the luck of the draw heavily. Like Ascension, this one is probably at its best with two players with less downtime and less market lottery. Art is kinda nice with some cultural references hidden in there. The bananas should start deeper.

Wow, just wow. What a beautiful concept. I didn't really dig Ascension but seeing a similar mechanic such as monsters and stuff in such a cool package really brought me in. There is something physical about using a board to move and race with others. Getting points in other deckbuilders seem artificial while on this you really feel like you stole something valuable and you feel good about yourself. I have never played a game that didn't end with someone just 1-2 steps away from escaping died since they didn't draw the move they needed. I love this game. A new favorite of ours. I recommend it to everyone. You might just avoid playing it with 4 since it creates a bit downtime.

I won't say this is my favorite deck builder but it might be the one I have the most fun playing. I'm still coming to grips with exactly what that means.

I like that's it's competitive without being too cutthroat. It's possible to adversely affect your opponent by trying to incite dragon attacks or by snatching loot out from under their noses but it all seems really good-natured.

I like that there are different ways to build out your deck and so there are a number of ways to win.

It's fun to try to decide if you want to push your luck to go a little deeper or stay in the dungeon a little longer. It's very satisfying to count your loot at the end.

I've played solo a couple of times with the app. It's okay but I vastly prefer playing with other folks and there are other games I would prefer to solo.

All in all, I'd say this one was a winner and I'd happily play anytime.

I'm mostly burnt out on deck builders. Most of them seem to be basically the same game. I like clank because it adds more than just buying the cards and playing a game of who has the best 'engine'. 
The movement around the board adds more decisions to make than just 'what should I buy this turn', but doesnt add too much to be overwhelming for players new to the genre of deck building.

The dragon mechanic of drawing random cubes of who gets attacked is also a new twist on similar random damaging type of mechanics.
Again, this adds more decisions for the players of trying to self manage the amount of 'clank' you are producing.

I love dominion and deck building game. I anticipated that this is the game that I will love before I have it, as it has an interesting theme and mix deck building with movement on the board, push your luck, etc. However after a few plays, it doesn't meet my expectation so far as the gameplay is a bit light, repetitive, deck building is just ok (not easy to get out some good combo) and not much strategy involved. Is not a bad game but it can be better. Love the concept and artwork though, and is suitable for non-gamers. Set up does take some time.

RATING: 8.5
I am not going to describe how the game works, and I wont be explaining what I like about it either, you can find that on any other 5 starts review, I will only be listing the possible problems you might find in this game, and like I said, it is a fantastic game and it desires 9/10 IMO.

- Being e first to leave the dungeon is never in your favor, the 3 turns you miss effects you very badly, if others weren't really that far behind they will have 3 turns to catch up and leave the dungeon safely, unless they were too greedy but then it would be their own option to drop the advantage they got. In most of the games I played though the first person to leave was knocked out, so this is not a big problem, but it makes leaving on your own less of an option.

- Creating combos in Clank is very hard, if you wanted to combo +Clanks with -Clanks you will have to invest in too many "card drawing" cards and you will need more -Clanks than +, otherwise you might end up in terribly bad situations, and investing that much in one combo is not effective, so eventually it might be better for you completely forget about combos and just avoid card with so many +Clanks.

- Because combos are not that effective, focusing on a certain strategy with card purchasing isn't very impactful, you can randomly buy any card you like and you might still end up with the best score without any strategy.

- It isn't easy to guess where you stand in Clank, deciding wither you should dive deeper or just leave because you are on top is very hard, this is an extra random factor that I don't like.

Fantastic game, hybrid dungeon crawler/ deck builder.  8 y/o had a blast and so did I.  Will definitely bring out for monthly lunchtime games at work, and maybe even game groups depending on the mix.

Update - fun almost every time i play, lots of tension later in the game.  Upping to a 10.

►Sunken Treasures

Went into this thinking of the game as a deckbuilder with an interesting spatial twist.
Although the real twist was... there is not much deckbuilding here - most cards don't really interact with each other.
It is clear that luck plays a dominant part, and my view shifted somehow - I now treat this more as a party game at heart with a whiff of decision making along the way.

Deck building smashed up with a dungeon crawl board game.  Cards enable you to move, fight and/or provide skill points that you use to buy more cards.  Some cards are noisy maneuvers (Clanks) that increase your odds of having the dragon injure you when the thing gets angry enough.  Fun, light, plays quickly and a nice combination of mechanics that I enjoy.

Very interesting twist on a traditional deckbuilder. While games that are purely deckbuilding may seem boring to some people, Clank! adds the mechanism of using deckbuilding to help you move through the dungeon more efficiently and grab better loot. some of the maps may be too confusing for some people, but overall, I feel like you could play this game  with a large variety of people

Clank! starts slow and picks up speed when the adventurers pick up their first treasure.

It is surprisingly light. The board is double sided something I failed to register from watching some gameplay.
The back of the board makes it tougher to get high scores, but it doesn't change the rules ... The dungeon is just more dangerous.

While Clank! didn't blow me away the hunting for treasures has a great push your luck element to it.

While or initial play was a bit long subsequent plays will trim a play down to 30-40 minites.
And if it continuously clocks in at 40 minutes it is one of those fillers that hits too many points I like to neglect.

Burgle your way to adventure in the deck-building board game Clank! Sneak into an angry dragon's mountain lair to steal precious artifacts. Delve deeper to find more valuable loot. Acquire cards for your deck and watch your thievish abilities grow.

Be quick and be quiet. One false step and CLANK! Each careless sound draws the attention of the dragon, and each artifact stolen increases its rage. You can enjoy your plunder only if you make it out of the depths alive!

Great fun, but the dragon attacks can be very random. There can be one every turn or spans of five or six turns without attacks. The damage tracks rarely reached past 4 damage, and everybody had time to heal. Otherwise, clever linking of known mechanisms and very easy to teach

A really nifty fantasy exploration & "dungeon" crawl deck-builder.  I like this much, much better than Thunderstone.  I particularly like the unnerving balance of Clank! bits awakening Dragon attacks and the options of either trying for exploring for treasure versus loading up your party with fighters to repel the monsters.  

Overall, I find this a fantastic game system that invites so much variety and different boards to explore (akin to Age of Steam, etc).

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is quite an enjoyable adaptation of the Ascension style deckbuilding game with a game board in which your adventurer goes exploring/fighting. One needs to watch out in making noise and garnering the attention of the dragon who can kill you before you get above ground. It is a bit of a race, push your luck adventure and plays fairly quickly. I found it quite enjoyable.

"what sets this deckbuilder in a distinct class is the valuation of those cards. You see: you need all types of cards (nothing new there - that's just good tension in design), but the value of a card in the display I believe *changes* as play unfolds. What I need early in the game isn't what I really need later. Movement is always grand, but I really *do* need gold about midway through to obtain some room to hold another artifact or get the limited number of keys to allow efficient travel. Not to mention swords to help stop my own health from deteriorating. 

And I should say here that the race feeling is very real. The first player to 'die' (yes, you can be eliminated in this game) sets the end game in motion - only 4 more rounds and all is at an end. What's worse, however, is in those 4 final rounds, you will most certainly be at risk of dying yourself. Here is where the title drop lands: certain cards generate (as a penalty) 'clank' - represented by your colored cubes placed aside (for the moment) in a display on the board. When the dragon is riled up (determined randomly by the conveyor belt of cards), those cubes are tossed into a bag and a few are drawn back out randomly. Each cube of your color is a single hit on your health. If your health fills up, you are out of the game. If this happens while you are too deep into dungeoneering, you are out of the game - and lose as well (you are not even given the opportunity to score). Perhaps this is too brutal for some to stomach - but then again, such types would avoid DungeonQuest as well."

* Notes
+ What you need varies during the course of the game. Of course I will prefer the variety of the things you need in Race during a game. Maybe also I don't need this, as Puzzle Strike has this in part (need money sometimes, need crashes/combines later).
+ Fun to risk dying.
$ I don't like the conveyor belt mechanism?
+ Nice tension 
- Quite light

What's Great:
This game is very easy to pick up, but has varying strategies to extend its longevity. Adding a board to deckbuilding was truly innovative, it feels more substantial than with just cards. Short runtime allows for multiple playthroughs (and you'll definitely want to!).

What's Not So Great:
Certain players can shorten the game considerably by grabbing a quick artifact and leaving the dungeon immediately (can be remedied by house rules). The thrill of the game comes from the anticipation of new cards to purchase. Once you've seen all of the cards a few times, the thrill is gone, but strategies start to kick in at that point. 

Verdict:
One of the best (hybrid) deckbuilding games that allow both casual and competitive gamers to get into with a reasonable runtime. With the new expansion out, you'll have the option of more variety and replayability. 

We use a blind artifact house rule where all artifacts are random and face down until you pick it up. Sometimes we play a two artifact requirement variant (and the bag is just victory points) which allows for more extended play.

This game is extremely reminiscent of Dungeon Quest. It's a question of how long you'll tour the dungeon before you get out.

I like that this game is less risky, and furthermore that the first person out triggers the countdown to the end game. It's also nice that even if you don't escape there's a way to still make it out, and likely, be a contender for the win.

There should be more games that use deck building in this way.

So much fun to play. Tense, exciting, great art, clever cards. Love the clank cubes in a bag mechanic. I wish there were more opportunities to trash cards; ending up with a "starter" hand near the end of the game is a real bummer. Being able to dump a couple more of those as the game proceeds would be nice. Minor quibble, though. This game is stupendous fun.

I really enjoyed the theme and mechanics of the clank system. It was very intuitive, and themed appropriate. I also really enjoyed the mechanic of battling monsters. I thought it was done super well and added another element to your deck building. 

I highly recommend this game. This game is great for new gamers and experienced gamers alike. If you like deck building and press your luck mechanics, you should definitely get this game.

Tactical deck builder with a bit of racing and push your luck.  Even though those mechanisms can be found in tons of games, it is all combined in a way that makes the game feel unique.

Can have a bit of an adrenaline rush towards the end of the game since you'll either be racing to get out of "The Depths" or hoping you survive the dragon's attacks.  

My "deck building + map" rankings: Tyrants of the Underdark > Clank! > Trains


After 5 plays, I've had enough.  Not a game I need to own.  The deck building and map play of Tyrants of the Underdark is more interesting so I'd always pick it to play over Clank.  More tension in Tyrants, as well, since you're actively trying to maintain/take control of different areas of the map.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very nice combination of deck building and dungeon crawling, Clank! melds these two genres seamlessly. The different options on the cards allows for diverse strategies and the push-your-luck decisions are fun. You can teach this game in under 10 minutes and it moves quickly between turns, making it suitable for a wide range of player ages and experience.

I wish there were more cards to cull your deck as it gets quite bloated by the end of the game. It would also be nice to see characters with different starting decks. Expansion maybe?

The free app is a HUGE bonus, allowing for solo play and increased difficulty in multi-player.

I didn't think I'd like the push-your-luck aspect because I generally dislike that, but the players control the timer in this game to some extent. I also like the balance of all the different ways to get points. The artifacts are important, but you can grab a small artifact, and if you leverage the other ways of getting points, you can still win.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad game, but I don't consider it to be the new standard of deckbuilding.

Much like Trains, Clank tries to merge having a board with the aspects of deck building.  Whereas Trains tries to be like Dominion with fixed stacks, Clank tries to be like Ascension with a random market line from a single deck.

Very similar to Ascension, the higher cost cards do far better than lower cost cards, and you play everything in your hand.  However, with the numerous currencies that players have to deal with (Skill, Movement, Gold, and Attack), it does make the turns a little more involved over other Ascension style games like the Legendary series.

My big issue with the game is the board barely plays a role and the balance is out of whack.  In my game, I grabbed the second highest artifact and a few treasures, was first to make it out, and still lost by half.

The player who won didn't even have an Artifact and simply stacked Ancient Tomes (victory cards similar to Dominion), gold, and had a Wizard to boost his victory points from the Ancient Tomes.  He barely played the board and won by nearly double the point.  He didn't even get the bonus for leaving since he was knocked out in the castle

Because of this, I can't see myself playing the game often enough to warrant a purchase.  Much like Trains, Clank suffers an issue where players can simply stack victory point cards to win the game without doing much on the board.  Maybe an expansion will fix it, which is a shame because they definitely have a great system at work here.

Splendid! First play with two was smooth and pleasant; never stressful, but every decision was interesting. The bits and presentation are flawless, from the quality of the components to the clear and useful design and iconography.

I could tell after reading the rules that it was lighter than it would look on the table, and teaching it with that in mind worked well. It's simple to teach and fun to play, and everything in the fiction of the game flows well from its mechanics -- and vice versa.

It feels like a mashup of Dungeon! (or maybe DungeonQuest) and Thunderstone/Ascension, but it has a whimsical vibe all its own. I dig it.

Simply a blast to play!

Combines:

-Push-your-luck

-A tad bit of "take-that", when you steal an artifact in front of another player.

Absolutely recommended - a game that is a lot of fun, whether you win or lose.
I've explained the rules to 7 people, and a few of them though that there were "information overflow". There a lot of little rules, but the core gameplay is quite simple (though strategic, with a ton of different tactics to use).

One of those game where you just grab a beer, relax and have a good and fun time with your friends.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Was so excited when I went to play this, but ended up so disappointed with the actual play. Issues:

1) Just too luck-based. e.g. person with fewest clank could still have most damage (by a factor of two!), and person with most clank in bag could not be damaged at all for first half of game (and never have to worry about it all game). This is the central mechanism of the game, so I was disappointed how pointless it was to try and modify clank when luck overrode all efforts here.
[Untested idea for how it could be made less random: whoever has most clank outside bag takes one guaranteed damage before cubes are put in bag (multiple people get 1 damage if tied at >1 clank outside); any remaining damage/draws are dealt randomly.]

2) Really really too luck-based: cards that are bought on the turn they appear was a real issue. Some cards are super-valuable and priced cheaply. Some cards clearly dominated others (e.g. better abilities and cheaper). This was an obvious balance issue; before the game the winner had told us to look out for 3-4 valuable cards, and almost all of them appeared on that one person's turn. Indeed, our final rankings were perfectly ordered by how many of these cards we got.
[Untested idea: Other players given option to outbid for just-revealed cards, or some other balancing mechanism to ensure price is somewhat proportionate to value.]

3) Runaway leader: Once you have a great deck (thanks to #2 above), you'll continue to build a better deck since you have more actions and skills every round. It was dead obvious who was going to win about 30 minutes in (they had more VPs, better mobility, and double actions per turn; the gap would increase by about 5 VPs each round!), and having to keep playing when you know the result is not at all fun. Especially when their lead felt more given to them (by #1 and #2) than by superior play.

No player interaction, push your luck, not my favorite combo.  Not too bad though, pretty simple and easy to play.  Kind of sucks you can't do anything once you get out of the dungeon except hope everyone dies.

RATING: 6
This rating is based on only one play, something I try to avoid, but because this game does something I dislike in the extreme, I think it valid. 

I don't like deckbuilders in general, and specifically not of the Ascension variety. However, Clank manages to be fairly entertaining. I found the theme strong, and the mechanisms sound. 

Where Clank went off the rails for me was in two spots. One, it has player elimination. Two, the end game is just terrible, as the first player to leave the dungeon is out of the game, watching other players take turns. To me, that is a poor excuse for game design in what is otherwise a fairly engaging experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really want to love Clank! but I find myself hesitant to give it a full endorsement.  First, the dragon mechanic in the game is too simple with 2-3 players.  The only time I feel any tension with the dragon is when we play 4 player.  Otherwise it feels like you can stay in the dungeon as long as you want and there is no real threat of a fiery death.  

Second, I wish the strategy was better.  My play group sort of discovered early that most games can be won by simply rushing to the earliest treasure, and then rushing out of the dungeon as fast as possible.  Everyone else is left to fight over the remaining items, and hope they can get out in time before they instantly die.  Once in a while someone does, but it's kinda rare.  

Finally, I find the deck building to be very uninspired.  To be honest, I've won several games by simply drafting only Explore cards with a couple other minor fillers.  It just feels like most of the cards are completely unnecessary and actually slow you down instead of help you.  

I would be interested in other people's opinions on these 3 points, because it seems that a lot of people really love this game.

RATING: 9
This is a really interesting combination of a classic deck builder with a hint of dungeon crawl mixed in. Utilising the the typical 'River' setup you use your cards to explore the dungeon and attempt to be the first to escape with the biggest haul of treasure, all the while trying not to anger the resident dragon. The titular Clank mechanic really adds a nice rules twist to think about.

RATING: 7
Fast, fun, and fresh deck builder on a map. Picture a mashup of Dominion, Trains, and Orleans and that's what you have here. 

Timing when to head back to the top of the map is an interesting decision. It will depend on what your opponents are doing and your health meter. I like that you can win without returning home as long as you have an artifact and aren't underground when you run out of time.

I'd like to see more variability in the initial map setup as well as all of the question mark tiles face up, so you can strategically choose a path in advance. I realize the six cards available for purchase contributes to this decision but having more information available would be even better.

Takes the basic deck building mechanic from Ascension or Star Realms and takes it to the next level. I really like the challenge of building your deck to get proper resources while keeping you able to move through the dungeon. Mild push-your-luck element with how deep you want to go in the dungeon. I recommend sleeving this game, cards get marked easily. Solid, fun game.

This game reminds me of Dominion crossed with Thunderstone played on a board with fantasy-themed thingamadinkers. Okay, that description sounds nauseating, what with the mehness of Thunderstone and the boundless contempt I feel for Dominion.

But, surprisingly, I don't hate it. I wouldn't say I love it (Come on, now, I wouldn't lie to you.) But it is mildly amusing to play. And it has a card for a cat character named Mister Whiskers, which (obviously) makes it better.

I have it on good authority that you cannot win unless you buy Mister Whiskers. And by good authority I mean my own relatively prodigious and possibly unreliable imagination.

At least it sort of seems like you are buying cards for a reason. Unlike Dominion, that sucktastical sack of suck, oh how I hate thee.

A decent deck-builder that has you move around the map.
Not sure I like how much the game can be rushed.

I do like the systems though and I think it's likely fair enough. But it gets quite boring in a 4-player game if one player just grabs the first treasure and leaves.

The deck-building aspects never quite ramp up enough as you can do that in just a couple of turns.

Deck builders are my favorite genre of boardgames. Clank added a dungeon crawl aspect, loot collecting, and push you luck to deck building.  Games usually do not last more than an hour  and the scores are normally much closer than you think. The double-sided boards and abundance of cards really make the game have a lots of replayability. My only gripe at the game is the car seem a little too thin and the meeples and dragon meeple could have been a bit more thematic. I'm excited for the many expansions to come.

An interesting blend of deck building and play on the board.  The Clank! mechanic is interesting.  My initial concern is that the game is short and there's not many ways to remove cards from your deck, as a result most of the cards you add to your deck are only going to come up once or twice which isn't very satisfying.

RATING: 9
The combination of the ascension like deckbuilding with the board makes this truly an excellent game which is a lot if fun to play. Balancing the movement, swords and skills is the usual deckbuilding fun. Combining it with a treasure delving board with a race element is super fun. Everything from going after the loot, drawing the cubes from the bag when the dragon attacks and pushing your luck when you know you shouldn't makes this a truly rich deckbuilder. It is great with all player counts, looks great, not too long, great mechanics. I am loving this one. If you are a fan of ascension (like me) you will LOVE this. If you tend to like deckbuilder you eill definately like this game and have a ton of fun. Highly recommended!

RATING: 9.5
Very fun and gripping end game. Each way to score seems pretty balanced and it has a nail biting ending on whether you can make it out of the depths or even back out of the dungeon before being knocked out. The extra points you obtain from cards help keep the winner up in the air until the very end. Great use of the board with the cards. Seems to scale well from 2 to 4 players. Look forward to playing plenty more of this.

Great deckbuilder with a board with a push your luck mechanism attached to it. You need to run through a dungeon , picking up artifacts on the way, trying to make it safely back up out of the dungeon before the dragon gets mad. Really good and enjoyable to play! My 6-year old son would play this all day long and even though he doesn't know english, he knows what all cards do by memorizing them. Highly recommended family game! Just pure fun. I try to avoid it with 4 players though as it takes too long then for what it is imo - but 3 players rocks!

I had no expectations for Clank! but I had a lot of fun playing it.  While it is a deck builder with some novel twists, it reminded me a little of DungeonQuest where the goal is to enter a dungeon, steal the dragons loot, then get the hell out of there before you die.  It also had a Talisman-like ending where the first person to get out is having the dragon attack the other players instead of taking their normal turn (kind of like the Crown of Command attacks in Talisman).

RATING: 6
I really loved this game after my first play, but it very quickly becomes samey. You quickly realize that movement is of the utmost importance, but otherwise it becomes a game of grabbing as much as you can and being above ground before things get too tense. It plays best with 2 or 3, because at 4 you're almost guaranteed to clean the dungeon out pretty handily if everyone is pushing their luck. I do like that this game rewards those who try to stick it out for as long as possible, but I wish there was just a little more variety and uncertainty to your actions. As it is, I find the game entertaining, but not as deep as other, similar deck builders.

Prefer DungeonQuest for a similar theme.

This game may be the killer of several deck builders for me.  The additional of a spacial element to deck building on the game board really makes the mechanism pop for me.

Throw in the ability to finish a game in around an hour and you have a winner.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  I do like the theme of going into a dragon's den and stealing his treasure. I think it shows the theme rather well since you're trying to sneak around, but you're constantly making noise and the more treasures that are stolen the more the dragon is angered. 

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  This game, to generalize, is a long push your luck game. I actually like push your luck game quite a bit because of the excitement they can generate. I think that this mechanic works really well in this game because, not only do you have to make a decision on if you want to keep digging for better treasure, but you also have to determine how close you're willing to get to death. You can get cards that won't heal you, and you can ignore the small question mark tiles that may have a potion, but that may come back to bite you.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  Although the artwork isn't as good as some other card games that really put a lot into making their artwork thematic, I like the way the art in this game looks. The treasures are generally on pedestals. Each of the characters on the action cards are in the same area, which would usually be a flaw, but it almost makes this deck-builder feel a bit more like a video game.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  The game will probably last you about 45 minutes to an hour, which is the perfect length for this kind of game. Enough time to make the push your luck somewhat of a dedication and therefore more exciting, but not so long that the push your luck element could eliminate a player and have them sitting around twiddling their thumbs for a majority of the night.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] Some of the cards are really interesting, but I will admit they're very typical of this kind of game. I don't really know what actions these cards could've given that would subvert that "typical" feeling I get from them, but basically every card in this game is something that anybody could've easily come up with if they were to design this game. That isn't necessarily a huge flaw, because these cards still make for a fun game, but I never thought that any of them were incredibly unique or interesting.

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] Sometimes, just by luck of the draw, the dragon rarely ever attacks. If he's always attacking, I'm okay with that because it makes the game really intense. But when he never attacks, it makes the game kinda boring. Most deckbuilders I've played don't suffer from this same problem, since it's usually what the players play that makes the difference, but never drawing dragon cards is the kind of thing that's exclusive to this game.

[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR]       I think it's okay. Because of the push your luck enjoyment that this game can produce, I rate it higher than I otherwise would have, but there are certainly flaws to consider with this game.             [/i]

I would call Clank! an 'advanced filler'. Rules are not too complicated, decisions are often rather easy and there is not a huge amount of strategy to be aware of. It is very thematic and can be very tense with the increasing strength of the dragon attacks and the push-your-luck mechanism when one player makes a run for the exit. Still, luck plays quite a role: drawing good card combos from your deck, having good cards available to purchase, finding helpful treasures etc. In addition, downtime between turns can be quite significant when the other players take their time weighing their options as there is almost no player interaction. Hence, the sweet spot seems to be 3 players while 2 also works ok. Not so great with 4. Plus, turn order seems to be important with players moving first having an advantage. 
Overall, gameplay does not seem to be all that different from game to game which does not bode well for Clank's staying power.

Very good deckbuilding game mixed with dungeon dwelling and push your luck mechanics, that give a sense of threat as you go deeper into the dungeon to fetch the high points artefacts. A really nice spin on the deckbuilding genre. The app that allows you to play the game solo it's also a big plus.

Good game, but the winner (among relatively equally skilled players) can be pretty random. The cards are pretty unbalanced in my opinion, so what comes up (to buy) on your turn can have a large impact on how effective you can be. Similarly with how the Clank! draws come out. 

All that said, it is very fun and we have put in probably 10 games and still enjoy it.

This game is really fun.  First game I almost made it out of the dungeon but my 10th clank cube forced me to meet an untimely death, just inside the castle... I could see daylight!!!! Then it faded.......

My ONLY gripe is that the game continued for 20 more minutes and I got to sit and watch....

A really nice, simple dungeon crawl/deck builder with a large element of luck based on the cards you draw.

The inclusion of a reverse board and now the expansion add a little more depth (pun intended) to the game without changing the complexity too much.

This is a very fun deck builder with a board. I love the push your luck mechanic of staying down below just a little bit longer than you should. I can absolutely see this one in my collection eventually.

The base game is 70% of dominion with additional map/doungeon crawling, ability to travel/fight and collect some tresures/artefacts.

But the deck building part is almost the same like in Dominion - even some cards are very similar.

In addition, you have that Clank! feature which speed up the game by slowly killing players.

Good game.

This game really is a dungeon RUN. Delve deep, kill the monsters, grab the loot, dont't forget to stop by the shop and hurry out, causing a cave in burying the opponents. Its fast, requires fast descisions and some planning ahead (you dare not forget to buy boots). AND it is absolutely FUN (especially if Mr Whiskers causes the death of your last opponent by teasing the dragon to attack).

Have only had the chance to play once so far, but the game is very good at creating the atmosphere of exploring a dungeon for treasure. From picking up helpful equipment to avoiding trying avoid the attention of the dragon, the game felt like an adventure and not just a competition.

The actual game mechanics aren't my favorite for competing with other players, but part of that is my preference. There is depth and nuance to the options available to players that I know others will enjoy. 

The game is made with high quality components which is always nice.

Overall, I'm not going to become obsessed with the game, but it is very sold and well-rounded. I believe that I would almost always be up for playing it. I think it will appeal to a broad range of gamers, from those who appreciate atmosphere and exciting moments to those focused on measured strategical decisions, so it would be a good choice to bring to a board game night.

Fast playing, fairly light deck-builder -  you are not going to see very many complex decisions in terms of what cards to purchase for your deck or even what order to play your cards in, because it doesn't really matter for the most part.  And as if deck building itself wasn't random enough, Clank adds even more luck through random bonus tiles, random cube draws.

What saves this from being an utter piece of garbage and what makes it actually fun to play is that there is a physical board through which you move your character.  The game has a push your luck element which  adds to the excitement -   Do you spend the time to gather more points and treasure or is the Dragon nipping at your heels and about to kill you, so now it is time to flee?  

The game is light enough that younger gamers and casual gamers should be able to handle it.  It is a little too long to be considered a filler.

 I did not try it solitaire so I cannot say how well it plays with only one person.

Very good idea for deckbuilder. Felt a bit sour after 3rd game ended the same way as previous two - with one player grabing the first treasure and bolting out. Seemed like so much more potential just got not used. We played the smaller side of the dungeon and we're hoping that the bigger side fixed that problem a bit more.

Have now played ~4 times. I love this game! My only fear is that after playing several more times, that it won't be as replayable as I'd love without expansions to increase/change up the cards/loot and also perhaps a small board expansion (secret dungeon rooms, or something).

That said, I can't wait to play again. Still love all the mechanics. Still learning the best strategies, etc.

Update: haven't played in awhile, I should give this another go soon. Haven't felt a strong desire to get it to the table though, for some reason.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]10[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]After my initial burst of plays I was actually down on the game and only my kids' enjoyment kept me from trading it. As I continued to play I realized just how fun Clank is and it has become my favorite deck builder alongside Tyrants of the Underdark. Personally I wasn't a fan of what I'd call 1st generation deck builders where deck building was the whole game. I've really been enjoying the new deck builders that are coming out, where deck building is combined with other game mechanics. 

Getting back to the merits of Clank; number one is variety and replayability. The card diversity changes how games play out and strategies you can explore. There is more going on that first appears, but all of the card variety is layered on a very simple set of rules making Clank a breeze to teach. Also after a few plays we realized how dangerous ignoring the dragon and your clank can be. The threat of the dragon is certainly real, the more we've played the more reckless we've gotten which has resulted in a lot of death. 

Clank has definitely stood the test of time and has probably crept into my personal top 10 games [i](definitely my top 20)[/i]. Clank is a great next step family game and has been popular with gamers as well which is no small feat. I am very curious to see what Clank In Space brings to the table.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]This has been a huge surprise hit for me because I've played a lot of deck builders that I just don't like (many of them I'm in the minority on... like Dominion). What Clank does is similar to another deck builder I really like (Super Motherload) which is use deck building as one mechanic in the game. Clank also introduces the idea of moving throughout a dungeon collecting loot while also worrying about the amount of noise you make. Noise equals clank cubes going on the board and eventually into a bag when the dragon attacks. 

All of these mechanics lead to a very quick and exciting game where you are always deciding just how far you want to push your luck, will greed get the best of you? You can die in this game which may seem like a terrible idea to some gamers, but when that happens it triggers the final few rounds of the game when the dragon starts rampaging through the dungeon, attacking at will. While there isn't any direct conflict with other players, you really need to pay attention to other players movement because as soon as someone decides to book it out of the dungeon you know time is running short.

I think this game will appeal to a lot of gamers, it's definitely great for families. The rules are easy to teach, everything you do in the game is very intuitive and turns are quick. I'd definitely recommend checking out Clank especially if you play a lot of games with kids.[/i]

I was disappointed in this one. Basically it's the same as Ascension, which I like, but adds a map you have to move around. Because the luck of the card draft isn't enough luck, it then adds a layer more luck on whether you die or not. In my one game I died the turn before I was about to collect over half again of my score, so yeah there are some sour grapes. This kind of design might be ok in a 15 minute luck-fest, but not so much in a 45-60 min long affair. Not one I need to play again, especially when Ascension already fills this niche nicely in a more suitable timeframe.

Competitive Ascension-style deckbuilder with a map. Each player is a hero, delving in a dungeon. There is a big push-your-luck aspect where you try to get the best relic you can, but then escape alive. After one player escapes, the others are likely to take damage every turn until they get out as well. 

Out of 100 cards, there are 2 that hurt everyone else when played, and a few more that hurt everyone when bought. That seems minor enough not to be a problem. There is also some opportunity for hate-drafting, but at least it will cost you to do so. 

Overall, it looks like one that might be fun to play. Not one I want to buy, partly due to the full-size box.

Clank! is a deck-building game that revolves around moving your pawn around a dungeon board and grabbing as much loot as you can. Cards are available to be bought through an Ascension-style continuous offer. Some cards force you to Clank, meaning you put a cube in a bag, and when a dragon card enters the offer, a certain number of cubes is drawn, and those players take a wound. Once a player's HP is exhausted, the player is either eliminated or loses out on a big bonus, depending on how deep a player is in the dungeon. Players can also leave the dungeon, which accelerates the dragon attacks and thus introduces a push-your-luck element to the game. While the deck-building aspect felt very much like Ascension, the board play was very unique and interesting for a deck-building game. On the whole, this was a fun little romp.

My first impression isn't very good, but I would have to play more games to see if this holds up. There are a lot of good aspects to the game: I like the three different currencies, the push-your-luck aspect of the clank! cubes, and the deck-building in general. But the board and flow of the game don't match with the deck-building aspect and introduce too much luck to the game in my opinion. Drawing the right combination of cards on the right spot can really make a difference, and you can also get stuck if you don't get the right things. Good cards go to waste easily and a rushing strategy can really mess everybody up. This deduces the fun and satisfaction you get from the deck building.

Interesting deck builder which is a race/point salad game.  I liked how many turns a player still had options to use something in their hand to move/attack/buy.  It had a nice theme.  I liked its mechanism to hurry people back to the starting point.

The base game could use more maps and various cards for variability.  It seemed to be more tactical since there were only a few cards of certain ones in the game.  I wish there was a better healing mechanism.

Deck Building and dungeon crawling are a good combination. The Clank mechanism is fun and if you stay in the dungeon too long, you will die. All good. But.. the dungeon itself is boring. All the excitement is in the cards you turn over, none of it is on the board. For me, that's too remote.

Man this has been a recent hot game for sure. It is a standard deck builder like [thing=69789][/thing]. This game however, has a game board where you are working your way down through the dungeon of the castle to collect treasures and get out before the dragon kills you. It was an interesting twist, though quite simple. So many tokens to set up and place, it hardly seems like a game I will just take out and play. You think there are so many Dominions, well this will take equally or more time to set up. Maybe I will just stick with [thing=147020][/thing]. This is a find game for sure, just not one I have to play again, but I wouldn't MIND playing again.

Enthusiastically received by many, I felt there were few interesting decisions to be made and the 'no-brainer' cards were eagerly snapped up. I was disappointed by the deck-building aspect which has not evolved from Ascension (or Dominion, really - 9 years!): in fact it had gone backwards with the paucity of Trashing (1 card in two games).* Worse, in some respects, not getting to play with your cool cards was something I'd've hoped to not see again after playing Baseball Highlights where your newly acquired card goes onto your deck, not into your discard. That all sounds more negative than I feel, but expectations will do that to you. It's OK, would prefer some rule/card tweaks.

*If the designers were worried about people trashing Clank cards - and so breaking the central threat mechanism - just say 'Trash a non-Clank'; or, have a Minion Character that runs off (Trashes itself at the same time) with a card from your hand, or an On Acquire power that just triggers once. To be playing with a handful of complete crud at the end of the game is, if not ridiculous, very annoying.

Very fun deckbuilder. The "adventure" aspect is very well done, adding a new dimension of pressure and pacing to the game in addition to the normal pressure of timing the "build economy, use economy to get points" transition common to so many deckbuilders. Ultimately feels a bit like a racing game. Great art, good flavor.

Wow! Klong nimmt einen richtig beschissenen Mechanismus (Press your luck) und holt einfach alles raus! Das Card Drafting spielt sich locker, wirkt dabei aber nie zu mächtig und taktisch. Dabei ist man immer hin- und hergerissen zwischen "runterheizen und die teuren Schätze abkassieren" und "im sicheren Teil ein bisschen rumdümpeln und schnell wieder rausflitzen". Vorallem das fantastische, ohne Ende spannende Endgame reißt mich einfach jedes Mal mit- am Tisch wird gejubelt, gebrüllt und geschimpft; letzteres vorallem von mir, weil ich dieses Spiel einfach immer verliere. Und trotdem macht es einfach Spaß und packt mich jedes Mal aufs neue- sagt alles!

Clank has some fun elements but still suffers from my usual problem with deckbuilders - downtime. There just isn't enough happening on other players' turns that affects me so it feels like it can take an awful long time to come back round. I also feel that push-your-luck works better in repeated short bursts than just once over the length of a whole hour-plus game.

Esto hizo la partida demasiado corta, sin dar posibilidad de explorar todo el mapa, agarrar las otras reliquias, o armar un mazo con mas opciones.

Egész érdekes koncepció, hogy pakliépítés mellett van játéktábla is. Ráadásul a fakockák és a meeple figurák teljesen azt az érzetet adják, mintha egy eurogém lenne.
A játékban kissé ügyetlen, állandóan zörgő hangot kiadó tolvajokat alakítunk, akik lemerészkednek a mélybe, hogy onnan minél több zsákmánnyal térjenek vissza... élve. Az egészet nehezítik a felbukkanó szörnyek, valamint az ügyetlenkedésünkre állandóan felzaklatott sárkány.

Pros:
1. Integrated Board - This is the first deck builder where the board felt like an essential piece of the game.
2. Variability - There are a ton of cards with lots of interesting things to do.
3. Fun - This game is just flat out a good time. Collecting treasure, fighting monsters, all while pushing you luck.
4. Luck - There is just the right amount of luck in this game to keep it interesting. New players can pull of the win, but experienced players have more advantages.

Cons:
1. Variability - While I also consider this a strength, the large variability in the cards make it nearly impossible to build cool combos.
2. Theme and Mechanics are Disjointed - This is always an issue with a deck builder. Your deck consists of actions, and items, companions. So, it's not clear what your deck actually represents. I'd consider this a rather minor problem.

Summary: This is a great deck building game. All around just love this game. Great artwork, clean mechanics, and fun to play. Highly recommend purchasing this game.

Exactly what I want in a deck building game, deck building and avdenture! A great combination of market style deck building with great board play. Venture below in search of treasure but don't make to much noise or you'll wake the dragon causingredients him to lash out at you and/or your fellow players. Do you take the time to journey on to the darkest depths in search of the most valuable artifacts or grab the first piece of loot you see and high tail it up to back to the town earning bonus points and put the pressure on your opponents? Love this game.

RATING: 5.5
I'm generally not a fan of deck builders as I find them too random to provide much in the way of thoughtful play, and Clank! does nothing to change my opinion.  If anything, it revels in randomness - constantly punishing and rewarding players through luck of the draw.
However, even I can't deny that Clank! is ridiculously charming and novel.  If you enjoy having silly chaos in your games, or otherwise really enjoy the deck-building genre, Clank! is worth checking out.

Makes all other stand-alone deck building games obsolete. Serves as a good intro to deck building too, so that's great.

However, I'm not sure if it's a family game, it combines two mechanisms (dungeon crawling and deck building) which might be overwhelming to some people.

Very good deckbuilder, because it's not just plain old deck building. There is push your luck and various other innovative mechanics that give this one an upper hand on other deckbuilders. I think I will like not only the theme, but also some of the changes to mechanics in Clank! in Space better than this one. I will probably get it instead. Would definitely play this one regularly.

You're a thief attempting to burgle a dragon's hoard. Be swift but be quiet lest you want to end up in the dragon's belly. This game is a unique and good twist to your usual run-of-the-mill deck building games. It introduces a board which you traverse to score points and the deck represents the actions you can take on said board. The cards are easy to read and intuitive. Very easy to learn and play, but has great depth.

A have a very mixed feeling about Clank! When it works, it is a wonderful experience, you are all laughing, mocking those who are in a bad situation or praying for the right cards or are standing just before the exit of the dungeon with and praying for a lucky draw from the dragon bag. 
It is a game about stories to tell: once I have teleported into a closed room without a key knowing that the only way out will present itself only after I redraw the exact same card. Another time (with the first expansion) I laughed in a scuba gear as my friend reached a treasure underwater without a scuba gear just to die a horrible suffocating death like the bad guys in a B category Indiana Jones movie.
But thenn there are those games, where there is no tension, really, just like yesterday. Actually at the end of the game the bag was empty, all but one players escaped and all felt it was the most boring game we played in a while....
Which is the true face of Clank!? I have to play more to find it out...

This is the game DungeonQuest should have been. The deck-bulding provides a good chunk of decision making, along with the ability to carve your own path through the dungeon. Clank cubes, representing noise/danger, create a real sense of impending doom. As soon as one player picks up an artifact, it's a mad dash to pick up any remaining treasure on the way back to the exit. Very exciting, even when an unlucky draw gets your character killed a few steps away from glory.

This game was over-hyped, in my opinion.  It is fine.  I would play it again if other people asked to play.  I have no particularly strong feelings about it one way other the other.  I can simply say that Dominion is my preferred game in every sense.

This game is just a weak version of Dominion with a board/dungeon cluttering the game play.  I found it fiddly and a tad frustrating when other players interfered with my plans.

The components and artwork are great.

I'm a big Dominion fan and never thought I'd enjoy a deck builder as much.  However, this game is a blast to play.  It's less strategic but the theme is really engaging. The card play it an open structure so you can play your cards in any order but you always have to play all of them.   It's probably in the category of don't take it too seriously as its more about the adventure and pushing your luck than just winning.   There is a moderate amount of luck with card draw and dragon cube draw.   But it's just fun to run in  and try to outdue your opponent.  My only real concern is the replay ability as you only have two boards to chose from.  Hopefully it will not be too same-y after a few plays.

Update: played the backside map and unfortunately my second play wasn't nearly as enjoyable as the first.  Plagued with frustrating card draw and back luck but it seems that the right side of the board is not nearly as fruitful at the side with the 30 and 25 but just as treacherous.  I can't see ever going to the right side again on this board.  I struggled to move while my opponent waltzed right down got the 30 then a bag and then a 25 before I got to my first artifact.  Then he beat me out  and I still didn't make it.  It was pure frustration this time around.  I lost by 61 points.  We haven't play a close game yet of this so I hope this is not a trend.  The rating  and my feeling for this game is very fluid so I expect this rating to change often.

Played with Alan and Scott. It was a learning game for Scott and I. I thought the concept was good, but as Shane mentioned in his write up of the game it seems like there are only a few desirable cards that get snatched up fast and are far between. As a result Alan got all those good cards (they'd show up on his turn). So Alan had good productive long turns, while mine were short. Too much waiting around time for the one player that gets the good combos and not enough play for the rest. I'll have to give it another try though.

An instant hit for me. A great deck building game that uses a board and you can actually see your progress with movement and collection of tokens. I am also a huge fan of the bag building aspect with clank and drawing for damage! Brilliant! My only very minor issue (with limited plays) was that there didn't seem to be a lot of deck thinning cards that became available. I can't wait to play this some more and get the expansion for the new board and underwater aspects.

I have cooled on Clank since my initial plays, but to me, it remains a commendable entry in the deck-builder genre. Its system is streamlined and intuitive enough that even non-gamers can soon grasp the object of play, while still providing novel synergies for gamers to find satisfaction in the gameplay. The theme is rather generic, but alas, tried and true, and serves to fit the game very well. The fun-factor can wane over too frequent of plays, and of course you are subject to the whim of the clank cube draw. The game does provide a handful of ways to mitigate clank, and regardless of what people may complain about, managing your clank cubes really does make a significant impact. Overall, this is a solid medium-level filler game, though I fear it, and its "sequel", will likely be eclipsed someday. 

(+) Streamlined deck-building gameplay.
(+) Retains a race-like feeling by presenting treasure acquisition on a first-dibs basis and the risk of losing it all by overstaying your welcome.
(+) Accessible to non-gamers and provides crunchy decisions for those more strategically oriented.

(-) Generic fantasy trope theme.
(-) Luck plays a large role (can be mitigated)
(-) Does not offer much variety (in deck-building choices or depth of gameplay) after several plays.

Played this with a group of folks at PAX south.  Tried this due to high recommendation via dice tower.. what was Tom smoking?  Hype is undeserved.  Just about everything is based entirely on luck with little strategy (random card draws, random block/cube draws, random shuffling of your deck, etc.).  Going first puts you at a serious advantage over the other players.  The only thing that could be good is if the Dragon posed a real threat so that getting in and getting out was actually a winning strategy.  Once the players realize it's not, they just linger below and the game lasts forever getting more boring every turn as there is no incentive to leave.

Solid game but not sure if it deserves the 8 rating.  It's a combination of deck building and racing.  Easy to learn, plays fast but very few tough decisions to be made.

Played this at GenCon 2016. The game plays almost exactly like Ascension with a board movement component. There are several resources you gain from cards, movement, fight, and purchasing power. The victory condition is whoever has the most 'treasure' at the end of the game. Simply escaping from the dungeon gives you 20 bonus coins.

I felt this game could be fun for a couple play through, but suffered from being to reliant on luck during the early game, the late game then greatly favors whoever got lucky at the beginning. Once you get 'behind' it felt like there was very little I could do to catch up.

In the end I felt like this was a game that didn't do anything novel or interesting enough on its own to justify purchasing it.

Ascension with a board is a very good description.  The card buying mechanic and beating up monsters is taken straight from that, but the third option, of moving around the board, and deciding how far to delve into the dungeon before heading back, and the clank mechanic, are nice little touches.

Very fun deckbuilding game with a cool new mechanic. You're delving deep underground to steal a treasure from the dragon and trying to escape in time to be able to keep your loot.

RATING: 6
It's a dungeon-crawl-themed deck-building game with a board, and cards that generate three currencies, one of which is used to buy cards and the other two are used to interact with the board.  It seemed to have a fair number of moving parts, and the only novel mechanic was that some cards generated "clank" as a penalty, which is damage that gets buffered up in a bag and drawn later when anyone triggers dragon attacks.  I won handily by playing it safe, grabbing some shallow treasure and running out, while the other two players died due to delving too deep.  Like every other deckbuilding game with a board that I've played, I felt like the board was an unnecessary complication and that I would have preferred a game that was contained entirely within the deck of cards, likely using some to track state in a way distinct from just being shuffled into your deck.

The best implementation of a deck-building game with a game board that I've played. I wish there was a bit more deck thinning available, and maybe more to do with fight, but I'm looking forward to more plays to see if these are really problems or if my expectations just need to be adjusted!

Clank is a fun push your luck deck building race game. It's similar to Ascension, but with 5 currencies that work together better than the 2 in Ascension.

Ascension meets RPG elements is essentially what Clank boils down to. But, it does it in such a refreshing deck-building way that everyone who plays this game that I've played with enjoyed the game, and the replay-ability.

What makes clank different? It's a dungeon-crawling deck builder. In most deck builders you can go heavy into one strategy, and usually expect to accumulate a lot of points with that, but Clank takes a different approach. You actually have to BALANCE your point generating cards with things like MOVEMENT and COMBAT, and perhaps even HEALING or else you will score 0. Yes, there's a way for you to score absolutely nothing, and that in my opinion is amazing.

The game offers many different strategies, and FORCES you to adapt to the trade row. Do you usually like to go for the larger point artifacts? Great! But what if not many movement/gold generating cards appear in the trade row? Gotta switch it out! I love that fact.

Disregard comments about: "This is all about luck" or "There is no flavor to this game" or "This doesn't add anything new." That's completely ludicrous. Positive reviews generally explain what is great about the game, and while negative reviews can offer constructive criticism, it's usually hypocritical when you look at their "favorite games" and see a purely luck based game, or a bland game in their library. Clearly, they missed the point.

That being said, the only reason I gave this review an 8.5 instead of a 10 is because I feel like they could have certainly added more depth to the cards. Don't get me wrong, the variety/mechanics of the game are splendid and solid, but I feel like there could have been more interesting mechanics with the cards you acquire. That being said, an 8.5 means I love this game and would still recommend it, just I have other games I probably would prefer over it.

A very clever combination of the rotating-gallery deckbuilding format pioneered by Ascension, coupled with the push-your-luck aspect of Deep Sea Adventure. It doesn't break new ground, but is a fun experience nonetheless. 

I only wish that there were more options to cull cards. Culling cards and increasing deck efficiency is sort of central to a deckbuilding experience for me, and it was a bit disappointing to find only two options present in the game that I played.

Let's face it, this is the best deckbuilder that has been made to date as of 7/17/17. I don't own it, but I can already see the mass appeal after only one play. I am a fan of deckbuilders, so this is one I really ought to own because it really is fantastic. Great tension coming out of the cave. Will comment more when I get more plays.

RATING: 8
It's Ascension with a game board.    No seriously, that's EXACTLY what this is.

However, it's the board that makes all the difference.  Maneuvering around the board on your quest to score points adds a dimension of depth that Ascension has tried (and largely failed) to accomplish.   Further, it establishes a far more cohesive theme and the feeling that you are actually competing against the other players, rather than the players each playing solitaire at the same table that you get with Ascension.

The unpredictability of the dragon attacks adds a fun dimension of excitement as well.  It is random, of course, but exactly the right level of random to add fun to the game without making it feel like your play is completely at the mercy of the fates.

If there is one drawback it is that the points aren't quite balanced right.  With the current point weights, there is no incentive to get any artifact beyond the cheap ones near the surface and beeline to the exit.    (I understand this has been addressed in Clank! In! Space! but this review isn't about that game.)

RATING: 8
Only a few plays so far but it's an easy to teach game which melds deck building with a game board. The "Clank" mechanism uses a bag to select player damage...a tactile method a prefer over a static dice tower. The game drags in the beginning but once each player starts to enhance their decks it picks up steam as players race to grab as much loot as they can before being trapped in the dungeon. It's a solid game with press your luck, dungeon explore and deck building elements...sure to scratch one or more of the proverbial gamer's itches.

surprisingly fun game. Plays in 35-45 minutes, easy and not really deep, but short enough to focus on fun and not worry about lack of real strategy.
Not coming from a deck building POV (as I do not often play DB games) I can easily forgive shortcomings in that department - maybe I even like what others would criticize. Close to best buy in 2016 so far

Strong reviews/comments for this dungeon-delving deckbuilder.

After one play: I like this quite a bit - it might compete with Thunderstone for me in the dungeon crawl DBG genre. I think the theme is stronge in this one. TS has Light as a sort of resolution currency, but it can simply be overcome with extra combat power. In Clank, if you don't have movement symbols you just can't move. I like that - it makes it more important. 

Moving around a map adds a lot to the game as well, similar to the way it does in Trains. 

I think I'd definitely get a copy if there wasn't already one in the group.

Amikor elkezdtem játszani rögtön a Trains jutott eszembe. Itt azonban a deckbuliding mechanizmussal nem építünk egy térképen, hanem egy sárkány és többfajta szörny által őrzött kazamatát rabolunk ki. Sokkal izgalmasabb téma, fantasztikusan szép kártyák és jól felépített dungeon. Rendkívül tetszett a hangoskodásunkkal ébredező sárkány ötlete. Minél hangosabbak vagyunk, annál nagyobb esélyünk, hogy minket kap el. Célunk a kazamatából megszerezni egy ereklyét és értékes tárgyakat, majd kislisszolni, míg el nem kap. Nagyon ötletes az a mechanizmus is, hogy ha valaki kiér, akkor még gyorsabban ébredezik a sárkány és sietni kell a többieknek is, mert ha lent maradnak végük. A játék időben is pontosan megfelelően gyors. Nehéz fogást találnom rajta, hirtelen csak a szerencsét tudom hozni, a zsákból húzás miatt, de nem zavart annyira. Ami jobban zavart, hogy az alapjátékban és az első kiegben is nagyon kevés olyan lap van, amivel csökkenthetjük a paklink méretét, pedig ez egy fontos elem a deckbuilding világában.
Ettől függetlenül nagyon tetszett.

I enjoyed the game at first but additional plays kinda left me wanting more. Its difficult to try a different tactic since you can only really play based off what cards are available for you to buy and since those are completely random its just going along for the ride.

Once again, when it comes to deck building games I still rather just play Dominion.

Well designed family game. Certainly a pleasant and unoffensive game, however it's very light and definitely not a strategy game. The card drafting and dungeon crawling mix seamlessly and make for good times. It's satisfying collecting loot and improving your card pool. It's simple enough for kids to play but there's also enough to keep seasoned gamers interested. I wouldn't recommend it though if you are looking for a chunky euro or something epic.

RATING: N/A
Played this a couple of times at CastleCon and really enjoyed many aspects of this ... It is a deck builder, of course, but also a race game - trying to race into the dungeon and grab more treasures than anyone else before the dragon devours you.  
The race itself though presents choices ... The paths in the Dungeon are maze like in that there are numerous ways to get through them ... and the first out of the dungeon starts a game wind-down mechanic.  

You can make an effort to obtain a key so you can take shortcuts or hopefully buy a flying carpet ... or run like hell trying to move as fast as possible ... hopefully drawing "swords" when you need them to defeat monsters in the tunnels ... 

You can only grab one of the main treasures so do you grab one worth 5 pts near the entrance or go deeper to attempt to grab one worth 25 or 30 points.  Everyone else is making the same decisions as they race through the place ...

deck-building with a board, similar to Trains; the game timer, cube bag, and the above/below aspect are what help this game stand out in the deck-building genre, but still this is a mere shadow of Dominion as a deck-builder; first expansion seems to increase randomness and increase the sense that this is a very mediocre deck-builder, perhaps monsters should have their own deck and 'buy' row to help reduce randomness, wish there was a larger ratio of interesting cards... some cards are sorta meh

RATING: 9
This is a deck-building adventure/race game.  I remember there was a lot of love for Trains when it first came out because it was a deck building game with a board.  I personally wasn't that impressed with Trains but this game takes that deck builder with a board conceit and does it much much better.  Along with improving your deck by getting skill points and using those to purchase cards you also collect movement and combat points to move around a dungeon map and fight monsters.  Many of the spaces on the map have special properties and the main goal of the game is to collect a valuable artifact and make it out of the dungeon.

The namesake comes from the fact that many actions in this game make "Clank" or more simply put, noise.  This is represented by colored cubes matching your player color which are put into a big bag and occasionally the dragon attacks by pulling cubes from the bag and the noisiest players are more likely to be attacked.

This is what I was hoping to get out of Trains, I like deck builders and I love the idea of another gameplay layer on top of it.  This plays so quickly and has a lot of variability.  I came in last place my first time playing it but I was one movement point from coming in first.  I pressed my luck to get more points and ALMOST made it out.  Those kind of butt clenching moments that could make or break you are part of what makes a great game.

I can't help but be a little disappointed by the quality.  The cards and art are fine but everything is cardboard or cubes past that.  There are so many amazing looking games that have come out over the past couple years that maybe I'm just a little spoiled.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a deckbuilder that makes excellent use of a board. In this game you are adventuring into a dungeon to find treasures while trying not to wake the dragon and making it out alive. 

This game has a lot of potential, but just wasn't a winner for me. I found the cards not very interesting, most either give you boots, swords, or clank. So sometimes it feels like you could just rolled a dice for each of those categories instead and get the same feel :(. Maybe the expansion will fix some of these issues?  The board has two sides so it adds some variety by offering two different dungeons to explore. I'm not sure about long term replayability though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Great game, lots of fun. I love the idea of not making noise, which is something that immediately creates a connection to the theme of the game. The main mechanism is not new which proves that a reimplementation of something already done can really work and actually be favorable to the design, turning it much easier to understand and play.

Interesting deck builder game where you have to plunged into a dungeon and get some artefacts before the resident dragon is going to kill you.
I liked the idea that players have to put "Clank" into a bag and then when the dragon awakes at random those "Clank" cubes get revealed at random out of the bag. In the bag is also some dragon clank cubes which means you avoided the bullet of getting hit points.
Quick and easy game with killing monsters on the way, collecting money, grab an artefact and get the hell back to the surface before it's too late

A deck building race/point accumulator game with a great sense of humour, interaction via meddling with the environment and simple rules. It has the genre typical decision of when to stop building your deck and transfer to point scoring but what makes this interesting is this has consequences for the other players as it not only  accelerates the end game but can cause the other players to lose points (the mastery token) or even be eliminated.

Deck building for movement and actions to get the most treasure! But beware the dragon. Really well done. Light, fast, but doesn't feel trivial, tedious, or overly random. The Clank mechanic with the dragon adds this awesome tension that can lead to some really dramatic moments. Not sure how the game will hold up after a ton of plays. Seems like replayability is a bit limited. Other than that, everything I'd want from a deckbuilder and more. I love that there is now a spatial element to the typical deckbuilding formula too.

Best part of this game is that it really appeals to a large audience. Fantastic gateway game, but enough meat for more experienced gamers to really dig into. Most importantly though, it's just a ton of FUN.

I like deckbuilding games, but it feels to me like there is a glut of them, because it's cheaper to only produce a couple decks of cards. I like that this game has more substance to it.

tl;dr: fun, light deckbuilder

This is a mixture between [thing=36218][/thing] and an adventure game. The deck building is very standard but it does use a mix of fixed cards and a moving row of available cards. Also: some cards are not bought but defeated (like in [thing=53953][/thing]).
The adventure part has you go in a dungeon, encountering obstacles, finding valuable items and making sure that you make it out on time.
There is a big luck factor in what items you turn over. If you're looking for a certain type of item and you never turn it over, tough luck.
While you play your cards, you might make noise, this makes the dragon angry, and he might hurt you because of it. So managing the amount of noise you make is an important part of the game.
This is quite enjoyable, but it is very light. This is not a deep strategic game.

Essen 2016, overpriced copy, but FOMO got the best of me :-)
This is a fun game. Deckbuilding with a board (like Trains), meeples and fun push-your-luck element: do I risk going deeper into the dungeon to get to that really valuable artefact, or do I cut my losses and rush back up to trigger the end game forcing my opponents to get above ground as well? The clank cubes are also a cool addition, you really feel the dragon's hot breath in your neck when you have a lot of cubes out.
Plays well with 2, but enjoyed it even more at higher player counts.

not sure yet, doesn't look appealing
"Dominion" with a theme slabbed on?

+ innovative ?
+ second board included as advanced variant
- quite abstract and illogical
- artwork (board looks almost like a prototype)
- deckbuilding not my thing
- heavily card-based (sleeves necessary)
- player elimination ?
- very expensive

They say there is a dragon, but you don't see it and it just causes random damage.
Why is there no dragon pictured on that board?

It's odd that you get a lot of CLANK while doing nothing, just from stumbling. I really think this should be only on strong cards or from a few general effects.
And it's super odd, that you can get damage from your CLANK way later after you made noise in the dungeon when you're already far away.

Ranking at the top of current board games that I play with my lovely girlfriend is Clank!  For much of its (usual) 60—75 minute duration, this game is a point salad free for all, but this 360 degree scramble is given some direction in that the board is a dungeon delver and there are a limited number of gettable items.  Add to this a simple deck building mechanism that multiplies possibilities and creates a puzzle, and the resultant game is a unique and fun conflation.  And then there’s that very fun (and ominous) press-your-luck titular mechanic with the dragon bag, from which cubes (wounds) are drawn.

Overall, Clank! is easy to learn and a lot of lighthearted fun....but once somebody exits the dungeon, the countdown to death begins, and the pressure and intensity increase immediately.  Kind of like Mage Knight (simplified) meets Super Mario Brothers in a subterranean Candyland.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The deck building is a bit simpler and more complex than Dominion: fewer cards available, but every card might come out. Like Trains, Clank has unlimited actions and buys, and additionally unlimited fights. You also get coins (you buy with "influence") to use in store spaces in the dungeon. (Clank refers to noise you make that disturbs the dragon.) You win by getting out with the most points; you lose by dying.

3/30/2017: Hm..... Deck building and dungeon explore. This is certainly one of the recent evolution of deck building within board game. The combination of deck building and dungeon exploration is something new and refreshing. There is also element of push your luck in this game that is quite interesting (i.e. dragon attack). 

I was able to win the game by being the second player to get out alive. It makes me wonder if the winner is always the last player coming out of the dungeon or not, since the first player won't be able to buy any more cards and trigger the dragon attack. 

I definitely want to play this game again. :)

I played twice, second time, I was just behind someone, who was vacuuming up all the treasures ahead of me, buying all the cards I wanted. Took a long time just to wait to lose. Not going to happen every time, but man, it CAN happen and its a lousy experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Clank applies a unique theme to the deckbuilding-with-a-board genre currently occupied by games like Trains and Automobiles.  I think the theme in this is great.  You are adventurers delving underground, trying to get as much loot as possible and get back to the ground surface.  The dragon attacks people with growing ferocity, and the target of his attack is based on how much noise (or "clank") you make while running around.

The deck building is pretty good.  There are 4 currencies: skill (like gold in Dominion), feet (which let you move through the dungeon), gold (primarily worth VPs), and swords.  The swords let you move through monsters without taking damage, or you can "kill" some cards in the market to get rewards.  The game uses the Ascension/Star Realms-style market of 6 random cards, although they do not immediately replace.  I generally prefer that Dominion-style market, but I think the random market works well here.  It works because some cards cause dragon attacks when revealed and some cards do other effects when revealed.  Something like that wouldn't work with the Dominion-style.

Movement on the board is pretty interesting.  There are a lot of paths to choose and those whole thing is one giant exercise in push-your-luck.  You can buy items like keys (for locked doors) and backpacks (to hold more treasure).  There are also exploration tiles that give you random bonuses, and get stronger as you go deeper.

Overall, the game comes together nicely.  There is a lot of luck, but it feels fitting with the theme and push-your-luck element.  In my first game I tried to sprint and grab a treasure, then get out and leave everyone to get eaten.  I ended up making so much noise that I died to random dragon attacks on the turn before I was about to make it back to the castle.  At least you still get points when you die, you just don't get the bonus points.  I'd like to try it a few more times to explore different strategies.

Good thing about games that copy elements from Dominion is that it can be easily taught to players familiar with the Dominion concept.
Biggest difference probably lies in the fact that the effects of your cards played doesn't depend on in which order you played the cards, thus I had a slight feeling of flying in autopilot. That being said, what you buy really makes your deck and offers a much bigger basic variance in contrast to your average Dominion, where everyone adds cards from a choice of ten card piles to his deck. In Clank, every round offers you new options to alter your deck in completely different ways. Deckbuilding spiced up with elements of Push-your-luck is a very enjoyable mixture. At least, in this case it is!

A pleasant game of pushing luck and building decks, and does a remarkable job of both. Boasts a lot of randomness, but it obviously isn't intended as a rigorous affair — best for those who are willing to chuckle when they get bit by the dragon or get stuck in place by their pack of loot.

RATING: 5
Pound for pound, there are better deck builders out there.... In terms of perfected design, Clank falls short of titles like Dominion, Vikings Gone Wild, and Hero Realms where the game chose an idea an executed it stunningly, Clank falls noticeably short. Now that said, where Clank excels (enough to match scores, in Dominions case in my mind) is that while it lacks the same polish in what it does, it does some things that are really deeply original and fun. Similar to how Legendary is frankly a mess compared to some other deck builders but still has a place with the best of them because of how in touch it is with its theming and the fun metamarratjve components that come with that and it's shear versatility in scenarios, Clank's card pool is lacking in both size and complexity... There's no factions or subtypes and cross card synergies are minimal. Things can feel slow with a bad hand while the best hands don't elicit the excitement they might in other games, and ultimately has some issues of polish... What it DOES have is a totally novel feature in its favor, that not only is your hand simulating you vs dungeon (not the more common PVP or players vs Villain/s), but that the board and it's many features. The noise mechanic for simulating dragon aggro is in particular a brilliant reconciliation of RNG and strategy it's easy to see why they titled the greater game after it. There are enough complications, optio
ns, rewards, and mechanics on the board to make a game all on its own, combined with adeckbuilder, and any shortcomings are forgivable for the "Quality" of a more unique take on the genre. Definitely a must play for Deckbuilder fans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First play impression: Just pure fun. The main mechanic is simply Ascension and similar games, so you only need to learn a few rules about how the board works as long as you're already familiar with that style of deckbuilder. This means you can jump right in and start running around the dungeon even on your first time playing without being bogged down with rules.

It does seem like getting certain good cards early on can have a big impact on the game. I was able to remove both of my starting clank cards early in the game, but none of the other players had a chance to cull their deck just because the right cards never came up on their turns. However, this can happen in most deckbuilders and I'll need to play more to see how significant the luck factor is.

Update: I still stand by this game being fun, but after more plays it does seem like the randomness is pretty significant. There are very few cards that let you thin your deck or draw more cards, so you're left to the luck of the draw and it's hard to pull off any sort of card-specific combos. The cards that you can buy add another layer of randomness. Sometimes the perfect cards come up for a player and you watch them pull off a huge combo. Then on your turn there is nothing but low-value junk. I put this game into a category along with Mystic Vale, Star/Hero Realms, Jump Drive, and a few other games: they're lots of fun to play, but the luck of the draw is a deciding factor so they're not to be taken too seriously.

This is a very fun deck-builder game. It takes the normal deck-builder and adds a board very much like the game Trains, but where this game surpasses Trains is in the theme and fun department. Pressing your luck and trying to go just a little farther to grab that shiny artifact, then getting torched alive by the dragon because you were making too much noise. I have yet to live through a game but have had a blast both times.  Player elimination usually happens so close to the end of the game it's not really a big deal.

Clank may not be a perfect game,  but if there is a flaw in it's design, I have yet to uncover it after numerous engaging plays.

It is unlike many other deck builders, in that the process of thinning your deck is nearly nonexistent. This makes it less of an exercise in optimization and more of just simply playing the odds. The bottom line being, this game is just pure. plain fun and one of the most impressive efforts I have ever come across in the genre.

With it's two-sided board. 100 dungeon cards and many avenues to victory,  this is a game with nearly unlimited replay value.  This will dominate my table for a long, long time.

:star: cool theme that is handled well
:star: I like how there are basically five currencies in the game, and all of them have distinct uses
:star: I like the fact that cards in the center row have arrive, acquire and danger effects - the arrive effects add some unpredictability which is necessary in a game like this, and the acquire and danger effects are decision points
:star: the push your luck aspect in the artifact placement (and recovery) is great

:nostar: only 4 players
:nostar: feels like there are a bit too many black cubes in the game
:nostar: negative clank cards are really strong for their cost, and because of the central row mechanism they aren't always available, so getting them is a matter of luck, not skill

I had my reservations going into Clank! as I'm not a huge dungeon-crawler or fantasy fan. Those concerns proved to be unwarranted.

Clank! offers a fun blend of deckbuilding, push-your-luck, and exploration. You don't cycle your deck often enough to reap the rewards of much synergy but there is an arc to your dekcbuilding, starting with inexpensive cards that allow you to combat small monsters or explore further and leading to cards that clog your deck but offer many victory points.

The market on the board is neat as well, forcing the players to funnel toward the center of the cave and offering the choice of easier movement or the chance of greater riches.

This game is amazing. I can teach it to anyone. It is a push YOUR luck game. If someone looses it is often from their own fault. Nothing feels worse than playing a game and getting picked on by those around your. Clank is very much the best and most accessible deck building game I have ever played. Having a board to physically represent what is happening is what the deck building genre needed for new players. It is certainly the best game of 2016 for me and the expansion was a no brainer to preorder.

Love deck-building games and I love the competitive nature of Clank! It presents players with interesting choices (rush an early relic or get a more valuable one) and has great variety in the types of decks you can end up with. 

The double-sided map and random placement of artifacts adds variety. 

Recent addition of a free app that also allows solo play has somewhat improved my rating of the game but not a lot. The added game-mode is decent but still prefer the game without app. Like having new options, though.

RATING: 7
Clank! is a deckbuilder with an actual board. The game has three types of currency: movement, skill (spend) and fight. The object of the game is to run into the castle/dungeon, grab as many points as you can and get safely back out.

You start with some cards that give you skill and movement, and of course, two 'Stumble' cards which add "Clank", noise. Whenever you make noise, you have to put one of your cubes on the board. Eventually the dragon will attack. At that point you put all those cubes on the board into the bag and draw cubes.

The bag starts with a bunch of neutral cubes, which generally aren't replaced, and any cubes that aren't drawn stay in the bag for subsequent rounds. The angrier the dragon gets the more cubes you draw for his attack. He gets angrier over the course of the game. Cubes represent damage to players. When your cubes are drawn you put them on your health track. If that fills up, you die. And lose. Well... technically if you make it out of the dungeon you don't lose, but you don't get a bonus for getting out safely.

Inside the castle there are many paths to follow. Moving requires spending movement, but there's all sorts of impediments to moving, like crystal caverns where you have to stop moving, paths that require you to fight a moster or take damage, paths that require keys, etc.

For some reason, there's a market in the dungeon. Don't ask. If you are at the market you can buy keys, backpacks and crowns there. There's also artifacts strewn around the dungeon, ranging in value from 5 to 30. Unless you have a backpack, you can only carry a single artifact... and you can never drop an artifact, so pick wisely.

There's a few cards that are always available to buy and a card display that replenishes at the end of each turn. There's all sorts of things you can buy to specialize your character.

Once any player dies or leaves the game, a clock starts and you only have a handful of turns to get out of the castle. Players who do that can get a bonus 20 points.

I enjoyed the game. It's got the "deckbuilder problem" that you can get randomly hosed if you draw things at the wrong times. That's a bit more painful given that there's more game here. There's also a random draw from the bag which can, and was, painfully random. Despite most players having roughly the same number of cubes put into the bag over the course of the game, when we checked the final distribution, one player only had 3 of their cubes left in the bag, out of 30 total cubes. Which meant that their cubes had been drawn a lot more often than other people's. Unsurprisingly, they died. It's still a relatively short game, so it's not the end of the world, but it is still a little annoying.

Clank really is the most thrilling deck-building game I own. And it's even better with the Sunken Treasures expansion. The deck-building aspect just combines really well with the interesting board layout and the risk taking. In most of our four player games at least one thief did not make it out of the dungeon -- the risk of dying really increases by the end of the game. I have played it with hobby gamers and casual gamers, adults and teens, and so far everybody loved it! There are not a lot of rules to the game, and the rules that are there are easy to explain. Looking forward to my next play!

Managed to play Clank at PAX West 2016 before its release. It's a really fun game, most similar to Tyrants of the Underdark. A deck builder with dungeon exploration and a very fast learn. The only flaw is that players can be eliminated randomly and quickly, and they have to sit out and watch the entire rest of the game without participation. 

What's worse, the press your luck element goes a little bit too far and says that players that die on the bottom half of the map have a score of ZERO at the end of the game, and thus already automatically know they lost, so they don't even have interest in the end result of the game.

I'd like to see a fan-made module to add or an expansion that allows dead players to interact with the game in a meaningful way. I'd also like to see this module provide a path for deceased players to be able to win the game, even if that path is more difficult and unlikely.

This is a fun deck-building game with the added element of a gaming board, tokens, and a menacing dragon named "Nikki" that is not fond of her treasure being stolen.  Clank! is a great game to play when friends get together and we are looking for quick action with a moderately short (60-90min) play time.  The theme is enjoyable and the looming doom track element adds great suspense to the game.

Finally broke down and bought it! When we played, I failed to see what the hype train was about. It's simple--more simple than I think people let on. The reskinning it into three games in less than a year attests to the semi pasted-on-theme and simplicity of gameplay. Lack of depth doesn't turn me off per se, as the depth and weight of games suit different moods. But I wasn't itching to play it again, and may want to sell it in the near future...

RATING: 3.5
deck-building game where you try to gather an artifect as well as victory points along the way. 
Everyone starts with the same 10 cards and then you can gradually enhance your deck. 
The game itself is not that bad, it's just the same problem as with every deckbuilder, the downtime is just too high and you are absolutely not interested in what your opponents do.
Therefore I don't liked the game but that has a lot to do with my distaste towards these kinda games. If you like thy type, you could definitely also like Clank!

You have entered a sleeping dragon's lair in search of precious artifacts. Don't make too much noise or else... CLANK! ... you'll wake the dragon.

Like many "deck builders" player interaction in this game is not super high. The addition of the push your luck dragon attacks and the dungeon board help make you feel like you are playing with the people at the table and not just beside them.  The base game feels great for now and I think you will get more than your money's worth from it. It is, however, the type of game that shines with expansions.

Good deck-building-with-a-purpose game. A sort of Dominion meets Deep Sea Arseholes (Adventure). Your deck of cards is used to buy more cards and to move into a dungeon and to fight monsters. As you delve down into the dungeon picking up treasure, you piss off the dragon, and when someone runs for the exit you better not be too far behind.

Interesting deckbuilder combined with a streamlined euro dungeon crawl (even if it is more reminiscent of my favourite "Dungeonquest").
However, it is a bit too much dependent on the luck of the draw (not only from the deck, but from the cube bag and from the Dungeon/market deck) to be really excellent.

Played this on 4/22/2017 and enjoyed it a lot but i'm bias because I really enjoy deck building games (except Dominion).  Caught on very early that you want to make sure you have quite a few movement cards in your deck otherwise when you get near the end of the game and are rushing to the exit you want to make sure you can actually escape!  I liked how the dragon attacked and that it was random, I liked how movement worked and how you can move around the board.  The cards were cool and later that evening I went through the deck just to see what else was in there and there are some very cool cards we didn't get to.  I have to say though, Mr. Whiskers saved my butt a few times !  Cool card especially when you keep drawing double clank cards :P  Would like to play this again for sure.

Light deckbuilder about stealing the dragon's treasure. Risk management is required to limit the damage caused by noise tokens. Probably not a good idea to escape the dungeon first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clank! is sort of Dungeon Quest fixed, via a deck building mechanism. Players are trying to explore a deadly dungeon, grab an expensive artifact and then escape before the dungeon's deadly dragon awakens and kills them.

As far as deck-builders go, this is completely by the numbers. If you have played any deck-builder before, you probably already know how to play this. Turn structure is play and resolve action cards, add up the gold and then buy new cards. Draw up to hand limit and then do it again.

What is different, is the map component. Your cards will generate three stats...movement, combat and clank. Movement pushes your pawn across the map. Combat kills any monsters you run across and clank puts one of your cubes into the noise pool. What's a noise pool? One of the coolest parts of the game.

Whenever the dragon awakes (typically through a card reveal in the market, about a third of the cards will trigger an awakening) all the cubes in the noise box go into a bag. Then a few are pulled out and every cube pulled that matches your color results in one damage. s the game goes on and the dragon gets angrier, more cubes are pulled in each attack.

Eventually someone will decide they have pushed their luck enough and it is time to break for the surface. As soon as that happens, the race is on. Every turn after the first player exits the dungeon, the dragon attacks escalate and draw more and more cubes from the bag. It is incredibly tense and in my experience thus far, every card draw becomes a piece of high drama after someone gets out.

If you are too deep and don't find the surface before you run out of hit points, you die.

This is an interesting take on the deckbuilding mechanism. The choices imposed by the board really distinguish it from most other games in the genre. It's a little too random for my taste (with the changing market plus the clank cube draw), so it can't topple a game like Dominion for me, but it's certainly enjoyable.

An evolved deck builder fantasy dungeon crawl using pouch pulling and point to point movement.  It is evolved in that the cards indicate more than the traditional buy points and combat points.  In addition, cards in a hand determine whether you make noise "clank" in the dungeon and when the guardian dragon attacks and how fast you delve.  The dungeon board is a maze of different paths leading to different rewards depending on the luck of the draw and how you build your deck.  The end game thematically incorporates a clever race of being chased to the surface by an increasingly pissed off dragon.

Edit ranking:  From 8.5 to 7.

In one of the first two games played(2-player) dungeon row became stale and no one wanted to buy cards. A few months later in games three and four(4-player) it happened again so I just sucked it up and bought cards so we could start to cycle through the deck.  Well this helped the person after me and then we it got back to my turn I was often stuck with cards that didn't benefit me again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
Minimal player interaction.  A handful of cards cause minor harm to other players, and there are enough spaces on the board that you can't really block someone else from completing the mission.

Very difficult to set up a good deck.  The available cards to purchase are randomized (shuffled) before the game.  Even if you manage to purchase  cards from a single faction, the card synergies hardly provide any benefit.  Decks feel like you end up with a random assortment of cards and just hope you draw enough that are useful each hand.

It's not a bad game, but it could have been better.  The deck building is pretty weak, and the board play isn't substantial enough to pick up the slack.

RATING: 6.5
I haven't given a half-star rating in years, but this one earns it.

There's a real sense of dungeoneering in Clank!, and the noise/rage/dragon mechanic is a blast. It's just too easy for an imminent loser (or smart aleck) to snatch an artifact, race to the exit, and prematurely end the fun.  Perhaps the "advanced" board fixes this issue?

I will say that, of all the deck- and bag-building games with boards (Trains, Automobiles, Hyperborea, Tyrants of the Underdark, A Few Acres of Snow, etc.), this is my favorite.

I do wish that Clank's board were less onerous to set up.  Sometimes you just want to sit down and play, and not waste time with extensive pre-game prep.  But if everyone pitches in, I suppose Clank's chit chores aren't too severe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the deck building aspect of the game. More games should employ this feature. My critique of the game is the fact that there is a limited strategy to the game which limits the game's replay ability. You are limited to only two "game boards".  From several plays, owing to the way the game boards are laid out, there is a clear strategy to winning.  The game board should have been designed in a way that it was interchangeable with multiple different tiles for each level of the dungeon. This would have prevented a set strategy from evolving when playing the game. Currently the way it is designed is that the deeper one goes the greater the reward. This fact leads many players to not go for the deeper reward, but instead they go for the 20 point marker and then get out quickly to earn the twenty point bonus for escaping plus whatever they pick up along the way. The person going for the thirty has a much tougher chance of winning. this leads to a sameness in the game's strategy. There has also been a suggestion that the artifacts should also be set and hidden at random like the major and minor secrets. A slight design change that includes a randomized board with hidden artifacts would have made this game much better. An optional screw your buddy element would have also made the game more challenging. Games are conflict for a winner, so I do not understand people who do not like games with conflict, but the screw you buddy cards could be optional. Maybe even a RPG element like Talisman to it would make the game go even further.

A fantastical and fantastically fun push-your-luck deck-builder. I usually dislike deck-builders with a rotating market but it's fine here, since individual cards don't seem to dominate and there are other luck-based elements you can hope go your way instead. The board is crucial, adding another dimension and giving the game more strategic scope. The tension of the dragon attacks is delightful and it's great that you can set your level of risk with the cards you buy and the moves you make. It's a real gem.

Great noob-friendly deckbuilder. Having to navigate the board is an interesting twist, and something I really like. I'm glad the board is two-sided for the variability -- you're not able to take the same path every game.

Blends deck building and Dungeon delving seamlessly. I do wish there were more monsters. I like the blue side of the board more. I just like the market being in the middle.

Admittedly, I always go for the thirty point artifact. This is an excellent game, perfect weight and length of play.

I love this game!

I really like deck-building games, but many of them (Dominion for example) can become "solved" for players with more experience. For a given set of available cards the "obvious best strategy" isn't obvious to the newer players and all the fun drains out of the game for everybody.

Clank's has a wider diversity of cards, and their availability throughout the game is random, so you wind up with the field being a bit more level for players of different experience levels.

I have friends that like "Fun" games, and friends that like more technical games, and this seems to satisfy both camps. I've only played Clank! three times, but I fully intend to pick up a copy of this game the second it becomes available.

RATING: 8
A deck building adventure game for 2-4 players. Delve deep into the dragon's lair to try and wind treasure and escape. But every move makes noise and may attract the ire of the dragon. The best treasures are found deeper in the cave, but getting out becomes more difficult.

RATING: 8
Intuitive deck-building and role playing is core to the Clank! experience. Very varied while not being that complex, the game allows players of all levels to identify to the thief they play : one that is not perfect and makes sound as he misses a step or two in the dragon's lair. 
We all hope that the beast doesn't wake up... until it does.

Really good game that I can play with my 8yo kid. I think the combination of deck building with moving on a board is a just awesome. The theme sits at the exact spot on this one. The game is competitive in essence, but there is no action denial per say, as most of the game resolves around observation of what other players do and what cards are being purchased. I also like that you can change your goal as you unveil more cards and grab more equipment. The game rewards you for being flexible rather than trying to fulfill a pre-defined strategy, which is a freedom of play that I really enjoy in a game.

I enjoyed the deckbuilding kind of choices, and the exploration choices; however, this game uses the Ascension conveyor belt of offers, which can easily deliver nothing good for a player turn after turn. The only game I've seen use this conveyor belt and make it work well is Dale of Merchants, which includes price-dropping: New cards cost more than if they sit out there a while. Anyway, net result is that if you never are offered what you need to purchase deck improvements, you never achieve liftoff, and you can't begin to compete with others who do.

Great starter deckbuilder. The dungeon crawl element allows players to feel more immersed in the game instead of just staring at their deck of cards. There are multiple strategies to winning--get a cheap artifact and bounce out? Go for the most expensive artifact and just make it out of the depths? Collect secret tomes? Our scores were 94, 94, 92, and 92-- everyone chose a different tactic and it was still a really tight race.

Almost close to perfection in terms of sheer enjoyment I've had with this game. However, points get docked due to unimpressive meeples and also the fact that most games end before your deck synergy becomes apparent. But I also love the relatively short playing time so it's not too bad. (Avg. game time is 75-90 minutes for my group)

RATING: 5
In my  opinion, the game is enjoyable if played as a family game, but hard gamer should agree that Clank is completely out of control. Random cards available every round, random damage cube drawn from the bag, random Secrets tokens and just disadvantages to begin the game as the last player.
This is not a deckbuilding game, players have almost no control on their decks: you just buy cards that may be useful. There is no way you can build a combo: you have to buy the (at least) two right cards (or buy the first and then pray to see the other one in future rounds) and then hope you’ll draw them together! Yes, hope, because just one or two players will be able to buy something that will allow them to remove cards in their deck (in my opinion, the only thing that allow the perfect deckbuilding).

I really can’t understand those who call Clank “a good deckbuilding game”. This is a good push your luck game, a very good family game, a good game to play in just one hour, not a good deckbuilding game. No way.
If you want to play a good deckbuilding game, try Thunderstone, Rune Age or, at least, Dominion.

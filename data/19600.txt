RATING: 6
Plays quickly for a game of this scale and the mechanisms are slick and fit together nicely. I have concerns that actually there is only 1 strategy to pursue or at least a miltary/expansionist approach is just not viable. More plays will obviously see if this is true or not but if that's the case the long term replayability will diminish rapidly and my rating will reduce. If not true, it will more than likely become an 8

This is one of my favorite games but we don't get it out and play it very often.  The only draw back is when you make several moves it a bit of a pain ot keep track of that has completed it's full movement.  The laying down the units is a great way to help keep track.

The map is great with 2 sides and everything is well made.  Just my cards are messed up due to a cup of water that spilled on them right before my very first game.  But the cards don't get used much and just lay on the table so it not a big deal.

I really like this one, an area control/civilization building game that looks like a wargame but isn't.  There are a lot of routes to victory, which I always like.  There is a slight skewing towards the developments/upgrades and temples being more valuable than the other victory conditions, but I still think it is pretty well balanced.

It was really fun for the first 2/3 and then slowed down considerably. The empire-building is great but the combat left a bit to be desired. I do love the rondel and think it is fun overall... I'd like to try playing with 3 or 4 at most, to see if the game length could be shortened.

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting civilisation game.  The rondel mechanics works very nice. Thanks to it Antike is very dynamic and lasts shorter than similar games. There is a lot of small decisions to be taken during the game. The random element was eliminated thanks to rondel and battles rules based on forces advantages. Game offers pure development of empire touching economic and military aspects.

RATING: 5
I did enjoy the pace of the game (very fast despite of the overall game length). I also the distinct paths to victory and the fact that each of those gets harder and harder to work on. What I dislike are the artworks (a "no buy" for me) which are really up to the level I expect from a boardgame in my collection and I believe from the experience I had that there is a flaw in the gameplay: you need to work on the "knowledge" track early in the game. If you don't, someone may steal the victory from the other players. In addition to that, a late mistake from one player usually lead to the final VP to be gained by someone. All those points are really major issues but it gets games to look very much alike. I believe that Antike doesn't have that much replayability. Still I enjoyed the games I had so I wouldn't turn down a game... Still with a few more plays, I guess I could get bored.

2 plays / 3,5 players

LIKE: simple rules, rondel
DISLIKE: kingmaker. if a couple players are battling back and forth, the third will be left alone to build resources and score. the game is a bit dry, too.
OVERALL: Mildly fun, but I would need many plays to understand how the strategies can unfold without being just a combat/conflict game.

RATING: 6.5
Shares alot in common with Conquest of the Empire. I thought it worked well - the rondel keeps things pretty evenly paced if not frustrating. The early rounds are incredibly brisk, but as the game board matures and everyone closes in, folks tend to turtle up and the game slows to a crawl. Still, if a thumping game is your cup of tea, this might fit the bill quite well.

nice strategy game, area control, conflict. Rondel mechanic. I am not a huge fan of area control games and I do not particularly enjoy this game, but has some nice mechanics that my friends appreciate and like.

RATING: 7
On the postive side, this can be tremendous fun.  There's a lot going on and much to think about.  You can win lots of ways, it's elegant, it's quick, it looks good, the board has two sides, the rules are well written, it can be very edgy.  It's also easy to learn, but not to master.  Further, the roundel is a clever and fun mechanism, whilst the know-hows and simple battle system add much to the game.

On the negative side, the early game and middle game are a LOT more interesting than the end game, which can come out of nowhere and be very short -  things may finish in a flash.
Also, the end is rather a "bash 'em up" feast, and like a lot of such empire games, if you're stuck in the middle it's not so good, especially if you allow the folks in the corners to make non-aggression pacts.  In fact in that respect, this game can be worse than say, SoE, CoE or Vinci.

Despite the negatives, I enjoyed this and am very keen to play again.  I think it's better than Vinci, for instance, and maybe my rating could rise to an 8, though it's limitations will ultimately stop me rating it as a 9 or 10.

A great little civ game, no dice thankfully. The only downside is the VP scoring for seas as they are the only ones which are unbalanced from starting position. 

Also, central map players get hit from all sides too often, civ's in better/worse positions could use some discounts/penalties to balance all players.

Antike is a racing game. If you see it as one, its quite funny and challenging. Its defenitly played better with more than less players. Great kings (1 for each 5 cities) are way too often gained if playing with too few players. Military is tempting but only worth if captured a temple or to cripple your opponents ressources. In the last case he can always expand in another direction and your efforts are mostly senseless. If you look for a fast playing easy to teach racing game, Antike is probably worth it, but has too many games which are similar in play-style but better.

On first sight civ reincarnated. This to me is not a bad thing. It is however much quicker and simpler game. The turn mechanism is original and requires planning as to what you can do each round. Whilst there is the usual conquer land strategy this is unlikely to win as the variety of ways to earn victory points will provide a winner before you can earn enough points. Lots of strategies. Excellent game.

An interesting light Civ-wargame that trys to blend the 2 aspect into a simple game.

Playing with a full compliment of 6 gamers did not slow the game much at all. Down time is less than 5mins. 

Lots of table talk that's great for negotiation for a greater cause. 

Leaders will certainly be targeted in the final rounds much like other games. But it's not always true. Other gamers might be able to still a win from behind in 1 move. 

Overall a light wargame that's good for introduction to area control wargames to newbies.

RATING: 8
I'm extremely disappointed that Rio Grande didn't add a nice plastic insert to organize the "over 400 wooden pieces" (I didn't count, but that was the marketing copy on the box). I mean, the game was around $65 CDN! I was crazy to purchase it at this store that I know has a high markup, knowing that I could get it for cheaper online. Argh, I am now kicking myself relentlessly. I don't know why all of a sudden I'm become so superficial in my demands for pretty plastic inserts in my game boxes.  But it's a real downer for me to see a mess of pieces all jumbled together. Must be something psychological or something, this desire to organize all the game pieces into nice little compartments...
UPDATE 1: Finally got a chance to play Antike with 4 players. What Antike lacks in game box organization, it definitely makes up for it in board game design - all the important information is displayed on the board, player cards, and player aids. Once we got the game rolling, it was easy to figure out what actions can be taken. Also, I'm starting to get more comfortable with war-like games (such as Shogun). Although I played this one overly passive, I'm starting to recognize that timing is an important factor when attacking another player - I still have to work out that part, but I do realize that I started attacking too late in my first game of Antike. Something to work on! UPDATE 2: Antike has become one of my favorite 5-6 player war-like games, up there with Shogun. It is a solid game with plenty of player interaction and just enough euro-mechanics to keep me interested. With 6 gamers and 4+ hours, I'll be voting for Antike or Shogun on game night.

Civilization 'lite'. The Grail quest for many gamers and it almost lives up to the hope. Only an end game that has always relied on military build up lowers my opinion of my first "rondel" game.

RATING: 8
The 'great people' serving as VP for your budding civilization is a nice, thematic implementation of what are little more than victory points. The rondel actions are good and offer interesting decisions every turn. The techs are unfortunately very limited, but they are all worthwhile and still add a lot to the game. 

The no luck combat is cool, but makes me a nervous wreck. The board state feels ever so fragile every turn. 

Overall, I wish there was a little bit 'more' in the sense of building up your civ--but Antike is a very good game.

RATING: 7.5
Based upon 2 plays, the second of which I won.  The rondel is a nice touch but ultimately both games were won through a zerg tactic which the other players could do little to prevent.  In the game I won I gained 5 VPs to go from last to first by arming and creating 21 army units/boats and then basically blasting three temples and also gaining 1 point for having 7 boats in different terratories and increasing my city count to 10 from 7.

Needless to say this didn't exactly endear that game to the other players.

First Impressions: A good area control/empire building game. There are 3 different resources to gather. Luck is non existant as expected in a Mac Gerdt's game. I like the theme of this game a bit more than the theme of Imperial. The mechanics are quite the same. There are several scoring categories so each player can focus on some or try to do a little bit of everything. I like the fact that you can make long term strategy plans.

Deceptively unlike other civ games I've played, which may explain some of the negative ratings. The rondel works very nicely, and the limited supply of civ advances and temples prevent players in "buildup" mode from being isolated from their neighbors' actions. The combat system is not broken as long as you take it into account in your planning: you're not going to be able to build a huge army and sweep across the world with it. Very satisfying to play; I'm looking forward to having another go.

Very disappointed with this one as I was expecting good things. I found it tedious and repetitive and lost interest quickly, a bit too much like Risk (which I really hate) but without the massive luck factor there. The turn movement system is clunky, the technology system is very basic and with 5 players the board (where I was anyway) was very cluttered. I am not saying it is a bad game, just I did not enjoy it.

Antike certainly deserves some attention as a civilization building game with decent spatial, wargaming, and "get the rewards early and strategically" elements.  

Antike feels as if it is somewhat related to Eclipse.  If you like Eclipse, you should probably play its predecessor, Antike, at least once.  Similar in some respects?  Totally different?  Of course, Eclipse, lacks a rondelle (thankfully), but how about the occupation of resource specific planet/countries, building resource engines through the occupation of those planet/countries, and pursuing varied goals while keeping an eye on conquering things?  Have some fun playing both...then you decide.

PROS:
*) Fast moving. I believe this is the first Civ-themed game where I asked "what, my turn already?", and meant it.
*) A sense of empire building (which I'm personally rather fond of)
*) Clever rondel mechanic
*) Over the course of a game, you can make lots of small, but interesting decisions
*) It takes careful planning to be the first to reach the required number of victory points without the other players knowing what hit 'em (otherwise you run in danger of facing several hostile players).
*) Rules are pretty clear and straightforward
*) Components are nice and of good quality (and they include extra zip bags!)

CONS
*) Not sure about that one, yet, but the start of the game might turn out to be pretty mechanic as players get more experience (a little like opening moves in chess, but with less options)
*) A single try with three players reveals that - with three players - the game might turn into an army buildup race, with no-one daring to openly attack, because they fear the 3rd player.

it has the makings of a solid game, but it's euro-sterile.  i love the wheel.  my biggest problem is that the endgame stuff can be delayed for so long, everybody working against the obvious leader with their obvious goals.  it can take forever to push through a wall with it.  the first 2/3rds of it aren't bad though, and i'm still kind of curious about how it would play with 6 instead of 4-5.

This is the first world domination game I've played that I've enjoyed.  I think the aspect I most enjoyed was that you really have to have a well rounded focus to do well.  You can't concentrate just on building up your army and destroying your neighbors, but you can earn points for knowledge, cities, and temples as well.  It moves pretty fast, unless someone is making a big troop maneuver.  AP can bring the game to a halt here.  However, I do appreciate that there's no player elimination and it is possible to pull yourself back into the game.  I'll happily play this one again.

This game plays with a feeling like a race.  Players scramble to claim lands and get the resources built up in orer to fuel the next steps.  If you get bogged down in combat, you'll fall behind.  If you are efficient and maintain a good pace, you'll come out on top.  The game play is solid and can be quick if the players do not get locked into analysis paralysis.  Combat is not forgiving and if you are involved, your best chances of survival in the game are to bring others in (down?) with you.  It is important to watch for opportunities to claim personages when possible.  Don't underestimate the value of the personages claimed through advancements.  These are much simplier to get then generals or even some building goals.  Play balance is entirely dependent on player balance.  [GTI: TGSD]

Fantastic game for my taste.

While I also like Mare Nostrum a lot too, this one is far easier to get people to play, and is less vulnerable to dragging on (which great balance can cause), as this game is as well balanced as Mare Nostrum.

Scanning some reviews from my 'analyze' and other respected reviewers, our one house rule seems to address the all the negatives I've read (that matter to my taste) at a fundamental level.  We shrink the board with low player counts.  We place grey or black player disks, not used by any player, on territories to make them out-of-play.  So the space is smaller.  This raises the interaction level, which underlies the main reviewer negatives against it.  So turtling, lack of vulnerable temple production, etc, all becomes not viable with high and early interaction. Also, the game is not really 'solvable' when interaction interrupts the 'solution'.

The flipside of this is 'be wary of 3 player games on a full board'.  The game totally breaks down in this case on several fronts, as other reviewers point out.  It is both transparent and drags on in this configuration.

More good news is that a 2 player variant works exceptionally well, as you'd expect from a relatively straight and abstract wargame...just constrain to a very small map.

Have tried this once - a small 3 player game, but the rating could certainly go up from here. 

Very nice smooth civ game - this is basically what I want out of a "Civilization" board game... ease of play, nice components.

What's even better is that I can bring it to the table for Eurogamer friends and they won't be offended. It's really something that everyone can enjoy.

------------

After a second try with a few more people, it seemed to drag a little bit. I can't confidently say that this was a result of having 5 people, or if it was just that everyone was actually in the mood for BSG instead of a strategy game.

--------

The more I play this game, the more it becomes a staple. It's extremely simple so can be explained in as little as five minutes. Meanwhile, it easily fills multiple niches: civ building, combat, negotiation, saber rattling, at a VARIOUS number of players. With so little downtime, it's as good at 3 as it is at 6. 

After much much deliberation, I'm upgrading this to the hall of heroes: It's a 10.

RATING: 7.8
Feels quite different from his other rondel games which I've played, but surprisingly good - a deserved classic. Much less direct conflict than expected, but interesting trade-offs for it, with temples increasing your productivity but also painting a big target on yourself. Can involve a lot of careful jockeying for position, and timing things to steal away a last personality before your opponents. Lots of buildup, for a very short endgame.

Excellent! Multiple paths to victory, and not unduly nasty. And I suspect the gold route is much stronger than the military. The threat of conflict is much more concerning than actual battles!  The 2-player variant on BGG works great,  and cuts playing time to <1h.

Played with 5.  Won by second player.  Had the number of turns been equal then I would have reached the victory condition also.  Slightly unsatisfactory that turn order should determine the winner and that there is no compensation for this in the set up.  For example, extra coins for the later players.

The novel feature is the 'rondel', which works well.  The rest of the game I feel as if I have 'done' before.  The turn play is quick, even so our first game took over three hours.  Bookkeeping is simple as there is no loss of VPs gained, which is good.  The game appears to force the requirement to fight for temples near the end of the game, which is just about right. Happy to play again but there are more exciting games around.

Now played with four.  Much better than five, but other three players lost interest as I had a seemingly unassailable lead. Disappointing that the game can be won without a single battle taking place.  Maybe the cards could be scaled down with fewer players.  I want to like this game but it keeps throwing up issues.

Needs at least 4 players to work.  5 is better.  Things tend to drag on in the end-game, esp. with AP players.  6 may be too many.

Nagyjából a többi rondellás színvonalát hozza ez is, szóval aki szereti ezt a típust, annak érdemes kipróbálnia. Itt mindenkinek egy saját ókori nemzete van (2 személyesnél 2), amelyekkel fejlődni, építeni, de legfőképp harcolni kell. A tábla két oldala nemcsak nyelvében tér el egymástól, hanem teljesen más a térkép is. A kivitelezés szép (nem értem azokat, akik szerint csúnya, bár lehet, hogy az egy másik kiadás). Több stratégia van, de a végén szerintem nem lehet elkerülni a harcot. Vigyázni kell arra, hogy ne túl későn kezdjük el támadni a riválisokat. Mivel a megszerzett személyiségeket nem lehet elveszíteni, egy ponton túl már lehetetlen meggátolni az élen állót. Szerencsefaktor legfeljebb a nemzetek kiosztásánál van.

Kategóriájához képest rövid (másfél órás egy 3 személyes parti), és jó hogy van két térkép. Visszakozok, esetenként mégis vissza lehet hozni a vesztett partit is.

A civ-lite game, Antike includes three resources, two types of units, temple building, rondel-style decision-making and a light tech tree.

An excellent minimalistic light civ with several balanced paths to victory and elegant mechanics. Similar to other Gerdts games (e.g. Rondel), yet unique. I'd wish for the very well designed vp cards to offer an extra characteristic as well, so the player could draft an ability while getting a vp. Then I'd rate close to 10. Still an excellent 2h game that plays fast and easy with many balanced choices.

RATING: 7
This is without doubt a game by Mac Gerdts, the rondel being his trademark! It's quite an easy game to catch (specially if one is playing this AFTER Imperial...), but has some subtleties. I am not particularly fond of this type of games, based on an equilibrium between the strenghts of the positions (because one weak player tends to unbalance the game), but the ease of play and straightforward rules made me like this one. It seems Mac Gerdts should find a place among my favorite designers...

RATING: 8
Picked this offering up with Christmas money.  I wanted to get a civ game that could access 2-6 players and not take all day to play (ala Civilization or Advanced Civilization).  Antike seemed like a possibility.  I really like the rondell and winning by "earning" notable characters. After playing two 2 player games, I really don't want to go down that road anymore.  It's too easy when playing two different empires to ignore the one with the other.  I am more interested in seeing how things will play out with 4-6 players duking it out.  Will more diplomacy be evident?  Will backstabbing come into play?  I will undoubtedly update my ranking after a few more plays.  The game is definitely enticing, but would probably pass on future two player options.  [Gift]
Update:  Increased score after playing with six players.  Much more enjoyable.  Will probably not play with less than 4 or 5 players in the future.

[i]Posted: 12/22/06, Rated: 9[/i]

Ah, honeymoons.  They are wondrous, anxious, and exciting.  Such is my response after my first few plays of [i]Antike[/i].  But before I wax on about this game, let me tell you a little bit about myself.

I love turn-based, 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) games for the PC.  I've logged weeks' worth of time with such titles as [i]Master of Orion[/i], [i]Master of Magic[/i], and of course the [i]Sid Meier's Civilization[/i] series.  The complexity of that genre doesn't translate well to a board game: a lot of the "bookkeeping" can get overwhelming if you don't have a computer crunching all of the numbers behind the scenes.  Trying to approximate a computer's behavior at the gaming table takes up a lot of time, and usually a ton of fiddly rules.

[i]Antike[/i] is the long-awaited exception that proves the rule.  It is so incredibly streamlined, that it captures the essence of a 4X PC game without inflicting horrendous calculations or player down-time.

The much-discussed [i]rondel[/i] is the engine at the heart of this game.  Simply put, it shows the eight available actions.  In a fit of elegance, each player can move up to three spaces clockwise around the rondel for free each turn.  She can choose to go further, but she must pay resources to do so.  This balance between resources and actions is exquisite.  The rondel develops a personality of its own.  You can envision the epochs of your civilization as they pass.  Certain periods are flush for resources (Iron and Gold, which are close to each other), while others are more militant (Maneuver and Arming).  Gauging your opponent's position within the rondel cycle is also important.  Did he just pass "Arming?"  If so, then he is ripe for an attack!

There is no random element to this game, which is highly attractive to me.  The outcome of a battle is perfectly predictable; there are no dice involved.  The simplicity of the mechanics permits players to focus on strategy and diplomacy.  This game can be highly social, and an astute player will avail herself of those options.  Each side is identical in its abilities, which is a slight drawback.  I would have liked to see advanced options that give each civilization its own unique "flavor," perhaps in the form of a starting technology, an extra resource, or a military unit.

I'm infatuated with [i]Antike[/i] at the moment.  Its weight scales well with players of varying levels of interest or skill.  I think it is a great way to introduce new players to civilization-building games, and therefore it is a welcome addition to my collection.

First time was solo play (4-player - greeks,romans,germanic,phonecian). Romans got completely crushed - phonecians completely ate everyone alive after keeping close to it's own territory and building gobs of temples - THEN they went exploring. Germanics where roaming everywhere north and just got spread too thin, and the greeks, well they were squashed between the romans and phonecians. I intentionally placed each group from a different mindset just to learn variances in strategy. Need to play with real opponents! Like the Rondel - makes you think turns in advance as to what resources to gather before committing to acquisitions or movement.
Have played it multiple times since - 3,4,5 player combinations. A variety of strategies encountered. Yeah, as commented elsewhere you can see where temple destruction is the point generator du jour.

The first (but not the best) rondel game. The mechanics are good and playing is smooth with all players counts.
It has a bit of conquer, resource management, civilization.
A good game if you need a game for large groups (up to 6 players) and a short play time.
The game got quite overshadowed by its author's masterpieces (Imperial, Navegador, Concordia)

Light Civilization game. It works well with 5 or 6 players. It is very difficult to attack and destroy an opponent, so it is a race in scoring more vp as possible with the better resources / actions management.

This was a present to me for Christmas 2009.

I must say that I enjoyed my first play of Antike. It offers lots of choices and getting a roll-on seems to be quite difficult. It seems to be a game that tries to get each player into a balanced mindset. Certainly one I want to play again.

This scratches that Risk itch for me. I don't think I like it as much as I thougt I would. But I still like it well enough and find it fun when played with 4 or more. I love the rondel (jackson!) mechanic. Keeps things moving fast. I don't think I can play this without trying to be the baddest mofo (militarily that is) on the board. It's just no fun to take a merchant-like building approach and get your ass kicked! For me it's all about sacking YOUR temples.

Wonderful game, the rondel system works very well, is very elegantly set up.  The military mechanics of taking a city are a bit quirky, but interesting.  Keeping new players on track with earning victory points is something to watch for and help with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played Antike now about 10 times and only won a single game. What I like about the game is that it is rather quick to play, when all players know what to do. The tension around the game table is excellent, when all players have about enough points to go for the final strike, so one never should ignore what the other players have in front of them and what they might plan for their next move. It seems to be easily possible to gain 2-3 victory points in the last move, if carefully planned.
Only downside of this game is that there isn't so much interaction during the game. All players play more or less for themselves with the exception of making an alliance here and there, or threatening another player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A pseudo civilization, strategical, no luck game where the rondel actions presents tense and difficult decisions.

There are multiple paths to victory and smart gameplay to be done. The game has an epic civilization feel to it while still maintaining a quick pace.

It has the look and feel of a classic and plays that way. The two player version, Antike Duellem, is also highly recommended if you enjoy this one.

RATING: 8
This fits my requirements for a perfect "short" civ game.  You build up your nation in size, strenght AND technology.  Fighting is quick and decisive.  Goals are clear cut in the form of victory conditions.  My one complaint was that in our 6-player game, the VP options got pretty scarce at the end.

Update:  Raised my rating.  In games with less players, the victory points seem a little less scarce.  Also, once you have the experience going in knowing that they CAN and DO run out, you are better prepared.  In fact, we've decided we're not going to play with the new English-version rule where you can get a bonus VP from getting all 8 techs, because we think it takes too much battling out of the game.  Destroying temples for VP is a much more exciting way to end the game (IMHO).

Update 2: lowered my rating back down.  After playing through a few games, the strategy doesn't vary as much as I'd like.


This is probably a 9, but it just isn't made for two which is my main player count, so thus the 8.

I don't like troops and fighting, but the battle aspect here is so abstract that it's really more akin to straight-up area control and I really enjoy it. There are different strategies you can try each time, based on your starting position. I've only ever played with 4, which seems like the perfect balance between forced conflict and the ability to do your own thing for a while. I would like to play with 3 or 5 sometime. 6 seems like it would be crazy, and 2 seems like it might be kinda boring.

It seems that combat is a bit too euro (1:1, with no luck), but it makes perfect sense. This is a game of logistics, not combat: any luck would turn it into a completely different game.

I think it's a pretty good game. Has a nice build-up of tension throughout the match, but it seems like a game that doesn't have all that much variety (maybe 10 to 20 plays could make one sick of it).

Sadly, Imperial makes the coolest thing about this game, the rondel, lose its main appeal here. This would be a solid 8 without the release of Imperial, I think.

Rondel based game where colonisation/conquest allows you to collect kings, scholars, generals, navigators and the like who can get you other rewards.

This is a great Mac Gerdts game, but it suffers from metagaming too much.  Going for gold production and the Scholars can be a lock unless there is competition.  All the other Personages require your neighbors to all play nice.  If one player decides he's going for Kings, you better hope he is on the other side of the map.  he won't win and he'll take you down with him.  I think going for the defense tech is very important.

I can't wait to try this again.  My rating might go up if I got to see it play with more and different people.

Great fun game that scratches lightly at the itch of Civilization. The turns come around very fast which really eliminiates downtime.

I like 'civilisation' type games, so that helps - but overall I'm not so impressed. Like many multiplayer games with combat it helps if you can stay out of combat, and being on a board edge rather than squashed between others helps. End game is a bit disappointing, which is the main complaint I have - I enjoy playing until the end and then it all feels a bit flat. I like the rondell, but I think Imperial is a better game for that mechanic. For civilisation style games I'd much rather play either original Civ if I had the time or Mare Nostrum with the Mythology expansion. 

Update. Played again after a while and like it less than I remembered :( Definitely doesn't work with 5, and the English side of the map is much less interesting. Overall - I'd much rather play Mare Nostrum for the type of game, or Imperial for the Rondel mechanism.

Update: traded.

A easy little Civ-like game with a touch of historical appeal and some very simple combat mechanics.

I liked this game on the first play.  On the second play I was left with a: "so thats all there is?..." feeling.  

I want to like this game, because I love Civ.  After multiple plays, it just seems that all the stuff that I do love about games is missing.  I do think though that there could be potential for it.  (maybe some defensive bonuses when "gang-up" tactics come into play, I don't know, maybe some events(calamaties) that could hit various countries once they are of a certain size)  

All this being said, on the third play I decided I won't play this game unless 2-3 other people are wanting to play it.  I would rather play a 2 hour civ game cut short etc.

It might have been a groupthink, but I don't think anyone had been playing illogically.

2-6 | (5) | 120 min | 12+ | Mac Gerdts
Antike looked like a promising game, but in the end it did not live up to my expectations. The first half is a sort of cold war, in which players race to gather resources. Once there is no room for further expansion, hostilities break out, but your best shot at winning is to actually avoid the fighting and then exploiting weakened players. The last few turns are very prone to AP, and the side who avoids fighting (usually a player on one end of the map) is usually in a very strong position. Also, advancing additional spaces on the rondel seemed easier than in other rondel games. In my opinion, Imperial and Navegador are far better game designs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice to have some confrontation as a contrast to other eurogames. A lot of building up before it gets to that stage though. Mechanics are simple yet provides lots of depth for play.

Update Jan 2011: 8.0 -> 7.5.  
After not playing it for 3 years, we revisited. It's not as good as Navegador. What we did like was the fast playing time. 1.5 hours. What we didn't like was the fact that 3 players finished their 9 VPs all in the same round and Player One is the winner by the randomness of being Player One and not being equal turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting game. My initial view is that Antike is better with 4 or more players - there is more interaction. Nice components, fairly innovative mechanics and fast to play.

I'll give 7 after 1 play but we'll see how rating developes after a couple of more plays.

EDIT:

Rating goes down. I would really like some sort of random element in fighting (which I find a bit disturbing since I typically like open information) which would increase tension in the game.

9/6/06 - from the initial game of 5 I am hooked. The game, by time standards, took a little over 3 hours to play but felt like 2 or 3 minutes. Great balance in the game in terms of how to achieve the ancient personages to win. You could conquer land coupled with the building of temples. You could focus on knowledge. You could control the waters. You could just go around destroying temples. In the first game played for whatever reason I focused on building an army to gain and control land. Then I just sat on 10 regions and built up my economy to build temples for the win. Actually the win came by destroying my neighbours temple to give me another general. This game not only allows for deep strategic and tactical play but it is fun!

I've only played this game about 6 times.  The game has an interesting mechanic.  It uses a rondel to choose what you can accomplish on a turn.  The rondel is like a spinner without a spinning arrow.  Instead you move a marker up to three spaces ahead, and everyone has their own marker.  This game has no "luck" element.  Not a single thing is dictated by chance.  It reminds me of chess in that manner.  And if you choose to be aggressive and war like in the game, you are guaranteed to lose unless every other player is also doing the same.  This game really penalizes the aggressive player.  I like the luck factor in games, so I don't particularily enjoy this game.

RATING: 6
Opinion after one play with 6 players on the English map: decent abstract empire building game, but nothing special.  The rondel is a very cool mechanism, but that was about the only thing that impressed me.  I don't like that the temples both triple production for the region and add three defense -- makes them a no-brainer choice to build.  I much prefer systems where you have to carefully balance between increasing your production capacity and increasing your military strength.  The "no random elements" combat system is OK, but degenerates the game into picking very small battles and then having to convince everyone else not to take advantage of the fact that you are weakened.  Too much diplomacy for my taste.

RATING: 8
Civ-lite - Empire-building lite - Turns fly by, one of my main reasons for liking this game so much.  Simple resource, purchasing mechanics.  One action per turn, limited by rondle, but not really!  You can do anything if you are willing to pay.  Double-sided board adds to replay value, starting areas give historical flavor.  A bit too easy to defend, and this gets worse as the game goes on... better to attack early.  Show me a game of this weight for six players that moves this quickly, with as little down time.  I don't think you can.  Instant purchase, and picked up Imperial while I was at it.

RATING: 6
... meh. I'm still unsure about this game. I have yet to play it with the right group (ie cutthroat). One problem that I can't see getting away from is the extremely quick turn orders, especially for a group of players who have played a few times. The last time I played there were numerous comments of "my turn already?". I suppose this can be a good thing, but when all you do on a turn is collect some resources it can get boring. I was the moderator during our last game (not that the game requires a moderator). I spent more than 50% of the time passing out coins and alerting people that it was their turn again. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The first 50% of the game is peaceful expansion with a hope to grab early victory points by advancing your know how. The next 25% is running your economic engine game to crank up a war machine for the last 25%, which is about conquest. On the whole, I like the mechanics of the game, which can be summed up as follows. If you want to hurry up and use what you're getting right now, it will cost you a little extra to do so. But if you want to plod along more slowly, you can do so at lower cost, but you will miss out on good opportunities. That said, it's [i]very[/i] important, especially early on, to go for gold to get as many know how victory cards as possible. Failure to do so will leave you with a large thriving empire, but few victory points for innovation. I thought this was somewhat against the theme of the game. I also question the idea that land troops should be able to attack ships and vice versa. But those are necessary abstractions for playability. That said, I really like that the turns are very fast, and it's relatively easy to plan ahead for what you want to accomplish.

We played 3 players. With 3, this game is clearly broken; the victory conditions are going to take hours and hours and hours to reach. It may be less dysfunctional at other numbers, but overall, nothing in there made me feel like this warrented another play. This felt like Risk with a gratuitous economic engine bolted on, and with the risk taken out. Taking the risk out of Risk does not, to me, sound like a great plan.

I'm really not sure how to rate this one.  I loved the first 3/4 of the game with all of the different ways to score, but the endgame seems problematic to me.  Toward the end of the game, most on the non-conflict oriented points have been scored, meaning it's time for everyone to butt heads.  However, by this point in the game everyone has pretty powerful nations capable of amassing huge armies.  This just results in an arms race where nobody wants to be the first to attack.  I'd love to play it again to see whether people would go for those military points earlier in the game, reducing the need for them toward the end, but for now, this looks to be a huge problem.  I rate the first 3/4 of the game an 8, and the last 1/4 a 2.

RATING: 3
[19/1/06] Upon reviewing the below and duly considering my feelings for this game, I must say I was way too generous in my earlier rating (5.5). After all, I'd choose Eggert Spiele's Global Powers any day over this - not that I like that design either...
----
This game has recently become quite a favourite of some of my gaming friends. Thus, I was eager to try it out and expectations were correspondingly high. I'm saddened to say those were disappointed. 

I feel there's too great a rich-get-richer problem. And the starting positions at the centre seem to be at a disadvantage compared to those located on the periphery. 

Also, the turn mode just doesn't seem exciting enough. And the attritional nature of combat often will only lead to a third party being the winner of any conflict.

I can't help thinking Mare Nostrum is a better game. Particularly with the new rules which adress the issues the rules had as published.

That said, its shortish playing time is a redeeming factor. Yet probably not enough to make me want to play this one.

Looking beyond the game mechanics, the game is for my taste also too generic in terms of its theme. The geography is uniformly bland - particularly due to the even and unhistorical distribution of resources. A little variety (wealthy and poor regions, uneven resource distribution) etc would have IMO been instrumental in balancing positions and making matters a whole lot more thematic and interesting in terms of gameplay. IMO the designer erred on the wrong side of abstraction when he could have easily avoided doing so without complicating the rules in any manner.

As things stand, the game is hardly evocative of antiquity and the game might have just as easily be about intergalactic civilizations...

Very nice game with all sorts of options to consider. Temples seem very strong but if someone knocks them down then you'll be giving somebody a general - Can be very cruel if you adopt the wrong tactic for the position you are in. Clever system of chooing what action you get to do.

Mechanically broken.  Seriously.  I don't understand how this is rated in the top 100.  Unless all but 1 person at the table is mentally retarded, you will end up in a situation where somebody is 1 point away from winning and has to destroy a temple to win.  The game then slows down to a dull crawl as everybody either wants the game to end and lets the person win, or stop him in the hopes of getting one point as well. Wow, how boring.  Play Imperial instead.  You'll thank me for it.

Good game. Rondel is a fantastic feature. Deterministic nature (ie no dice) is both its strength, and it;s weakness, as you tend to stare at the board calculating all teh mathematical possibilities and *can* forget to have fun if you take the game too seriously. I have only ever played this game with 3 players. I am pretty sure I would rate this game higher if I played regularly with 5 players, as this would break down the "the two players who attack each other lose, while the one in the corner minding his own business wins" factor.

As far as these types of games go, its pretty decent.  I was stuck in the middle (6 player game) and it was still a good time though I never felt like I was every going win.  The Rondel is neat in how it limits your actions.  Its possible that it was the people we played with, but I definately felt that 'he who attacks/gets attacked first can't win' syndrome might very well be present here.

The first thing everyone in my group noticed about this game was how the legions look like H&G meeples, the ships look seafarerlike, and the discs are reminiscent of Vinci.  I honestly had trouble taking the legions seriously when they had the cute little outstretched arms.

To get into comments that are *relevant* to gameplay, I generally don't play area control games too often.  Once we got over some rules bumps (we had a not-so-smooth translation, and nobody had played it recently), it ran pretty smoothly and played in a pretty intuitive way.  However, I think I prefer Vinci in a game of this type, as you're not stuck with one civilization for the whole game.  In Antike, if you get attacked or somehow boxed in early on, or you're in one corner and can't attack the game leader, you're sort of stuck there.  (This is my problem with civilization games in general.)

Probably the best Civilization-light game around. Different than Mare Nostrum and in a way a bit more balanced. Playing the Romans and Greeks is hardest because of the central position on the map.

A fun and fast-paced multiplayer war/civilisation game. Everyone I have played with so far has enjoyed it. No downtime because of the rondel mechanic. It is difficult to stop a player that is winning. The game has the classic problem of war costing both the attacker and the defender a lot, which hands advantage to the other players. It captures the feel of civilisation games well in a short play time. 

Update: [thing=24181]Imperial[/thing] is better as are several other similar multiplayer wargames, which makes this unlikely to see play again. I'd be interested in trying Antike II.

I find this game . . . frustrating.  

It seems to offer multiple paths to victory, yet most games come down to a single military thrust to destroy a temple.  This is despite the fact that military campaigning is *not* a viable path to victory given how the system punishes the attacker.

Antike challenges players who begin in central board positions, bearing in mind that futility is challenging.  I have never seen the Greeks or Romans win.  I have rarely seen the Phoenicians loose.

Antike gives you a taste of empire building, but the favor is vanilla as your people have no attributes, skills, or even geographical advantages over others.

It uses an innovative and interesting mechanic in the Rondel, but the mechanic gets tiresome as does the feeling of never having the option to do what you actually want.  There's no logical reason that actions on the rondel can't be done in any order you choose except the game's rules - isn't that the definition of a "gamy" rule?

It's a pleasant way to spend a couple hours building, planning, nurturing; that usually ends suddenly in a single turn's ahistoric blitzkrieg.

It's a game I wanted to love but couldn't and each session lowered its rating.

Now I doubt we'll ever play again.

If you're looking for the perfect civilization building game, I'm truly sorry to say - it still hasn't been made.

RATING: 6
The rondel provides a similar feel to Imperial where getting the pulse of the game - and the quickening of that pulse - is the heart of things. But unlike Imperial which has a shareholding aspect that allows the incentives and alliances to continue to morph and flux through the endgame, Antike is very constrained by the players-as-powers. It has a similar self-balancing to Diplomacy and has all that game's perceptional battle. That is, how do you keep your neighbors more interested in their other neighbors than in you. Also, the very coarse scoring makes for some serious blocking which, for some might be interesting, but I found excessively capricious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Ultimately the game seems to depend more on manipulation of the perception of your opponents than the actual game mechanics -- which is a good and fairly subtle thing.  I'd rate it higher if I were not fairly burnt out on it; we played a lot for a while.

Be not afraid of spending resources for beneficial actions.  It is usually worth it, especially in the early game.  For instance, what is the absolute minimum number of actions required to build three temples?  How about 6 temples?  Now for 5 cities? 10? 15?  What about the technologies?  Now which specific sequence of actions is optimal for earning VPs?  Is it single-target or mixed-model?  Is there more than one path?  The answers may surprise you.

Update: Too transparent and thus easily calculated to be sustainably interesting.

Got this to satisfy my "civ-lite" craving, and it didn't disappoint.  Nice components, with a two-sided board as a bonus.  Game moves quickly, and there are many paths to victory.  Don't expect a war game though, as combat is luckless and expensive.  Looking forward to many more plays.

Initial impression very, very good.  The search for a civ-light game is over, in my opinion.  Abstracts away the correct elements, while retaining those that give the feel of building civilizations.

I was looking for a civ-lite game and I found it in this game.  Victory conditions are easy toi explain and the rondel seems to minimize the AP that games liket his can suffer.

The only draw back is explaining the conquering of a city.  I can wrap my mind around it but have a difficult time explaining it to others.  As always, the 6-player possibility is a bonus for me.  A 2-sided board is also a nice feature that allows twice as much replayability.

Haven't played enough to be sure.

RATING: 7.5
The rules are simple, with an incredibly clear and well-written rulebook. The components and presentation are very attractive and high quality. But does it succeed as a playable (short) light civilization-building game?  Perhaps the civilization building is a little abstract and a bit limited, but there are lots of intersting decisions to make. You're racing to get VPs, really, which are a finite commodity. There is no luck, which is also nice in a game like this.I particularly like the action wheel mechanic. You can take some actions, but others will cost you money to advance that far. The turns are subsequently very short (as you're only doing one action) and it cycles around quickly. Downtime is at a minimum, and is painless.There is also wide open room for negotiation. Everyone can see who has which VPs. If someone starts to draw ahead, or expand too aggressively....the others will unite to keep him in check. This effect has pluses and minuses. This aspect reminded me most of Vinci. But different than Vinci, there are so many turns that it doesn't feel random who "happens" to go over the VP limit on their turn. Here, it seems like a good player can position him/herself for the win by having multiple options for that last VP. Flexibility and good planning will win....unless your diplomacy is a liability.  A very satisfying game.

RATING: 4
I love the Rondel, who doesn't love it though? If there's one common theme in the reviews that I've seen, it is that everyone who has been within 5 paces of this game has instantly fallen in love with that thing.

So what about the rest of the game? For the genre, not bad at all. Fans of this type of game will likely love it. I'm not a fan of this type of game in general though. Antike is a light "build up an economic engine and/or army and then compete with players at the end" kind of affair, and it reminds me a lot of Tempus, albeit in a slightly gamier disguise. In Antike, there are 3 resources that one collects, and there are a few ways to increase your production capacity in those resources. Said resources can later be spent on various victory point mechanisms, some of which make your army better (which allows you to conquer certain areas for VP's), some of which give you technology (which is instant VPs if you are first in), and some of which let you build temples (which create more resources and can also potentially give you VPs). As I said, the overall flow of the game seems to be that players build up their areas a bit in the early going, then they build up a few units, and by the late game, players need to compete directly to get the last piece of the puzzle.

I give plusses to this game based on the generally rock solid pace, which is a huge boon in this genre, I give it negatives because it really does feel a lot like a Tempus type of game, where I strongly feel that nearly the entire game is about building up stuff earlier, and then everything simply is decided by the last frame or two, and that being off in a corner somewhere is generally an advantage. This isn't a Wallenstein corner level advantage, but it is still nice, and certainly benefits a person in that position. Really, the reason why this is a shade below average, and why I may be slightly overrating Tempus yet, is the way the combats in these games work really bothers me. Anyone who stays out of combat until it is nearly impossible to be retaliated against is at a huge advantage, because the resources that it takes to create armies is just a huge time sink. This is particularly true here, because the combat is excruciatingly bloody, with perfect 1-1 trades down the line, and no way to mitigate that effect. Hence, I feel that winning this type of game is often more about who started their civ in a region that had the opponent who was content to sit back without making military incursions than it is about simply being the best logistical planner. I do not mind logistics and planning games if they are done right (and tend to favour them actually), and that is really what is at the heart of the Antike system, the problem here is that inefficiencies can occur basically based on the choices of one's opposition, which is fine if the entire table is interfering with each other with approximately equal vehemence, because then everyone is disadvantaged, but any area of the table avoiding that sort of waste, either via agreement or simple placement, should roll over the combat heavy segment portion of the table most of the time.

The bottom line is that this isn't bad for what it is. I don't generally care for combat games, and this is doing well in that I would not mind playing it again, because the overall pace is good and the rondel really is a neat device; but I don't love this game, and I don't think it escapes the general limitations that I perceive in its niche.

This seems to be a great blend of eurogame with warfare. The warfare will usually occur late in the game so it has the associated problems with kingmaking as does any multiplayer wargame. The same can be said for Wallenstein, Vinci and others. However you could cut back on the number of leaders required for victory and thereby changing the game to one of production. Although I can't see that being much fun. As it stands its still a very good game. Not to long either.

Played a few times now. I really like it. It's quite simple, really. I like that they boiled down the economy, the military, the upgrades, into something really streamlined. The rondel thing is a clever way of giving players a set of choices on their turn (instead of doing all of 6 different phases on your turn, you pick 1, but only from a small subset, or pay more to choose from outside that small set, which changes every turn), such that turns go very quickly. Double sided board = nice bonus!

Antike was pointed out to me I think because it was repeatedly mentioned in any list where the infamous and hypothetical 'Civilization Light' game was discussed. At one point I made a note to give it a try during Spiel, and was lucky enough to find it during its 2006-edition. Although I had a few doubts about the viability at three players (which was the number of our test game), I bought a copy, and began to play with other people. After several games (all at different player numbers), the feeling that Antike was not what I had hoped it to be grew ever stronger. It plays fast due to its very business-like mechanics, but at times they are boring and mindless excercises. [i]Oh, is it my turn already?[/i] is not an uncommong exclamation at my table. However, far more problematic turned out to be the realisation that they also turn the game into a barren campaign of ruthless efficiency where the first one to blink loses. Attacks are non-existent in the 3- and 4-player games; and in the 5-player game the attacker becomes a sitting duck for everyone else in the vicinity. The author of the game published a document in which dozens of units are destroyed to sack just one temple—an impressive use of the simple movement and combat rules, granted... But at the same time both civs are completely bereft of cannon fodder and are likely to be overrun in the next few turns. Therefore Antike suffers greatly from the fact that the attacker will not profit from his actions, pushing the game into the territory of trench warfare with a quick and unstoppable jaunt to the finish. Various ideas were offered to remedy the situation. Antike should be played in a much more tactical and less empire-building sense, acquiring VPs whenever the possibility presents itself. But that means that whoever happens to be the most efficient at turning resources into VP wins as there is not a smidgen of luck or uncertainty to take into account. You can let a computer calculate the optimum moves to get your 'economy' up and running as fast as possible, depending on whether you'd like cities, knowledge, or expansion. The variety is completely due to the players interacting with each other, making this title very prone to multiplayer chaos. I dislike such designs, and Antike is no exception.

Another thing which slowly began to work on my nerves is the rondel, Mac Gerdts' token mechanic. He used in every big box game of his (Antike, Imperial, Hamburgum, and hidden away in a horrible map, Princes of Machu Picchu) but he never addressed what I perceive to be its core problem. The rondel works in such a way that the steps you take along its 'track' have a fixed difference. Since Antike is a game of efficiency you will not be wanting to spend a lot of coins moving your pawn further than the standard three paces. But the rondel has been constructed in such a fashion that the pace of your 'engine' is deliberately broken up into inefficient and irritating steps. To me the rondel attains all the characteristics of a stair with steps at an improper height: there is simply no way to walk smoothly across it, always you are forced to break the pace at some point. Of course, were one to introduce a sort-of adaptive rondel, which took care of the problem, then there would need to be other mechanisms in place to reign in a runaway leader. In Antike, those do not exist, save for when the leader is beset upon by all players equally. However, geographical restrictions forbid this already.

Antike began to irritate me more and more, and after nearly three years of not having been out of its box I sold off this example of what happens if you turn players into human computers.

I have cooled on most of the rondel games (Imperial being the one exception), so the rating comes down a bit for this one. I would have liked something a bit less abstract, and a bit less mechanical/procedural. It could be that I simply don't want these games to play too quick, and with too fast and incremental rounds, though.

I love Mac Gerdts games, and this is no different. I need to play this a bit more to do it justice. I felt a little vulnerable playing the phoenicians in my first game.

Nice but not a hit.
Too static. Youb buy armies but it is too expensive to use them. Only the last 10 Minutes (of 2 and a half hours) it comes into action. The board is crowded with troops and ships and you can't see what each country is producing.
Vinci, Serinissima or (the brand new) Byzantium are much better.

RATING: 3
I like this *much* less than its successor Antike II (which is outclassed itself for two players by Antike Duellum). The main reason is that in Antike (I), arming military units for only one iron is waaaay too cheap for my taste. This makes fighting against other players much too attractive in my opinion. Even when an opponent has the know-how for defense +2, you still only need to spend 3 iron to conquer an undefended city - that are only as many resources as founding one! Conquering it comes with the added bonus of substantially harming one of your opponents. Let's not even talk about how overly attractive attacking your opponents is before they develop both defense know-hows (although it is somewhat harder to get to them with the requirement to spend one movement for attacking a city compared to Antike II).
The missing defense bonus with no more than 2 personages and the missing neutral temples are two further disadvantages compared to Antike II, which make conflict more attractive.
Another drawback of Antike (I) is that player order is not balanced (like Antike II does with the Bellona card).
There are even some further details which Antike II improved (particularly being able to choose which resource to produce in cities when founding them and galley symbols in sea regions).

All in all, the old version of the game is just way too conflict oriented for my taste. This would be fine in a 2 party game, but I strongly dislike it in multiparty games. See my 8th general thought about games in my profile.

Antike was only nice insofar as it lead to the much better Antike Duellum and Antike II, but now that they are there, my advice is to stay well clear of the old Antike. Unless you prefer a cutthroat all-out attack fest in multiparty games, of course.

Wonderfully interesting gameplay from a fairly simple ruleset - very elegant. Plays reasonably quickly if people are good about thinking over what they're doing before it's their turn.

On the one hand, there's no random chance, you have full control over your actions, and you can meaningfully make long-term strategic plans. On the other hand, it seems to be very interesting and engaging (due to atmosphere and civ-building nature?) to folks I know who dislike games such as Chess, Go, and other abstract deterministic positionals. Great combination.

I enjoyed very much after one play. Nice epic feel, lack or randomness makes it interesting as well. Resource management and logistics are key to victory. Update 03/08: Finally had the third play, and I won as the Greeks on the Asia map - I am concerned a little for the players that get wedged in the middle, seems like they are always fighting uphill and never have a chance.

Very nice light civilization game with a lot of strategy and short play time(around 2-2:30 hours). I like the Rondel mechanic a lot and it's nice that you can form treaties and pass an area without engaging in combat. It usually is a close game and the tech upgrades really help a lot.

Very good 2 player game also, the only downside being that you play on only half the map and really need to pay attention as to not mistake the borders.

My plays of Antike have left a really sour taste. I'm unsure what purpose the rondel actually serves in this game other than as an artificial action restriction mechanism, as it certainly doesn't have any thematic justification. Meanwhile, the actual play feels dry and pretty rote, without all that many interesting decisions to make. But the most egregious fault is the endgame lockup, as that last victory point is exceedingly difficult to get and becomes even more difficult when everyone catches up and begins vying for it as well. This takes the game from annoyingly long to excruciatingly long.

Played twice, and both times it degenerated into standoff as people struggled to sack that last temple.  The game didn't thrill me generally, and the standoff was offputting.

This ups the conflict and makes for a more satisfying game in my view.

"Freebees"A potentially interesting Waro. Not sure if I like these games that look like wargames, but are just hunts for VP. 
Edit
Second plays drops this to a solid 4.  Too deterministic, lacks tension, seriously lacks fun.  The map layout really determines a lot of your strategy and your at the whims of others. Any player left alone will soon blow others away, so you are forced to fight 1 on 1 all over. Blah blah, just an all around uninspiring game.

Interesting concept, and overall a decent game.  Disappointing, however, in the scripted strategies.  The players seem to race for the Kings until they're all gone, then Scholars, then whatever else they can get at that point.  I would like to see other Key Persons targeted equally (i.e. Navigator).  Hopefully, this isn't the case in all games.  Would like to explore it further with more plays or on the reverse map. Also, I'm not seeing the fascination with the rondel mechanic.

Not my favorite Gerdts game. (That's definitely Navegador, followed by Princes of Machu Picchu.)

Despite Antike having a technology track/tree, a rondel and three different resource types, it feels very much like an abstract. It's all perfect information and map-based tactics.

What it does, it does well enough... it's about a zillion times better than Risk, for example. But it's missing something for me: no map-based tactic mechanic has ever been able to hold my interest all by itself.

The wooden components to this game, it should be said, are very excellent (and very numerous).

I've only played this a handfull of times, but I'm burning for it.  I've got the fever, and the only perscription is more Antike.

Update:  I still love this game.  I like its more generic nature (as opposed to Imperial).  However, I'm the only one in my group that prefers it to Imperial.  That is going to make it tough to get it on the table.

One of the objections raised by its detractors is that the combat feels too disadvantageous.  I'm not convinced that mechinacally this is the case.  I feel that it is more a matter of group think.  More plays will be needed to test my hypothesis, especially w/ 5 or 6 players (that's where I feel combat has the biggest advantage).  If I'm wrong, then I'll need to find a way to make combat better.

Nice ideas. Introduction of Rondel. And I like the economy and tech growth aspects: all simple and fits together well.

But the ending. No fun. All that is left is points from sacking temples so the game turns into a military game. Worse, it turns into one where the entire table discusses how to prevent the active player from winning and then, well, all over again when it's the next player's turn.

So close. But far enough away that I do not expect to ever play again.

After a few plays I have to say that this game is a gem in my collection. It´s not really a civilization game, at it´s heart Antike is a highly competitive resource-management game. 

In all my plays of Antike there has never been the problem of a slow end-game that has been addressed here on the geek by some. I guess, it depends on the people you are playing with. If they can´t see how to get the points they need fast, this problem might occur.

This game has balance issues, because the player starting in the middle of the map has severe disadvantages, since she is attacked from all sides.  But that is the least of the game's problems.  The rondel is innovative, but it doesn't really make any sense thematically. And even more importantly, all the turns seem to be the same: get money, buy more armies, get money, buy more armies.  I prefer to watch the paint dry.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a really nice game. Very simple rules, fast gameplay, little downtime, plenty of meaningful strategic choices.

The only things that keep me from rating this higher are three things, that in my view are design flaws:

1) It seems to be much harder starting on a position in the middle of the board than on the edges (there's no balancing for that).

2) There is a strong chance of people ganging up on the leader... this can go as far as leader elimination (seen it happening). At the end, the player who didn't enter this conflict tends to win. 

3) Kind of an inverse runaway leader problem: Say you loose a region to an opponent's invasion. That will give you less resources to work with which in turn slows you down. At the same time, your opponent gains a region and thus momentum, being able to conquer even more. I found it hard to stop this spiral and have seen it happening multiple times.

It still is lots of fun to play -- I should just really like to see those problems addressed in future editions.

Fun game at start but in the end the only way to score points is to burn temples which leads to an arms race where iron is too important compared to the other commodities. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Rondel does a great job of making a no-randomness wargame feel fun and engaging.  Very stressful to have to plan offensives two or three turns out.  The tech tree does an awesome job of creating a cold war tension.  (If you buy Wheels, there is no more truce line, Mr Germanic Tribe.)  It has to lose a point for being of unbounded time.  A game could last thirteen years in a balanced state since nothing drives the flow towards a conclusion.

And more importantly it loses a point for the "8-tech bonus point".  The rule can be balanced and fair and elegant and whatever, but it enables the game to end on a passive note.  A four hour wargame can't end with an unstoppable sit on your butt and buy a point.  A normal tech victory is fine; you attack their gold producing temple or buy the tech first.  If the game required one less point to win, and then dropped the 8-tech bonus it would be a constant rollercoaster ending on a peak.  Not on a sigh.

Update: 7-3.  I've played enough war and euro-war games now to know that this is complete suck.  You can't blockade a port or raze a city or steal supplies.  These sound like hihg-wargame terms, but really it is just "Why can you still get iron if I have troops standing outside your city?"  Attacking accomplishes nothing unless they have a temple.  Without one, it is just throwing iron chits at each other while the rest of the table runs forward.  This is not a war-euro, it is pure economy.  

If somebody takes the first several turns doing nothing but earning money and building temples, and I do nothing but build ships are rush over to attack him, and I _still_ can't accomplish anything, then there is only one way to play.  Attacking needs to do something to create any tension.

RATING: 7
Players take on one of several ancient civilizations, and expand, build and culture their way to victory.  Turns are super quick - basically advance a dobber on the "roundel" and take the action you land on (take resources, build temples, troops, get smarter, or go conquer stuff).  You earn "historic personages", a nice name for victory points, for achieving goals.  The first half of the game is fun as you grow your empire, then the head butting begins.  The game works very well, and it only takes about 30 seconds to take your turn.  However it can slow down and get a bit stuck late in the proceedings as those last few points are struggled over.  Looks very nice in action.  Rating dropping... getting a bit same-y.

Played it again for the first time in 5 years and really enjoyed it.  So, don't over play it, and it's fine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast, elegant, multiple paths to victory, knowledge advances, it all here. You are all racing to collect three commodities to build troops, tech, and temples. Gain VP's for tech, razing enemy temples, land control, sea control, and building temples. Pretty straightforward good stuff here. 

Note that there is not an iota of hidden information. The late-game war can bog down with negotiators and mini-maxers, so this will determine whether of not this game is a chore. 

Game comes with two maps and lots of wood in the box. Another great fresh game from Eggertspiele. One little extra twist away from being the "grail" everyone is looking for...

Often for the final point or two for the win, you need to pillage a temple. Pillaging can be very expensive if you keep your army forces in high numbers.

I dislike the potential for a player to be squeezed into an unwinnable position, where it is clear that the position is unwinnable, in the early game, primarily by virtue of the initial civilization draw. Perhaps with experienced players this would work better. I'll try this again - but the first play left me underwhelmed.

Second play: Note: this game doesn't work well with players of very different skill levels.

Third play: Yup, not fun for newbs. I wasn't the newb this time, but the newbs didn't like it that much.

Note: Absolutely terrible with more than 4 players.

Great resource management game that lets it all hang out. The answers are all there, no matter what strategy (or strategies) you choose. It can be brutal if you make a false step early, and can lead to rather abrupt endings if you don't closely watch your opponents, but it just makes you want to play again.

Wow!  I've been looking for the Civ-Lite every since I started playing Civ, and while this doesn't reach that idealized state it nonetheless is a very solid title and one of the most played games in our local board game group.

It's strengths include:

Scales well between 3-6, and accomodates six very well, which is a difficult feat to accomplish in a game with so much going on.

Turns are short with very little downtime.  Even with six players your turn can come around sometimes so quickly that you aren't even prepared to take it.  This gives the game a wonderful pace.

The Rondel!  This device is one of the more unique game mechanisms to come out in the last several years.  I hope other games can utilize it's strengths to put out interesting new titles.

In the end, with a large game group, I've shown this game to about 18 people so far and it's always a hit.  No one complains when it's suggested for the table, and people ask for more of it.

A better working game than "Mare Nostrum", but for the price of (even) less historical flair, this is an abstract game of action-resource management that plays astonishingly quick through the use of the ingenious action wheel, which really works well here. This might be a series of battles or a peaceful empire building game, depending on your group's predominant style, but the main reason why this doesn't get a 9 or 10 is the rather dry handling of scientific advances and historical elements. Game material is of high quality and quite abundant, the rules are clear and include tactical tips, but miss out on some key points which most players will grasp intuitively anyway.

A very beautiful game with *lots* of quality bits.  The Rondel mechanic is interesting.  That said, the game offers limited options, forces conflict and has a paucity of commodities.  There is no trading.  Replayablility seems low.  English rules are badly translated, though the examples helped with clarity.  Overall reaction in our gaming group: boring and unsatisfactory.  We all prefer to play Advanced Civilization (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/177), even though it's much longer.  If you're looking for a lighter alternative to Advanced Civilization, I recommend Vinci (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/60) instead.

There's no real mechanism to balance the game other than the players agreeing among themselves not to attack one another and everyone just builds on their own side and see who gets the requisite number of leaders first. Err, if that's the case, why bother making this multiplayer? Might as well play this game solitaire! And there's no catch-up mechanism in resource production. The guy who gets there first will have a huge advantage, regardless.

A "lighter" war/civ type game with a 2 hour time target which is probably more like 3-4 with 5-6 players. Plays well and the action selection mechanism (1-3 free movments around the dial) makes it so you have to plan ahead. That said, there is a good bit of down time.

RATING: 6
A bit hard to get a good grasp on this after one unusual 6-player game, where the Egyptians (me) and the Phoenicians utterly failed to contain the Greeks and let him march to victory with ease, very little war, and certainly no protracted endgame.

It reminded me of Tempus, but I liked it better with its more varied strategy and open-ended length.  Some compare it to Serenissima, which I consider to be a much better game despite its fixed game clock, with more interaction than Antike and a better sense of momentum shifts.

Like everyone else, I like the idea of the rondel, but I'm not sure I like how it's implemented here.  The turn actions are so short that they turn the game into a very choppy affair, and to quote Skyknight X, allow the game to almost move too quickly.  Lack of downtime is fine (although I admittedly am not mortally opposed to downtime), but this might be a cure that ultimately sickens the patient.  The game felt strangled and monotonous at times, as we went around and around the rondel doing very little.

Definitely want to play again, and see if smarter play yields better results.

RATING: 6.7
A good game, for some reason reminds me of risk but a little more strategy and all the randomness taken out. Actually a nice civ type game. Our 5 player game took way too long, kinda stalemated. Other sessions have not been too bad. We play the 2 player variant using only half the board and 1 civilisation each which works okay, the official version requires you to take 2 civs each which is just too much work. We feel the official 2 player rules are a fudge to get it to work with 2 players, try our way its better.

RATING: 9
Good light civilization building game, zero luck, nice mechanisms and ideas, great looking map, quick game-play.  A very clean and neat system that scales well.  

The two player variants described in the rules are inferior, but an excellent one has been proposed by BGG users, see the post here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/352200

Overall: superb.  If there is a weakness, it might be that it is pure strategy and that there are no random events, as one might expect from a civ game.  Strategic play can be trumped by your board position (e.g. if you're sandwiched between two hostile and aggressive players) and diplomacy, so the best player won't necessarily win.  I personally don't mind this, because I love games with diplomacy, but I can appreciate that there are people who don't care for this (if they want the game to be all strategy, and get frustrated that they lose just because other players gang up on them.)  Antike might even be best as a two-player game, because that eliminates the diplomacy and bad board position which some people dislike about it: it's just two players head to head, and diplomacy and board position doesn't really come into it.

One play and I was a bit surprised at how light the game was. I'd play again, but my gut feeling is that there's not enough here to hold my attention. 

I came away with the same feeling which a lot of others have expressed -- build temples in the back of your civ, don't get out in front (which I did) and hang back till the end.  Wish victory conditions were different for each civ or somehow a bit more sophisticated. Little to no interest to explore this one but could be talked into it.

The first of the rondel games.  Very clean mechanics though the warfare is quite simplified and almost formulaic.  I am still deciding about this one.  There seem to be a number different initial strategies for obtaining the ancient personalities (ie the victory points), but often the end, especially with 4 or more players, boils down to a last minute grab for the "temple destruction" cards.

Altogether a solid game, best with 3 or more, though the two-player variants listed here are still quite enjoyable.

Muito bom. Gosto de jogos que parecem de guerra mas você tem como ganhar sem focar nisso. O único jogo da família "Rondel" que joguei.

This game has an interesting buildup to a lousy endgame.  The cost of fighting discourages it, until a nuclear strike at the end of the game becomes neccessary to get the last couple of points.  The game always seems to end with 'this would be more interesting if we fought earlier'--but it never seems to be the right idea to do so.

RATING: 7
A neat game with a neat theme and a number of viable paths to victory.  The deterministic combat doesn't work quite as well here, where you're actually concerned about your troops, as it does in Imperial, and I can imagine that the endgame usually turns into folks sniping for that last conquest VP.

While the beginning of the game started out fine, once you get into taking over other cities (the good part) the game ended too quickly.  One player moved out his ships and took over 2 cities with Temples and wound up earning 3 victory points and the game ended in one turn.  I would have liked to have a few more round of trying to eliminate other players, or at least require more victory points for a win.

RATING: 4
A great Euro civilisation game with all the pieces (colonisation, economy, technology, military, diplomacy) distilled down. I was pleasantly surprised; shorter and cleaner than I feared; however I'm not sure about its replayability.

Duration: Length is moderate even with 5 players because of limited actions, but downtime can spike when players discuss what to do. Bookkeeping is minimal.
Design: Other players complained about starting player advantage and positioning. There are fiddly mechanics (taking a move to siege and calculating city defences) and rules ambiguities (running out of coins, moving multiple armies at once) but it plays pretty cleanly.
Strategy: There were a variety of approaches (economic, expansionist, technologist, military) and always an attractive alternative nearby. Wars are expensive and require very specific objectives.
Components: Nothing special.
Theme: Ancient civilisations cleanly and well done.

First play.  Not my really my kind of game.  I don't like games where combat is an option and your opponents get to watch your troop buildup and match you piece for piece.  I think it needs some kind of hidden information to make it less methodical and obvious.  As a wargamer, these euros where you build all day and then attack someone feel unnatural to me.  The fighting feels out of place and forced.  Attacking someone feels like burping at the dinner table.  In a wargame it's expected and feels normal.

I have yet to play a game that wasn't lopsided. It takes a group of players that are willing even the pressure on the opposing players or someone will run away with it which creates the usual host of problems inherent to a system like that.  Still, it's a pretty decent game for 6players and a rondel game at that, so it's hard to go too terribly wrong here.

No matter which empire you choose, build those temples.  They will be your best help in earning lots of money, marble, gold, and iron, which in turn will help you build whatever you need or want to build.  Of course conquering your enemy's areas also helps, but not as much as temple-building will.  I lost my first (and so far only) game by failing to build temples as soon (and as many of them) as I should've.  I hope I won't make the same mistake the next time I play it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent game, perhaps worthy of the "Civ-Lite" moniker it received.  The rules are straightforward, there is a tech tree of sorts, and when you look at the way certain elements work you can see a touch of Civilization heritage there.

The rondel mechanism is a fantastic idea, not only interleaving player actions but also placing restrictions on how fast a player may return to the same action.  I can see this being played for some time to come.

UPDATE 14AUG08:  Now the initial sheen has worn off, I feel compelled to reduce the rating for this one - down to a 7.  I just don't think this one has stood the test of time as well as other games.  It's still a good game and one I like to play; however it just doesn't see enough table-time to justify keeping it rated 9.

Jogo fácil e estratégico. Legal.

RATING: 9
Rating is for my only game, 2-players using the (amazing!) half-map variant available here. The game follows the line of typical "antique battles in the meditteranean" genre, but the very well done winning conditions make sure that you have to balance development and confrontation. As such, my girlfriend enjoyed it very much even though she's ususally not very fond of wargames.

The only drawback (and the reason I do not rate it a 10) is that the final points seems to be won in a "rush" where the player forgets all about reasonable development and just dashes for it, leaving his civilization crippled... This might in fact prove an advantage for the first player in a turn, who has just the "little edge" to start this sprint before the others.

A note on the rondel: this is a neat choice-limiting device, but it's in no way the heart of the game.

Antike was never a game I wanted to try, but it came up so I went for it. What a surprise! Turns out this is now my favourite Gerdts game. I've enjoyed other games of his, but I have often found them bloated. This one is such a lean game of development. Perhaps a little too straightforward, but it works very well with 5 or 6 players and the theme comes through as the civs start to grow and then the tension rises as war crushes in on the borders. The board quality is a bit lacking and I wish there were a few little things to make this game tighter for 3 or 4 players, but overall I really enjoyed this and I think it would work very well with casual gamers too. Good work, Gerdts!

Also wondering if there are any strategies that work better than others.  Do people start to play it the same way every time?

RATING: 6
Victory point race game- not a real civ game, & as others have mentioned, combat offers no reward- so it hurts you. This takes away from the fun factor. Historically, the conquering civilizations got stronger through doing so, not weaker. As far as strategy, it comes down to attacking temples in the end, plain and simple. I do enjoy the rondel system, but think it's put to far better use in Imperial 2030, which is infinitely superior to Antike (as a rondel game), and an excellent gaming experience- though very different. As for ancient civ games with area control, Mare Nostrum Empires provides a very enjoyable, less dry & more thematic experience than this. Antike is, however, very intuitive and easy to learn for such a game, and for those looking for a no luck, simpler civ game may enjoy it.

This game is deceptively simple on the surface, but offers many layers of strategic thinking. Although completely luck-free, it doesn't feel at all static and deterministic like chess.

I don't like the fact that there is no ranking among the players who did not win. Thus big kingmaker problems. And you it is better to mass units than to attack. But I think Antike II fixes at least the latter problem.

A very streamlined rule set makes this game easy to pick up.  Turns go by pretty quickly; the estimated 120 minute play time seems to be pretty accurate.  There is a nice balance between military, intellectual, and civilization-building goals.  The rondel mechanism is a really elegant device for constraining the actions available on each turn.  The second half of the game can tend to drag on a bit, because the (perceived) rate of advancement slows down.

This is a much more interesting game with four players than with three.

Great 'civ light' game which requires keeping an eye on your back. Best with more players as the turns are quick. Rules are relatively simple.

I can see why there has been such a positive response to this game.  There is plenty to think about and it takes a couple turns before you get the hang of it.  Very nicely produced game.  My guess is that this is best with more than three.

I hate to do this, the rules are so clear and simple, the pieces are nice, the board is gorgeous, the rondel *is* a nice feature, but it just doesn't add up to fun for two players.

The board is *huge*, even with four nations, it doesn't fill up until late in the game. There are only three resources, which are easily amassed once a few temples go up, and the coins (free at every turn) make sure its very rare to be short of anything. 

So once you've got a marble city temple ensuring easy temple building, and an iron city temple (or three) ensuring rapid troop production. Then its just a matter of spreading out a little and then sacking a temple or two. 

I'll guess that it looks better with more players, earlier conflicts, probably more competition for cities based on their output, etc. But then it becomes an elimination game (yes, I know you can't sack a player's final city, but so what? They aren't going to make a comeback.), which isn't very appealing either. 

My last gripe is the number of VPs suggested for two players makes the game take *forever*, and pretty much eliminates any variety in the path to victory. You simply *have* to fulfill all the different reward conditions to get enough. 

Lowering the needed number of VPs would seem at first to fix that by shortening the game, but then there would be no reason for the players to interact at all, they could just quickly expand in their corners, build some temples, etc. What a snooze fest that would be.

The cries of an actual civ-lite game are accurate IMHO. We played our first game (no experience from any of us) and completed the game in just over 2 hours, including rules explanation. Turns play very quick, so downtime is very limited. I love the mutual destruction (no dice) combat rules and the rondel is ingenious. It epitomizes the "too many options but can only choose one right now" trademark of a good Euro. Winner of first game used know-how strategy primarily, and only used combat once, as a final blow to destroy a temple for their last ancient personage card. UPDATE - played 4 times now, and rating stands

Ranking after 1 play.  Seems like a really tight game.  The rondel is a very nice game mechanism.  I'm hoping there are as many paths to victory as I think there are, but more plays will be required to make that decision.

RATING: 5
For me it's the wors of the Rondel. Take almost just the combat part of Imperial or the navigation from Navegador and you have Antike, not many decissions apart from that. The possibility of making a whole round over the rondel in one move spoils the game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The action rondel is the highlight here, a clever innovation that generates tough timing decisions throughout the game and keeps the pace from flagging.  I'm much less impressed with what takes place in the remaining 95% of the board, which is fraught with the usual problems of the territorial empire-building genre.  Fans of that style of game should react positively to Antike, unless they dislike the emphasis on logistics and timing rather than sweeping conflict.  Also, fans of this publisher's previous game Neuland (*shudder*) should love this one.  One final note: the combat system gets an emphatic thumbs down from me.

Much prefer Hambergum-- I like the rondel mechanic, because it has the potential to make the game move quickly, but somehow it manages to drag anyway. It especially drags too much when victory is in sight, because of the bash the leader response.
It looks a bit like a civ game, but it's a game about getting victory point cards with the least amount of effort.

Have played this several times now.  I like this game better with more plays.  I think after my first play I was disappointed because it wasn't what I thought it was going to be. With a couple more plays I've gotten over the initial disappointment and find that it is a fun game that usually comes down to the final turn with mutliple sides able to win.

Delivers nearly all the satisfaction of Civilization in a fraction of the time. Not so as deep as Civ, and I expect it will burn out after a dozen plays or so, but it will hit the table a lot more often than that seminal game ... and when a game of Antike is over, I feel like I want to play again right away, rather than feeling like I have a hangover. Appears to play best with five or six players. Enthusiasm waning as mining marble and building temples appears to be the predominant path to victory.

This game is very good.  Similar to Mare Nostrum but IMO, a bit better.  There's close to no downtime.  Most of the times, my turn came back without me having the time to really think of what to do... it's that fast.  The action choosing mechanic is quite innovative and works very well. It also seems to have a great replay value because there's so many ways to win the game.  

This game is a great one to mix up wargamers(light) with those who don't really care for it.  I won the first game I played by attacking only once.  That makes it GREAT for me!

Played 20+ times with 2,3,4,5&6 players. Plays well with all numbers, best with more though even the 2 player game works. This is the game Risk should have been. Simple and quick to play with nobody getting elliminated and no run away leader. My thoughts after just 2 games are that alliances could have been formalised in the rules, I have never been one for free flowing alliances within a game, I like diplomatic agreements to be clear cut and enforced by the rules. I will likely re-write these comments after more plays. *UPDATE* Just played another game with 6 players. A game that is providing me with this much enjoyment has got to be a ten. *UPDATE* After 10 plays I find there are often grumbles around the table at game end about the sudden often anticlimatic way the game can finish. Note that these grumbles never come from me, I love the game but I don't feel it has the perfection needed for me to rank it a 10. Having a balance of player experience makes for the best play.

*UPDATE* Antike II is very similar but subtly better. Simple as. I'm knocking down the base game rating, I'll always play Antike II in preference. April 2016

Another attempt at doing "Civilization light". The "war component" is fairly light and doesn't come fully into play until a bit into the game, but in the end, there will still be enough of territorial considerations (armies and fleets moving around, attempts at conquests, etc.) to make it depart from the hard-core eurogames more than what works for me personally.

I really enjoyed this game. As a five player game it lasted close to 3 hours, as a three player game we finished in just under 2 hours.  I have yet to play a four player game.  I think that the game could use a few extra card components.  An example would be the first player to wipe out another players army or navy gets a point.  The game tends to have a nature direction of acquire resources, expand your empire until you encounter others, acquire more resources, buy knowledge, build massive army  - loose game by one point.

I would say this is a very even game as no one player ever lost the game by more than 2 points.

Simple rules, but the hard part is that it is NOT a wargame, but it so hard to leave territorial disputes for what it is and concentrate on the objective of the game, to score personalities (the points) for which you need a certain territorium (hence the problem :) ). Looking forward to a 5 player game where we use only 1 starting City.

RATING: 7
An excellent resource management and area control game. The game mechanic of moving round the wheel is very interesting as it offers players the opportunity to perform whatever action they desire on their turn, but sometimes at a cost. This means players often have to spend two or three turns planning towards something they want to do.

In the games I've played I haven't got involved in much combat as it generally seems to benefit any players not involved. I would tend to only go for combat if it means an instant VP reward to make it worthwhile.
Still, there are many possible routes to victory and I'm sure a combat heavy strategy could win if played correctly.

All in all it's a very interesting game and is actually quite simple to teach and not too long to play, coming in under two hours.

It is described as civ-lite.

The game is fast paced and can be played in 1.5 hours. It holds up to six players.

Combat is predictable and mutually destructive. You win if you have numerical superiority. Both sides trade losses and the last man standing wins. This means that it is advisable to hold off from engaging in combat until the end of the game. 

The games that I have played have ended too quickly and abruptly. I would suggest modifying the game to make it so that you need an extra ancient personage.

On the fence about whether or not this is even worth trying after reading so many comments saying that combat (interaction) is punished, I don't think I want to play this.

ooo.. I like this game...  very fluided mechianics.

Strategy : focus on economy.  Get marble to build a temple on a marble square to get more marble to build temples on the other two resources. War is fun, but only build enough armies for good defence. Only attack if you can get a point, and when you do, it should be near the end of the game to avoid a long counter attack.  Remember points, not terrorty will when the game.  So build up, not out.

Multiple paths to victory.  The wheel mechanic makes for very quick turns, and provides the players with good control over their own destiny.  Next to no down time when playing with 4 players!  Components are of excellent quality, and I really liked the starting position/Cities cards and player aids.

The technology grid is easy to play with, and does not confer an unfair advantage to the first person to develop it (although they do get the personality card, i.e. 1VP).

Game plays faster than MARE NOSTRUM, excludes exchanges, and does not suffer as badly from leader bashing.  I would prefer randomized combat, but I found the 1:1 exchanges worked surprisingly well.

Game is a tad pricey at 51 euros, but well worth the investment as it will see a lot of table time.  Recommended!

Let me start by saying people told me this game is like Vinci. It really is nothing like Vinci. Sure it is a civ building game with conflicts that resolve similarly to Vinci. But you do not have civilizations go into decline, which is one of the most distinctive parts of Vinci. I like this one all right, but I think I might prefer it with 3 players. But since I love Vinci with 3, I doubt I'd choose this one over Vinci.

Pretty decent game, but the victory conditions don't work quite as well as they should.

With players capable of analyzing the board accurately, the game can become a chore, since there is no luck or hidden information.

RATING: 10
Easily my favourite game, only problem is trying to find enough other people willing to play it and good enough at it to make it really really fun.

Also very playable with any number of players. The fan made 2 player rules on here are excellent. It's also very good with anywhere from 3 to 6 (the more players you have the more viable military becomes and the more you feel it if you don't fully embrace the military).

I'm quite keen on maybe coming up with a couple of new maps for this game too. Admittedly it would lose the ancient roman theme but I think a Scandinavean, Indonesian or central american would work as these all pose a good balance of sea and land regions.

Lastly one other thing; if people would like a game of Antike over the internet that would be cool too, we could get maybe 4/5 of us on here and play it out with each of us having our own board and just writing out our movements so we can all follow whats happening. Might get confusing but with 4/5 keeping track we should cope.

Updated to give it a 9.5, yeh it's a great game but with no randomness in it whatsoever there is only so many times you can play it with the same gaming group. I want to find a new boardgame group when I move house and settle down though, maybe give it a whirl again then

Edit: I've fluctuated between having this at 9.5 and having this at 10 every 18 months or so... I was kind of convinced no game deserves a 10 but if tonight has taught me one thing it's that this is an outright 10 without any shadow of a doubt.

RATING: 7
Civilization 'light'. A highly abstract civilization game that can be reasonably played in 2.5-3 hours. The rondel game mechanic makes turns blazingly fast, with almost no downtime between turns--move around the rondel, and do that one specific action, maybe found a city, and possibly claim any victory points. There is a simple economics model, as well as simple combat, which is mutual annihilation. Near the end, it becomes a pseudo-war game, where some conflict is necessary to get the last remaining victory points, by launching a blitzkrieg (with roads knowledge) and destroying your neighbors' temples.

Update: played this twice with three players. We played both sides of the board, resulting in different strategies and game lengths (1.25 hrs vs 2+ hrs). While 'cutthroat' is fun, there is a tendency for two of the players to achieve a form of detente, while ganging up on the third. The usual marble strategy doesn't work as players are unhindered from spreading quickly across the board in a mad dash to grab as much territory as possible first, before settling down to working up knowledge. Once a single player has grabbed a large chunk of the board, it is difficult to beat him since the scale of the resource production will outweigh the benefits of knowledge initially.

Update (05/30/09): After playing a meaty wargame like Successors for the first time, this was a welcome relief. I also recently played Imperial, which is a re-implementation of the Rondel mechanism. The more I play this, the more I appreciate the genius of the Rondel mechanism, the clean and simple combat, resource generation, and just about everything. It is fast and furious. Is it a wargame? Yes and no. There's very little combat, except towards the end, but compared to those other titles I played, this simply sings. I'm upping it to a '9'.

Update (08/06/10): I'm glad they're coming out with a 4th edition, as the combat rules need to be clarified with more examples. This is probably the most difficult concept to grasp for newbies.

Update (10/17/10) 19 plays: I'm starting to get bored with this, as this is one of those wargames where being left alone will surely give someone the win. If any two other players start fighting with each other, the non-combatant will probably scoop up the rest of the victory points. Also, there is too much advantage for stronger players being set up next to newer/weaker players, meaning there is a right-player binding issue.

Update (10/10/11): After a year, I haven't played much of this, as I try to avoid it. It's great for introducing newbies to board gaming, but is not providing the excitement I once felt about the game. Downing to an '8' from a '9'.

Update (02/10/13): Another year of avoiding this deterministic game. Considering that Clash of Cultures is now the go-to game for scratching the civilization game itch, Antike is collecting dust. Downing to a '7'.

Antike is very clever with unique and compeling mechanics, but I feel the overall game play is hampered by the victory conditions.  They tend to drive the action in strange ways in noticable stages.

I don't enjoy the AP this causes in some players & the multiplayer chaos of the endgame.  It seems to me that there isn't much room for creative play.

Will use mission cards (see file section) if I ever play again.

A rather hollow civilization building game which mostly consists of acquiring as many resources as possible, then spending them on the best upgrade available.

More development would have improved this substantially.

RATING: 8.5
An elegantly simple game with enough combat to give the feel of carving out an empire, but there's still plenty of scope for diplomacy.  With multiple routes to victory, there's bound to be a strategy that suits your style of play.  An evenly blanced game for 6 players is a rarity and this one belongs in every gamer's collection.

Interesting mechanics, but a touch on the long side and the end-game, which seems to reduce to simply fighting it out, is a bit of an anticlimax. The variety of strategies seem to be an illusion, as it all ends up pretty much tied regardless at the beginning of the fight end-game.

Hot game - Played only once and need to play it 3 or 4 more times with a variety in the number of players. Lots of good options available to win, a nice simple battle mech, I found myself happy the game could be played in 2 hours but also wishing I could play it longer. 

A strong well organised start with sensible steady play should win this game, VERY difficult to come from behind unless everyone else is bashing each other in combat and nobody touches you. Even then some victory cards are first come first gonna reach the points total faster.

An elegant civ game, that everyone in my games group is happy to play.

I was blown away by how fun this was, especially considering how quickly it played. It felt pretty epic, but didn't last so long that it got boring. My friends enjoyed it thoroughly, and everyone was within a point of winning when it ended.

Played once, so my rating is in the honeymoon stage.

Antike is an interesting, hard to find Euro game that has combat and direct player conflict.  As far as Euro games go, Antike is quite strong in the theme department.  Each player is managing an ancient civilization on the shores of or near the Mediterranean Sea.  The player that is the first to achieve several of many goals that signify the advancement of their civilization wins.   I ♥ the rondel mechanic for selecting actions because it effectively minimizes the down time between turns.  It's fun building temples and researching technologies and destroying opponent temples for victory points.  I can't wait to play again.

Our first game took around four or so hours and I was completely decimated...twice. Still, it's got a very simple design that allows for a lot of possibilities... I felt like each space of the rondel was used equally as much. 

Note: This game does not play well with three people. Most of the time is spent avoiding attacking one another until the last turn and then going all out. Which makes the last couple turns great fun... but only 20 minutes of fun with 70 minutes of mildly enjoyable solitaire.

Area control resource management game with a rondelle.  Similar to Concordia/Civilization where you build an empire and fight other players.  Negotiation can allow alliances if you wish to avoid combat (no dice, who ever has the most men wins).  Can be a bit of a slow risk-like game.

Although I'm interested in this, most war games just don't get played by my group so this is very low on my trade list.

Played with 3 players and it was an interesting game.  There are several different paths to win depending on what you want to do.  Very little down time between turns. Good game.

Played with 5 players and still very little downtime between turns.  The player game introduces more conflict between players because you will probably need to destroy some temples to get enough VP.  Still plays in about 2 hours.

Don't get me wrong, this a well designed game with very tight mechanics (the Rotunda was a great idea).  However, the exclusion of luck and brevity for a civ builder make the game VERY dry and in the end, quite boring.  It is actually sort of ironic as the two fore-stated issues are Antike's biggest selling points.

Description: Grow your civilization, discover technology, and wage wars. Earn victory points through exploration, tech, buildings, expansion, or conquest.

Pro: Many paths to victory. Possible to win without conflict. Techs and infrastructure make defenses better. Interesting action mechanic based on a circular tract. Great People as victory points keeps an abstract concept in theme. Wooden bits are fantastic.

Con: Complex enough to be a little confusing. Many things to keep track of.  A little downtime between turns.

This is on the short list of games (with Age of Steam and 1830) that I rushed out and bought after one play.  It was a five player session, and really scratched the abstract combat itch.  Having both armies and fleets is a big plus as well.

Two further plays have left me somewhat disenchanted.  The end game is all about laboriously stopping people from winning, with even people far out of contention compelled to participate.  Will continue to play, but if it bogs down like this in the future it may be retired.

An all right game. Not bad. Problem was my first game I was the Romans and spent the whole game feeling kind of exposed so instead of being aggressive, I played much more conservatively and ended up with 4 VP's by game end. Not even close. Oh well. My feeling was that it was a good Euro style war game. Pretty simple and straight forward with lots of agonizing decisions. It's all here for an ancient civ game. You have armies and fleets. You need to capture territory and build cities and temples to improve your economy. You need to develop different technologies. Pretty cool stuff.

There are some really clever ideas in here.  The turn action wheel is a particularly noteworthy gimmick.  Unfortunately, it suffers from the fact that all of the fun comes from the buildup of your empire.  The resolution and end game are somewhat tedious, and feel a little arbitrary (and I won).

I liked the new rondel mechanic, but the rest of the gameplay didn't grab me.  Too much of a slow buildup until somebody makes a play for the winning conditions and either wins, or fails and leaves an opening for the next player to take the win.  I prefer Imperial if I want to use the rondel.

After 1 play.

I was not impressed by it.  It's ok, but somehow there are no emotions; there's also little fighting - everybody just sits back (fighting only occasionally), develops his country and collects cards required for winning -> a bit boring...

In such titles I guess I prefer more confrontation and excitement.

In 'rondel mechanism & limited fighting' genre ( ;) ) I prefer Imperial.

RATING: 8
Great elegant civ/wargame/eurogame that has no luck and multiple paths, probably the best civ-lite type game I have played to date other than La Citta which was quite good.

The Rondel is a very neat mechanic that allows you to easily plan several turns ahead while adding turn angst as you usually can't get to where you want to be. Paying to move further along the Rondel was a great idea that at least gives you the option while also adding some angst.

The turns in the first hour are unbelievably fast and even later it really doesn't bog down too much. My first game threw me off quite a bit as it is not a wargame in the traditional sense even though it looks like one, more of a euro wargame which requires an adjustment for any Grognards. I missed the point playing from old habits and was immediately worried about attacks and attacking rather than focusing on the many other goals that give you the points to win.  

I Like this more than Tempus as that game only has scoring at the end making some of your efforts seem somewhat wasted throughout, also the war in Tempus often isn't even a good option, here its a little more viable at the right times and it works better too. 

It did seem a tad long with 5 and maybe Morgan D is right as the last VP seems quite long to acquire so that would be easily adjustable. It could have a problem staying fresh but only if you over play it which shouldn't happen with all the great games to choose from these days. 

Other than that quite hard to find any faults in this game so far, no luck (You know exactly where you go wrong and why the winner won), double sided board for added replay, multiple paths, fast pace, great game.

Rating could rise with more plays

My preference is Imperial, but I enjoy Antike. It can feel a little dry sometimes. Turns are usually short, so there is little downtime except when a maneuver turn comes up. One of those games where you can guess the winner a little too long before the game ends, making the end-game feel like a bit of a drag.

Another Civ style game, we just can't get enough of these, can we? The rondel is something new and really makes you consider what move you can afford to make and which you can afford to skip.  I also really like the different objectives.  You can play your style of game and work towards those particular objectives, but you need to keep your options open too. Very good and luckily pretty short too.

A Civilization "Lite"! The rules can be explained in 10 minutes and setup time is 1 minute. It has the Civilization feeling, but can easily be played in 2 hours. Very enjoyable and quick-paced game of civilization building and conquest. The game is well balanced, and good-looking. The Rondel (the way you choose your action each turn) is a excellent, magistral and innovate mechanism. I prefer Mare Nostrum.

RATING: 8
I think this is the best Civ Lite game so far. I've yet to have a 3 or 4 player game take more than two and a half hours and have frequently come in under two hours, so it has the "Lite" side down. You have to accept the premise of a lite game, which is that everything is vastly streamlined:  there are only eight techs (arranged in four branches), there is only one city improvement (temples), there are only three resources (iron, marble, gold), there are only two military units (legions and galleys). That said, Antike captures the essence of the genre.  I'm happy to sacrifice trade in the interests of speed of play.  The multiple types of victory points are handled very elegantly and really make the game competitive and true to its theme of building a great civilization.  The endgame sometimes becomes a military struggle, which I think is a wonderful climax to a fun 90 minutes of gaming.  I love it.  Sometimes we use a house rule in board set up:  we try to distribute starting positions in a triangle (for 3 player games) or at each corner (for 4 player games).

Rating after 3 plays. I still don't know what to think of this game. Despite a couple of less than satisfactory experiences I still want to play it again.
The main problem seems to be that the different strategies are not enough 'different'. You can't win without taking at least one Scholar card (possibly 2) and attacking temples in the first turns is nearly impossible without one of the +1/+2 movement improvements.

RATING: 6
I have now played Antike twice, once with 4 players and once with 6, both times on the Western Med board. 

To sum-up: It's a clever, fast civ-building game and it's the closest we've got to a "playable" Civilization yet. 

But despite being closest, it's still not a proper replacement for that old classic: All the particulars which made Civilization the classic it is are still missing in Antike: No population expansion (just the usual build-armies-and-fleets instead), no trading, no sense of rise and fall of civilizations, no calamities, and a much weaker tech advance system. City-building is also much more abstractly handled in Antike - here a city is basically just an area control marker, rather than in Civilization's unique approach where cities interact with population in a number of interesting ways. 

Instead of "Civilization Light" we get a fast-moving game where each nation continuously expands (in territory, advances, temples, etc.) until one reaches the winning VP threshold. The action selection mechanism, using the roundel, is surprisingly clever and leads to many agonizing choices. Hit-the-leader problems are to a large degree eliminated, since VP are scored throughout the game, and can't be lost once gained. 

About the balance of the VP level threshold, in my two games it worked fine. Especially in the 6-player game where it felt like the game ended at just the right time. The 4-player game looked like it had the potential for a drawn out endgame (with people pursuing temple sacking just for the sake of that last VP), but luckily (?) we escaped that. However, I can easily imagine that playing to 12 VP with 3 players would lead to a long, horrible endgame. Luckily, the fix for this is easy; play to a lower amount of VP instead. 

Generally, my feeling is that the game works better with many players: With few players the board feels too open, and there is too little competition for the VP cards. Why these elements weren't scaled down with fewer players, I don't know: It does seem like an obvious approach (eg. play on only half the board and with a subset of VP cards with three players), instead of changing the VP threshold. 

All in all, I like the game. It's not - for me at least - the classic that Civilization is, but at least Antike is fun (for now, ask me again in a year), and is fast enough that it actually gets played.

Initial Rating 8.0 (July 2010)

I thought Antike was better than it really is, but I still like it a lot. A strong point (for me) is that Antike has no luck whatsoever but sadly (for me) it isn’t a combat nor a civilization game, it´s more of a VP race game themed as an empire building game.You race to get VP founding cities, building temples, acquiring knowledge, controlling area on land and sea or destroying enemy temples. Another fun innovation (for me) was the rondel mechanic; it keeps the game flowing and minimizes a little the analysis paralysis that some people can experience.  Also the game is easy to learn and teach as the rules are very easy and intuitive.

On the bad side, the game is very unbalanced as the starting positions at the center have a steep disadvantage compared to those located on the periphery.

Antike was one of the first games I ever played, nowadays, I never want to play it, it is too unbalanced, I dislike the rondel mechanic, it is very similar to Imperial (another game I dislike), it takes too long for what it offers and it is boring.

RATING: 7
Based on a solo play and a 5 player FtF. Thoroughly enjoyed both - won them both too, although the solo one was a lot easier!

It plays quickly and smoothly, you need to be logistically efficient with your moves to avoid falling behind if experienced players are in play, and it looks good. There are a number of different ways of garnering the required victory points (although you'll need to use most of them to win) but the strategy is in deciding in which order to go for the objectives. You also need to be flexible enough to deal with what the other players are doing. 

There are plenty of opportunities for negotiation/influencing, and it comes to a sudden end when one player meets the victory point requirement. While some commentators have criticised the sudden end, to me it steps up the level of tension when you know certain players are getting close to victory - you had better be getting close too!

1 play with four players....not bad.  I like the rondel mechanic.  This is kinda a hybrid Euro type game with an attacking option(akin to endeavor or shogun).  I almost feel like it lacked a true identity.  It takes a lot of great mechanics from familiar games but combined they made for just an okay game.  I really need to play this a few more times but decided to trade it for battledore.

Excellent game - plays very quickly and smoothly - 4 player about 90 minutes with rules explanation - Resource/Civ development but with conflict - you can't ignore the other players. A lot of fun. Played the MidEast side of the map, which (according to the experienced player) is more interesting and a little more difficult. And played a 6 player (and I finished last, dead last, 2 pts) and this was about a 3.5 hour game and it was still very good.

RATING: 6
Based on only 1 play and will possibly revise if play again.  My worry is that combat is so costly compared to the possible gains (the real winners of any combat are those not involved) that it becomes a race as to who gets the best of the initial resource race.  So the focus is on stamping out your territory and clever use of the rondel to get ahead in resources whilst retaining enough defence to make being attacked unlikely - interesting in itself but would have liked more ebb and flow of the empires.

I love the game mechanics, and the victory point method is clever.

No hidden information, no random elements. Every turn you feel like your decision makes a difference, and you have a choice of 1 (out of 3 free ones) or you can pay resources to move further on the the rondel/wheel, enabling more choices.

My friends *always* want to play this game.

Based on two plays.  This game has an easily graspable rule set that provides for surprising combinations of tactics.  This is a new flavor of resource management/wargame, with the "rondell of doom" not just encouraging thinking two or three turns ahead, but absolutely requiring it.  Very deep for a 150-180 minute experience.

Upon furter play, it would seem that this game does not play well with three.  With five, the Occidental board is terrible for the poor sap caught in the middle.

RATING: 6
Much too long for what it is.  There seems to be only one or two viable strategies... just minimise the number of turns required to do what you want and you should do well.

With a five or six players, if the game is close, there aren't enough victory points for anyone to actually get enough points necessary to win!  Then, the first person to sack a temple wins in a sudden death situation.  Very contrived...

The end game play among competent players will then always be the same... defend  your temples until someone makes a mistake!  Not what I like to see in any game.  I doubt that I'll play it again with more than 4 players.

Trim the victory points by one across the board and you'll have much more exciting finishes with all numbers of players.  A variant giving "special powers" to each of the individual nations would also be a benefit, so some of the central powers actually have a chance to win.

My rating has gone up slightly only because I finally played a game with only 4 players and it clocked in at just over 2 hours... much better.

RATING: 7
The first time through, I thought it was one of the best games ever.  While it is really fun for 5-10 games, its appeal tapers off quickly.  

It's purely deterministic, which is ascetically pleasing at first.  But to go from understanding basic strategy to being really good at the game you have to master micromanaging. In chess, these details all fit under some metaphor of "attacking", "controlling the center," but in Antike, they are impersonal arithmetic.

If you just want to have fun with a game for a little while, this is a great buy.

The action (such as it is) takes quite awhile to get going, as the first half of the game involves spreading out to acquire all the territories on the map. As "combat" is a deterministic one-for-one mutual elimination, the very threat of a nearby enemy arming himself interrupts your plans for getting production/temples/know-hows, forcing you to reply in kind by creating units. 

Players seem to score more or less at the same rate, and anyone who can get an edge in the amount of resources being produced will over time be able to dominate militarily and probably win a slight victory. I used the phrase "zero sum game" to describe the feeling the game left me with, and unfortunately it's much too long for what it offers--no surprise, no drama, predictable outcomes.

Interesting civilization game whereby players are trying to a fixed number of ancient personalities to win the game. I do wish that there were more personalities available for when you have 5 or 6 players.

I do like the fact that once personalities are gained, by meeting certain requirements, you cannot lose them even if you later fall below the requirements.

RATING: 5
Players each take on the role of an ancient civilization in its infancy - before the invention of the wheel even, if that is to be believed, but the game is in no way intended to be historically accurate beyond the general start locations on the board. The board is two-sided, so you can choose the lands of the Roman Empire in Western Europe or the lands of Alexander the Great in SE Europe and Arabia. On a turn, each player performs one action, founds cities if they are able, and then takes any personage card for which they qualify. Personage cards are gained when certain achievements are accomplished, such as building 3 temples, expanding to 5 cities, and being the first to develop a "know-how" (technology). The first player to collect a certain number of cards (depending on number of players) wins.

The actions are of three kinds: collect resources from cities (gold, marble, or iron), spend collected resources (to gain know-hows, build temples, or arm soldiers and galleys), or manouvre (move military and fight). With these few rules civilizations grow, develop and eventually go to war in pursuit of the prized personage cards.

Antike isn't without its problems, and most of those are in the end game, I think. The final accomplishment for most civilizations will be to destroy a neighbor's temple. This makes the focus at the end more on preventing your opponents from winning rather than pushing forward for the win yourself. If all civilizations are well-managed and fortified, I could see this end-game dance playing out for quite a while. Also, even though the game certainly makes no attempt to portray real history, it makes no sense that a civilization should win by making a last-ditch gambit to send their entire army to one location to destroy a city. It's as if time stops at that point and the civ has absolutely not a care in the world about what dangers it exposes them to the next day. Ultimately it's a bit of a letdown following what is otherwise an excellent game.

UPDATE: Every time I play this game, I'm slightly more disappointed in it than the previous play. I think I'm calling it quits now. This started as an 8 and now has settled at a final score of 5, where I think it will stay.

Picked up at Essen 2005, played one five-player game. Preliminary rating would be 8 or possibly 9 as I liked it a lot.

Of the five people playing, the two gamers (one of them being me) liked it a lot, as did the wife (who is somewhere inbetween a non-gamer and gamer). The two non-gamers (they like Settlers, TtR and lighter games) weren't that keen on it but still thought it was OK (or so they said).

What was most surprising to me when playing was the lack of conflict, I had expected it to take a much bigger part than it did (in our game we only had about five battles, if that). In fact, one of the non-gamers (or should that be Settlers-fans) commented that it felt a bit like multi-player solitaire. I suppose there is some truth to this, as you at least in the beginning of the game seem to concentrate on your own civ without too much contact with the others.

One thing I liked about it was the pace, turns come around very quickly and there is very little down time. Strangely enough the Settlers-fans commented that it was a very long game even though it lasted shorter than a typical Settlers-game, whereas the three of us that liked it didn't think this at all. The 'Rondel' is a very nice mechanism, and as I found out you can get a bit 'out of sync' on it when the other gamer moved some troops too close to me for comfort, so even though he never attacked me I had to temporarily abandon my strategy to instead waste a few turns to get iron and build units, which left me in the wrong place on the rondel.

Hmm, this turned out a bit long. Maybe it should have been a session report.  ;)

Looking forward to play again, €38 well spent.

Yes, this IS civ-lite.  It has war, economy, technology, historical nations etc etc.  So why has it not been crowned as such?  Perhaps its because its deterministic - there is no luck at all - or perhaps because its a bit generic (no special civ powers) - but its certainly got the important bases covered (except for trading).  My biggest gripe is a common one with civ games - the scope of the game indicates that one turn equals many years (50-100), yet armies can only move one region per turn.  Makes no sense at all, but its common with almost all of these games.  Also, the player who avoids combat most will generally win ... I guess its like Pirate's Cove in that respect, he he.  I guess I agree with Chris Farrell that in the end the diplomacy aspect will determine the winner more than anything else ...
-------------------------
Update - played more Tempus now and decided that Tempus is better than Antike - it just has more game per unit time playing.  In terms of civ-lite options, Antike is probably fourth in line, behind Mare Nostrum, Tempus and Roll Through The Ages.

RATING: 6.2
Played this one with 6. It has a nice board and components (like ship meeples and soldier meeples). The game design demonstrated a great marriage between theme and mechanism, like the know-how abilities (sail increasing boat movement, market increasing resources, etc), and the application of the different resources (marble for temples etc). 

The rondel was a pretty cool mechanic. But somehow, since the rest of the game had such tightly-integrated theme & mechanics, the abstractness of the rondel stuck out to me. But I did like how it was built such that rondel slices that were complementary to each other were always just out of reach. This required some interesting choices and careful planning.

I liked the diversity of achievements required to get victory points - it encourages strategic complexity and multiple routes to victory. Like Galactic Emperor, this one is a pretty unforgiving game, where if you make a few bad decisions early on, they will haunt you for the rest of the game, and it seems nigh impossible to mount a come-back; so, there seems more of a strategic learning curve to this game than many other games. 

With 6 players, the Greeks (center position) were attacked on 5 fronts. All other armies were attacked max by 3 fronts. So there is a balance issue here; if not a persistent disadvantage, there is at the very least a steeper learning curve for effective strategy in the center. I like games with asymmetry, but I like the asymmetry to have advantages and disadvantages for each side (like in Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation (Deluxe Edition)). In this case I don't see any advantages that make up for the disadvantages of being surrounded on all sides and vulnerable to attack by more armies than anyone else.

Also, since the ability to do pretty much everything you would want to do in the game is tied to resources, and resources are tied to the cities you own, getting attacked and losing cities can lead to a pronounced negative feedback loop, and a "runaway loser," poor-get-poorer effect. I particularly don't like this dynamic, and I believe this design is unique to this game relative to other (modern) games I've played.

So, given the above issues, and given the fame and hype I'd heard about the game, this was overall a disappointment for me. But, I would try again maybe with 4 players, so at least the balance issues wouldn't be present, and see how that plays out. I'll give it a tentative 6 out of 10 pending further play. But, if I want to play a game that involves conquest, nation building, resource management and area control, I would pick Wallenstein over Antike any day.

RATING: 7
Another rondel game which I generally like. Reminds me of Cyclades except that it is a perfect information game. Cyclades has special ability cards. There are more ways to stop a player's actions in Cyclades with the bidding, whereas in Antike, no one can prevent a rondel action.

There are rewards for avoiding conflict as much as possible. While you may gain a city or destroy a temple for a VP, doing so early means building forces to attack instead of shoring up your defenses or building your economic engine. Science seems like a good early objective. Especially the market and government ones.

I like the game and when played with people without AP it is a blast.  This game should be simple, fast flowing, somewhat aggressive, and little headache.  If people with AP try to play this like it is Advanced Civilization, then the game is just not worth playing... but that is not the game's fault.

5/10 rating after initial play. There is more potential in it and I can understand why people rate it higher. My own enjoyment isn't as high. This was in part due to a doomed strategy but more fundamentally due to the mix of confrontational elements with Euro-like gameplay. Either give me a confrontational Ameritrash dicefest or let me optimize.

The first moves might be programmed that you have to build armies/ships and then manoeuvre.

The conflict rules lack elegance. I disliked that armies can attack ships and vice versa when a city is attacked but can't attack each other in the same area otherwise. But this should not be played as a wargame anyway.

I really like the rondel mechanism here, and the choices between expansion, attacking, resources and discoveries.  I've played it twice and both games were close, which in my mind is the mark of a solid game.

RATING: 7
I like this. Early on it is great fun, building up my little empire, trying to optimize rapid expansion and resource development. It has the feel of a real-time PC game like Age of Empires or Starcraft. Turns move very quickly. For a while it is tense, but it also feels kind of multi-player solitaire. It's neat how you can get your victory points in so many different ways, and I think that contributes to the tension in competition for some of the points associated with developing our cultures or building temples and cities. In the endgame the expanding empires butt up against one another and the arms race begins for the final victory points. I'm a sucker for the genre.

RATING: 6
A good use of the rondel, if not quite in Imperial's league (few games are, rondel or no). Of course things are going to bog down when there are a lot of military units on the board, and it's probably a good idea to keep a running count of city production just to speed those phases up. It's perhaps just a smidge less satisfying to me, after one play of each, relative to Mare Nostrum, and I'm not sure I can say why. (I don't think it's because I won the former.) Antike has the advantage of slightly tighter mechanics and a much more readily apparently scoring system, but it may lack just a little bit of the richness of the combat and cards in Mare Nostrum. Components are pretty much a wash, with Antike being a bit more functional and MN being a bit nicer looking in terms of boards. The option to play the "East" in Antike is a plus. Antike may reward turtling too much--it did for us, anyway, or maybe I just held back too long.

Such a great and intense game. It's a eurogame with some real teeth and a hard bite.  It's very much a race, based around resource management, but combat can be absolutely devastating to an opponent or yourself. Being combative doesn't seem to be a possible strategy to win, but you probably can't win without causing a few fights.

Game does have some possible balancing issues. At least on one side of the board.

Seems like it wouldn't work too well with 3 players, and 6 would just get so crowded.  I like the rondel mechanism, and there are always way too many things you want to do that you cannot.  I'm interested in trying to flesh out different strategies (huddling off in a corner or just sacking everything within reach) to see what happens.  It seems like it's hard to be too aggressive, and that it may not always pay off, but it is usually necessary at some point.  The play time is manageable.  Update: just not that interesting for me.Traded away.

A pretty stripped-down civ game. Like most other people, I find the first part of the game to be great. But the end half (when armies are amassed) feels terrible. Combat seem too disadvantageous for the aggressor so no one wants to attack first. Plays better with fewer players (I think 4 is the sweet spot).

RATING: 5
The first board game with war elements to interest me in awhile, Antike plays quickly with little down time. The first few games have had only light interaction, which is a concern. The main problem so far is that a player with no army has consistently been able to grab enough victory points to win before more aggressive players have challenged him. I think these issues will recede with more plays. The key to making the game work is to ensure that it almost always ends with the victor needing to destroy a couple of temples to secure victory.   Update: I have lowered my score because I am a bit tired of the exponential growth model, the slow build-up, and the attack the leader factor (unless you can't get to him because he happens to be in a corner). Update: lowered to 5 and sold - same reasons.

This went over well.  based on 3-4 plays only, but I feel in tune with the game enough to fairly rate.  Nothing wrong with a 6-7.  It is tense, competitive and there are enough decisions/options to make the game replayable and interesting.
the fun factor is a tad low, but overall a strong game, and it I found it cheap, or in a trade, I would pick it up quickly.
The designers next effort, Imperial, didn't do as much for me.  but some of that dissapointment could be blamed on my overall dissapointment with Euros of late...
I shall have to revisit that when I come around!

Several plays in, I can safely say that I like this game.  The turns spin past and it offers some fun decisions on how to achieve the needed number of cards to win.  I do have some concern that a civ in the middle of the map is at a disadvantage compared to a civ with a safe border on the map edge.  Therefore I recommend playing with 4 players.

Vinci has always held a special place in my game collection, despite it's flaws.  Antike is the first civ game I've played that could actually dethrone Vinci for me.  I like the ability to advance and win the game by other methods than just smash and grab.  I like that you can't win the game by maximizing your advantage strictly in one area of winning conditions, you must be balanced to win.  Employs the same battle resolution as Vinci, which helps immensely for playtime, and to eliminate bad dicerolls (like A&A) as reasons for a loss.  Other than Kreta, my favorite game of this year.

Really like the multiple ways to build the civilization in this game.  Combination of resource collection and combat mechanics is pretty cool.  It is like Settlers and Cities and Knights with the resource collection and spending on advancements but there are no dice and you can conquer other player's territory.

Make sure to read all the rules as in one of my plays we missed the victory point awarded for being the first civ to complete all the advancements and essentially stalemated the game.

RATING: 8
Antike is one of those games that beg for several plays before a definitive judgement as the most intuitive starting strategies are the ones that lead to a very dry ending. But, for those who don't know much about the game, I'll try to resume the basic principles.

The most important of all the mechanisms that the game employs is the rondel: this simple, yet deep, way of controlling the actions that reduces downtime to a minimum while forcing you to have a defined strategy. The other key mechanism is the way that you score points. Basically, you can score by expanding, investigating and conquering, though the points you can acquire each way are limited, so you must keep scoring constantly or you might find that people have drained the points you where aiming for. Lastly, the combat: you remove units from both sides at a 1:1 ratio (maybe more if you are trying to conquer a city), which makes it deadly for both sides and forces so it forces you to think precisely where and when to strike.

So, what I mentioned before about the several plays: on the first game almost everybody tries a growth strategy from the beginning to an end, which leads to a drain of all the non-bellicose points and several rounds of stagnant and growing armies, while everybody tries to wait like vultures for the first conflict to arise and then jump on the weakened sides. Once you play more games this tendency disappears and, usually, at least two or even three players are aiming for military points once they've done a minimal growth. This makes plays much more interesting and different one from another.

The game's biggest black spot are the first turns, as there are only three viable opening moves. So, once you decide if you are focusing on technologies, temples or cities, you are on fully automated mode and not making any more decisions until the fifth round or so. An even worse repercussion of this is that these starting moves need to be explained, as if a player fails to see them, he'll be severely hampered.

Would you like Antike? Well, if you want a game where luck reduces to starting positions, based on growth strategies but where caring for military is mandatory and has a light yet interesting theme, I would give it a try. And if you feel that the game ending is a bit stagnant, play it a bit more, as that will most likely reduce that feeling.

Very good civilization building game with different paths to victory and which plays in a reasonable time. Easy to learn and each round plays fast. The wheel for choosing an action is an interesting mechanism. Concentrate on the different cards (VP) and how to get them. The aim is to reach a total number of VP (depending on the number of players), not to take control of the whole map or to take out your opponents. Although combat may be needed towards the end of the game or earlier depending on your strategy.

I was expecting Antike to try and be a quick Civ lite. Guess the ever-elusive "2 hour Civ" is still waiting for its inventor. Which doesn't mean Antike is a bad game. It's an area control and rescource management Euro with a war and civ theme. Not too deeply implemented though, but it's quite neat and original in some ways.

Timing your actions seems a big part of the game, as is keeping an eye on your opponents' position on the action rondel vs. their resources, to anticipate their next move. Especially in the endgame with the all out temple destruction, where you just need to protect a couple key sites and abandon everything else. All that building and expanding until the late mid-game doesn't pay off in points as good as the final conflict, so can this be played effectively in any other way? All the criticism about Antike being too samey from play to play could be right on target, but it's compelling enough that I want to test it some more.

Only played with 4, I suspect this would be a lot better with 6, or 5 as well, because the map gets tighter.

This has the typical appearance of a Civ-like boardgame.  I wanted to like this more but I totally favor Mare Nostrum a lot more.  Antike feels like I am taking "baby step" turns in a very repetitive fashion.  There is planning involving tactics and resource management.  I don't see how a game of this can be won without involving some wargame elements, whereas in Mare Nostrum, that could be won with making one single attack (which I think is a strength in terms of game design AND replayability).  Not too bad but not really my cup of tea.

I like the concept of the rondel.  However, I just wasn't able to find the game itself all that compelling after my first play.  The general lack of conflict (unless one can destroy a temple or a tenth city by conquest, why bother?) and the fifth player basically playing a game all by himself in a five player game due to location was disappointing to me.  Okay, one might destroy a temple to destroy someone's potential production, but that seems to grant limited reward and allows someone else to build a temple.  I appreciated the different avenues to famous persons/victory points and the decisions that forced on the rondel.  Basically, I just felt that the game ended right when it was about to get interesting in that conflict was about to be forced to occur.

Excellent light civilization game that rewards several strategically diverse styles of play doesn't outlast its welcome.

Rating based on one play. I think the game plays heavily by the types of players around the table. That's not bad but that is apt to add more variety than anything else.

In the one game, one player - with a sizeable force - never moved on either of his neighbors one of whom eventually came down on me. That left me with a two front fight...which I think is likley not sustainable in Antike...

Look forward to more plays.

I really want to play this game again. I was annoyed after my first play but I think that was mostly due to the mild learning curve this game has and the fact that a bunch of newbies were playing with two guys who had played before and they pretty much dominated us. After one play though, you'll understand how the game works and what you did wrong, etc etc. Overall I think it's a nice quick playing civilization game which is something my gaming group was in sore need of. 

I almost forgot to add my love for the turn selecting rondel. Really ingenious idea that I've personally never seen used in another game.

A good game with a really nice turn mechanic. I think it could be a delusion for people searching for hystorical games, but could be a nice experience for peoples looking for a game with wars, ecomics and diplomacy. I have played it only in 6.

Played it for the first time last night and I love it.  3 player game where we each adopted different strategies and when the winner won each of the other 2 players could have won on their next turn.  Possibly in time we will find an optimal strategy, but for the moment a great game :)

The Rondel (the way you choose your action each turn) is a beautiful mechanism. The game's combat is moderate, and quitre comparable in feel to Wallenstein, but with absolutely no luck; actually there's no luck at all in this game. 

The fact that this game has more wood than any other that I own, coupled with the fact that it has 2 maps right out of the box, makes this one a winner; and I have to believe that my rating will rise with more players. This game has tremendous tension, and that will certainly be bolstered with more players involved.

If you can get you hands on this one, it's well worth it.

Update: With the advent of other Rondel based games this one drops a point.

Update 2: More plays in recent times. I don't know if it's because we've played so many more games now, or if the experience at this particular game has contributed to better play, but this one returns to an 8. 

Update 3:

This game can suffer from new players versus experienced players. The advancements have to be equally gained first in order for equal play else there can be a runaway leader. That being said, I think the game is certainly all about the advancements and lacks the diversity in paths to victory that later rondel games have.

Great Civ building game, comparable to Mare Nostrum and Vinci in many aspects.  My rating reflects it's newness to me, but I doubt my rating will fall by very much over time.  For me, one of the best games ever.

UPDATE: After more plays, went up a little in my rating. Can have a "monkey-in-the-middle" problem at times, players plaing Greece or Rome must be very, very careful.  Perhaps translating the rules to a different map, even a fictional one, in order to balace starting positions a little better?

July 2006 Update: Starting to see end-game "problem"... there are many times when it's clear someone will win the game FOR CERTAIN in X number of turns.  Makes for a bit of an anti-climax...  adjusted rating from 9.0 to 8.87 accordingly.

Looks like it's about conquest, but different comments suggest that with two players it is about civilization building.  Seems like now much antagonism occurs between players is actually up to the players and not forced (with 2 players) Have to check more into it.

The actionwheel is a clever mechanic, that sees good use in this and other games. However, in Antike we soon found ourselves competing in the same strategy - and I still don't think there are other viable strategies than aggressive expansion.

RATING: 5
Played with 6 players. It didn't work for me. Everybody seems to wait, upgrade and arm all the time. All you need to have is temples. They are much too powerful. If you start in the middle of the board... forget it. No chance to win. Sooner or later you get crushed. For an area control/fighting game pretty boring: Try 'A Game of Thrones' instead. For a civilization game not enough possibilities: Try Vinci instead.

Update: After several hints from Mac Gerdts I have to admit that 4 might not an adequate rating. It seems that I missed some opportunities the game offers. The rating 5 might go up after my next play of Antike. I'm looking forward...

RATING: 7
Antike is a rather good civ game. It take some of the essence out of Civilacation, but is not nearly as heavy. The rondell mechanism is what really lifts this game since it plays readily with 5 and 6 players in slightly above 90 min. In this timespan you have the feeling of a heavier civ game.There is low downtime loaded with interaction both on the board and in compettion of special abilities and ancient personalities, that also determine the winner. That it is an Euro with out actual victory point feels rather fresh. One of the drawbacks is that the start of the game can get a bit scripted and the replayability could be better. Even though two games wont look alike there are a bit to few real paths for victory, at least thats my feeling so far.

The "eurogame version" of Civilization. Streamlined (e.g. tech tree is reduced to only 8 progresses), diceless, abstract (personalities like kings, scientists, etc. are just names given to some conditions bringing Victory Points), simple (only a few pages of rules), with acceptable lenght and a clever idea (the "wheel of actions").
It's still quite confrontational and involving a lot of diplomacy (i.e. you'll have to manipulate the players inducing them to harm someone else).
Probably better with more players.

4 player game where I played the Greeks on the "wrong board".  I was surounded on all sides, and I lost horribly (4th place).  However, overlooking that and playing on the correct side of the board for 4 players this game is pretty darn good!  A civ game that played in under 2 hours and that's WITH learning the rules.  Doesn't get much better than that.  I would like to try this with 6 players though.  I really enjoyed this game.  This one was right up my alley.  However, if I were to rate this based on my experience playing the Greeks on the "wrong board" it would probably have been a 6 or 5.  But, I think a six player game would rock on that side of the board.

Decent Civ Lite.  Each side tends to quietly and nervously build up until someone ignites the powderkeg and all hell breaks lose.  Might benefit from trading or cooperative mechanic.  Biggest flaw is that VP targets are too goal oriented and has no correlation to strategic position.  Thus winning is all about playing possum until you're ready to abandon board position and make a mad dash to the finish line.

Wow, what an amazing game.  Diceless mechanics, a beautiful board and quality 'bits' make this a new group favorite.  I'm blown away by the two-sided board and the myriad of choices each player faces every turn.  Despite the fact that it does take longer to play than the box states (even after you've got the rules down), it doesn't detract from the game at all.

I am underwhelmed.  There doesn't seem to be enough variety in what you can do, compared to Imperial.  I should probably give it another try, at which point my rating will likely go down, but might go up.

Second play, rating stays the same.  I have played Hamburgum, Antike, and Imperial twice each and Imperial stands out as the best for me.  Much more interesting and dynamic.

I like 4 players better than 6 players, more interesting expansion options.

I have only played this one time but I do not know if it will be high on the list to play again. While i feel the rondel is an interesting game design decision, I am not so sure it works that well with the rest of the game. (for example I think it works better in Imperial)The game itself feels constrained and mechanics driven. There  really is not too much that can be done by way of diplomacy and really you are best if you keep to yourself and hope to grab points unmolested early and get lucky and have someone build temples near you for later points. It all just seems kind of white washed and vanilla to me, too much euro-game and not enough fun.

Decent, light civ-building game. Managing the different resources and choosing how to invest them (technology, military units, production, etc) is fun, but the play does feel a bit thin to me at times. Plus since points can't be lost, I've seen games won by a civ which had just been destroyed by its neighbors, but still managed to purchase another tech card. Feels strange for a shattered civ to win the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very good game except for:
1. Turtle.
2. Battle is expensive for the attacker. Unless its for the (final?) rush of VPs, un-calculated battles serves no purpose except to lose the game.
3. Not enuff meeple army. Center player without coastal cities are disadvantaged as they can only build land-units (17). They thus have to adopt a different (more difficult?) strategy.

Update: Dropped 8 » 7.5. Still like this game. Its just that I found ways to play this game which can lead to it been a really boring affair.

RATING: 7
Good 6 players game that recreates the expansion of several mediterranean and middle east civilizations through cultural achievements (know how), resource management (iron, gold and marble) and territory expansions (with or without war). You only miss the commerce for a perfect civilization little. 
The game uses the rondel mechanism to select from the different actions available each turn. 
Sometimes you miss more player interaction with the other players, specially those located at the other corners of the map.

As a big civilization computer game fan I first tried Eagle's board game. Unfortunately, it was too confusing and full of unnecessary complexities for my taste..

When I played this game for the first time, it this felt like how Civilization the board game should have been. And all in about 2 hours where you can take about 100 turns.. (Yes, the game plays really fast).

I wish I could play this game at least once a week, but most of my friends complain about the end game.

But, ever since I got Through the ages, this one got to be relegated to second plane.

Love it.  One of my favorite games after only a single play (and a few solo plays).  It cleanly incorporates elements common to most civ-conquest / dudes on a map game but into a very fast playing game.

It's a civ game in the spirit of Mare Nostrum, but it feels like you have more options - you can get VP by sailing seas, discovering knowledge, building temples, destroying temples, and building cities.  The board gets super-cramped (which is good) and the last few turns are very competitive.  It is a very good game.

Two plays. Both times I lost interest after thirty minutes when repetition set in. Could have crushed an enemy early, but took pity because I wanted the game to be fun for everyone.

The winner of both games was involved in exactly one or fewer battles, so a lot of slow building and expanding without much else of interest.

This game is good as long as the players are all relatively equal in playing ability.  The last game we played ended in a stalemate situation that was only broken when someone decided to take a risk which didn't pay off.

One complaint, combat is too expensive.  Takes a lot of movement/units to take a city.  At the same time the combat is very simple in that you take off units in pairs so there isn't any randomness.

Better with 4 players or at least less than 6
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Pretty decent game.  My play very exciting as I took/built 9 cities on the last turn to get the win.  An all-military win!  Cool.  Felt badly because there is no player elimination, so one player really just sat there a LONG time waiting for it to end.  the rondel an ok idea, but does not set the world on fire.  Odd combat: you have to equal defender to gain the city space.  Stioll, looks attractive, and the help cards are very clear, so it helps play.  Not so fond of the 'historical' personages listed on the score cards: entirely superfluous. If the game is an abstract, leave it so.

There are 5 ways to gain a victory point: for every 5 cities built, for every 3 temples built, being the first to invest in a new discovery (know-how), for every 7 water areas controlled (by ships) & for every temple destroyed.  

The rondel is what really sets this game apart.  It makes for tough decisions as you can only choose/perform one type of action on each turn & you can only move 3 spaces along the rondel for free.  The one-action per turn keeps the game moving at a steady clip.

Combat is diceless & simple, basically you need one more unit than your opponents defense to conqueur.  

This could be a war/diplomacy game depending on the game group personality (just attack more) but I see it more as a resource management, area control game.  I'm looking forward to see how future games turn out. 11/2005

UPDATE: Knocking down a point, some from less interest, some from the fact that [gameid=166857] is a slightly improved version. 01/2015

Lightest of Gerdts' rondel games -- would suggest this one first to someone who has not played them.  Fun empire-building/civ game.  Well laid-out actions can be understood well, including their consequences and the timing required to travel 'round the rondel.  Only downside is that there does not seem to be much replayability: the same few paths to VPs will dominate.

RATING: 9
Simple and elegant mechanics. I think the military path to victory is really a hard one, specially because both the loser and the winning army in a conflict lose so many pieces. Maybe I should play this with a different strategy. Need more plays to settle a score. UPDATE: tried the techpath and won. I think the game is best played with 4 or 6. With 5, one player gets a terrible starting place. I like it more everytime I play.

RATING: 8.5
Played once with three players.  An empire-building game wherein players acquire resources to build units to enable them to explore (and/or conquer) new areas so they can build cities and acquire more resources.  Victory, however, is determined by meeting specific goals, most of which are not based on expansion or military prowess.

The game is very clean: there are no special power cards, no rule-breaking abilities, only a few upgrades, and battles are entirely deterministic.  This allows for a very strategic and tactical game where every player is on the exact same footing, and luck has little to do with the outcome.

The turn mechanics are also very cool: all the actions that can be carried out on a turn are distributed around a circle; players can only choose one action per turn, and their options are limited by what's close to them on the wheel (so, for instance, there's only one point on the wheel where you can build troops; if you're not close to that point, you won't be able to build troops).  This forces players to plan their moves in advance, and also provides for interesting limitations to the game (e.g., you can't move your units on every turn, and if you do choose to move your units you can't get any resources on that turn).

Victory points are earned by achieving pre-set goals (e.g., building X number of cities, exploring a certain amount of sea-spaces), many of which have nothing to do with attacking other players.  There are a limited number of points available for each type of goal, though, so players are encouraged to take different strategies.  And, eventually, the game is likely to head to conflict (as one goal is to destroy other players' property).  

These factors all combine to make a great, brain-burning game.  King-making is a problem (as the leader will logically be attacked by everyone at the end of the game), and there is the possibility of hurt feelings (as attacking is an option, and attacks can be very damaging), but if you know that going in you'll be fine.

One problem that can occur is that it is nearly impossible to go into the "way-back machine", due to the number of units on the board and the complexity of how they can move.  Thus, it might be a good idea to make it clear that normal house rules about allowing players to take turns back are revoked for this game.

RATING: 5
A attacks B and now B is weakened so C attacks B in 6 player games so I'll never play this with 5 or 6.  Played with 4 and it's a decent game.  Finally changed my mind.  We started attacking once everyone got to about 5 or 6 VPs and 9VPs are need for victory.  I still wonder how this game would play out if you had to get 2 additional VPs (so 11VPs in a 4 player game).  Then there would be quite the battles.  Still my overall sentiment is for a game that has battles but yet strongly discourages it doesn't quite do the magic for me.  Imperial now that is a game I'm looking forward to trying.

Like Imperial, this uses the "rondel", a mechanism that I like. Played once, thoroughly enjoyed... not sure which I like better, this or Imperial. Need more plays of both. Not even sure which is easier to learn - probably both about the same. Imperial features buying shares in different nations, so the power shifts throughout the game, which is an awesome concept... while Antike features a tech tree with upgrades to defense, movement, resources, etc, which I also like very much. Both games can get book-keepy towards the end, but I think it's worth it. May be too much for a casual gamer, definitely too little for a wargamer. 

UPDATE: Moving up to a ten. Based on playing the online two player Antike Deullum, I can't imagine not wanting to play this. Streamlines the best parts of more finicky Ameritrash games. It gives you an upgrade tree and a board with a map you try to conquer.

Games with only 3 players are actually harder to 4 and 5 player games in some respects because you expand into a much larger space, which makes figuring out your defences that much harder!

RATING: 7.5
First play was a three-player - a surprisingly good experience - rules were easy to explain and untethered by confusion (for the most part), game play flowed rapidly, the experience was filled with interesting choices, difficult decisions, lots of forward planning and tactical adjustments. With three, it felt a bit more like a race than a conflict for the first half. Things crescendoed toward a climax however, and I ended up winning by attacking, but was really successful because I had waited until the other two players had decimated each other to strike. Looking forward to trying this with more players, and the rating could go up with later plays.

Played once, and won.  Was surprisingly short for this kind of game.  Good game and good concept.  But the end game was an anti-climax as everyone just repeatedly built up armies and bashed temples.

RATING: 3
I suppose I can see why this game has some appeal, but I don't plan on ever playing it again. It's way too long and repetitious for a game of this simplicity. The game seems quite formulaic: stay out of everyone's way for as long as possible and then join the mad scramble for destroying/building temples at the end of the game's end. I was a couple rules clarifications away from winning my first and only game of this, and I would probably use the exact same strategy next time. Were this a 45 minute game, I might be interested, but at two hours it's just not satisfying. For "lite civ," Olympos still gets my vote, despite its flaws.

RATING: 6.5
Based on one play. There was a strong feeling of "the rich get richer" in our game, and too much swung on the last turn, in which the largest on-board army took the day. I did very much like the "wheel" mechanic for restricting available actions.

RATING: 9
An interesting lighter weight civ game. Strategy is a little unintuitive, so I think multiple plays are necessary to really get how to play effectively. I like how the VP cards require diversity in strategy, but there are still lots of options to mix and match (expansion, knowledge, warfare, ships, temples....).

We had high hopes for this one, but it hasn't gone over well in our group.  Civ-lite it's not.  I think it's a good game in its own right, and I'd like to play it again.

RATING: 8
A streamlined civ/empire building game.  Its greatest strength is the time of play is much shorter than, say, Civilization.  However, you lose a lot of theme with the reduced game play.  The rondel is novel and innovative.  This is a solid game and a must for fans civ/empire builders (especially those who do not want to spend 3-8 hours creating then destroying an empire).

Rating of 8 after one game. I liked the rondell system, which makes for some tough decisions. The game has a that Civilization feeling of scratching out a meagre existence in your patch of the world, progressively building a stronger economy. The ending is more climactic than Civilization, though, because of the combat frenzy at the end. It definitely scratched my itch for a civilization-themed game without the 12+ hours required for Tresham's (excellent) Civilization. This is my idea of "Civ-lite". This one is becoming universally enjoyed in our larger gaming club, which is very unusual.

>>Update: A good design for its day, and one of Mac's Gerdts good early publications, but other civ-style (eg Mare Nostrum) games do "civ-lite" better.

I would normally like a civilization/battle game, but something about this just doesn't do it for me.  Over simplified perhaps.  Solitaire like in the first half and if you fight early you lose.  Later in the game when there is finally conflict it is time consuming and not intuitive.  This game is forced and not natural.  Wouldn't even call it a good abstract however....sorta falls in limbo land which is not attractive for me.  Would much prefer to play Struggle of Empires/Conquest of Empires/7 Ages/Napoleanic War/Manifest Destiny or any GMT card driven war game over this.

A real crowd pleaser.   This is the game I wish I had in college rather than Civilisation or Diplomacy (which are still good games).  Antike is the best parts of those games combined without the weaknesses.  Plenty of decisions and deals to make, but the game moves very quickly.  The Rondel concept is brilliant at moving things along while making many options to choose from.  Easily picked up by newbies.

Ancient nations battle for supremacy in this economic and warfare game. Players choose to earn income in marble, gold, or iron, build temples, move armies and fleets, build armies and fleets,  advance in progress and build cities. Players earn victory points by building cities, being the first to advance in progress, have 6 temples, etc. The first phase of the game is an economic type game, but it quickly changes to one of military warfare. Like any wargames, perception, and being outnumbered by your opponents will play a role. It's a simple game to play and the rules are easy to understand.

Great area control game with an (superficial) element of civilization building. Several paths to victory. The war element should neither repel those who do not like war games nor overly attract those who love it. The confrontational element is no bigger than say in Tikal. The rondel is a neat addition. My only complain is that it is hard to keep track on the number of resources to collect and how many cities you posses without some extra implements. Very easy to learn, good and easy to grasp rules.

Combat - simple.  Game turns - fast.  Downtime - none.  Those elements alone make the game worthwhile.  I like this game, but it attempts to take a very complicated subject, the growth of civilization, and compact it into 90 minutes.  It succeeds in doing this, but in the process of doing so, the game comes off not as detailed as I would like it to be.  I want to feel like I'm really building something.  This is not to say the game isn't bad, because it probably is the best light civ game out there, but I've finally come to the conclusion that if you are going to play a civ game, you bite the bullet and play for at least 3-4 hours.  If you refuse to play over that period of time and still want a civ-builder, then Antike is the game for you.

It's become a collector's item, but I imagine more for nostalgia's sake or the fact that it was a grandfather game for Imperial and Navegador, both of which are much more engrossing versions of a similar game.

This weekend, after two years on a friend's shelf, we played Antike again.  And it will be my last.

Here's what happens if you start a war you can't win in one turn, or if one of your opponents does the same to you: You lose the game.  Both you and your opponent are virtually assured of loss, because the sludge of war insists you invest your resources in these efforts.  Meanwhile, the other players run away with the other victory points.

After 90 minutes of watching myself lose because another player thought I'd back down, I'm done.

A euro masquerading as a wargame. Some people I play with seem to like this game better than I do, which means I've played it a few times despite being not that hot on it.

It's important not to get caught up in fighting too much and concentrate on economy, resources, and technologies. However I often get caught up in fighting nevertheless.

The graphic design is a little old-fashioned.

RATING: 7
Very simple rules that make for an elegant and higly entertaining game, since the very few turns (at least in a 6 players game). Really streamlined in spite of being old (almost 10 years!). Its very few rules have a great reach.

The gameflow is very fast, and the game lenght can be even less than advertised.

The rondel really works well in this game.

Things I did not like (the missing 3 points for the 10):
-> Attacking has a high cost; it leaves you weak and vulnerable to counterattacks. This promotes Cold War situation and a final blitzkrieg attack to get the last points you need to win.
-> Because of that, it's strategically easier to attack someone who has just attacked or been attacked (the typical gangbang that can be seen in so many games)
-> The map is uneven (Mediterranean) for the greek (the rest are OK); he shares frontiers with 5 players (the rest only share with 2 players). With 4 players, Greece is in the middle too).
-> [Very minor issue] It's not easy to see what the cities produce once the discs are in place (it can be still be seen without moving them).

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/104955/antike-duellum]Antike Duellum[/url] is the 2 player version of this game, and it includes a few changes I like a lot. I include them here because they can be house ruled for this game too:
-> When you found a new city, you decide the resource it provides (pay 3 different resorces, as always, plus 1 coin for every neighbouring city producing this same resource).
-> 6 different technologies (6 are too few for many players, but I'm not convinced level 2 of the land and sea movement are good for the game; I think it promotes blitzkrieg attacks to get the final points you need to win - to be confirmed with more gameplay)
-> Don't need an additional movement to conquer a city (entering a region is enough)
-> Movement of another player cannot be allowed if you have troops in that region (obvious in a 2 player game; I don't know if that would be good or bad in Antike; it does not happen often).

One idea to be tested: do not give coins each round, give them as reward for attacks/conquering cities.

First impression: Nice thing about this game is that it's very fast to play. Looks like civilization game but it's more of an optimization game after all.

Stripped down and rather analytical Civilisation game without the trading or the need to devote a whole day to a single game. The rondel is an excellent mechanism, which not only adds an extra tactical dimension, but also focuses and balances play. The doubled sided board allows you to play either Western or Eastern civilisations and adds replayability. (8.5)

Bellissimo gioco in stile Civilization ma dalla durata accettabile. Carina l'ambientazione e i personaggi storici riproposti. Immancabile il meccanismo a Rondella di Mac Gerdts.

RATING: 8
Ha! Yes. This works. I almost certainly got it the wrong way round playing this game after Hamburgum, where the same rondel mechanic is used in a much more cuddly way. Antike is super-confrontational, deliciously open, and capable of accelerating into chaos, particularly with a balanced quotient of four. Perhaps it's a little too easy, with more, to become marginalised.

Extremely satisfying civ-building game. The rondel forces you to choose the action you MOST desire rather than enabling you to do all of the ones you really want to do. This creates quite a bit of tension on each turn as you agonize over your move.

I have read that the game might be improved if the victory condition were 1 less VP, and this sounds like a good suggestion. 

An interesting game that can get a bit shouty and tense if players take things personally- i.e. it has elements of Diplomacy. So, pick your group carefully. YMMV, I won't play it with some people, while I'd love to play with others.

Well, yeah... The game is no doubt satisfying for an occasional play. However, Mac Gerdt's IMPERIAL games are just more straight forward and to the point compared to Antike. Book keeping could have easily been implemented in a more intuitive way (currenmt production values marked by pawns on a track, like in TtA, for example), and those coins come too frequently and are too valuable, thus decreasing the need for resources and the incentive to adapt your tactics. The tech tree is rudimentary and doesn't give you the impression of technological progress. The whole thing doesn't really feel like a light Civilization game, but more like a very light war game.

I really like the Rondel, which is indicative of how well thought-out this game is. Plays smoothly and quickly, is easy to grasp, and intriguing. 

If I had one preference it would have been that the starting civilizations have varying strengths, rather than all the same attributes, but it appears the designer decided to concentrate on the 'game' aspect of this effort, and I respect that choice. So, that's a minor criticism, as is my wish that the battle system allowed for some random element, so that an underdog could win at times. 

"Antike" does have many potential strategies, plus a double-sided board of the Eastern and Western world of ancient history. For what the designer intended it to be, it's virtually a perfect rendition, as rules are minimal, but it absolutely elegant to play, as even though there is much to consider, moves can be made quickly, especially using the Rondel. 

I love all the great wooden bits, too: The game is absolutely beautiful to behold once set up and played; I've even take photos of my final board positions at the end of a contest. 

The rule book is also one of the best written and illustrated I have seen. As regards best number of players, more is better, as the game and its strategic options really shine with a more crowded board: with 3, for instance, I found it too easy to move around and claim large chunks of territory before competing civilizations had to vie over territory. Purchased used, October 2008.

It's pretty good.  Good flow to the game.  It offers a nice civilization building theme with clear simple rules.

Minor complaint is actually over the LACK of randomness in combat.  The end of the game gets a bit stuffy when people start looking to see exactly what needs to be done.  Plus I think I just like rolling some dice in battle. :)

Great game. Very clever. I think the Rondel works better here than it does in Imperial, because in Imperial there are two strong spaces, so you want to whizz round as fast as you can. 

In Antike you feel like you want to visit every space, or almost every space (though it is best not to). The tension is higher because you are 100% invested in one country. There are multiple paths to victory, which is remeniscant of Settlers (the best thing about Settlers is the multiple paths to victory).

It is definitely Civilization "Lite"! The rules can be explained in 10 minutes and setup time is 1 minute. It has the Civilization feeling, but can easily be played in 2 hours. It may be somewhat too much streamlined but before I can make a final decission on it I have to play it much much more. I like the fact, that the board is doublesided and that each round is going very quick. Downtime even with 6 players is minimal, because each possible move can most of the time be planned during the others turn and can be done in a few seconds. The only exception is when in the late game the people start to invade enemy territory, then the handling of the various troops can become a little fiddly and slow. I never thought this could happen but as the game was over after 2 hours we all agreed on a second match immediatly!Update: Now I have finally lowered my vote. This game doesn't get to much replay: Mainly because as someone must start with the romans, this player gets the biggest disadvantage. Still this game is VERY good. 8 may be my final voting.

RATING: 7
Based on one play: You chose an action based on the rondel and then grow your army to move into new locations. This will in turn give you more resources, however points are acquired for specific objectives so ensure to keep those in mind. Also don't fall to far behind and try to jump a few points for the win otherwise you may get attacked by everyone.

I realized how much I like this game before the first round of actions was expired.  I like how players are forced to score in multiple ways, but can select their own timing to a degree.  A worthy successor in the 'lightweight civ' category if you take it for what it is.  Recommended.

Tre ore che volano via grazie a regole e meccaniche davvero semplici (su tutto la "ruota" con i turni). Il gioco impedisce di focalizzare la strategia su una sola dottrina granitica, delle 5 che ti fanno guadagnar punti. Sei costretto a fondere il Mahatma Gandhi con Gengis Khan, i Vulcaniani con gli Unni. Da rigiocare in sei: con quattro giocatori gli spazi aperti facilitano strategie attendiste, e gli scontri arrivano alla fine.

RATING: 5
As a dudes-on-a-map game, I'm already not favorably inclined toward Antike, but I think this game has some very serious flaws.  This is a victory point game that's based on fulfilling certain achievements, and while multiple people can get each one, they do run out before everyone can get there.  So if you're a little behind the curve, you get left out of points that would be easy to achieve.  Some starting positions are better than others because they provide more access to water, and one of the achievements is for building a large fleet (there is no corresponding achievement for armies, and the two are otherwise equivalent).  Conquest-based achievements are particularly hard to fulfill, as an opponent has to build a temple that's accessible to your forces, and the movement/conquest rules force you to telescope your intentions, giving the defender lots of time to react (also, there are large defensive bonuses and no offensive bonuses).  By the end of the game, it's very difficult for even the leader to score the last achievement or two, while all the other players are forced to stop him, being practically out of the running themselves.  Not a good experience.

An excellent game, which I am always keen to play. The 'rondel' mechanic is one I haven't seen used elsewhere, and makes the game move surprisingly quickly (although I would prefer it to be a fixed length - the end game can drag out a bit). Generally takes a few hours to play, and a relatively high level of planning is required to make the most of it, so not best for lighter gamers. Still, I would always take any opportunity to get this one out.

10/9/06 Purchased from Thoughthammer. Initial review of board and rules has me !!. 10/12 - played 4p solitare, and I got the same feeling I did with Mare Nostrum: cool. I like how "clean" it all is, and how quickly turns will move. Will likely have less player interaction that MN, with no trading of resources. I love the "law of diminishing returns" aspect of Antike. 1-5-10 Traded with Attika and Goa for Command & Colors: Ancients, and ?

2014: I played this a couple of times with my Dad and brother. I don't remember exactly why we didn't like it - but it fell flat for us. I love the artwork, the pieces, the board (I am a Trading in the Mediterranean guy). But the game just didn't do anything for us. I probably should rate this a [4], but the components, theme, and novelty of the rondel mechanic would get me to play it if someone asked me. But that has about a 0% chance of ever happening.

TRY Sept/06: Fun & interesting game, with varied paths to victory.  However, it never felt to me like there was sufficient reason to attack someone's territory, unless it was to destroy a temple (and get a card for it).  This took away from the military aspect somewhat, I think, and resulted in Risk-like army accumulations and defensive builtups.

A tense game that involves a lot of foresight and is well balanced.  The game is fun and engaging from the get go, but as armies build up and victory lies in the destruction of temples, the endgame (those final two or three points) takes a bit too long.  Still, it's very fun and very tense.  I enjoy the "rondell" mechanic, and I like how temples are both incredibly powerful and yet magnets for destruction. If it took an hour and a half instead of 2+, I'd give it an 8.  As it stands, it's still a fine game.

This was a lot of fun, then started to feel formulaic and is now starting to reveal a little more depth again.

A stripped-down war/civilization game.  Awesome.  I think it would work best with 5-6, lots of diplomacy/negotiation required to succeed.  Plenty of things to do between turns, which are very short to begin with.  Sooo much better than Mare Nostrum, not as good as Wallenstein.  This game is NOT meant for 3-players, even with the author's variants.

Civ building meets simplicity.  No dice, no randomness at all with this game.  Loads of components, seats 6, can play with 2.  Was it short?  No, not really.  Unless you have a pile of people who are going for the jugular, nations could stalemate.  I love this game, though.  The Rondel is a really neat mechanism that works very well.  I don't see how you can win without combat, though, so you really ought to plan for it.

First play with 5 and the board becomes "busy" as the session progresses and I agreed with one player's comment that he couldn't be bothered working stuff out when it came to decision time. (So 4 players maybe better). I like the experience that you can "peacefully" develop your empires, along various avenues to collect the victory points, such as occupying 7 seas, 5 cities, build 3 temples etc. More importantly, once you claim a vp card it can never be taken from you, so the game will end. But the game seems to be programmed that conflict will be inevitable, and this is where things become confusing: combat is diceless as in Vinci, and there are empire value modifiers (via development)for defence and overcoming marching fatigue. I was apathetic to this, so pursed a peaceful path, but some players may want some action. Combat is dry, and can result in the Steve Bradbury effect, in weaking combatants will allow a third to pull through for the win. The rondel makes for quick and interesting angst, and I like the freebie "wild" coin and the flavour of the vp cards. But since taking a stronger interest in history, I too would like to see a civ game capturing the unique empire qualities/geography etc.

RATING: 8

An engaging conquest game with some similarities to Vinci and Empires of the Ancient World. Those temples! They can make AND break you. The cliché, "location, location, location" couldn't have been more appropriate than in relation to these temples.  The dichotomy of 'temples' is supreme in this game. You need to build temples in order to win the game, but owning temples make you a target of attacks, since your temples are victory points to your opponents!

One potentially major problem I can envision with Antike is the way it can slow down towards the end when players are struggling for their last one or two victory points. I think the game can drag on for long stretches of time with minimal progress or change.

This is a tentative rating after two plays. A couple more plays are needed to digest the strategies of and potential issues with the game. But I still enjoyed both my games (the first time at BGG.CON, Nov. 3-6, 2005.)
Update 03/05/06. Increased my rating from 7.5 to 8.

An interesting game that falls into the civ-building family. Other than starting location, all of the civilizations are identical. Far superior to goofy Mare Nostrum (I still cannot believe that MN game required 20 years to design and ended up so dull.) Tension builds as the game develops. It would have been a better game if the civs were not identical but it is not a bad game as it is.

Normally I would have given this a higher rating but had to drop it based on a recent play.

First, the turn order problem is a HUGE weakness and design flaw. First player wins a disproportionate amount of times according to other geeks. This makes sense if everyone is grabbing victory points at the same pace.

Second, this was the author's first rondell game and I think he has improved with his most recent designs, namely Navigador is a superior game in my opinion and I would prefer to play that.

Third, the combat is messy for city captures (another design weakness). And I personally don't care for the one for one exchange during combat. I prefer a variant where we rolled some dice in addition to troops, which I think made the game better.

An excellent game of civilization in a reasonably time.  (Can be played in one evening.)

There are many different ways of playing.  You need to be flexible and change your strategy as the game evolves, and keep your eye on the goal of the number of key people cards needed to win.

Nicely balanced game with 5 different criteria for winning the key people cards which gives thousands of ways to play and win.

RATING: 7
Was a bit disappointed. 

The rondel is nice mechanism to limit which actions are readily available.
 
Just found the game play with the deterministic combat to be dry. Looks to be scripted - the only successful strategy I've seen is marble early (get production going), gold middle (grab some tech points), Iron late (get the final point via expansion). Almost any other way puts you either behind the production curve or the tech points curve. 

Deciding where and when to attack is a pure math affair. Getting attacked doesn't look as bad as it first appears (once you get a card you can't lose it), and the bleeding for 2 sides sets up a third to come in and stomp both. Being one of the center powers like in Civ is tough. 

However that is a result of a purely deterministic system. So if you like to lay your plans and never see them go awry this is for you, if you like to take chances - pass of this one.

While it plays fast there are better civilization games (Conquest of Paradise, Vinci, old Civ itself).  

BTW I Played Imperial first and found it to be a much superior game.

27/12/2007: Had my first game of Antike today. The rondel system is pretty challenging, since it does provide some limit to your options if you cannot afford to pay resources to move further down the wheel. There seems to be a dominant strategy at the start of the game, which is to race to obtain a majority of temples from the limited supply. From then on, players' strategies will noticeably deviate based on the gameplay situation.

RATING: 9
Played about half a dozen times now, and I love it.  

Antike is a great game.  The fact that it takes 5 minutes to explain and two hours to play is a plus point.

With this section of the market already overcrowded with entries like Mare Nostrum and Serenissima, I would rate Antike far higher than the competition.

What I particularly liked was not just that there were multiple paths to the victory points, and multiple paths to the resources that would take you up those paths, but the way that the game neither encouraged nor discouraged conflict - and the effect on the players involved was not catastrophic either. 

I'd also say that it was medium weight, as it was a very simple system; perhaps unique amongst this sort of game, the turns moved very quickly indeed, sometimes taking just a few moments for each player in the rounds where people were developing their positions.  

The three-player game works FINE when played to 10VPs, the six-player game is also great (but a bit short), and a military strategy is viable WHATEVER the number of players.  Top game.

RATING: 3
Rating based on playing with 6 players, which I've done twice: I will NEVER play it again with 6 players. If I ever play it with less, I will adjust the rating to average it out based on my new experience. Eliminates the luck factor of Risk yet retains the same flavor of player interaction.  Problem with a 6-player game is that two players get royally ripped and four get nice safe corners from which to build, because UNLIKE Risk, there are no 'choke points' for protection in the middle of the board, leaving two people to play the lambs circled by a pack of wolves.  Substantial changes to the map would tend to even this out greatly.  (Hint: not EVERY war game has to be based on the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.) Ignoring that, the game has a wonderful mechanism to make growing and defending an empire challengingly complex and varied.  I expect to play this one with 4 players or less some time. Totally aside from number of players, it can be a pain, and drag on a long time if everyone analyzes every aspect of their move before actually moving, which is (unfortunately, in my opinion) possible in this game. Due to the luck factor being eliminated, the endgame becomes an exercise in solving a perfectly solvable mathematical puzzle -- more than a war game -- and thus detracts a great deal from my potential for enjoyment (despite my appreciation for some mathematical puzzles).

Rondel-powered european civilisation game, played once at Wellycon.  I would pick Imperial over this, but for a clearer battle between players this may be your pick.

RATING: 7
My most randomless game by far. It's a bit like multiplayer chess played on the map of Europe/Mesopotamia. I like this game very much, but, for once, the lack of a random element makes this game drag at bits. Still very enjoyable as a wargame nonethless.

RATING: 9
wow, what a fantastic civ building game. the rondel is an awesome way to manage players' options--it keeps players nations from exponentially growing beyond the ability of other players to react, and the choice of what action to take on a players turn is usually a really dificult and interesting one. i only wish there were more personalities for players to pursue. after a few plays, i think that the game might start to feel repetitive, but i can't say for sure without playing more. for right now though, if i'm in the mood for a civ game, it's likely going to be antike that i want to play. oh, also try going for generals early, if you can. that way, you can try to stay out of the end game blood-letting.

RATING: 8
Civiliasation building game with no luck element. Millitary expansion is not the key to success and conflict is expensive unit wise so you have to chose carefully who you attack and when. The resources are equally distributed over the map so you always have access to all the resource without any problems. It might be more interesting if it was no so equally distributed. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
While civ games still leave me twiddling my thumbs, Antike seems to improve things ever so slightly. At least it's quick and there's a nice feel of expansion and control to it.

I find the diceless combat incredibly annoying, however, and the end game is anti-climactic. And there's not a lot of really tough decisions here. I can see why many people love this, but civ games will continue to remain on the outer for me. If I HAD to play one, I guess this would be it.

I would say that Antike does a great job of being a civ light game.  It was much lighter than I was expecting it to be, but I can see how it could get heavier with more players. (I played with three.)  The only phase that takes any time is the manouver phase, and it would be longer with more players because there is more to consider.  I really like that they included a tech tree (perhaps it should be called a tech bush because it is so short). Along those lines, Gerdts incorporated many different civ elements into a game with a fairly quick play time (obviously longer than Roll Through the Ages, but it seemed sorter than La Citta one of the only other civ-light style games I have played). I like Antike a lot and would recommend it to anyone looking for a civ style game that can be played in an hour and a half.

(Rated 9 after one play)

***Update***

Changed my rating to eight after comparing how much I enjoy Antike to how much I enjoy other games rated 9.  I certainly enjoy it less so I've now got it rated 8.

RATING: 8
Easy to learn, plenty of options, interesting mechanics, little downtime, game length feels exactly right. The rondel mechanic makes it sparkle! I suspect, from my own plays and the reports of others, that four players is the sweet spot. It's a great game with six, but the two "middle" players may feel unfairly squeezed. With three players it is more like solitaire: too much room to expand without much need for player interaction. I'll try it soon with two, which can be done either with each player taking two civilizations, or by playing on just half the board.

RATING: 9.2
Antike is a challenging strategy game about evolution and competition among ancient civilizations. Ancient nations create cities, build temples, sail the seas, and discover new principles of science and technology. Their legions and galleys open new settlements and defend their people against attacks from their enemies. Two scenarios can be chosen as the game board is two-sided. Players choose from Greeks, Romans, and Germanic tribes and Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Persians, Arabs, Egyptians, and Babylonians.

Every nation tries to win ancient kings, scholars, generals, citizens, and navigators for themselves. The nation that acquires a specified number (depending on the number of players) ancient personalities first will win the game!

Lead one of these nations to victory! But watch out for your enemies, as they will want to conquer your cities to destroy your temples. The game depends not on the luck of dice or cards, but on thoughtful plans and skillful diplomacy.

Only downside really is that it can seem to drag on a little towards the end and people tend to gang up on someone they don't like (me usually).  Highly recommended for those wanting an elegant, simple, yet deep, civ, economic, war game with no luck.

Played a 4P game on the English side of the map the other day, and it seemed to be a sort of cold war strategy of hoarding armies until they were almost all built before you'd have to strike. Although I enjoyed the game play, this was a bit of a disappointment.
I hope to play this game again soon to see if other strategies will apply as well...

I love civilization games and also the Rondell action selection mechanic that this game employs. There are some agonizing decisions to be made each turn as you choose which action to take and try to get your timing right with respect to what other players are doing.

Dislikes
I hate that Antike is a basically a race for VP. I like my civ games a bit more ponderous and Antike plays too frenetically for my sensibilities as a civ game. Too much focus is on being the first to make progress not because it advances your civilization but purely for the victory points awarded. To me, it doesn't fit well with the civ theme.

RATING: 6
A good Euro with all the pluses & minuses that that implies. Plus - Plays quickly, simple to learn, play not completely duh, slick mechanics. Minus - contrived, pasted on theme (although far from the worst example of that), shallow, ultimately sterile and mechanical. Oh, and the combat system is rancid.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Resource management in what should be a quick playing game.  Nice ability to play different numbers of players.  VP's once gained are never lost, so game progresses towards an end.  Conflict is a bit pricey and if poorly timed allows others to sweep in behind the attacking force.  Fortunately, conflict is a part, not the whole of the game.  With limited actions per turn, game play is very quick even with large numbers of players minimizing downtime.  But still key decisions to be made when it is time to take a turn.  And if the game continues to play in about 2 hours - happy with the current rating......But more recently, the games seems to be balanced during play to the point where the eventual winner must be decided by that costly combat system (sacking temples) as the other VPs are no longer available.  This results in a drawn out conclusion to the game that really feels inefficient compared to the earlier turns.  If this style of play continues, rating likely to go down to a 6 or 5 as the game just doesn't feel right when played for such a lengthy time.

RATING: 8
A fun game that is part civilization, part territory control, and part war game.  A blend of eurogame and ameritrash; it has an immersive feeling of theme, but the mechanisms are just abstract enough that it's playable in a couple of hours.  The first act can be simultaneous solitaire, then in the second act you start testing each others' limits and tolerances.  Unfortunately, the third act can bog down while everyone struggles for that last victory point.  As a result, laggards can catch up and it becomes a simultaneous struggle for victory.  Then suddenly, someone achieves it.

--Feb2006-- Cool logistics game, with combat for added chaos.  In that respect, it's vaguely reminiscent of Serenissima, save that the mechanics are much cleaner (and the endgame _way_ better designed.)

(And yet I've soured on it a bit after a rather turgid play.  Probably ok if one is careful with the opponents; but that's true of a lot of games.)

After playing this a bunch more, I gotta say this game is great.  I love how the battles start to develop as the board fills up organically.  Suffers a bit from unintentional king-maker, as who's next to who matters.  But overall it's pretty fun with a few main strategies to win.

RATING: 7
Very enjoyable. It was exactly what I hoped it would be: a game with a little more depth than Settlers of Catan, which my family would nevertheless be able to play. The Rondel is a great engine driving the game. Unlike Settlers, where you can sometimes find that you cannot do anything for long stretches because of the unlucky dice rolls, you will always be able to collect and spend resources.

Before playing it I was put off by the supposed lack of interaction at the beginning of the game and the punishing combat rules. Neither of these turned out to be a problem. It is not a game of war or diplomacy, but rather of construction and development. Only a few attacks should take place during the game as you should only attack if you are going to get a concrete benefit (normally a victory card). Certainly, a full-blown war will only weaken the two players involved to the benefit of a third; however, this is not a disadvantage, but rather a feature of the game, channelling the activity of the players towards peaceful expansion and development.

A streamlined civ/empire building game.  Its greatest strength is the time of play is much shorter than, say, Civilization.  However, you lose a lot of theme with the reduced game play.  The rondel is novel and innovative.  This is a solid game and a must for fans civ/empire builders (especially those who do not want to spend 3-8 hours creating then destroying an empire).

Another fantastic MacGerdts game. Balanced, ingenious mechanics, pushes you in the right feeling for taking over the whole map. The fact that every player is doing his turn very quickly means fast rounds ... and that is cool for such a game.

I didn't really warm to this. I did as badly as on my first games of Imperial and Imperial 2030, but I didn't experience that desire to have another go to try and get it right. Maybe just because it is a similar game, and I can only take so much hammering. Wouldn't turn down a game, though.

RATING: 7
The rondel is a very clever element that in addition to keeping the game ticking along at a good clip also acts as an indicator as to what moves your opponents are likely to make and what's possible for them to do. I like it that once earned the cards are not lost. The game is very elegant and I'm glad it wasn't cluttered with unnecessary rules and exceptions. Players have to keep a careful balance and all share the points cards around evenly - especially the development cards. Plays a bit slow with three - as a bonus the game plays well with six. I look forward to bringing this out often.

Good lighter civ game.  I really like that action choice rondel mechanism.  Nice in that there doesn't have to be a much conflict in the first half of the game, but when the board fills up, there has to be conflict.  All excellent production value, although rules could be a little tighter.

I liked this a lot more with six players than three because there was a little less look-ahead.  With three, you need to balance every move against what the other players will gain from it.  With more, it feels more like an epic game, even though it plays in about the same amount of time.

I really enjoy this game - the flow and the development. Build a world-shaking empire from next to nothing in around two hours. Simple but strategic, fun and fast-paced (down-time not a problem).

Further update (10/10): I haven't played this in years, played last night, it's a really good game! But it's got a lot of direct smash-faciness that I'm usually pretty bad at and don't like. I managed to win, despite starting in the center of a 5p game, and despite being the only one to really be attacked ever.

One of my favorite games, sadly rather hard to set up a game due to how long it takes. Very nice mix of strategies, requires planning in advance, some diplomacy depending on the number of players. Rondel mechanic is great, nearly complete lack of randomness even better.
Most of the game (until late-game maneuver turns) it also progresses rapidly, little downtime.

One thing I don't like is how the game dynamic completely changes depending on number of players. 3 players - barely any interactions and very limited strategy, 4 players almost always devolves into 2 vs 2, 5 players is probably the optimal number and 6 (only one play with 6) is more chaotic with many attacks all around the board.
Could have balanced this better...

Feels like an old-fashioned Euro game. It is a civilization game (a genre I love) but does not give the same feeling of building a civilization that Through the Ages, Nations, or even 7 Wonders does. That said, it's still a good cube-pushing-type game with somewhat of a civilization building theme.

A very original action/role mechanism. However, I feel that combat is nearly crippled because of the heavy cost, and the game can grind to a halt at the end--or else someone can jump to sudden victory. A game desperately in need of a developer.

[1 play] Well, one abbreviated play with 6 players, but easily enough to get a good feel for the game (I have played Imperial several times).

I am looking forward to playing this again. The standard routine is solid, the card collection objectives for victory is a nice system to keep the game from bogging down with endless combat, and the technology grid is clever. I'm very pleased with this game in my initial impression, despite the fact that I believe it would be a better game with less than 6 players.

The Rondel actions is remniscent of Neuland. Very innovative and makes makes the decisions run fairly fast.

However, I have issues with a full 6player game. The board gets crowded and sometime it boils down to a few large battles at the end.

Lots to like but would be great if 30-45 minutes could be shaved off playtime.

Good production values. Loads of wooden bits and also english rules!

Really enjoy the Rondel, it makes the turns go quickly making little downtime. There is a turtling problem though, most people don't do military until everyone has to and then the game drags.

There are nice level of player interaction, planning a head and good tactical movement in this game.  You feel like you are playing game that should last much longer, but it fits within 2 hours.. and one of the best feature is that your turn comes around so quickly even with 6!!

Antike is easy to learn and explain to others, and there are a variety of different strategies to try. It's more abstracted than Mare Nostrum, but the design is cleaner. Antike will appeal to Eurogamers, whereas Mare Nostrum will appeal to Amerigamers. Because of the way you earn victory points, Antike often feels more like a "race game" than a civ game. It has very little downtime, but it sometimes drags in the endgame, especially if you have no chance to win.

RATING: 7.5
This isn't a bad game, but I find Imperial to be much better.  There's too much screwage here, since every player is tied to one nation.  In Imperial the leading investor controls a nation during its turn, but you aren't tied to its fate nearly as much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Has a nice build up to conflict, but since the combat is so pat the actual fighting is a bit anticlimatic.  Rating could easily go up or down depending on replayability, especially concerning whether all the different stategies are viable (temples vs. tech vs. warmongering).  REQUIRES discipline to keep the game moving along.  I don't see a comparison to Civilization since there is no trading.  Definitely some good opportunities for diplomacy.

UPDATE-I raised my rating a point due to consistently fun and interesting play (with 6 people) and reports that it even works well with two.  The endgame can be a bit strange even as it gets more fun (a free-for-all of temple attacks), but so far I don't mind it much.

Very nice resource management game with a good civilization development feel. The action selection system is brilliant, and the game moves quickly until someone with a huge army and/or navy chooses the maneuver option. Combat is so bloody, though, that it should generally be avoided unless you are swimming in iron, or need  one or two quick cards to win the game. I really enjoyed my one play of this, and all of the players kept pace with one another in terms of personality cards, despite pursuing radically different strategies.

RATING: 4
I think it is ok with 4 or 3 players. But with 5 players, the players that start at corner has better chance to win. Once two nations are at war which technically no chance to win for both, the other will win eventually. The worse part is those losing factions need to wait till the game to finish.

Played just one game so far but really liked it. It reminded me of a kind of Sid Meiers Civ only less complex and much faster to play. Consequently it'll likely get a lot of play at our place as Niki likes quicker games. Unlike some resource games such as Settlers which rely on a bit of dice luck (of which I have none) this gave you resources according to your choices. Even combat was simple and effective. Super game, good show!

Played it again, love the simple mechanics, upped the rating accordingly.

Az első rondellás játék a szerzőtől. Ebben az ókori civilizációk vezetését veszik át a játékosok, városokat, templomokat építenek, ezekből vasat, márványt és aranyat szereznek amikből fejlődhetnek, illetve sereget toborozhatnak. A játék célja az 5 fajta személyiségkártyákból a játékosszámtól függő darab elérése. Ezek adott számú tengeri hódításért, templomépítésért, fejlettségért, városszámért és az ellenség templomainak lerombolásáért járnak. Tetszett, hogy egy személyiségkártya elnyerése után már nem lehet elveszíteni. Szép a játék kivitele, nagyon sok faalkatrész tartozik hozzá. A játékmenet is kellemes, de például nem nagyon éreztem a játék során, hogy érdemes lenne bármilyen lépést is kihagyni a rondellán, illetve bármikor is fizetni azért, hogy többet léphessek az alap 3-nál. Ennél a játéknál is azt éreztem, mindenre menni a legjobb, egysíkú stratégia meglepne ha győzelemre vezetne, de örülnék ha későbbi játékok rám cáfolnának. Az általam eddig próbált másik rondellás Imperial 2030-at hozzám közelebb állónak tartom. Ott is van legalább ennyi konfrontáció mint ebben, sőt lehet még több, de kevésbé nyíltan jelenik meg. Az Antike jó játék, nem is igazán tudok hibát találni benne. A játék talán elnyúlhat és talán páros számúan jó igazán játszani vele, bár hatan talán belassul, de mindenképpen egy korrekt darab.

A "Civ" style game. I definitely prefer it with more players. There is a little more combat/conflict than I prefer, but the mechanics (especially the Rondel) are rock solid.
Edit: I've adjusted my rating down a point because on further plays it has gotten a little repetitive. Whoever gets the early research personalities tends to win, unless all the other players know to beat that player down aggressively.

I love the rondel!  Really.  That thing is awesome.  The way that the movement around the wheel works is such that you always want to be where you cannot be.  Perfectly, angst entrenched.
 
This is a great civ building game.  I love the number of different goals that you can go for in the game.  This keeps your options open and a flexible player can always find a way to keep themselves in the game.  The use of coins as a universal currency gives players the feeling that everything they do is based on their own decisions, and they are not just trapped by the constraints of the game. 

The victory point system should appeal to many euro-gamers as you won't always need to fight to win, and the game system succumb to bashing the leader.  Neither one of these things bother me, but it means that I can play this with more people.  In this game the threat of attack may be more effective than attack itself.

I'm pleased that the map is double sided. This should allow for the game to feel fresh for a long time to come.

UPDATE: I don't recommend this game for 6 players.  The players in the middle are a bit screwed, which wouldn't be so awful, if there wasn't a deficit of VP's to overextend an stagnant, prolonged, anti-climactic ending.  When all players are doing fairly well, there is a dearth of choices available at game end as all the options for victory are tapped out.  While there are technically enough cards to go around, there just isn't enough incentive for the few who cannot possibly hope to achieve those conditions.  If you play with 6 players I highly recommend you play to 6 victory points.  With a 6 it gets ... a 6.

Update:  I still love the game and I am now convinced after many plays that there is just one too many VP's needed for the win for any number of players.  The last VP can add 30 to 45 minutes, it is nice in that this is usualy where people catch up, but often the struggle leaves one person as the spoiler.  The game already plays close to the bone, why offer less choices at the end...?

UPDATE: Use the official variant.  If you get all of your tech up you get a VP.

Blazing fast empire game. Too fast. My first eight to ten games, with a different mix of players, were great. My last three games, all with experienced players, have been insane racing games. The games barely have any resemblence to civ building any more. It's a mad grab for victory points. Unless you are sacking a temple, forget fighting. It's like running the 400 meters and two of the runners decide to get in a fistfight. They will be left far behind.

This game fell a little flat for me. It felt like it ended too early for my taste and there wasn't much interaction at all with takeover of lands. Odd for a 5 player game. Only two or three conflicts happened and before I could get my swerve on, it ended. Would like to try again but not with the VP-1 variant we played.

RATING: 6
Fun and fast playing. Warfare seems to be a losing-option for all involved--which is discouraging if one of your neighbors decides he just wants to attack you. Board position in few-player games also seems to be very important.

I've not yet found the sweet-spot of this game. I think warfare needs to give benefits for outnumbering your opponent. And I'm beginning to think that it might be good if, each space you want to advance on the Rondel beyond the free three spaces, should cost you not one coin/supply but a number of coins/supplies equal to your current victory point total.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed the large board, the theme and the bits from this game.  However, I disliked the race element to it, and it seems a little difficult to stop someone from winning.  I think this would be best played with 4 or 5 than with 3, however.  Still, this rating might be a touch low, and I do like that there are multiple paths to victory.

My first game featuring the rondel mechanic. Some call Antike Civ-Lite, to which I have to agree to an extent. I like the deterministic combat - it is expensive to wage war, as in real life, and there are often better avenues to victory (how very Euro).

RATING: 8
This is a fast-paced and fairly simple building/conquest game that plays in under 2 hours.  It's like Vinci but with more to it.  Works best if people don't take too long and if you only have 4 players.  Three is a little slow, and 5-6 gets too crowded.

RATING: 7
This is NOT a civilization game so much as an empire-building game with some civ-like themes. 

The 2-sided map allows you to play in 2 different settings. Each side shows a number of land and sea regions. All land regions have a city site of 1 of 3 types: if you build a city there, you will be able to generate that resource (marble, iron, or gold). Players start in defined areas, depending on the # playing, controlling 3 cities (1 of each type). The board also shows a Rondel - the defining feature of the game (below). 

At the start of each round, everyone gets a coin (which can be used as any of the other 3 resources). Then, on your turn, you choose your action from the Rondel. This is a circle divided into 8 wedges, 1 for each of the types of action. You may move your token clockwise only; up to 3 spaces for free, then each additional space costs a resource. Actions include:
- 3 production actions (iron, gold, or marble): every city you built of the appropriate type produces 1 of that resource (subject to modifications; temples and some knowledge advances improve production)
- 3 resource-using actions (arming, uses 1 iron/token produced; know-how, uses gold to discover 1 of 8 areas of knowledge; temple building, uses 5 marble/temple)
- 2 maneuver actions (allows ship/legion movement and combat). Every unit has 1 movement point initially; knowledge advances will increase this. Combat only occurs if either player decides not to coexist peacefully, and is very simple -- 1:1 removal of units till only 1 side is left. Conquering a city requires 1 move point.
After action is taken, you may spend 1 of each resource per city you'd like to build (1 per empty city site).

The game ends when a defined VP total is reached (varies with #players). VP are earned by:
- building cities (every 5th --> 1VP)
- building temples (every 3rd --> 1VP)
- building a navy (1VP / 7 sea areas containing your ships)
- know-how (if you're the first to discover 1 of the 8 areas --> 1VP)
- destroying temples (1VP/temple)
There is a limited # of VP available in each of these areas.

The Rondel is very nice - with only 1 thing to do on your turn, things should move quickly. Should - our first game with 6newbies took for EVER! But I need to play some more - not sure how fun this really is -- a 7 may be a bit generous.

We could say that this game has two parts: civilization and fighting.
First of all we have to build a strong civilization. After that, and trying to get your last victory points, you are almost obliged to fight.
I have to say that this is a very clever game with clever mechanics and a very well balanced victory condition.
I think I like it better with four than with five.
First rondel series game. It seems to have some balance issues. Not all of the civilizations seem to have the same possibilities to win. I think that Greeks and Arabs are more comfortable on the map an have more time to strength themselves and prepare to the fights. Middle civilizations are more targeted because they naturally occupy strategic positions on the map.

Haven't played it that often but it appears to me that development vp's are key to success. No player should be allowed to get more than 2 of these vp's not only because they are easier to get but also because they actually improve our civilizations making them stronger.

RATING: 9
An excellent game that is less of a conquest game than it looks. On the first try, everyone makes the mistake of thinking that the goal is to conquer the map, and each faction gets into a cold war-like game of arming before losing all its units attacking territories and desperately trying to hold them. It's just the wrong way... 

Keep your eye on the cards, don't try to conquer the entire map !

Pros: 
- Each turn goes very fast.
- Nicely balanced.
- Many different ways to victory
- Keeps you on the edge, with a lot of ways of stealing the win at the very end.

CONS:
- Longer than advertised, and might drag a bit.
- NOT a real conquest game, despite the fact that many players want it to be. Armies can at best defend and steal a temple or two. It's not really a flaw, it's just that the game has a deceiving nature...
- Central player has a clear disadvantage, and no one will persuade me of the contrary. Since it pays to get a temple or two, the central player has just more chances of being the target of the other players.

Overall, a very pleasant experience.

Georgeous looking game. Looking forward to first outing. First game was a two player, and this is not the way to enjoy a first play, there is too much going on playing 2 civs. Despite, the brain burn i think and with only one empire to manage, i will enjoy Antike. The Rondel is a stroke of genius, it adds both simplicity and depth to the game play. 

After a few plays i find my rating going down - the 'Look! he's going to win lets gang up on him' makes the end game (which can be underwhelming)  not as much fun as beginning and middle

However, it is an excellent 'gateway game' for Axis & allies risk players and whilst i don't want to play it with gamers i find it very popular with new players

Good game, I love the rondel mechanism and the gameplay is easy to learn but very strategic.  Update: Is the game all about race to get know-how points as fast as possible?

way better than it's cousin Imperial, i felt there were more relevant choices going on in this one... my only complaint is that i think the temples are too hard to demolish, also the tightness of the endgame and struggle to get that last point makes it bog down some --- overall not my ideal choice for a game, but at least tolerable

This is very similar in feel to Imperial which shares the Rondel, designer, and luckless combat.  I liked the system and the game was good fun, but I didn't care for the victory conditions.  It seems the victory conditions are almost forced on you and you have to play "non-optimally" in order to achieve the conditions.  I know it sounds funny, but it almost felt like jumping through hoops instead of playing the game.  All in all, I really did enjoy it, but those damn victory conditions have peeved me enough to gripe about it.

A very abstracted civ-building game.  Better with plenty of players (5 or 6); the multiplayer chaos and diplomacy mitigate the perfect-information action optimization.  Definitely a good time.

Rating after one play. Very interesting, I felt there were lots of choices and paths for victory. Looking forward to playing this more. Seems like I could probably introduce to this to a wide variety of people, as the rules are not too heavy. Playing with only two people for the first game probably isn't the best choice, as it becomes hard to remember what the plan was for each color and the game slows down as you have to look the board over again before you choose an action for the turn. Yet, very enjoyable.

preliminary rating--played with 4 and it was great.  Next game will see even more tension, I'm sure, as the strategies-conversations are flying!  The rondel is a very very cool mechanic--makes everything fast and easy.  Once there are a number of armies to move around, it gets a little cumbersome tracking them, but not too bad.

Played with 3 the game moves extremely fast and is definitely more of a race-style game, than the diplomacy and conquer of 5 or even 4 players.  Still a great game.

Opinion has gone down slightly with more plays.  It just hasn't stayed as fun.

Figured it's "played-out" and it's now traded away, so someone else can enjoy it.

I like this one a lot, though it clearly doesn't work as well with 3 as with 4 or 5. It feels as though conquest should be a core part of the game, but it's comparatively so expensive that the incentives aren't there: I'm given to understand that it is quite typical for games to end with temple sackings because players don't go for those points until all other avenues are exhausted.

antike has absolutely no random elements & in my view suffers for it.  it can feel like everyone is basically doing the same things at the same rate with no tension or drama until later on.  it almost feels oversimplified-- like an expansion or two are needed to stir things up.

RATING: 5
[RGG 2006 edition] {Europe, civilization, economic; fighting; optimal 4-6p} Antike is very typical Euro gamers' game. It's multifaceted and provides tactics and strategies for players. It's luckless - no card, no dice. It has a tech tree but it's not the civilization game that I am looking for.

The design of the game is quite nice - simple and clean. Full of player interaction. It's not a conquest game - military is not the only way to achieve winning. It's balanced that no single winning condition or tech tree is overpowered. However, IMO, it's overly balanced, which makes the game quite dry and abstract. Besides, perfect information is an Achilles' heel of this game. I understand that it's designed to be luckless but this makes everything purely mathematic is very dry to me.

Antike has a crafted game system but I don't see much fun here. I would play Imperial instead, which is better themed.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
We played this too much like a "friendly" euro. I need to play again with a more conflict-oriented mindset. Some elements are very cool (the rondel) and others are tedious (the "wildcard" coin every turn). Here's hoping that multiple plays will reveal the gem that others are raving about.

Update: After playing this a second time I can see the potential, but it seems to be lacking that spark that makes a game really enjoyable. It certainly whets my appetite for Imperial.

Very good game for the first three quarters. In the end it totally falls apart, because players can only win by destroying temples of other players. That alone is not the problem. The problem (at least for me) is that in the endgame players have no intention of keeping their own empire unscathed, because they get no points for keeping it (unrealistic). Even worse, players actually have the intention to have their own empire destroyed by a third player just so that the competing player doesn't get the chance. Unreal.

A long awaited perfect response for all those Risk players that loved Empire building but yearned for much more strategy, no luck and all with hardly any more complexity.

The use of the rondel for determining and limiting actions is a sublimely brilliant idea. 

The only down side is that the game end can have an unsatisfying ending where someone sneaks a win before player's have time to react. Prefer to play with my variant of achieving a lower VP score but needing to hold on to the lead by the start of your next turn. Great for younger dudes 7 and up. Nearly as easy as Risk but with far more strategy and far less luck.
 
I can honestly see the Antike box getting worn out with use over the coming decades.

Based on only 1/2 a playing (we ran out of time and couldn't finish - not because the game is long but because of circumstances).  This is an excellent light civilization style game.

Still, it's very, very good.

Light civilization game with multiple routes to victory. You begin the game with a set number of regions each of which produces a different resource (iron, marble, gold). With the resources you can expand your military power, build temples (which increase a region's resource production), develop a technology or build a city as you colonize greater areas of the map. Choices are pretty straightforward and the technologies are very basic with only one progression form a starting technology to a second more powerful one. Victory is gained by accumulating a set number of cards, which are acquired through numerous ways e.g. conquering certain numbers of regions, building a certain number of temples, developing technologies first etc. Because their isn't one path to victory and you can combine various tactics the game is prevented from going stale with repeated plays and this game is a very good alternative to heavier and lengthier civilization games when available playing time is limited.

Wow.  That was really amazing.  I really enjoyed the action track and how you need to be really efficient.  I kept making mistakes and I really want to play again.  I think it may have the typical problem that if your neighbour goes crazy militaristic neither you or them can win.  

I would describe it as almost everything I love about Advanced Civilization and playable in 2 hours.  Antike is only missing trading and disasters. 2006/04/04

A good, very solid war-euro. It can be good as a gateway game. Simple rules and strong interaction. There is no luck involved, all the information is visible for all players, so you can always analyse the positions of all your opponents (it can be disadvantage for some people). 
The game can be divided into two parts: (a) development: inventing techs, founding new cities, buying temples and units, (b) short and intensive fight, where you try to gain the remaining VPs. For the first part, there are few combinations of optimal moves (with some variations), so when you are playing with experienced gamers, the core game is only part b.

Number of plays: 2.

Room for a lot of strategy. Great game, especially the wheel mechanic. Played with four players. It's not, in my opinion, a war game, but a civilization game. The best part is how the battles are resolved: plain and simple, without complex dice rules.

A kind of civilization game with the essential qualities of german mechanics. It can be too abstract for some players, probably it maybe more interesting developing some variants about characters cards.

Antike is a somewhat abstract civilization-building game.  I really like the rondel mechanism for taking actions, and I'd say the game is worth trying for that alone.  The late game can bog down into a situation where no one wants to make the first move; without that issue, I'd probably rate this game a 9 or 9.5.

Need to play this more. Seems to have three balanced strategies--no coyness: they're spelled out in the manual. The tech tree is small but balanced and useful. Simple to play. Whether it has staying power is the question. A modular map version would be interesting.

RATING: 8.5
Great mix of diplomacy, economy, and expansion.  It has enough historical feel to amuse me, but is clearly meant to be an abstraction.  The Rondel is a great idea, and the use of three simple resources works well.  Two sides of the map and flexible number of players should keep replay value high.  Antike and I are still in the "honeymoon" period, and I'll have to see how it ages, but I like everything so far.

RATING: 6.5
Units die in a 1-to-1 ratio so attacking is discouraged. But destroying temples gives you VP and is encouraged. But by the end of the game temples will probably have 5 defense, so it'll take a lot of troops to do this. Building all these troops on his border will alert your opponent and he'll build/move troops. So why do it? Well at that point all the other VP cards are probably taken. So you've got a Civ game that's build/develop your civ and then decide who's the winner by taking temples at the end of the game. What's the points of building/developing your civ then?

It also suffers from the problem where you can see someone is going to win a few turns ahead. This makes for a boring end to the game. (Ok, so I see that you're going to win, so I'll attack this other guys units because there's nothing else for me to complete before the game ends)

Think Euro-wargame. Lots of meeples and bits, no dice. This game is pretty fun even with 6, as the downtime between actions is very very small. A lot of folks indicate in session reports that the end game drags on - I think experienced players know better than to keep trying to build up forces - you simply have to make that one big push fast and the end game is over before anyone knows. Fighting in the mid-game doesn't typically do anything but benefit other players.

Played once as a two-player experience. At its heart, Antike is an elaboration on Risk. By adding timing and resource management via the rondel mechanic, the designer was able to add a great deal of interest to the basic formula of area control -- not least of which is a luckless combat system. Nonetheless, the game does seem to bog down in a pattern typical to Risk-like games. There is a tug of war between the players over border territories once all of the neutral areas are claimed. Eventually, one side gathers enough momentum to spread out enough to win; however, that slug-fest in the middle game can become tedious. What I do like is that turns are relatively quick, and that you can win by building infrastructure just as well as by conquest. I look forward to a 3+ player game.

UPDATE: I played again with 3. While there are some problems with the three-player experience (e.g., two players fight while the third runs away with the game), I was nonetheless impressed. The different strategies available are impressive. It's a Risk-like game that delivers a rewarding, Euro-style challenge. I think a four-player match would be superb. I'm upping my rating.

RATING: 8
This is a great game!  The players can build up peacefully, but in the end the last victory points must be taken by storm.  You can also skirmish with your neighbors throughout the game if you choose.  Troops die very easily, so there is a natural build up and die off rhythm to the game, and timing everything by wise use of the rondel is a lot of fun.

Antike es un juego de estrategia y evolución de civilizaciones antiguas: Grecia, Roma, Fenicia, Cartago, Persia, etc. Las naciones deben crear ciudades, templos, ejércitos y flotas, pero también deben descubrir nuevos principios de la ciencia y tecnología. El tablero de juego tiene dos caras para dos escenarios distintos. El juego no depende de la suerte de un dado o de las cartas, sino de tus planes y de la diplomacia. Es juego se la Serie Rondel (Navegador, Imperial, etc.)

The most popular 'civ building' game in our group. Where many others of this ilk have gone by the wayside, Antike has staying power. Great mix of army building and tech advancement, and of course the oft-mentioned rondel is a great way to keep things moving along. We play both maps equally. The endgame does indeed drag a bit as players set up for the last VP, but with experienced players this isn't as acute a problem.Initial Rating: 8.5 (060731)

Success often largely depends on who builds temples near enough to your territory, and starting position can be critical. Iron production is crucial - something I didn't understand heading into my first game or two. Compact two-hour play time makes this a worthy civilization-building-and-battling game, but it's not one I'll play often.

This game takes too long to get started, then ends too quickly. The rhondel mechanic is nice, and there is no luck involved in the game. I never found myself immersed in the game. This game is really on the cusp of being good. More theme or a backdrop story and different scenarios would help. There are some interesting choices to be made, but the game doesn't last long enough to really flesh out those choices. This is a game that could be tweaked and republished and become a classic. Right now it's just medicore.

It's a great addition to your collection if you want to give eurogamers a feel for conflict-driven games without scaring them off with dice-fests. I really like when games come with an almanach providing information on the theme of the game (in this case the Antike) Te endgame however feels very static. Most likely there's quite a few player just one step away from victory. And in that phase the game can become tedious.

This is one of my wife's favorites, probably because she wins at it regularly. Personally I feel like this game is too restricted. If you try and get creative in your growth strategy you will find there is little to no ability to recover. Also, your play style will be constrained by where you start and who you border. Bordering an aggressive player may result in the two of you ensuring the other has no chance at all of winning while others grow without interference. I prefer a game with more choices available.

I had pretty high hopes for Antike after reading about it, until I saw the Board Games with Scott video, which praised the game, but explained that fighting was relatively punishing so players tended to turtle (i.e., build up in their own corner and avoid conflict).  Games that allow fighting but discourage it are a pet peeve of mine, and I was worried that this would fit that mold.  Unfortunately it did, which made it not as good as I had originally hoped, but it also could be much worse.  I'm pretty ambivalent about the game now.  I like the Rondel mechanic since it makes turns quick and presents some difficult decisions, but combat is almost too simplistic for its own good.  The game also felt split into two parts, with the first being a race to pick up the easy victory points, and then everyone plateaued, at which point whoever could avoid fighting and wait around to pick up the spoils would have the best chance of winning.  I'd be willing to play again, but probably wouldn't be the one to suggest it (and don't feel the need to own it now).

The first Mac Gerdts game, I really liked it when it first came out.  I was a little distressed when it seemed like a war game, but the goal of victory points from other non-combat mechanics actually outweighs the effect of all-out attacks, which is what I prefer.  I would like to play more of this. (see - Navegador, Imperial, Hamburgum, The Princes of Machu Picchu).

Original and well thought out "Civ Light" game. Turns are unbelievably quick, making it easy to keep interest, and the action wheel mechanic makes it especially important to plan ahead. Also important to warrant regular play is that the game is very quick to explain, and newbies do not necessarily have a disadvantage over veterans. Finally, I love the way in which the board remains clear, and you have perfect information on which to plan your next move. One minor niggle: I do not particulary like the generic wooden components that have been used before in other games.

I like it! Of course the theme endears it to me, and I really like the "multiple paths to victory" that's present in most of Gerdt's Rondel series. I was a little annoyed that it suffered from the Wargame syndrome of "where you start on the map dictating your strategy," but other than that, I thought it had some promise.

UPDATE: The cracks started to show with multiple plays. Movement rules were always awkward to teach new players and our plays suffered from the "whoever destroys a temple in the end game is the winner" situations. I still very much liked the design (which is why I checked out both the 2P version and the eventual 2.0), but the original was too flawed for my taste.

Dissapointing. The rondel seemed to me quite disconnected from the whole civilization experience. I think it works better in normal resource optimation game. 

The non-luck compact maybe wasn't the best option here as it really isn't elegant and simple enough. 

I wasn't found on the scoring system as well.

Also, the game felt a bit scripted already on the first play.

Just played a four player game of this.  It seems to me that starting in a corner is an advantage.  The two players that only had two fronts to worry about were in the lead with the two players who had three fronts slightly behind.  Apparently there is a thread that discusses this very issue with some disagreement about who has the advantage.  I will have to read that, but perhaps the players with three fronts should have come to an agreement.

I think it works well that the game plays lightning fast during the early development while not much is going on and when it slows down, the level of interaction increases accordingly.  I like that most of the game focuses on development, but most games are going to end in a fight.  It is also a surprisingly simple game.  I used the Board Games with Scott video to explain the rules for me, and only a couple of additional clarifications were needed.

Its likely to be compared with Tempus when that comes out, and while this is a very good game, I think Tempus is a little more interesting and offers greater variety.

This was the first game I've played with the Rondel mechanic.  I felt it was novel but not particularly fun or meaningful in this implementation.  Still willing to try other Rondel game though to see if they are implemented better.

During the entire game, I was wishing I was playing other similar games instead.  NB: this game is NOT a civilization or empire building game.  For comparison, I felt Settlers of Catan was more of civilization or empire building game than Antike and I would hardly say Settlers is particularly a good example of either types of these games.  For the city building and gathering of different resource aspect of the game, Settlers of Catan scratches the itch much better than Antike.

Nor is Antike a combat game.  Antike is actually a VP points race game.  Very much in the way that Nexus Ops is not a straight area control/domination game and is all about VP.  As such a game, I felt Nexus Ops was much stronger and more enjoyable in this regard.  In fact the technologies in Antike are analogous to the abilities offered from the stronger more expensive units and the Energize cards in Nexus Ops.  Nexus Ops also has an excellent balancing mechanism where Antike is prone to run away leaders and king making. 

As a hybrid of Settlers and Nexus Ops, Antike does have its own niche but it wasn't one that I felt was implemented particularly well nor unique enough that it scratched an itch that either Settlers or Nexus Ops couldn't scratch on its own.

I find the gameplay boring and devoid of tension even in face of combat.

Quick game - for it's type - and very streamlined. Lots of different, almost equally viable strategies.

The only problem with the game is if you play with slow players. You will often have mapped out your actions three or four turns in advance, and if someone *always* has to think about what to do when it's his turn (as opposed to planning while waiting for his turn), you'll get pretty frustrated as your own turn is mostly done in 5 seconds - and then it's back to waiting for the next turn. But if all players are reasonably quick, it's great!

A minimalist's version of an empire building game.  Can be more militaristic than it might seem, especially with more players.  In order to get those last victory points, you're probably going to need to sack a temple or two.  The rondel keeps things moving quickly from player to player, although for slow players it can mean that they are caught completely unprepared when their turn comes around again.  The game is pleasantly quick for an empire building game, faster than any other game of that type I am familiar with while still being satisfying.

More enjoyable than Navegador for some reason. I like the concept of the Rondel and the idea that you have to do different things to get enough  of the cultural personalities to win... but the fact that you basically almost have to do all the different things in order to win lets it down somewhat.

We played Antikhe, where myself and EndofSupercycle No Spaces allowed Ian to win, almost unnoticed, as we battered a dominant Rome, played by Rod Chapman. Serves us all right, really. A game I would play again using better tactics! At leat I ended up with the most coins as the seafaring Carthage. No holiday trip to the Alps, alas.....I would certainly try an abridged version again, and this time, try to get representation in the capital city!

RATING: 5
This struck me as rather mediocre. The wheel for actions doesn't seem to work that well (I mean, since you can pay resources to go anywhere in an emergancy, whats the big deal?). The combat was simple but nothing special and the board can lockup with carfull players. I don't mind it, and I'd play it again, but it really didn't stand out above other bazillion mediocre almost-civiliation games like Mare Nostrum, Tempus, etc....

Rating would likely go up if I played this again because there was some external things that probably made my first play less enjoyable.

This game is OK, but I don't much like the endgame after a single play. Still, I would be willing to play it again to see whether the rating will improve from getting used to this game's rhythms. I'm not sure I need this in my collection, but I wouldn't mind playing it again with someone else's copy.

RATING: 5
It's ok, but it's just another euro. Nothing special that makes it jump out from any of it's thousands of brother games. Even the hyped "rondel" is just a graphically different way to represent, track, and limit turn options. Big deal. It's the euro/German thing to strip all theme or history out of a game just to make it playable quicker. I'd rather play History of the World or Britannia.

An excellent civilization building and military game. Early game is all about building your civilization and expanding, while late game is all about fighting. The rules are straightforward. The game is completely deterministic, and players will generally attack the leader.

Ok Eurogame. Rondel idea is nice and works well, but game weirdly discourages combat until the very end, where it abruptly turns into a bloodbath.

bought on the back of scott's review

enjoyable civilisation building game, playable in 2 hours (if you are lucky), although simplistic i feel there are enough descions to make this  re-playable, my first experience of "the rondel" system which i do like, nice componants (well meeples are always, arent they?) not to difficult for non-gamers to understandi wouild say as i just got in the dorrway type game as opposed to a specifically doorway one :)

Great game, and after a few more plays my rating may change. It's fast paced, and there is no random luck, just created luck. You make your own fortune in this game. I like it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Try though I may, I don't find a luck factor in this game.  A solid strategy game with multiple paths to attempt the win.  Though the theme is civilization, it's more a resource/build/expand game.  There is however no trading with other players in this game.  Is this truly Civ lite?  I'm not so sure, but it's as close as anyone else has come in trying to achieve that goal.  I particularly like the two sided board and the rondel mechanism for choosing actions.  It's certainly a contender for "most wood in a box" this year.

The wheel system action is really brillant, very good game.All is inside, War, diplomacy, Economical, Civilization developpment.Had it plastic minis I would have rated 10

RATING: 7
Not the perfect civ game by far - the civ elements are very basic,  it's more of an enhanced area control game.  That said,  the "micro-turn" idea is great - Rondel limits your choices,  and most of the time you can plan ahead.  Things slow down a bit when you need to buy troops,  and grind to a near halt whenever you need to move a bajillion troops.  It's made worse by the deterministic combat - you can see ahead of time where the combat can take place and how much it will cost you.

RATING: 7
A good empire building/world conquest game, but there is something missing for me.  With 4, there isn't very much conflict until the bitter end, when the only choice is to conquer temples.  Until then, the interaction is limited to beating others to the cards you want.

RATING: 6.5
A Civilization wanna-be. All players need to have at least a game under there belt. New players tend to see it as a war game and ignore getting the VP points needed to win. Also, my last game ended in a stalemate after 3.5 hours. Not what you want in a 5 player game (2 were eliminated).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.4
incredibly elegant game of development and conquest. Not too difficult to learn, the rules are not so difficult for such a game.
The game itself is extremely fast and time flyes away smoothly, there's almost no downtime.
Another very good thing is that you have really multiple possible strategy to follow to reach victory.
Even after a defeat, the sensation is that of a great experience

Not quite the theme-dripping Mediterranean Civ game I was expecting.  However, I like it more every time I play it.  Rondel mechanism combined with a limited number of actions per turn keeps the game moving nicely.

RATING: 7
purchased 19.12.06 A game certainly less dense than it's sister game, Imperial. I rather like the lightning qick turns that are closer to Hamburgum. If I had to rate the Rondel games, the original would be a very close second to Imperial, with Hamburgum bringing up the rare. I love the stocks & shares aspects to Imperial, but I love the buildup of civilisations in Antike..trying to keep up with your neighbouring civs in the personage department, which ultimately leads to bloodshead..fun stuff
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The different means of scoring seem balanced, but I haven't had the urge to play again to verify whether this is really the case.  I'm not sure that the combined military/resource system meshes well for me.

[i]Update[/i]:

Rating lowered. The early focus on resources tries my patience, and the endgame is unsatisfactory.  Players eventually hit a VP wall, then resort to temple-bashing or some other arbitrary "strategy" to sneak in a win.

I'd always rather play Imperial over this.

For a civilisation development game, Antike zips along at a cracking pace. The rondel works a treat. Each turn you do a little bit more, progressing your plans. Good fun. Slightly disappointing that the endgame always involves a big attack to capture that last needed VP, but the journey along the way is excellent.

Played a 4 and two 5 player games recently, all with newbie players. Easy to explain rules (although I muffed the city building rules... :( ). Great tension when each "Civ" starts to expand. Great player interaction as folks try to cook-up deals. It's fun when as soon as you've finished playing one game when one or two of the new players say "Let's play again, NOW! and everyone says "YES!!!".....the mark of a grand game IMHO! I played a very enjoyable 4-player SOLO game recently. In that solo game I started one Civ on the Growth strategy, one Civ on the Military strategy, and one on the Progress strategy all mentioned in the FAQ part of the rulebook. The 4th civ I tried a combination growth-military strategy. Great fun!

Environ 3 parties jouées
Le problème du jeu est que chacun joue défensif (sous peine de perdre) avant de tout lâcher en fin de partie. Dommage qu'on ne puisse pas jouer offensivement.
Pour le reste, excellent systeme et tres fluide.
J'espere que la version Duellum corrige ce point

Not sure what the big deal is with the rondel, I wasn't impressed in Hamburgum, nor was I here.  Everything just seem very scripted.  Round and round you gather up the resources, then you either research for technology, expand your territories, or construct temples so you can get more marble, gold or iron.  At least the beginning rounds moved fast enough not to be too bothersome, but once all the easy VP sources have been exhausted, the game slows down to a crawl as it moves into the conflict phase, because by then you can only gain additional points from attacking your neighbors and sacking their temples.  This is where everything becomes a drag, as the downtime multiplies, especially when you are in a 6-player game like I was, I totally wanted to just concede and call it quits.

Horrible endgame with an overrated system, while I did like the different methods of achieving VP, I just think the rest of the gameplay was poorly implemented.  My first experience with Antike was thoroughly underwhelming.

RATING: 5
It's ok. It's light and fast. The various starting empires don't really have any historical flavour whatsoever other than starting location, nor does the distribution of resources on the game board, which is a drawback and makes it feel a bit dry. The one-for-one annihalation combat can makes a deterministic game even more so, but at least it's fair. Just be very careful with temple placement, practically nothing is safe in the endgame unless its tucked away far from everything.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun. It's a bit quicker playing than Imperial. The game feels a bit abstract for the theme, but it's not bad. 

With more plays, I'm lowering my rating. The end-game is this game is really inadequate and it doesn't fit into either the economic or war molds very well.

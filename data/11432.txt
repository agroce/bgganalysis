A lot of preparation to play, but you learn a lot. Very hardware-heavy, geeks rejoice! A certain amount of role-playing as players are encouraged to think as a naval commander. I find the play moves moderately quickly for small engagements but could see it being cumbersome for larger battles. Overall, excellent!

RATING: 10
Hard to imagine a more complete modern naval warfare game.  This is as good as it gets ... without having to go through Surface Warfare Officer School.  Scenarios can range from the truly simple to the amazingly complex.  The choice is up to the players.  It's best with a referee and is easily played via email.  This is a challenging game that will take some time to master, but the payoff is there for those who make the effort.

The game is also well supported with articles and scenarios in THE NAVAL SITREP and HARPOON NAVAL REVIEW.  There have also been some supplemental materials published, such as SOUTH ATLANTIC WAR covering the Falklands Islands War and HIGH TIDE, adding many scenarios and new data for the Cold War.

Harpoon is an incredibly detailed simulation of modern naval warfare, and the rules can appear daunting, but reward the effort as the concepts are relatively straight forward and the complexity comes in the seemingly bewilderingly different weapons and sensor systems. That said, the game comes down to a planning phase, where you plot the movement and actions of your forces for the forseeable future, preferably on graph paper, followed by a stepping through of said orders, checking for detections by cross referencing with your opponenets plots.  Once detections start happening the game moves from decision point to decision point until something lethal starts flying.  If you can find your enemy first, you can win.  The best way to play this, then, is with a referee and graph paper, the referee doing all the detections and feeding back sensor information and the players making decisions based on this - this leads to some nail biting moments of frustration follwed by periods of sheer terror.  Not for the faint hearted and it helps to know something about real world navies.

Much improved over H3, with a more realistic radar/sonar system. Adds in complexity, but not too much.

Waiting for H5!

For those who want a highly realistic modern naval warfare game, this is it. Those looking for a quick game may want to look elsewhere, though. Try Shipwreck for a bit more abstract rendering of modern naval warfare.

Stick to the computer game - played on the tabletop it has little movement and it is all together too much work to track all the data.  Once the missiles are in the air it's all over save the dice rolling. Some of the umpired games can be amusing, but sooner or later, you'll encounter the combat system and that will (pun intended) sink things.

This is not a game, less of a simulation, but a technical manaual on Naval warfare.  I once played a scenario consisting of missiles attacking a ship near the Falkland Islands.  Just the missiles.  Having an enemy ship or an airplane would have made the whole thing too complex.  This system is best played using graph paper for the board.  All that being said, I have never regreted purchasing this system.

Heard it is good.  And I enjoyed the PC Harpoon very much, if not a bit on the boring side of the scale.  Someday...only someday, I would crack this game data annex!

The Admiralty Trilogy game of contemporary naval combat. As [i]Command at Sea[/i], very good, especially with double-blind play.

Excellent game; A worthy successor to Harpoon 3. Smooth and intuitive mechanisms, espc. the handling of different generations of equipment vs eath other. 

I still miss some rules for datalinking, and information handoff from sensors to weapons/directors, and some quantification of CIC/Raid capacity.

I get to play this game way to rarely

In some ways, an improvement over GDW's rendition of the Harpoon game. This one takes into consideration generational differences in weapon (and countermeasure) capabilities. It also removes the % chance used for detection via radar or sonar. Not sure I like that step, as I liked they way it was before.

However, the rules also take into account stealth technologies and other new developments.

Probably the most detailed simulation of modern naval warfare. IMHO too detailed  to play it on the table, but it's GREAT fun via Email, using graph paper to plot movement.

Very enjoyable naval warfare simulation. After playing a few times solo, I found the system works very well and is fun to play. It's also less complicated than it first seems, owing to the over-written rulebook (one of my two quibbles--the other being that filling out the record sheets can often take far longer than actually playing a scenario). The rulebook has a lot of detail, but most of it provides flavor for the experience, rather than actual rules.

As Harpoon and South Atlantic War. Obsessed with technical details but completely neglects the human factor. A fantasy product from the likes of the RAND Corporation. Engrossing, but not sure how accurate it is.

THE definative modern naval wargame.  Data annexes alone are worth the price.  Playable yet realistic simulation.

Played the original version with a referee who knew the rules and it worked well though it is very cerebral. Now own latest version which is even more complicated. Doubt I will ever play it despite owning fleets of model ships.

SOLD both rules and ships (2017)

Highly detailed modern naval warfare, but you need to play double blind to get full effect.  Can be a bit robotic/deterministic when it comes to percentages for detection/attack etc.

Actually I have never played a full game, I have just scratched the surface. Hard to play without an umpire and dedicated players. But I like to tinker with my own home grown rules, and Admiralty Trilogy products are an unsurpassable source of information and ispiration. If you are seriously interested, don't miss the Naval SITREPs, full of scenarios, updates and additional rules.

Think 'spreadsheets' when you think of this game.  Not that there are many, but the initial knee-jerk reaction is the gaming experience this game offers.  It's a LOT of detail - in fact, the die rolls used for pretty much all combat resolution are 2 d10 paired in such a way to calculate percentages, as the game uses percentage calculations for pretty much everything (chance of detection, odds of a weapons hit, etc).  That's the only thing that really detracts from how fun this game is - and it is fun! - it's just SO complicated, and there is SO much to keep track of.  Also, given that detection is 90% of modern naval warfare, and this game has no way of abstracting it (you simply roll for odds based on range and sensors available), you really, really need a third player as a referee.

RATING: 7
Very complex rules. Confusing for the beginner but very addictive for some reason. I'm glad I spent the time to learn how to play. 

I found that playing against a computer program helped me learn the rules at first. (You can't make rule mistakes in a computer game!)

The man who invented this was undoubtedly a genius.

As others have said, the rules are as confusing as Fizzbin. But once you understand it, it all makes sense somehow.

Don't ask me why, but my husband absolutely loves Cribbage.  Now, I'm all for race games, but usually when they involve throwing dice (or, as in Senet, carved sticks).  With Cribbage you pull cards... and it just doesn't do it for me.  I'd rather play Parcheesi.  Or the Royal Game of Ur, or Senet... or just about anything else.  Which is a shame, since my husband loves it so much.

ABSTRACT, FAMILY

Play this card game with any standard deck of cards. The rules available at pagat.com and Wikipedia are clear enough to help one learn the game.

I have faint memories of my grandfather and uncle playing this.

My cribbage board was a thrift store purchase: there is nothing special about it.

Recommended with 2-4 players (best 2). 30 mins.

Great for those times when a basic card game is called for. Great basic card game with lots of strategy. I especially like the 3 player game. Each player is dealt 5 cards and throws one in the crib. Much closer and tense game than 2 player.

RATING: 10
Plays best with two, IMO. This will keep you thinking about the best hand to keep for the play, what to keep for the show, and what to crib.  There are lots of decisions to be made, and you have to work with the hand you're dealt.  Since multiple hands are played, the number of good and bad hands usually balances out over the course of a game.

RATING: 4
It's not completely boring because you have to figure out how to play your hand.  But there's not a whole lot of critical decision making going on because there aren't lots of good different ways to play your hand.So assuming you can play your hand competently, the game is largely the luck of the draw.  You can only do as well as your hand.  So ultimately, it's just small calculations to kill time.

tried learning this one on yahoo prior to playing it face to face.  their rules aren't the greatest.  checked it out at pagat then started playing at yahoo, still a little fuzzy on some of it.  a face to face play with a copy of the rules nearby finished it off.  surprised it took that long for a classic card game, one that i thought would be simple and ultimately was.  much easier to teach than to learn from scratch.  it's tough to tell just how great the luck influence is, but it's very satisfying to have aha moments on strategy and even if you're just flipping cards the gameplay is very pleasant.  coule become my favorite 2p standard deck card game if it has some legs, but i've got a lot more to try.

RATING: 10
My absolute favorite game.  I learned this from my father after watching him and my grandfather play it again and again when they visited.  It's a game of quite a bit of luck.  You can't help how the cards fall, it's what you do with them that counts.  I would play this over any other game if I could just find opponents.  Oh well.

NOTE: Rating refers to the two player version only.  I don't like three or four player cribbage AT ALL.  Those would get a 3 instead of a 10.

I finally got a board and it's just like the board I had when I was a kid ... down to the unevenly-drilled holes.

I probably played this game 1,000 times in high school.

UPDATE: that board broke and I replaced it with a nice solid Bicycle board which has holes that were drilled straight, but a dodgy pin storage area that I had to bend the metal key to get to hold pins in at all.

Perhaps the best card game ever!  What makes it special is that while luck *is* a large factor in the game, playing the odds and your board position can make you a consistent winner.  This game is played at two levels:  those who just 'hold for max hand' and those who play the odds - and their opponent!

A solid card and race  game combination.  Unique card play makes the strategy interesting and unlike most card games.  The race is really just a scoring track, but it has the feel of a race.  Despite being a card game, the winner is often the most skilled player.  [GTI Code: APSD]

My wife's favourite game.  I do enjoy the game as well, it is a nice diversion and can be played anywhere on our small travel Cribbage board.

It is a random game, but it requires you to do the best with your cards, which means the better player normally wins.  There are three ways to score points, by revealing your cards during pegging, with your hand and with the crib, which switches sides each hand.

A fun game that I am almost always ready to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Calculating strategy card game, one of the best around for two players. Cribbage board makes "pegging" (scoring) fun and adds tension as you race to the finish. Also playable with 3 and 4 hands in partnership, although not as competitive. Requires minimal space to play, so it is highly portable.

RATING: 6
A true college standby.  Played innumerable games when I shouldv'e been studying instead.  When we were in a rush, we'd play with ten card hands, and be done in three turns or so.  I also have a soft spot in my heart for cribbage, as my fifth grade teacher taught it to us oh so many years ago, and that's what we played in class every Friday for math.  Obviously a game where you try to make the most of what's dealt to you, I have come to dislike the randomness the deck provides.  If the cards are against you, it doesn't matter how you play your hand...you're done.  Still will play to pass the time, but prefer games with more decisions, strategy, and theme.  [Gift & thrift]

A casual card game with a bit of strategy and a healthy dose of luck. It's quick and doesn't require too much thought, so it's a good game to play while talking. Cribbage is a fine game that I enjoy playing, but isn't complex enough to make me want to play it as much as games that offer more interesting decisions and strategy (Tichu, Haggis, Spades). Nevertheless, this is a classic game that is good for some casual entertainment. (2011-02)

I just see virtually no areas for interesting decisions. I played for the first time recently, after reading the rules, and thought I had played incorrectly because I was expecting more. Nope, I was playing correctly.

I used to play multiple daily tournaments of this on whatever the MSN gaming network was called decades ago and the game has been a part of every family gathering since I've been able to hold a hand of cards.  It's one of the few great 2 player games one can play with a deck of cards, but the room for skill seems to be so low that after the first 10,000 hands one can play automatically and still win 50% of the time.

RATING: 10
My absolute favorite two-player card game. Players score points based on the combination of cards played and held in the hand. Dealer also scores for a hand in the "crib." But the 'Pone scores first! Creates some tense end-game situations. And you can hold a conversation and not lose track of the game. Can be played with 3 or 4 as well.

RATING: 7
// This game has grown on me the most of pretty much any
game that I started off hating. I felt it was too random,
but found there's enough control over the randomness. I 
felt it was too difficult to know what to hold and what to
crib, but found it's pretty intuitive, just takes some
playing to understand. This is not a bad 30 minute game.

Standard things you'll hear : "You suck at dealing!", "I don't want to give you any of these!", "These couldn't have been shuffled enough, I have the same hand as last time!"

Wife and I play very often.  Always when we travel anywhere.
Decided to get a custom board made as the crown jewel of my collection - found a VERY talented artist in Portland that made me a board that will hopefully last a few lifetimes! :)

I like cribbage but would rather play online.  There are too many rules to keep track of about cheating and protocol that really have nothing to with the card game itself.  So I prefer a program to do the scoring and keep the nuisance stuff out.

RATING: 6
15-2, 15-4, hey, look what's over there!... 15-10, 15-12, and a run makes 15 points.  I like the partner aspect and the common crib decisions.  Clearly card draws will make or break your game when all players are of equal skill, but enough depth to let vets shine against newer players.  I know that Grandma Bernice taught me this as a kid and I loved playing it with her, but I had to be re-taught when I played it recently.

It's the type of game that me and my dad pull out on Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc. and sit, have a few beers and play the best two out of three. There is so much strategy in this game, much more than you even realize at times.

Cribbage is ok, but honestly, I don't see why so many think it's the best 2 player card game out there.  The best fast, light 2 player card game?  Maybe.  But where are the decisions?  You only have so much control, and half the game seems to be guessing what the opponent has and how they'll sequence.  It's fun, but Haggis or Battle Line has this beat, regardless of Cribbage's staying power.

I think rather than struggling through the rules, I will ask one of my friends that knows the game to teach it to me again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fellow BGGer (I forget who) wrote that Cribbage is "way more fun than it has any right to be."  This is exactly correct.  There is obviously room for skill in the throw.  By contrast, at first the actual play of the cards seems to leave little room for many interesting decisions, but after ten games or so you start to appreciate some subtle tactics that are possible.  The play has grown much more interesting as I have gained experience.  Still, there is a lot of luck, but this is made up for by the frequency of suspenseful endings and come-from-behind wins.  It is a game with a high "fun quotient."  It is best for two players by far, but the three and four player variants are still fun enough to be worth playing.

UPDATE:  OK, I think I officially have an iPhone Cribbage addiction.  Raising my ranking to a 9.  More and more scope for skill is becoming apparent to me. Of iPhone apps, Trivial Technology has the slicker graphics and user interface, but Cribbage Pro has the more serious players (and I like that with Cribbage Pro you can do "best of X" matches).

Best two player card game there is and a real contender for best two player game. Surprisingly modern for a game nigh on 400 years old; with a theme it could be a best seller - though there are probably more cribbage boards sold each year than all but the best selling designer games.

It could be because of family traditions but this is my favorite game to take camping. Takes very little space and does not require a board if you have paper (however moving the peg 20 spaces does provide a certain level of satisfaction). You can play with nearly no light and nearly no energy, but is still fun when you are wide awake too.
A single game takes a reasonable amount of time but by keeping track of games and skunking you can have a "tournament" that lasts the entire trip.

Just learning this game on my iTouch (thank goodness for automatic scoring and the "explain" button - I couldn't make heads or tails of the rules when I read through them prior to this electronic version).  Pretty good game to while the time away -- still hard for me to remember the scoring, but I like the fact that there are so many possible combos and that you have to keep your head up to remember to use the crib and the starting card to your advantage (or try to make it for your opponent's disadvantage).

Cribbage is a 10 for two reasons.
The first being that I will really play it anytime someone offers.
The second is because of the memories. Learning it from my Grandma when I was in middle school, playing with my parents on Sunday afternoons, and teaching my wife on our honeymoon.

Downloaded a Cribbage app for my phone to help me learn in, and now I spend any free minute I have playing this dumb, yet addicting game.  I can see how sailors would play it, its a great way to pass the time, and some of the scrimshaw pieces are beautiful, another reason why Dad liked it so much.

Card game with unusual scoring.

RATING: 5
The core gameplay is compelling, with a lot of tough decision making and tactical play. But it has a couple downsides that really hurt the score for me. First, the scoring board makes it much less portable than other card games. Second, the strategy and tactics are quite opaque to new players, and so it's not very much fun until you have invested time into learning it.

I own many copies and variants of Cribbage:
1. Garage sale game, ~$1, summer 2014.  Black pegless cribbage board, 2 tracks, apparently for use in tournament play.  2 legs of 60 each.  Uses sliders and dials instead of pegs.
2. The Perfect Cribbage Board - a plastic board shaped as "29", 3 tracks.  Mismatched pegs remain.  I don't remember where I got this one from, but it's likely Grandma and Grandpa Ferster's from Canwood.  They didn't use this one, they always used a standard wooden board with 3 tracks.
3. Travel cribbage, ~$.50.  Plastic foldup board, 2 tracks, unopened.
4. Acme wooden cribbage board, garage sale for $1, 2 tracks.  It's in great condition.  It was originally purchased from Zellers.
5. My own cribbage board, which I have had since about 1974.  3 coloured tracks.  This is my favourite board to use.
6. Strategy Crib.  An S-shaped track on a 3-player coloured wooden board.  It has bonus peg holes of +5 and +9, and penalty peg holes of -5 and -9.  I remember this being a good variant.
7. Cribbage for Travel.  Paid $3.95.  50 paper scorepads where you mark off your scores as you progress.  I believe I found this our summer vacation driving to the Maritimes - the packaging says it's a "Souvenir of Atlantic Canada".  (I don't know how popular cribbage is in the Maritimes.)
8. Cross Crib.  See my separate entry on that game.  Scrabble-style variant for up to 4 players.
9. Chicago Cribbage.  See my separate entry on that game.  Additional rules for the standard game of cribbage.
10. Cribbage the Board Game.  See my separate entry on that game.
11. Roughrider Cribbage.  See my separate entry on that game.  Similar to Cribbage the Board Game.
12. CribbGolf.  I own 2 copies.  This is my favourite cribbage variant.  See my separate entry on that game.  I have played it over 100 times - I number my scoresheets.
13 CribbGolf Pebble Beach.  Almost the same as CribbGolf but with a different layout.
14. Tiny 2-track wooden board with metal pegs.
15. Wooden 2-track 29 board with metal pegs.
16. Wooden golf-themed board that Sandy passed down to me.  Golf irons are the pegs.  The score runs backwards from 115 down to 5.  The board is shaped like a golf bag, with a handle and the clubs sticking out of the top.  "Made in Canada by Cribbage Works".  Limited edition, with a unique serial number.
17. Myrtlewood cribbage board from The Wooden Nickel in Port Orford, Oregon.  $35 US.
18. 4-Track Corners cribbage board.  Bought from Warp-1 Comics and Game in Edmonton for $29.99 in 2018.

I have scored a 29 hand once in my life, playing with Grandpa Ferster in about 1979 or 1980 in Canwood.  I cut the ace of spades to get my hand.  Grandpa had played Cribbage his entire life and had never seen a 29 hand before either.  I believe I have witnessed my sister and Darryl Thiessen each get hands of 28.

John Hynd is the best Cribbage player I have ever played.  I was no match for him.  I have a few Cribbage books, but the advice given in them seems so disjointed that I can't say that I have improved my game much from reading them.

I would like to try playing Crib Wars sometime.  It's an extended version of cribbage on a specialized board.  It likely costs $30 though.  I think I would need another diehard cribbage fan to enjoy playing it with though.

I love playing Cribbage!

I played cribbage with my grandfather in the warm kitchen of my grandparent's trailer home when I was a youngster. Grandpa Brown was a retired farmer. He stood six-foot-two and had big, sun-brown hands. He'd lost, variously, some or most of four or five fingers to the combine over the years, but he never lost his love of cards. Cribbage was the one game he and I played together, just the two of us. I played the old classic kiddie games with Grandma--Trouble and Sorry! and Candyland--but cribbage was an adult game and it was ours. We played first it on his worn, rectangular board and later on the spiffy new 29 shaped board we'd gotten him for Christmas one year. The best cribbage hand I've ever been dealt, a 28 pointer, was in one of our games. Grandpa Brown's been gone for better than fifteen years now, but I can still see him riffling the cards in his peculiar, stump-fingered way, hear him counting, "Fifteen-two, fifteen-four, that's all there is, and there ain't no more."

While I enjoy this traditional card game, when playing with seasoned players I've had my hand predicted correctly many times after my first card down. After this happened every game for a span of 8 hours one day...I noticed it's big gripe for me. Once you see your hand, you don't really have that many options, the game falls about 90% on the card draw.

I'll still happily play, and am curious to see if I'm wrong. But that's been my experience.

There's a weird stigma attached to cribbage because of its age (like Rummikub).  People generally never want to play it, even myself.  Growing up, it was always a game I played on other peoples' boards and though I always enjoyed it, I never really walked away thinking, "Oh, I've got to get me one of those."

However, I found myself missing the game and invested in a beautiful solid board from We games.  It's not the fanciest board, but it most certainly isn't the worst, either, and though you technically don't need a board to play the game, I think that having one that you like really enhances the game and increases your desire to play it.

Cribbage is a game that's older than rocks and has largely remained unchanged since its invention by Jesus (note: game was not invented by Jesus) and it's a testament to its design that it has lasted into the present day with an incredibly large player base.  As a traditional card game that doesn't require the peg board, you can play this for as little as $1.  That's it.  The rules for counting cards aren't as simple as they could be, but play enough hands and it starts to become second nature.  When you start playing it, it might take you a good 30-seconds to a minute to count your cards, but over time, you'll be doing it in under 10 seconds.

So why's it great?  First of all, it's one of the most solid 2-player games you can play, ever.  While there is a large element of chance in the card draw and the cutting of the deck, there is still a deep strategic element to it when you're trying to set up the crib or figure out how best to use your position as pone to score out first.  So what if you give your opponent a pair of jacks if you're going to reach 121 before they even get to start counting?  Working out the probability of certain hands coming up might be attractive to some players, but really the idea is to simply figure out how to keep your scores high and your opponent's score low.  Working out card combos ahead of time for the final scoring is engaging and fun, but knowing that you can also score out during play with some clever guesswork and prediction also keeps everyone on their toes.

The only real downside is learning how to count your cards correctly and muggins rules (stealing uncounted points) don't really encourage people to keep playing - instead, if you are the more experienced player, be kind and point out the combos, make sure your opponent is seeing exactly what you're doing and you might just have a frequent opponent in the making.

Never play this 3 or 4p.  This game is really for 2p.

I really like this simple yet challenging classic.  Great 2-player game.  The constant shuffling can get a little repetitive, but the game is very fun and replayable.  The luck of the cards is mitigated by a multitude of real choices and card combinations that you can make in any given hand/round.  And of course, since many hands are played, you have the opportunity to overcome a bad hand.  The rules are best found and illustrated online in the wikipedia.org which has helpful illustrations.  The rules that come with the game are difficult to understand.  Easily found at Target and very affordable.  Should be a part of everyone's collection!

Essential two player game. It's my golden standard of luck vs strategy. I have definately lost games sheerly on being outplayed by my opponent. Cribbage is one of those games that actually gets better with an opponent(s) you've played countless games against. 

28 hands: 1 
Double Skunks: 1 (01/30/09 online) 
Oldest opponent: 98 years old

At over 1000 games of Cribbage my views of the game have changed slightly. At first I felt that there was a fair amount of nuance, but now I feel it's more clear-cut decisions of general strategy followed by luck. Now, you could argue against me and perhaps have a valid point, but this is my personal view of the game. It's still an above average game, and I'm happy to play a game now and again.

Classic card game where card combinations win points.  

Requires decision making for selecting cards for the crib, and which order to play the cards in hand.  Kids enjoy finding the point scoring combinations, and the imbalance of each game turn makes it interesting.  It's relaxing, and yet has enough going on (e.g. probability, card combination) to make it very enjoyable.  

See some more of my thoughts about Cribbage in response to an [thread=1940898]excellent review[/thread] here: https://boardgamegeek.com/article/28294300#28294300

Typical two player game lasts 8-9 hands.

I remember learning to play this game on a hot day in Mexico in a trailer with the smell of coffee in the air, drinking a Coke.  I was 8.  The next time I played, I was in NYC drinking beer with my sister while she chain-smoked -- I was 26.  I still liked it.

Cribbage is just so wacky, you have to love it.  The count and the combination points mix things up nicely, but skill decides the majority of games.  Hands are fast, and the game really doesn't suffer any whether you're playing it 2-player, 4-player with partners, or even 3-player (dealing 1 directly to the crib).

Took this on our honeymoon and taught my wife to play, she is now addicted to it (she now has an app of it on her iPhone). Some luck but mostly skill, the three phases of play mean you need to balance your hand and also scupper your opponents crib (or box).

The perfect 2 player travel game, you don't need the board, just a deck of cards and someway to count the score to 121.

I am a memeber of the ACC (American Cribbage Congress) and am always willing to teach or play anyone who wants to learn.

Excellent game.  I'm glad my maternal grandfather taught me how to play when I was 15 years old (27 years ago).  I still enjoy playing it.  Btw, try playing it with 12 cards/player/hand.  This means that your playing/counting hand will be 8 (instead of 4) and that each crib will be 8 (instead of 4).  The scoring for the play, the score, and the crib gets insane.  I don't plan to ever go back to the original way of playing Cribbage.  The new way is so much better!  Played again.  Still prefer 12-card version.  Played another 12-card version ("double Cribbage") of this with today (1-8-2012) with Mr. Billington and lost.

Cribbage is a beautiful card game. The simplicity is wonderful, but a surprising depth is derived from that fact. I spent a whole day by the pool playing match after match with friends in 2016 and loved every moment of it. At that point it probably would have ranked in the super-filler top-10, but a few games have come along that have pushed it down. I do love it to pieces though.

[2015.01.10]

This game has started to really grow on me.  It seemed like busy work at first, but I'm starting to see that really it's a tempo-game that is nice for filling some time and spending time with loved-ones.

Cribbage has almost all of the best mechanics of traditional card games. Bluffing, straights,flushes and counting - its a beautiful cross breed between 21 and poker.

This splendid olde Englishe card game - an enhancement of the even older "Noddy", does not require a huge amount of skill, but rattles along at a fair old pace and is a great filler for the odd half hour or so.  Cribbage solitaire is also one of the most enjoyable single-handed "patience" games, and the indispensible Cribbage board lends itself easily to scoring for a myriad other games.  No household should be without one.

Cribbage has a lot of luck, but there are so many opportunities to score points that it becomes very tactical. Choosing cards that work best for both the play and counting points in your hand is important, as is the order you play your cards during the play. You can even bluff by playing certain cards that your opponent thinks are part of common runs, pairs, or used to equal 15, to possibly keep them from playing certain cards. So while there is luck, a seasoned player will most likely beat a weaker player because of these tactics. The rules are simple to teach, games can be tense, gameplay is deep, cribbage is super portable, and when you win you feel it's usually because you played better than your opponent.

Lots of plays of Cribbage. I constantly waver between two extremes: comparing it to Backgammon's (a game I LOVE) complex tactical play that will win you lots of games in the long run, hating it because the luck of the draw can have such a significant impact on the score.

My opinion usually rises and falls with the frequency with which the cut card gives a player 8-10+ points. I am annoyed every time this happens. Yes, even when it is me (it makes me feel dirty).

The only standard card deck game I play.......and the only one that's really a board game! Taught to me by my dad when I was a kid and a great family favourite that I still play with him every now and again, so worth extra bonus points for father-son bonding. Played so many times over the years I can count hands in my sleep. It's all about playing the odds with some bluff in the go round and the track race really adds a feeling of tension.....there's nothing like pipping your opponent just short of the line with a 24 point hand.

With my regular partner, the game comes down to lucky/unlucky hands far too often for my liking. Keep cards that combine well, discard cards that combine badly, and when the choice is tough, rely utterly on the luck of the draw ("If I give him this card, and he doesn't have Card X, he'll be stumped. But if he does have Card X...").

There are masses of different ways to play a hand, but very few of those approach optimum play, so with two reasonably experienced players I can't imagine the game being decided by skill any more than it's decided by which player lucks out on a mega-scoring hand during play. In the long run, the better player wins through, but it doesn't hold my interest enough for there to be a long run!

How had I never played this game?  Seems that everyone's Grandparents but mine taught them this game at a very young age.  I'm glad to have learned it and even thrifted a nice board for future plays.  It also has one of the best game terms I've ever seen: "Skunking" your opponent sounds as embarrassing as it should be!

In my opinion the purest, most enjoyable two-player card game ever invented.  (And what will most likely be the only 10 rating I ever grant to a game!) I&#039;ve been playing it for half my life and counting.  Scales well with novices and more experienced players.  Mechanics are fast and easy (once you get used to the scoring mechanics).  The board isn&#039;t technically necessary (it&#039;s only used to keep score to 121), but it adds to the charm.  The game has an excellent mix of skill and of luck.  Can play with more than two, but should really be experienced as a two-player.  When you know the game by rote and play with another experienced player, the games are fast and soothing in their speed and mechanics.  I recently discovered this online (Pogo.com) and have enjoyed it there as well.

Known to my girlfriend's family as "that one sailors' game". The game is a convoluted set of rules. However, once you are acquainted with all of them, it is easy to sink hours into the game with one, two or three other players chasing the elusive 29 hand, shouting "19!" or "knobs" along the way.

Pegging with a cribbage board is preferable but a pen and paper will do just fine for scoring purposes. Having said that, the game really only requires you to have a deck of cards and is, therefore, always accessible.

It has it's limits of fun though, and can get boring after a few rounds, in which we usually switch to Yahtzee or some other light game.

I learned this game from my father and my grandpa before I was 5.  Obviously, I still like it a lot; less obviously, I still play a little like I did back then!

One variant I learned early was to NOT reshuffle between hands, but play through the deck completely.  This tends to lower hand scores, but also rewards card memory.

Have tried a solitaire variant as well, with 2 and 6, and up card going to the bottom of the deck after hand + crib scored, last hand is only 4 cards.

This, and Spades are my top traditional card games.  Cribbage has a good amount of probability theory involved in the play, and the unusual track scoring that sets it apart from many card games.  There is also significant bluff and interractive play amongst partners.  

Downside, there are some variations in play as well as the "stealing" rule of taking points your opponent didn't see.  This frustrates some players.  (As a family gamer, I usually give points back to the original player.)  Also, it does require a board, which is easy enough to get.

I need someone experienced to teach this to me.  I tried learning it out of a book and, I dunno, it sucked.  Of course, I'll concede that perhaps I was an awful teacher and even less of an apt pupil...

Hopefully someone enthusiastic can reveal the magic to me.

UPDATE:  I tried learning this from an octogenarian Navy vet; experience was akin to indoctrination into a secret society—

"You have to fizzjibbit the woodle, but only if a poon-waffler is orgiastic.  And for the love of God don't faffle the nard-waggler!  Because then I'll have to muggins the peggle and that would double-whoopty your farn noodle."

—scads of jargon, stuff happening for no apparent reason, and pretty much the opposite of enlightenment at the end.  Frustrating and opaque.  There's obviously something going on at the center of it, but I have no idea what that might be.  (See also:  Umberto Eco's [i]Foucault's Pendulum[/i])

UP-UPDATE:  I tried learning this from online videos; can't seem to find one that is clear, concise, well-presented, doesn't involve homebrew variants and is aware of their intended audience, e.g., [i]someone who has never played before[/i].

At this point I'm finding very little correlation between the book, the person and the videos—indicating that this is one of those oral tradition games where the rules are whatever your grandma taught you when you were small.

NOTE TO SELF:  Get a time machine—and a different grandma.

My grandfather taught me to play this when I was little and I've revisited it a few times since. It's a game of opportunistic scoring, but with only 12 out of 52 cards in play at once the likelihood of your opponent having a particular card are quite low. I know a lot of people swear by Cribbage, but I just don't get it. I suspect the weird game rituals and scoring are the selling point here, but for me Gin Rummy is a much better traditional game for two.

I was first introduced to this game when I was a little kid. When I spent the night at my aunt and uncle's, I would wake up and find them a the kitchen table playing cribbage and drinking coffee. Today, I do that with my wife. 

It's just a simple game that uses a standard 52 deck of cards. You score points by playing pairs, three and four of-a-kinds, and additions of 15. First person to 120 points wins.

What makes this game fun, is that there is a 'S' line at 90 point marker. That 'S' stands for "skunk." If you get to 120 points before your opponent reaches 90....you not only beat them...you skunked them!

I've played several times at least (mostly back in college). There is some strategy, making it a somewhat balanced strategy/luck game. I remember it being a bit more fun. We played a two player game on 12/24/07 and it took about an hour with rules explaination (10min). Goal is to get 121 points first. You can skunk your opponnet by winning before they reach 90 points. A double skunk happens if the don't reach 60. Each are dealt a hand of six cards and turn up a "starter card". Each choose 2 cards for the dealer to keep as a "crib". Next you play rounds of counting up th 31. A=1,K,Q,J=10. If you reach 15 or 31 exactly, you get 2 pts. If you end the game you get 1pt. Subsequent rounds happen until each player is out of cards. Next you evaluate each hand and the crip for points. You get points for cards combination of 15, pairs, runs of cards, etc. (in fact these count in the first round however they are less likely. I'd recommend giving this a game play since you can play with a standard deck of cards and it's worth a game play. As you get more comfortable with it, it will take less time as well.

Jan09: That's a darn good game.  An oldie but a goodie eh?  The whole game is basically in deciding what to discard, which caught me a little off guard.  I usually like my games a little more involved with card play.

Anyway, the rules are tough to pick up no matter what anyone else says.  I eventually got through them by reading plenty of example games.  There are some good cheat sheets on the official cribbage websites.

So how is it compared to "modern" games?  Not bad.  The randomness is a little high.  The decisions are light.  The game has that touch of "fun" though so it's worth breaking out at times.

This game has a lot of peaks and valleys. The decision of what to throw in the crib is agonizing, followed by the extreme hope that the cut card will be just what you need for a huge hand. While pegging, you have to be constantly aware of how you are helping your opponent get 15s, 31s, gos, runs and pairs, while also trying to get them yourself.

Great for 2 and 4 (teams). Can be played with 3, but not ideal.

I give cribbage a higher rating sentimentally. I logged well over 7,000 games in college, teaching several of my buddies on our dorm floor. We usually had a cribbage board going in 1-4 different rooms, with 2,3, or 4 players, and always a penny a point, nickel after the skunk line, and a dime per point after the double skunk. We talked, we played, we bonded.

DeLynn is the highest rated cribbage player in the US:

"At his own admittance, DeLynn believes that every beginner who doesn't make any substantial errors should win about four games out of ten against anyone.

A classic about getting the right cards and recognizing what points are aviable.  The real skill comes in discarding to the crib.  Realizing what to put down plays a big role in determining the eventual winner.  There are enough turns that luck generally evens out over the course of the game.

I learned to play it in college because my roomie was a gamer, as well. We alternated this game with backgammon, principally, and had quite a time doing so. At first, the majority of the joy was found in a muggins but, eventually, we learned the art of the crib. It's fun but it can get old unless you're playing with the right people or the right conditions.

My wife's family is very big on cribbage so I have been trying to learn and appreciate it. I certainly enjoy every game I play of it but I never ask/want to play it when we aren't with her family. It takes (for me) a great deal of practice to learn all the different scoring combos/sequences.

Not a bad game, just not my favorite.

RATING: 8
This is actually my daughters game. This game is really an interesting game to play. All these years I thought it was a racing board type game and you 'raced' to the end. Now that I read the rules and played, I was surprised to find out it is a Card Game. We had fun learning and playing it! I printed out a cheat sheet that showed the scoring for "PLAY" and on the flip side, it has the "SHOW" scores and that really helped out allot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One of the all-time great games that can be played with an ordinary deck of cards.

Two stages of play, sequential scoring (so that the other player may win even if you have more points to score), and a whole lot of strategy when placing cards into your (or your opponent's crib).  Recommend playing with the 'muggins' rule... even experienced players miscount once in a while.

I used to own a cribbage board, but I'm not sure where it's gone off to...  This is a decent game (my rating reflects how much I want to play it), but for some reason it never really grabbed me as a must play.  I know it might sound odd, but the scoring isn't really that intuitive, which is a shame considering the nifty peg boards out there.

RATING: 10
The "gold standard" two-player card game, popular since 1630 for a reason. After four hundred years still feels fresh and unlike anything else. It all works perfectly. Nice mix of different elements: crib donation; card play; playing to match peg position, dealer versus non-dealer strategies. There's always some choice to be made. After decades, turning up one's crib remains thrilling! Just enough luck to keep it jazzed.  A terrific balanced game where the sum is better than its constituent parts (which granted seem boring on paper). My wife calls Cribbage "a series of treats." (If you think cribbage is trivial, read article 6206763.)

Excellent two-player card game, offering frequent decisions between tough choices, and the chance for some nicely deceptive card play.  I've probably spent as much time in this game as in all others I've ever put on my Palm: http://www.freewarepalm.com/games/cribbage.shtml

RATING: 10
Card game requiring a board, you score points based on pairs, totals of fifteen, runs and (with 4 or more) same suit - with a rotating second hand to help keep the score even. 

HUGE PLUS: quick, challenging, even can be played without the board if you know what you're doing
MINUS: (none at all!)

ESSENTIAL for every household to have on a nice cold day by the fire, with a glass of wine and a good friend….

Cribbage is like Backgammon where I never knew how to play when I was younger but now that I do, it's not half bad. There are much better standard games that I'm willing to play but the occasional Cribbage game isn't out of the question.

I think I played cribbage a little as a kid, but I had forgotten everything and just had it re-taught to me. I have to say, this is probably the best regular deck card game for two I have ever played. Is this possibly the oldest scoring track? Fifteen is a surprisingly interesting number to get combinations for. The many ways to get points give you interesting options. The game never seems to get dull. Glad to get to know you, Crib!

I learned to play this by messing around with a computer (Commodore Amiga, actually) version when I was 16. Then I started playing it with real cards with real people and have lost count of how many times I played it in the late 80s and early 90s. (The playcount here is only recording plays since I added it to this list.)
Sometimes it feels like many games fall into the same pattern, since there are only a limited number of ways of making 15 and the other scoring hands, but that feeling of "this again?" only appears when I've played it dozens of times in one sitting. Otherwise it's a brilliant game that I will always be up for playing (assuming I haven't already just played it 20 times, of course).

I have played this game hundreds of times and while I believe that if the rules are strictly adhered to (mainly the rule that if a player misses a 15 in their hand the opponent gets the points) that skill matters I haven't been able to exceed a 60% win rate. Disregarding the luck/skill aspect, this game is a very enjoyable, slightly mathy card game that reminds me of spending time with old people in shaded back yards on hot summer days (with a gentle cool breeze and some lemonade).

Solid old-school cards & counting game. I like it as a decent way to kill time, but tend to view it as being really luck dependent. Sure there's some strategy in what cards to hold and what cards to play, but it's a pretty level playing field. Ultimately I don't see many opportunities to manage your luck or to play aggressively as in a game like backgammon, which is also at its core a game of chance.

My father in law taught me this game.  It took me a while to catch on, but I can see why this game is a classic.  It's portable, quick, and while it initially appears to be complete luck of the draw, the crib choices are interesting, as are the choices of which card to play.

I can see why many would play this game obsessively, but with so many other 2-player choices out there, I don't see myself ever really playing this all that much.  But if suggested, I would definitely play.

RATING: 8
This is one of the first games I ever learned, and I am glad that I recently rediscovered it as a valuable pastime. 

Gameplay is elegant and pretty easy to understand, plus many people already know how to play due to its classic nature. It's also quite portable, especially now that I have a pegboard app on my iPad (although there's definitely something special about using an actual pegboard). Even though there are newer, more finessed games out there in the world, I would still consider this an important game to know, and if I have kids, I still plan to teach it as one of their first games, if just to pass down the tradition. 

The only downside (and it's pretty minor) is that I always forget the order of play for when someone has a "go" during the pegging phase. I'm pretty sure I've played it wrong a couple of times, but as long as you're consistent I don't think it matters too much! 

But, a major upside (for me) is that it is a well-loved game among an older generation, and I've been able to form relationships with some folks I normally wouldn't game with, simply because I know how to play cribbage (and actually ended up winning a couple times). If you interact with different generations with any regularity, it's absolutely worthwhile to learn.

I've played my fair share of Cribbage over the years, mostly with my cousin while we were growing up. For some reason, even though the game is so random, I could rarely manage to beat him. We still had a lot of fun, though. It's been superseded for me by a lot of other card games, but I still play it a fair bit on my Palm. It saves dealing with the finicky scoring. My Palm tends to beat me as well. I guess I just suck at this game. Oh, and '29' boards are the coolest way to play.

I can still smell my grandpa every time I play the game.

This has become one of my wife's favorite games. We often play over breakfast and coffee in the morning. There is a good amount of skill when it comes to determining what to keep and how to play out a hand but if 2 players are equally skilled then luck will play a larger factor.

RATING: 8
Maybe the best traditional card game out there, at least to my taste.  While it is decidedly light, the hand management and card-play are engaging, and there are often real decisions to be made.

Very good with 2 or, in partnerships, 4.  3-player is good, but probably the weakest form of the game.

UPDATE: I've discovered some trick-taking games that are giving Cribbage a run for its money as a favourite card game to play with a regular deck. In fact Ninety-Nine has become one of my favourite games, period. I still like Cribbage a lot, but I'm seeing it in a broader context now.

It's a great pub game. There's a nice 'comfortable' feeling to this game once you know all the traditions. It'll only take a few games. Pour yourself and your buddy a drink, break out the cribbage board and deal. It's very relaxing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
For a long time I was under the impression this was a boring counting activity for idle geezers, but it's a great social game for two or in partnerships.

The regular three-player game drags and reduces the tactical space too much, but I've developed a three-player variant, [i]Part-time Partners[/i]: Non dealers score in tandem for card play but individually for hand points. Deal 5 cards each player and 1 to the crib. Players pass 1 each to the crib. The player to the dealer's right leads the first card. Deal rotates after each hand. It's not as good as two-handed, but I prefer it to the usual there-handed game.

Other variants I'll play again include "Lowball" (first to 61 loses) and Cribbage Squares (or a commercial equivalent, like [thing=5146][/thing]) for four. The [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cribbage_Solitaire]4-deal memory-based solitaire variant[/url] is pretty good for solitaire -- I much prefer it to the random dummy solitaire variants.

Although it's completely unrelated, [i]Scopa di Quindici[/i] ("sweep 15"), might also be of interest to some Cribbage fans for the tactical play to create sets of cards that add to 15.

I enjoy cutthroat games, but I've adopted my late grandfather-in-law's view that "muggins" (claiming points missed by your opponent) isn't fun.

Recommended: Any of Barlow's Cribbage books. One is enough -- there's a lot of overlap among them, but they're very good.

Many a Euro train trip has been spent playing Cribbage. I have about 12 different boards, in different sizes. I take the "travel size" with me to the EU (it's about 5" x 7" total). The only problem is the cards sliding all over the wobbly train tables. Good fun anywhere! Always play "Muggins"!

The first game that I ever learned to play that wasn't "Go Fish". I would walk into my grandparents place, when I was five or six years old, and go straight to the cupboard with the crib board and cards and challenge my grandpa--if he was in the house--or my grandma, if he wasn't. I didn't even say "hello" to them.

I love hand management so it's almost a given that I would love cribbage.  Each hand you have to decide how to allocate your hand - which 2 cards should go to the crib (and those decisions will vary depending on who's crib it is) and which 4 cards are worth keeping for your hand.  After the hand starts, you have to decide when to play certain cards for your hand for scoring opportunities.  

Still a rookie at this, but there appears to be a decent amount of skilled play in this.  I learned how to play against an app.  The medium level still stomps on me regularly and I haven't tried the hardest difficulty yet.  The app also allows you to analyze your moves in the game.  It shows which moves you should have made instead because they have a higher statistical chance of scoring points and shows the average amount of points it would typically score.

Read the rules carefully for first time players, they can be a little overwhelming.

Perfect blend of luck and skill. Plus there's the ritualistic counting, which must be done in proper fashion. In fact, it's positively galling to play with someone who doesn't count 'right' even if they endup with the right score.

Cribbage, a great card game that is popular in New England.  Yes, as with most 52 deck card games there is a prominent level of luck with drawn cards, however there is a good level of strategy in how you should play them.  A good alternative to Rummy.  Cribbage is highly re-playable. I'll never turn down a game of cribbage especially when the electricity is out or the snow is high.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Score points through a selection of your own cards: pairs, combos, etc.; but you'll have to use the same cards in a back and forth numbers game (pegging) to score against your opponents.

Played as: 2,3,4 player

Pros: Readily accessible components that are easy to travel with. I really like the mix of simple, but heavily considered, hand-management followed by a round of back and forth interaction between you and your opponent. The number of ways you score your points gives your mind enough to juggle so there's seldom time to slip into a 'cruise-control' like state. 

Cons: Loses a lot of its tight back and forth nature with three or four players and I'd probably rate it a '5' with those numbers. The game still has a fair amount of luck and players of near equal strength should trade wins regularly. And also when luck does make itself known by one player gaining a good lead with a good hand, there's the scoring track to remind you that some of the tension is sapped out.

Other: I tend to like any card game that isn't an ordinary rummy variant. This definitely struck a positive cord as I've only just been introduced to cribbage. I'm really surprised this isn't played more widely (relatively speaking). I was excited to start playing with three or four (teams) people but was disappointed that a somewhat dry game just got drier. I think I hit a temporary burnout level after a week or so of playing a few times every day.

Best Use: A simple two-player, non-threatening abstract card game that would fit in most any setting.

I know there is a fair bit of luck in this one. And yes, there are games where you are dealt cards so bad, you have no hope of winning. However, there is enough skill here ("pushing and pulling" the scoring so that you are either on crib with the right distance or close to the end and going first that I have to say I have always enjoyed this game. It certainly is one of my top 10 two player games. If that makes me a lilyliveredlucklubber then fine.

THE great two-player card game. The peg board scoring, which adds immeasurably to the pleasure of playing, was a stroke of genius. However, the scoring is surprisingly complicated for a traditional game. In fact, stealing a scoring chance your opponent overlooks in his/her own cards is actually part of the game, if you're playing ruthlessly. [165 plays]

A couple offshoots: [i]Cribbgolf[/i] (7) comes with a beautiful board and is a lot of fun; it's interesting the way it rewards playing [i]Cribbage[/i] a bit differently than you normally would. [i]CrossCribb[/i] (4) on the otherhand, is a bit of a bore.

RATING: 5
The odd scoring, very simplistic gameplay, and liberal dash of luck makes me doubt the quality of this game.  But, after the tedious process of learning to count quickly you fall into a pattern of leisurely reading your enemy and grinding away at the points.

Not a bad way to waste an afternoon.

Played this a few times with a friend in university. As far as traditional card games go, it's a pretty good one.

Cribbage boards also prove really useful as alternate scoring tracks for games with inadequate ones....

RATING: 8
I love playing cribbage. It isn't perfect, but very enjoyable to play in a coffee house or other relaxed setting. Plus all you really need is a deck or cards and pen/paper (if you don't have a fancy board). Some of the team and additional player variants are nice.

I rate this a 9 more for the sentinmental value I have for this game. My grandpa taught it to me growing up and I would always play with him when I saw him. I still play this with my dad quite frequently and while my win ratio is probably 50% I still enjoy every game that I play.

I was tought cribbage by my grandma, who's no longer with us, when I was about 14 or 15.

It's been most frequently played by us as two teams of two with my wife and my mum and dad, who was always a huge fan of crib.

Sadly Dad passed away in 2005.

It's hence a game that will always hold special memories for me.

Good game, easy to bring along on road trips.  I've actually scored a 29.  (5,5,5,J in your hand and a 5 comes up in the same suit that matches the J in your hand).  It happened when I was in the hospital with my daugher who had menegitis.  Won't ever forget that, it was scarry.  Unfortunatally, in hospitals it's a waiting game and a plethra of time on your hands.

Some nice memories playing this with my mom and dad and the game isn't particularly bad it's just that outside of the sentimental value I have no real desire to count 15-2 15-4 15-6 anymore.

Classic game of drawing cards, discarding one into a kitty, then playing them out one at a time to earn points. Points are scored for straights, flushes, pairs, triples, 4 of a kind and summing cards up to 15. After playing out cards you score points as well, and one player gets to score the kitty. 

It's a fun game, but there is a lot of luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Solid old card game that can be played without the board if needed. Also plays fairly quickly and can be stopped and returned to which makes it a great time filler when not at home. More luck than strategy if both players are reasonably skilled although the pegging phase can present interesting tactical decisions.

Feel like there is a Nash equilibrium in this one. There's still a few interesting decisions at the very end as you approach 121 points as to whether to play defensively or not.

It always amazes people who don't play cribbage much when you beat them utterly at a game that, on the surface, looks to be all luck. Cribbage is one of my favorite games. I've played 3-man all day while camping and drinking beer. I've played it on the beach in Mexico on my honeymoon. I've played it for hours on end with my brother at a pub. I will play cribbage any time, anywhere, until I physically can't play anymore. Yes, there is still a large luck component, but it is one of my favorite ways to pass time.

RATING: 10
In this old but perennially fresh game two players have got to discard two cards from a hand of six to build a crib of four cards that the dealer will keep, then play out their remaining cards in four tricks searching for special melds or values, and finally score their hands again individually before the dealer does so with his crib. 

Using very small hands of cards drawn at random, Cribbage demands gut feeling rather than strategic thought. However, the amount of hands for each round is considerable, and with luck evened out the most skilled or experienced player will nearly always win (since play stops immediately when the score goal is reached sometimes a player won't have a chance to equal... and it will have been his own fault for lazying before).

The hands in a round are as said many and quick, and thus they can be incredibly varied. There is no downtime at all during play, and both risky choices and mistakes come up continuously making Cribbage an absolute pleasure, a game that can be played twice as a filler or during a whole evening. Mandatory for card game aficionados.

My rating may go up if I discover more strategy. Right now it seems the gist of it is that you can't control how many points you score in your hand, but you need to maximize your play score and your crib score to overcome the luck element. Still luck seems a bit high. But a great 2-player game nonetheless.

[b]Cribbage[/b]

[i]Lots of great memories from playing with my pepere and my dad. 
In my opinion the best 2 player card game you can play with a poker deck. 

Worst Cribbage moment: Playing with my dad I get dealt four 5's. Awesome, highest odds of getting 28, all I need is a 10 or face card. Didn't get one!

Best Cribbage moment: Fast forward a few years. Playing against my dad I get dealt three 5's and the queen of spades. The 5 of spades got cut! 28 points! (If I had the Jack instead of the Queen I would have scored 29.)

We both now have a framed picture with the cards and a photo of us holding the board; a great moment I got to share with my dad.[/i]

I played with a friend who was really hardcore with this game. Had probably played hundreds of hours of it with his family. I think it might be an acquired taste. I don't play traditional card games 2p much (ever?), nor do I have much of a need or desire.

2014: my friend gave me one of his many Cribbage boards he had lying around, after he found one preparing to move to MT (I'll miss you Burke).

IF my wife would be willing to learn a pure card game, I might play this again - but its kind of wonky, so I doubt she'll ever want to.

So this big fat cribbage board, which I'll never be able to part with, takes up weird space in my game room shelf. Uggh.

Plays really well with all player counts, although 5 is a bit weird. For such simple rules, this game has a serious amount of replayability. Also, if you play it enough, you can figure out what opponents have in their hand.

Other than briefly in my pre-teen years, I never really got into this game, and it's still low on my list of card games.

One of the all-time great two-players whose greatness hinges on playing many consecutive games against one player.  Some double-bluffing and outwitting goes on with the crib draw, and, of course, a bit of luck in the top card flip and initial deal.  But it evens out quickly over just a few games and ultimately relies on the luck/outwit/chaos aspect.  Very quick with experienced players.

I was introduced to this game by an english gentlemen who was guest at a friends place. I couldn't believe when he told me that I was going to lose with almost no chance to recover when he was 6 points behind in the last quarter of the game and then he soundly beat me although I clearly had better hands during the endgame (but had no clue about positional advantage)! This seems to be the best 2 player classical card game I ever ever learned (but not even remotely mastered), and I had never heard about it before!

I don't own a cribbage board at the moment; when I play, I use ScoreKeeper XL on my iPhone to keep score.

As of May 15, I have a cribbage board.

We learned Cribbage around the same time as Gin Rummy, and played them about equal amounts for a while, but Cribbage has a much higher ratio of shuffling to playing-time, so eventually Gin Rummy won out.

When I want to know if I should take someone's game review seriously, I look at some of their other game reviews. It's often most telling how they rate Cribbage (if they play Cribbage).  Cribbage is a great game, and I'm beginning to appreciate it more and more.  The whole idea of the game never appealed to me and when I attempted to learn the game on my own, I found it a little difficult.  When I first played it, I didn't think there was much skill involved.  Now that I play regularly and read one good book about the game (and bought other books), I can see how to improve my play.  What this means to me is that if someone is dismissive about the game, they don't have a mature view of the game.  And, perhaps that carries over into the reviewer's other reviews.
Despite what I've said above, Cribbage is not my favorite game.  But, by playing it, I've come to a new realization: that winning or losing isn't the important thing, it's doing the best with what you've got that matters.  Cribbage involves a lot of luck, and in many cases it can outweigh the skill.  But, the good Cribbage player plays each hand for that one extra point and is happy when she gets it. At the end of ten games, the stronger player will win.
That type of thinking has made me more resilient.  I've learned to apply the thinking of Cribbage to my own life.  I've learned that some days just aren't good, but I look for that extra point each day that makes everything better.  This I owe to Cribbage.

I haven't come across many really good 2-player standard card games, and I think this is one my wife and I will be playing for years to come. There's enough to it to reward a skilful player, and the peg-board and bizarre terminology ("one for his nobs") really enhance the experience.

Probably the most ADDICTIVE game using standard playing cards that exists. I don't know of anyone upon learning this game that hasn't become hooked at least for a while. But like so many games, there are only so many combinations and pretty soon the decisions become automatic.

Quick; not a brain crushing game, played by many inexperiance gamers. Even if people are seeing this game as a mostly chance game, I think that strategy as an important role to play.

I played this a lot as a kid and a little as an adult (when I learned the rule where you can cheat when pegging your score).  It was fun when I was young, but not so special anymore.  I think the cheat rule gives it a "take that" element, which I don't like.  And if you play nice (no cheating), that works a little better, but still nothing truly special.

RATING: 6
I've played a decent bit of cribbage during my time in the boy scouts and growing up. It's a fine card game with a bit of strategy, but ultimately is rather confuses me. There are a lot of rules in cribbage such that it is not intuitive or easy to score or learn, yet tons of non-gamers will play this and like it. It's one of those games that makes me question how it continues to sell so well when really there are lots of other games people should be getting instead that they'd probably like more. Then again I suppose a standard deck of cards is familiar and Cribbage is one of the best options if that's all you have. 

Ah well. I've had my fair share of fond memories playing this game and I have no complaint about playing from time to time.

Quite possibly the world's most perfect 2p card game. Took a few plays to let everything sink in, and it's hard because nothing else is really like Cribbage to help you along as you learn it, but there's a lifetime of enjoyment here. A wonderful game, and one that we have welcomed into our 2p repertoire. We very quickly have anointed "one game of Cribbage, one game of Innovation, and a few beers" as our ideal mid-week card night.

I hated this game at first... seemed too random. No not random, it seemed arbitrary. Score points here and there but not this way! After a while it grew on me as I started to contemplate the probabilities in draws, etc. The dislike I have with this game is that one can play perfectly with the cards they get and still lose. This concept does not sit well with me.

Among the best traditional card games (at least of the lighter ones - nothing can touch Bridge for serious play) - and I used to be a big fan of traditional card games, but that's faded as I've got into "designer" games, BGG style. Certainly one of the 2 or 3 best 2-player games in this category - and also pretty unique among such games as far as mechanics is concerned. Cribbage really doesn't play like any other game - traditional or modern - that I know, and if we had never discovered BGG and the amazing variety of modern games out there, I'm sure my wife and I would still be playing this with some regularity. As it is, I can't really see us playing it again.

Half the fun is knowing the 700 ways to score and all of the funny sounding names for them ;)

Not a bad game really, large swings in the score that can heavily favor the dealer so timing & board position is important to your decisions from hand to hand. Really feels like 2-3 games mashed into one.

I've played this for decades with parents and grandparents, but after discovering so many other games over the last 10 years, my opinion of this has really fallen.  Players don't have much influence over the outcome of this game - it just a matter of picking the highest point total out of your hand and seeing how the cards fall.  Still, this can be played without requiring much attention, so it works as a social game.

I'm pretending Crib is a very accessible card game. Is this true? I think it could be, but sometimes I'm not the best judge, seeped in games experience as I am. Was hard on crib for many years, somewhat dismissive of its followers, looking at it as a game for half-senile old men who couldn't grasp a game of regular complexity...but then, then only recently I lost a game of this to a non-gamer. How was this possible? while reading a strategy article on the game to try and understand my loss, the author talked about how you should be able to pinpoint exactly what cards the other player has early on into the pegging, and I was like "whaaat? Of COURSE you would be able to! Wow, interesting...mmm, I have to get into this one now, that opens up bluffing as well (evidently called 'traps' in crib)..."

So here I am, many months later, fancy $25 board in hand, all into making 'par' and stealing the initiative...

This is another of the standard card games that I really like.  I know I've played loads and loads of this over the years.  Even though there is a heavy amount of luck involved, there is also room for some skill and deduction.  A wonderful 2-player game.

[3000+ plays]

I wonder if other people share the following experience, unique to cribbage for me:

My Dad, Uncles, Grandfather, and Great Uncle all played this game with me, my siblings, and cousins. They played tough. They insisted that we learn to count accurately and very quickly, and would sometimes take the points from our mistakes after we reached a level of play at which they deemed us fair victim. As we became good at the game and started to really enjoy it, they would also playfully cheat sometimes. 

All of these men were scrupulously honest individuals - in their lives and in their play of all other games. But cribbage seemed to be an exception in many ways - and I get the feeling they were teaching us all the importance of math and watching other people's math with some tough love through enjoyable games of cribbage.

When I met the girlfriend who eventually became my wife, I was delighted to find out she knew how to play cribbage. We played many games in our early months of dating - and learned a lot about each other in the process.

Most recent play Father's Day '16.

A sentimental favorite. I have been playing this game since I was a kid. It look simple, but to play it well you really have to strategize and think ahead. Some amount of odds-making (what is the likelihood of your opponent having a particular card) comes into it as well. Alas, like all card games, there is a big luck-of-the-deal factor.  I own four different boards. This is a great rainy day cabin game. great for teaching kids to add and to think!

RATING: 7
A classic, quick playing card game that involves a ton of luck, but just enough skill that unless they get screwed the better player will usually win. We don't play it super often any more, and there are numerous other two player card games I would rather play, but if my dad offered a game of crib at his house I certainly wouldn't turn down the opportunity to lose to him again. The nostalgia factor is high with this one.

Just learning to play in January 2016.  Only counting plays against another person.  Not logging games played against the computer. My husband played this against his father for years and is willing to play this any time so it gets to the table much more often than my other games.  We play 2-player, 3-player with our grandson, and 4-player teams with our friends.

Our favorite card game. We actually learned this later than most people. I learned the game from a couple classmates in grad school, and then taught Michelle. It's the game we've been playing together the longest, and still the one we play the most often. 

Recently, I started trying to improve my game and realized that there is a lot more to think about than is initially apparent. It is still mostly luck (probably about 2/3 for people that know what they're doing), but there's enough skill to make it interesting.

I've tried this game a couple of times and can't seem to get into it. Too fiddly for what it is, and not that interesting, cribbage seems to be a game that is played out of tradition or habit, or lack of good alternatives. I admit that cribbage boards are kind of cool.

Without doubt the best card game out there. Can play 2, 3 or 4 handed (also in teams of 2). Originally learned this palying with my parents as a kid, and have now taught my wife and kids as well.

So easy to pick up and there is a certain amount of stragety as to which cards to keep and which to throw in your (or opponants 'box') in readiness for the turn card.

Sadly been usurped in recent times by the popularity of the far inferior poker.

Cribbage is a game I have played with family since I was very young. In the game, each player attempts to complete two circuits (on a standard board) by leapfrogging two pegs. Pegs are advanced by playing cards. Card distribution has a Blackjack-like feel to it, and allows each player to influence the course of the game. Cribbage has a strong luck component, but skill also plays a role. In some ways, Cribbage reminds me of Backgammon: a classic game where skill is important, but where there is also a bit of luck. Cribbage plays quickly, is fun, and prompts further play.

One of the best traditional two-player card game in my opinion.  (Two-handed pinochle is also pretty sweet.)  The game plays quickly between two experienced players and the decisions usually break down to one of two options, but I feel that there is more skill in getting those two options established than simply waiting for the deck to produce the card you need like in rummy.

I especially enjoy the portion of the game scoring to 31 as you react to the plays of your opponent.

RATING: 8
The best two player game with a deck of 52, and simply one of the best two player games in existence, period.  There is a reason that this has stood the test of time.

Components - 1/1 For public domain games, it is implied that you can acquire as nice of pieces as you could possible want.

Fun - .7/1 I've enjoyed the game but when facing someone who seems to have the best of luck with cards, it can be a little frustrating. It's easy to play and it plays relatively quickly. You don't even need more than deck of cards and some scratch paper (though a nice board makes the experience better).

Replayability - .9/1 Extremely dependent on cards that are provided each hand and what the other player plays. This means that each game tends to be pretty different. When you play enough there tends to be some sameness depending on what you have in your hand.

Strategic - .5/1 There's a lot of tactics for the playing, but at the same time, it seems a bulk of the time you are at the mercy of the cards. First player definitely has the best chance of creating a strategy, and with some luck can pull off some traps, but since the opponent isn't likely to have what you'd need, more times than not there's little more than 1 or 2 obvious plays each choice. Then again, when a bait works, it can be satisfying.

Theme - 0/1 There is none that I've ever been made aware of.


Personal Review - 3/5 Good card game that can easily be taught and played almost anywhere. The game is definitely a easy to teach difficult to master sort of game. At the same time, the "mastering" of the game still depends on a fair amount of luck on the shuffle/opponent's play. It will always be a great intimate game experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A neat classic card game with a lot of randomness but clearly also a lot of room for skillful play. I like the decisions you have to make both in which cards to discard to the crib, and how to play your hand out. I also like the little mini-puzzle of figuring out all the scoring combinations you've got in your hand (and the face up card), although after a lot of play I guess this would become second nature?). But the constant shuffling and dealing could be even more annoying than Dominion! 

Look forward to trying this more.

Other than Briscola, this is the best 2-player card game, ever. Never play with 3! Quick and smart. See very little of the deck each hand, but can go for a couple different combinations in striving for points. The crib which both players contribute to, but only one gets each hand, is wonderful element as it creates tension about what you want to add to it.

Likely the game I've played the most of.  All you need is a deck of cards and a way to keep score.  Good for 2, 3, or 4 players, this might be the ultimate card game.  The "cost per game" for this one long age went below 1c.

On first play, everyone I teach Cribbage to, tells me "That's it?!" On repeat play, they all begin to understand the subtle strategies in this classic two-player. There is luck, certainly, but trying to force your opponent to play a particular card or agonizing over which cards to discard into the crib is very enjoyable.

RATING: 5
Cribbage can be fun in certain circumstances (like when you can't get the other guy to play something else), but I haven't played enough to make it seem anything other than luck-driven.  On the plus side, you get to occasionally say weird stuff like "I score one for His Nobs," or "I get two for His Heels."

Cribbage (crib) is a good game - but as 4 playing as partners (especially if you both are partners in real life) it is a great game.
Easy to learn although a couple of diversionary rules, you can be up and playing in 10 minutes to enable you to have games in reserve for NG friends/family

Fun two-player game. Very simple: get six cards, pick four to keep, then take turns playing one card at a time. It's interesting that a very big part of the game involves just picking which cards to keep. There's a whole lot of luck, but that's fine with considering that a round just takes a few minutes.

I have an oddly low rating for a game that I estimate that I've played over 3,000 times and will likely play another few thousand times.

I enjoy the game, but much of my joy comes from the thousands of hours I've spent playing with my Grandpa and Dad.  

As a game there are many I prefer, but my Dad has only ever really liked this game for two. (though he now likes Daytona 500 too!). 

I would say that it is the best two-player game you can play with a standard deck of cards and that it is equally enjoyable with three or four players.

So my rating should really be more of a 6, but the memories and fun I've made with this game boost it higher than it should be.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2


Overall - 4

As a veteran two player cardgamer, Cribbage is a good and funny game, but there are more interesting cardgames, w/standard deck for two IMO (Slam, Bridgette or Jo.Jotte). Cribbage is really funny and varied, very good to play relaxly with your partner, but I don't see too strategy here. Too lucky to my taste, and you have not any idea about your partner hand so is not posible any planning or strategy to take. It seems purely tactic, and often is trivial the card to play.

A very good couple's game that balances skill and luck, which can be easily played on an airplane or almost anywhere.

That being said, it can almost be played on auto-pilot once you're reasonably experienced.  I find myself having to adapt to my opponent's play just a bit more in Lost Cities than in Cribbage.

A variant that works quite well is to allow the player who will get the crib the option, after both players see their cards, to instead declare that both players will retain all six of their cards in hand (no crib) and then play and score that hand normally.  This rule adds more VPs, potential catch-up, and an extra dimension to the strategy of the game.

It can also be played 3-player or as a partnership game for 4.  I rank it a 7 in those configurations.

I'm a fan of traditional card games, but this is an overrated one, in my opinion; very few interesting decisions.  I think that most of the love is really for the cool boards.  Not only are they ubiquitous, but there are tons of different shapes, sizes, and styles.  Cribbage [i]boards[/i] are cool, and moving your pegs around on them are fun.  But how popular would this game be if the dominant way of playing involved keeping score on a pad of paper?

All that said, I wind up playing this game a fair amount with Allison's family (and used to play a lot with just Allison, in college) and I don't completely hate it, so that's something.  A noncommittal 5.

This is probably my favorite traditional card game.  I like planning for the crib at the beginning of the hand whether I'm in possession of it or not.  I like how you can score points from flipping over the first card, through playing out your hands, to digging through your cards at the end.

And there's something about a nice cribbage board that just makes me want to move pegs all over it.  In fact, I suspect my love of racing games encompasses Cribbage, since one could say that it's a racing game as well.

Initially introduce by a college girlfriend, I really got into this by playing Hoyle's Book of Games on DOS-based PCs. This later drove me to want my own board. For someone who is not a fan of poker or 21, this is one of the great playing-card games, and my favorite in that genre.

Just recently was taught how to play. Wasn't sure about it at first and found it a bit confusing because of the various ways to score points, but the more I play the more I enjoy it. I'm also figuring out strategies that can help me win more consistently.

Find it boring.  Usually relegated to doing this when I've got nothing else to do while camping with my wife's family.  Not bad times, but not really exciting.

I did many dangerous and irresponsible things in my formative years, and playing cribbage was one of them.

Truthfully, and I say this with affection as a former fan, the world's population of cribbage-lovers could be converted into modern gamers if only someone could talk them into playing something (anything!) else.  A card or board game with a bit less luck, perhaps.

There certainly isn't a card game with [i]more[/i] luck, I don't think.

Another great gambling card game.  I love the confused state that onlookers fall into when they attempt to decipher the game with all its 15 for twos and double runs for eight.  Certain moments, like the tension of trying to peg enough points in play so as not to get skunked and have to pay double money, can bring the game close to a poker-esque feel... but not quite.

This used to be the single most frequently played game by my wife and I. Even as we have moved more into other games, cribbage is still occasionally played. 

I like the quick play, the multiple use of one hand of cards, the ebb and flow of the game, even it somewhat predictability is appealing in the right mood. Also good for couples as it is non-confrontational.

Cribbage has to be one of my all time favorite games.  I have cribbage boards at home, at work, in my car, and in my camping box, so that I can play whenever the opportunity presents itself.  I see cribbage as a metaphor for life.  Games are rarely the same, and it is always challenging to figure your hand, and out-guess your opponent.  The only thing that keeps Cribbage from being a 10 is that I meet fewer and fewer people who know how to play.

Trick-taking games are very much not my forté.

RATING: 8
I love older games full of arcane phrases and terms, and espically love card games removed from "trick taking." Cribbage fits the bill on both counts. Just the right mixture of luck and skill, divided up into phases that account for pure intuition (the play), pure luck (the show), and a little of both (the crib). And don't you just love making your opponent say "one for his nobs" when the Jack matches?

This is by far my favorite "traditional" card game, and has been a staple of my gaming life since I was a wee lad. Wonderful blend of strategy and outguessing your opponent -- do you play the strength of your cards, or your opponent's tendencies? I've easily played more games of cribbage over the course of my life than any other game.

In memory of my dear Baba. Ohhh, she could play a mean game of cribbage. My original 'the cards speak for themselves' game. It never felt fair to score points because your opponent wasn't as adept at seeing them.

Fantastic card game. I've been playing this since I was 8. Sure, there's luck in what you are dealt but there's also strategy involved. I'm always up for a game!

RATING: 7
It's about time that I learned this classic.  I enjoyed the two plays I got in (with one ended in a tight 121-120 score) and there seemed to be some subtlety in the passing to the crib as well as the card play itself.  However, since only 13 out of the deck is used each hand, the randomness of what you're dealt with is a lot more pronounced then any strategy you can employ.  A lot of times you just don't have the right combination of cards to work with.  I'd like to try Cribbage with 3-players to see if it adds any depth to the game.

I decided I needed to learn this after living in the Midwest for about a year.  It is a nice two-player card game.  I imagine you could play this quite intensely if you were any good at counting cards or such.  With my wife and I, however, it is pretty casual.  Fun, but I prefer more recent two-player card games (see Odin's Ravens or Battle Line).

Mostly RoboRally with some Ricochet Robot for good measure. All stripped down to knife-fight proportions. Great fun!

RATING: 8
Everything I've been looking for in a simultaneous action game (except perhaps that it only works for 3 - 4 players)... 

simple to teach, quick to play.  It's all about reading the other players and out-figuring them.  Nice components but not over the top.  It's everything I was hoping for.  

Initial Rating: 8 with upward mobility

RATING: 8
Like a non-random, quick version of Robo Rally: you race around the board tagging up on flags, while shooting your opponents with a regular gun or a variety of specialized equipment. Tag a flag, score a point; destroy an opponent (don't worry, they respawn), score a point. Simple, yet there is a strong bluffing element that keeps it from being predictable.

A good introduction to the programmed movement genre.

This is a great game. The tension and fun in the game comes from knowing that you and your opponents have a full list of options available to you. this leads to everyone trying to guess what the other will do.

the game can start basic and then get more complex as players know the rules, you can add special powers and play in teams.

this is such a hit among my group that we arranged a tournament with double elimination which ended in a championship match among the 4 best players. great fun!

RATING: 4
1. Try to push people into pits near VP spot.
2. Go for VP spot last
3. Shoot at others who go for VP spot from afar.
4. Charge snipers of VP spot and try to shoot them first.
5. Shoot at others who are shooting at each other for last hit.
6. Sneak to VP.
7. Repeat meta 1-6. Maybe add special powers.

Programming + double think. Feel pretty random like rock paper scissors. Fiddly to resolve action order. I'd rather play other games for the fun double think. Lasts longer than it should. No penalty for suicides.

RATING: 8
I would almost put this game in the "party game" category just because of how many fun moments there are in each game.  Its almost like a bluffing game, or trying to second guess opponents.  No matter how surprising I think my turn will be, someone already assumed I would make that move.  

A few of the special abilities are slightly wonky, but most of them are very fun and add to the game.  The little plastic robots were mediocre quality, but it doesn't really detract from an excellent game.

Fun... Until you realize that it's suicide to go for the goal, and that actually killing yourself in order to completely heal is game-breaking. Fortunately, there's plenty of power-ups to go crazy with, so I plan to play with those a bunch.

I really wanted to like this one but, just couldn't get into it at all.  I love the concept as it sounds like a blast.  Program robots and shoot the others.  However, it's just so boring to sit and wait in between each turn for everyone to program their robots.  Once everyone got one victory point, we wound up ending it because most of us were bored.  One person though in our group loved it so, this definitely does have its market, just 3 out of 4 of our group isn't it.

After playing it once, I really kind of wish there was an "adaptive" micro-version with perhaps just the rules + the player boards and screens (maybe the dice as well, but really, they could just be tiles). It would be great for those of us who already own the game roborally.

Too niche though, I suppose.

RATING: 9
Being a huge Robo Rally fan, this game immediately piqued my interest.  While it has some similarities with RR, it really is its own game, and I felt like I was in more control of my robot than in RR.  While I did enjoy the chaos of RR, I really liked that this game felt a more tactical.

The bots appear to be made of a pliable plastic (so no worries of them breaking), but are clearly the same bots right on the front cover.  The game boards are sturdy and have a nice linen finish that give it a big-brand feel.  The tokens are a bit thinner card stock, but no less durable looking.

So far I have only played it twice, but considering its quick play speed, and replayability factor, I think this will make it into my regular work lunch time game rotation.

RATING: 7
This game is fun. Most people will immediately compare it to RoboRally because of the programmed movement. But instead of your robots racing, they are fighting for space on the board. The programming mechanic is simple and effective. There is strategy and guessing what your opponent will do. The game is not random, but it can be somewhat chaotic. For me that makes the game fun because of the surprises that happen. The game is definitely best with four players when using the special power tokens. Not for everyone, but for the right people, this is a great little game.

Two pieces of advice: This is best with 4 players. And start using the special power tokens as soon as you can.

My rating is based on the assumption that you will always play the Expert Game option or the Expert Draft Match option.  It is those options that really add to the replayability of the game.  Without them, the game drops a point or two.

I hate the Jones Theory.  It's elitist bullshit at its finest, and no other form of entertainment tries it.  Infinite Jest does not replace Gravity's Rainbow.  Fall Out Boy does not replace Green Day.  The nuances are meant to be enjoyed.

I say that because VOLT completely, absolutely, 100% replaces Roborally for me.  Quicker, smarter, more controlled and yet still chaotic enough to keep you on your toes.  Such a fun little skirmish game.

Fantastic no-luck game!  It's sure to get into the minds of everyone there, trying to figure out what you're going to do and how to counter-act that.  ...or do you know what I'm thinking, and have a counter to my counter?  Such psychological warfare!  Great game!

I was surprised at how fun this simple little game was. I thought it would be more for a family context but ended up being quite great with some friends. They loved it so much that I gave them game as it wasn't available for purchase for a little while. Looking forward to the new edition - I think the game will have a lot more life with some tweaks, because the foundation is solid.

Programmed movement and battle game.  More intuitive than Roborally.

You select movement and weapons with a D6.  Low number goes first.

Fun game.  Someone chaotic, but you can anticipate where people will be and act accordingly.

Recommended.

A cute little programmed robot war game. It's a little bit shallow, and basically plays out like a long series of tactical puzzles on individual rounds. Nevertheless, it allows fun interactions and is generally amusing.

Program your robot's three moves.  Then everyone reveals their programming and then resolve the robots movement and firing.  You score points by ending your movement on a control point or you can just destroy your opponents robots by shooting them or pushing them into a pit.

The base game seems to go on too long. Players seem to maneuver around trying to anticipate each other and most points are from shooting other players than scoring flags.

I need to play with the special weapons.

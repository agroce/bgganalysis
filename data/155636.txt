This is NOT a lightweight game, think Twilight Imperium. If you have the time and the players to try and save the Earth from an alien invasion this game is for you.

Requiere exactamente 5 jugadores. Ni uno más ni uno menos. Pero si logras reunir a un grupo de 5 jugadores y jugar una partida el esfuerzo habrá merecido la pena. Es un juego muy entretenido. Con momentos realmente épicos.

Unboxed and assembled the boards.  Great looking components.  It's going to be a long game, so will play it this weekend so my rating will probable change.

Man, did I want to like this one a lot more than I actually did.  Excellent production quality (this is a Big Beautiful Box of Plastic), compelling theme (Aliens!  They're invading!  Stop them!), semi-co-op, what's not to love?

The pacing and the amount of decision making; they're issues.  Long stretches of this game passed while we resolved the marauding invaders' actions while making damned few meaningful decisions ourselves.  There were also a fair number of "decisions" that really boiled down to how to advance the game-winning superweapon and often had really obvious execution.  The semi-co-op mechanism is broken with anything other than five players, and is of dubious value to begin with; I don't think this game would lose anything by ditching its handful of "Screw your 'allies'" mechanisms and declaring you either lose or win as a team, even if for some of you it's posthumous.  This game is clearly meant for EXACTLY five players; you can play with fewer, but it's a graceless kludge.

Combine with the runtime (the box-stated 2-4 hours seems REALLY optimistic), and you're left with a game that I didn't HATE but didn't engage me enough to win my love either.  There were certainly tense and engaging moments, but I spent way too much time feeling like I had no power to influence what was happening.  If a friend was chomping at the bit to give this a spin, I'd gladly try it again.  But I'd rather spend the time playing two or three games I like better instead.

Nice semi coop game. Could come with a few more options, maybe a more interesting tech tree or some combat cards. Still, there are not many other strategy coops out there, so it´s definitely on my table now and then...

Reviewed on bgg- solid gameplay but fiddly execution, playtime, and replay. 2016 update: I haven't really thought about this game in a year. While I continue to love the design and layout I wish there was more here. Additional scenarios are needed, interesting objectives. 

Possibly better as a Solo game.

Very thematic if you're into the Level 7 series of board games. Very phase-heavy game which lengthens the game and increases complexity from other games similar to this theme and setup (Pandemic, Defenders of the Realm). Has resource management, dice combat, and some cooperative trading.

Concerned about replayability despite the randomization of events. The strategy and tactics may ultimately be the same for every setup. Requires the full player count to play or others have to manage multiple colation. Despite custom dice, the faces are very underwhelming.

Tentative 7, would have to replay to see if the puzzle holds up or is just another cooperative puzzle with dice roll drama.

Do NOT purchase this game! The pieces are made of the most vile smelling substance ever imagined! I was told to "air out" the pieces for a week. This did NOTHING! I received replacement pieces and these smelled just as bad! They were washed, soaked in vinegar over night, washed again and sprayed with a sealant and the smell is still overwhelming! It is vomit inducing that's how bad the smell is with the pieces!

As for the game itself, this is NOT a semi-coop game! There is one scenario and the order in which objectives meet is fixed in every game. There is little to no substantive decision space in this game.

The only way this game would work is like a boardgame version of the MegaGame Watch The Skies. It would need different scenarios, and actual nation objectives (ala Dead of Winter) that would require there to be some lack of cooperativity. As printed this is a one-trick pony game with no depth of decision space.

That's ignoring the smell!

Played at Gencon with designer. Game palys out so you can't actually "win" in the traditional sense of smashing your enemies, it's more about holding back the waves of invaders for an epic last minute victory over a ruined earth. Sounds good in theory, but not my cup of tea. It's a cut-throat co-op where others at the table can direct all the invaders into your country but you won't know who did it. If you are eliminated after completing your nations objective, no one seems to care and you don't claim any of the victory if they go on to win because you're dead.

This is a good game, but there is probably too much going on.  Feels like it needs to be condensed and streamlined somehow.  Good theme and it definitely feels like you are under constant attack and clinging on.  Long at 3-4 hours.

Wow. I knew the theme and overall concept of the game was going to appeal to me, but I was very pleasantly surprised at how clean and fast-moving the gameplay turned out to be.

As others have said, this is very much a 5-player game, I could see the upkeep being tedious with fewer players, but our group unanimously enjoyed our first outing. 

I also agree that if players are not fully cooperating, the Aliens will crush them quickly. We found that trading massively smoothed things out for players who were getting hit early on, and gave them a chance to recover.

Can't wait to play it again.

I agree with 'Nate Stratton "This is a good game, but there is probably too much going on. Feels like it needs to be condensed and streamlined somehow" 
Game time objections could of been fixed with some condensing and streamlining too.

A quick reference sheet would sure of been nice with 15 steps in a round !!!! Geez
But unfortunately the rule book IS the quick ref.

Glad Callasmar made a utube game-play series. 
Cleared up some questions of play. 
 
Don't care for xcom so 'Invasion' will have to do...

After a video review: Interesting, but could be long. Requires a lot of players and the semi-coop game is broken. Will need to play but not sure it I could buy this game. Seems pretty big too.

This looks and feels a lot like the planetary defense portion of the XCOM video game, with the massive scope, reacting to different threats and upgrading your technology. And it does a great job of capturing every aspect of it's theme, however this has the knock on effect of making this a fairly complex and potentially long game. Players each take control of one of five differently themed nations which works really well, unfortunately if you play it with a lower player count the unused nations need to be divided amongst the everyone which can make it overly complicated.

This isn't a bad game by any means, but it won't get many plays from me due to the length and the amount of easy-to-overlook upkeep.

This game really wants to be a computer game, where the computer keeps track of the many status updates that happen throughout the course of a turn.

The decisions that one makes (what to buy/research, who to trade with, how much to contribute to group goals, combat choices, etc) are all really good and there are a lot of them, but there is just so much upkeep.

For example, for each alien you want kill you need to figure out the relative power rating, roll the die, remove the relevant mini from the board, update a dial, check to see if they get an advance, pull an advance if applicable. The advance can then add more minis to the board or update the power level of the bad guys. Wow! 

With a computer nearly all of that would have been automatically handled. With humans it's a lot of atomic tasks that need to be handled in order and all of which are easy to miss.

I do like the game, and if it comes out as a computerized multiplayer game I will play it, but the board version is just beyond my desired complexity level for tracking game state.

This is a really fun dudes on the map meets pandemic game. The idea is that each player controls a country, and alien ships invade and drop troops, which pop like pandemic out, spreading invaders across the board. Players need to work together, trading resources, assisting with troop support, and walk the alien-turned-traitor-to-his-people scientist around the map completing his super weapon project to stop the invasion thereby letting the players win. We had a fantastic time with the game. It was hard, but due to some part luck and some part smart plays we won. Here's the strange thing. Although everyone had a great time, we sort of felt like we had seen what this game had to offer in just one play. Everyone felt satisfied, but nobody including myself thought they would feel like playing it again in the future. Interesting, I don't think I've ever encountered a game like that.

Mechanically, Thematically, and Cooperatively one of my favorite games hands down. If you like complexity, strategy, and cooperative games THIS is the game.

A couple of points I would like to address:

1. THIS is a VERY long game, Especially if you play with just 2 players like I did. Be prepared to clear out 3-6 hours. 2-4 hours is for full 5 people who know what they're doing.

2. There is a LOT that is going on in the game, BUT ITS NOT HARD. You may be swayed by the fact that other reviewers keep commenting about how this game needs to be streamlined or there's too many things going on, but as I stated earlier if you enjoy complexity this is actually a +. Also, it's worth noting the "upkeep" isn't long  unless you have AP, or Analysis Paralysis.

3. "Semi-Cooperative" I fail to see why this game even has this label, it's a cooperative game put down and simple. If ANYONE is working "just for themselves" game is over, you're all going to lose. Any nation that is destroyed before their objective is a loss for everyone, a nation that is destroyed after their objective is completed is still a blow (while not a loss) for everyone BECAUSE while alive they can still contribute to the war effort.

I've played this game 3x now. Solo, and two times with 2 player games and I would play it 50 more times. It plays like a cooperative advanced version of Risk. If you've played Pandemic, Risk Legacy/Godstorm/2210 A.D. imagine that style combined with a lot of resource management and then a Cooperative setting.

Thematically you really do feel like the aliens are going to wipe everyone out unless you do something. In the 3 times I have played no one is ever "ahead" but just doing "better" before they completely get stomped into the ground. You have no chance to win an all out fight, and the game feels that way.

Mechanically the game is super solid. Everything is paced so perfectly that by the time the game ends it's always a narrow victory. The 2 victories I've had, 4 nations died all converting forces together to hold off for the last turn, melding into one unified nation. It's awesome. Nothing out there like this that I know so far.

Alien invasions might have been done to death, but I'm not familiar with most of them, and this one looks really good. I'm not sure about the semi-coopness of it all, though. There are games that need that; I'm just not sure this is one of them.

This is an awesome game based off of my initial play.

There really is very limited cut-throat co-op... it is much more everyone against the game due to the brutal difficulty.

Imagine if Arkham Horror and Pandemic had a twisted child that wanted to destroy you, and you're getting close to the mechanics.  The nations must work together to trade resources and parley continuous disaster into snatching defeat from the brink of disaster.

Brutal, but fun.  Lots of options combined with a desperate need for luck at the right moments.  I've never been happier to see certain die results, and "crossing the pond" in a last ditch attempt to save Western Europe felt amazing.

GREAT GAME.  I can't wait to try this again.

Co-op sci-fi world map territory containment against the invading hydra alien race. Escalating AI responds to tech advancements with the assistance of Dr. Chronos. Simple fate-like combat system, event phase and lots of resource dials admin.

Good filler, optimal with 4 players, 6 is a bit overcrowded.

RATING: 4
Decent, if luckfest-ish race and bash-er. Docked a full point for the rules completely omitting the start player rotation method.  Game as printed is not remotely balanced/playable.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game, but far more complex rules than the limited gameplay should require. Seems to have more complex rules than its young audience should require, and doesn't yield the best gameplay within that. Could have been simpler, or harder, but instead reaches a place where it doesn't really have an ideal audience. 

Miniatures are cool though.

I got this because my daughter loves Wiz-War and in a way this gives the vibe of extremely pared down (extremely, mind you!) version of that game. It's fun! The rules are clean and clear. The production values are great. I love the art! And it's a tiny box. Fun game to play with kids.

It's okay.  Maybe roll.  Choose a die.  Move.  I honestly think I'd rather play almost anything else, but the game isn't really awful, just dull.

RATING: 6.9
It's a cute enough little brawling racer, with excellent artwork and fun character designs, but be aware that it's very compact. It's nice to have the six boards, each with their own environmental hazards, and the variable character powers, but it's a simple case of pushing forward across these boards and damaging or shoving others that you come across, repeating a number of laps, and voila. I wouldn't have minded this with larger boards, not that they're required but it's a little small when you've got multiple folks around a table. Still, not too hard to teach kids, with simple rules that make sense.

Monster 'dirty' race with 'take that' cards and powers, respawning and a 2D board that simulates a spherical planet to decide where you enter from when exiting the edges of the board in continuation of your movement to the finish. Neat idea, nice touch with the minis, etched dice and artwork. An ok game.

Vroommm Vrooommm. En fait, ca ferait plutôt Grroooaaarrrr Grooaaarrrrrr. Et c'est parti pour le lâcher de Titan. 3 Tours de piste, c'est juste ce qu'il faut pour gagner. Mais si on plus, on peut taper sur l'adversaire, le pousser dans la lave, sauter des tremplins, poser des pièges, c'est encore plus cool (et ça va vite être l'anarchie). Dommage, le plateau de jeu est un peu petit et on s'arrache les yeux. Grrooarrr Groooaarr

Mario Kart the board game.  Easy to teach and play, small box.  Little to no language dependence if you play with your hands open.

A light dice-racing game with a fun theme and cool special powers. A variety of characters and tracks gives this game a ton of replay value. And the characters' special powers and the bonus cards can create some interesting and humorous combinations.

Generally, I don't like this type of games but this one seems particularly bad. Maybe it's because we played with only 3 players. Actually not much was happening and we were just running forward with just a little interaction, so it was quite dull.

RATING: 5.681
Review based only on one two player game.  The art is nice, but the board and tokens are way too small.  There seems to be significant advantage in going first, and the game finished in starting order, with last place being lapped.  So, provisional review is a light, slightly too small, race game that I might try again as a filler.  But at the moment, nothing yet to want me to play again unless it is with some younger gamers, and to be honest I expect my gaming group to go 'Meh'. (Rating 6.136, Dec 2015). UPDATE: It just stays and goes stale on the shelf; sold (Rating 5.873, Jan 17).

basically a fantasy-themed board game adaptation of the popular video game Mario Kart. Nothing wrong with the game design......just I would rather play this as a video game.

I brought this to the pub the other day and we had a really fun time playing the game, the chain reactions are very fun especially on the ice map. And can be much more strategic than I originally thought mixing your dice outcome with your titans power and then use a weapon card causing chain reactions along the way. We all had a blast

RATING: 6
Pretty straightforward race with very nice colourful components if not for a slightly difficult to read map. The game in itself is quite random and it is designed for a beer and pretzels kind of experience where you alternate take thats and laughs for good humor. 
For the seasoned player there is little here to bring this title back to the table.

Titan Race is an adrenaline fuelled fun family game that has a little more to it that first meets the eye. The more players the better, it is a very light warm up game that provides laughs along the way.

Finally got this game played. I kinda lost my initial excitement upon seeing just how small the figures actually are, thus leading to it gathering dust. However, after having actually played the game, the size is ok. If the minis were bigger then you'd have a hard time properly fitting them on the board (like is the case with Tokaido's accessory upgrade pack). That being said, I wouldn't mind bigger boards. They be small!
The gameplay is fun but the silly kind of fun that's best shared with other people. So probably won't solo this again. I think it works best with 4-6 players.

Almost balanced, but not quite there.  I think the game needed a catchup mechanic of some kind to be perfected.

A nice game about killing your opponents repeatedly and pushing them in lava. 
The game is actually quite a lot of fun with the right group who really get into it. The map system works well. the miniatures are very nicely done as ive came to expect from fun forge. my only gripe woth the game is that if you are last off of the starting line, it can be a little hard to catch up and you may feel a bit duped.

I'm not a fan of racing games, typically, so take my rating with a grain of salt. This game is extremely simple. Almost too simple. It's like they wanted to make Mario Kart: The Board Game, which, in my opinion, was already done with Hod Rod Creeps. Basically in this game you roll dice that determine movement, and you draft them to move your titan around that board. Moving around the board is more confusing than it ought to be, but once you get your mind wrapped around it, it makes sense. I like that there are different tracks and racers with varying abilities, but this felt almost like a roll and move game. I will say, however, that the production for this game is fantastic. The components are few, but they're outstanding. Too bad the game play isn't there to back it up.

A game that, if you play it quickly (like most race games should be played) can be a lot of fun, but can get a bit tedious if play is dragged out by the presence of distractions or distracted players. 

As a small box funforge game, the storage solution and component quality is fantastic, but the rulebook is slightly subpar due to poor translation and suboptimal organization.

Filler racing game with a large take that element in the form of action cards and special abilities. Pretty chaotic, but I had a good time playing it at Essen 2015. I do need to be in the mood for such a silly racing game, but I think it offers good value for money and really like that it plays up to six players.

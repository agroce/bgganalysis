GAME: Say Bye to the Villains
RANK: 3004
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game is VERY UNDERRATED.  Seiji Kanai's games are great for their clean, thematic simplicity. Say Bye is one of his best. I like it for these reasons:

1) Awesome theme (vigilantes slaying crime lords)
2) SWEET artwork (Noboru Sugiura's stuff is so, so good)
3) Interesting yet simple mechanic (similar in many ways to Cheaty Mages)
4) Relatively quick playing time (30 min.)
5) Immersive co-op experience (discussing the encounters is incredibly fun)
6) Great replay-ability (I feel like playing it with every group of my friends, from serious gamers to casual ones)

This is a cool and unique game in one very tiny AEG box.

RATING: 6
Fun, quick coop that seems like it would prevent the alpha-gamer problem.  Has some similarities to Hanabi, which is a game I love.  Quite challenging.  I'd definitely like to play it more.

UPDATE (6-25-15): Now having bought the game and played it more, the game has lost some of its luster.  It feels much too random and frustratingly difficult.  It feels like you don't have nearly enough resources to guarantee a win.  Instead, it feels like the best you can do is maximize your resource usage and hope you don't get hosed by a card you weren't expecting.  It's really diminished my desire to play the game.

RATING: 5
Preliminary rating.  I don't get it.  There's so much hidden information, I feel I would need to have a really good idea of all of the cards in the deck in order to play passably.  Maybe it's a great game once you invest the time into that, but not sure it's my thing.

I found the theme of Say Bye... quite appealing. The players are a motley band of heroes, ranging from a samurai to a medium and an elderly inventor. The artwork is also nicely done in a style familiar from other character-based Japanese games.

However, I found the game play disappointing. For a 45 minute game there is surprisingly little variation in player turns (particularly for those whose characters have valuable specialisms); play resolves into revealing and dealing with situation cards and beefing up character abilities.  Work at that for 44 minutes and then in the final showdown a single high powered situation card can ensure your defeat. Hey ho.

Production quality of my AEG edition is good. The rules are readable and clear enough.

Marginally better than the worst new game I tried this month - I at least felt like we had a small dose of control over what was happening. But at a certain point you felt like, "Well - let's go for it because I don't think we can do any better." Being so uniformly trounced by the game didn't make any of us want to play it a second time.

Personally, after one play, I really liked it. The other two players were Grumpy and Sleepy, and liked it less. As a game, it is very simple and direct. The character pieces in the rules could have been left out in favour of one or two more examples or answers. Grumpy failed to understand that preparation cards could only be played during preparation, and saved some 'time' to spend during the showdown. He didn't understand what Reveal really meant and thought that turning the cards up in the showdown was also Reveal.

I got it but under-estimated the strength I needed. Sleepy got it and won his fight easily.

On balance, it's a good game. The text is tinier than it ought to be. The card stock is very good, the graphics are lovely. As a product, it's been well prepared and made.

Didn't like this much at all. High difficulty achieved almost entirely through high randomness. Oy.

Also, there is a reason a lot of the new co-op games have shied away from the 'give one player information and rule that he can't talk about' mechanic. It can be incredibly frustrating and leads to weird enforced alpha plays. Not a fan at all.

Only played once, and I don't want to give a rating, since I don't generally like cooperative games and would be giving a low rating that is undeserved, since this seems like a solid entry in the genre. The superhero theme comes through surprisingly strongly, while at the same time the core gameplay seems like a numbers puzzle a la Hanabi. I wonder how much the game play depends on limits on communication between players, I suspect a lot but am not sure.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2014)

As it is an AEG game, I didn’t have a high expectation, but it is a fun cooperative card game (with the right crowd). I really dig the art.  I prefer to play it with three or four players. I won’t even try to play it with eight. I also like the limited communication, in theory it’s great, in practice I found my teammates broke this rule very easily, I will try to enforce it more harshly next time but I’m afraid some of them are unable to follow this directive. I kind of like the theme. The use of the time units is brilliant. It is what saves the game for me, thank to this, the game has a slim chance to go up in my personal ratings. I’m still undecided if the game is too obvious or not, for now I’m leaning toward obvious decisions.

The game can be hard to beat, I don’t mean that as a bad thing, however it irks me when a single unrevealed card can decide the match. Due to this, the game feels very random to me, that is, the game has it fair share of uncontrollable luck. If we play quickly I don’t mind as much, but if the game begins to drag, the luck begins to bother me much more. 

Bottom line, I want to play again but, more likely, say bye to the villains will fall in the same category of Co-Ops in which you can only win if luck wills it (Pandemic, Flash Point, etc.), furthermore if the decisions are obvious. If this happen, the game rating will plummet as I hate those.

Ezek a keleti játékok mindig nagyon érdekesek, különlegesek megjelenésben is, meg mechanikában is (akkor is ha amerikai a kiadó :)).
Alapvetően lenyűgöző az egész tervezés, a "jók" és "rosszak" külön paklija, a nagyon egyszerű rendszer, a könnyű, egyszerű akciólehetőségek, a korlátok, a kooperaitivitás... mégis, végeredményben a játékélmény eléggé fájó. Az még hagyján, hogy a kártyák véletlenszerűsége igen aránytalan helyzeteket teremt, de alapvetően is kegyetlenül nehéznek tűnik. Biztosan van lehetőség a fejlődésre, és minden bizonnyal sokkal jobban is lehet csinálni, mint ahogyan mi tettük, de valahogy nem érzem a késztetést, hogy még próbálkozzak vele. Tényleg sajnálom, mert közben meg valóban érezni a zsenialitását...

RATING: 2
A very puzzle-y game with very strict victory conditions. Your group controls X heroes and must defeat X villains in X one-on-one combats. Any loss or tie in any of those combats and you collectively lose. Meanwhile, virtually everything about who the villains are and what stats or special powers they have is hidden at the start of the game, and you must use your limited time/resources to discover what you can and guess about the rest.

Once you're out of time, flip over the rest of the cards and see if you solved the puzzle. It's like Galaxy Trucker where the meat of the game is in the first half, except that literally all of the game is in the first half, and there's not even the entertainment value of watching somebody else's ship get blown apart.

Really enjoyed our test play; some of the card text can be confusing but easily solved with crib sheet.

The game artwork style suits this type of game and in the end is a great co-op.

The mechanisims in this game work very well together and it seems to be balance however some heroes and villains are clearly over/underpowered based in their special habilities.

Charming coop game with nice Japanese artwork. Theme of preparing and fighting against bad guys comes through very well. (Almost all activities, like training, cost time. When exploring hidden support of bad guys can find false leads and traps but also collaborators.) Seems extremely difficult when limiting communication because some of the hidden properties of bad guys can flip around the goal or require a surprisingly large value in one of the three attributes.

Neat little cooperative game that feels like a bite size version of Shadowrun Crossfire or Sentinels of the Multiverse. The game is extremely difficult though. Almost to the point of being unfair. At the same time though, these kinds of co-ops are the ones I enjoy most nowadays. Even though this game can be extremely random, it's an interesting hand management puzzle. You have to balance out buffing up your character, getting intel on your enemies, and making sure your fellow players are prepared for their final battles. So yes, things aren't always going to go your way, but that's what keeps me coming back for more from this game. Tons of variety, tons of fun, and supports a large amount of players without adding much time.

RATING: 6.5
An infuriating co-op so comically hard to win and lacking in fun factor that it conjures up memories of playing Ninja Gaiden in the 80s, dying over and over in the same way.
----
I'll walk that last comment back after a second play -- nothing is as bad as Ninja Gaiden -- and add that although it supports 8, the game becomes exponentially more difficult as numbers increase. It's still comical to have a card granting +99 life to a villain. While a win seems, after 2 plays, to essentially depend on luck of the draw, the point of the proceedings is the discussion between the players as we settle on the right deployment strategy based on imperfect information. Ultimately, win/not win seems relatively unimportant, being arbitrary (e.g., were the unexamined cards comprised of the 5% that actually work out in our favor). Also, there is some delight in showing off the sheer ludicrousness to players unfamiliar. Upping rating from 5.

A short and difficult to win co-operative card game. 

The original box cover data of '4 to 6 players recommended' and '30 to 60 minutes' is more descriptive than AEG´s '3-8 players' and '45 minutes'. I'd say this takes less than ten minutes per player, and with three players the playing time is twenty minutes at most.

RATING: 8
"Clever game, but I have serious concerns about it."

What I like:
- Unusual mechanisms, especially for a co-op
- You really do need to cooperate, but it's not play by commitee
- I enjoyed it, but can't think of specifically why

What I don't like:
- Building up for one all-or-nothing battle
- An unrevealed card could cause a sudden, unpreventable loss at the end of a 60-minute game
- Communication restrictions are a bit vague
- I'm not a big fan of communication restrictions in general 

The "prepare and then battle" sequence reminds me a bit of Galaxy Trucker (which I dislike). Losing to a nasty unrevealed card would really suck. Our (surprisingly) easy win took 40 minutes.

Learning the rules is a bit confusing at first, but once you understand it it plays smoothly. It can feel like a bit of a brainburner at times.

I would put the weight around 2.4, just a bit below the BGG-voted weight of 2.5.

Rating of 8 is conditional. Could fall to 7 if it feels too luck-driven with more plays.

There aren't enough bad guys or good guys. Other than that, my group had a lot of fun with this one.

Things went much better the second game. Really fun time.

This is a cooperative game that is really challenging as it is far from easy to win from all the villains, and that is exactly the requirement for winning the game.
In the game you are all heroes and you are preparing for a one on one fight, each with one villain. Only time and attributes are limited. So you have to help other players and communicate about the needs and possibilities.
This is a nice game with great artwork at the cards. The convening that comes with this game is great.

A fun and challenging co-operative game. Not only is it by the creator of Love Letter and features amazing art, this game really gets the team going. Different vanquishers and villains to choose from, OR what we did, 'randomize'.
With a nifty 'time' system, this game will make you think deeply before you take action.

There's a lot to like here. Good variety between all of the different villains, vanquishers, and the different cards in each deck. The limits on information sharing help keep the game from becoming too puzzle-y the way a lot of co-op games can be. And it plays in about 45 minutes or less.

On the downside, the game seems like it might be way too difficult. You can play your best and plan everything perfectly, but one unchecked villain card can make you lose the whole game. The winning conditions are also a little disappointing. You lose the game if you don't defeat all of the villains or if any one of the vanquishers dies. This means that sometimes you know you've lost the game before the final turn because one player just wasn't able to power up enough to beat one of the villains.

Overall, a fun, unique co-op, even if it's too unforgiving.

The experience driven by it's particular aesthetic - incredible art & pop culture references - as much as by the mechanics. Just a pleasure on the table & a lively casual entertainment.

It carries buckets of that Kanai charm spread across a large deck of gorgeous cards. In the long run, for Kanai lovers only.

Interesting game that I would certainly like to try again, but I am not a big fan of co-op games in general, and this one still requires too much guessing after the players played all the cards they could. Also, I am not sure about the cards that have a negative effect when you turn them over - makes the game unnecessary random in my opinion.

A Kanai card game with lots of Kanai features. Since I really enjoy his previous designs, this one is no exception. This game share many similarities to his other creation, Cheaty Mages in terms of card play mechanics, but with a different objective. Instead of a competitive experience in Cheaty Mages, SBTV is a cooperative design. 

Each player assumes the role of a villager about to do battle with a bunch of evil villains. The number of villains assaulting the village matches the number of players. Working together, players play cards in their hands to prepare for the upcoming battle. Each action spent or card played consumes time and every player has 10 time units (or days) to spend in preparation. The coolest feature of the game is that the villains also get to prepare for the battle. A certain number of event cards are played face down on each villain. These event cards symbolize the "yet unknown" preparation carried out by each baddie. These events range from hiring extra bodyguards, setting up ambushes for the fight or even a change of heart (due to an ailing wife!). 

Now, players play cards to either boost individual attributes (speed, power or life) or help identify and/or eliminate the event cards on each villain. Collectively there are probably more cards on the villains than there are time units to spend. So, most of the cooperative negotiation between players will come from discussing how to best spend time units to eliminate event cards or to boost individual attributes.

Once all time units are consumed or cards are exhausted, players then reveal the remaining event cards and do a one-on-one battle based on the personal attributes. Final and total victory can only be achieved if all villains are eliminated and all villagers survive. Partial victory goes to mutual sacrifice of villagers with the villains while survival of even a single villain is considered a loss. Quite a challenging goal.

I love the mechanics of the game. The hidden cards represent an obstacle that must be collectively surmounted in order to win. Since not all cards can be revealed, there is a certain amount of luck and variability in the outcome that cannot be controlled. This will irk some gamers that desire total and complete information. Part of the elegance of this game is to figure out which villain represents the highest threat and to properly assign villagers to tackle each threat. Failure to do so or to catch a break will result in a loss. Indeed, the theme is superbly integrated with the mechanics of this game. Think about it: it is impossible to always gauge every single move that a villain makes. One has to catch a break now and then to beat a baddie.

Thumbs up for Kanai's unique homage to Kurosawa's Seven Samurai.

Bought January 2015

Positive - 

- Great art / theme

- High potential player count

- Fast play time (the play time listed on the box is certainly an exaggeration, at least with four or fewer players.)

- The strict split between building up / final showdown is an interesting mechanic and gives it a different feel from other co-ops, but...

Negative - 

- ... it also makes the game feel very random at times. 

- Some characters have painfully obvious combos (ie Rin / Tatsu)

I like this game, but it is a hard game with only a couple people. It seems to get more strategic as you add players. 

Some people I've played with don't get the team aspect, they just use up their time, maximizing their character and have a go at it, missing the information gathering and the team planning, where everyone discusses you help me get strength and I help you get life. The who can best deal with who aspect and what they need to do it IS the game. 

So it's not for all groups. I know some groups I would not want to play it with. And a few people who make this a really great fun.

My general advice before grading it, try collectively information gather in the early game and plan the rest of the game, talking about the plan as you go.

Ok, co-op puzzle game to defeat a bunch of random cards. Vastly better than the awful Sentinels Of The Multiverse, but not particularly interesting.

RATING: 7
Despite what the battle-the-villains theme would make you think, the game is actually very analytical and mathematical once the capabilities of the villains are discovered and plans begin to be set in motion. Nevertheless, it's a good totally cooperative game which manages to accomodate with little effort 3 to 8 players.

I can't give this a fair analysis yet, because I've only played with open hands, which removes a lot of the challenge from the game. I think the idea of the game is interesting, and I like the small size of the box because it's easy to transport, but it involves a touch too much math/computing of stats for my taste.

Excellent coop game! recommended with 4 or more players because there are more cards for the players to strategize. With 3 players sometimes the villain becomes too overpower and the hero have no chances to remove enough cards. Still an awesome coop game that is worth the try even in the face of certain defeat. :D

While the theme and main mechanic is compelling, the information sharing mechanic is quite irking. Perhaps the checking but not revealing part can be removed totally from the game. Replayability may also be low. Artwork is nice.

This is a great cooperative game in a small package. I enjoy the theme a lot, and find that it's easy to explain every card play, and reveal effect in story terms, which is the way it should be.

A 3-player game with a lot of deliberation still clocks in at 40 minutes, and is thrilling till the last Situation Card's turned up. I really like this game a ton!

RATING: 7
1 game comments (4p). Ran a lot longer than stated and felt like Dead of Winter with more optimisation, because of the full coop rather than personal missions/possible traitor. Felt very hard too, which drove the optimisation discussions. Maybe 4p are too many. 3 or even 2. But I came away wanting to play again.

A rules light eurogame heavy on the apocalyptic theme. Plays solitaire without special rules. It has some nice ideas like the hero/survivor team, the truck and the polaroids. Atmosphere is dense and tense. Good game.

Nice components, nice Settings, clever idea with hero and survivor. With the additional Tasks and different Locations and Team members it is each time a different game. And sure, sometimes it can be tough...but who likes easy cooparative games.

RATING: 6.5
Good cooperative game but it is very punishing and tight, which bring some tension to the game, but also so stress.  So I am glad the game is short enough that the stress isn't overbearing and the feeling of scrapping things together in order to make it to safety is very thematic, but takes a bit away from the game.

2016  2nd impressions (after 3 sessions and 6 total games, all solo) Really getting to enjoy this game, that is about the length and complexity of Pandemic but that I find is a much more interesting (and thematic) puzzle to solve. Salvation Road has a great visual look, with locations and characters represented by old Polariod style pictures.  The game has interesting and well developed characters, and feels like it should be the next Richard Launius cooperative action game.  Instead, the game is more of a resource maximization puzzle, with the pain but not the glamour of fighting the bad guys.  The game has several clever mechanisms (hero/survivor, wound tokens, and the path to Salvation) and requires finding the synergy between survivors and locations to find the most resources and give yourself the best chance to reach Salvation.

Great components.  Sometimes seems unwinnable with only 2 actions per character and a heavy dose of randomness.  Very brutal with a wonderful theme that really shines through.

Only two plays in so far, both losses, but I really enjoyed both. The resource management is done very well and this is a tight game. The hero / survivor mechanic is novel and it is well implemented. I look forward to future solo plays.

I think I'll take Dead of Winter in the similar vein, but this had plenty to like! The two character dynamic was fun and made for interesting strategic works and I enjoyed the risks of going with lower resources. The resources felt constrained, which was a great feel for the situation. It was a little subject to alpha player syndrome.

This game is very thematic and can be brutal on certain occasions if luck is not on your side.  There is lot of replayability with all the different characters and locations that come in the box.  

It's a very well produced and fun game from Van Ryder Games!

An incredible game of theme, characterisation and several different gameplay mechanics. Pretty much played all my games multi-handed solo... and still love it. It's really hard to win, but I still love it. Great, great game.

This game is part Robinson Crusoe and part Dead of Winter.  There are a couple of cool parts: (1) your heroes rock... and your survivors are such a drag and (2) you gather resources not necessarily knowing what you'll need for the road ahead.

My wife and I like and play a lot of coops.  We especially like it when we lose the first few games, get better, and have to develop better strategies.  This game has done that so far.

As a side note, the components are excellent and well thought-out.  An A on the general scale and an A+++ on the Kickstarter scale.

Nice work Van Ryder Games!

Nice little Solo experience that feels like a slimmed down Richard Launius adventure game.  Seriously, Richard is a "ghost writer" on this game, right?  The Polaroid style location cards are a truly ingenious idea and look awesome on the table.  The estimated time of 45 to 75 minutes seems pretty spot on too.

Very heavy on theme.  It is a very challenging game.  So far, I haven't come close to winning.  I've got to try some new strategies.  The great part is I'm looking forward to playing it again so I can try a few new ideas.

[1 play] The deck is definitely stacked against you in Salvation Road. I enjoyed the experience and will happily play it again if it comes up. A very decent co-op with nice artwork and good theme. Walking Dead style, gather enough supplies while guarding your encampment, then when you think you have enough or the marauders are about to storm the fence, make a dash down the road to the town of "Salvation".

Most recent play Oct '16.

After two solo plays and two 2P plays, I like it.  I really do.  There's a lot to like here and the Hero/Survivor element + Random Locations element promise a large serving of replay-ability.  Each of my 4 sessions certainly provided a very unique range of challenges and opportunities.

But... I can't escape an icky feeling that a certain percentage of sessions might just be un-beatable from the get-go.  The variety of factors that provide the replay-ability also seem to contribute to a random chance that you are just completely screwed, but you won't find out until you've committed an hour of your time. 

Based on that, I totally agree with community feeling that this game is best with 2 players, in fact it might even be best with 1.  I think that as a solitaire activity it's pretty darned fun and I can bang through a session solo in 30 minutes easy.  

There are also a lot of very promising variant rules in the back of the rulebook which could be experimented with to tweak the game to your personal tolerance of difficulty/randomness.  If you like Post-Apocalypse themes, Co-op games and are willing to experiment with variant rules, this is close to a Must Own.  If any of those don't thrill you, it trickles down to a pretty low-end 'Meh'.

Finally got the game to the game table today, and everyone around the table enjoyed it very much. We lost but played one more game directly, and lost even more! But it will come to our table again soon. Really good game.

Salvation Road's emphasis on a puzzling survival situation makes this a pretty good solo game, but with more players it never really survives the inevitable comparison to Dead of Winter.

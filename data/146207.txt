GAME: Dead Man's Hand
RANK: 4843

RATING: 8
Dead Mans Hand rules set is easy to pick up and pretty cheap – The miniatures do not need to be Great Escapes Games versions, there are loads of wild west minis out there. I love the Black Scorpions Tomestone minis.

Where I feel you need to spend the cash is scenery – The town you play the scenes in is a massive part of the game – I don’t have much yet and it takes away from the experience not having it. 
The actual gun fights and narrative behind them are fantastic – you really feel like you are in a western, bullets flying everywhere! It plays quickly with no down time. 
Highly recommended – Just set the scene!

What an easy and fun set of rules.

Played this at the gaming club and all agreed it was really good.

Cards for turn order and in the hand make this such a fun game. Really captures the essence of the Hollywood cowboy films.

These rules are unbelievably simple and are great to play. I have bought two copies so I can play with more gangs and have three and four-player games instead of just two-player ones. They are fantastic and combine a great shoot-out with some role-playing. Just right for big kids. I highly recommend them

Two copies allows you much more freedom in formulating the gangs. You can even have a free-for-all with four gangs on the table and include a bit of back-stabbing.

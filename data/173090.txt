RATING: 5
Initially I thought about rating this a four or a three because usually you had very few options on your turn and your choices were obvious. But then I surprised myself and ended up giving a five despite the lack of decision making. This is because we actually laughed quite a bit during the game and I did not have any thoughts about wanting to end the game prematurely. I guess, I was excited at some perverse level to see whether the cards had been shuffled so that we can win the game. The bottom line is that there is nothing broken nor the game is particularly annoying. Playing time just right for a co-operative 6nimmt, i.e., 15-20 minutes.

You will like this game:
- if you don't like to have fun during game
- if you like coop game where you cannot cooperate
- if you like games that are determine by the draw of cards (ok sometimes, every 35th play there is a good play to do)
- if you like games that are uninteresting for the 90% first part and only interesting at the end
- if the only other game in your collection is monopoly
- if you believe the label "spiel des jahres" make it a good game

.. seriously don't buy this game, it's boring and there are so many better games out there.

A little reminiscent of Hanabi; but it feels most like a deeper, cooperative version of Rack-O. Having said that, the game actually works, in spite of being a somewhat dry puzzle.

RATING: 6
A cooperative version of the game 99 (down to the -10 for playing a 10).
This would be better with some extra clues on the cards to indicate the  +/-10 effect.
I know the rule, it's just that vigilance to always figure out if each of your cards is 10 more or ten less than this pile or this one takes away a bit from the other analytical thinking needed to play the game.
Finally Coop games that forbid me from talking removes much of the point of playing a coop game at all. Iknow a lot of these kinds of rules are to cut down on alpha-gamers, but seriously, just find new people to play games with!

The Game reminded me of the traditional card game Eights (aka Switch).  Cards are played to columns and either ascending or descending order must be maintained.  The object is to get through as much of the deck as possible as opposed to getting rid of your hand, for The Game is cooperative.  As others have commented, it doesn't feel very cooperative while you play - the limit of cooperation seems to be asking another player not to add cards to a certain column.  Once you get the idea that playing exactly ten higher or lower is good and that leaving gaping gaps in the sequence of cards is bad, there really isn't very much to think about.  I'd rather play Eights.

RATING: 8.5
A really fun and interesting co-op in which you're laying out piles of descending and ascending numbers, able to 'reverse' if you lay one that is exactly 10 higher or lower than the previously played card. The challenge is to read your teammates without revealing any actual card numbers, and to clear out as much of your hands and the draw deck as possible. For those who like Hanabi, this is mildly less brain burning, but I personally enjoy it more.

UPDATE: After about half a dozen plays, I can safely say this is indeed addictive and no wonder it was up for an SdJ.

RATING: 3
Perhaps I am dense, but there really isn't much to think about with this game. The entire game centers around recognizing opportunities to place cards efficiency and/or move backwards. The catch is you can't give out specific numeric information... but it's not much of a catch as you would rarely want to. Really, the entire game consists of "oh... don't touch that pile... I like it."

In sum, if you can recognize increments of 10 and can count backwards... there is nothing cerebral about this game. More of an activity than anything else.

We have fun with two people and we have a lot of fun with five people. We even played with six and it still worked out alright. To be fair, we probably aren't playing 100% by the rules as we can say things like "I like this row", "I love this row", "This row and I are going to run off and elope and make lots of babie." We still have only gotten to 10 cards once in numerous times playing, so its not like we are making it super easy by saying more things.

The game is a pleasant co-op filler, and for its price (little more than 10€) is a true bargain!

Players try to play all their 98 cards in four piles (two ascending piles from 1 up, and two descending piles from 100 down). Each players must play 2+ cards on his/her turn, then refill the hand.
The twist is that cards that are the of a value of exactly 10 more/less than the topmost card on a pile can be played disregarding the correct ascending/descending order.

There is no wow factor or any innovative breakthrough, but The Game surprised me anyway: a little gem, playable even with non-gamers...

I have only played this on the app solo and played that way I find the game addictive. I've already played dozens of times but as far as an actual "game" goes it's really quite simple. The reason I find it addictive is because it's somewhat mindless. There are decisions to be made but often decisions are pretty obvious. There is also A LOT of luck. The app version has also killed the real version in that I already know I just wouldn't want to play this in person.

I'm generally a fan of any game that is cooperative, and the simplicity of this one makes it a big draw for me. I'm not sure why these "beat your best score" games don't bother me more, but I think it's the fact that you always feel like there's a chance that any time you could hit that perfect game, so it's worth always trying to do better. My first time playing we used an accidental variant that made it a little easier, so I can see where this game would be stressful when played the right way. But that kind of stress, which comes from tension over making the right choice to benefit your team, is what makes cooperative games enjoyable. I definitely need to pick up a copy of the Game, but could they publish a version with an actual name/theme pasted on it? That's my only real complaint.

--------------------------------------------------------
Quick Rules:
The Game is simple. The goal of The Game is to play all the cards from the deck and all of your hands. You and your "friends" have four piles to play your cards in, two going up starting from 1 to 99, two going down starting at 100 to 2. On your turn, play at least two cards from your had onto the pile/piles of your choosing. This game is fully cooperative so feel free to talk, but you can never reveal exactly what's in your hand. At the end of your turn draw back up to your hand limit and play continues to the next person. If at any time someone cannot play two cards the game is over and count up the remaining cards to get your score. The rules book points out that this game is difficult and any number under 10 is a great play.
--------------------------------------------------------
Everyone I played with loved this game, it was simple, fast, easy to learn. The problem with that was I was the only one that owned it originally and meant I played this game a lot. I enjoyed it, but the more we played we kinda developed a system that went from within the legal limit of chatter to an area that might not be within the actual rules. To balance it out we play 3 cards per turn. The trouble with removing the chatter from the game, kinda makes the game less awesome. It means that it's random luck in what we draw, then hope everyone plays in the right order. So, while I'm fairly sure we are cheating, I'm okay with the cheating because it is kinda making the fun. Singing "People let me tell you about my best friend" when asked "Are you really close to this pile?" pretty much tells everyone what I have in my hand, but is fun and dare I say hilarious. We do play most game with three required plays per turn so that kinda cancels out the partial cheating.

The main problem with this game, other then our play groups rampant cheating... which we are okay with now, is on occasion you'll run into a slow player. Someone who just looks at their cards for minutes. It's like they are staring blankly into an alternate universe, where simple mathematics is not actually a thing, and when they come back they appear to play their cards at random. This is easily managed by just not playing with those people again. I'm assuming this isn't the only game they are doing this in... perhaps you can use this short game to weed out impending doom before you commit to a two-three hour game with them.*

If you are reading this and are on the fence about this game, get it(try to get a new copy that comes with the On Fire cards in it. More info on their comments on BGG.) It's fun, just flat out fun. I even enjoy playing solo. Very rarely, if ever, is it only played one time once brought to the table. Also, it's insanely comical to yell at new players "DO YOU HATE US!" or "YOU ARE THE WORST AT THIS GAME!" the first time they have to jump a pile up double digits. Let's be real, it's fun to yell that stuff at experienced players when the Game is going poorly for your team. And lastly, maybe the best thing of all, you and your friends will get to make up your own songs to sing to tell people how important each pile is to you. 

*Just a personal gripe- During a game we had a guy wait a full two minutes before playing a card, finally saying "It's my only play!" Then when I pointed out playing the same card in a different pile would only hurt us four points instead of 17 he fired back "Fine, I'll do whatever to stop Dana's bitching." which is odd to have someone say in a cooperative game. (Same guy from Mafia de Cuba, Spyfall and This Town Ain't Big Enough.)

I’ve played The Game with three completely different groups so far and still have been unimpressed by it: it feels like Hanabi for Dummies, which means it’s dull, unexciting and way too long.

I find no fun in cooperative games that forbid players from talking about the communal strategy: what’s worse, you don’t even feel like talking at all during The Game, as your brain gets overloaded in the futile attempt at coming up with the best way to «optimize» (undoubtedly the worst word in gaming) the cards in your hand without giving up too much.

All of this feels like working, which is too much for me: when I play a game I want to have fun, not to feel like I’m up to a chore.

Clever use of cards from 2 - 99, however if it wasn't for Spiel nomination, I would of never given this a look.  It actually is pretty addicting.  You wouldn't think you have a ton of choices, but hand management aspect of this one is pretty interesting.  I can see why this was nominated, and it definitely fits in with Hanabi & Qwixx nominations of the past

Playing with an 11 Nimmt deck while I wait hopefully for an English version.

They really picked an amazing theme, and it ties into the gaming experience so well. While I play, I really feel like I am playing a game.

The first two or three plays were... unpleasant. I felt like I was playing the rules but it was an activity, not a game. Like Patience I suppose. But after a couple of plays, and with other players say who are into it, it's actually pretty good!

Funny that I said above, "like Patience". This is almost literally multiplayer solitaire. Not in the sense that there's no player interaction — there really is, and you'll lose horribly if you don't coordinate — but it feels like multiplayer Patience. Picture playing Klondike solitaire, but instead of a single open three-card hand, every player has their own, and you're not allowed to say you have a 6 but you can say you can deal with this and that column on your turn. That'll give you an idea.

Rating high, 8, mostly because my wife and son have played this [i]when I'm not around[/i]. THIS NEVER HAPPENS.

People compare it to Hanabi, because it's also a light co-op card game. I will warn gamers who already play and enjoy Hanabi, this may seem like a step backwards. It may be the lightest co-op game I've come across. If you still play and like Hanabi, I don't know you're going to get much more from this game. It's different, but doesn't add to the genre, if that makes sense. (And I say this even though I like this game and dislike Hanabi.)

Tip for play: If you approach the cooperation as you would with Hanabi, the game will fail and you will be left disappointed. With the right amount of communication (picture what you'd say in Shadows Over Camelot: general planning but no specific numbers), it actually works really well.

Spiel des Jahres? I do think it's worthy. It'd probably be my pick, if Hanabi didn't win two years earlier. Hanabi is almost like a more advanced version of this, so some people who buy and play this might go, "Why aren't we just playing Hanabi?" (I am not one of those people, but I think others may think this.)

Don't play solo.

A nice and simple co-op. The difficulty depends very much on the distribution and order of the cards. There's not much possibility for clever play (but many opportunities to overlook obvious plays).

RATING: 6
A very simple cooperative game of playing cards to piles following some simple rules. However, with these simple rules is quite a bit of tension as you worry about if/when you'll be able to play your cards.

The only kind of odd thing is the while deal about being able to communicate with other players, but you can't tell them what you have. Any group can quickly develop their own lingo to communicate exactly what cards they have, so it always feels a little silly, although the game becomes very dumb if people know exactly what you have.

Overall, an OK activity for when you just want to play something quick and easy.

Solitaire play only. Random, luck dependent, and overly frustrating. There's no strategy other than hoping you draw a card that can reset a stack by 10. As many others have said, the artwork and scary theme are a really weird choice and the name is ridiculously pretentious.

I got this game because it was a Spiel des Jahres winner. I also thought it might be easier to teach than Hanabi. 

Actualol also recommended this game.

RATING: 6
This games greatest flaw is that it lives in a world where Hanabi exists. They are both short coöps for the same player count. And one of them is pure genius, and the other is okay.

This isn't a bad game. It's a bit tricky to impart the information you need to impart, because you don't want to give away the exact cards you are holding (so the trickiness is self-imposed), but the play itself isn't all that exciting, and it feels like what you draw is more important than how you play.

ANY game I play 20 times in the first 10 days after acquiring it (and 36 times in 6 weeks) is an excellent – and, as you can tell, addictive – game! So why don’t I rate it any higher? Well, because there isn’t that much to the game; it’s cosy and enjoyable, but it’s not revolutionary and I don’t want to play it all the time. When I read about it was flabbergasted that it was nominated for the SdJ, but it’s actually the game I enjoy the most of the nominees, and it’s even been a big hit with my not-so-fond-of-playing-boardgames younger siblings, so there you have it.

It’s a coop which reminds me a bit of Hanabi, although this game is much, much easier to play and to win. You have a deck of cards numbered from 2-99, and you have 6-7 cards on your hand depending on the number of players. You then must play at least two cards onto any of the four piles (two ascending, two descending piles). So if I, for instance, play a 4 and then a 7, you must play at least an 8, or use any of the other piles. In the beginning, it’s not too difficult, but it will soon be… Oh, and the catch is that you cannot say which numbers you have! You can only give vague clues and state how much you would like to play a card on that specific pile etc… That is where all the fun and tension comes in. As you might be wondering, it would be almost impossible to win just by playing higher or lower cards – so this is handled by a genius rule: you can always play a card exactly 10 higher/lower on a descending/ascending pile! So, if there is e.g. a 56 on a pile which is descending, I can play a 55 and lower, OR I can play a 66 (and even a 76 on top of that 66 etc.). This means you can make some very clever moves and save yourself from doom; when it seems that it’s impossible to win, you might make some of those jumps and suddenly everything is going to be alright…

What I love is when people are acting crazy when they *need* that and that pile. As said, you’re not allowed to say which cards you have, so we just say something like “I really really really need to play on that pile” or “I LOVE that pile, it’s mine, don’t touch it!” or “please only make a tiny jump here” etc. Or the vague “I can probably only play on this pile, but it’s going to be a jump, perhaps slightly more”; what exactly is a “jump” or a “small jump” etc? The meta gaming is actually quite interesting. This also means that The Game is quite a different beast than Hanabi – a game in which you have to communicate a lot by small means (the clue tokens). Also, I would say that Hanabi oozes theme compared to this one… I’m not really sure what the theme is here.

The rules state that you win the game if you have played all of the cards, but that you have also done very well if you have less than 10 cards left in your hands; to date, I’ve only had more than 10 cards left once, and that was in my second game when we were just figuring things out. I’ve won more than half of my games, so I think it might be a little too easy to win outright (unlike Hanabi in which you only *really* win if you get 25 points, which I’ve only done in 5 out of 94 plays…) So, I think the game is a little too easy – there are variants if you think it’s too easy, but I’ve actually also won one of two plays when we played with the advanced hard rules that state that you must play at least 3 cards each turn! 
And this emphasizes one of the drawbacks: the luck of the draw. Simply put, you’re never going to win if the cards keep coming in a horrible order; and yes, I’ve experienced that multiple times. It just felt that there was nothing we could do about it, and it wasn’t because we played poorly. That does reduce a bit of my enjoyment of the game. The same could be said about the end game: the whole game is relaxing fun, but during the end game, you actually have to discuss quite a bit about who is playing how many cards in which order – just because you can play all of your cards don’t mean that you have to, as it might mean that one of the other players suddenly can’t play (this is true through the entire game, but especially during end-game).

I think I prefer it at the lower player counts as you have more control and the communication is easier to handle – but I do enjoy it at any player count. One last thing: it is easily played with a deck consisting of the cards 2-99, so I find it a little odd that I paid €10 for this, when I can get e.g. 6 Nimmt for €7 and get two games in one… Oh well, I guess I paid for the idea, and the idea is really good!

Has a few similarities to Hanabi. I found the game to be ok, rather simple game play with lots of card counting. The replay value is probably not too good so it won't be something I pick up, but I'd prefer Hanabi for this genre.

The  Game is an entertaining exercise in card counting and logics. Good for solo as with a group.
The artwork is weard though. There's skulls everywhere and the foreheads look as if they where riddled with bullets. Unnessesary creepy for a game that could be all age.
After awhile of playing I found myself with the urge to switch solitaire games and ended up playing "If I'm going down".

Great little coop. Easy to teach and play, and get done in half an hour. Noisy and exhilarating, with players trying to find a way to signal each other without cheating. We found it a bit easy to win, so I wonder how much replayability it has. Less classy than Hanabi, but still a very good game that deserves its nomination for SdJ 2015. Certainly at its best with families with young children learning to count, or with non-gamers. Keeper.

The rules for this (poorly named) card game were so simple I thought it wouldn't be very much fun. A simple ladder game that's cooperative - where's the fun in that?

I was wrong. Dead wrong. This is fiendishly clever and I now completely understand the SdJ nomination. Players are trying to manage 4 rows of cards while being unable to communicate exactly what they have in their hands. Playing more cards is good so you can get fresh cards, but play too much and you could breeze past that perfect card your buddy was holding.

So far we've done very well, and I appreciate that the rules include two ways to increase the difficulty if you feel like you've beaten The Game. This would make a great stocking stuffer or add-on for any gamer household.

[b]What I like:[/b] An awesome cooperative game that has some of the worst graphic design I have ever seen (see notes).  I love the way it forces you to come up with ways to talk about your hand without talking specifics.

[b]What I dislike:[/b] beating the dead horse here - the graphic design is BAD.  It turns off family play, and is hard to confirm which way is up on the card sometimes.

[b]Colour Blindness:[/b] Its just numbers, so no.

It's one of those cooperatives with really vague, open-ended "rules" that limit communication. Those types of guidelines never really work that well. The game? That's such a cliche name: it's like just talking about "life" as an undefined concept. And the art doesn't help that absurdity. It isn't amazing. It is rarely intense. BUT *mid-review turnaround* sometimes it just does enough to work and pass the time in such a way that you'll find yourself coming back and repeating it. It's a cooperative filler that just *works* -- and works with non-gamers.

It's too simple and leaves too much luck left as a factor for winning. The artwork on the card doesn't really strike me as interesting either. I guess it's trying to play off the feeling in "Saw" when combined with the subtitle but in no way did I feel any emotional connection or that my life was in danger. 

[11 Feb 2018] - 5 (2 plays)
Bumped this up to a 5 because it's actually an average game in line with something like solitaire. Decisions about which cards to play and where they might be useful come down to you but you can take a bit of feedback from other players in the game. It's a quick 15 min filler that can be used to wrap up a game day or start one off.

A very simple cooperative game, almost akin to one of the traditional Patience card games.  Players work together to dispatch a deck of 98 cards out onto four common piles of cards.  Two piles run in ascending order from 1, and the other two in descending order from 99.  Two cards have to be played on each player's turn, but the ascending/descending order can be reversed if you can play a card that is +/- 10.  A fast, fun exercise as you puzzle out the situation.  Liked it.

Cooperative version of solitaire. Play all cards from 2-99 across four piles. Two piles must have ascending, two must have descending. There's a small rule to remember where a card can break the asc/descending order if it is exactly 10 numbers away from the top card in a pile. Sounds simple enough, but because players cannot openly communicate the exact cards in their hands, it's a tense cooperative exercise.

15-20m, 2-4 players. 5+ plays.

I tried this one with a 6 Nimmt deck and a printed mat for the piles. It worked fine but I didn't overly enjoy the gameplay. It felt like you had very little control over what was going on. I played it with 2 players. Maybe it would feel different with various player counts. Maybe it wouldn't seem so random with multiple plays, but honestly, it was felt so dull to me that I don't have any interest in gaining proficiency in it. It's not a bad or terrible design, it's just something I found to be boring.

Mix of Qwixx, Solitaire, and Onirim. I 'guess' I could see playing this if I somehow needed a slightly different way to play solitaire, but seriously, who does? I'm not sure why this is a multi-player game, each person simply makes fairly obvious decisions on their turn and players just collectively wait to see if they draw a good or bad hand. It is just dumb.

The only thing missing is the cards don't bounce across the screen leaving trails if you win.

1-4 player card game in which you have 4 base cards which you build on. One stack has a base card starting at 1 and goes up and the last card ending in 100. The other 2 base cards go from 100 down to 1. The object is to place that cards in your hand that either go up or down which are numbered from 2-99 on the appropriate stack. The object is to try and eliminate all of the cards, finishing with 0 cards in the deck. The catch? You can't tell what card you are holding to others.

Credit where credit is due, The Game is simply addictive because you want to beat it, and every game it feels like you are learning something new that will get you a little closer to victory.

I can tell you this, whatever the algorithm to beating The Game is, the cards at intervals of 10 are a strong and powerful element to the solution.

My one nit-pick with the game is that this is a game where you are putting cards in ascending or descending order, to play it again you have to get the cards back out of order which can take a while.

The Game will have strong appeal to anyone who likes their solitaire card games like Freecell or Solitaire, or enjoys mathematical puzzles.

Not sure what to make of this one, I had never even heard of it until the spiel nomination and then when the rules were explained to me I ridiculed them, after all there really is no game here at all is there?.......

Having played it however it is a really simple interesting diversion and actually i had a good time playing it... The art work choice (skull with what looks like a gunshot in the forehead) is an interesting choice however the numbers on each card are clear enough and that makes the game perfectly playable.

I really don't understand its spiel nomination, and the name is just terrible... go on try a search engine to find the damnable thing! but if you can find it for a good price (sub £5) then grab a copy because why not?
I doubt I will suggest a game however if others want an extra player I will not say no

[b]Essentially a variation on [i]Dutch Blitz/Ligretto[/i] - but now it is co-op and turn-based.[/b]

This isn't the kind of game to set the world on fire, but for a simple, small-box card game, it does something fresh, which is nice. It's a fair challenge in a 10 minute package, which makes it attractive as filler. Bonus: Can be played with a 6 Nimmt deck in a pinch.

Simple, yet very interesting filler card game. In the five or so times I have played, we never won, but got close a couple of times. It is luck dependent and always deceptively makes you think you can win... which I am sure you can.

I wonder if they meant to recreate Hanabi for those who found Hanabi too confusing, not knowing your own hand and all that. Of course, that was exactly what made Hanabi special... The Game is a simple cooperative card game where players try to get rid of their cards by playing to a couple of discard piles according to certain restrictions. If it works out you win.

Many cooperative games are more or less thinly disguised number puzzles. The Game forgoes the disguise entirely. It's a number puzzle front, left, and centre. With nothing else to keep you attracted to the game the initial interest is going to wane quickly. There are a couple of variant rules to increase the difficulty but none of them change the game in a way to create a different experience. It all feels samey rather quickly.

The game is just a pack of cards numbered from 2 to 99.  You have four piles on which to play cards (2 ascending, 2 descending).  The rule twist is that if you play a card of exactly 10 difference, you can go in the opposite direction.  A nice simply abstract game that plays well solo.  The difficult thing with more than one is that is suffers that horrible co-op thing about you cant reveal the actual cards you hold, but you can talk around it.  You just know you will feel you break this rule at some point and feel bad about it.  Still, a nice solo diversion if you're short on time and need to think just a little (rating 7.582, Jan 2016). UPDATE: Actually, after a few more hands, my feeling is that I would not bring this out as a multi-player game, as the communication contraints never makes a co-op game that much fun.  As a solo thing, I rank it with that feeling you get playing solaire /  klondike.  Its better than this card game, but its essentially a diverting abstraction exercise that can be an amusing diversion.  Rerank to 6.747, Jan 2016) UPDATE: This game went quickly stale (maybe that it was solved) so gone (Rating 5.242, Jan 17)

As a solitaire game, I don't care for "The Game." It feels too frustrating to me because I never have the right cards in my hand. I couldn't get my husband to try it. I'm not wild about the cards. They have a nice finish, and the numbers are big enough for me to see without my glasses. However, they are too stiff for easy shuffling, and the background graphic is creepy (and not in a good way). Also, right out of the shrink wrap, several of the cards were creased. I gave the game to my dad to use for teaching numbers to his ESL class.

Interesting cooperative game which reminds me a bit of Hanabi, in the sense that the players are working together to play their cards in a sequence using very limited communication. The ascending and descending sequences create interesting decisions, and idea to make the numbers go back is very welcome.

The only downside is the grim art direction and theme, No idea why they went with grimdark looking skulls when the game is so abstract and focused on the numbers.

Also, the name of this game is a pain to search for online.

I bought this off of somebody in the BGG.Con flea market and played it with Clifford the same day (in case you haven't figured it out yet Clifford is my buddy who went to BGG.Con with me. He also dedicated his entire convention to helping me get my Magic Number down. Thanks Clifford!) Anyways, although this is a co-op game you really can't alpha game it at all since each player has their own cards and you can't share card values with each other. The rules are simple and the game is challenging. I played this with my parents over Thanksgiving and they liked it as well. I'm 1 for 4 beating the game. Not a bad little card game!

Whew this one is hard to search for on BGG! 

This is a very fun deduction-type cooperative game that accommodates the entire player count. We play mostly 2 players, and it's a game that you get a good bit better at the more you play it. Now, we can consistently beat it with our particular communication conventions. 

The Game fits a specific niche for our group, almost another version of Hanabi. Certain members don't like coops like Pandemic or Ghost Stories as much due to alpha gaming. This is hard to do in The Game. Also, it's ultra-portable, making it a must-include for your bag or bin or what-have-you. Just a simple deck of cards, but very much worth the pickup!

Co-op that has a similar crushing despair theme going for it like The Grizzled, but winning feels more possible. You need to play all 98 cards (numbered 2-99) to win. The trick is near the end of the game, when there are no more cards left to draw, trying still be able to play something each turn.

Simple game where you have a hand of 6 cards and try to lay 2 or more down in ascending &/or descending order (1 to 100).  trick taking element allows you to play a card that is exactly 10 higher/lower to back up the sequence.

If I had to evaluate the game for how it should really be played I would rank it very low, as a co-op game that is played with just the sheer luck of the draw is just not for me. 
Playing with minimal information like: 
"Do you have anything in the range of 5" or "play everything that you have up to a value" has made this game enjoyable for us.

The Game - in spite of its useless, vague name, is a solid co-op game with a simple premise of playing cards to piles in ascending or descending order. The key to the fun in this game is the restriction of not being able to discuss which specific numbers each player has. What often becomes analysis paralysis in co-op games becomes communication paralysis - which is hilarious, as players try to describe numbers and ranges without mentioning specifics. That does mean that this game fails pretty hard as a solo game, but as a true co-op game, this is a simple, fast, solid choice with fun and funny decisions.

Interesting puzzly coop game. You're trying to collectively get all the cards into 4 ladders, 2 ascending  (that start at 1) and 2 descending (that start at 100). You can also play in the "wrong" direction if the card is exactly 10 greater/less. For example, if the top of the ascending pile has a 23, you can play 24 or higher on it, or you can play the 13. You're allowed to talk about your hand to other players in vague terms, to talk them out of playing on a particular pile you want/need to play on. Update: Table talk is extremely important to this game, not only what you want other players to do but what you plan to do. There's sort of a gray area as to what's acceptable table talk; the closer you can get to that gray area, the better you'll do. The real challenge comes when two players aren't close to the number on the pile but they're clearly close to each other. The game may come down to figuring out which of those players should play first.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2016)

I bought The Game solely because it was a 2015 Spiel des Jahres Nominee. For the same reason I didn’t have high hopes as those games are, generally, disliked by me, but I still feel the compulsion to try them at least once (weird, I know :D).

When I read the rules I remember I thought “that’s it”?, in that moment I thought I have made a huge mistake buying it, it seemed too simple to be engaging, but after playing the game I can attest that it is a fun game and, when you finish playing it you want to try it again.

The game components and art are regular, but you don’t need much to play The Game so I think they are adequate as well.

The rules are very easy to explain, you can do it under 3 minutes and the playtime hovers around the 18 minute mark. I prefer it with 3 players but I will play with any configuration but 1 (I’m no solo player).

The Game is a cooperative game in which the communication between players is restricted (otherwise it would be too easy). As the game plays so fast, you can play various games in a row. It has a fair share of luck but I don’t mind because the game is cooperative and plays very fast. It is also a hard and frustrating game but not because it has hard decisions, they are painfully obvious (a minus in my book).

On the other hand, The Game has to have the worst name ever. It was very hard to find in the BGG database. I also find the gameplay to be very simplistic so I feel I will get bored soon (but I could be wrong).

Bottom line, I’m undecided if I should keep it or not. For now I’m leaning toward selling it but I will play it again soon to decide. After reading the rules, the gameplay surprised me. I enjoy it but it is way too simple for my current tastes. I’m leaning toward selling it. It has a Hanabi vibe, but Hanabi is the better game.

The rules are simple. On his turn, a player plays at least two cards to one of four stacks. Two stacks count up from 1 to 100, the other two count down. Depending on the stack, the cards have to be higher or lower with the exception that cards that are exactly lower or higher by 10, can be played in the opposite direction. Communication between players is limited, specifically it is not allowed to mention numbers. The aim is to play all cards to the stacks. The game ends as soon as a player is not able to play the required number of cards to the stack.

The Game divides the masses. Some love it, others despise it and don't find "the game". I enjoy it but it helps that I enjoy patience as well which it is akin to. It may be true that most games are decided from the beginning and it might not matter what players are doing but I was entertained well the 20 minutes it lasted and we immediately played again to improve our result.

The Game can be played with a 6Nimmt set (cards from 2-99).

I don't mind playing this again. It feels like co-op 6 Nimmt! and there is a decent level of tension included. However, I'm not sure how much of a game The Game actually is as the cards at the bottom of the deck just seem to anyway decide whether you pass or fail.

The solo game is in effect a sort of patience using a nonstandard deck, where luck decides in the end and you cannot win most games (and this is often evident well before you get through half the deck). The multiplayer game is easier in theory but depends heavily on ambiguously restricted communication, and is still strongly luck-dependent unless you violate the spirit of the restrictions.

OPT: It's like a mixture of Six Nimmt! and Hannabi.  I would play it in preference to Hannabi and possibly slightly less than Six Nimmt! at the moment.  A question arises - where is the line between a game and co-operative puzzle solving?

This is a great game with perhaps the worst graphics and theming I've ever seen. Some people may like the "edgy"/pseudo-goth style, but between the font being kind of hard to read at certain angles, to the fact that it just really looks like "not my kind of game", the physical design is a miss for me. It also has the worst, least descriptive title. I've now nicknamed it "you gotta do what you gotta do" or "which pile should I ruin?", both of which seem more apt ;)

That said, in terms of the game itself, I really like playing it. Both the solo and multiplayer versions are fun, and each configuration offers a slightly different challenge and strategy. I like that the concept is pretty easy to understand and there are few rules to explain, so we can get right to playing. 

The difficulty level is high in terms of actually winning, but the game is fulfilling to play even if you rarely win (unless you're a poor sport like my brother). We have a version that includes the "On Fire" expansion, which makes an already nearly impossible game even harder, but I basically only play with the expansion ruleset as a solo game or with my husband, since I actually like my friends and family. This game is also really, really bad for my number-averse and probably dyscalculic mother, but it is conversely really appealing to anyone who tends toward a math-y/logical brain. And, I'm not really much of a math person and I still really like it, so it's not exclusive to math savants either. 

Overall, this game does still have New Game Smell for me, but I very much see it being a staple in my collection for years to come, and I am very close to giving it a permanent spot in my purse as it works great as a solitaire to pass the time.

I LOVE small games with simple rules and win conditions. I like navigating the meta-gaming and creating group rules for what you can and cannot say. I hate the name of the game, but it is almost everything I love about gaming. The only reason I give it a less than perfect score is that since it is pure co-op, if you have one less than engaged player, it really bums out the rest of the group.

A fun little co-op game that feels like Hanabi in the sense that you are attempting to do as best as you can, with the ultimate goal of a perfect game in mind. Players have a hand filled with cards and they are attempting to shed all cards in their hand in four piles, two of which are going up from 1-99 and the others going down from 100-1. A player can only play a card that is appropriate, based on the number out there. Players can also change the count of the cards by decreasing the count by 10 for the 1-99 deck or increasing the count from 100-1 deck, in order to give players more time. Each turn a player plays at least one card and then draws back up to their hand limit.

I enjoyed this one a lot more than I thought I would.  It's a very simple (cooperative) game of counting and deduction, with a little clever communication worked in -- but really, it's quite easy to learn and hard to master. It's very similar to 6 Nimmt, another fiendishly easy-seeming German card game.  This one's easy to get hooked on, and the simplicity and ease of play make it possible to take it just about anywhere.  It can be learned easily, and there's a different dynamic for more players.

The funniest, most incongruous thing about it is the design and conception.  Aside from literally the most generic name imaginable, it's packaged to look like some super-intense, thematically heavy game, with overtones of horror and violence and all kinds of metal shit, when really it's a very simple counting game.

Interesting card game . Not sure of the strategy yet. Only played solo so far and that seems quite difficult. 

With more than 1 player this is a lot better because of the unintentional screwage that happens. The talking is a big part of it and in that respect the game becomes a Hanabi-alike but without the wrong way around cards. I like both of them, this a little better.

It's interesting to me that there are comments proclaiming this game as good solitaire but not cooperatively, and other comments asserting exactly the opposite. There must be something to this game then. eh?

BAD light-weight card game, mostly counting numbers. Best to play this with only 2 players, because it gets dumber with more players. The theme, which exists of exactly 1 graphic of a skull stencil, is just glued on and has nothing to do with what you're doing, which is counting. Really boring. I'm getting bored thinking about the game. Also, why would anyone name their game 'the game'?

It doesn't have the magic of Hanabi, though very similar in style. This one is not as cooperative as I would have liked. However, I think it's a game that ANYBODY can play, so I applaud it for being accessible and potentially bringing new people into the hobby. The "beginner" game (non-expert) is crazy easy with 2 players. My wife and I "beat the game" on our first play, and only had 2 cards left on our second. We have never beat Hanabi, though we have come close (after about a dozen plays). The cards are terrible. They are black (show wear) and have a sort of sinister look to them. All that said, I actually quite enjoy the game. It provides just enough tension, is easy to set up, provides a small footprint, and looks to scale well. A solid filler and a keeper.

The lightest co-op card game that doesn't leave room for alpha players. There aren't any particularly tough decisions and players yelling and screaming are the best part of the game in my opinion.

It's original definitely. Cooperative lining up card, two piles counting down, two piles counting up. It is important to play a following card of precisely 10 higher or lower, that is what you're searching for, but bound by certain rules of communication. A fun exercise for sometimes.

One of the stupidest names for a game ever and the design/style of the cards makes absolutely no sense.

Those gripes aside, this game takes the "multiplayer solitaire" aspect that usually derisively applied to games and uses it as the core mechanic for a game that's a lot of fun.

With limited communication between players and a "good for the group vs. good for me" tension in every play, it does a great job of building tension between players and getting them invested in each hand that's played.

Ein kooperatives Kartenspiel, bei dem alle Mitspieler versuchen nach Möglichkeit alle Karten loszuwerden, in dem die Zahlenkarten jeweils an eine der vier ausliegenden Zahlenreihen anzulegen, wobei zwei aufsteigend und zwei absteigend sind. 

Fazit: Klingt erstmal sehr simpel, ist es im Grunde auch, aber trotzdem nicht ohne Reiz. Das einzig entscheidende ist, dass die Spieler sich untereinander absprechen ohne konkrete Zahlen zu nennen. Dann funktioniert es gut.

Kann man mal mitspielen, aber was dieses Spiel auf der Nominierungsliste für das Spiel des Jahres zu suchen hatte, bleibt mir ein Rätsel.

Had to try this, since it's so easy to try with a 6 Nimmt deck. Works well, and is a nice little puzzle. Simple rules, but an interesting game. Not really my cup of tea, but my son liked this, so I assume we'll play this at least couple of times.

Indifferent.

Really enjoying solo plays, usually several in a sitting: addictive. However, not seeing any point in playing cooperatively. Having to play at least three cards before drawing instead of just two ups the difficulty nicely. [85 plays]

Bei "The Game" hat die Marketingabteilung, in Zusammenarbeit mit der Grafik- und Designabteilung ganze Arbeit geleistet. Mit seinem düsteren Artwork unddem Untertitel "Spiel so lange Du kannst", wirkt The Game auf den ersten Blick wie das offizielle Kartenspiel zu der SAW Filmreihe. Im Prinzip ist das Thema aber austauschbar und biete keinerlei Relevanz zum eigentlich Spiel. The Game ist ein kooperatives Kartenspiel, in dem die Spieler versuchen jede einzelne der 98 Karten abzulegen. Ist dies geschafft, ist The Game besieg. Dafür gibt es 4 Kartenstapel zum "anlegen". An zwei der Stapel muss der angelegte Kartenwert immer niedriger werden, bei den beiden anderen immer höher werden. Die Spieler dürfen sich untereinander nicht absprechen und jeder Spieler ist in seinem Zug gezwunden, mindestens 2 Karten zu spielen. Es klingt relativ einfach? Ist es defintiv nicht! Wir haben The Game bestimmt noch ein gutes Dutzend Mal gespielt und es bisher nicht besiegt. Meistens bleiben nur eine handvoll Karten ürbig, ein Mal hatten wir nur noch eine einzige Karte auf der Hand. The Game ist kein komplexes, tiefsinniges Spiel, aber es macht durchaus Spaß und bietet eine ordentliche Herausforderung.

A cooperative card game which is similar to 11Nimmt! in that you are playing cards out of your hand into a sequence in an attempt to get all cards out of your hand.

RATING: N/A
There is a fine line between what constitutes a game and what constitutes an activity and 'The Game' straddles that line pretty closely. 

Essentially the players are trying to play out their deck of cards in such a way that they can get rid of them all. Using two piles they are able to play their cards such that one piles last value is being decreased and the other increased with each card play, with each pile starting at 1 and 100 respectively. The catch is that if a player can play a number that increases or reduces their total by exactly 10, they can ratchet the value of the pile back to that number. So a player on 87, would love to play 97 as it will see them jump to 97 and give them more breathing room to move with. 

'The Game' is highly addictive but essentially that is it. Everyone's mileage will vary as to how long it remains an amusement.

Fun little filler.  Enjoyed the teamwork in trying to puzzle out how to manipulate the piles without sharing direct information.  The game does not do anything ground breaking, but it is a fun little co-op game.  I have heard some take issue with the card design and I disagree.  I have a lot of bright, happy, colorful games.  While not necessary here, Skulls are a nice change of pace.  Gave this to a friend once I got the Extreme edition.

A cooperative game that supports up to five players. There is a deck of cards from 1-99. Players play cards onto 4 piles, where 2 piles are ascending, and 2 piles are descending. You can only break the ascending/descending rule if you play a card that is exactly 10 higher or lower than the previous card. You are not allowed to talk about specific cards, but you can talk about generalities. The aim is to get rid of cards from the player's hands, with 10 cards or less considered a good score. 

I haven't had a chance to play, but I was watching a 5 player game in action. It looks fun and I want to get in a few hands.

How can such a simple and effective idea not have been done before? Just a handful of rules are enough to produce rising tension and gives players tough decisions but also the opportunity to do clever combos to save the day.

RATING: 9
Great co-op game, easy to learn/teach, easy to play. Harder to win, but a good test of communication between players. Always make it feel like you have to try hard to empty the deck. Nice shorter game.

Needs a little more depth/variation, and more of a theme, to make this a 10 for me.

RATING: 4
Clever game, but I feel there's a fair bit you can't plan in how the cards come out. I just don't know how much planning you can do in this game, and to an extent, you just have to get a bit lucky to get the full set I think.

Anyway, a very interesting idea and could work as a filler, though I don't care for it personally.

Worst name ever for trying to locate on BGG! Not inaccurate though, as The Game is about as simple a design as possible: A deck of cards, numbered 2-99, that you want to entirely play out in ascending or descending order into 4 discard piles. That's basically it.

Not a bad game really. My only complaint is they attempted to slap on some kind of unnecessarily edgy theme to the graphic design. The cards all have skulls on them and the color scheme is all black and red. Why? Like the name, I think the designer just couldn't come up with anything better.

Interessante gioco di carte. Cooperativo alla stile Hanabi e altrettanto simpatico. Come Hanabi le regole le sceglie il gruppo, quanto rigidi e quanto flessibili. L'obiettivo sta nello sbarazzarsi delle carte in mano di tutti i giocatori. Tra i giocatori si può parlare poco, ma le poche informazioni saranno preziose per poter coordinarsi e lavorare di squadra. Due regole per un gioco molto semplice e divertente.

Has a little bit of the Hanabi feeling to it and is quiet enjoyable as a solo game as well as in a group. Has a big "ok, one more try" factor to it, great small coop game. 
After really a lot of plays it's starting to feel "done" though, but for a few € still very recommendable for the amount of playtime I got out of it.

RATING: 9
I really like this as a pleasant filler. Each turn there's a nice decision to make, there's a bit of groan factor, some hand management, and every card draw holds interest. The communication requirements are simple, yet vital. And you're never completely sure how well you're doing, which provides interest throughout. The replay proves surprisingly resilient given there's no theme to bring it on home, explained in part by its perfect length and by avoiding the director problem, and the variants (to play 3 a turn, or with reduced hand size, or both) provide a further boost to longevity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Well-designed co-op hand-management card game. I like it's simplicity. A modern day classic. Easy to teach and play.

IMO, this is more of an exercise or group puzzle than a game.

Terrible title, but it's drifting within the search engines haven't seem to hurt it's success.

RATING: 7
"Clever, simple, abstract co-op which can be played solo. Definitely not my favorite type of game, but quick, simple, and fun. I only have the mobile app so far."

What I like:
- Extremely simple rules
- Plays quickly
- App is a good solo implementation

What I don't like:
- Completely abstract
- I'm not a fan of limited communication games
- Unattractive art
- Seems pretty swingy based on one play

The limited communication rules will work for some groups, and fail completely for others. This will require a group that has compatible opinions about the relative merits of "having fun" and "winning", and are looking for a comparable level of challenge.

Ok neat. Very positively surprised by this game. It's very engaging and interactive. Definitely better than Hanabi for me.

It's totally "qwixx thw card game" but rather than simply converting they re-adapted and it feels totally different despite the game mechanic being pretty much the same. One of ny favourite co-ops at the moment.

It's not Hanabi, but then again, what is?  I feel like there's quite a bit less control in this game, and it often feels like you're making the "least bad" play, but it's also a lot less brain-draining than Hanabi.  Good but not great, and I'm generally willing to fit in a game, which is pretty much the definition of a 7/10 here.

The Game: Spiel... so lange du kannst! got some attention because it was a SdJ nominee, but it didn't really stand out as an abstract cooperative card game. Players play a card numbered 2-99 on one of four piles--two piles starting at 1 where all cards must be larger than the previous, and two piles starting at 100 where all cards must be smaller than the previous. There's the usual embargo on communication that everyone likes to skirt. I'm not a big fan of cooperative games anyway, but this one didn't really do anything clever.

Played using a mocked up version with 6 nimmt cards. It was enjoyable but not sure I need to own it. It's like a slightly more chaotic Hanabi. It also has one of the worst names in existence for a game. So damn hard to search for.

A patience variant that seems to be a calculated exercise in minimalism.

One of my favourite cooperative games. 

This game accomplish that objetive. The idea is interesting and the rules work very well, especially for four players. Obviously, the game has a good amount of luck but in certain way, it can be controled by the players if they talk most of the time each other. 

I would like to better the score, but there are two reasons I don't do it:
1. The name: It doesn't fit at all with the game and obviously, if someone try to find it in internet, they would realize it is difficult to find it. 
2. The art: It is not really bad, but, not sure how to express it, could be more attractive.

Anyway, it is a nice game, it has a lot of replaybility and it does not take a lot of time to play it and understand it.

We were laughing at how bad we were playing. Any game with laughter is a good game in my book. We had fun with it. We failed miserably. It is a tough game. Enjoyable, however. Would definitely play again. 

now I own the rainbow deck. So much better!

This is a fine, but kind of forgettable game where on a player's turn they must play a card into one of four piles twice. The numbers on the cards range from 2 to 99, and two of the piles are decreasing numerically from 100, and two are increasing numerically from 1. If a player has no legal plays, everyone loses. There's a sort of amusing rule where you can backtrack a pile by exactly 10, but while the game is amusing once, with further plays the excitement goes down. You aren't allowed to communicate clearly what's in your hand to other players, so the game has a bit of a hanabi feel to it, but I think it's a little less clever.

I'd barely heard of The Game: Spiel... so lange du kannst! before its Spiel des Jahres nomination, but it sounded quite interesting and it's playable with a 6 nimmt! deck. I cranked out a couple of solo plays, one game with my wife and two with 3p at games night. Solo it feels like playing patience. It's more fun with the group communication element, though the constraints are much less interesting than those in Hanabi. The basic rules also seem a bit too easy; I 'won' all but one of the games. That all sounds a bit negative - I did enjoy the simplicity of the rules and the camaraderie it inspires.

8 - I bought this almost a year ago and never cracked it open. Finally got around to trying it the other night and it's pretty fun as a solo game.  I haven't tried it with others though I imagine the difficulty skyrockets immediately. It reminds me of the things I like about Klondike (solitaire) but it's a little more of a challenge. The art is awful unfortunately.

I've only ever played this solitaire, and with a 6 nimmt! deck to boot, but it's a pretty solid solo Patience/Klondike variant with a neat twist to allow for some recovery. I cannot imagine this one has legs as a group competitive game; once someone comes up with a convention for having a card exactly ten higher or lower than what's out there, what's left? Maybe I'll play this with others one day, but hell, I don't even play it solo any more, so this is all pretty moot, isn't it?

So glad I listened to the reviews and ignored the horrible name and art (why so dark - red/black skulls???). Fantastic game! I have to play solo games more often than I'd like and this is one of the first that I'll grab. I love that it's so hard to truly win and get rid of ALL of the cards.

21-06-2015. Rated after 1 play. The Game seems to be an interesting hidden information/ cooperative game. There are 4 stacks of cards, two go up from 1 and 2 go down from 100. and each player has a hand of 6 cards with numbers in their hand. Each turn, you have to play 2 hand cards. The game ends whe all cards are played OR when players cannot play new cards anymore,

I liked it. The problem of these games is what you think is acceptable when playing these kind of : hidden information" games. What can you share etc? Otherwise I feel the game is interesting and my first play felt better than my first play of Hanabi.

6 nimmt! lapjaival kiválóan játszható, gyakorlatilag pasziánsz típusú játék, teljesen téma nélkül (a koponyák hogy kerültek rá?! nem is értem...)
Elég szórakoztató, és egyszerűsége ellenére van mélysége is. A Hanabi és a 6 nimmt! találkozása, amiben van valami vonzó, ami miatt különösen szívesen rakosgatja az ember a kártyákat.
1-2 játszma után azt vettem észre, hogy valami miatt durván addiktív, mint kb. a windowsos pasziánsz.

I'm a bit disappointed ... this was nominated to the "Spiel des Jahres 2015"? I can't really see why. Nevertheless it's quickly played and adds some challenge to a gaming night opener or filler. I would prefer "Hanabi" (which has at least - if any - more theme) although I don't like coop card games that much. Worst name ever if you want to find the game in the internet.

This game just charms all my friends who try it. We just enjoy the challenge of trying to best play out the cards we get while being limited in what we can tell each other about what we have. I know a lot of people are not fans of the art choice, but I love it and is one of the reasons I picked it up.

My husband insists this game is unwinnable.  I would love to prove him wrong!  We have been down to 7 cards several times and once down to 2 cards but have yet to beat "The Game".  Update:  Made it down to 1 card twice now ... still waiting for a win.  Update 11/18/17:  And finally a win!  Another win on Thanksgiving!  My husband is very competive and really dislikes co-op games but for some reason, this one works for him so gets played often.

Az idei Spiel des Jahres jelöltet ki lehet próbálni a Vigyázzhat lapjaival. Egyedül próbáltam, jó kis pasziánsz. Nem olyan zseniális ötlet, mint a Hanabi, de hajtja az embert az egymás utáni partikba. Kíváncsi vagyok többen jobban működik-e. Nem valószínű. Van mélysége a játéknak, akinek jó a memóriája az biztosan jobb benne, ez annyira nem tetszik.

The Game combines the team play of Hanabi with the drop-in-and-out flexibility of 6 nimmt!  It's hard for me to dislike a game that combines these virtues.  And it's playable with a 6 or 11 nimmt! deck.  It may be a bit too easy at some player counts.

A very interesting co-op. You cannot share specifics about the cards you have in your hand but between the players you need to play all the cards between 1 and 100...in ascending or descending order. I've played this mostly 2 or 3 player but also attempted the solo variant. I think this will get lots more plays as it's incredibly simple to teach but a good challenge.

RATING: 7
First of all, way to make a game almost impossible to find in any online database or store by naming it "The Game".

This is a really simple and entertaining coop card game.  Each player gets dealt a hand of cards from a deck numbered 2-99.  The board starts with 4 piles.  2 that start at 100 and count down and 2 that start at 1 and count up.  The goal is to take turns playing at least 2 cards from your hand on one of the 4 piles going in the correct direction.  The one caveat is that you can go the other direction if your card is exactly 10 higher or lower than the current top card.

I think the biggest hurdle with this very simple game is deciding how you are allowed to communicate.  Games like this that try to limit your communication in order to work can always be tricky.  The rules say you can give some vague information but never exact numbers but that leaves a lot of wiggle room.  My first game we completely extinguished the deck which when the game was introduced to us we were told that is nearly impossible.  This makes me wonder if we maybe were a little too generous with our communication.

At any rate I enjoyed it for what it was, a light, coop card game.

Quick card coop game. It is similar to Hanabi where you are trying to put cards in order, expect you only see your cards and cannot tell anyone else what your cards are.

Played with 6 Nimmt! deck. Probably wouldn't have tried without the SdJ nomination 
A good game but Hanabi does it better.
-Depending on how much communication you allow you can impart a hell of a lot of information. In our first game we ended up with 6 unplayed cards and didn't come close to breaking the letter of the law (rules).
-I think were it falls down for me is that the heuristics seem quite simple. Try to play close cards whenever possible whilst collecting at least one (of the 10) potential reverse movement sets. 
-Perhaps these change with the advanced (3 card) variant or with more than 2 players but I don't see how. 
-There's also significant card tracking involved which is little more than busy work. 
-Solo gamers should get a kick out of it. 
-Wifey likes it more than Hanabi

tl;dr: [thing=98778][/thing] with more numbers, less colors and no memory element.

But the memory element is the heart of Hanabi you say? Sure, but that doesn't stop this game from throwing it over board and still offering a similar kind of challenge. What I like about this game is that it probably still is challenging after you figure out the lingo, something that can't be said about Hanabi. Once you figure that out, it's not very interesting at all. What I don't like about this game is that all of the challenge that is left is down to dumb luck, but also the name. This is a really dumb name for a game. And by the way, wasn't there a game called Das Spiel already?

RATING: 7
First and foremost, the name of this game sucks. It took me an incredibly long time to find this game on BGG. "The Game" pulls up a zillion games and this one wasn't in the first page of results. I had been told that the full names was The Game: Are you Ready to Play? but that didn't work either. I found the game online as The Game: Are you Ready to Play the Game? and that didn't work either. I finally tracked it down as The Game: Spiel... so lange du kannst! Come on! Ugh.

So it's pretty straightforward. There are four play piles that start at 100, 100, 1, and 1. The games has cards numbered 2 - 99. Every player draws 6 cards. Your group cooperatively tries to play all the cards. If you succeed you win.

You can only play cards according to the following rules. A) the piles that start at 100 can only accept a lower number than what is shown... unless you can play a card exactly 10 higher. B) the piles that start a 1 can only accept a higher number than what is shown... unless you can play a card exactly 10 lower. On your turn you must play 2 cards (until the draw deck runs out, then 1) but you could always play more. You draw back up to 6 after you are done playing. If you can't play a card, you lose. If you play all the cards, you win. And that's the game.

The game is interesting and it was fun to play. Trying to communicate without being able to name cards is funny... but ultimately it feels like the game will be decided by the luck of the draw more than anything else. There's a few interesting decisions, like whether you should play more cards to get them out of your hand even if it damages a pile more than you might care for. But mostly, it'll be luck if what you do is right or not. There's clearly ways to play badly, but playing well doesn't particularly guarantee you any success. I just don't feel like there's much to this game. It was fun to play, but it was just as fun to watch... and I didn't really feel like I had any more impact on the outcome when I was playing than when I was watching.

About [thing=173090][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=173090][/thing] is probably the worst game to look after using a search function if you don't know its surname. It is also a cooperative card game about hand management.

It comes with a extremely simple set of rules, plays rather fast, constantly offers decisions you could classify as "bad", "worst" and "terrible".

While it is possible to play up to 5 people, it is almost an unwinnable luckfest with 5 and is random with little chance of winning with 4 unless you are favored by the gods. Three is the sweet spot, and with two it can be too easy. Talk about escalation problems.

Even if it isn't great with all number, it sure does a fine job when playing with 3 or 2 (ok, maybe even with 4), as it is challenging, easy to get into, plays rather fast, takes very little space and has almost zero set up and tear down.

The production value is on the OK level: its just regular cards on a small box.

Overall, [thing=173090][/thing] surprised, as it brought more fun than I thought it would, enough we played it several times and it has become an staple in the leisure time while off work.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
There are 98 cards on the deck, going from 2 to 99. Each player receives certain amount of cards depending on the number of players. On each turn the person must play at least two cards, and is allowed to play more.

Some communication between players is allowed, but everyone should keep their cards a secret and don't talk directly about them ("I have a 45").

There are, four piles: two descending and two ascending. Cards can be played in any of these, but must follow the order (up or down) - the exception for this is playing a card exactly 10 numbers higher or lower: I can, for instance, play a 12 card if a 22 is the top one in an ascending pile (or a 32 if the pile was an descending one) - going against the order and giving more room to play other cards.

Players draw back to their hand size once they have finish their turns. When there isn't more cards to be drawn, is only mandatory to play 1 card instead of 2.

The game ends as soon as someone can't play a card, or when all the cards have been played. If all cards have been used, players won! If not, and there were less than 10 cards yet to be played when the game finished, is considered that the players have done a good job (still a defeat, though). On the other cases, is just losing. 

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Truly only one: which card to play and in which pile. Since is mandatory to play at least 2 cards for most of the game, players are, usually just trying to prevent big jumps in numbers - and, many of the times, the cards to be played are obvious, meaning: no decision at all, or simply a matter of counting and seeing which will cause the less damage.

Since communication is allowed, even if restricted, is possible to coordinate plays up to a point.

Not really hard thinking going on around here.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Small and portable;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Fast playing;
- Hard to have an alpha player telling what others should do;
- Language independent;
- Challenging, and has a way of calling for repeated plays.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Even though the 4 piles in asceding and descending order are a very good idea that makes the play less random, there is still plenty of luck left in the mechanics;
- Doesn't escalate in number of players all that well;
- Very light on decisions.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
For most of the time like you are an incompetent person.  You try to explain that you don't want to take that 20 numbers dive, but you had to play a card! Someone then accuse you of being a traitor and wants you to show your loyalty card, you traitor! There is none in this game - but sure feels like there are plenty of people (yourself included) trying to bring down (or up) the whole thing. Is an exercize in frustration - you want to do better, you want others to do better, maybe DON'T playing on that... oh, dear you just played there? Why?! And a 27? Do you understand the rules? Damn! Sure, sure, you don't have anything better to play and need to play. Go tell a priest!

Ah, hum. Well. [thing=173090][/thing] is an abstract card game, however it most definitely can bring some discussions and feelings to the table - some elation, but mostly dark ones: I get why there is a skull on the cards.

In the end, [thing=173090][/thing] worked much better than I could expect: I want to play it more and more. It is just so easy to bring along, to open the box, teach and play, and these, alongside the challenge presented, meaning constant defeat and wanting to do better, in spite of its flaws, makes for a winner. Recommended!

The Game is up for the SDJ for 2015 and I would be surprised if this game won the award. There is nothing particularly wrong with the game, but as a cooperative game where one has to develop your own "language" during game play, it is inferior to Hanabi in several ways. First, unlike Hanabi, there is absolutely no theme. Worse, instead of no theme, it has a pseudo-horror, macabre-inspired art design. What gives? Could they not have put some pretty background instead? Flowers, bugs, bees, birds, lozenges, anything? I hate griping about art and I rarely do, but heck, even some random abstract design that does not look so morbid would work. Hanabi's theme is tacked on and silly, yes, yet the fireworks display works. The colors are pretty and I do feel "a bit" involved in setting up a fireworks display. Also, to go along with the theme, how about a better title for your game instead of "The Game"?

Perhaps the biggest gripe I have about The Game is that I find that communication is limited to indicating whether you like to put your cards in one row over the next and even then, whether you merely "like" or "love" to place cards in the row. Granted, I have been slightly influenced by Game Night, but boy, there sure aren't a whole lot of ways you can put down the cards and inform other players about your intention. Plus, most of the time, there are clearly a handful of choices to put down cards with the remainder of the cards being bad options.

To be fair, I will put in a few good points about the game: the game plays fairly quick, easy to teach and portable. If you have a deck of 6 Nimmt!, you can play it by pulling out a few cards from the deck.

I think overall, I'd much rather play Hanabi as a cooperative game. The Game just doesn't work for me as much.

Awkwardly relies on players finding a middle ground where they discuss plans somewhat without outright planning everything out to perfection.  Enjoyable enough, but nothing terribly special.

This has become my new "20 minute filler" for any # of players 3-5.  2p is too tough.   The cooperative nature makes this a pretty easy sell and it can be explained in 2 minutes to new players.

Nothing special to look at and I would go as far as to say the box almost puts me off playing it - looks like it may be Uno or Phase 10 or the like. However it is worth playing. A good fun filler, a co-operative one at that. Two playing and only got as good as 7 cards left, so it is not so easy as it seems when explained. A great filler.

RATING: 8
Not really a "filler" game.  More like a "compromise" type of game wherein somebody isn't wiling to spend an hour or so for a full game, yet is willing to play a slightly longer game than a mere filler.  Quite a satisfying finish to the game when you and your partner(s) end up winning!  A bit of luck factor, but also manipulations enable the game to be adjusted during play.

An overconfident and stupid title.  How is anyone supposed to find this online?  Typing "The Game" in the BGG search box - in quotation marks, looking for an exact match - led me to Star Wars X-Wing (top hit!) and 50 pages of other games.  I finally resorted to a designer search, and by the time I was done I hated The Game even more than immediately after playing.

Anyway, The Game is cooperative solitaire done wrong.  My least favorite co-op ever, despite the pseudo-cannibalistic art and burnt orange shading.

Not a whole lot to this one, and I definitely wouldn't play it all the time. But so far it's been good and everyone has enjoyed working together. Great length for what it is.

A really nice little co-op card game. Players must play cards numbered 2-99 into four piles in the middle, with the goal being to play all cards. If a player can't make a legal play, everyone loses. Dead easy to teach and quite tense, it's a good warm-up game.

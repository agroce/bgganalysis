Based on 1 play.  I liked the game, but found the strategy hard to grasp at first - I was distracted by the various points on the board and trying to play for them.  On reflection I think at first its just best to focus on maximising the number of towns you can get blocks on.

RATING: 7.5
Very light set collection and route-planning, but has some light strategy to it.

I had to buy this game mainly for the wife, as it seemed to be a non-confrontational, relatively light game, with a bit of luck that played well with 2.  Well the game certainly fit all of those criteria, and it gets bonus marks, as it actually has some subtle strategy to it, and it's a game that will get regular playtime.

If you like games like Elfenland, where you have to plan out your routes, and Showmanager, where you have to manage your hand carefully (plus it also has the "clear the board" aspect to it), and if you like variable player powers (which I certainly do), then this is a solid lightweight game for 2-4 players.  Nothing terribly original, but it works.  The theme neither adds to nor detracts from the game, except maybe if you're from Germany.

If this game ends up winning the SdJ (turns out it did, surprise, surprise), it's more a reflection of the weakness of the award rather than the greatness of this game.  That said, this is still a fairly safe and solid purchase, assuming you know you're not getting a "gamer's game".  

Own the [boardgame=27690]Power & Glory[/boardgame], [boardgame=33261]All Roads Lead to Rome[/boardgame], and [boardgame=25293]Courier[/boardgame] expansions.

The Power & Glory expansion adds a new map which is great for replay value; you can either play with the original rules or with a new, significant rule change (horses).  I only play with the original rules, as the new rule change removes one of the main aspects of the game (tension).

Seems a bit too easy - the basic strategy that seems to work best (at least in two player games): go for the "all-but-white" 6-point tile, even not dropping houses on white even, if you can. Start on the left side, since it'll be easier to drop more houses on a five-card route. Remember that Lodz, Innsbruck, and Sigmaringen are the most important cards to get for this - so hoard them if you're opponents trying to get at them and you've got the space in your hand. Once you've gotten this, keep filling in to get the small region tiles. Finally, the reason this works so well, you can dump a ton of houses into white in one route (and get a 5/6/7 tile as well).

RATING: 7
As a 2 player game, I'd give it an 8, it's very strategic, but as 4 player game, it takes a long time, and the strategy is almost lost.  It's a bit like Alhambra: strategic with less players, luck fest with more players.  The current rating is for 3 players.

Thurn and Taxis is a surprisingly fun family game. Compared to Ticket to Ride, it's somewhat more complex, but it is also less cutthroat while still having a good feeling of competition. For people who like harsh competition Thurn and Taxis will probably feel boring, but for people who sometimes feel frustrated while playing Ticket to Ride (after seeing another player take the route they wanted), this is a game I would recommend trying.

130929 Just never built up much of any interest in replaying this game.  I wouldn't pass on a play, but I would suggest something else first.

100730 Interesting game, I see how it won the SDJ though I also suspect why I can see its kind of dropped off the map.  Its a fun set collecting game and I am really interested in playing it again even as I fear it might not have a long term hold on my interests.  I have a friend who swears that he does not see the similarity between TtR and this game, but I do see the similarity, the feel of the two games are quite similar but I think this seems like a much nicer way to make a more "complex" ttr-like game instead of all those official expansions.

I do agree with the poll, its not great 2P.  It needs a touch of chaos that extra players bring.

RATING: 3
Kind of like Ticket to Ride (I guess) in that you collect sets of cards to make routes (kind of) and get points, but is missing a few key things I like about Ticket to Ride:
-Trains. Trains are [i]way[/i] cooler than mail carriages.
-Familiar cities. A map of the US is just cool and more familiar.
-Easier setup and simpler rules.
-Direct interaction with other players. In TtR, you compete for tracks and routes and block other players from using them. You can't do anything like that in Thurn and Taxis.
-A cool theme. Did I mention trains are cooler than mail carriages? Maybe if the game was rethemed as "Turnin' Taxis" and set in New York City and players build up taxi cab companies, I'd like it more.
-Tension; it just doesn't have any.
-It's really freaking lame, by comparison.

Pleasant route-building game with some fantastic board artwork. Personally, I find the game very RELAXING for some reason. It's laid-back without being boring. It also plays relatively quickly and affords several interesting decisions (press-your-luck being a notable mechanic that is employed brilliantly).

T&T is great fun... the comparisons to TtR and WoP are understandable, but this is a unique game. Bonus awards are key in this one. Don't get too caught up in playing long routes, unless you are playing in the white province. Keep up with the Joneses, and figure out how to hit as many provinces as possible with only a few cards. Always keep a playable card in your hand. This one will win the SdJ for 2006. UPDATE: It won. It was a pretty easy prediction.

Great game once you've cleared you head of all thoughts of TtR - they are not alike at all, except for the appearance of routes.

I enjoy every play of this game. I like the artwork, too. Quite thematic and appropriate art. Nice idea to use real historic building images.

The game has much the same ease of play as TtR, but doesn't get the same exposure, hence a little less popularity, but check the rating - it's good.

Well worth giving it a go IMHO.

My feel of the game is that this is Ticket to Ride Solitaire. I'd like to have more player interaction. 

2016
This is a game in which the starting player has a significant advantage over the others. Basically the game is a race to reach certain goals and there is no catch-up mechanism. There is very little interaction since all you can do to prevent your opponents from reaching the goals before you is to pick up the cards they want. In an optimal situation you want the same cards but most of the time blocking is a move wasted, thus resulting in status quo or a third player gaining an edge. Of course you can play well or bad, but there is little you can do about the luck of draw.

Why it's previously-owned:
I got this at a time that we had pretty much moved out of the gateway game phase for the majority of our group.  There wasn't a lot of strategic depth to keep us coming back for more.

In Thurn and Taxis, players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways. The board shows a map of all the towns, with roads leading from each one to some its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with one or two towns, and a large region with all the Bavarian towns in the center. With the right strategy, this game lets players build routes and stagecoaches, found offices in cities and expand into new countries. All the while making good use of public departments and having a lucky hand when planning new routes.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]Repeated shuffling during setup can feel tiresome, even though this is when strategies can be thought through.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The order of the cards is vital, yet equally important is learning what to do with suboptimal postal routes.

:thumbsdown: Once the player has mastered the decision making process, the level of difficulty feels noticeably lighter.

1st play: Plays very quick, good blend of push your luck, route building and hand management.  Good production, though I think I'd like it better with American city names since it's hard to remember which cities are where.  A minor quibble, the game is solid and easy to introduce as a gateway+ game.

2nd play: Good gateway game, enough luck to make it so that players of different skill can compete, but interesting enough to be enjoyable for me.    I like the variety of routes and the temptation to push for good routes vs when to lock in your gains is fun.

FAMILY, STRATEGY

Thurn and Taxis feels like a more complex version of Ticket to Ride. Players build postal networks throughout Austria, Switzerland, Germany, and Poland. There isn't much in the way of defensive play or direct confrontation here--the confrontation is the competition to be as efficient and fast as possible to win. Maggie and I soon figured out not to focus on the carriage cards, but the bonus tiles.

Recommended with 2-4 players (best 3-4). 60 mins.

This game involves in linking postal routes in Europe.  With cards of cities in hand, players placed cards of adjacent cities to form their postal routes.  A minimum of 3 cities must be connected before players can score and proceed to start a new route.  

4 super powers are their to help players in the game and they are allowed to use 1 of them in each round of the game.

There are various ways to score in the game, link up cities of the same region, be one of the first players to link up at least 5 cities, or the first one to end the game.  A game that combines luck, strategies and planning.

Good points: Easy to play.  This game requires some advance thinking during each round.  Every decision made by players are crucial to the game.

Bad points: After a few rounds, players might be able to get the formula to winning the game and have an advantage in winning the game over other players.  It can be frustrating that players cannot get their necessary city cards for connecting purposes but this is also the challenge of this game.

This game is very similar to Ticket to Ride, but I would prefer this to Ticket to Ride.  This game includes the 4 super powers which players can make more decisions to determine the game.  However in Ticket to Ride, it is more of a luck based game compared to Thurn and Taxis.

Lots of similarities to Ticket to Ride. Overall I like this game and will happily play but I think this is one that I don't want to buy because it's too similar to games I already own. Thurn and Taxis has a few more choices and some extra tactics over TtR but not enough to elevate it to much of a heavier game. It's probably about the same weight as TtR: Marklin. If I want to play a lighter game like this TtR is fine and the Marklin version I would prefer. For nongamers I think TtR is a better choice.

The theme is pasted on, but there's no glue bleeding through anywhere! The board and bits are simply beautiful. It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a deep game (either in rules complexity or in strategy), but some strategic thought is required. Yes, there is little player interaction at first glance, but that all depends on how you choose to play it: you MUST constantly be aware of what your opponents are up to. T&T goes by quickly, and this makes it nicely tense.

2-4(3,4)

Clearly, similar "route-building" gameplay to TtR, but it's hard for me to say which I like better. T&T has no blocking of routes, of roles, of nearly anything with, I guess, the exception of taking a card that your opponent would clearly want. But even so, with the Administrator, it seems like you can essentially ensure that you'll have a play. If you don't, and have to scrap a route, I'd have to imagine that it's essentially game over (soft player elimination).

And then, even if you do take Administrator (and likely "save" your route) you probably lost a crucial iota because your turn was slightly sub-optimal (by not taking or placing two cards). Games with a "bail-out" mechanism in which you make a losing move but the game structures it such that you don't "feel" like its a losing move annoy me. Make losing moves obvious, and losing! I hate the subterfuge of taking a bad move, but the game hand-waving it to make it seem like it wasn't so bad. To be fair, though, I can see taking Administrator a few times each play-through ... it's relying on Administrator that can lose you a game.

ANYway, this is pretty much pure logistical optimization. I guess there are interesting decisions: whether to rush the carriages or get house coverage. House placement too often feels too straightforward, and I miss blocking. Still, you do need to be aware of everybody's status on routes and carriages, but I suspect your best move will often be just to optimize your own routes. I'm not sure how long I'll go with this one, as it's awkwardly in between a solid gateway (which TtR accomplishes famously) and heavier games (I currently lack a group for these, but I have little issue getting a brain-burner to the table against my wife).

I have played the game twice now (both times where 2-player games) and liked the game. Simply rules, simple play. I'd gotten into such a Tiket to Ride rut (take a card or play a card) that it took awhile to catch onto the order of play (take a card and then play a card), but other than that it played out pretty well.

Slightly deeper than Ticket to Ride and yet every bit as accessible.  Beautiful board.  Quick to teach.  We just love it.

Update: Eight years later, played not with my old gaming group (pensive, chatty, gamerific) but with my 9.5yo (pensive, quiet, gamerific). He's played a lot of Ticket to Ride and wasn't terribly impressed with T&T. It suddenly felt to me as dry as the Griswold's turkey breast. Seems like some redundant mechanisms in there. He did like the pretty board and geography lesson. Dropping the rating to a 6 with kids.  Splitting the difference (math in the cockpit) lands T&T down at 7.5

RATING: 6.5
Good gateway eurogame. Easy and fast to teach and play. The main idea is to complete routes on the map by using cards. Like Ticket to Ride. Thurn and Taxis is gives you more freedom of play (you dont have the destination cards so you are free to make your own routes) which results in a more tactical game with more options but on the other hand Ticket to Ride has the 'wow' factor with the colourful board and the plastic trains.

Never really got into this, potentially looks more interesting tham Ticket to Ride, but the theme and design seem less appealing somehow. Seems better 3p than 2p.

Something about this misses the fun factor for me.  I think it's problem is that you are at the mercy of the cards and there's only 2 winning strategies: go for all the colors or go for gray.  Gets pretty boring pretty fast.  Although all my games have been with 2 players.  Maybe it's more fun with 3 or more.

Was initially pretty impressed with this game as it sported some nice components and rules which could be easily taught to family members and non-gaming friends.  However after repeated plays the gameplay just doesn't hold up for me anymore.  The choices presented aren't really all that difficult nor compelling as its fairly obvious to each player about which official to use, what cards to collect, where to extend your route and when to call your route in for points/ bonuses.  Overall, a decent race/ press your luck route connection game which some may favor due to the absence of player confrontation.  For a better family route building experience with added excitement, tension, player interaction and even simpler rules, see Ticket to Ride.  Or for a route connection game which has a lot more going on with just as complex rules as this, see On the Underground.

{100  plays, 2-4 players} I suspect my rating could drop a point in a year or so, after we all stop playing this one as much.  But for now, I dig the route-planning puzzley part, the second-guess your opponents part, the offensive vs. defensive card draw part, the hand management part, and the long routes vs. short route/cartwright part.  A fun little race, that surprisingly works better with 2 or 3, I think, than with the full 4.

*** UPDATE 10/07/07 [initial rating: 8] ***

Ha.  My suspicions were wrong.  Mostly due to how much I enjoy this as a 2-player on BSW.  This game is still terrific, still has a nice balance between building long routes for the extra points or short routes for tempo, and still offers those wonderful decisions of how best to deal with the cards you are presented with - both offensively and defensively.  The only reason this isn't a 10 for me is the four-player game: the length there doesn't quite match the depth for me, though obviously that's also player-dependent... but even still, the four-player game always feels... off for some reason.  But only a tad.  This is still a wonderful design.

Significantly better than Ticket to Ride.  Placing the houses in either one of each region or all in one region make the tactics/strategy much deeper.  Also picking the 3 (4?) different roles adds a bit of extra spice that TtR lacks.

[ESP] Me gusta bastante este juego. Sin embargo puede ser algo injusto cuando no tienes la opci√≥n de robar cartas que te sirvan. Esto lo resolvieron con la expansion Power & Glory. Desde que la tengo no he vuelto a jugar con el mapa base.

*********************************

Construir rutas de correo recolectando puntos de distintas formas (regiones, largo de rutas, presencia, etc). El mapa tiene los pueblos y las rutas entre ellos. Hay varias regiones (comunas) a lo largo del mapa En cada turno se roba una carta de pueblo, y luego se bota una carta de la mano en frente del jugador formando la ruta de correo. Las cartas colocadas deben respetar los caminos, por lo que si no puede ser extendida de forma legal se pierde la ruta. Si la ruta tiene al menos 3 cartas se puede declarar. Se debe decidir si poner las casas en cada pueblo de la ruta en 1 regi√≥n, o en 1 pueblo de cada regi√≥n.

A decent game, though I felt that my choices were dictated a little bit too much by the available cards (it's a matter of, with those cards up, how do I make the best of the situation, rather than what is my plan, and how can I implement it the best).  The strategy just felt a little bit forced by the game system, though it was certainly a fun game to play.

Gamers' Ticket to Ride. Many different ways to score points and many different strategies you can take. Finding efficiency in your routes to build as many post offices as you can in new cities is key.

A fine 'connection' game with interesting game play options.  It is in the same family of games as Ticket to Ride, but the two games should not be compared by their mechanics, but by their feel.  Both have a luck of the draw element and both reward players who note what their opponents are up to.  The difference lies in the fact that connections are an 'end' in T2R while they are a 'means' in T

Fairly simple game that has limited player interaction and can be considered a nice friendly game.  The little player interaction is based on who completes objectives first.  The earlier you complete an objective the more points you get.  I find it plays best with 3  people.  It's one of a few games in my collection that my wife and her friends are happy to play.  Not as deep and strategic as I normally like but a good game over all

Third game benefited from finally sorting out (I think) the carriages and Cartwright rules (RG version).  Minimal way to affect opponents' scores - get a scoring tile first, use the administrator to remove a card the next player wants  - but this can be a plus in a family situation.  Karen's influence?  The officials provide the Seyfarth signature following Puerto Rico.  Nicely balanced, quite bland, not the best SdJ, but not the worst.   Happy to play.

Light-to-medium weight networking and planning game, roughly the same game weight and game length as Web of Power. Not sure why people are comparing this to Ticket to Ride, other than the card draw. For some reason, the game makes me think of a kinder, gentler Amazonas. The reason being that TnT is a networking game with specific targets and bonuses that drive the game. It's less nasty than Amazonas in that you can't block people from entering a town entirely (unless you grab the cards for a specific city) and has no income management component to worry about. It plays well with 2. I have some minor concerns regarding the granularity of the scoring with 4 as the scoring can be very tight. Also not sure whether the 1pt bonus for ending the game is fair/necessary as it would seem to reward those earlier in the turn order and ending the game as early as possible is something you should be aiming for anyway. A tentative 7.5 after 10 plays on BSW.

I like this a bit more than Ticket to Ride. It's interesing scoring from acheivements of longer routes and filling in the map with your own depots.
In a way it makes me think of tetris - you are laying down custom shapes trying to complete a different "row" as you go.

The element of choice about how to score your route is very interesting too. Lots of skill right Giles - I mean I won afterall!

The GF fell in love with the 2006 SdJ at first play, so it starts with a respectable 7.5. It surely deserved its prize, as it is a fast and funny little great family game.
The whole business is about efficiency: the depth of the game is not great, but it is fairly short and not overstays its welcome. Definitely enjoyable even with 2 or with non-gamers.

Update september 8th, 2013: I still enjoy the game, but it is a bit out of rotation. Rating downgraded to 7.

Many playings on BSW and several f2f.

I have really enjoyed the game more and more with each subsequent playing.  The more experienced your opponent(s) the more the game becomes dependent on other players moves, rather than just a "multiplayer solitaire."  I enjoy the set collection, hand management and scoring mechanisms in the game.

Recommended.

RATING: 5
A race to the finish trying to score as many points along the way as possible and thus denying your opponents the same. This is done by completing regions and being first to upgrade your connections. Occasionally you can remove city links that your opponents need, but I'm not sure if that's worthwhile versus just maximizing your points.

Here is yet another game that I would prefer as a gateway over TtR.  Maybe that's just b/c it's new to me, or maybe I like the theme better, or maybe it reminds me the slightest bit of Hansa Teutonica, which is a pretty good game.

RATING: 9
Played this twice the other night and can't get it off of my mind, hence the 9 rating.  Hadn't even been on my "scope" after hearing the comparisons to TTR, but a buddy had it and asked if I wanted to play.  I'm glad I did.  So much to think about; trying to jump in to get the points in each region, which "special power" to use each turn to maximize its effectiveness, how fast to upgrade carriages, etc.  Can't wait until I make my next game order:  T&T will definitely be a part of it!

Personally, this game has more going for it than Ticket to Ride for me. More hand management, more long term strategy, more rewarding to win.
Even though you don't block each other, you still claim victory points in a diminishing order, so your actions still affect the other players.
I will admit: The post office placement rule takes a few explanations to grasp fully.

[b]Spiel des Jahres 2006[/b]
[COLOR=#959595][SIZE=7]Deutscher Spiele Preis 2nd Place 2006[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[i]Posted: 12/23/07, Rated: 10[/i]

I've got a ticket to ride the Pony Express.

I have to admit that I suffered from a bit of [i]Thurn & Taxis[/i] backlash last year: there had been so much written about it, and my first attempts to learn it on BSW were less than stellar.  The theme of creating postal routes felt forced and uninteresting.  Role selection has become a common component of Euro games, so it didn't feel novel this time around.  Still, I collect games which have won the [i]Spiel des Jarhes.[/i]  I dutifully picked up a copy.

[i]Thurn & Taxis[/i] finally made it to the table.  And WOW!  Giddyup, horsies!  It really is an awesome game.

First, I think the board is gorgeous.  The color palette is wonderfully subdued, the artwork exquisite with pictures of actual historical buildings.  A page naming each building is included, and it is a nice touch.  I probably butcher the names of most of the towns while playing since they're all German, but the combination of these names plus the board really captures an "old world" feel.  The cards are small like those found in [i][gameid=9209][/i], well drawn and richly colored.

[i]Thurn & Taxis[/i] bears more than a passing resemblance to [i][gameid=9209][/i] in other areas as well.  You are attempting to complete a route by collecting a set of cards.  There are face-up cards on the table from which you can select, or you can draw "blind" from the deck.  Unlike [i][gameid=9209][/i], the routes aren't laid out for you.  There are roads between towns, but the route you are trying to construct can meander however you see fit within certain limitations.  The method of laying out your cards is a novel concept.  Each round, you must add to the "route" you are creating, by placing a card on either end of the set of cards you already have in play.  In this manner, you extend your route -- but you are also limited in which cities you can use to do so.  If you don't have any cards which represent cities connected to the cards on the end of your route, then you have to scrap your route and start over.  This can be a severe setback.  You have to adjust your route selection and card draws as appropriate.

Since you can't be locked out of a particular link, some of the "push your luck" from [i][gameid=9209][/i] is missing: you're never stuck waiting for your turn to come around, hoping that no one steals the link from Las Vegas to Los Angeles.  This removes some of the tension of [i][gameid=9209][/i], and resulted in a more social experience at the table.  There are also several different ways to accumulate points in [i]Thurn & Taxis[/i] which ultimately means different ways to win.  I feel as though [i][gameid=9209][/i] has been "solved" as a game: get your big east-west track laid, connect to several cities in the East, then raid the Destinations deck towards the end of the game.  Scores in [i]Thurn & Taxis[/i] end up being closer together, so this feeling of being "solved" has yet to set in for me.

The implementation of roles isn't new, and the "powers" these roles impart are pretty straightforward.  They essentially grant you an extra action each turn: you can draw an extra card, you can play an extra card, you can refresh all of the face-up cards (an excellent option if you're looking at the possibility of discarding your current route), or else "closing" and scoring a route with some help to make it an appropriate length.  These roles take what would normally be a boring set collection game, and effectively add that "wish you could do just one more thing" angst.  You can take two cards, but then you'll only be able to play one.  You could only take one card and then play two, but then you'll still be one short before you'll be able to score the route.  These considerations also provide an extra layer of strategy: how quickly can you gain the cards for a route, play them in sequence, and yet carry the maximum number of cards (three) into your next turn?  Careful role selection can help you to find the proper balance.

[i]Thurn & Taxis[/i] is a more open route creation game, removing some of the tension and conflict from [i][gameid=9209][/i], while also providing multiple paths to victory.  Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night stays this game from swiftly being a triumph.

When TuT has been released, I liked the graphics/art of the gameboard and the cards. And when I read the first reviews I thought 'what a simple game' because you only have 2 actions: Take a card (to collect) and (if you want to) lay a route. That's too stupid...? No, it works very well. In every turn you have to decide on which route you should concentrate, what towns to take... a.s.o.
Nice family game!

RATING: 7
Last played with 3 players which works excellent. The game is not heavy and does not take too long to learn. The goal is to create the best postal service in old germany from what i understand and players compete in making routes through the counties. The player first to win a county will be awarded most points and the next player to finish that county will be awarded 2nd most points. To add to the twist you get points for being the first to make a longer route aswell as the first to have run a route and placed a postal office in each county. 
The first time you play it's pretty hard to grasp which tactics are the best and everything is decided by where your route can take you next. The key is to know when to end it as the player who first makes a route through 7 cities will end the game during that last turn. If you are in the lead it might be a good idea to worry about getting the long routes before competition can catch up. 

All in all a fun game.

A nice game, plays in about 45 minutes and reminds me in many ways of TTR, Web of Power, and Showmanager. Theme is unique, and the gameplay reminds one of some of the early Rails games from Martin Wallace. Excellent choice for a medium to light weight opener.

Obviouis simularities with Ticket To Ride but with a few more strategies thrown in. But does this make it a better game? After one play I'm not sure.

Subsequent on line games have shown this one to be too luck dependant, pivoting on the card draws. After trying various option in several games it seems that this one either falls into your lap or it doesn't which makes this a deeply irritating game.

This game looks like Ticket to Ride but plays much different. The biggest difference is the way you place your postal route buildings. One of each color or all of one color. The end always seems abrupt to me. You have to be very careful when not playing last.

T&T is a nice simple route building game with a little push your luck element thrown in for good measure. I rate it so highly because it's one that my father enjoys and will always play with me.

RATING: 8.5
It probably can be found at the heart of the Elfenland, Kardinal & Koenig and Atlantic Star triangle, with the player interaction seriously lost in the Bermuda fog.

Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful game, looks pretty, plays quick, doesn't burn the brain, keeps everyone reasonably involved through various balances, maybe favours people who are offered the right card mix at the start of their turn but not so much that it will turn others off. A great filler, a perfect family game that fully deserves its Spiel des Jahres prize.

I'm taken in, but certainly not bowled over. If it had a wee bit more player interaction, especially a more effective way to make a leader's position a bit harder than burning their target cards and pray that the replacement isn't any better, I am certain I would like this a lot more. The prominence that the four postal officials have been given on the board certainly suggest that they had a slightly different allocation mechanic than the one present now. It so looks like a space where the game can show which role is assigned to which player.

Burning cards to get a better pick-up pool is seriously expensive, as you are starting to run 1 card behind everyone else's hand pools, and probably give the person following you 2 good cards in the process. If you compare it to how easy it is to complete a route with 2 cities missing, and what the rewards are if that strategy gets to its 7th route, then the burning ability is probably not worth using at all. Winners will be found amongst those who execute "pick-up 2, play 2" to maximum effect. "Complete route early"-strategies are devastating when they aren't countered by "over-build"-strategies that aim for maximum route length bonuses and house placements from the word go. A mixture of the strategies always seem to fall short by a turn or two. Don't build in the area where the person on your left is also active if you can avoid it. 

There are enough ways to win, or try to, to keep me interested, and the luck of the draw guarantees that all players will face different ebb and flood moments. But a player who gets the key cards at the right moment will be hard to beat. And the more people play, the harder the last player needs to work to keep up, as that player needs to get the right cards for the opening that is left, whereas earlier players can decide how to commit themselves based on the cards available, since the higher points are available from more places on the board. Best played with less people than the maximum 4.

We were wondering if their wasn't a variation possible that would allocate a special power to a player (the engineer role swapping of Canal Mania spring to mind) would make it (even) better?

I've only played this game once, but I very much enjoyed it.  It melds some of the aspects of Elfenland and Ticket to Ride, with a different twist on scoring.  I have recently obtained a copy and hope to play it more often---it's an enjoyable family game and people who like Ticket to Ride and Elfenland will most likely enjoy it, and it's different enough such that you can own all three games.

(Or all five games, if you have all three Ticket to Ride games, not counting the mini Mystery Train expansion).

I still wish for a Discworld theme, using the characters from [i]Going Postal[/i].  I can imagine it all the same.

Easy to learn game that is very enjoyable to play. If you make good use of the characters you can really make amazing quick progress. It is a bit luck depended but seems to balance out pretty well in the end. The subtle player interaction is in the races for the different bonustiles and in taking away cards your oponents need if you can afford to do so.

A very well-designed strategy game.  The diversity of the strategies make it quite enjoyable.  It is very light on the player interaction, but I don't mind that for my family.  The different routes to victory add a nice feel to the game, and will keep me coming back to learn more about this game.  The theme is not very deep, but the mechanics are sound without it.  I like how there are moments where you almost feel like you're playing a push-your-luck game as you take a risk without a playable city card, just hoping the right one will come up.

As I've played the game more I just keep getting more intrigued.  Every time it seems like the winner took a slightly different path.  Sometimes diversity is the key, and other times specialization works much better.  The scores are generally pretty close, which makes the endgame exciting.  My biggest complaint would probably be the tiebreaker.  It seems so arbitrary, and we've had at least 3 games end in a tie.  Aside from that this is a delightful game, that is just one step of complexity higher than another route building game...Ticket to Ride.

It seems to me that there is nothing new in this game--just a large group of tried and true mechanics such as set collection, path making, and area control, role selection, all pulled together.

The goals are pretty straight-forward, yet the board looks cluttered by mid-game.

A nice, innofensive, light game, rather in the mould of TTR with the set collection/route building thing going on. No blocking however, this is much more a race to be first to things.

*update* After a few plays, my initial strategy of being first to do all my routes does not seem as strong as it was. Still an OK game. Not the most exciting play in the world. I can see why this is a poster boy for those who dismiss euros as dull and lacking in theme. Probably a bit harsh but I can see why.

I played Thurn und Taxis a few times but, even though I feel it‚Äôs a well made game, it can hardly win me over: it‚Äôs just another eurogame leaving little to no room to interactions among players, offering no cues nor tolerance for chitchat and preventing anything that isn‚Äôt closely connected to the maniacal bookkeeping.

There‚Äôs no need in Thurn und Taxis for mirth and laughter indeed, for there‚Äôs no reason to indulge in such frivolous and useless activities: after all, in a boardgame what do you need the sociality for? Eurogames  teach us that silently winning on your own is what really matters and Thurn und Taxis backs this argument with conviction.

So many people love this game so much that I expected a little more from it. But it was fine, and I'd play it again. There are many route games I prefer. My main complaint is that it's mostly like 4-player solitaire. You try to get certain bonuses before other people, but you don't really have enough control to make a huge impact on their plans. The only tense part is at the very end, trying to determine if someone's going to end the game before you have a chance to score your current route; it can force you to score it before you really need to.

NOTE: I had a better impression the second time I played it, but I still can't figure out why it's as popular as it is. However, I might consider buying it if the price were right. I can think of a few situations in which something of this weight would come in handy.

I've played once as a 2 player game and quite enjoyed it.  However, I don't think it would be as good with 3 players and worse with 4.  Then again, I haven't tried it with more yet.

Update: I've now played it with 4 and had a good time.  The downtime was a little more than I would like and the six cards were usually completely different by the time it got around to me again. However, it makes you focus on getting stuff Bonus Tiles quickly and focusing on a few strategies rather than trying to get everything.  Upped my rating from a 7 to 7.5.

An interesting game with many routes to victory. i like the fact that there is little blocking as happens with Ticket to Ride (especially the original). People who despise the blocking can still enjoy the route building and point getting. if you're not familiar with gaming it may take a bit to pick up, but if you are decent at picking up game play it will pose no problem.
This may work with my in laws but is a bit on the upper end complexity wise for them.

RATING: 6
Easy rules & fast playing game of set collection.  Luck of the draw is high, making this a tactical game with some potential for strategic play (e.g. saving cards for a long route).  There is a race aspect to scoring points; the first person to fill a region gets X points, 2nd to fill region gets X-1, and so on.  The variety of options to score points should keep this game interesting for repeated plays; however, I think the points system is structured such that final scoring will be tight, and players will be forced to build routes in a manner that will get them the most carriage points.

Adapting the postal network which was built back in before 19th century by building as many branches in the cities across Bayern and its surroundings.Original story, Regensburg was the starting point for this Thurn und Taxis company, but in this game we start to find routes from any cities we want. Game will end untill the last branch has been built or the last 7th wagon has been obtained.

I feel I should like this game more than I do. I like train games, but this one just doesn't do it for me. Virtually no player interaction at all - just grabbing bonuses before others and taking cards they might want. Probably too much luck in it for me - getting the right card at the right time seems to be the best way to win and the game runs too long for its weight the downtime between turns can be bad if you're playing with 4, in the end I just wanted the game to end, which isn't a good sign. Glad I tried before I bought, certainly won't be rushing to get this one.

I like this game enough to play with others that want to play it.  I don't quite crave to play it when I am not around it though meaning that the game simply doesnt call out to me.

The components are nice and pretty.  I think one of the things that seems boringish about it is...that the game is designed to be so very tight point wise that i beleive ties coupld be commonplace and that there doesnt seem to be a real way to gainreal solid socring opportunites.

4p:  It has the feel of Ticket to Ride, without being all that similar.  The VP chits add significant tension, and there's usually several routes you could do that you must choose between.  I put this about 1 step up in complexity from TTR - enjoyable, relatively light fun with enough thinking to make it interesting.  
2p:  Much more strategic in nature, as you can plan for some cards, but only if you watch what your opponent is doing.  Overall, less fun, because there's more calculation, but it's also easier to get hosed by the random elements.

It's a little awkward getting used to the geography since I had no idea where anything was and couldn't even pronounce the town names correctly, but it was still really fun! The endgame is very tense too and can lead to some really small point gaps between players. Every point matters!

I knew from reading the rules this game would be simple, yet one of those few games interesting for both the gamer and non-gamer. First two plays confirmed my impressions. Has just enough choices to make it interesting, with only a draw and play per turn unless scoring, and only 4 special actions from which players can select each turn. The forced discard of route cards is forgiving, allowing for players to stay in the game if they don't find the right route cards. Does not feel like TtR to me - the only similarity is drafting cards but the route laying is completely different.

4/18/06 - 10+ games. Came with Die Macher order from Germany. Translated the rules - thankfully they were only 4 pages. This game played out very well and the couple I played with really liked it. Some are saying this game has no interaction - I somewhat disagree because using the Administrator could totally mess up your opponents plan if you see there could be some city cards they could use for their route. Some tension exists in this game when you are building a route but have no cards to add to it AND there are no useful cards showing in the expense. This is good game to have as part of your gaming fun and it probably is an easy enough game to get non-gamers to play. Simple enough ruleset but contains some interesting and sometimes tension filled choices - but not a brain burner.

Update: 5/7/06 - this game scales very well.

RATING: 7.5
Fast, simple route-building game, similar to Ticket to Ride but much more tactical. Because you don't get goal cards, and you don't really build an infrastructure of routes to build upon (apart from your post offices), the game seems really more about quick scoring rather than long-term goals. It's a fun, gateway-level game that scratches the same itch as TtR, so if you've played TtR to death, you'll probably like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ticket to ride type mechanics with a little bit of area control... except you're only racing against yourself.  There's a little intereaction between the players, but it's from taking rewards first.  I felt too much was put into the cards, and too little was put into the actual strategic play of the game.  There's an illusion of control to the game.  Good for families, bad for gamers.

Subtle family strategy game with a wide variety of well-balanced paths to victory -- almost [i]too[/i] wide a variety and [i]too[/i] well-balanced, to the point where the luck of the city card draw overwhelms the power of player choices. The most important choice seems to be when a player will decide to end the game, and there can be a minor kingmaking element if players are good at keeping track of points. Even so, I want to play it again. And again....

Sort of a "gamer's" version of Ticket to Ride or Elfenland. A route-building game with more texture and more subtley than these games, but it also is a little less accessible - lots of different, conflicting ways to score points means more confusion for the casual gamer. For reference, I'd play Ticket to Ride with my family, but Thurn und Taxis would probably be a tougher sell.

As a gamer, it's hard to give Thurn and Taxis a terribly low rating, because it's competantly put-together out of proven parts, and for me is a lot more appealing than Ticket to Ride. On the other hand, it's also hard to give it a high rating, for the same reasons: it's not so different from stuff we're already familiar with, the real player interaction is a little too sparse, there can be an aggravating lack of control, and the theme is weak. It's never going to compete with Beowulf, Blue Moon City, Settlers, or El Grande for raw fun factor because the other players in the game feel too distant.

Still, I liked Thurn and Taxis. But to be honest, I liked Rum and Pirates more, and Blue Moon City (against which it is up for the Spiel des Jahre) is the vastly cleaner, more interesting, more interactive, and more fun game.

Addenda: Thurn und Taxis won the Spiel des Jahre. A conservative, and ultimately rather disappointing pick. Blue Moon City was, to my mind, the unquestionably superior game. Blue Moon City will still be hitting the table in a couple years. Thurn und Taxis will not.

I'm not sure how I'd describe this one, but collecting sets of cards in order to first complete the different routes for the most points was a fun exercise.  A little tension as you race against the other players to complete specific tasks, but you're pretty much doing your own thing most of the time without worrying much about the other players.

A solid medium-weight game featuring many German design virtues. As it is clearly shooting for the family-oriented Spiel des Jahres award, the screwage/confrontational/player interaction element happens to be characteristically low, which gamers such as me will find somewhat lacking.

Player interaction is limited to the card management aspect, the race to acquire certain scoring tiles and the like. Unlike in say Zug um Zug you cannot block routes by first building them.

This has led me to devise following (4-player) variant, which seeks to increase player interaction and confrontation:

You may only build a house in a town already containing one, if posessing the 3 level coach. The same goes for towns containing two houses in respect to the 4 level coach and three houses in a town and the 5 level coach card. Note you may still have a route leading through such towns. Merely house/post station placement will be prevented unless you've reached the corresponding coach level.

I recommend a somewhat different scheme for less than four players.

In any case TuT is a thoroughly enjoyable medium-weight game with very atmospheric Biedermeier-style artwork. Together with the above-described variant rules, TuT may even be an 8 for me.

I'm most confident that it'll at least be nominated for the SdJ and might well even win the great prize (though I have to admit I'm not well acquainted with other likely candidates).

The only real interaction in this game is in the competition over cards and of acquiring point chits before the others. I guess I like a bit more in my games.

RATING: 5.8
So, shoot me, I don't think the new SDJ winner is all that great.  I told people I thought it was good, but that was based on BSW plays, a fitting format for this type of game.  Over the board, if you are not playing this game with two or maybe 3 fast players, this game is dreadfully boring and long, while lacking really all that much complexity.  For some reason, people think this game takes a whole lot of thought.  I maybe make 3-4 decisions a game that take a total of 90 seconds.  Nobody follows my lead.  People with any tendency toward AP will destroy this game.  

Furthermore, there isn't any confrontation to this tactical game.  Now, nobody will mistake me for someone who begs for confrontation in a game, but if you have a totally tactical game, for example, Hacienda, China, Hansa, Age of Steam, you will need non-screwage confrontation to keep the game from totally sucking ass.  Also, there is no balance for turn order.  If you are playing with 3-4 players, the person in the last seat gets jacked.  They are a turn behind to get bonus tiles.  Equalizing turns doesn't help, unless you have perfect timing.  You could end up having a last turn where you can do nothing at all.

When it comes to this game, you might as well be playing with yourself.  At least you won't be bored, nobody will get in your way, and you will be done in no time.

Blech. Andreas Seyfarth follows up Puerto Rico with this? As dry as Madonna. Very close to multi-player solitaire. You can mess with people's plans a little by taking cards you know they need, but it seems to hurt you as much as it hurts them. And the cards get wiped so often that you really are relying on luck to put the cards you need out there. I can't see playing this over the similar Ticket to Ride. At least it's short.

Reminds me of Ticket to Ride, but then again not really... You cannot block in this game which can be annoying when you don't want other people to succeed in their plans! Only thing you can do is grab the tickets they want, but that's not always the best move. I like how the scoring works when you must decide if you want your houses in all of one region or one house in each region. The various bonus chips and the 4 special roles you can choose each round just add more to a fine, lightweight game which scales well for 2-4 players.

Reminiscent of Web of Power and Ticket to Ride. Works well enough but nothing about the gameplay had me thinking that I was setting up a postal route. The theme is veneer thin and interaction is minimal. Also there is nothing to do whilst waiting for your turn as the cards will probably be cleared out by the time it comes round to you.

Seemed a little boring with very simple mechanics. It reminded me of a less inviting Ticket to Ride, and I along with the family, like Ticket to Ride better. There is some decision making as to what action to take and routes to acquire. It seems to me it can get very repetitive. I would much rather use Ticket to Ride as my family game night game because of its theme and colors used, it's more inviting.

I like this game.  It is a well done set-collection type of game similar in some ways to [gameid=9209].  A decent amount of depth and strategy, with only of touch of opponent "screwage" if you can take a card that you know someone else needs.  Overall, a well done game, and worthy of its Spiel des Jahres award.

Oh, and don't be fooled by the theme - or what is in actuality a pretensious attempt at one.  This game could be played with a blank board with lines between lettered boxes, and a collection of blank cards with nothing but those self-same letters, and it would be exactly the same.  The theme does not make this game what it is.  That alone makes it clearly a Euro in the strongest sense.  If [gameid=181] and [gameid=103] are your favorite games, this is probably NOT for you.  If you like [gameid=9209] or other set-collection type games, then this will do quite fine.  This game single-handedly defines "Multiplayer Solitaire".  Despite all of that, however, it is still a very fun game.

I really like this one.  I just thought it was fun and interesting.  It's true that it's a cross between Ticket to Ride (really even the Marklin edition) and Web of Power.  It packs a punch for the time it takes to play (45 minutes).  There's lots of tension between trying to finish off routes fast to get tiles you want, but then also finishing them off slowly to get points for longer routes.  You have to hustle to keep up with the impending game's end.  The game is not too hard to end, so you have to watch out.  Very fun.  Plays reasonably well 2-4, maybe best with 3.  One tiny gripe: you put your houses on the cities and then you can't read the names of them so well, but no big deal.

Let me start by saying that I really dislike Ticket to Ride. Now this game is nothing like that other game, but it often gets compared to it.

Now, I really like this game. Instead of just building routes and blocking, you have many more options on where to build your post offices on the route. You then compete over resources that vary based on those decisions. 

To me this is a much deeper game than Ticket to Ride, and quite enjoyable. 

This is still rather new to me, so my opinion might change after a few plays.

Am I rating this too high too quickly?  It's not the greatest game I've played, but it certainly has a relaxed feel and there is sufficient amount to think about.  It seems to me like the game Ticket to Ride should have been -- the objectives are similar but it's less repetitive and there is a bit more strategizing and optimizing to do.  It also feels more enjoyable and less tense.  Could move down if it gets old, but so far I'm enjoying it a lot.

I've got no problem with the theme. I find it kind of cute.  The board is beautiful, and reminded me of Hansa....maybe the color scheme. The card-drafting has been used multiple places before, most well-known is probably Ticket to Ride. The comparisons are unavoidable. 

While the "role selection" is a fun piece to consider each turn, and helps with card management.....it left me wanting more. The biggest criticism with the game is the limited player interaction. That doesn't bother me a whole lot, because its still there. The diminishing points values for items that are being contested seems like a pretty direct interaction, but maybe its less obvious where that occurs to some players. But I kind of wanted the role selection to impact each player more. 

Overall, Thurn und Taxis was a bit on the dry side (not a negative to me), visually appealing, with nice decisions to make. Its short enough that the weaknesses aren't an issue. There are plenty of other games that provide a similar feel to this one, but I like it better than Ticket to Ride...for the obvious comparison. I fear the theme will keep it generally behind TtR in the public perception, though.

Not too shabby.  This one I probably have a bit too high - it's awfully dependent on the available cards.  Still, the scoring opportunities help to offset poor turns of luck.  And the game is pretty quick, so suffering an unlucky turn of fate won't make you feel too put out.

Uhh...it's better than Ticket to Ride, but that's like saying poop is better than crap as far as I'm concerned.  Seriously folks, most of us have played Ticket To Ride and Web of Power so why is this the "hot" game of the minute?  There is literally NOTHING in this game that either of those games doesn't provide in terms of (_extremely_ limited) decision making, route planning, card drafting, set collecting, and area control.  I _never_ go into a game expecting something completely, brilliantly original- in fact, I think building on established game concepts and design ideas is healthy and interesting- but this game is arguably even less original than last year's Vegas Showdown.  I really expected more from Mr. Seyfarth, and his only contribution to the T2R/Web of Power chassis is a variation on the role selection thing that we've already seen of course in Puerto Rico.  TuT represents a phase that I think the Euro design paradigm is going through right now where it's completely stagnant and it's cannibalizing itself, cranking out games that are fundamentally the same 3 or 4 archetypes over and over again to appease this core audience of gamers that will still buy anything with wooden pieces or a Hans Im Gluck logo on it.  As far as the themeing goes, here's an anecdote.  Another player failed to complete a route toward the end of the game and someone said "I guess the mail didn't get through".  I came to a realization at that point that not once during the game did the thought of planning a postal route, establishing offices, or any of that even enter my mind.  I was thinking about cards, pieces, and a board as well as exploiting the system to the best possible effect.  The whole thing could literally have been plain white cards with plain, black font city names played on a plain, white board with plain, black font and it literally wouldn't have made a difference to me.  In fact, I think it would have been more honest than wrapping up a completely generic, hackneyed game in a beautifully illustrated package with a mail delivery theme.  Maybe I'm spoiled by "Snakes on a Plane", which tells you up front what it is without any folderol.  Does the game work?  Of course it does, mechanically it's like an oiled machine- why shouldn't it be?   There is some weirdness in regards to the scoring- I was losing the whole game and wound up literally blowing everyone away with a single route in the very last turn of the game that netted me twice the points I had going into it.  But hey, what do I know...I'm a heretic, a hater, and all those other things that people have called me for trashing the currently popular Eurogames.

An almost pure luck game, there's no possible strategy beyond the cards in table. The starting player gets too much point advantage.
And I deeply dislike the graphic design and the distribution of objects on the board :-)

Got in Trade (along with Battle Cry and Heimlich & Co.) for Looting London, Modern Art Card Game, Jambo and Leonardo DaVinci.
Fun route building game that's a step-up in strategy over Ticket to Ride.  First play with two player.  Seems like it would be fun with more.
After 3 plays of this, I have to say that's probably enough.  This was fun, but not challenging at all.  I like the concept, but repeated plays offered nothing new and exhausted its replay value.  Too light and too easy!  I still like Ticket To Ride much better.

RATING: 5
Thurn und Taxis I played twice to date. Once was during Spiel 2006, when it had just been crowned as SdJ-winner. My girlfriend wanted to play this game (she wants to test most SdJ-winners), and so we sat down, and wondered about an hour later where the appeal lay. Direct interaction is fairly low, it all seemed a matter of grabbing points, so... what?

Forward to the second time I played. I entered the game with an open mind as I would be playing a family member's copy he had shown us very proudly, and I didn't want to ruin the good mood‚Äîin addition, it [i]had[/i] been a long time, and maybe my view on matters had changed. And indeed it had. The interaction is rather subtle in this game: there is pressure to not get stuck with too many malus points in the form of unbuilt houses, and once most larger bonuses have been taken the race is on for the remainder. Viewed like that TuT was definitely better than I remembered. However, the game suffers from a few serious buts. There is, of course, the luck of the draw. The game is not particularly keen on players hoarding cards as you must discard down to three upon completing a route. This makes matters more ad hoc than I like. Second is that near the end the game begins to drag; most options are closed, players are looking for very specific cards, and matters turn into a boring race. Third is that the current ruleset does not really allow for a larger difference in the amount of cards drawn and played. You must draw one and play one, augmented by either drawing or playing an extra. The average net effect cancels out the extras, once again strengthening the luck of the draw.

All in all I think the game is better than I remembered, but not by much. It is very unfortunate the fluid feeling of the first few rounds appears to be unmaintainable, otherwise I'd probably like the game even more. With the current ruleset I get the feeling that the players are not really allowed a lot of strategical space to explore, and that is, I think, a bit of a shame. Still, I'm increasing the rating, the old note was too harsh.

Lots of options with both choice of cards to create routes and trying to optimise the assistance from the postal workers make it a fascinating game to play.

2006-11: after three plays - one with two and twice with four player, I definitely like this game.  After the first game however, my brain was still stuck trying to make the disconnect between this and TtR.  Now that I am over that, I can enjoy TaT.  The only negative with the game is that there isn't a huge amount of player interaction.  It's a bit like everyone is each playing solitaire.  Also, do think the rules could stand some improvement.  Still, I look forward to playing this again.

This is a perennial favorite at our house.  It's a good next step for those that love Ticket to Ride, like we do.  A beautiful game board and cards.  The game offers many ways to get to a win, which means gives this good replayability.  But I will get a bit tired of it if I play it too often, so this hits the table just once in awhile.

Good light-medium weight game. Similar in feel to Ticket to Ride, but i like it better because there are more choices to think about each turn.  The only down side is not very much player interaction, but it does make for a friendlier game, since you can't screw people over like in TtR. Deserving of the SDJ, IMHO. Admittedly not an original game concept, but a fun light game.
UPDATE - After a few more plays, I have to lower my rating to 6.  I still like the idea of the game, but really wish there was more player interaction.  I honestly never pay any attention to what anyone else is doing.  The only time that anyone's actions ever affected me was when someone ended the game before I could finish my last route.

A similar premise to Ticket to Ride, yet different enough to feel like a completely different game.

I was drawn to this game since the first play. It doesn't really simulate postal service, but you can relate it to some extent. What I like about this game is scattered VP all over the board, giving the player some sense of purpose. And while it's card driven, if you play it smartly, you could minimize the luck. At first I thought it's multiplayer solitaire game, since it's about racing. But the more experience you play, the more you could jerk the player after you. Wonderful.

I read that one of the drawbacks to the game was a lack of player interaction, but I didn't see it as such. Just because you are not doing something directly to your opponent doesn't mean that his choices do not affect yours (and vice versa); and part of an effective strategy can be to keep your opponent in check (denying a card or grabbing a scoring marker that he was aiming for). So where is the lack of interactrion?

I also see randomness in the cards as being offset by having six cards to choose from, drawing blind, or resetting the available cards. This, along with good hand management and a little forethought, practically negates the randomness factor. 

With those two complaints put to rest after only one play, the game as a whole was solid and thoughtful, though lacking an interesting theme for me.

A more interesting game using the same basic idea as Web of Power but adding more to it. This is very much a euro, but there is some direct competition and things change as the game goes on--two things I like in a game. Each time I've played it I've been mildly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.

Players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways.
Players build postal routes from city to city to city so that each city is adjacent to the next city on the route and there is a road connecting these two cities. Each route must consist of at least three cities. Players may only build one route at a time. Routes are represented by melded city cards arranged in the order of the route. Three expansions: Der Kurier der F√ºrstin (in Spielbox 2006), Power and Glory (2007), and All Roads Lead to Rome (2008). Some say this is a TICKET TO RIDE killer.

This game is fantastic to look at, the board, the pieces, are all top notch.  I've played one solo game just to check it out and will be taking it to my FLGS tomorrow to play with opponents so my ratings might go up or down.  The cards in this game get handled alot so as "Board games with Scott" says they probably won't last long, could've been made better.

Fun card-based game of building postal routes.  Beautiful bits and board!  There's no route blocking as there is in Ticket to Ride, but there is player interaction by choosing cards your opponent will want--or discarding them altogether!  Fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Very little opportunity for players to delay with analysis paralysis, so the game moves along nicely.

I really do enjoy this game, although my opponents usually end up getting a huge swoop in points during the later steps of the game to overwhelm me. This is an ingenious postal carrier game with very light shades of ticket to ride in which you build consecutive tracks in between cities. Cards are also chosen from a pool similar to TTR, but that's about where the similarities end. Very fun game for 2 players as well as four. Beware of the fiends who horde Innsbrook though....

A nice, easy, simple family game and a great introduction to "modern" board gaming that's accessible to all.

Visually gorgeous and an engaging mechanic. The trade off between short routes for efficient scoring and longer routes for coaches and bonuses and the luck-pushing element involved in the potential loss of incomplete routes always keep me interested.

Also a perfect game for playing with a partner, as it is competitive without being combative.

A fast moving (family) game, featuring hand management, card drafting, and some "tile" placement (which conveys almost all the victory points).
A good blend of several well known mechanics, providing a result which is definitely better than the single parts. Decision are taken mainly at tactical level (expecially with 3  players)
Very low player interaction, scales well with the number of players.

Good game here. It has a short set of rules that is relatively quick to learn and to teach (I say "relatively", because I did look up a couple rules questions that had already been asked and answered on The Geek). Players must create routes to build a postal system by playing city cards that are drawn at the beginning of the their turn (and/or from their hand). Card routes are layed out on the table in a horizontal line and cards for adjacent cities can be placed on either end of the line. When the player has at least three cards in a route, they can opt to "cash in" the route or keep it on the table to be further expanded in the coming turns (only one route per player is allowed on the table at a time). When a route is cashed in, the player can place post offices either in every city in one region or one city in each different region that the route moves through. The player can score victory point tiles for having post offices in all cities in a region (or all cities in pre-specified regional pairs) and if the player has presence in all regions (save the largest) this also nets a point tile. If the player's route included 5 or more cities, they pick up a route length VP tile. "Carriage Cards" are also available for route sizes 3-7 and they provide VPs when obtained. These Carriage Cards must be obtained in tiered steps (i.e.- the player cannot get the "7" length card before getting the "6"). There are four different Postal Officials, each with a different power that can help the player out, but only one can be utilized per turn. Most of the postal duties help with hand management, but the Cartwright worker lets the player grab a higher tiered Carriage card than the route warrants. All of this makes for a fun and light-hearted game. There aren't really that many excrutiating decisions to be made and I think most eurogame buffs would be more than willing to give this game a try. It's not a "postal Ticket to Ride", but I do feel that TtR fans would probably also like this game. I absolutely love the period feel provided by Michael Menzel's beautiful artwork and the historical overview provided. Thurn and Taxis won the 2006 Spiel des Jahres award and I think it was a well-deserved win. Recommended!

RATING: 7
Hand management game with zip player interaction. The hand management is fun and thoughtful, but we've seen it before.

Also depressingly tactical in that, apart from planning an extended route and hoping you get the cards, you can't count on much forward strategy. The cards you see now will almost certainly be gone by the time its your turn. And anyway, you can always sweep them all away yourself.

Enjoyable enough, but hasn't really grabbed me. I think its because we've seen it all before and the special abilities seem to soften the hash edge of other card drafting games rather than add depth. eg, compare being able to draw extra cards or play extra cards (and you do both!) compared to TtR's "you can only draft OR play". Or the angst when a TtR extra locomotive comes up and resets the draft options just when the card you wanted comes up where in T&T you can CHOOSE when to sweep or not. It all becomes too easy, relaxed and lacks tension and excitement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
True, player interaction is minimal: basically, you pay attention to which bonus chits your opponents have taken or are about to take and to whether someone is about to trigger the end game. If you're not careful, an opponent's card flush could hurt you as well. But that's enough interaction for me. The most common comparison is to Ticket to Ride, but the game reminds me more of Elfenland in the need to have the right card for each path and to visit all or nearly all of the cities.

This is the good version of Ticket to Ride. Properly fixes card hoarding and long-route runs that fundamentally break Ticket to Ride. Still falls short on a really immersive theme, and while I don't believe the ability to claim routes in Ticket to Ride is an actual competitive mechanic, this game still doesn't have routes perfect (nobody should end a route early to gain the +1 advantage in tile scoring at the cost of being an entire carriage-length behind). Still, if you want a game with average luck but lots of critical decision making, this is pretty good.

Initially the game seems somewhat peaceful; little interaction, but when you realize that you have to win the game, maybe looking at your opponent's routes would be convenient for you can do some damage to it if you take out the correct city cards from the display or flushing them can make your opponent wait a while until the city he needs appears.

Reminds me of Ticket to Ride but w/a bit more control.  You are drawing cards, collecting a set of adjoining cities.  Several cities comprise regions and you score victory points for being one of the first couple of players to claim all cities in a region.  This game does a good job and has a very clean/simple mechanics...but the game itself is too dry to ever rate higher.  Maybe 7 is a bit high, but I'm liking it after 2 plays, and I'd usually be willing to play.

Yep, 7 is too high.  Dropping down to a 6.  The game is just so dad-gum dry, I can't get excited about playing it.  I don't mind playing it, but the theme is lacking.

Players are founding postal routes around Barvaria, and it's neighbouring provinces.  Players on their turn draft a city card, then build a city card into their current route.  They can optionally close and score a route, which perhaps qualifies them for various victory points sprinkled around the board.  A solid Alan-Moon like drafting/route planning game, beautifully presented, and typically developed to a knife edge by Hans im Glueck.  The look and feel of the game play may just get me past the fact we've seen it all before, several times over.  Recommended.

A game based on the origins of the postal system in Europe.  Players try to build postal routes that span the different regions of 17th century Bavaria.  Points are awarded for length of route, for covering all cities in a region, or for establishing routes across all regions.

This game came highly recommended to me and has won some prestigious rewards, so I put it on my Christmas wish list.  One of the selling points to me was the different theme from any of the games I already owned.  Once I got the game I was a little disappointed.  The mail rout theme was fresh, but the game play was mediocre.  The game simply did not get my brain working very hard.  The decisions of what cards to pick up are rarely challenging, and you often have a pretty good idea of what mail routes your opponents are working on.  The competition is quite indirect, which suits some, but not me.  Its not a bad game, but I would much rather play something more engaging.

I recently auctioned this item off in the Jack Vassel auction.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the whole Vassel family.  I'm happy to have been able to help out in a small way by donating this game.

Nearly as good for two people as for three or four (which is rare).  Beautiful design.

RATING: 7
An interesting game. Everyone's capsule summary of "it's a gamer's Ticket to Ride" is pretty much spot on. However, I think that Thurn and Taxis plays a little more cleanly, since it's easier to make routes instead of trying for that say, seventh orange card you need in TTR.

I also like the different ways to get victory points instead of the route cards in TTR -- I always feel like the game in TTR is always determined by that first handing out of the route cards and everything in the game is foreordained.

Not for two players -- four is best.

I didn't do particularly well when I played the first time, and am sure I'd do better on the next...
It's a good game, but I think it takes a couple rounds to see it whole.  I like the diminishing values for completing strings/routes.  I like the special moves (although the board could be clearer that "take two cards" or "place two cards" is the total and not additional to the standard draw one card...

I look forward to playing it again.

Well, I can certainly see why people compare this game to Ticket to Ride in that your objective is to plan a route and collect cards to play your route and earn victory points.  People who like a more confrontational game would probably prefer Ticket to Ride whereas T&T maybe be considered a bit more multi-player solitaire when compared to TtR.  The reason I prefer T&T is that there are multiple ways to end the game (one of which you have a lot of contol over), and in T&T I feel like I'm doing something every turn, whereas in TtR there are many turns I'm just going to be picking up train cards.

Received in trade; excellent condition.

Initial 3-player game.  Very slow going as my opponents were double and triple checking rules and possibilities.

I found it a bit slow and long for what it is.  I'll withhold rating until we get in another game where we all know what we are doing a bit better.

Both my husband and daughter liked it A LOT!!  Good news for me--at least they will replay it without too many threats or pleadings.

Interesting, not bad and definitely MUCH better than TTR.

2nd play 11-13-11.  Wow!! 2-player game with my husband and we were both a bit rusty after only playing it once a long time ago.  We both enjoyed it and plan to play again.

Played again in 2015.  End game is mind-numbingly painful and boring.

Gifted to another BGG user on 9-12-15.

A really good network-building game. Gameplay is similar to Ticket to Ride, however unlike Ticket to Ride, players cannot block routes from each other. The goal of Thurns and Taxis however is not to make singular routes, but rather to try to cover as much of the board as quickly as possible. Players can pick up victory points in lots of different ways, depending on what strategies and priorities they make for themselves. My favorite aspect of this game is that there is no single strategy that will guarantee victory, as players will inherent lose points from certain goals as the pick up points for gaining other goals.

RATING: 5
It's simliar to Ticket to Ride, but I like TtR better. Thurn & Taxis has a bit more tactical depth and more ways to score, but you can't screw your opponents directly, and there can be some massive point swings at the end of the game that can result in somewhat strange and unsatisfactory endings.

There's some similarity to Ticket to Ride. It's about connecting routes. The other similarity that struck me was that you get minus points for "things incomplete". However, competition is very indirect - not many ways to affect your opponents, so player interaction is quite low. Because of that, I find the game lacks enough tension to make it a real draw for me. Ticket to Ride works because it's seen as a gateway game. T&T is seen as a gamer's game, so you expect more but then are disappointed when you don't get it.

My group and I have a soft spot for this game. With experienced players, getting the cards you want becomes much harder. Lodz usually gets taken even if a player is not working that route at the moment. The challenge is in managing what you need to do without ever having to spend your bonus moves flushing the tableau. When nobody is taking one for the team and refreshing the cards, it's a tense race with a bit of brinksmanship. While waiting for cards to add to your carriage is tempting, you may be better cutting this route short and starting a new route with the cards you've built up.

Often compared to Ticket to Ride, this game is very enjoyable, though perhaps not quite so enjoyable as the other. You do not compete to place routes, but to claim goals for servicing certain combinations of cities, which can be claimed only by having the right cards, much like Big City or Acquire. Fortunately there is more than one card for each city so it's not quite as cutthroat as it would be otherwise.

Thurn and Taxis is a simple, basic worker-placement, route-creating game about building a postal empire in old Bavaria. It offers little new to the genre, but still remains a really solid game. What I really like about it is that it is simple and easy to play, while still providing enough subtle strategy options to keep it interesting. What you have here is an A+ gateway game to Eurogames for beginners that won't bore the expert to death. Nice.

(2-4 players) I'm warming up to this game.  Kinda like China meets Ticket to Ride meets Puerto Rico.

Similar to Ticket To Ride and K&K/China.  There are many ways to score, but while it may be a little "deeper" than its predecesors I don't think it makes it a better game.

I find that Thurn & Taxis has less interaction and tension (except the last couple rounds), and  I also think Blue Moon City was more deserving of the SdJ 2006 award.  The game feels too "passive" but still entertaining overall. Grade: B-

Played 1 time with 4 players. And 4 players may be the reason I am only giving this a '7'. Too much downtime. This game reminds me a lot of Web of Power, but I found that Thurn and Taxis was more interested, with both more to do and to consider. But the extra heft to gameplay made turns take longer than they ought. Can your group REALLY not overthink things and make decisions quickly? Then you will probably enjoy this great little game. But I could see how this game could bog down -- after all, my first game of it clocked in at 2 hours. That was about 45 minutes too long. Still, neat scoring mechanics, but simple rules, with lots of tough decisions and a good smattering of luck, made for an enjoyable game. I look forward to more playings.

I think it's unfair to compare this game to Ticket to Ride.  There is no player competition for routes and your routes don't connect.  It's a game about getting your houses on the board in as efficient a way as possible (they are negative points if not placed at game end).  You build city routes as a means of delivering the houses to the board, and your choice of routes lets you 'aim' their placement.  Beyond that you can create strategies to pick up lots of bonus tiles, speed up the game timer, or react to other players strategies.  The game is full of options.  It's very easy to get to the table and both my family and my gaming group are into it.  It's a good two player game as well.  Our first play was slow as we were learning the map but after that it speeds up quite a bit.  This game fits in my favorite slot of under and hour playing time and medium weight.

Great Ticket to Ride type game. I love that this game has more ways to manipulate the card draw than TtR. The game plays faster and you are more involved in what the other players are doing.

[Set collection, route connection] [4P:3,3P:4,2P:3] Wow. I heard that T&T was light. I didn't think it was this light. No real hard decisions, extremely tactical due to the Atlantic Star-like card display that players draft from, and zero (and I do mean zero) interaction. You don't even have to look at what the other players are doing. Completely inoffensive, and totally unmemorable. ***UPDATE: Tremendously boring. I'm completely done with T&T for good. PRERELEASE COMMENTS:On radar. I hope it's at least as complex as PR. *** UPDATE: Urk. Ticket to Ride meets Web of Power? That's two games that I'm not fond of. Dropped from wishlist.

Thurn and Taxis is yet another set collection card game for 2 to 4 players whose theme (German postal service?) is completely detached from its mechanics.

The game itself does have depth and requires a certain degree of skill, as the luck of the draw is mitigated well by the board (which contains 6 face up cards) and the postmaster (that allows you to draw two cards).
I actually find it enjoyable. My problem with it is that there are already so many set collection card games with a pasted up theme. For me these games really don't feel that great without a good and possibly well integrated theme. If I weren't winning so much, I think I'd play [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/71836/onirim]Onirim[/url] over this.

After ten years of playing Euros, I finally played this title for the first time, and it was a pleasant surprise.  It's the kind of game that would be produced if China and Ticket to Ride had a baby.  There's some interesting, albeit somewhat luck-influenced route-planning and building, along with some tense area majority strategy to deal with.  Knowing where each city is on the board is critical, and I wish it was easier to identify where on the map the city on each card is (it's just words and shared colors as printed), but it's not a hard game to learn if it's explained right.

Buen juego, sencillo y muy bonito. Mala primera experiencia a causa del desconocimiento de las reglas y lo intensa que se puso Reyes. Quiz√°s a 4 se ralentiza mucho el juego.
Actualizaci√≥n 5¬™ partida: las sensaciones han ido mejorando a medida que le echamos m√°s partidas y se va consolidando como uno de nuestros familiares favoritos. Muy agradable de jugar y con decisiones chulas, funciona mucho mejor a 2 o a 3. A 4 se hace pesado.

Very nifty game!  The rules seem tricky, at first, but once you dive in, you see its simple elegance.  Build a route, claim some cities (either all in one province on your route, or one city in each), and get points.  Points are earned for collecting groups of cities, as well as for long routes.  Artwork, bits, and gameplay are all terrific.

Easy to understand. Short turns. Many different tactics which can be switched almost anytime during the game to adjust to different situations. You rarely, if ever, really get stuck / left behind or are in a very comforting leading position - you must be careful not to get beaten in the last turn, which makes the game exciting.

Seems like a solid card collection game, not unlike Ticket to Ride but in a more "gamer" fashion. There is a little bit of risk management as you may end up unable to extend a road. The good strategy doesn't appear to be straightforward for the moment. (Bumped the rating to a 9, will not reach 10 for lack of interaction, but a great game anyway!)

Light card drafting and set collection game where timing is pretty important. If you can score before your peers do that'll be an advantage.

PRO - Solid game.  I like the flexibility in how you place houses along a route. Call me crazy but I like the theme even though it doesn't come into play during the game.

CON - Somewhat simplistic. I wish there were some way to mark your route on the map as you build it. You're constantly retracing the route mentally when it's your turn.  Also, in Ticket to Ride I can read the map upside down easily.  Not so much with this game.  :D

Ok as a two player game, would think it would be even better with 3 or 4.  Just finding the time is the difficulty (29/12/10 - rating 7).  UPDATE:  Final played a three player game, and it was so much better than two player.  Rating increase to 8 (based on 3 player game) (15/1/11). UPDATE: Still enjoy; a good solid opening game to a full day (23/10/11). UPDATE: This is a recommended game.  I am yet to play it with 4, not a fan for the two player, but as an entree game to a three player extended gaming session, it is hard to beat (24/11/12). UPDATE: I just really like this game, despite that I keep forgetting that the 7 carriage card is actually worth 10 points (I always fall for this trap).¬† For maximum enjoyment, don't study the board until It's your turn (Rating 8.324, Jan 17)

The theme is quite terrible - typical Euro and so it's a little fun to hate the theme - but egads! There is no way to interest someone in this game through theme-first tactics. It has a TtR feel as everyone says, but I like this one slightly more than TtR. More thought into your moves and less screwage on your opponents is what a relatively simple route collection should be. At the end of the day, there's lots of solid planning that has to be done to win, but T&T gets a bit boring if it goes on too long as it is a rather routine game. Take card, play card, score. At least players don't mull over their moves for too long in TtR; in T&T there's a bit of wait time while people plan. In a multiplayer solitaire sorta game, this can be a bit of a killjoy.

Very interesting...fortunately, not much like Ticket To Ride, which is what I feared originally.  It's similar, with some rummy-style play, but more difficult to finish routes. 

I wish there was a little more interaction, but I still definitely enjoy it more than TtR.  There seem to be multiple paths to victory, although I think going for the minimum number of cities to force the end is the key.  Turn order also seems to be important.  Going first is definitely an advantage.

I liked this more than I thought I would - it has those "little victories", where you get to make a clever move & feel good about yourself, even if you lose the game. Still, it has multi-player solitaire tendencies, and the penalty of losing a route prevents players from getting too serious about "messing" with each other.

I liked this one very much when we first played it in 2006. It seemed to me that it was some kind of TTR with more control in it and I tought it deserved its SdJ. After a few plays, I still think T&T is a decent clever family game but there are so many superior games around that it will only hit the gaming table on a few occasions. The Glanz & Gloria extension is fine as an extension (new map, new routes) but you had better play according to the 'regular" T&T rule and ignore the "horses" rule : it makes the game worthless IMO.

A solid enjoyable route-planning game.  Easy to learn and teach, my 8 and 10 year olds had no trouble grasping it, but surpringly subtle in play, with plenty to think about - you have to watch what others are doing - esp the quick game-finishing possible once someone has the 6 coach down.  Reminds me of Kardinal & Konig/Web of Power in play, weight and theme, with a spicing of the card collecting of Ticket to Ride.

It surprises me that this won the SdJ, and not because it's a bad game or anything.  I like the game just fine.  The rules take a little getting used to, and the game is a little heavier than recent SdJ winners.  It will be interesting to see how this game goes over with more casual gamers over time.  The artwork is nice and I like the overall play of the game.  I look forward to trying it again.  The theme isn't exactly inspiring.Update: Enjoyed playing this again recently, although I question how it will stand up to repeated plays.

RATING: 4
The more I play this the less I think of it.  It is most certainly very luck-dependent as you can get completely screwed by the cards available to you.  If you have to flush the field more than once in your game, you are probably behind the curve and it will be difficult to win.  And if you have to trash one of your routes before scoring, it's over for you.

But that's not the problem; I like lots of games that are very luck-dependent.  Thurn & Taxis' problem is that it doesn't have anything else going for it.  The feel of the gameplay is of a serious, thoughtful game, but it doesn't have the strategy to hold your interest.  There's no tension of the kind that makes Ticket to Ride so great.  And there's no player interaction because what you do rarely affects other players (yes, I know card-drawing affects other players, but come on, that's piddly).  Nor is there any excitement like there is in Beowulf's risks and showdowns.  

So now you've got a game that feels like a serious game (no excitement, no tension, no interaction) but is actually very luck-dependent.  That's a real loser combination.

Unfortunately, this game was a pretty big let down. Only having played it once, it was a little bit bland and boring. Having said that, the person I was playing with wasn't quite focused at all which caused a LOT of downtime. I would definitely give this game another try, possibly with more people, and I have a feeling my score would go up to at least a 7. More thoughts on this one after more plays.

In comparison with Ticket to Ride...
I prefer this game much more. There appears to be a lot more strategy and interesting mechanics. Could easily work as a gateway since there is nothing too complicated, but not nearly as simple as TtR.

One of my favourite medium light games. The game that I feel quite well - in other words usually I qain quite a reasonable quantity of points. It plays about an hour, the rules are simple, nevertheless its has its depth and allows different tactics and some level of strategy. Sheer fun! However, because of its abstract mechanics some people don't like it too much. My wife, for example.

An intriguing little game, Thurn and Taxis encourages you to gather points while making it nearly impossible to do so.  Frequently you can spend all your efforts just trying to obtain one point bonus (it's all about the bonuses) just to find that someone else gets the bonus you were after and an extra one with apparently little effort.  While it's a fun game to try, it can be frustrating, when other people pick up the only cards you need, sometimes deliberately.  It is a tactical game, after all.  It's short (around 60-90 minutes, maximum).  Watch out for people who make frequent use of the carriage house dude.  It's a great way to gain bonuses quickly and finish the game earlier than when other people may be ready for it to end.  All in all, a good game.

Only ever played on Yucata.de and I like the online implementation so well I think it might feel a little fiddly playing the real thing. 
It's a simple enough game: take cards, build routes, close routes, put offices down, and score routes. And yet, this is a game where literally every single decision you make has to be so carefully considered. At the moment, I am 0 for 18 games. Can't seem to edge out a win and it's slowly driving me mad. 
Princess Messenger is my favorite of the expansions as the base game is more or less the same but with a bit more flexibility.

One of the most beautiful games I own. This has worked well with non-gamers, who are impressed with a game with a pretty board that uses no dice and is amazingly simple. I have enjoyed the game from 2-4 players, with each end of the spectrum having some benefits and some drawbacks.

Although it does not get much mention as one, I find that I turn to TandT over and over when choosing a new gamer's first 'Eurogame' experience. It usually works very well. Great family game also.

RATING: 7
A really good game (have not played it enought though). This is a quite light game with few decisions, but the multiple scorings with more adaptive decisions makes this a better game than TtR.

Update: The lack of conflict in this game is making me a bit tired of this game. While I am not against it per se, when playing it, people tend to be quiet and only thinking. I am more of a social gamer than that.

T&T is the perfect game for testing whether someone truly has the Euro gamer mindset. Games are almost always going to be really close, so good gameplay requires careful calculation of which slightly higher chips you can get, exactly how many turns each player needs, etc. A lot of people must find it unthematic and boring; I find it perfect.

RATING: 7.5
There are some addictive elements (can't quite define it) that help explain its popularity. There's also something counter-intuitive about this game, and in this case, for me as a gamer, that's a good thing, because it makes the game feel somewhat "original" despite the fact that there is so much (if not everything) that's familiar. Another way of describing it is to say that it's quite a light game, but I am not sure it would be the best to introduce to non-gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another great game, easy to learn.  The Board is very colourful, great "bits"  Cards are very nice.  I would say this is a medium strategy game.  There is also the opportunity to screw over the player to the left of you.  

I would say this game contains just enough luck to keep it interesting for replay-ability.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
My experience might have been marred by my less than enthusiastic opponents, but for now this seems too much like a less interesting version of TtR. Then again, I still want to like it, and I could see the game growing on me. I'll probably have to find some different opponents, though.

Thought this looked a bit dull and a bit too similar to Ticket to Ride at first glance. However we were pleasantly surprised by this game. (It did win SDJ). It plays great as a 2 player, the components are nice although the colour scheme is a bit drab, but it does tie in more accurately with the historic theme of the game. All-in-all a very enjoyable gaming experience.

Almost a 9 for me, but I don't do fractions and I don't think it will can sustain a higher rating once my initial excitement has worn off (which it still hasn't after 12 games or so). Nothing new and nothing spectatular, but one of those really rare games where everything fits together that you cannot find any flaws. I love everything about this game: the looks, the components, the rules, the theme. Probably my favorite "area control/placement/chain building" game.

It's a good game.  I didn't see it at first, but there's a strong aspect of needing to make the absolute most of each turn in order to do well, like Princes of Florence.  But, unlike Princes of Florence, your choices are pretty constricted, though at least that keeps things flowing.  It's definitely a "network" game, in the vein of a railroad game, but it plays a bit differently than other things I've tried.

Played 2-player. This offers some interesting choices, but only on a light level. I found it somewhat boring. I'm eager to give it a try with more people, as I think that will improve the experience, but I think the game itself will still not do much for me. *UPDATE* Played 4-player. I see the appeal of the game, but it just isn't for me. There's too much luck involved in the draw of the cards, and there's absolutely nothing to do when it isn't your turn. Even when it's your turn, the decisions are trivial. Bleh.

An enjoyable game of connecting postal routes in Germany. Shares a similar mechanic to Ticket to Ride in that players choose cards to pick up from a face up selection.
There isn't very much player interaction in the game except for the card selection (where it's possible to screw another player by taking a card they want, etc.) but that does mean that the game works just as well with 2 as with 4.
A good game in my eyes as it's not too complex, not too long and yet there is some depth to it.

Edit: Decent game but just doesn't excite me enough to want to play it that often compared to many others out at the moment.

This feels to me like TtR Marklin, but taken to the next level.  It is pretty fast moving with a plethora of ways to score points.  The nice components add even more to the game.  Althought it appears to be a lightweight game on the surface, it is full of many strategic decisions.  

I will say it does feel a little "solitairish" in the sense that there is not a large amount of player interaction.

Another Seyfarth's game with a ridiculously boring theme. But this time there is the excuse of not making another train game - which in essence it is. I enjoyed it at first, as there seemed to be some interesting choices, but I found that they don't really matter much, and it seems that everyone who plays with at least reasonable competence will eventually get to close results. It's just a race for various bonuses, and a lot comes down to luck of the draw. It does feel a little like a heavier and slightly better "Ticket to Ride", but with less tension and player interaction, since all players can share all cities and routes. And I couldn't see the point in penalizing players with pieces left in the end of the game.

Wow! Stunning. Funny thing, bought Finca yesterday, played it, liked it, but thought something was missing. Bought Thurn maybe 6 months ago, just played it today.

In Thurn, it is simply brilliant.

A decent route building game with a strong element of time pressure in trying to get the high scoring tiles for an area before others, and driving the game to an end when you need it to end. The job of balancing what bonuses you would like to score against what cards are going to be most available given other people's routes is enjoyable but becomes a little obvious on repeated plays. I feel the key to winning though is forcing the game to end at the right time for you, and the carriage race is the most tense and exciting part of the game for me.

Traded away in a job lot, in which I got Hansa Teutonica in return. I cannot imagine why I would play T&T instead of HT anymore.

Y'know, I didn't really like this so much when I first played it. Thought it was okay, but a bit ugly and not very exciting. Now after more plays face to face and on yucata.de I'm really interested by it and in honing my strategy. It's gone up from a 6 to an 8 for me and it's VERY rare that games go up in my estimation.

What would happen if the guy that created puerto rico decided to rip off ticket to ride?  Thurn and Taxis, thats what!You really don't need other people to play this game.  You can't plan ahead at all because of how much the board changes on other folks' turns.  There isn't even any "I stole your route" screwage like in ticket to ride.  I think I would avoid playing this again, just nothing appealing here.

RATING: 6.25
I feel that the "color rule" and map dictates too much what are good routes to try to get; and then the game has some randomness _restricting the core mechanic_ to prevent you from playing the way you think is best. I would not judge someone for liking this, but not my game at all.

I like the either all of one province or one of each rule.  Different and refreshing.  Kinda like Ticket to ride with the same thinking pattern.

RATING: 6
Possible strategy: figure out what goals/provinces the other players are striving for, and either try to beat them to that goal, or concentrate on a different goal.  But there is a lot of luck involved in the card draws in this game, so much that I don't know if a good strategy can overcome it regularly.  Perhaps this game is like San Juan in that respect -- if you happen to get the right cards (e.g. the Guild Hall!) at the right time, you're probably going to win.

"Thurn and Taxis: Power and Glory" is a much better game because it is less driven by luck of the draw.

I was afraid that it would Thurn bland and lifeless.
I particularly like the fact that the "route" each player is trying to build is visible, and the character you choose each turn for that extra edge.
I also realised, after my two or three first games, that there were strategy and planning in there: it is not a brain burner, but an experienced player will kick a newbie ass everytime, lucky or not.
Building a postal system for Germany seemed a bit dull as a theme but it turns out to be rather interesting, thanks to the spotless HiG design and bits, and also to the interesting history booklet in the box.
A strong and enjoyable game.

After one play.  Was 3rd in a 4-player game, and had the impression the 1st and 2nd player had a leg up on me as they would always score the higher point tiles/counters before me.  Perhaps my approach was bad?  Willing to give this one another try.

The cards are too small, but the rest of the gaming material is good.  Nice drawings on the cards, wooden houses.

RATING: 4
Thurn and Taxis is a game of network building, timing, and variable actions. As Seyfarth's foray into family gaming after his hit Puerto Rico, we see some similarities in the random draws of locations as well as the variable powers that you can do on your turn. However, where this game takes a few cues from Ticket to Ride, it also does away with much of the interaction that either PR or TTR have: gone are blocking and agressive shipping and role selection. Accordingly, T&T is largely a race. This is not to say that it is a bad game, but there's not too much for me here to actively seek out additional plays other than if it is for a very quick and casual play. Unfortunately, if you happen to play with a group who overthinks every move, what should be a quick and playful romp turns into a real slog (as the game also isn't as straight forward and simple as TTR). In other words, the added complexity doesn't necessarily add much more in terms of depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This is a good and quick game. Somehow this game reminds me of Ticket to Ride, with the cards and the route building. 

The depth is limited, and luck plays a role in the drawing of cards. It is enjoyable and plays in 30-45 minutes. Not deep enough to keep my interest and create any fascination, but I will not refuse to play.After all, I play for he fun, the social aspects and the interaction with other players. I would suggest this game as a gateway game (comparable to Ticket to Ride in terms of complexity), so good for families and casual gamers.

RATING: 7
Not a bad little route making game. The card drafting is reminiscent of Ticket to Ride, but what you do with the cards is far more interesting here. Completing a good route is satisfying but not so taxing as to slow down the proceedings. Overall a nice light diversion. The map could be a little more legible though. Just putting numbers on the towns would be a big help.

[Initial Impression: 7]
This game is impressively engineered: it's a well-oiled machine.  It is unfortunate that such simple  and integrated mechanics lead to such a routinized feeling during play.  Players gather sets of cards that they play to form routes, which allow them to place post offices in cities.  Players score points for completing routes of certain lengths and for placing sets of post offices. Players recruit various roles with special powers to help them on each turn.  The really clever bit is that the points scored for meeting each condition decrease if another player meets that same condition first. (This is very similar to the passenger scoring in Ticket to Ride: Marklin, but it doesn't diminish the cleverness.)  This turns it into basically a race to meet each condition first so that you'll score more points than your opponent.  You have to really carefully manage your route-planning (it also helps to get just a little lucky in your card draws) in order to stay competitive.  A few mistakes can really cost you the game. For the most part, each player is just building their own routes in isolation.  But competitive play does require interaction through A) grabbing bonus tiles before other players do and B) blocking maneuvers by keeping track of what cards other players need and trying to deny these to them (by taking them yourself or by clearing them off the board). The main problem for me was that even though some players catch on to the really competitive nature of the game more quickly than others, the scoring seems engineered to keep point counts reasonably close. Most games are won or lost by just a few points, but it isn't that thrilling once you realize that the closeness occurs because of the way the scoring mechanics work, not necessarily because you're well-matched with your opponents.

It flows very easy & i can see why this won the Spiel des Jahres. Nicely streamlined without complicated rules sticking out.
Having said that, i enjoy these kinds of light to medium euros only when there is a strong or cute theme on them. And there is none here.
I actually never really knew what the theme was supposed to be, i think something with delivering letters?
The mechanics won't tell you either.

But apart from that a balanced, mid-weight card-management game.

This game is about building routes and the mechanics of this game is during your turn take one of three actions : draw a tile, play a tile, score a route (optional). During your turn choose one of four special ability which may be advantageous to you.

Score when you have a 3,4,5,6,7 route and the game ends when a player scores the 7 route. There are bonuses if you complete an area.

I really wanted to like this game, and I did like it fairly well.  It has simple rules, fairly clever mechanics (I enjoyed being able to add onto my routes from either end.) and a variety of strategies.

Unfortunately it was shot down by the girlfriend for the same reasons that Hansa didn't work:
 - Not very confrontational.  (Perhaps it would be more interesting for her if we were competing for the same cities.)
 - In early plays, you seem to "Get points by accident".  She got 6 points and won because she accidentally had one post office in each region (color).
 - theme is weakly tied together.  The "post offices" look like houses, and I really didn't get the feeling that I was building a post office empire.  It is a little odd that you are building routes, but the routes themselves (the connections between two cities) is not represented on the board, rather only the cities themselves are represented.

It is a well thought out system and gameplay seems smooth, but it isn't exceptionally engaging.  (It is more engaging than Hansa.)  It feels somewhere between Power Grid and Ticket to Ride in terms of both complexity and engaging-ness.

Thurn and Taxis fixes many of the route building issues that I saw in Ticket to Ride, and replaced them with a set of diminishing awards, permitting players to repeat routes if desired, but also rewarding the first players to do so.

It seems an inevitable comparison, but in mnay ways Thurn and Taxis is both more forgiving and more interesting to me than the Ticket to Ride series, especially when one considers the race to gain Carriages, the race to complete routes, and the race to venture to all the postal regions.

Some of the gaminess of the various route cards is still here, but on the whole I think I'd prefer a game of Thurn and Taxis to Ticket most days.

Simple mechanics, straight-forward play, with oodles of fun and thought provoking options, that plays in 60 minutes--What is there not to like? I can see why this won the Spiel Des Jahres, as it is accessible to both young and old alike, and could serve as an excellent gateway game. Relatively small decision tree, with a card selection mechanic a la Ticket To Ride, with a push-your-luck element in whether to continue extending your network or cash-in and take those VPs. Only quibble is that there is no player interaction, except for how the card queue is manipulated by the players. Otherwise, it is a traveling salesman optimization VP race game, but it scratches the itch for something between a filler and a medium-weight game.

Update (1/2/11) 4 plays: Quickly dropping out of sight as quickly as it rose; it has no staying power as it is essentially multi-player solitaire, and who wants that? Not me.

This is a nicely made game.  Certainly it is one of the most beautiful boards out there.  There is just something dry and kind of boring about it.  I will play when asked, but it's not necessarily one I would reach for myself anymore.  It doesn't help that my wife doesn't like it.  Traded this away with Mille Bornes for Masons in the Springtime Math Trade 04/2008.  Not the greatest trade and I kinda wish I hadn't done it, but I really like Masons.  09/2016 - Finally got this one back.  I missed this game.

Played at a game club and quite enjoyed it. Some interesting mechanisms with deciding which cities to include in your routes and which order to play them in. Also has some nice options on how to gather points and deciding to rush for or delay the end game - and a number of different special abilities to use.
Reletively light once you first learn.
The theme can feel a bit of an afterthought and the board design, though pretty, can be a little hard to decipher when it gets busy.

Card drafting and set collection and claiming things on the board to do with travel between cities.  But this isn't Ticket to Ride, this is shorter, more challenging and in fact only superficially similar.  But it comes down to an exercise in optimization.

RATING: 7
Solid, medium weight game. The town names is a bit of a nuisance, but I can look past that because of the super streamlined system. It does hurt the ability to play with non-gamers, though. Would love to see a US version of the map/game.

RATING: 7
A route building game with lashings of attractive artwork. Many more scoring options than in Ticket to Ride, but a combination of random card draw and tight scoring suggests to me that the outcome may be more dependent on luck than initially appears to be the case. This is the kind of light Euro that I normally enjoy, but I won't be buying as Ticket to Ride has more player interaction.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Very dull game. It's not just the lack of interaction 
(I love some low interaction games) but the total lack of anything interesting to do other than hope the card you want is still there when it's your turn. A bit like ticket to ride, without the fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like this quite a bit. Plans can be damaged but not permanently destroyed. The challenge is in remembering to stick with short-term goals and not to be too greedy.  The tradeoff between long routes and short routes, and placement on one color or many, is quite interesting.

A more interesting and strategic take on route building than Ticket to Ride.  Nothing's more frustrating than watching the cards you've been waiting to pull from the board get swept away by your opponent's clear action.

RATING: 8
First played this on Jan 24, 2007.  An interesting easy game to play. The rules seem a bit difficult to grasp, however after a few turns it starts to come together.  There is a decent amount of strategy to this and is different enough from other games to warrent a position in the rotation of games to play. Each player starts with 20 houses. The board starts with 6 city cards to choose from and victory points placed on the board. You build mail routes to score. On your turn you MUST take a city card, you MUST play a city card into a new or existing mail route. That card must be adjacent to the previous city(ies) or you will need to start a new mail route (wiping previous). You may go through a city multiple times. You MAY score your mail route. To score, you must have at least 3 cities. You may place houses in either all of the same color OR 1 in each different color card city. After placement, you check to see if you recieve any bonus VP for havhing a long route or all of a region. Also when you complete a route, you upgrade your carriage house for VP if you have enough cities played to match the carriage house you are getting. You must take the carriage house upgrades in order, 3,4,5,6,7 without skipping. Once during each turn you MAY use an official to help out your cause: Postmaster (place two cities); P (gain two cities); Administrator (clear and replace 6 city cards to choose from); X (upgrade carriage house 1 or 2 more than cards played).

Thurn & Taxis. Wow. This game blew me away. At the onset, the rules set seems dry, particularly the system of how bonus points tiles are awarded. However, I loved the mental puzzle of trying to optimize the play of my cards in establishing postal routes in 16th century Germany, Austria, and surrounding areas. I like the weight and length of the game: a two hour game with relatively simple rules set--not Knizia simple, but significantly less complex than Five Tribes or Concordia. This game spoke to me and I enjoyed it immensely. It really surprised me. I wasn't expecting a lot and T & T is very fun. I would liken it as a more interesting, deeper version of ticket to ride. I can't wait to play this game some more.

Lots of talk about this being an unforgiving game.  It is so simple that it seems to be hard to screw up if you follow simple planning and basic strategy.  Plays very fast and is pleasantly thinky without bogging down.  Too bad it only plays up to four.  Must look at the expansion.

I good gateway game.  While you collect cards  to create routes, you also try to place your pieces in the different cities and regions so you can get the bonus points.  You also want to create longer routes so you can get the better carriages.  A fun game with several things to work on. 

As has been mentioned in some reviews and sessions reports you do not want to think about what cards you will take next in a 3 or 4 player game. If you try  to plan to far ahead you will get frustrated as the available cards will change considerably before it is your turn again.  Wait until the player before you to start looking at the available cards.

After two plays, one with four and one with three, I definitely think that while this is a fun game similar to Ticket to Ride in some senses, but less cut-throat, it has some scaling issues in my opinion.  I need to play it again with three or two and then I will know for sure.

I can see why this won the Spiel des Jahres, but it doesn't really appeal to me as much as the other great games that came out this year.  It feels too much like Ticket to Ride without any of the interaction or tension, instead substituting a more lenient Euro experience.  There also seemed to be too much luck in the draw and not much room for any sort of planning.  Don't even try to decipher the theme because it's totally non existent and if uncovered, quite lame at that.  I don't know, I just wasn't especially grabbed by this one.

RATING: 2.8
Got this is a trade mainly because it was favorably compared to Ticket to Ride.  It's a fine game, but it's not nearly as great as ticket to ride.

Pros: I really like the "push-your-luck" aspect of the route building.  I enjoy the risky decisions that it offers to me.  I also enjoy the decision of what "character" to enlist help from each turn.

Cons: It's a passive aggressive play land.  The only interaction is to hate draft the cards, and it's hard to do that without hurting yourself.  The biggest Con though, is that it's just not as good as TtR.  It takes longer to setup, it takes longer to explain, it doesn't have as nice of components, and it just isn't as elegant (Don't keep more than 3 cards?!?  Have to choose the take 2 guy?!?  Bugger that.)

Thurn and Taxis is a beautifully presented game with simple rules and thus is eminently suitable for playing with non-gamers. It also offers something for dedicated boardgamers. On a tactical level, the game is more complex than it seems at first glance. Turn-by-turn decisions are important in terms of the efficiency of placing houses and managing the risk of the cards. Tactical mistakes (particularly towards the end of the game) can significantly prejudice a player's final score. The well-balanced scoring mechanisms further enhance the tactical possibilities and even add an element of longer term planning to the game. On the negative side, there is little interaction between players and a lack of variation means that the game starts to become stale after several plays.

What really amazes me is the replayability - I never get bored with it.

EDIT: And yet - after a dozen of plays - I got somewhat bored.  Mix it with the occasional lack of control (->no matter what you do you won't win because the others outpace you having _just_ a little more luck with cards) and there you go.  A candidate for sale.

RATING: 6
initial rating

It's true what most people are saying, its like TtR with a little more going on, very little interaction, themeless, a dose of luck, suspected bad replay value, it also ran a little long with 4 players. Several ways to score on the positive side with scoring depreciating the longer you take to do it but not being able to block was totally bad in a route planning game. Would like to try with 2 or 3 players and suspect with those numbers this might be better, also, this might be better suited for "quicker" online play. Its not 'bad' but I won't be requesting this...ever

Update: 5 => 6 Played again years later, MUCH better with only 2 or 3 players, not as long or as much downtime (it wasnt high but now it is less). It makes a decent filler with the scoring options as the highlight, but is still a touch long for that class otherwise my rating might have been 6.5 or 7. 

The luck is not bad at all actually especially for the games length and having the option to clear the board helps and was a nice touch as was having 6 cards face up. Wouldn't request this but would likely play again, found it to be much better than China also which I recently played (and of course worlds better than TtR).

Thurn und Taxis is a fun game that combines route planning and card management.  While the game doesn't have a huge amount of player interaction a well-timed Administrator or simply holding a card your opponent desires can cause problems.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Keep seeing words like 'Solid' and 'Good' on these comments and this sums Thurn up pretty well. It's... nice enough. Game of the Year? Maybe. I've got an inkling after 4 plays that something really clever is going to reach out and grab me, but I might be just hoping for too much. It feels very much like a cross between Paris Paris and T2R, even though the gameplay is different to both. 

All just feels a bit too familiar, though. Nothing standout here, other than the look of the thing, which is very nice. I'm really hoping it'll surprise me but 4 plays in I'm still somewhat underwhelmed. 

Interesting fact : A non gamer friend actually told me the 'theme of the game seems to not quite fit' - interesting and arguably true. The theme is well done, unusual, and lavishly applied, but all a bit too thickly for my tastes. 
As he said; "What the hell has putting houses in coloured areas got to do with delivering mail?". We know the answer, of course, but it DOES feel a lot like that when playing.

Since I dislike Puerto Rico, this will have to go down as my favorite Seyfarth game.  While the play is entirely different from Ticket to Ride, it has a similar competing-for-routes feel, along with the tension of "score a sure thing this turn, or push it for one more turn?"

RATING: 5
Postal route planning across Germany. While I can't find any big flaws with T&T, I can find little to excite me either. The game is firmly in the family category, occasionally presenting you with some interesting choices, but on the whole it comes across as slightly boring and as something grandma might have a fighting chance at. That being said, I played it with my wife and mother-in-law, and the latter (a veteran Carcassonne player) didn't like it one bit.

We play this as a "filler game."

Needs more interaction form me.  Won my first and only game by a landslide, just by paying attention to the others and keeping one step ahead.  Might be fun with the kids, but plenty of others to play.

After a few more games: I've found the triggers for interaction - paying attention to other routes.  I've been able to grab cards that others need to win games, as long as they are potentially useful to myself.  There is also several strategies to win this game, which I didn't see at first.

Initial Rating : 6.5 (December 2011)

I had high hopes for Thurn and Taxis, lots of my friends liked the game a lot but after some plays it is a disappointment for me. I liked my first game, but with each play I rated it lower and lower. I feel all the games play the same way so I have no desire to further explore this.

I don¬¥t like anything about the game, the theme is awful and bland (to me), takes a long playtime for what the game offers, it has obvious decisions, when playing with 4 I feel a lot of downtime, the game is not fun and it has a lot of luck of the draw. 

On the plus side, the components are ok I guess, and this game could be used to introduce new gamers to the hobby as it is very light and family friendly, but it is not a game for me.

I only play it when a friend wants to and I always offer some resistance to the suggestion.

Current Rating: 4.5

I like this more each time I play it which is a good sign for an award winner.  At first I didn't care for it.  It also helps that it plays well as a two-player though it's a little bit like solitaire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After 1 play: Draw one or two cards from a face up pool of six, collect connected sets to create routes, play the sets one card at a time (with a "push your luck" aspect) until you decide to cash in your route. Race to be the first (or early) to achieve each of about ten different objectives... in many ways it [i]is[/i] reminiscent of Ticket to Ride. But with much [i]less[/i] player interaction. (Yup, you heard it folks ... even less interaction than TtR.)

I'm really not great with multiplayer solitaire. (And I don't often use this phrase about a game.)

I actually enjoyed this much more than I thought. I came so damn close to finishing off a huge route, but was snookered one round short!

I did not expect to enjoy it that much and was worried that it would be to Ticket To Ride derivative, but it held it's own very well.

It's much lighter that Puerto Rico--more inline with Manhattan in weight/feel--I liked it. I'm glad I picked it up on my friend Burl's recommendation.

It works for casual gamers too.

RATING: 7.5
Good lighter Euro, reminiscent of Ticket to Ride (as others have said) but doesn't support the same level of card-hogging that I've seen in that game. 

Attractive and with some decent decision making. There's a push-your-luck element when building long routes (you don't want to have to scrap a 5 town route because you can't add a 6th..), when to go for which bonus marker, when to go for the high-value mail coaches.

Happy to play this one.

RATING: 9
If you are expecting a heavy, brain burner of a game with T&T, you aren't going to get it.  The game plays light and fast.

Player interaction is all in the race to get the 'Bonus Chips' which are worth Victory Points.   Even though there is only a 1 or 2 point difference in the chip values, because of the tight end-game scoring, EVERY SINGLE POINT can make a BIG difference.

Only six of the 22 areas will, more than likely, be represented in the face up cards, so clearing the board will normally show less than half the areas you may want to build.  Whoever said that there is no player interaction has never been screwed out of a card they've had their eye on by the player to their right as they discard the six face-up cards, knowing full well that you needed one of them. "Didn't get a replacement?  Oops, sorry!"... "Yeah, I'll bet you are."

It also has a bit of a "push your luck" element, when attempting to build a route without a card in hand.  Seeing six-length route disappear because you fail to play a card can be very demoralising... especially if getting the right card would have put you in the lead.

T&T has just the right mix of skill and luck, with enough subtle play to keep most gamers interested.  It is definitely worthy of its Spiel des Jahres win.

A fun and (once you've learned it) quick game of building postal routes through Germany.  Anyone who's read "The Crying of Lot 49" must play this game at least once!  Every round you draw and play to a route, then optionally cash the route in.  Nice role mechanic lets you decide between drawing twice, playing twice, or doing various "I'm screwed" mechanics.  Nice eschaton mechanic makes it critical that you build up about as quickly as your opponents, and can make it tricky to decide between a long and high-scoring route and a short route that will move you forward more quickly (and allow you to place more of your little birdhouses on the board).

This is no PR, or Caylus, or Settlers, but it is quite a good little game in its own right and the quick play time makes it easy to squeeze in before or after a longer game.  The downside: too easy to pull it out when we're too lazy to play something better but longer!

I can see where some might compare it to Web of Power or China.  It has a similar feel regarding weight and having the cards dictate your possibilities.  For me, this is better than Web of Power, and way better than China (don't get me started on that one).  I like the many options available for scoring, I like the special actions (or whatever they're called), I like the decision between placing 1 PO in each country vs. all of 1 country, and I like the extend your route or wipe it clean mechanic.  It's very reminiscent of Knizia in the many little twists and nuances.  All in all, about the worst thing I can say about it is the theme is weird and the tie-breaker is lame (the person who ended it or clockwise from the person who ended it).

A route-connecting game with a charming theme. Players are competing couriers in the 16th century mail service in Germany, racing to establish long-rang service, intra-province service, and inter-province service. It works well enough and held an 8 rating from me for 10-12 plays. I just don't see much in it now. The game really does seem played-out, and the only thing left is for players to become good card-counters. It's well designed and beautifully produced - no question, but the strategies (are there more than two or three?) all play out in roughly the same way once you're familiar with the game. Essentially, it's not that hard to make your decisions, which foregrounds the random draw element (only partly addressed by game mechanics). Sad to say, but currently this is more like a six for me. Perhaps a twice-a-year game. Only keeping it because it's popular with the SO. That, and I'm fond of the quirky theme.

The more I play this game, the less it appeals to me. It's certainly a good game, and I do enjoy it but the desire to play it has faded considerably since it came out. I strongly believe this game should not have won the SDJ and instead Blue Moon City should have won... but what are you going to do...

The mechanics in this game are very solid and it's easy enough to explain. There isn't much in the way of differing strategies. You want to build lots of routes and you would like to get chits with lots of points, so it's best to be the first one to get a post office in each city of a district. This game is really about hand management and a bit of risk assessment since you might need to hope for a card to play when you do the administration action on your next turn. 

I guess the real downside to the game is that there isn't anything there for the experienced player, the first 4 to 6 games will be very fun and rewarding as you learn how to play the game, but there isn't anything waiting for you on the other side of that learning curve.

Not a deeply strategic game, but you need to be nimble with your tactics - ready to change direction depending on what city cards become available to you...

A pretty good light-middleweight Euro. Certainly it has some similarities to Ticket to Ride, but it also has similarities with area-control/-influence games. You are, of course, connecting routes, but you don't foreclose other people's routes by making your own, nor are you (as is effectively the case in TtR) restricted from going into the same city twice. Indeed, I think if you play it like TtR, you're likely to miss the fact that it's not just about connecting cities but about enclosing areas.

T&T feels a little more similar to Atlantic Star/Showmanager than Ticket to Ride/China (the games that I've seen this most connected to), with slightly different constraints on set collecting.  I can see how with a competitive group this could get very interesting.  I'm not sure about replayability, but for now I'm eager to keep playing.

Update: I find myself not wanting to play this very often.  My main gripe is a lack of a way to catch the leader, or to even fight back against another player.  Maybe that's what the complaints of lack of player interaction are about.  If I do play this, I like it to be quick - I've seen some pretty long games and I wouldn't want it to last more than 30 minutes, 40 minutes tops.

A gamer's TTR, with special powers and different route bonuses. The game does feel unnaturally close and it gets to the point where regardless of what route you take, you end up being neck-and-neck with the other players, but its still an enjoyable game.

Enjoyed my first game of this a fair bit. It felt much like Ticket to Ride but with greater choices and sped up gameplay. The graphics are great. The theme is fairly poorly implemented in game rules. There is some luck involved but not enough to destroy such a quick and enjoyable game. I'm keen to play again.

The aim of the game is to collect the cards and to make postal routes. I don't know why, but I like this game. Probably because I usually like route building games.

I feel this game will (eventually) fill the long filler (30-45 min) spot with experienced players.  For that length of game, I think it is excellent.  There has been a lot of comparisons with Ticket to Ride, but I don't feel that it is similar.

Upgraded to a 9 after 8 plays (in two weeks--which is very high for me).

Downgraded down back to a 8 after 20+ plays.  I seemed to lose some interest in playing it.

Downgraded to a 7.  It hasn't hit the table for quite a while now.

I liked Thurn and Taxis a little better after two things happened: 1) I realized you can expand a route at either end, and 2) I mentally erased the theme and just thought of it as a race to fill up a collection of abstract spaces. I think it should be inoffensive and enjoyable, even though player interaction is pretty much limited to someone punching the reset button when the card you wanted was in the draft.

I rate this pretty similarly to Settlers of Catan, in that I think it would make for a nice introduction to modern board games. It's a little dry for me thematically, but plenty of opportunity to change tactics based on what cards come up on your turn. For the same reason, however, it is difficult to plan ahead as the person before you can swap all of the cards available.

Our first play with this was with a player who normally takes forever to "catch on" to a game (sometimes he never does). By the end of this one he was fully engaged.
Our fourth play was marred by a player with a tendency for analysis paralysis, but it was still a good play.
I like it.  Some of the complaints I'm reading about it are actually good reasons to like it with the right group.  I think it's a good game to introduce to non-gamers.

Played again in a 4p game with some folks at the FLGS. Wow--a completely different (and better) experience. It helped that everyone at the table was fine with a little trash talk...tho I was the one who, ultimately, got trashed.


:::Old comment:::
On the fence about this one.  Only played a 2p game with my wife.  It was her favorite of the lighter games we've played together, but that's like saying "It was her favorite of the many different varieties of puke we've sampled."

I felt the decision making was never very tense.  Makes for an okay 2p, but for tension and interaction I much prefer TtR and especially TtR: Marklin.

Wanted to like this as I really like the route planning / risk management genre.  The rating is dreadfully low simply because the winner of the game I played still didn't understand the scoring mechanism come the end of the game - and any game where that applies has got to be fundamentally flawed. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Mechanics are too much like Ticket to Ride. After 2 plays, I am thinking it may wind up on the trade pile. This game just seems to have too much potential for frustration. If you have one turn where you can't get a card you can use, chances are you should just concede the game right there. Best strategy seems to be take what's available and hope for the best. If you try to plan for anything specific, that's when you paint yourself into a corner you can't escape.

RATING: 7
I like this game. The rules are simple yet there is some depth to the game play. Timing is crucial and sometimes the key play can be to take a shorter route than necessary for the next carriage card in order to get the higher bonus tile in a particular province. I think this game is different enough from Ticket to Ride that you could find room on your shelf for both, though I think this one wins out in my opinion. The game plays fast enough that you can play multiple games in a short game night. The rulebook could use another editing, but the quality of the artwork is spectacular. All and all this was great addition to my collection (and a great surprise birthday present from my girlfriend).

Overall, I would give this a solid 7 out of 10. There are certainly games I would rather play if given the choice, but I also wouldn't be disappointed to get this on the table.

I like a lot about this game:  easy to pick-up, lots of ways to get points, generally fun to play. 
The reason it isn't rated higher for me is the solitaire aspect of the game.  Yes, you do compete with players for scoring markers, but there is really very little you can do to slow another player down, other than take the card you both need (but that really comes to down to being fortunate with your card draw).

I had high hopes for this, as I love TTR:E, and Thurn & Taxis is often compared to the TTR series.  While there are some quite interesting decisions, and the tension can be great as the end of the game nears, the options for player interaction are practically nonexistant.

Now that T&T is on yucata.de, I'll be giving it a second chance, soon.

It's solid, involves nice planning and easy enough to pickup to serve as an intro to heavier stuff.  The cards still make this somewhat random, casual and mistake friendly, but why not.  There's definitely room for quality, accessible and still interesting games like this. It's sort of half way between things like ticket to ride and a real gamers' game.

We got this game as one of our first Euros.    I think it's a mediocre good game.  I guess you could say it is a more advanced Ticket to Ride, although it is different.  The luck of the cards can be annoying.  The board is fine looking, and the pieces are fine. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This has been compared with Web of Power and Showmanager and Ticket to Ride.  To me, it really only has slight similarities in mechanics with them.  It's a card (city-connection) collection game of trying to place all your houses on the board while making a series of city connections (carriages).  Getting houses on the cities are important as well as attaining bonus chits.  Cards are acquired via a draft board (i.e. Showmanager) with an option to select one of four officials or roles.  It's essentially a race of card collections with quirky house placement rules (i.e. Web of Power).  Whomever optimizes their course of making and laying efficient card sets will likely get the win.

Just based on one play with 4 players, I was frequently frustrated by having to change plans and seeing my desired route cards taken by preceding players.  Seems that it would be a better game with 2-3 players than with 4.  Still, I'm quite willing to give it another chance sometime.  Much better as a 2 player game.  As a two player game, I'd give it a 7.

This is an interesting set collection/route playing game that is a bit reminiscent of Ticket to Ride but offers more opportunity for clever play.  There are many tactical decisions to make each turn in order to maximize your point scoring opportunities and there are also a few larger strategic goals that must be taken into account as well (in terms of placing houses in such a way as to maximize future routes, etc.)

RATING: 5
What a pity that the winner of the 2006 SdJ is so similar to the winner of 2004. Thurn and Taxis is a very solid game, of course, but it feels too much like Ticket to Ride without its elegant simplicity. By adding special powers and complexifying the scoring system with point tiles and carts, T&T gained in weight, which makes it more of a gamer's game, but it also lost that magic quality of attracting total newbies that T2R has. 

It's also harder to follow what's happening in the game because a lot of the action happens in the cards in front of each player and not just on the board. But I suppose in the end, since player interaction is so limited, it doesn't matter that much.

The game was as good as advertised, although it really doesn't feel too much like [GAMEID=9209].  Compared to [GAMEID=9209], it's not quite as visceral---it's not as easy to pick up, it's not as confrontational, and it's not as gut wrenching as you're waiting for the right color card to come up to grab your route before someone else does.  Instead, it's a much more thoughtful game.  There's no direct blocking, although your opponent can take the card you're looking for.  Instead of completing tickets, the route building was a set up for an area control mechanism as you try to grab each region's bonus points first.  It's definitely an optimization, efficiency game and it works very well with two players.

Similar to [GAMEID=6249], we've never really had the urge to try out any of the expansions.  I guess after Carcassonne, we're just expansion'd out...

'Ticket To China' - NOT. I wish.

Okay game - probably my rating will increase after more plays. Guy who taught me the game got very nervous when I looked through all of the score markers on the board. Not so good 2 player. Slave to the card draw, blech. May as well dice for the win.

[2007-03-22] Tossed this mid-game the other night for [GameID=41]. Tossed it mid-game last night (2-player) for Babel. Dropped rating from 6 to 5. Still trying to like this.

[2007-06-??]Trying this again to see. I predict my rating will jump a point (still a 5 though).

[2008-04-??] Better. Still a first player advantage. Rating will never rise higher than '6'. My lady likes it so this will appear again and again and again...

The criticism that this game lacks player interaction, while founded, is overblown. The game's a race. You have do things before the other players do. If an opponent reaches a milestone before you do, you may have to shift to make up the point, and you have to be in flexible enough position to do so. This is also a game that rewards repeated play. If everyone's familiar, the game goes very, very quickly (20 minutes is possible), so the racing is really a sprint. Two players is almost as good a game as three or four, another big plus.

Bought UK Game Expo 2013. Very tight scoring, if you want to get ahead and finish the game early you need to make very good decisions regarding which helpers to make use of. Cartwright especially. Because of the tightness in scoring this feels more like a race game than a Euro. But I like it and it is a very good gateway game, albeit somewhat punishing if you make mistakes.

Update August 2014: So we had been scoring all of the cards you get, not realising you only score the longest route card. Now the game is a little more balanced and you can neglect the length of the routes a little more if you please in order to hoick as many tiles as possible instead. It makes for a much better game and is a lot more balanced. Still enjoying this game a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Somewhat similar to Ticket to Ride but it does have its own flavour and variation in rules.  Instead of trains, players are trying to link horse and carriage taxi routes.  Scoring is mission based but also bonuses are awarded by territorial accomplishments.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game but nothing revolutionnary. Important to check what other people do especially when they try to end the game. It is more a "race" game than a connection game. You have to decide quickly if you go with big bonus (Baiern or anything but bairn) or if you go with a bigger Coach. The inclusion of the Support role is good as each support action fulfill different needs.

Feel a bit dry and underwhelming to me though.

Update: Played again. This game is really a race. You cannot influence your opponent. You just have to be quicker than them. I won easily by never losing a turn and never building a road too long or too short. I earn all my carts in the order. I still think the game is a bit bland.

Update: the game is well constructed. There is a different action for each "goal" in game: drawng more cards, plagin more cards and getting a carriage. I still think there is no real player interaction except for the race aspect of getting bonuses. All in all it's a well crafted game but I think the "fun" is missing from it. There is no real tension (like in Ticket to ride to which it is often compared).

A decent game. I originally purchased this because it was described to me as "like Ticket to Ride but BETTER!"  I hate to say it but I think that assessment is wrong now.  Thurn and Taxis is different from Ticket to Ride but I am not sure it is definitely better.

Things I like:  Lots of ways to get VP tokens.
Dislike: No real way to interact and block other players like you can in Ticket to Ride.

A simple set collection game where you are trying to build postal routes and when you score your route, it allows you to put post offices on different color terrain.  Once you have a post office in all the terrain, you collect a scoring tile for the region.  It has a Ticket to Ride complexity so it is very light, family weight game.  Some people find the game a little dry, but I like it.  It is very good Spiel des Jahres winner.  The expansions open the game up with other ways to play and more maps.

9/2006 Expectations were high for "Spiel des jares", but only partly fulfilled.  The major problem is down-time.  Selecting 1-2 cards from a ever changing pool of 6 at start of your turn makes planning very difficult - you're just waiting until its your turn before starting to think/plan given the available cards.  Further play might reveal that there's more to the game, but I doubt it will raise my rating.

I find it hard to comment on thisone. Although it is a simple game where you collect cards and combine them in the right way to score points, there is some fun in doing that. The game material is very dark colored which doesn't make it the happiest game to look at, and still, it was assigned game of the year. 
Maybe it's the simple rules, original theme and "game for everyone" that did the job.

Great material, fast, simple and offer a lot of choices since the objectifs are the same for everybody but we cannot do all of them.  It's a optimization game with good balance of luck since this can be control with the special characters.  Is kind of a race for the first person to reach the maximum of points for each objectives and how they can managed their cards to do the most points.

Just received this from an auction.  Looking forward to first play.

9-24-11-Just played my 2nd 2 player game and we really like this one.  It's different in that while there's not a lot of interaction or direct conflict, we find that we are intensely interested in each other's moves.  Wonder if that will change as we get more used to the game.

Quiet game but involving.  Often compared to Ticket to Ride.  I don't get the same feel from it though.  We really like it.

Super game with 2 persons. Some people here say that there is a lack of interaction, I do not agree with that.

I'm so happy with this one because it's got some fun, light, Web Of Power/Ticket to Ride-ish gameplay in a package that's evocative. The graduated scoring chits are a clever idea, and there's good tension between the competing ways to earn the most points quickly. It's a winning combination of advantages that my wife enjoys playing, so it gets a lot of love from me.

A quite interesting connection game. You got some cards with territories and have to connect them to score, but you can only score each time provinces from different regions or else all the provinces from a single regions. This makes for different strategies. It has a bunch of expansions which I find quite interesting. Played in yucata.de
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's hard to shake Ticket to Ride instincts when playing this, given that TtR is in this game's DNA, but it's quite different.

I like the race aspect, the push-your-luck element, and the way the bonuses are structured. With two, it's a bit more strategic; with 3+ it's more tactical since you have a reduced chance of getting what you're planning for.

The board is beautiful and pleasant-looking, if a bit subtle; I'd prefer slightly clearer borders and a bit more differentiation between the cities.

Nice game, but not better than other options I break out more often. I wasn't sure why this was still on the shelf, so I sold it.

RATING: 5
Interesting in both the 3 and 4 player games we've played.  First game took over an hour, from then on it has been a less than one hour affair.  The rating still could go up or down based on more plays, there are some things I like (hard choices) and some I don't (the endgame, turn order).  Downgraded after more plays, simply prefer other games that take the same time and play with 3 or 4 players.  Definitely losing interest in this one - not as replayable.
UPDATE: At this point I probably will only play it if someone begs for it.

March 2013: I'm not sure if I enjoy this or Ticket to Ride better. I've rated them both the same.

Update 1/2/14: I hadn't played this one in a while. I had an itch to play it tonight. I'm going to leave my rating where it's at after 2 more plays. It's a cute game. There's definitely nothing groundbreaking here--just a quick family game. It could easily frustrate serious gamers because of the high amount of randomness. Even in a 2 player game, the change in card setup can become chaotic, leading to turn-based rather than long-term strategical planning. That said, the game does offer some alternative paths to victory if you are unfortunate with your card drawing. I think this is a great family game, especially if you have kids from 8-14. In short, it might sit on the shelf for a while.

I like this game a lot.  It plays like Ticket to Ride but requires a bit more thought. There isn't much player interaction beyond decreasing what other players will score for different regions though.

RATING: 7
GAMEPLAY: A network-building and card-drafting eurogame. Each turn, players draw one or two city cards from a display of six face-up cards or from the face-down deck. Players play one or two cards from their hand during each turn to begin or add to a route consisting of adjacent cities; routes that include three or more cities may be closed and scored. Upon closing and scoring a route a player may place houses in the cities included in the route, earn bonus tiles, and obtain successively larger carriages, all of which increase the player‚Äôs victory points. The game ends at the end of a round in which one or more players either exhaust their supply of 20 houses or earn the largest available carriage.

WEIGHT: Medium-light. The rules are not complex.

PLAYER INTERACTION/CONFLICT: Low. Any number of players may place a house in the same city.

PLAYER COUNT: Scales very well from two to four players. Gameplay feels the same at all player counts. An excellent two-player game.

LUCK: Low to moderate. It‚Äôs a card game and sometimes you are looking for a particular card. But the display of six cards decreases the problem. Players also have the option of resetting the display of six cards.

Nearly perfect light-medium euro. Simple rules, legitimate decisions to be made each turn (but not too heavy to overwhelm), light player interaction (but not in a nasty way), a feeling of a race with multiple ways to win, and beautiful artwork (subdued color scheme is soothing rather than drab, in this case).

I really like that you can close the game out with the 7 town carriage or by getting all your houses out. It is definitely possible to win with a series of short routes if you get all your houses out each time and get a bunch of the region bonuses, especially if your opponents still have many houses in hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
Nice components, rules are not too difficult to explain, yet the game doesn't taste too simple to general gamers. So it has all the elements to be entitled as a "great gateway game". However, There are some minor but obvious problems in here. The rule sounds strange when it is applied to a "postal system". For example, it is not intuitive to have a rule like "put only one office into each different region of the route, or put all office into only one region of the route". And the color tone of the board is dull, tho the artwork is fine. 
-----Update: after 4 online 2players games, I agree that it could be a good couple game that can also scale up. It is still painful to look for the places on the map before I remember all city name.
-----Update: The more I played it the more I appreciate it. Raised to 9.

Route optimization is a mechanic I tend to enjoy a great deal, and this game throws a lot at the player to think about, the best of which is the addition of descending numbers of available points dependent on the timing of each player accomplishing goals.  It is a small thing that makes a large difference not only in a comparison with other titles but also between each game of Thurn & Taxis as you have to respond to the direction that the other players take.

Good game. Love the component, not too heay, but does have some strategies... I wonder how the add-ons affect the game. I was skeptic with the fact that you chose a bonus everytime you play, but making the right choice at the right time can definetely make or break your game. It is a forgiving game, but don't make too many wrong turn or you'll end up traling. I love the bonus tiles, it does affects a player's recipe for success.

Rating based on one play with 4 players.  It looks very nice and gameplay is simple.  I would gladly play it more, but it didn't really reach out and grab me like I thought it might.  Given the choice, I think I'd rather play something like Amazonas.

My first impressions of this game were mostly indifferent, as I felt it wasn't a bad game, but that there were other games that I'd rather play.  However, after a few plays I really started enjoying it much more.  It works great as a gateway game, and while it's light on strategy and mostly a multiplayer solitaire game, I still have a good time while playing it.  I think the rules are simple enough for casual players to easily pick up on, and there's enough strategy to keep better players entertained, plus there's just enough tension to keep things fun amongst everyone.  While I still believe there are better gateway games, I certainly enjoy playing this one.

This is an OK game but it seems to me to lack what the french call, I don't know what. I'd play again, but I don't think I'd suggest it.

Update: Downgraded to a 5. Maybe it's purely situational, but I've been bored to tears playing this game. That said, it does make it easier to talk to other people coming and going.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Game in a Nutshell: It's been a while, but I think you collect cards in order to set up mailing routes. The first to do things get more points then others and that, more or less, is where the interaction ends.

Played as: 4 player

Pros: It's a fast game to learn.

Cons: The game feels too straight forward; take what looks like is the best option available, layout what's been handed to you, repeat.

Other notes: Only played this one once, and have too many other games to think of giving it a second try.

Best Use: Something light and straight-forward for the complexity challenged Euro-gamer.

When this was released I heard it compared often to Ticket to Ride. There a many similarities between the games but also some significant differences:

- There is less direct interaction and conflict between players. It's a friendlier game than Ticket to Ride (which can get quite cut-throat).
- It's even more of a race than Ticket to Ride. The strategy of hoarding cards can work in Ticket to Ride, but won't work here.
- The choice of special role each round in Thurn und Taxis is delicious. You often want to do 3 or 4 but can only choose one.

I enjoy both, but I think my preference is for Thurn und Taxis.

As many have said it's a little Ticket to Ride and a little bit Web of Power.  Overall I didn't think it was compelling as either and it was certainly dryer-feeling.  I like more direct interaction in my connection games.  Would like to try again to see if I can expand my opinion.  UPDATE: (Raised rating 1.5 points) I've had the opportunity to play this a number of times now and I think it works quite well (it helps if you're familiar with the game).  You need to be flexible with your route placements/card choices but very efficient with your actions.  Pay attention to what your opponents are doing so you can screw with them a bit.

Great light path-mapping Euro.  Like the board art/components.  Card turnover adds a fast feel to the game--can sometimes be suspenseful, too.

Strangely, the first word that pops to my mind about this game is - mature (not in that sense, you rascal! ;) ).

It has very subtle yet truly masterful artwork. It has an accurate map of a portion of historical Europe, and its theme portrays accurate historical developments. Mechanics are simple and enjoyable. Components are nothing flashy, but pretty and top quality, and with nice details which show on a deeper inspection.

All in all, a very nice game. No big enthusiasm, no big complaints, nice, subtle, and... well, mature.

Simple route builder but quite fun. Without blocking it's less interactive than Ticket to Ride and without route cards it's less directed. It's all about chasing bonuses and optimizing them based on card availability.

After quite a few more plays, I'm beginning to feel the endgame is too swingy. Equal-ish players with equal-ish luck can be neck-and-neck until one hits the final play, ends the game, and wins by a margin. I know that doesn't read well, but it might be killing the replayability of this game for me. But that was after ~30 plays, so....

I've definitely reached the point where I will never request this game again. I got a solid 30 plays out of it, and I'd play casually with others by request, but I'm basically finished with it.

A pretty good "automatic pilot" game. After getting some experience with this game, I pretty much know the general routes I want to build. I just read the card draft available to find out what order to work on them in and how to break them into shorter sections, if at all. From time to time an unsuitable card draw will force me into a different mode.

T&T is easy to teach and learn.  The "singularity" at Lodz adds a touch of spice to the play.  Sometimes the carriage card mechanism seems to rush the game to its end.  It's possibly too long to be a filler, but its weight justifies its length.

This one I like. The card selection reminds me of Ticket to Ride. The route-building reminds me (a little) of China, but that could just be the map layout and the regions. The decreasing-bonus-tile selection reminds me of something else, but I can't think what at the moment ... However ... The whole thing comes together very nicely. Admittedly, there's no way of blocking your opponents, as you can all share routes, and the only opportunity for any "screwage" comes from nabbing a tile before your opponent, or sweeping the display clean when you know there's a few cards there that your next opponent is after. I do like it though ....

RATING: 7.5
Players build routes through multiple cities by playing cards for each city; players get points for building longer routes, and near the end of the game must build long routes to get points.  While which city-cards are available adds luck to the gameplay, the game is very strategic/tactical as the scoring options allow for multiple methods to get points (building a long road, getting houses in each color, getting all the houses of one color, etc.), each of which takes planning and responsiveness to achieve.  There is no resource production, trading, auctions, or even currency in the game.  The one problem I can forsee is that near the end the game can devolve into a card-hunting game (wherein each player needs one card to win).

Not much more than a simple abstract game with a thin theme draped over it and a nice looking board. The biggest problem with the game (there are several) is there's no player interaction what so ever. It's like a four player game of solitaire with the luck of pulling the right card at the right moment having more to do with winning as anything else.

Only for people who like purely abstract games with a high luck factor. In the end there's nothing new or exciting here.

So it's one of the rare games in our collection that gets pulled out pretty regularly and played. I never really turn it down. It plays quickly, it's elegant, and fun and challenging. You can play it with new players, as it's very easy to pick up. 

Probably one of my top 10 games, and definitely standing the test of time.

I was new to the hobby and this was one of my first purchases that I made without knowing anything about it, but based on the award alone, and the fact that I really enjoyed Ticket to Ride, Settlers, and Carcassonne, also SdJ winners.  I was immediately underwhelmed when I got a chance to play.  Rating - 6.

It wasn't until a little while later when I played a 2-player game, and playing in online games, where I began to appreciate it more.  It was a tight little game.  Not genius, but pleasant, and with the feeling of a race to see who can most quickly raise up their carriage cards or place their post offices, since this is usually a good indication (but not surety) of the leader.  Now I'm glad that I kept it around since it fits nicely into its SdJ category -- a quick, lighter game for family and friends. Rating - 8. 

The expansion board of Power & Glory adds some more variety and flavor.  Most of the smaller expansions I could take or leave.  I don't think they add that much strategy.

RATING: 8
Thurn and Taxis has some very unique elements but does have a similar feel to other card drafting (set collection) games such as Ticket to Ride, Web of Power (aka China), Hacienda, and even Showmanager.  It is fairly light on strategy (which is why it appealed to the German Game of the Year voters), but offers enough agonizing decisions to keep things interesting.   Other than hoarding cards someone else needs, there is little you can do to slow down the leader.   Some might call it multi-player solitaire.  But that doesn't bother me, as I tend to enjoy many of those type of games (Princes of Florence being my favorite multi-player solitaire type of game).

RATING: 7
Theme is nicely woven into the game and the game play is tight.  Beautifully crafted artwork and components.  The concept is very easy to learn but the degree of strategy is enough to keep the synapses firing without becoming too overwhelming.  

Due to its rather quick play time, it can serve as a nice filler game after a grueling epic when you are looking to take it easy but still want a challenge.  Your actions have enough of an impact on other players to promote a healthy degree of interaction, but not too much to immerse you in politics or bantering.  So its a good way to strike a balance if coming out of a more competitive gaming session without swinging too far into the dry worker placement/resource management arena.

It's also a good game whether you play 2 players or four players.  In all, very well designed and executed.  Something I will always be happy to play and happy to own.

Good Light/Medium weight set collection, route building game.  About the same complexity as Carcassonne/Ticket to Ride, but allows for more long term strategy, as the goals are completely determined by the player (getting long routes, all colors bonus, gray area, etc.) and not by a card draw.  Replayability can suffer once players find the optimum strategy, but the cards add enough randomness to keep things interesting.

RATING: 5
Moderately enjoyable game with nice graphics. I think its less accessible to non-gamers than TtR but probably a good transition from there towards more complex gaming. The game play is mostly tactical and a bit dull as it's mainly just waiting for the appearance of that critical card you need to complete a route. Player interaction is pretty much limited to the "Administrator" role, hence the frequent use of the apt metaphor "multiplayer solitaire" by other BGGers to describe T&T. 

The amount of times I've played this game is no reflection of how much I enjoy it. It just seems the be a game that is usually available and the lowest common denominator after everyone decides on what not to play. In fact, T&T is probably the personification of why dull Eurogames do so well among anonymous gamers - you just play "among" (ie solitaire) other gamers with an inoffensive ruleset without risking (and failing) on any real personal interaction with other people.

Small note: I have seen one session of this game go for 3 hours! A small preview of hell!

Everybody seems to compare it to Ticket To Ride, but I think the comparison only holds up for the card draw mechanism, and even that is not exactly the same.  The theme is maybe a bit similar, but for the rest, the way you place your branches, and more importantly how you score requires much more attention.  Overall, it's a rather quick game that feels fun and challenging, but unfortunately does not have any real direct player interaction.  Good game, but for me not the Spiel des Jahres 2006...  

Oh and plays very well with 2 and with 4.  Of course it's a lot harder with 4 than with 2, obviously as there are more people contesting the same bonus tiles.  With 2 it's more a race, with 4 it's more a struggle ;-)

Acquired July 25th, 2008 - New

I can see how this one was the SDJ winner.  The whole postal route theme - delivering mail - works as it is unique.  Like the fact you can either play pieces in a region or 1 piece in each region.  It's set collection, and a race to see who can get bonuses and finish the victor!
I would like to get Power and Glory just for the extra "map".  Don't know if I like P&G's rule of using the cards to be the new carriage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A decent game... certainly reminiscent of Ticket To Ride. Limited experience with this so far but I can't help but call this a slightly more thoughtful but solitary version of TtR. In TtR you have tickets basically mandating where you need to place your trains... and you need to deal with others getting in your way and come up with plan B and C quite often. In Thurn & Taxis you can basically set a plan in action according to your cards and yes you have the other players swooping in to pick up the bonus chits before you can reach them but all in all it's like a race where everyone is doing their own thing and the interaction level doesn't feel quite as strong as in TtR. The blocking action in Thurn & Taxis is also not really a factor. Both games have luck of the draw issues and that can likely be mitigated a bit more in T&T which is why I think it's the slightly more "advanced" game. I don't know if it's quite as interesting or fun as TtR though which in the end is what makes or breaks a game. For now I'm giving this a 6.5 and hopefully with more plays this may rise up above that level but I still think TtR is the better bang in this particular genre. I must say I can't really see why this game would win SdJ after seeing how similar in concept it is to TtR yet lacks the overall spark of that game. Oh well... to each their own.

Overall comment: a quick playing "card" game that has simple game elements and lightweight decisions to make.  Good game to play with new game playing adults.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor): 10 (gorgeous board and cards)
Family rating: 7 (take it or leave it - marginal)
Game group: N/A (brought many times but passed over so far due to the "simple" elements, new players have found it interesting)
AP: 10 (one of the best things about this game - no AP)
Solo play: 9 (more strategic than the normal play and figuring which goal to shoot for makes it interesting and more replayable)

When purchased: 2006
Luck factor(1-10 high): 5
Recommend expansions: no
Age range: 8+

Reason purchased: Geek analysis (bridge game for family)

Pros: plays quick, decisions are simple, it is easy to follow what others are doing and the goals are easy to understand with close game scores
Cons: no variation between games

Recommendation: perhaps a guilty pleasure in a complex game world. I don't mind playing this one anytime.  Works well with new adults.
Replayability: Below average
Game value (play/cost ratio): Average

Themed after the 19th century German postal system, one attempts to establish postal houses in all areas of Germany. A player drafts cards into their hand, plays them down to form a route, then play down postal houses on the route, either all in one province, or one in each of the provinces. Being able to form postal houses in all provinces, or all in one province earns VP chits for that player, and VPs decrease for the next player. One also earns VPs for the length of their routes. It is a race to finish, and players can use one of 4 special abilities per turn to aid them. It's a fun game. The mechanics are not new, but they are blended together to form a good game.

I enjoy this quite a bit. It feels like a cross between TtR and Funkenschlag, a bit more strategic than TTR and less luck-prone, but still a good family game that plays under an hour and is extremely easy to explain. There might not be an abundance of interactive elements in the game, but sucess does require a player to keep a close eye on the point scoring by the other players, and an ability to make some tactical changes based on that. For me the game does not fulfill the criteria of multiplayer solitaire. The map is a bit fuzzy and the road system should be more clearly marked, now diluted by the cities.

Impression after 1 play - a decent game, but I wouldn't say it's great. Definitely feels like a mixture of T2R and Web of Power, but I think I prefer Web of Power because it allows a little bit more flexibility to players(cards depicting regions instead of each city). I understand that, in order to play well, you have to pay attention to other players, which guarantees a certain level of player interaction. That said, you-have-to-pay-attention-to-others-kind of player interaction is usually not thrilling enough to me. Guess I am too lazy to do that.

Perhaps as a base game less variable than it might be from game to game, yet this walks the line between planning and ease of play brilliantly.

I prefer heavy games, but this is my preferred "light" game so far. Much better than other more appreciated "light" games here on BGG (surely better than Ticket to Ride, just to make an example). Even better than Carcassone, the game that I used to propose to non gamers. Even heavy gamers can like it, since there are many different paths to victory and it is possible to have your own personal path to victory. There is luck, but less decisive than some critiques let intend (I think at least 90 % of the games the strongest player wins). I don't agree that it seems a multi player solitaire and that there is no interaction at all. The key point of the game is timing and a player can decide the length of the game in many different ways... so the timing itself is the interaction, and it is not a small one, IMHO.

UPDATE January 2009
I like the game less lately. And, even without considering the heavy games that I prefer, there are better light games that appeared lately which I would prefer to play (i.e. Dominion, Giants, Steel Driver).

UPDATE
After the appearance of Hansa Teutonica I think it is very unlikely that I will play this game again. So rating further decreased.

After the appearance of games like Terra Mystica or The Great Zimbabwe my wish to play this game is further decreased.

One of my favorite light weight games, but in the end it is too light weight for my taste. After 10 plays everything goes on autopilot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The theme of the game is as boring as it can get, fortunately is paper-envelope-thin, so what you got is players trying to get longer and longer city connections by flirting with risk and time, since a leader can trigger the ending turn without one being ready for it.

Though somewhat entertaining and quick to play, the game was not enticing enough for me to actually choose it before others of similar weight and playtime.

Only played once so far.  Solid gameplay, good game, but if I'm reaching for a game like this, I'm probably hitting Ticket to Ride as Thurn and Taxis is a bit more to take on.  If I want deeper than TTR, then I'm probably reaching a lot deeper: into the Puerto Rico-style games and so Thurn and Taxis gets skipped.  Fans of TTR that want a little more depth should like this game.

Lighter and faster than Ticket to Ride, with card hoarding eliminated. Overall I prefer this one.

RATING: 7
Set collection mechanic similar to ticket to ride. You need to build routes on the board, but you can only be building one at a time. Each time you score a route, your next route needs to be longer in able to score. You need to know when to try and get points and when to try and build a bigger route to trigger end game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.35
Nice card game with a bit drafting, set collection, network building and push your luck.

The game is easy to teach/learn and play, much more strategic than tactic.

IMHO, its main drawback its the AP. It's not unbearable, but it's certainly excessive for a game that is not deep.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A solid good game. There isn't much of a player interaction.

Update (16.12.2007): T&T is a good game but after playing it with the first expansion, I think that is how it should've been originally designed with double purpose city/horse cards. I now rate base game as a 7 and 1. expansion as a 9.

Held off buying this game for quite awhile to get through the initial hype, but once I finally caved and played it I realized my error. This is like an advanced, extremely tactical version of Ticket to Ride. I enjoy it quite a bit.

RATING: 5.5
Ticket to ride in the land of Web of Power, with a light role selection: nothing new or original, but works perfectly. A little bit too much of formatized game for das Spiel des Jahres, which is becoming to be boring in this period...
Interesting at the beginning, it feels a bit repetitive after a few plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A good game with lots of interesting choices. I just wish it had more there in terms of thwarting other players. Essentially this is a "race" game, or to put it better a series of races. Players are rewarded for best & quickest ways to achieve dominance within the board's given areas. It is, however, a very playable game that is worth the 45-60 minutes one puts into it. I like it a lot, but do not love it.

Rather light board game that is fun to play. There are various strategies available but above all this is a tactical game. The theme is good but feels a bit pasted on. Thurn und Taxis works very well with just two players. Cards are too small to my taste but other components are really good!

RATING: 8
It's true that Thurn und Taxis doesn't offer up interaction (the closest is taking someone else's wished cards, or wiping the board clean of them) and it might be a Ticket to Ride upgrade. That said, the rules are still quite easy to explain (the game gets more complicated than it would seem at first, of course), the pace is still quick for a German game and there are enough different goals to scrap the necessary points to win if you're trailing, so the game doesn't suffer from dips in intensity or overlength. It's not the right choice if cutthroat playing is wished - but an ideal family game.

RATING: 6.4
Mi aspettavo qualcosa di pi√π, un gioco meno semplice e banalotto, ma mi sbagliavo. Questo non toglie che Thurn und Taxis √® un gioco giocabilissimo, fluido, piacevole, ma alla lunga ripetitivo e poco profondo. Un buon riempitivo dalla durata contenuta. Poca interazione e componente fortuita abbastanza presente.

RATING: 7.5
An effortlessly fluent, good-looking and enchanting game with deceptively simple rules and gameplay. Much better player interaction than the similar but inferior Ticket To Ride, and a hefty dose of mid-distance strategy which doesn't often appear in a game this light. T&T is very much one of those graceful games which can occupy a spot in anyone's collection and play the part of quick filler or main-eventer as required.

RATING: 7.4
At my first games I impressed from this game's simplicity and fun and give it 7.8 points. However I decreased its point from 7.8 to 7.5 after losing several games aganist my brother Orcun and friend Serhan (I generally beat them in other games) because of high luck effect on last games. I cannot even make my strategy well because I cannot predict which cards will show up next. I make a strategy but the card I need do not show up even I make administrator and change all cards. So you do not have to take risk in that game but you cannot make high scores without taking risks if you have not started game well. Game start is also effected by luck. Generally it is a well designed good and fun game with high replayibility but it has less and luck-effected strategy so I give it a 7.5

[b]Thurn and Taxis[/b] 

[i]I was really interested in trying it out since there are definitely some gamers that prefer this over TTR (which is a game I love).

Well Joel was right, I played a game with my two older kids and we weren't impressed. [-]I really didn't like the hand management aspect of the game (every time you finished a route you lost your cards), that pretty much killed the game for me.[/-] (I found out I was playing the game wrong, you only discard down to 3 cards). As others have noted, I felt that the game really pushed you to get your 7 carriage as quickly as possible, making the game somewhat one dimensional.[/i]

(19/05/06) Na Torres deze Thurn and Taxis gespeeld.  Een kompleet ander spel, met een mooi maar minder praktisch spelbord. Het is de bedoeling om met een postkoets een trajekt af te leggen.  Dit doe je door, zoals in Ticket to Ride, door kaartjes te nemen.  In dit spel ben je verplicht 1 kaart aan je trajekt af te leggen, wat voor extra spanning zorgt.  Het vervelende aan dit spelbord is dat alle namen van steden in 1 richting staan afgeprint.  Ik heb het spel 'ondersteboven' gespeeld, en het was niet altijd even makkelijk om zo het ideale trajekt uit te stippelen.  Speelden mee: Geert, Katrien, Ann en ikzelf.

Close observance of player pick up and avoidance of those areas seems to be the key, combined with good luck in getting cards in not-those-areas. The scoring seems to be overly weighted towards who gets luckier earlier in the game. But it's a neat and simple premise - pick up cards, form chains, score. And that can be attractive if you're looking for a 30-40 minute lightish affair with plenty to react to.

All this said, it is a very light game and there is a lot of luck. I would find it difficult to say you can become a pro at Thurn, since you have to hope your cards come out and if they don%u2019t well, it will cost you wasted turns. Also, some might be frustrated that the decisions they make have little effect on the other players and that the game seems like a race with too much luck. I cannot really argue with that, but for a light simple game, everyone I played with enjoyed it. Sometimes it is just nice to play something that does not cause too much brain drain, yet still involves enough strategy to prevent it from being simply a %u201Clucky player wins all the time%u201D type of game. This is a nice family game that can be enjoyed by hard core players as well, but I would not necessarily recommend it to those who only like pure strategy games and mock any aspect of luck. All in all, a nice addition to my collection.

This gets compared to Ticket to Ride more than it should.  It shares the card drafting aspect somewhat, but the card play itself is quite different.  Hand management in this game is much trickier, but the tension of getting blocked is replaced by a race type tension.  Thurn and Taxis can be described as a hand management puzzle race whereas Ticket to Ride has a much stronger element of keeping your opponents from completing their goals while you advance yours, though Thurn and Taxis has some of this as well.  Though Ticket to Ride is vastly more popular, both games have aged extremely well.

Well, it's got a bit more going on than China.  And the help of the postal officials is the highlight of the game, allowing one to tune one's action based on current needs.  Alas, this is not enough to make it much more than a pedestrian card-cycling game.  Although, I like the current trend of T&T and TtR: Marklin of stacking VP markers for players to collect.

For me, this game is all about optimization than anything else.  You really want to get a new carriage card with each route, and get to the 7 carriage as soon as possible.  It gets a little monotonous after a while (especially with extremely little player interaction), but it's still a fun light game.

Gameplay works fairly well, and there are a couple of different strategies that people can pursue which keeps the game interesting. Plays fairly well with non-gamers, although the theme (18th C German post offices) is  bit turgid for my liking.

Played this again after many years. OK, seems like my wiew on what makes a good game has changed over time... I downgrade this to a "6"

***

Edit: Downgrading it to a "7"

Thurn und Taxis is a beautiful game with simple but a bit unintuitive rules. Not really an exciting game, it has more of a "quiet" quality to it. I loved this game initially, but replayability is not so good. Still, I give it a play once in a while. Works best with 2 or 3 players. My oldest daughter start playing this at 8 years of age.

RATING: 7.5
I love map games, so like this one as well.  While a gateway game, still has interesting play and choices.  I feel there's more competition vs TTR, which people may compare it to.

Thematically, it bugs me when you lay out your route, you can only place in the same color or one in each color, rather than the route.  It's needed mechanically, however annoying thematically and if you're a TTR player.

I might rate this higher later, because the game is quite genuinely fun, but so far, I've won every game I've played on BSW, even my first time ever playing. Once I find a player who can actually show me some better tactics, I will gladly give this game the extra point I think it deserves.

RATING: 7
Good game that plays well with all 2-4 players.  There seem to be a few different strategies that work well, but you're also at the mercy of the cards available so you need to be flexible.  A great combination of set-collection/racing mechanics.  The game looks awesome too.

Some friends taught this to us in Dec 2010 as a 4 player game. They said it worked better with 4 than with 2, but they still like it okay with 2. I thought it was really fun with 4. It has some similarities to Ticket to Ride, but there was more going on and more to pay attention to, which was kind of nice. And we couldn't block each other like in TTR. Not quite as easy to learn and set up as TTR though.

I slightly prefer Ticket to Ride, but Thurn and Taxis is a decent gateway game.

I've played twice with different gamers and I enjoyed it but they could take it or leave it. The casual gamer may find this game rather uninteresting.  You crisscross medieval Germany on an elegant but dreary board and your moves don't directly affect the other players. I think it would get more interesting with more plays, but those I've played with so far won't give it a 2nd chance, so I'll be playing it solitaire I guess.

I've played this game at a local board game meetup. I feel the cards are pretty balanced to have 3 cards for each city in the deck. I was fearing that I'd not be able to build any more routes and thus has to discard my present tableau without being able to score. Luckily, it didn't happen in the game that I played. 
The end game condition also makes it an interesting game. I have a feeling that rushing the carriages won't help me and it didn't because I didn't have enough bonus tiles to compete for the end game.
I don't really feel like there is too much of a player interaction there. I know you can wipe the board to hurt a player, but you don't know if it will either.

Another turn off for me is the Cities name are all foreign to me but I am sure repeated plays will make it easier. It is color coded so that makes it a bit easier to manage.

It's a good game, but I don't know if I will own one or not.

RATING: 8
A fun game in the vein of Ticket to Ride but far less luck-driven.  The card draws provide a bit of luck, and an occasional clearing of the cards provides some chaos.  There is a healthy amount of player interaction, but it's long-term rather than short-term, as each player races to end the game or to grab chips before the others.  It seems that multiple plays provide more strategic and tactical insight, but I anticipate that multiple plays may bore me.  This evaluation and rating is based on one play, and I would enjoy playing it again, though I may burn out after 5 or so plays.

Playing the base game often online has now cemented my impression: it is like a jigsaw puzzle (with beautiful map art) which is ideally (i.e. efficiently) made from 5 pieces of increasing sizes (3,4,5,6 and 7 spots) but with the little wrinkle being there will be at least 2 spots missing from the puzzle.

The wrinkle doesn't bother me, the almost restrictive reward of putting down the pieces in size order starts to (you can build say 5 then 5 size etc but only get points for a 3 and 4 size).

The puzzlement continues with the strange and counterintuitive placement on the spots which causes the piece you are putting down to morph or flip flop from one formation to another, your choice influenced by how much vp you will get when you claim certain spots. Admittedly this is the interesting part of the game....

The pieces are made of strings of connected routes, players interacting by weaving the same routes so the race is for finishing quickly as there is a vp countdown in value for different regions on the board.(Exciting stuff). 

But now comes the bad vibe part: sometimes there is a relationship test when you may blatantly taking 1 or 2 cards or scrap the display that would cap an end part of your opponents route. This may have a knock-on effect on your opponent which may cause all the hard decision work of building the route to be dismantled if they can't find on their turn the same or alternative card. I feel the route won't be the only thing that will break down.....

It is this restrictive building of the routes which can make or break the game. Like I said earlier it is like building a jigsaw where doing it in size sequencing made reap better rewards, but at times it is like wearing a straitjacket too, not a challenge I enjoy and can really only play with the Messenger expansion as it loosens the buckles a bit and provides some hope.

Finally a game by Seyfarth. Decent enough lighter game and nothing in the Puerto Rico class. You create routes from one city to another, passing throug a variable number of cities. All of your victory ponts come from the length of routes you make and how fast you get to visit all the cities in a regions. There is a mechanic here similar to Ticket to Ride: Marklin, where the earlier arrivals to certain regions get to pick up higher-numbered victroy point tokens. 

Some strategies and tension since it is a race game after all, but there are lots of chaos and luck of the draw. Overall a light game to play once in a while.

It has elements of both Web of Power and Ticket to Ride. There are more choices confronting the player than in any of the Ticket games. However, it would be easier to introduce any of the Ticket games to non-gamers than trying to explain Taxis. It plays quickly and is much better than any filler but is something less than a full blown game. Very enjoyable. Note: this is the most awful color selection for a board since Magna Gracia...for we who are color challengd (colorblind) playing is a bitch.

A quick playing and simple route building game. In this game you draw cards and place them in front of you so that they reflect a chain of towns on the board. Then, when you feel good about your chain, you score it and place houses in one of two patterns depending on your strategy. There are also those Feldian point bonuses for the first player to score a length or complete area, where the first player to do the thing gets the highest value chip at the top of the pile. Very cute, but the dry graphic design kept this from the table, and other games overshadow it in it's slot.

Thurn & Taxis has the same face-up/face-down card drawing as Ticket to Ride but feels more different to it than I expected. There's no set collection and you're not really building a network. As a result, I don't think it's nearly as good as TTR as a non-gamers' game, but I did enjoy my two 2-player games and am interested to try it with more.

We played this once, then forgot about it. After a long pause, we played it again a few times and it is growing on us. 

If you like this one, get the expansion Power and Glory as well. If you don't like the rule changes for it, you may play the new map with the old rules.

Interesting and somewhat novel mechanics of sequencing the cards and satisfying the various bonus point conditions. However, the game broke down and lost its strategic element once players began clearing the card display frequently as this prevented any sort of planning and left me with too much down time waiting to react to whatever the board offered on my turn.

RATING: 8
A superior game of about the complexity of Hansa. It has a bit of TtR flavor in the card drawing and placement. Both strategy (optimizing the bonus tiles) and luck (draw of the cards) are well balanced. Except for poaching a card needed by another player (which isn't a good plan unless you need that card, thereby it is no longer poaching...) there is no opportunity for screwage. There is a race to score the various bonus tiles as early as possible though. Better be prepared to get the 7 carriage on the last turn. Use of the Cartwright special option is essential to this task (as others will be using it). Work in 'radial' lines, from the outer areas into Baiern, to acquire the bonus chips while placing houses in the multiple provice mode. Filling in Baiern first is a loser.

Another Spiel de Jahres winner, T&T is a postal network building game for 3-4 players.

First impression of the game was a good one. We were expecting a remake of Ticket to Ride and we got something more profound than we expected of a Spiel des Jahres winner. There is a little interaction between players has you can discard the face up cards that are worthwhile to you opponents. You can also try to complete routes before you opponents to take the highest scoring markers. You have to make good usage of the caracters to help you complete routes before your opponents.
I repeat, good first impression.
Can't wait to try T&T Power and Glory

La premi√®re impression de ce jeu a √©t√© tr√®s bonne. On s'attendait √† un ''remake'' de Tiket to Ride et nous avons d√©couvert un jeu avec une plus grande profondeur que nous nous attendions d'un gagant du Spiel des Jahres. Il y a un peu d'interaction entre les joueurs car vous pouvez discarter les cartes ouvertes qui sont favorables a vos adversaires. Vous pouvez √©galement tenter de fermer des routes avant vos opposants afin d'obtenir les marqueurs de victoires les plus √©lev√©s. Vous devez faire bon usage des personnages afin de vous aider √† fermer des routes.
Je le r√©p√®te, bonne premi√®re impression.

A Frankenstein's Monster of a game.  Take a little bit of Web of Power (province control), a dash of Ticket to Ride (draw card, play card, accumulate cards, eventually meld a set), city connectivity, any game (including wargames) with upgrade processes (sort of like train upgrades in Puffin' Billy games), and you get a game that screams "I want to be considered for SdJ!"  And it might just be, due to the monumental snub of Puerto Rico.  Personally, it just didn't really do a ton for me and that might have a lot to do with the artwork and the "Web of Power" look to it--which will always give me the heeby jeebies.

A game I've gotten rid of twice because there was something compelling about it. It was somewhat reminiscent of Ticket to Ride without the ability to hoard cards, but the game itself just can't distinguish itself from the multitude of things out there that either offer more gripping gameplay, prompt more laughter, or are easier to explain. I enjoyed my time with this one, but it was merely OK.

Thurn and Taxis is an easy game to learn and play, and can be completed in under an hour. There are some interesting choices to be made (which role do I choose, which card do I take, when do I cash a route, where do I put my station houses). My one major complaint is that the carriage cards seem to be tacked on. It feels like Andreas Seyfarth put them in the game just to create one more way to score points.

11/08/2007: The last game which I played during the recent boardgaming session, I rather enjoyed Thurn and Taxis because of the route-planning and player power mechanics, and the choices which compel players to lay down routes of different length, such as the lure of extra victory points for having an office in each coloured district or in all cities within a district.

A very light 'train' game with an interesting take on victory points. There is a solid mixture of luck and strategy in here. The game plays much quicker than most similar games. I like the artwork on the board although it makes it hard to see towns and routes for people who are visually impaired.

Thurn and Taxis is decent enough. Simple, straightforward. I think the theming is neatly quirky while not really attached to the gameplay. The decisions aren't weighty, but there's times when that's fine with me. 

My game includes the Der Kurier der F√ºrstin expansion which adds a few elements to the game that enhances your options a bit, but doesn't ultimately change it too much. Nice to have. Will probably always play with it now.

This game was enjoyable, entertaining and deceiving.  It seems simple enough.  You are trying to score by creating routes, with each route becoming increasingly longer.  You take two actions.  The first is to draw a city card.  The second action can be one of several actions, draw a second city card, play two city cards from your hand, choose a specialist to help you finish your route.  There are bonus points by completing whole colors.

This is an easy game to learn, and may interest those who liked Ticket to Ride and want something a bit more elaborate, with a wider variety of scoring options.
On the other hand, I felt a little bit let down by this game, specially by its almost non-existing flavor (what is it about again?), and its quite-steep learning curve: make no mistake, it may be easy to learn the rules, but it has an intricate hidden mechanism that will punish you for not planning your moves well ahead.
After a few games, you start to get the hang of it, and it becomes a lot more fun.

This was a game that I have had an eye on for a while and finally got a chance to play it. I enjoyed it immensely and will probably pick it up (even though I came in last).The choices of how to pick your routes is key to this game, as well as an understanding of when to place a house in each region you touch or in all cities in one region. I also like the fact that you cannot change the order of your rout once it is on the table.

Made some bad plays and didn't realize some things unil too late. Then I had no idea that I wouldn't get another turn. A fustrating play, but I still like the game.

Found it fun and enjoyable, with enough to keep you thinking of your next move, and working on medium term strategies. The gameplay is elegant, and the components are beautifully illustrated. We've played several games of it and would get it out to play again.
I'd be interested to compare this with 'Ticket to Ride', since I've read that this is a little deeper, but with not quite so much 'conflict'.

RATING: 5
Interesting Mechanics, Good production in the Bits, but it is yet another game where one must make the best play this turn, not having much ability to plan ahead to one's next turn.  Easy to fall of the leader's pace and hard to overtake the leader.  The rule mandating a player with no cities in play must "choose to draw two" turned out to be more of a prison wall than the hurdle it is made out to be.  Wouldn't want be the person in charge of teaching it to new folks

Oh route marker games - I play them so badly (such as Union Pacific) only to suddenly come up trumps after a year or so between first and second games. That's the reason I'm not rating T&T as I LOATHED my first game. I think it was more to do with thinking a bit too far ahead rather than any fundamentally wrong with the mechanics. 

UPDATE: I think this has far more in common with Alhambra that TtR: fairly obvious choices with open cards, but disturbed by the fact previous players can take or wipe everything you want - so think one turn at a time. I did this and really enjoyed my second and third games. Still not a lot to think about, but it is very quick.

Have you ever wished you could build a postal empire in renaissance Germany? [i]Well now you can![/i] In Thurn and Taxis you will be doing that very thing! Now, the theme isn't exactly fascinating, but the game play is. The art is rather lovely hand drawn depictions of towns and various places of interest in Germany, but it is somewhat minimalist (you may like that) and fairly screams Euro, cause' this is a Euro. Collect cards to build routes, build larger routes, get bonuses, bonuses and routes equal points, all the while improving your transportation infrastructure and getting better mail carriages. It doesn't [i]sound[/i] fun, but it is, I promise.

When we first got this game, I was bit skeptical about it because while researching Govind came across sentences such as ,"This is another TTR". Because of this, I was under the impression that it is going to be a gateway game and I might not enjoy it. While we were unboxing the game, I found some cards to be similar to those of Trambahn which is one game I absolutely can not stand. So all in all, I had very low expectations from the game. 
However, after playing the game, I was never more happy to be proven wrong. This game is a gem and I am surprised how many people don't talk about it. 

Reasons I love the game:
1) Building a network of post offices through connecting routes give me a hands on feeling of being involved. I find it very thematic and engaging.
2) 4 special abilities make sure that there is always extra to be done in your turn. It is not a simple 'take a card, play a card' mechanic.
3) Although gameplay is very simple, the game has considerable depth. Just to plan and get the best possible route while installing as many post offices as possible is pretty deep.
4) Healthy competition. The game fosters healthy competition where you are competing with other player to get area bonus and multiple other bonus. At the same time, you never intentionally hurt your opponent.
5) Art and component quality. Classy artwork accompanied by good quality components. Linen finish on the cards make gameplay experience super awesome.
6) Germany's early modern map make it really fun to try and read the names aloud. And as a history buff, the theme appeals to me on a personal level.

All in all, an awesome game which Govind and I can play again and again.

Thurn and Taxis took me a while to figure out because I was expecting it to be more like Ticket to Ride than it actually was.  I think there are a few similarities to Ticket to Ride but there is a lot more tension in Thurn and Taxis because of the suspense about whether or not you will get the tickets you are looking for.  I do think that there is a bit more luck in Thurn and Taxis since once you start a route there are a few specific cards you need in order to complete your route.  Ticket to Ride is more flexible but less tense.

A fun game, fairly lightweight, reminds me of Ticket to Ride. I originally thought it was somewhat deeper than Ticket, but I've found that while it has more tactical decisions, it lacks Ticket's opportunities for long-term strategy. It could also use more player interaction; except for the races to claim the best prizes, it's largely multi-player solitaire.

Initial thoughts: nice gameplay, easy mechanics to learn.  Good solid game.  I like the various bonuses that are available....which will usually determine who wins the game.  Although they are a bit fiddly, they are clear enough and give you something to aim at.

To me it doesn't have as much appeal as Ticket to Ride but I enjoy the game and would play at any time.

Frankly, the name was the biggest put-off for me.  I knew nothing of the Thurn and Taxis history so the name was not appealing.  But I suppose that is more of a personal problem....and I did appreciate the effort to teach some meaningful history as part of the game documentation.

Wonderful, well designed game.  Kind of a mixture of Ticket to Ride & Castles of Burgundy.

Postal route building game with a race element, as the first player to complete an objective will always gain the most victory points. Intelligent use of a limited "enhancement" each turn -- to gain an extra card, play an extra card, replace cards, etc. -- is key in winning. Once a strategy is pursued, aggressive opponents can thwart you at the cost of delaying their own strategy, as with Ticket to Ride, or you could simply be blocked by the right cards not being drawn.

When I first bought this years ago, I didn't really get the game.  I've since played a lot online and now love it.  The network-creation and the victory points make it an abstract game with a pretty loose theme, but the components and artwork are beautiful.  I enjoy all those city names and the various strategies for winning, and there's the luck element of the cards making it not just a strategic game.  Player interaction is mostly just trying to take cards someone else might want, or clearing them away.

Played once. But this first time the game felt good. Balancing between focussing on the city you really want to visit and just make sure you get long routes. Keeping an eye on the cards you may need for your next route or even the cards your opponent needs. There seems to be a lot to it. But I reckon that when the right cards just don't turn up ...

Secret Santa 2009-  Really enjoyed this game despite getting crushed x 2.  Has a bit of a train game feel.  Rivals ticket to ride in complexity however, i think this has a much more interesting tactical aspect to it and a real sense of tension at the end because it seems to draw quickly. A  card game that has individual area control or which you reward more for controlling first.

Good game.  My biggest gripe is if a mistake is made, the only way you can catch up is if the people ahead makes a mistake as well.

8-12-11 Update: Actually beginning to not find this game fun at all.  Even while looking at my opponents route and occasionally taking a card she needed, it just isn't all that fun.  There just isn't much interaction and it really feels like solitaire.  Not what I'm looking for in a two player game.

8-26-12 Update:  Found out we've been scoring this game all wrong.  You only score your largest carriage not all of them and you subtract the number of posts you have left.  Guess this is what you get when you rely on someone to teach you the game and don't read the rules for yourself...its become a fun game again.

A bit Monopoly, a bit a card game, a lot of fun.
Choose the right way to ride just to place your post office in a new town in the old Germany and nearby country.

RATING: 6
A racing game. Players compete for points by achieving objectives as early as possible. The earlier the objective is achieved, the more points it is worth.

Outside of this, players rarely affect one another. It's just passive-aggressive jockeying to occupy certain positions on the board.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Update(8/08): I enjoy the various ways to go about getting victory points as well as using the administrators to help out at key moments. The tension and risk factor of possibly having to start over on a route is present but not nearly as heart pounding as Ticket to Ride. I think I prefer Ticket over Thurn

Easy to teach, yet lots of nice decisions in the game make for some great play.  From the game descriptions, feels like the game has many parts in common with parts of other games (place stations like Web of Power, clear the board like Atlantic Star, wipe out routes if cards can't be played like Space Beans) - but they all work very well together in this game.  Enjoyable, very enjoyable from the first play.

RATING: 5
Rather Ticket to Ride-ish, without the tension that game generates towards the end, and with even fewer opportunities to interfere with your opponents. As with Seyfarth's Puerto Rico, it's a rather 'multi-player solitaire' experience, with moreover the 'burn all the cards' option leaving matters too much to chance. I would expect this rating to go down with further plays.

Great game - not quite as good at Ticket to Ride, which it is commonly compared, but I think I like T&T a little better for 2 player.  If this was redone with a more familiar US map, I think it would become one of the main Gateway games on this side of the pond. I think it works even better as a gateway into traditional eurogames, in that there are different pathways to victory and you have to be faster than another player using a similar strategy.

Interesting mix of Ticket to Ride and China. I am not sure I like it as well as either of those two games. It's a good game. I can't say anything I "dislike" about it. There isn't anything I particularly "like" about it either. It seems like a good step up the ladder in the gateway game arena.

I enjoyed this route building game.  This was surprisingly simple and after everyone's first turn, we all felt comfortable with the rules.  The actions granted by the four personalities kept me from feeling like drawing out a route was impossible.   Routes were easy to build and it wasn't even hard to direct the routes where you wanted them.  The turn order during the turn in which someone initiates the end game bothered me (even though I wasn't screwed by it), but perhaps that can be chalked up to the first time playing this one.  I would definitely like to see it hit the table again...  I imagine the rating will go up.

RATING: 7
Light game. Reminds me of Ticket to Ride with less interaction. That's probably my biggest gripe with the game. The only interaction comes from a race to get certain points.

Still, considering how simple it is to learn, there's enough strategy going on to make it interesting and could be a great gateway game.

Not convinced yet that this is a great game. I have only played one three-player game and one two-player game so far so this might get a better rating after more plays. It just seems that there aren't that many decisions to be made and that there's only one path to pursue. I have to play the 4-player version and we'll see. There probably is more of a race for the victory tokens then. ---- Definately better with four. Depends quite a lot on cards so there's a family aspect to it. Still in the long run I think that good players will win more often. ---- Played another four player game and this game grows on you. Simple yet engaging.Played a couple of games yet again. ---- Increased rating from 8,5 to 9. I like it.

I can see why people describe it as multi-player solitare.  There isn't much you can do to block the plans of the other person, other than picking the station master and clearing the cards.

not very accessible Light Euro 

Ah, another instant keeper (along with Ingenious and Elfenland--one played turn and I knew I'd buy and love them) where my skill matters not one whit. I get distracted by all of the shiny things I can do, and I end up being too slow.

I love to bring this one out to non-gamers, just to shock them with its theme...yes, and one of my most delightful games is a simulation of the historical progress of the German Postal System. Apparently Lodz was essential! (meet their eyes, embrace the silence, wait for them to back away) Especially good if you aren't in the mood to teach another game at that time. A slightly more challenging SdJ: Even people who want to play this usually take a game to adjust to the (not immediately obvious) pacing required to score well.

feels round and soft. Love the monocolour browns, they lull me into a smi-conscious state of colors and German names, as the cards slide and tiles click, and my little green houses spread around the board in a leisurely fashion. And my wife wins.

RATING: 7.5
Thurn and Taxis is an area control game with route building via a card drafting mechanic.  No two games play the same, and there is more than one strategy that will secure enough victory points to win the game.  On their turn players add at least one card to their hand representing cities on the board.  They then must play one card representing a route.  They may only play a card they do not have in their route, and the card must be adjacent to one of the cities on the two endpoints of their route.  Players may then score their route which allows them to place houses in cities (from their route) either one in each of the regions in your route, or all of the cities in one region in your route.

Victory points are awarded for routes 5 or more cities in length, and for have houses in all cities of a given region.  The first person to do this gets more points than the rest, and eventually it's not worth anything.  At the end of the game any unplaced houses count against you, so the players need to balance the pace of the game and try not to let it end while they have a deficit of points.

The tension in the game comes from trying to be first to capture points, but also maintaining your route, because if you cannot add to your route you lose it.  All decisions in the game are strategic but not unforgiving of mistakes.

This is one of my favorite game night ender games.  There's some thought involved, but it also can be viewed as a nice light solitaire game.

It supports varied strategies to win, and does require the ability to pay attention to what everyone else is doing to play it well, however it still plays OK for those people who don't pay attention on anyone else's turn -- and still plays fairly quickly.

With only small amounts of downtime, and the ability to play the game without paying attention to anyone else puts it, for me, as a stepping stone game.

A stepping stone game is one that is played after the gateway game, but before tackling some of the more complex games in our hobby.  A good one to teach after they've learned ticket to ride, or catan.

Somewhere along the line this found its way on my radar.  Found a like new copy on eBay and bought it blindly.  Have only played it 2 player and I kind of like it so far.  But haven't seen enough to make a hard core decision yet.  Would still like to see it with three or four players.

Not too heavy game that moves along at a decent pace and manages to play differently with each outing. At first you think there's not a lot of player interaction, until with subsequent playings you start to see the possibilities of jumping in before the others and claiming the higher victory point markers and occasionally claiming a city card just for blocking purposes. Just try grabbing all the Lodz city cards and see how the other players feel about it!
The game is fun with 2-4 players, although the competition is more fierce with four players competing for the four city cards in the deck - tends to lead to more card cycling actions being used to get the desired card.
If you're looking for a game easy on the rules, that's fun and with a fairly low level of meanness, then I can highly recommend this one.

It has a similar look and mechanic than [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/10]Elfenland[/url][/i], but upgraded.  It can also be compared with [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209]Ticket to Ride[/url][/i] because of the "pick up cards" mechanic.  Players try to build a postal network in Bayern and its surroundings with the help of postal officers.

At first glance, it looks similar to Ticket to Ride, until you play.  This game truly feels like a race as players, who represent postal companies in 18th century Germany, race to get their post offices and psotal routes established.  The unique mechanic of using the map of the game board as the rules of how one can play their cards, added to the fact one can break one rule per turn, make this a wonderful game.  The twist is that the fastest doesn't always mean first; players need to move slow enough to try and build as many post offices as possible, even if it means shorter routes, since VPs are subtracted for unbuilt offices.

A surprise gift from my girlfriend. It would seem her training is complete, and she passed. I wish there was a little more player interaction other than vying for bonus tiles and occasionally taking player's needed town card to screw with the next player. I do like, however, the route selection and alternate house placement rules. It gives you some things to think about. Plays pretty well and quick with two.

This one seems like it can go either way in terms of people's opinions, and after my initial play I could see why. It could be seen as not providing as obvious or fulfilling an objective as Ticket to Ride, for example (a game to which it is sometimes compared - although I think the two play quite differently). Enjoyment in this game comes from the tension of racing other players to grab the points (and sometimes particular city cards) on offer, and from trying to time your moves perfectly and sometimes push your luck a little. After playing it a couple of times I think this game was a worthwhile purchase and benefits from multiple plays to bring out the subtleties involved. I've only played it with 2 players so far but I'm looking forward to trying it with more.

I was initially repulsed by the lack of interaction in the game (No spatial blocking? You can take or flush the card your opponents want, but often at a heavy price), but then realized that for what it is, a network-optimization game, it is very elegant and tightly designed. You need to have a long-term plan at all times, and minimize inefficiencies. I like how two of the 4 characters represent efficiency while the other two represent inefficiency. 

View it as a puzzle game and the tight design really shines through.

TTR reworked as a MPS euro puzzle. Should be fine for those who like Alhambra. 

Route building is interesting, but with the scoring and whatnot there's so many things too juggle you won't look at what other players are doing. At all. Just what level of coach they have and that's it. Like BMC, this is a race, but closer to those of euro puzzle engines (it's not an engine, BUT your set collecting is pretty much tied to an excel spread sheet designer made up). And with all juggling that consumes your mind, it's hard to say it's ever rewarding or justified. I don't dislike it, I think the route building is a nice mechanic/feature which makes thematic sense, Bavaria is a good place to travel across by mind and as far as euro puzzles go at least it's not one of changing resources into other resources. 

Played this a few times too many with eurogamers and lost my taste for brown pastels and silent optimising.

Another light, basically fun, but apparently shallow game, on par with Web of Power, with the card drawing mechanics of Ticket to Ride. There is just about no tension, except when someone takes the card you wanted. Don't worry, it will come back up again in the deck, anyway.

At least it doesn't appear to be broken. There may be more depth to the game than there first appears.

2007: 8. Initially I wasn't sure about this game.  I loved the quality components, interesting theme and tactical euro play, but I thought the lack of player interaction would harm my overall opinion.  After several plays with my parents, I can definitely say this game has them hooked, and if it has *them* hooked, it must be good.

2014 UPDATE: 8. Continues to be popular with my parents, they are always up for a game. I think the semi-solitaire nature of the mechanics and lack of ability to stuff people up is really key for them.

2017 UPDATE: 8.5.  Have played the game online a few times now with proper competitive "gamer" players and I'm even more of a fan of the game now.  "Power and Glory" provides a tougher map, and I like the "Offices of Honor" module from the "All Roads Lead to Rome" which rewards you for spreading out your actions.

RATING: 7.5
Players draft and play 1-2 cards each turn to link cities. There are multiple ways of scoring linked cities (do you place a house in one city in each linked region or place a house in all cities in a single region). Hand management is crucial as players HAVE to draw AND place a route card each turn. If you're overly ambitious, you might have to end up discarding the ENTIRE route you've built so far. DOH. The pace of the game is driven by the players and one must be careful to keep up with the pack. Several potential flaws have been mentioned: it feels little solitaire-ish (but so's TTR) and it can drag if several players start taking too long calculating all the potential routes in their head. I think the sweet spot is 3 players.

UPDATE: A friend described this as Ticket to Ride without the 'meanness' of blocking people. I agree. Seyfarth has taken the TtR drafting of cards and given his spin on the game. There are no secret destinations: replaced by common pool of VP points for achieving goals first. Like TTR Marklin, there is a need to drop off your house early enough to get the higher point VP tokens. Also, one must learn to manage your hand (you're forced to discard down to 3 cards after completing routes) and plan several moves ahead.

Connection. Really like it after one play with 3p. Feels like a distant cousin to Ticket to Ride, maybe an older, more sophisticated cousin :) Actually quite simple rules, smooth playing. Low screwage factor, which is okay with me in this game. Looking forward to more plays.

EDIT: still rate it an 8 after some 4p games. I just need to try it out with 2p now!

EDIT: plays fine with 2p too. Solid game with 2-4 that plays in an hour.

Last Edit: after more plays, my enjoyment has dropped a little. Still a solid game, but after time now it just seems... a little dry, I guess. I think 7.5 is my final rating.

T&T is a lovely game, and it's an extremely clean system which nicely utilizes proven mechanisms. I feel as if I should really like it. But there's also almost zero player interaction, almost zero tension, almost zero excitement. It's one of those games, like TtR (to which it is frequently compared), in which players attempt to complete routes. Completing routes gets you little victory point bonuses, and your goal is to get as many of those bonuses as possible while trying to ensure that the game ends when you are in an ascendent position. The rules are elegant, but I just find the game ho-hum. There is nothing especially satisfying about playing it, although I'm happy to play it while carrying on a conversation. I tend to dislike "multiplayer solitaire" games in which you try to build something, and in which other players can only thwart your efforts in passive-aggressive ways - which describes T&T pretty well. The only way to mess with another player is to pick up cards you "think" she might want. This is the only real interaction in the game, and it's pretty weak - but I simply don't care for this sort of interaction. If there is a conflict of interests in a game, I like it to be more direct. In Tikal, you can take control (for scoring purposes) of someone else's ruins. In Lost Valley, you can obtain gold from a mine another player spent valuable resources to build. In Puerto Rico, you can take a role card desired by someone else - but it has a *major* impact on their plans. In T&T, taking a card someone else wants (if you guess correctly about that) is like pinching them, not knocking them out with a knuckle sandwich. My complaint does not arise from lack of appreciation for subtlety. I love subtlety, but let there be some deviousness, for crying out loud. I've meditated a bit on this game, and I think although I find the presentation beautiful, it just doesn't feel that much like a game to me. More of an activity. Even in Lord of the Rings, a cooperative game, there is a strong feeling of competition - against the Sauron-Knizia evil mastermind, aka The Game.

RATING: 3
Boring multiplayer solitaire without blocking and almost no player interaction. The routes you can build are dictated by the faceup city cards, so there are almost no meaningful decisions to be made. To complete a route you have to wait for the right city to show up, so there is a lot of luck involved. A 2-player game is a runaway leader race for the big point chits.

Thurn & Taxis is a good example that the "Spiel des Jahres" award doesn't mean anything. Ticket to Ride, which obviously "inspired" this game, is much better.

Update: can't get rid of this game since it sells for 1‚Ç¨ on ebay ... this sums up its quality quite well.

A fun enough game, with a little more going on than TtR.  There are some interesting ideas for how to achieve a good end game result.  It is apparent that one MUST watch the other players to see who has the ability to "go out" soon, and match their play, or they can be left sorely behind in the endgame.

We Await Silent Tristero's Empire.

This is a decent little puzzle, with about zero interaction.  Nothing really new here, but it is relaxing and familiar so I wouldn't protest to playing it.  People compare it to Ticket to Ride, but that is only because it also uses the Venture card drafting system.  This is all about hand management, there are many options available to you, but it is easy to get boned by bad card draws if you aren't careful.  Planners should like the game, but those that want to play something with any direct conflict, competition or even a way to effect other players should look elsewhere. 

If I were to say it was close to any other game I would put this more in the lines of St. Petersburg, all solitaire card drafting but without the money. Also both games use the I'll take the card you want "mechanic" to give at least some illusion of interactivity, although the game is so tactical (especially with the card sweep deal) that you can't rely on cards coming to you anyway.  I certainly like this game more, but it seems much less of a game.

For pure card drafting games like this, they will always inevitably be compared to Showmanager/Atlantic Star by me.  By that comparison, it just doesn't cut the mustard.

Totally inoffensive.  Somewhat compelling online, but best played as a diversion if at all.

This game is somewhat hard to rate - it's not as deep as some of the more strategic games (ie Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence), and it doesn't have the obvious interaction of some of the lighter games (ie Settlers of Catan).  However, once you delve into the game, it becomes readily apparent that there is a good level of strategic/tactical depth that easily overrides the luck of the draw factor this game has.  Also, while people claim you can play this game like solitaire, if you want to win against good players, you need to keep track of what they are doing, and sometimes more importantly, the pace they are employing.  As many have mentioned, there may seem to be a question mark over the replayability of the game, but I think the luck of the draw factor and multiple paths to victory makes this game viable over a long period of time.

Re-vamped commentary after quite a few on-line plays at BSW and a few face to face games. If BSW is your only experience with this game, you should sit down and play it face to face before passing judgment. Maybe it was just me, but seeing the real board and bonus tiles and how it all fit together made a major difference. Not only did I win my first face to face game, but while playing, was able to discern the whole array of options in a way that for whatever reason, had not been happening for me during the on-line experience. Still an '8' and were there an 'off-track betting' facility that handicapped choices for the Spiele de Jahre, I'd be laying money down on this one for 2006.

A nice and smooth game, with cute historical character to it (although far more appreciable by folks of German descent). It might be lacking action somewhat -- there is more action in Alhabmra, let alone TtR, but it still has a very clear idea of what's going on, what is your next aim, and what you need to do to succeed, although sometimes you need to plan and wait for another five turns before you close on the last of Baiern cities.

I got this thinking it would be a slightly heavier Ticket to Ride game because a lot of people compare it to that but I would have to say that really they are different enough that making a simple comparision between the two is selling this game short. There are a lot more interesting decisions to be made in this game. The design and artwork in the game is excellent too. There are so many different ways to score points on a turn that it gives you lots of tough decisions about what cards to toss and which ones to grab. I like the one 'cheat' per turn system too.

After initial play was thoroughly impressed. Simple rules to explain and understand, great gameplay with some difficult decisions, and most importantly, lots of fun. I like this one much better than Ticket to Ride because your gameplay changes from turn to turn. As a player you have to adapt to the changing situations around you. I can see why some people might not like the game because its really you against the game where as in TtR there is much more screwage and ways to cheat your fellow gamers out of some good plays. Chits and bits are just wonderfully produced and the map is nothing short of outstanding.

Cannot wait to play again.

RATING: 7
T&T works well enough as an entry-level German family game.  SdJ?  Whatever.  Every turn, you draw one or two city cards, then play one or two in front of you to make a route.  When you're satisfied with that route (usually after building on it for several successive turns) you evaluate (score and clear) the route for the opportunity to place markers on the board and score some points.  You're limited by 4 things: 1) you can only work on one route at a time; 2)you must place at least one card onto your route per turn; 3)hand size limit is 3; and 4)the available cards.  

Basically this game comes down to a race between you and whichever other player is employing the exact same strategy as you.  It's a game of objectives--to be first to place a marker into every country --to be first to place a marker in every city in a country--to be first to build a 5, 6, or 7 city route, etc.  Because there's no limit to the number of players' markers in a city, there is no blocking strategy.  So it's truly you against the card display.  There are decisions to be made, but to call it strategic or tactical is rather grandiose.  TtR-Europe and Marklin both offer much more tension and interaction than this title.

All that said, it comes with a beautifully illustrated board and quality components, and I would definitely play it again as a change of pace game.

Like Web of Power, in that you draw cards from a face-up display and play them to place houses. But you can't place the houses willy nilly - must add to either end of a chain you are building. You build chains (routes) of different lengths. Points come from finishing routes (longer = more), finishing routes sooner (more pts than later), and for having houses throughout each region or in all regions (again, more pts for those who accomplish these sooner). 

After initial plays: OK, but not terribly exciting. 6

After (Sep-2010) a few more plays on yucata, 2er: hmm, this may be better than I thought (at least 2er); you have more control, and the game should play fairly quickly (appropriate for its weight). 6.5?

To anyone who has played Ticket to Ride this game is going to look familiar.  This is a route building game where players draft cards into their hand from a display or face-down deck and play these cards to build routes from location to location.

The goals in this game are a little different though.  Instead of having specific routes to complete for points there are specific goal tokens that deal with getting pieces in all the locations in certain areas and length of route.  Players decide on their own when to complete a route and when a route is completed pieces are placed in either each location in that route in one area or one piece in each area that has a location as part of that route.

The thing that makes this game so variable is the use of the different officials.  During a turn a player can use only one but there are 4 different ones that have different benefits in different phases.

The game is incredibly accessible and looks nice with a nice insert which is also nice.  It does have a lot of similarities to Ticket to Ride but also has its own identity.  There are a good amount of decisions to make and I quite enjoyed playing it.

Enjoyable, quick and easy route planner. You build routes via stage coaches in Southern Germany. Since you cannot block each other paths (as many players as want to can use a route) it is all in the luck of the right cards to maximize your victory points. The scoring is actually done in a refreshing clever way. Speed is key as I realized, and that's what I like so much about "Thurn and Taxis", it is best played fast, and without any extra squiggles and therefor doesn't outlast its welcome. Have to see what I think of the expansions.

This was a game that I just blindly bought at my FLGS. I had heard it mentioned favorably, but besides the description on the back of the box and the awards listed on the front I knew very little about it.
I played a number of times with my wife and a couple times with some friends. We all enjoyed it just never made it to the table that often. We already owned Ticket to Ride which had a similar theme and mechanics but was slightly less complicated and that would often come to the table more often. I found it a bit difficult to teach for some reason so that made it hard to bring out with new players, especially when they were more casual gamers.
Overall a fun game, but for my current stage of life and playing style, I'd prefer something else.

MrsSorp did not like - said it was like "Solitaire" and I can't persuade her to try again. Now discovered i can play on BSW. I don't like it as much as TTR and the interaction is limited, however enjoyable for all of that. I count online plays. My knowledge of South German geography has improved.  Hm, why do i praise this 'solitaire' game and criticise others?  i Probably because i play this on-line whereas RFTG and San Juan have been face to face.

A more gamey version of Ticket to Ride, Thurn und Taxis is your typical SdJ-winner. I think it's pretty good. There are some interesting timing issues, and it's perfectly viable to follow different strategies. There are always some short-term goals to go for, which gives a sense of achievement, even when you don't win. Probably not too much replaye value in the long run, but I haven't reached that stage yet.

I played this only a few times.  It is basically a better more thought out Ticket To Ride although significantly more complex.  Quite good and I would never mind playing it, but it is also a game that I would never think of suggesting.

RATING: 7.25
This game is simple and beautiful enough to attract any crowd. It is perfect for those who want an introduction to modern board games, but will fall short for gamers looking for somthing meaty. Only good for one or two replays, after which the flow becomes obvious and the strategic element wears paper thin.

This is a decent game.  It didn't leave me with any strong impressions one way or another.  Even the beige-toned board looks rather nondescript.  But just because this game doesn't exactly Thurn my Taxis doesn't mean it's not a fun game that I wouldn't play again, because it is and I would.  So there.

RATING: 8
Quick and satisfying. We like the base game better than Power and Glory, which removes some of the tension surrounding being forced to play sub-optimal routes if your city card doesn't show.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A fine game of connections and racing to make bonuses for them.  From a display of six city cards (or the top of the deck) you draw one or two cards each turn, add one or two to your route, and score for it if you're ready to score.  The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.  P.S.  Raising this after 3 years of enjoyment from 8 to 9 because it is just so darned interestingly replayable for every number of players from 2 to 4.  This has been a games night staple since it came out and I am still jazzed about it every time I get the chance to play it.

Not much in the way of theme.  Easy to learn and play.  Game play is so-so, another set collection game.  Not a very deep game and very little (if any) interaction with other players.

[several plays] Even for me, who loves games people call dry, and who hates games with loads of player interaction this game does not have enough player intereaction.  I just can't bring myself to rate it as a great game. I totally feel like the other players are not even there.  Really I can not intentionally affect what they were going to do, nor them affect me.  I still will say the game is good.  It is enjoyable to play, it is fun to calculate the routes and try to make the best plays I can.  It plays with good pace and had some strategy to it.  It just is fair/good game not a great one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Rating based on 1 play (in which I lost horribly). I like it well enough, but it's not the second-coming as the hype would leave you to believe.

I'm not sure that the comparisons to Ticket to Ride are valid either. Yes, players are creating routes, but that's about all that's similar. To me, it feels more like a cross of China/Web of Power and St. Petersburg. Hand management is critical as one misstep could wipe out your plans for a turn or more. My only real complaint is the lack of player interaction.

Update: I'm growing to like this game more with each play.

RATING: 6.75
Played this a bit after a game of Ticket to Ride, and it's easy to see the comparisons between the two. There was some neat stuff going on in Thurn--the tension of deciding whether to continue your route another turn or cash it in right away, for example--but it just didn't click very well for me. The scoring and objectives just seemed a bit obscure and I just had a harder time being able to do the things I wanted to than I do in TtR. Again, hard to find things to say. It just didn't sit as well with me as TtR; the extra bookkeeping involved didn't seem worth the trade-off.

Fairly easy to learn and a bit more complex than say TransAmerica...though different strategic thinking.  Our third game finally seemed to lock in well.  Likely due to the cards being far better shuffled than in the first play!  Very intersting to think through whether one tries to finish first and ditribute the postal houses or shoot for regional dominance.

Very good middleweight game from the Seyfarths.  Card draw is reminiscent of Ticket to Ride.  Card play has a little bit of a push your luck element (although it's very easy to hold a card in reserve and be sure you can always continue).  Theme is very unique.  I like it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
You need to adapt to the cards you're offered: sometimes you can go for longer routes (but maybe not particularly valuable cities), sometimes you want to quickly grab shorter routes in good cities to claim regional bonuses.

RATING: 6
This game gets grief for the theme and admittedly building postal routes in 18th (19th?) century Germany might not be the most inspiring ever but the games the thing and the game is brilliant. it's often compared to ticket to ride but thurn has a lot more strategic depth. In fact, it would be a good next step when introducing new people to the hobby, giving people the familiar route building feel of TtR with another layer of strategy on top. I think it's great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty good game.  It feels a little like a cross between Ticket To Ride and Puerto Rico, more the former than the latter.  It's certainly not just a copy of either game though.  I might possibly rate this one higher after I become more familiar with it.  As it is, quite a good game and one I'd definitely play again and often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First play of the base game seemed a bit dry for me, and had too much multiplayer solitaire going on. The mechanics are well constructed and the components are beautifully designed, however the definite struggle between the players was not high enough to be exciting. So far a solid impression, and I'd like to try again. 

However, as this game reimplements Ticket to Ride, I'd rather play TtR.

RATING: 8
Played 10+ times. Very intriguing. It's pretty light, but I'm interested in exploring the mechanics.  My first impression is that it's a race game; for the bonuses, you always get 1 more point for doing something first and for the carriages, you end the game.  I don't know if the game will ever end by someone playing their 20 houses on the 22 spaces. Great for the work crowd at lunch. ***UPDATE** There's definitely more than one way to skin the cat.  It's definitely easier to finish the carriages than the houses but the houses are possible (I played 19 in one game).  At first glance the start player appears to have an advantage because he can get everything just before everyone else for one additional point.  But on the board play this is relegated because you definitely don't have to go for the same bonuses as everyone else.  If everything else is equal and everyone goes for the 3,4,5,6 and 7 carriages in order at the same speed the advantage will come from getting the 5, 6 and 7 length route bonuses first.  My suggestion don't just blindly follow the first player; Do a 7 instead of your 6 to pull that bonus first; pull the Cartwright to end the game earlier.  In reality all things are not equal and everyone is in control of the end game.  In the mechanics of the endgame the advantage is definitely for the last player.  Once he's done no one else gets an additional turn and every half finished route doesn't score anything.  The first player  has to be vary wary of other players finishing with 5 or 6 plus Cartwright and possibly jump ship in anticipation with a shorter route.  There's much risk involved in that because then the other player can wait an additional turn to get a longer route, while you can't do anything.  See also my discussion of the length of the game here. http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/117660 2006/08/06

There is a bit of everything in this simple game. You connect cities. Score points for long chains. You try to have one city in territory of each color or try to have your post offices in each city of the territory of same color. You collect cards and tokens. Everything sounds like a great game. But it lucks something. Game has no interaction at all. It plays more like a solitare then a addictive board game. I can easily see it played by 1 person only. It is not a much difference to play it with more players. But we love to play board games with friends and challenge them a bit. This game offers no chellenge at all. Board is very nice, machanics work well but game is boring and repetitive after few plays. I say no to solitare games! But i guess it might be fun for some also as a gateway game.

RATING: 6
This rating could climb higher. It's very good game for patient card players who like quiet and reflective types of games. Unlike other games based on drawing cards to make a connective path, such as ticket to ride and china, here you dont really block anyone. So it's sort of solitaire but do interact with others by how you manipulate the deck, what you draw. This takes a little more patience and memory than directly attacking people. On the downside there are probably lots of card games that play faster (we did four player in about an hour, but might be faster). Also the scoring system does not thrill me. It is not overwrought but still with about 5 separate ways to score, it's close. Such systems detract from a classic feel.

tl;dr: very good

This game has been around for over a decade now! I'm getting old!
Of course this is not my initial reaction, I did play this game a good amount when it came out. I owned a copy, but sold it after I felt I was done with it. But I hadn't played it quite a while, so this is my impression after playing it again recently.
This game has aged quite well. It falls into the family strategy category as the rules are pretty simple and accessible, but there certainly is a very solid amount of strategy there. There is some luck in what cards come out of course, but there's ways to deal with that and it usually evens out over the length of the game.
This is certainly a game like you would expect from Hans in Gl√ºck: it is very, very well developed. It is very clean without loosing depth.
All in all this is a very solid offering that doesn't feel dated at all yet. Certainly worth playing.

There are a few people in my game group that sometimes get a bit too competitive, even when playing things like Ticket to Ride - getting angry when a key route they need is claimed by another player.  I introduced Thurn and Taxis and described it as a "Less confrontational" variant on Ticket to Ride, and it took off.  I know there are some people that say that when playing with, for example, spouses, they try not to block in TtR.  Thurn and Taxis may scratch the same itch yet prevent the hard feelings, while not forcing players to play sub-optimally.

Not much interaction, and some choices are fairly obvious.  A good game where you can set short-sighted goals for yourself until the end of the game. I find it enjoyable on occasion.

I'm not quite sure how the heck this game won the Spiel. It isn't a terrible game, but the luck of the draw can take you out of contention pretty easily which lowers the rating a bit. This rating is for the base game alone.

For a rather light game without much player interaction at all, much less conflict, about creating postal routes in Germany, I've found Thurn und Taxis remarkably compelling.

Underrated by many who compare it unfairly to Ticket to Ride, Thurn and Taxis deserves more play. I need to get it to the table more often.

UPDATE: I've played this game quite a bit in the last month or two, and my opinion stands firm. This is a solid game. It's not particularly heavy, but with equally matched opponents, you really do have to pay attention and gather your routes in the correct order. As an advanced "casual" game, T&T is quite good.

RATING: 8
This is a nice, easy game to learn that has a feeling of depth.  There are several ways to score points, several ways to attack the system.  The color-coded cards are simple to wrap your mind around, the bonus point chits and role selection mechanisms add a lot of control.  Great game.

Sort of Ticket to Ride-ish, but a little shorter and more interesting. Your goals aren't secret for one thing, so it's easier to extrapolate your opponent's approach and then respond to it. I've mainly played with 2, and I like it that way quite a bit.

I really enjoy this game. Reminds me a little of a combination of Ticket to Ride and Elfenland, with a bit more complexity thrown in with the chit-collecting.

RATING: 9
Medium euro that rattles along very nicely. Probably got to be one of the dullest subject matter for a board game ever, but gameplay is magnificient. Always options to think of and plan ahead that hould eliminate AP in theory. Never quite sure who's going to win which is always good, but the most skilful players using the options available  to them should do so. Good time frame (90 mins tops), light thinky game, but with everyone involved from teh word go. I can't see me ever turning this game down, but it's early days, and as I come to it 5 years late, I have yet to see anyone else still playing it, so we shall see...

RATING: 6.5
I'm not sure what to think of this game. My initial impression was very good--it's an interesting take on the Ticket to Ride mechanics. But some aspects of the game prove more frustrating than fulfilling strategy-wise. Sometimes the moves you must make seem obvious, and it's more of a race to the finish rather than a strategic game, as some of the elements would have you think. But perhaps I have not given it enough of a chance (I certainly haven't won enough times to declare that I've figured this game out.) The components are beautiful and finding the right strategy could possibly prove to be a rewarding experience, so I'll play a few more times before making a firm decision about it.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More than solid ... this is probably one of the better games to emerge from the first half of 2006. Efficiency and planning are rewarded, but players also must adjust their play and strategies to what is available and what other players are doing. Theme is perhaps a bit dry, but that is more than made up for by a very streamlined design. Rating has been adjusted down slightly over time, though, as this game is very unforgiving. There is no catch-up mechanism and one mistake or a bit of bad luck early can leave a player just playing out the string with absolutely no chance of winning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
Thurn und Taxis resembles Ticket to Ride, but players don't have as much affect to each other. Post-offices can be planted anywhere as long as player hasn't already got one in that city. This makes T&T a bit too "Pay attention to your decisions and let others do what they want" -type of game - and I don't like that.

RATING: 6.5
Played 3- and 4-player so far. Initially engaging, this is not as exciting after a few games played. Decisions are not too difficult and the luck of the draw appears to be a significant factor. Fairly non-confrontational game, but I imagine it can be played nastily by scooping up a few key cities or flushing them from the board. Probably plays equally well with 2- through 4-players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Thurn and Taxis is easy to learn with nice components and nifty action choices.  Conflict is minimal (far less than the similar Ticket to Ride) which makes it a touch bland but also friendlier for newbies. It also bogs in downtime, but Thurn and Taxis is a good choice for recruiting friends to network-building.

China meets Ticket to ride. And again here's proof to the common rule that negative and negative is positive overall. 


Update: Downgraded this game from 6.5 to 5.5, because it doesn√Ñt have any tension. Apart from the 2-player-game all other 3- and 4-player-games ended up in one person doing one supermove midway through the game and had final scores of the winner finishing with  32 points and the others coming in at either around 17, 8 and 4 points (4-player-games) or both with 13 (3-player-game)The game still has some appeal, as it is a real light-weight.  

I come to play this more and more often. Why? Because rules are explained fast and so is the game itself. There's just something about it -> Upgrade

Very enjoyable, light game in a similar vein to Ticket to Ride (although with less aggression regarding blocking). In the five games played to date, the first player has won every time although I think this may be due to everyone following the same strategy rather than an inherent bias in the game. Initial rating of 8.

10 plays: The shine has worn off a little bit, but still a reasonably solid game. Rating decreased to 7.

German map and historical context - must be right up my alley, you're thinking.  Not so much.

Boy, there sure are a lot of ways to score. The building of routes reminds me a bit of building chains in Web of Power, but since anyone can go anywhere, player interaction is lacking.

One comment was made that it seemed easy to get the cards you wanted and while that's true I don't think that's where the game is made.  It's choosing which helper to take.  If you have to use administrator to get the card you wanted you might not get to play or take 2 cards which could prove to be important.  I liked it a lot.

RATING: 5
TRADED AWAY (2/2/08) --- I've only played the game on BSW, so this rating could definitely go up if I have chance to play it in person.  As usual, I wasn't completely enamored with the BSW interface, but the game seemed interesting enough, if not entirely original or fresh -- UPDATE: I finally had a chance to play the game in person, and as I expected the rating rose from a 6 to a 7 because I liked the components, and playing in person definitely added something.  The game still isn't particularly novel or interactive, but it's got enough going on to keep it interesting for the time it takes, which makes it a decent medium-weight eurogame -- UPDATE: Even playing in person there's almost no interaction whatsoever in this game.  It's far more multi-player solitaire than even Princes of Florence.  I've lowered my rating to a 5 because the game is feeling more repetitive and due to the lack of player interaction.  I hope not to play this again.

So quick to teach, lots of strategies, and controlable luck.  Okay so there is some luck, but a least it can be strategically managed.  I also like the fact the this game can really stress you out waiting for your next turn!  Some games have that, but at least you don't have to wait too long for your turn to come.  If you don't tell someone to hurry up at least once or twice during this game due to anxiety...  Well then you are not playing it right!  This game is well worth it, don't let the name, box cover, or theme scare you off, it is the #1 game in 2006 for a reason!

A clever route planning game with quite a bit of variability that requires some careful strategy. Limited interaction in looking at what other players are doing and taking cards that may be of advantage to them. The major thing I dislike about the game is the cart-maker mechanic that allows you to short-cut your way to the next rank of carriage. We always felt this made the game feel shorter and a little unsatisfying. The Power and Glory expansion is a must have in if you like this game.

Tries to scratch very much the same itch as Ticket To Ride, yet somehow far duller, both mechanically and thematically.  It's not *bad* as such, I just can't see any reason why I'd want to play it when I have TtR available (several versions, if I want variety).

A unique design by Seyfarth and Seyfarth. This quickly became one of my wife's favorites. The game has low confrontation, allowing you to essentially work on your own position while you race for the best VP tokens. Building of the continuous routes is a neat mechanic, as well as the two placement options when you complete a route.

I don't find this game to be like anything else I've played. I'm not sure why it gets compared to Ticket to Ride, other than the word "routes". For what it's worth, I prefer this game to TTR. I find the decisions to be more meaningful. While there is some randomness in the game, it is not present to the extreme seen in TTR.

This game scales very well. Any number of players is fun.

remains a fun game that most people can play and sit back and enjoy. light feeling yet plenty of tension, surprises, and moments of deviousness.

I wish it were a little more accessible...non-gamers have a hard time (in my experience) with the house placement rules and maybe the carriages. I feel like I am always repeating those rules.  So with nongamers there is that confusion, but then it doesn't feel like a game I want to play much with the gamers either.

I like this game, haven't tried expansions yet.  Opinions vary, but I think the game works great, the card driven mechanic and the piles of scoring tokens are unusual but well devised. I think this game needs to be played more often.

In Thurn & Taxis, players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways. The board shows a map of all the towns, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with one or two towns, and a large region with all the Bavarian towns in the center.
From a display of six city cards (or the top of the deck), you draw one or two cards each turn, add one or two to your route, and score for it if you're ready to score. The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.

Excellence in game design.  Graphics have such a compelling allure.  Everything fits together so well, even the lovely depictions of your carriage house developing.  Fun and deep within framework that's not too long or too short.  What you aim for, among the multiple objectives, evolves as the game progresses, depending on what other people are doing.

Very nice game.  Never felt much like placing post offices, which in my world is a pity.  But the artwork is excellent, and the gameplay nice and thinky.  Feels a lot like Through the Desert to me.

Won my first game by 4-5 points, only to discover after playing I'd (no, really) accidentally left a post office in my pocket.  It had no impact on the result, but it could have been closer if I hadn't been such a yutz.

This game has the potential to be an easy to learn, hard to master type game.  There's a lot of strategy involved, and in fact you *can* block other players if you're paying attention to what they are putting in their hand.  Great game thus far.

At first blush, after reading the rules, this game sounded simple, almost boring. The route connection mechanism and also the scoring methods were so, oh ho-hum.After designing Puerto Rico, you would think Seyfarth would top his previous game by designing an even more unique game. After two plays in a 2 player setting, I have to say that there is more to this game than meets the eye. It is most definitely not a hidden gem or a blow-me-over sort of game. However, it is a beautifully layered Euro, that even though is not overly complicated, gives you the usual gamut of head-aching decisions to make. The crux of the game lies in the several ways to end the game and how to maximize your scores. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. Ending the game with the 7-carriage is not as easy as it looks, even with the help of the cartwright. Finishing all the houses appear easier, but will yield you less points if you don't have the carriages to complement your scoring. A good but not great game. It is more complicated than TTR as a gateway game and certainly, I feel it deserves more credit than it has gotten from the standard BGG crowd.

101512: Feel exactly the same way as my previous review. Not the heavy weight as Goa, but clearly not terrible as the initial response. Would introduce this as a gateway game to folks on par with TTR. The balance between building shorter routes and competing for regional tiles to end the game vs. setting up longer routes and getting bonus tiles plus carriages is delicate and quite tight. A good two player experience. Bump to 7 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
For such a simple game there are a bunch of tough decisions.  Do I build a longer road or cash in as soon as I can?  Do I focus on one area?  You are never able to do everything you want to do.  The rule where you can claim all cities in one color, or one city in each color really makes this game.

I will definately need to re-rate this after additional plays.  I should probably wait until I play it again to rate it, but I felt like I was at the whim of fate for much of the game.  For now, I am blaming the game.  Still it could have been that I zagged when I should have zigged.  I still enjoyed the game, so it's not like I am giving the game a bad rating.

I played the game again, and I won, but I have reservations.  I went first.  At one point, if the player to my left had used the cartwright to take the 7 cairrage, it would have cost me 9 points.  Since that was slightly less than half my points, that seems like a mighty big swing.  Is it possible that going first is a disadvantage?  I have not played enough to be sure.

I friend of mine calls it "Euro-gamer Ticket to Ride". 
Postal service route building in Renaissance Germany, the theme and game play are pretty dry with none of the cutthroat route blocking in TTR. Dressed in its slightly dour colour palette, it seems to be pretending to be more serious and grown-up than its American cousin. The problem is, I don't think it is. 
My gaming group has decided to use our own theme for T&T: Renaissance breweries setting up brew houses across Germany! I'm even going to replace the carriage cards with versions showing larger and more complex breweries. Played with a few pilsners? Prost!

The mechanism in Thurn and Taxis is really great, but it's just that.

It also leaves no room for mistakes.

Went into this not expecting to like it, as I heard many comparisons to [gameid=9209], which I really don't care for.  This is better, but much like TtR, there's nothing to keep me here beyond a single game,  Strategy gets stale pretty quickly, as you realize that the large routes are the best way to score points.  Quick placement just doesn't have the payoff.  One of those eminently forgettable Spiel des Jahres winners, this one is already almost never played, and it's destined to be almost completely forgotten within another 5 years.

'Thurn und Taxis' was the final game, and again, one I had played before about the Bavarian postal system. Not a theme I would chose, but I know it is popular within the club, and whilst straightforward in many ways, I struggled with the setting of routes and whether these could be added to to acquire more? well and truly trounced on this one. I clearly have no aptitude for delivering post or making sure it runs on time. Perhaps I was having a bad day? The mechanisms are easy, accepting the previous comment, and there is a degree of frustration when the 'administrator' power is used as this allows all existing cards to be removed. I did use this myself. so it cuts both ways. I am not strong on 'pattern' styled games. I would play again to better my derisory performance and because this was the game that spawned a thousand songs.....

The comparisons to Ticket to Ride are obvious, but follow-up games are a bit disappointing to me because they seem derivative.  It does add some more interesting, strategic choices that TtR lacks, but the game takes a few turns to grasp.  The scoring mechanism isn't intuitive, which I think makes this a little less accessible to a general gamer.

Really enjoy that this is a 2 - 4 player game. It's nice to have a game that is a 2 player game but is not JUST a 2 player game like so many.

Was visibly disappointed with the lack of player interaction. 

There are a number of ways to score points in the game. If you like optimizing your moves given a number of choices but without affecting other players or getting affected by their moves too much then this game might be for you. Also, I just couldn't get into the theme much, so that affects my rating too.

So, if you are looking for a non-confrontational family game with more to it than say ticket to ride, this  will perfectly fit the bill. It is just not to my liking.

RATING: 8
A challenging game of maximizing each route built. Each route needs to accomplish multiple goals: earn the next carriage level, strategically locate post-offices to eventually claim position bonuses, and (at 5 or more cards) claim route length bonuses. Players may get away with an inefficient route or two, but probably not much more than that. Game ends when a player claims the level 7 (route length 7) carriage or places all post-offices. Sometimes it makes more sense to cash short routes to play your last post offices, than to try to build that Level 7 carriage.

Excellent game - incredibly simple (15 min) to set up and learn - DELICIOUS CHOICES!

In Thurn & Taxis, players build post office routes across Bavaria and the regions around, collecting bonus points in various ways. The board shows a map of all the towns, with roads leading from each one to some of its neighbors. There are various colored regions around the board, most with one or two towns, and a large region with all the Bavarian towns in the center.

From a display of six city cards (or the top of the deck), you draw one or two cards each turn, add one or two to your route, and score for it if you're ready to score. The fact that you *must* add at least one city to your route each turn or lose the whole route gives the game an enjoyable planning element.

RATING: 7
Thurn and Taxis feels a lot like Ticket to Ride, but with substantially deeper gameplay. You still collect routes and you still try to claim bonuses for linking different parts of the map. T&T just creates a lot more competition for those routes and the rules for laying down connections leave little room for error. If you start a route and can't add to it every turn until completion, you lose all of your progress and have to start again. It adds a lot of pressure and intensity to every decision, usually the hallmark of a great game.

This was one of the first games I bought, and I loved it at first. However, after about my 5th play, I developed a strategy that I'm pretty sure is optimal, and I played half a dozen more times and won handily each time but once (in which someone else did the same thing I was doing, but quicker). I read somewhere in the forums that many view this as sort of a race game; that may be so, but I don't enjoy that aspect of it. The inability to directly interact with other players also bothers me; after playing Ticket to Ride, I think that game is what I wanted this game to be.

In retrospect, this was the game that snapped me out of "collector" mode and slowed down my game acquisitions, so in that sense, I'm grateful.

Very enjoyable card collection and route optimization game. Players interact indirectly, stealing cards and bonus chits from one another, but the most important element of interaction is the timing of the endgame. You want to figure out when that might occur so you're not stuck with an unscored large route and a pile full of houses. Works well with two, three, or four players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Made more of an impression after the 2nd play.  I'm thinking it may be worth going for routes near the edges early on, making it easier to build long routes later - I'll have to try that next time.  Still not convinced about the Cartwright special ability, I think allowing a player to gain a carriage 2 cities shorter than required seems too much - perhaps changing it to '1 less' might feel better.

RATING: 6
The map and cards are mildly difficult to use initially; attractive, but not especially functional. Gameplay is interesting and only superficially similar to Ticket to Ride. I don't like that a 3-4-5-6-7 "rush" is a strong default strategy, which is another way of saying that I think the bonuses/penalties are slightly off. It should reward planning efficient routes more, and incidental opportunism less.  But still interesting and enjoyable, and a worthy "gamers" SdJ. 

Expansions all seemed weak, so I skipped them, but the base game was never truly a favorite anyway. Seyfarth still a one-hit wonder for me.

Cute game that evokes Ticket to Ride.  Scoring is completely different though - it's a low scoring game,  although I just realised that everyone actually starts at -20 points.  I think I've got a much better sense of what things are worth now - last game went for extreme carriage action and eked out a win by a single point.   Doesn't appear to have very much player interaction,  but it always seems that the cards you want are swiped by preceding players.  Cards are good quality, and the little houses are nice. I like the pictures on the board,  but the subtle shades of green and red aren't a distinct as I'd like.  I don't think anyone's ever made mistakes with the colours,  so maybe I'm just whining for the sake of it.  Or maybe it's because I've only seen it taught by Rick,  who is my game-teaching idol.

Driving our horse drawn carriages across Bavaria to be the first to set up postal routes.  Ticket to ride meets Puerto Rico is a casual comparison only in that we draw card routes from a face up central display to build routes, and we select roles from special postal workers. The strategy is to most efficiently match your cards to the highest value combinations for the reward objective tiles.

Thurn und Taxis is een spel dat vaak word vergeleken met Ticket to ride, maar dat is niet helemaal terecht.

Thurn und Taxis is veel taktischer dan Ticket to ride. Dit word ook geforceerd doordat je de hele tijd MOET bouwen aan je koetslijn. Meer keuzes maken dit spel voor mij toch echt leuker dan ticket to ride, al is die weer een stuk toegankelijker.

While this game does offer some interesting decisions the mechanics force very little long term planning onto you. I like the mechanics that prevent card hording but the downtime is bad with four as people have to look at all of their options on their turn since the cards turn over so often. When a game has mechanics that make it difficult to have any sort of long term planning and force downtime I won't be a fan.

I also dislike that I feel like there is very little player interaction. I think I would much rather play Transamerica. (Though I would play this over Ticket to Ride)

An unintuitive gameplay makes the game way harder to understand and play efficiently for non-gamers or beginners than its cousin Ticket to Ride. However, it's a great gateway+ game (mind you, don't play it as a next game after Ticket to Ride cause you might get disappointed after trying to compare these 2 totally different games based on the similar mechanic - connecting cities - which is yet so different at its core).
The board is absolutely gorgeous though it can be a little convoluted and hard to grasp once it gets covered with people's houses.
The theme and production values are strong in this one.
A very solid and light title. Highly, highly recommended.
Despite its age, and the trouble of finding a good company willing to play this title over the others, this is a keeper for me.

Sure, it's much better than Ticket to Ride, but it still left me empty. Using Germany as the map kept spatial relations difficult to determine, especially once the board started filling up with houses. Luck still plays a large part -- perhaps determining the outcome. If I need to purge the draw cards to get 1 card I need while the player to my left happens to get 2 cards he needs at a time, until he can play 2 cards at a time, I'm going to suffer. Especially since there is no way to "catch up" in the game. The game discourages falling behind by having everyone coming in late to a region scoring progressively fewer points. One small spell of bad luck early in the game feels like it would result in an unrecoverable position.

I've only played this on BSW, which has a really nice interface.  Honestly when I read the rules I wasn't very impressed by Thurn and Taxis, it felt very simplistic and it totally dropped off my radar after I had contemplated on purchasing it.  Anyway, on a whim I decided to give this a shot and was genuinely surprised at how much fun I had with it.  True, the game was no more than collecting the right city cards to build your route, and there is very little strategy involved, it is mostly dependent on whether your opponent is trying to end the game as quickly as possible or prolonging it, so you will need to adjust your style accordingly.  Even so, I've came to appreciate the simpicity rather than my initial disdain of it.

Update: T&T seem to require some defensive plays in drawing cards your opponents need (mostly the leader), this is especially relevant with 3-4 players, and it suffers if people don't realize this.

J√≥l, tetszik. A pontsz√°m egy j√°t√©k ut√°n nem m√©rvad√≥, de a TuT-nek a  a polcon a helye egyel≈ëre, azt√°n majd megl√°tjuk.

After 1 Play: Not a bad game, but nothing that makes me itching to try it again.

After 5+ Plays: After a few more plays I'm lowering this from a 7 to a six.  A bit of common sense is required but no interesting strategic choices

very simliar to Ticket To Ride, maybe even slightly more deep - but feels and looks more boring

I own this but haven't played it yet. Rules are a bit much, and I haven't been able to convince anyone to test it with me yet. Mostly bought this because of The Crying of Lot 49.

It's one of those games that you can explain the rules in five minutes and people will want to play again right after their first game...might be a bit short in the ultra depth department and the theme is a bit weak but there are a few games that you can get both your mom and your nerd buddies to play and have it be a fun time...  It's a good value too

Yup, deserved the SdJ-price. Played it several times now not expecting much but I really like it. Not complex or deep but a fun and easy family game.
Gets a lot of play by the kids.
Updated and raised to a 7 (maybe even an 8)

Very good network building game with subtlety different card draw actions on your turn

Feels a lot like Web of Power and thus I do not like this so much. The game is nice and all, but there is simply something that does not work for me.

Short turns and multiple ways to go about gathering up points. I like both of those things very much in games.

A fun game, somewhat similar to Ticket to Ride. It's light, quick and there's a number of decisions to make.

It's not a favorite of mine, but it's a fun game that doesn't tax the brain too much.

At last board game with difference! Playing it feels more like jigsaw puzzle solving then usual strategy/tactics play. And it's real refreshing.

Construir rutas de correo con al menos 3 cartas. Decide si poner las casas en CADA pueblo de la ruta en 1 regi√≥n, o en UN pueblo de cada regi√≥n. Gana PV x regiones, largo de rutas, presencia, etc

Although it is similar to the Ticket to Ride series of games, I felt it had more decision-making and more strategic depth.

The fact that you can see what other players are planning (due to the region bonuses) is a lot more interesting than the hidden agendas of the destination tickets in TtR.

It was about as easy to teach to my family, too, and cheaper to buy!

Would definitely recommend as a family game.

Low interaction between players, ie. no direct confrontation.

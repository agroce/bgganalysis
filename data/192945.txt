Initial rating. 

Introduces a nice take on worker placement games. Every component (except round markers) are cards, including workers. To go to a spot a player must climb the existing amount of workers by exactly 1 using their hand of cards.

After only a three player game I can only say I love it as much as it's big brother. Love the worker/card mechanism that you have to play exactly one more. 

The 2 player game plays really fast love it.

Coal Baron in name and theme only, compared to its namesake. Gameplay is quite different.
It's a card name that is largely luck dependent in terms of what is available. You just try to do your best to pull the best card with what is left in your hand.

Different enough from Coal Baron to make it a good game on its own. I'm not a big fan of card-only games because the card design needs to be spot on to very easily differentiate between the different types of cards, and this is not the case here.

RATING: 8
A very nice little "worker placement" card game, though I find it very different from its big brother. Coal Baron was principally a board game about action efficiency, whereas CB:TCG is as much about risk and tactical flexibility. 

Each placement spot is its own separate deck, and as such, may not give you a card you want for a long time (if at all), so you have to be quick to adapt to changing circumstances. This can be frustrating if you're thinking of this as a typical Euro-style board game, but it works great as a card game. It's still deeper and more interesting than most card games, and this would be the perfect travel game if the box weren't so stupidly and unnecessarily big.

Did like the mechanism a lot but I am not a fan of games in which 'scoring cards' decide who wins the game. I like building trains, filling them with coal and letting them leave, and that is what this game should be about. Scoring cards just add luck and offer a non-enjoyable strategie (that is in my opinion offcourse).

The Coal Baron card game offers a big game in a small box. Instead of working with cards only this could easily have been a "full" board game, and it plays like one. Clean, efficient, or in short a typical Kramer/Kiesling design.

Has a very familiar feeling to it, similar to First Class, but I think this game might have more interesting things going on than FC. I really enjoy the worker placement mechanic here and the variability in how you can use your cards. At it's heart, this is a pickup and deliver game with a unique twist. I need to play it more to see if this solidifies as a top 25 game for me or if the luck factor will keep this from being a special game in my mind.

Pretty good and thematic card game, that plays like a worker placement board game.

There is some luck involved, as you can only take the topmost cards, but there is an option to search through the top 4 cards of any stack and there is more than enough room to plan ahead, which is a great thing.

This feels like the tactical version of the boardgame. Both are nice and differ enough from each other, hence I rate them the same.

Compared to the board game, this game is actually way more complex, but at the same time more luck dependant. 
That is usually, atleast in my book, not for the better. 
However, the game is actually quite charming, but the board game is in my opinion the better game. 

As for similarities, there is not many, expect for the idea that you have to play +1 worker to do an action, and the theme obviously. This game is more of a "many steps to VPs"-game than the board game, and the feel of the game is very different.

You can get lucky, or unlucky, with what cards are available when it's your turn, and that can mean some really big swings in VPs. 

The game is in my opinion fun, and should be played fairly lightheartedly. if players try to overthink it, the game can really bog down... for really no reason...

I shouldn't like this game, but I do!

Calling it "The Great Card Game" is a bit much, eh heh.

Has similar mechanics from original game: being able to place anywhere but needing exactly 1 additional worker than previous player; having point/efficiency incentives to try to use/collect similar modes of transport, etc. That being said, the game feels very different from original game and takes the same amount of time (if not longer??).

I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  The worker placement mechanic of using cards is fantastic and makes you pay careful attention to the game state as it evolves each turn.  There are ample opportunities to pursue different paths to score points.  Plays fast and turns flow quickly.

The first time I played this, I really liked it and felt its a better version compared to the original Coal Baron. But the more I played it, I realize in the many rounds, you only really do 2-3 deliveries. It's just a lot of fiddly actions without actually doing anything worthwhile save for the few point of delivery. The luck element is also very prevalent in this game. You could get really screwed if the "sets" you're looking for didn't appear during your turn. Sold it.

The innovative element is the way cards are played. Each player has the same number of cards representing workers with values between 1-5. The twist is that a card might only be played to a stack if it is exactly one higher in value than the previously played card. Thus, higher cards are not automatically more valuable than a lower value number which might be the required card to get access to the desired stack of cards. The resulting hand management is the most interesting part of this card game.

Compared to the decent boardgame, Coal Baron - the Great Card Game is longer, more random, less thematic and less accessible while not being deeper. The battle for majorities is replaced with a less interesting synergistic engine building. The bad part about the engine building is that the engines are only distinguished by name, not strategy. Everybody is building the same engine, just for another mechanically identical industry and another color of locomotive.

I get the rationale behind publishing a card game accompanying a successful boardgame. While there are enough thematic similarities to recognizably be a variation of the boardgame, Kramer and Kiesling took a jump into the wrong direction by making it longer and more random with a pseudo differentiating engine that simulates depth while the deepest thing in this game is the excavated coal. Another superfluous card game implementation of a better boardgame with a clever hand management mechanism which would be worthy of being reimplemented in a better game.

A good game and can move quite quickly even with 4 players. You can't really plan any strategies, more react to whatever cards are available on your turn which is why it doesn't score higher.

Fun game, but feels totally different game than the boardgame version is. And this one is more complex than Coal Baron and that's why it takes even more time to play. The game is good - my rating might go even higher - although I think the board would bring some clarity to different kind of actions. And again, the card game takes even more space than the boardgame needs - this seems to be more the rule than the exception. Coal Baron (the boardgame) gets 10 from me, because it's such a smooth and fast to play - this card game won't ever get the same rating, but still... this is a good game too.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

I might just prefer the card game to the boardgame! The boardgame is likely more simple and straightforward to play. This is also about fulfilling contracts and there is a lot of similarities/ties to the board game while still being its own game. There is cleverness in the card play as you may have to pass before using all your cards due to always having to play exactly one more worker value than the previous high bid. I think there are multiple paths to victory/points. I think people passed on acquiring end game cards a few too many times in my first play. There are five rounds of play, so I'd be looking to set up myself stretching out my work force as much as possible early and perhaps seeking to focus more late.  Ultimately, I'm uncertain its one I will pick up, but it is one I'm happy to play. Play time for card game and board game are about the same.

This is a well-designed card game. Sure it sprawls big on the table and some times you have to be lucky to get the right draw.

Hoping to play its big brother Coal Baron.

Enjoyable, and I did not find the occasional topdecking to be an issue at all.

[b]Coal Baron: The Great Card Game[/b] was sold via auction 11/18/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I was cautiously optimistic when I found out Kramer and Keisling where producing a card game version of Coal Baron. I had played Coal Baron and really enjoyed it, but the production issues combined with the fact that it was not at it's best with two lead me to pass on it.

Similar to the board game you have to plan your actions ahead of time, especially getting coal and making sure you have the wagon cars to hold the coal and engines to ship it and fulfill your contracts. I like the addition of stocks in the game, they give you points for shipping to certain factory types. However; the biggest improvement for me is having numbered worker cards to manage versus a pool of worker meeples. You still have to pay one more worker than the person before you in order to take an action. In Coal Baron: TCG you have worker cards numbered 1 - 5 to spend in order to take an action, so managing which numbers you keep in your hand becomes extremely important. You do not want to be left with workers in your hand that you can't play or having to take an action that you really don't need; efficiency is key to success in Coal Baron: TCG. 

My one concern are the end game bonus cards you can get; in my plays there was a point in the game where everyone would go to that space repeatedly trying to get cards that complimented their strategy. There are a lot of points to be had with those cards and I've yet to see someone win who didn't have quite a few of those cards. It is not necessarily a problem, but it doesn't seem possible to win just sticking with shipping coal for points. I've only played a handful of times so I may be completely wrong, time will tell. 

Overall I'd still recommend Coal Baron: TCG over the board game because it offers a more streamlined experience, which includes the components; I also really like the having to manage your worker cards and the game plays great with two. Just be aware that Coal Baron: TCG is a table hog, but everything is is well laid out so the game flows smoothly.[/i]

I find that they did an excellent job with La Ganja: The Dice Game - No Siesta, that still has the La Granja - feeling, but feels different enough from the original and so has his right to exist on it's own and to own this version also. 
I had the exact same feeling about this cardgame version of Glück Auf. You recognize Glück Auf in it, but it's more then different enough and it's a full game, not a simple filler. For components reason and the movement of the mining shaft, I think I would prefer the boardgame over this cardgame, but this cardgame clearly proves you can make a full, excellent game with 'only some cards'.

If you like Coal Baron you will most likely enjoy this card version of it. They did a great job with implementing the board game. They didn't cut down on the time which is one thing that makes Coal Baron great, is that it is so short with lots of punch. The card game has potential to be the same length and perhaps not as good but still solid. I will be looking to pick this up when it is available. I really liked this one a lot.

RATING: 7
I was originally attracted to this game by the idea that I might get a similar experience to Coal Baron proper, but without the tile warping component issues, in hopefully a faster play time. Really though, this game is it's own creature. The general idea here is players get cards that have a certain number of printed workers. A card display is laid out by type, and players take turns assigning their worker cards to the various spots, to claim cards. This gets tricky quickly as to take an action, you must lay down 1 or more cards where the sum of workers is exactly 1 greater than the cards used to take the previous action in that spot.

What you are doing with most of these actions is taking and then trying to complete recipe cards in the most efficient way possible. The game gives you a few hurdles in this, for example you have to take actions to get carts, then get the coal into the carts, then you need a train at the front of your lines of carts, all the while doing color matching between the carts and the train docks. While you are doing your best to manage this, you are also collecting bonus cards that customize your scoring criteria for the end of the game. This is certainly a mechanism that excites me, but drawing the right cards can be crucial and adds just barely a little more luck than I'd like.

I like this game a lot. I don't think it needed a coal theme, and honestly, if it had another theme I'd have better luck getting it played, as I've sort of worn my group out on Coal themed games.

This game feels like a slightly lighter and faster viticulture. They both kind of scratch the same itch, where you are fulfilling orders. At first I didn't think I was going to like this game, but it is really good. The theme meshes well with the mechanics. You ship the coal and are off to working your next order. This is basically a worker placement game with cards. It also has that similar mechanic to Manhattan Project: Energy Empire, where you can still go to a place as long as you pay more than the last person there. The twist to this one is that you have to place exactly one point higher than the last to go there. This could cause you to be unable to get some of your worker cards out in a round if you do not manage your numbers right. When I first got a demo of it I was like, "Meh". I actually won it at a convention after that. When I read the rule book things made more since, and after this play I really like it. Very happy with this game. Recommend as a complementary light-medium card game to pull out when you want to scratch the viticulture itch, but want to do it in no more than an hour. **Wife:8

2-4 players, best-none; Box says 50-80 min. In reality, I think it is more like 40-45 min per player. (So a minimum of 80-90 min).  But the time passes quickly because the turns go quickly and there isn't a lot of down time.  Depth 2.67.

Although I wouldn't consider this a 'heavy' game, it does take some time to learn all the rules. The rule book fairly good, but seems a little confusing in spots.  So I would recommend viewing Rahdo's run-thru before playing-- it is very helpful. 
Although it might take some time to fully understand how the game works, once you get through the 1st game, you'll find that it is quite fun.  
I have just a couple of minor complaints.
- The 'order' cards and 'objective' cards look kind of similar and you can get confused as to which is which-- it would be nice if they could have been a different color shading. 
- The game takes up a lot of table space (not really a complaint, but just an observation).   

All in all, this is a really great resource management game.  If you can endure thru the learning process on the 1st game, it really is a lot of fun.  Works well with 2 and with 3 players.  I haven't played with 4, but I'm thinking with 4 it would be more tense since there would be more competing for the right cards.

Excellent innovative use of cards. I have a deep love of the card as a component and this game is an ode to the adaptability of a card.

The game play is a fun competitive worker placement game with more weight than you might expect. A new favorite in my collection.

Good and enjoyable game of task prioritisation, different from, and in some ways better than, the board game. In any case, sufficiently different from the board game to be intriguing in its own way. I'm more than happy to own both.

A slightly simplified version of Coal Baron the board game, that removes the cubes, meeples, big board and pit lifts. There's absolutely no reason to own both games and this will be the one that I'll be keeping. I'll be keeping this one because I can leave the big box behind and take it to gaming nights in a snack sized zip lock bag.

Pleasingly the game is quick to learn, teach and plays at a very decent clip. 45 minutes should be enough, even with the maximum player count. Place your worker cards down and pick up the component required to fulfil your contract. Coal lorries, wagons, engine, contract. Move the coal on board and then send the train off. Six steps, but there are ways to pace yourself efficiently, ship efficiently, match your contracts with bonuses and shares. There's enough to keep me occupied, but not so much that I'm straining my brain at any point. It's all very civil and gentle. I find that because it's such a short and quick paced game that I'm rather enjoying it. Nothing ground shaking, but a thoroughly decent game to fit in the jacket pocket and take with me as a longer filler. Stupid box.

Unfortunately the box size is a missed opportunity. Three cards could have replaced the individual player boards. (For portability I've copied the player boards on paper and folded them over in three sections.) The game could have easily been sold in a Port Royal sized Pegasus Spiele box. Instead we get a card game in an oversized box filled with air. So then why not provide a board? The bean counters obviously made a decision, but I think it was the wrong one. This would have made an excellent small box card game.

Coal Baron: The Great Card Game is a fun set collection card game, but it doesn't really offer anything that pulls me in enough to seek it out over more interesting and variable games.

I haven't played the original Coal Baron before, but I am surprised at how much table space can be consumed by a card game in a small box. This plays very much like a conventional worker placement and contract fulfillment Euro, with the slight [thing=122515][/thing]-esque twist of playing down workers in ascending value to obtain cards. 

In part because this is a card game, there is a strong element of luck of the draw. Getting same-coloured engines and endgame objectives which sync with your existing cards can definitely create VP swings in your favour. I like the hand management aspect of handling workers, but otherwise the rest of the decisions don't feel engaging enough for a game of this length.

I like the boardgame Coal Baron. But for me the card game is even better. Lot's of decisions to make and enought interaction with your opponent. I think it is at its best with two players

tl;dr: similar but different

I quite liked the board game this is based on, and this didn't seem like a watered down version. It's not. I think it's probably about the same weight and complexity as the board game. There are clear similarities (the worked placement part most of all) but it's also suitably different.
The board game was just a very good rendition of elements we had seen before many times, and this game does the same. It doesn't bring anything new, but it works as it should. It's not just an OK game that reuses known elements it reuses them not in a way where you get the feeling 'oh, this mechanism again', but it all feels very natural and the game play almost comes naturally by just looking at the components.
A very solid game again, but don't expect anything earth shattering.

Initial rating: 7.2/10

RATING: 6.9
It certainly lives up to its name as the 'Big Card Game', since it took up more space than the original game. It also felt a little bloated, and perhaps over polished. Everything was a bit too smooth and inoffensive and on a first play (with some experienced gamers) we cleared out most of the cards and almost all of the scoring cards. there didn't seem to be much if anything still to explore in the game after one play.

I'm also of the opinion that this would be better (and clearer and easier to follow) with a board...

A worthy effort, but not one I'll be rushing back to.

Meh. Maybe I wanted it to be too much like the board game. Still, it's pretty chaotic, at least 4p. It doesn't have CB's redundant selection spots, so coal and cars get crowded. Seems, 4p, like it's channeling too many actions down too FEW slots. Scoring is a lot simpler, and I don't miss the elevator much.

I have not played the non-card game version, but this felt ok. Nothing specially good or bad, and we had some issues with the rules (all newbies), but nothing major. Lots of stuff on the table at first, lots to do, which meant quite a slow play. Probably gets faster in the future with more plays, but we will see - no special need to play more.

I can see why some people like this, but it doesn't offer anything new or truly exciting. I think that First Class -- a game that explores a similar design space -- does a much better job of it.

Set collection card game using worker placement to mine coal, load coal into railcars, send trains to deliver contracts, buy stock in processor and shipping companies, and hopefully score bonus objectives.  The distinctive game play comes from the action selection using groups of valued worker cards from identical player decks.  The other fun and unique elements come from drawing multiple cards to hopefully get what you need spurred by the benefit from leveraging combinations--good stuff.  Simple and tight rules allow players to focus on maximizing payoffs between set collection, tech upgrades, stock investments, and objectives.  Deeper optimization puzzle than I was expecting.

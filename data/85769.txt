The rating is based on the playing of scenario 1 with most of the applicable Advanced Rules. Easier to pick up than a straight reading of the rules would suggest. The scenario did seem well balanced (despite a fair we;lement of luck). Having the initiative appears to be a significant benefit - it would be nice to be able to trade off some other advantage (commands) to enhance chance of winning initiative (this may even be in the unexplored Optional Rules). Spotting also seems too easy - to the point where we thought we may be misinterpreting the rules or, if not, some house rules might be desirable (or, again, this could already be covered by an Optional Rule).

Very much looking forward to the chance to play again.

  Played the 1st scenario basic game tonight.  Really reminds me of Panzerblitz in a good way.  Being first to fire is important, hopefully you've got him moving while you're shooting.  I'm used to a larger variety of tanks in battles.  Because the details of each tank are so different, there's an emphasis on having just a few different tanks types in each battle rather than one of each of everything under the sun.  For me, starting with the basic game is important to figure out all the charts before moving on to the advanced game.

The designer includes a lot of background info to help make DIY scenarios easy to generate.  Living rulebook is out.  Relatively minor changes with some clarifying text.

Rating will probably go up with more play.

RATING: 8
It's a great game But for one flaw as the other people have pointed out. The initiative system causes problems. If you get the initiative, at the right time you can devastate you opponent as you Fire FIRST before the other side can return fire. Only other minor quibble is that the infantry counters are very generic and bland.

Other that that it's an excellent game. The combat system works well and once you get down how it works is actually fairly quick.

After further plays upped the rating one. I'm just having a blast playing diffferent types of scenarios.

RATING: 10
Panzer is a very exciting and tactical game that simulates armor combat during WWII. The modular setup allows you to learn as you play with good progression, this is quite useful for players that are not familiar with wargames. The complex mechanics for combat is very well designed and realistic, this forces the player to consider numerous factor (environment, distance and facing of the tank) before making a final decision. Overall, panzer is an amazing game esp. for people that are interested in tanks. However, the base game only comes with very limited amount of units so the first expansion is definitely recommended to be purchased at the same time.

I was a big MBT/IDF fan back in the day, so it's not a huge surprise I like Panzer a lot. It's still got some 80s quirks - roll low for HE, high for AP, so on other charts, take a guess. And the rulebook is way too wordy for a not-very-complicated game. But, it plays quickly, action is pretty sharp and fast, and it gives an authentic feel for mobile conflict. It fills a nice niche above (A)SL(SK) in scale, and is good at gaming scenarios that game can't handle. The command & control rules aren't quite as clever as the MBT ones were, but still pretty good. As with MBT, the basic game is extremely playable, the advanced rules add a modest but sensible level of complexity once you're familiar with the basics, and then the optionals are all good for the hard-core I'm sure but most people will be quite happy to leave them out.

My only real substantive complaint about the package is the rules, which for a game of this complexity are not great. Admittedly, by GMT's standards they're still pretty good. But, a lot of copy-and-paste, and a number of areas that while you can get by really aren't clear enough (direct fire smoke and hand-to-hand combat with multiple units on both sides being two cases that come immediately to mind).

Anyway, still a very good game, and one that can only get better with time as more scenarios, units, and maps are added and rules get clarified.

Good news and bad news. The good news is that the components are nice, the plotted movement has been replaced with a simpler chit command system, and the rulebook is in color with some nice illustrations. The player aids are nice and some of the advanced and optional rules are deep.

The bad news is that the initiative system, as written, is garbage. Currently the side that wins the initiative fires first, meaning ALL his units fire first BEFORE the other side's units get to fire. This can, and probably will, determine the outcome of the battle more than your tactics will.

Outside of the initiative system, I think they went overboard with the rules a bit. The rulebook is huge, with a large section dedicated to indirect fire, something that most people probably won't use in practice. I would have cut that. I'm also disappointed at the lack of modular and modifiable maps. That was something that Yacquinto did right. GMT just gives you a single sided paper map with no way to modify it. And they give you fewer tanks than the Yaquinto version. Lame.

As far as the initiative system goes, the good news is that it's easy enough to adapt your own initiative system. Anything from a simple alternating initiative system to the one posted in the files section would be better than what the current rules have.

Not unsalvageable, but if you already have the Yaquinto version, hold onto it.

Still need to try adding in more of the advanced chrome, like arty, planes, etc..

This is a marvelous update of the old Yaquinto PANZER game.  That said, it is still very much a 1970s design--the map is one piece and not double-sided.  While the expansions provide geomorphic boards, you don't get the moveable terrain and geomorphic boards of the original game.  Instead you get something very reminiscent of old SPI-era tactical game maps--very generic.  The data cards are not cards--they are cardboard and gorgeous.  Plenty of charts for both players and the game is quite well produced.  Nearly all the ideas in this game have been covered in other tactical treatments, but this system is easy to learn and very intuitive.  I resisted getting the game since I have so many others but I'm glad I relented.  I think Jim Day's armor system will pick up a new generation of fans with this title.  Hard to imagine playing this without the expansions, however.

Excellent armor tactical game. Don't be intimidated by the charts and detailed unit info as the game is really quite easy to learn.

weak sauce.

I own all the Yaquinto 88/Armor/Panzer games and I would always play them over this new edition.  

Turning the game into a IGO/UGO scheme with an all-important single initiative roll completely sucks versus the original simultaneous fire and plotted move system.  Is plotting perfect?  No.  But I could think of several better ways this 2nd edition could have gone to be more modern without making the game a dice-off (alternating movement, chit pull, etc.).

I would also defend the plotted move system as a good FoW and command-control element.  IGO/UGO gives you a eagle-eye perfect viewpoint because you know precisely where your opponent moved.

My rating is also based on the rules-as-published, not house rules.  I understand house rules to fix the fundamental problems with this edition would not be too difficult.

Each Yaquinto game also covers more territory due to more vehicles in each game and modular construct-your-own maps.

Essentially, this game does less, in a less satisfying way, for way more money.

I have played the game extensively for 3 weeks.  After several plays including the advanced and optional rules, the game plays seamlessly.  There is a sufficient Fog of War, and Command and Control is basic, but effective.  The system has legs too.  With 2 expansions at release, and 1 additional on p500, there are plenty of actions to be had. For vassal players the module is very well done, and reminds you of a miniatures game.  Or if you choose you can use the standard counters for the classic board game feel.  The system also fits well with vassal PBEM with very few file swaps.  Yes this game has echoes of yesteryear wargames.  To me that is a good thing!

A very solid game system. Hardware oriented, it also does a good job with infantry fighting.

Cons: thin paper sheet rules, improvable map, hex scale.

RATING: 7
Good: WWII - Tactical - Medium

Plus:
-Playable system which reflects the tactical warfare pretty well
-A great alternative to complex tactical games like ASL
-Very cool innovations; order chits, ammo, armor values that makes sense, comprehensive infantry rules
-Accessible

Minus:
-Very steep price
-Cartoonish maps (yes they are functional, but plain ugly compared to MBT)
-Overall disappointing looks (could have been printed in the eighties / nineties)
-Turrets rules are well done but the turret chits are a bit clunky (I couldn't do it better but it is just an observation)

Bought it as companion for MBT (rules redone, MBT has a bad set of rules).
Compared to MBT this is disappointing as far as looks are concerned. Rules are definately more streamlined but the poor graphics and ugly maps(compared to MBT) prevent this from giving the love I gave MBT. I wish I could use the MBT maps but they enlarged the counters. Well, I play MBT instead.
Nice game but misses something that I find in MBT.
I am really annoyed about the steep price, components are nothing special.

Overall a good game but not nearly as good as MBT.
Please Jim, can you make MBT II or IDF II?!

Haven't had the desire to play this.

Never visit a Game Store if you feel blue. To buy a Game will give you just a short Change of Mood. Nevertheless I am happy to own this Game. Just bad that I prefer the early (1941/1942) and late (1944/1945) Battles on the Eastern Front. So I will have to buy Expansions 1 and 2.

Played a selfmade Scenario, which pitted two Tiger II's against four T34/85. After two Rounds were two T34 burning and the lead Tiger II had two minor Dents in its frontal Armour. I ended the Play there because the Soviets had no Chance against the Tiger II's. Next Time will the Soviet need much more and/or heavier Armour.

RATING: 10
Tiger tanks, T-34's, 88mm flak guns, they’re all here; a game about tanks with rules for infantry. Panzer is a highly enjoyable tactical World War II game focusing on individual tank on tank combat without neglecting the role of infantry squads, artillery, and air power. The scale is one vehicle per counter. Infantry units consist of one squad, half squad, or section per counter. A typical scenario involves one to three companies per side. The rules are modular, allowing players to adjust the level of detail and complexity. Adding the advanced and optional rules results in a fairly crunchy system that still feels streamlined. Commands are issued to each unit or group of units using counters that are revealed when the command is executed. There are five commands: Fire, Move, Overwatch, Short Halt, and No Command. The Overwatch command is essentially an opportunity fire command executed as a reaction to fire or movement. Short halt allows a unit to fire and move. No Command improves the chances of recovery from suppression or morale broken. Corresponding to each unit is a thick, sturdy, data card that displays offensive, defensive and movement information. This speeds game play eliminating the need to clutter the counters with stats. Each counter, measuring a generous 7/8 inches on a side for vehicles, and 5/8 inch for infantry, displays the data card ID corresponding to it and movement stats, leaving more room for a gorgeous, full color illustration of the tank, truck, gun, APC, aircraft, or infantry squad represented by the counter. The map is nothing special, and pales in comparison to the counters and data cards, but is still very functional, and for purposes of establishing line of sight, is probably preferable to a prettier but more cluttered map design. 


Overall, Panzer is highly enjoyable. The combat system is awesome! I like the command mechanics. I do, however, have a couple of issues with the system: initiative and sighting across obstacles.  

Basic initiative is the least satisfying aspect of this game, and has also been a big source of debate on BGG. A single initiative roll determines which side gets to execute all of their fire commands first. It seems unlikely that all 15 or more tanks and/or other units of a company would get the jump on all units of the opposing company. An optional rule, called Staggered Initiative, addresses this issue. Under this optional rule, initiative can be rolled for each platoon, or any grouping the players desire. This resolves most of my issues with the initiative mechanics. Admittedly, though, Staggered Initiative involves more die rolls and influences how formations are chosen to execute the next Fire command. Why roll initiative to fire on a platoon that has already fired? Makes more sense to roll for fire against units that are still a threat. 

I have experimented with resolving initiative on a per command basis. In general, roll initiative anytime both players want to execute the next command or compel the other player to execute the next command. During the Direct Fire phase, this way of playing is similar to the official Staggered Initiative rules. The formation grouping in this case consists of all units sharing the same command. I use the optional platoon command control rules. So only units from the same platoon can share commands. The main difference is that under my rules, initiative rolls might also be made during the Movement phase. While typically players always want to execute the next Fire command, they might not want to execute the next Move command. So the winner of an initiative roll might compel the other player to move next. While this way of playing involves more dice rolling, in practice, movement is often conducted without the need to roll initiative. 
 
My other issue with this game concerns sighting. The sighting rules for the case when line of sight between opposing units at different elevations is partially blocked by an intervening obstacle are inaccurate. I picture a line of sight from the higher unit across the lower obstacle forming two nested similar right triangles (for more detail, please see my gallery). Based on this picture, I determine the length (in hexes) of the Blind Zone, B, by multiplying the Height Level of the obstacle, H, with the distance, X, (in hexes) between the obstacle and the higher vehicle and dividing this product by the difference, D, between the height of the higher vehicle and the height of the obstacle. So, B = HX/D. 

As written my initial rating is a 9, but my main issues with the game, sighting and initiative, are easily changed. The rest of the game is awesome. So my final rating is a 10. The combat mechanics hit the sweet spot between detail and playability. I really like using the data cards, determining hit angles, comparing penetration values versus armor values and rolling for damage. I love the counters. I really like the mechanic of placing command counters and revealing them when the command is executed. While I have my issues with the initiative and sighting mechanics, I found it easy to implement changes that work seamlessly with the rest of the system. The result is exactly the kind of tank on tank game I've always wanted.

From my point of view the best WW2 tactical armor system. On one side of the spectrum there is ASL - primarily as infantry game with armor as support. On the side Panzer is the perfect tactical game with primary focus on vehicular combat while infantry still plays an important role.

Nice, fun to play tactical tank game.  Working way through the advanced rules.  My one complaint is the rules are confusingly worded and a little disorganized in my opinion.

Excellant simulation that captures the decisive nature of tank combat. He who fires first wins!

Igo-ugo nature did not work for us. With more and more tactical games going for impulses or chits it does not seems to be acceptable anymore. Also hexes are limiting nice to hit and penetration models because they are too limiting direction of impact.

RATING: 6
Excellent components & combat system.

Sighting, initiative and command systems do not function to best simulate reality OR good gameplay - most tank duels of equally matched tanks boil down to who wins the initiative d00 roll. Command allows far too many orders for any given formation, allowing most units over "seasoned" in quality to operate without fear of being out of command. Sighting system also seems cumbersome and unnecessary, when it should feel really important.

To add insult to injury, scenario design is uninspired, generally, and VCs or VP objectives are often insignificant in comparison to points from enemy casualties, so they become virtually inconsequential to the side with even the slightest of qualitative majorities.

As it comes out of the box, not a recommended system. Significant tweaks, including a wholesale rewrite of command, initiative and sighting, could elevate this game. As is, it's a five.

I purchased the main game and its two expansions.  First, the main game comes with only one mapsheet, so variety suffers.  The expansions come with mapboards that can be combined with each other.  However, the boards are extremely thin and are folded so they look like they belong in a ziplock bag "pocket game" like the first version of Steve Jackson's Ogre.

What is odd is the vehicle cards look to be twenty times the thinkness as the board.

The rule book's cover is the same thickness as the rest of the pages and is already prematurely showing signs of use.  My guess is GMT has "living rules" already posted for the game at its website, but I will have to check.

Overall, the game seems interesting, but the component quality is lacking, thus the rating is lower.

Great quality game. Traded ASL for this game. 
Great gameplay where you can decide the level of chrome you want, just by using the advanced rules or not. 
The map board is the only less appealing item, just a thin sheet of papet, not cardboard like the rest of the components, but nothing that can be solved with a piece of pexiglass on top. 
On overall, I'm really happy with the game.

I found this dense and rules difficult to parse and find. The stats on the cards could have been done better to be more intuitive. Production values are pretty good. Turret counters and maps are good but not great for the price. Given all my other games, I don't think this will hit the table again. Even with playing with people who are familiar with the system we were constantly hunting for rules. Fill give it one more play with an opponent before packing this one in. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game has been outstanding on its own and influenced a lot of other designs at tactical level. It stresses the tanks (or panzers for the German) operations, maneuvering to a best position to fire, within range and line of sight, at spotted enemy targets. The data cards for each and every tank demonstrate their characteristics and players are tested the ability to utilize the tanks to their best capabilities. 

The beginning pages of the rules talk a lot about spotting, line of sight and the relationship to the terrain and features on the map.  The system on checking line of sight for units at different heights is neat and very clever, the best among the tactical level wargames. The 5-commands chit system creates a sense of fog-of-war or suspense for that matter to the players as they do not know what are the commands the opposing side is giving.  What follows to happen is like a classic Hitchcockian movie.  

Some comments are made with regard to the change from plotting to sequential movement and fire (i.e. the basic I-go-You-go turn sequence) but I find no problem with it as it streamlines the game to an acceptable and yet realistic level.  There is even a rule that players can play the game in simultaneous turn in an "agreeable" manner. Besides, the initiative can shift from turn to turn by rolling D100 (made up of two dices), modified by scenario specific advantage.  I am comfortable with the change and the flow of the game still makes me feel the actions are being taken at the same time. 

All hail to the data cards!

This review is actually of the second printing of GMT's version of Panzer.  There may be some production differences from the first printing.  The GMT version does a good job of correcting the production flaws of the old Excalibre edition, but adds a few of its own, all minor.  First, the geomorphic maps went by the wayside in this version.  They came back in the expansion packs, but those in the first two expansion packs have an unnecessary split down their long axis.  Expansion pack 3 finally gets it right.  The map materials are fine, low glare and robust card stock, in all four games.  The expansion pack maps make more geographic sense than the base game map.  The other production glitch, in my copy at least, is that one of the map sheets was poorly cut, giving odd-sized pieces and clipped text.  I don't do much better myself with a paper cutter and a desk top publishing game, but still, this is GMT, they should do a bit better than that.  Everything else (artwork, rules clarity, scenario design, background material piece robustness, etc) is at or above GMT's normal high standards.  The data cards in particular are suitable for years of use.  They're so thick you could stop small shot with them.  The full set from all the expansions might just stop a 37mm round.

While the Panzer rules seem long, most of that reflects the designer's care in making everything as clear as possible, every place you might think to look.  And repeating most of what's on the player aid cards!  Once you get rolling, you discover that you only need to remember the basic procedures for spotting, movement (pretty standard) and two types of fire (armor piercing and general purpose).  All the hard-to-remember details are on the player aid cards.  GMT's complexity rating is right on target as a result.  Likewise, play is fast with even the largest scenarios doable in a day and the basic scenarios in an hour or two.

Overall, the Panzer system does a good job of both solo simulation and head-to-head cat-and-mouse (or hammer-scissors-paper, there's a bit of both involved in mobile combined arms combat).  Everything makes physical and tactical sense.  If you know how to command a battalion-sized task force, you know what to do.  You don't have to look for tricks and quirks lurking in the rules.

The only caveat with this series is that the expansion packs are just that, additional materials and scenarios for use with the main game.  Each expansion requires not only the main game but also the expansions that came before it.  The good news though, is that the scenario design materials are vast.  You can do-it-yourself forever once you've got all the maps and pieces.

Provisional rating after one day. I am an experienced MBT player and I like the changes here. The new way to work without turret counters is a much better approach to the company commander battle than before. Nice map, I do not miss geomorphic maps at all (box 1 anyway).

RATING: N/A
A great update to a classic series. It combines a huge amount of detail about weapons and equipment, shot angles, hit locations, ammunition types, etc. into a very playable chart system. I also like the command rules – very simple, but sufficiently restrictive: formations have to operate within the confines of particular orders (move, fire, short halt, overwatch) which are assigned before either player knows who has the initiative – this forces a certain amount of cautious anticipation and bet-hedging. The rules are clear and fairly straightforward, with a good balance between playability and technical accuracy. The modular approach to the rules also gets a lot of positive press. There has been much discussion about the influence of the initiative roll in this game, and while it may not be everybody’s cup of tea, the problems it causes have really been overstated. Needless to say, initiative provides a significant tactical advantage and players will have to ensure their plans can handle initiative swings.
 
The components are quite good, with one exception – the map. While functional, the map is ugly and terrain features seem to be scattered randomly about. Strange that in this day and age a publisher as successful as GMT still doesn’t fully appreciate the impact that a visually appealing map has on a war game. In addition, the expansion sets have modular geomorphic maps, but the base game does not, an inexplicable production choice.  
The focus of the base game as well as the two following expansions is the East front. 

Overall, a very good game that all tactical armour fans will want to check out.

Very simple question to ask yourself, if you are curious about whether or not you would like this game. Do you care to know the penetration value of a 88mm gun at 500 yds compared to the sloped frontal armor of a t34 76? If this sentence makes sense and you want to know the answer buy the game, if not stay away. Deep complex simulation of armoured and infantry warfare with all the bells and whistles you might dream of, not for the faint of heart, but fans of the genre will enjoy the richness.

Early rating, after playing with most of the advanced rules two games. The basic game is there, but it's not too interesting. On the plus side, it introduces some of the concepts (notably LOS, terrain, etc), and is quite easy to learn. The minus side for me, anyway, is that there are a couple of things to unlearn when you go to the advanced game, which led to some minor confusion for me. 

Lots of cool things in the armor game, including more realistic spotting and command and control than in most tactical games. ASL does armor pretty well, at least when it's a couple of tanks thrown in as support, but doesn't show much higher organization for larger organizations (outside of radioless vehicles, I can't think of anything). You will need to keep your companies together in this game. Not to knock ASL, which I do like, but in my experience most players use vehicles in that system in the most gamey way possible. There is far less allowance for that in Panzer. On the other hand, Panzer can sometimes seem a bit dry and academic with the penetration tables etc. In ASL there is a ton of dice rolling, but a lot of random, chaotic things can happen.

If you use all the advanced rules, this is a pretty detailed system. Quite a few optional rules, too, which players can pick and choose as desired. Some of these are low overhead and add quite a bit. 

I'm glad this was finally reprinted. I missed it the first time, and just waited for the p500 reprint. I picked up all the expansions as well. The first expansion is almost mandatory if you are going to play the system - adds a large amount of Soviet and German vehicles, and numerous geomorphic maps (the geomorphic maps are similar to the ASL SK style maps, but larger due to the 1" hexes, and folded a bit oddly due to their size. My only complaint is the extra folds, but I understand why it was necessary). 

Just one note on the controversial initiative system: at first glance it sounds awful - the side with initiative gets to fire all their units first?? In practice, though, IMO, it is not a big deal, and even tends to 'feel' right to me. It is only going to be decisive if players bum rush their tanks right in the face of the enemy, and then lose the initiative roll. That is just getting what one deserves. In any case, there is an optional rule to make initive more granular...not sure it's an improvement, but it is in the game for players who want to use it.

Play-tested MBT.  Excellent squad-/individual-vehicle level game.  As written, you can layer on as much or as little rules density as you like. It lacks some of the chaos / chrome of ASL, but is otherwise one of the top tactical games available, IMO.

I find this game utterly odd - unlike anything I have played before. nevertheless I will stick with it, having foolishly invested in both the base game and the two expansions. 
When I say 'odd' I mean the mechanics are new to me and different to the usual in tank games. Will update at a later date when I have gained more experience. The research and components are good which explains the rating.

RATING: 8
Nice counter artwork, though the maps are a little Panzerblitz / Combat Commander looking and while clean, a bit more texture might have made them a bit more atmospheric.

The system is detailed and although I am at the start of the journey with this game, I am hoping that the 'fullness' of the system will be a rewarding tactical experience.

At the time of release two Russian expansions were also printed to give the entire kit for the East Front.

Since then, the 3rd expansion for the west '44 - '45 has been released and France 40 is in the production pipeline, so the system has some traction.

Tentative rating after having played three scenarios - Basic and Advanced game with vehicles only.

The game physical components are first class: I really appreciate the large and easy-to-punch counters. Data cards on heavy card stock are handy and the map has interesting features to begin with...

The rules:

They come in three parts: Basic, Advanced and Optional: If the Basic rules are simple enough, the Advanced rules are really complex. Even thought they're supposed to be "à la carte", they are NOT presented in a way that enable the gamers to assimilate them step by step, with specific scenarios: You know, the style: "STOP! You have learned enough to play scenario X!" If, for instance, I just want to play the Advanced game with vehicles units, I still have to search what I'm supposed to read and what I may temporarily bypass... Not an easy task!

The scenarios: we played scenario 1, 2 and 5. If scenarios 1 and 2 seem balanced enough for their learning purpose, scenario 5 need optional rules to help the outnumbered Soviets, IMHO!

The game:

I enjoyed it! Both sides have their strengths and weaknesses. Skillfully assigning orders to your units is a key element, but gamers who like predictable outcomes will be frustrated: Winning initiative is paramount, especially when the battle reaches its "critical point"! A little bit of luck is necessary, here! But it's not the end of it: You also need some luck to hit your target, at a location where your ammunition penetrates and, at last, you need a good Damage DR: So, luck is widely distributed and I like that!

I also like the way orders channel the actions on the  battlefield: No arbitrary and artificial phases to allow units to respond to a new menace: If you didn't plan with enough flexibility (mainly using the Over Watch order) you might well loose the battle: This is GREAT!

Even if this game has a somewhat steep learning curve, I'm ready to take this path to explore the game in its details and subtleties: I will definitely play it again!

The game and expansions arrived in Okinawa! Very impressive package. I am stunned that everything is included. Nits...the geomorphic maps are really cut funny, I do not like the scenario layouts, for some reason I prefer Squad Leader's, maybe more infantry counters, and it would be nice to have a manifest of what counters are on the back of what counters. Not nits...the complete Eastern Front package! This one has all the tools for you to create your own scenarios quite easily. This is a very high quality, and surprisingly inexpensive, package. No black and white cards that you cut out yourself. Everything is in full glorious color! The counters are huge!! I pulled out an ASL box yesterday and realized that I could never play that are again. The counters are just too small! It's too much for the boxes that it came in! This was entirely worth the wait!!! Thank you GMT for selling us a complete game system! Please get the Western Front up on P500 soon!

Game is a little more interesting than MBT because the tank combat is not quite so lethal at long ranges. Still, like MBT, tanks have no rate of fire. So, a Tiger tank could only get off one shot a turn against a swarm of enemy tanks. Also, the initiative rules mean that one side may get to shoot twice in a row if the initiative dice rolls give the initiative to the same side in a row.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Sounds like a great Tobruk-like armor game (in terms of scale and detail) but perhaps easier to learn/teach and great modern components in the reprint. Also, this is Eastern Front (vs Tobruk's North African setting), so, uh, I need both.

UPDATE: the more I read, the more I want this game. This might supplant Tobruk as one of my favorite wargames.

UPDATE: finally got to play this - love it, definitely scratches that Tobruk itch, but with more detail that I like, and honestly, not really that much more complexity so far. Provisional rating of 9.

This is my first old-school style war-game. I've been playing so many contemporary titles; from High Frontier, Many CDG's, COIN's, Combat Commander, that I wanted something heavy in detail, nuanced and modular. I love WWII era armor, and at the moment my only other armor title is Fighting Formations. Panzer is in it's own style league, not as fiddly as ASL yet just as historical, detailed and accurate. One of the cool things with Panzer is the ability to modulate advanced/optional rules to meet your own personal level of detail. It's taken a fair amount to learn the system, this is not your contemporary design where all questions are answered via the map and/or player aid cards, there's a ton of info here but if you give it some time the rewards are endless!

I have played with the basic rule only.
Somehow neither me nor my gaming buddy could be motivated to try the advanced rules.
Initiative is everything. The best "tactic" seems to be just to drive in the midst of the enemy formation and hoping to win the initiative roll next turn. This way, terrain, cover and armor do not play any role anymore.

Components are excellent. However there are significant structural problems. Initiative, command, and spotting rules require work. I am interested in giving this system a few more plays as the combat system is well done.

RATING: 7
Beautiful components.  Inexcusable amount of typos and numerous grammatical errors due to poor proofreading and quality control.

Have now played the game twice this past weekend; our group had a pretty good time with it and had very favorable comments afterwards.  After a one-on-one with another player, we too had a pretty good time and quickly climbed the learning curve (i.e. Spotting Rules) in just those two plays we had.  So far the feeling amongst those I have played this game with is very positive and everyone looks forward to more play.

Update: June, 2014

I have played more of this game and really enjoy it.  It's definitely fun and offers good challenges.  That said, I can't raise my rating.  For those who never played Jim's Yaquinto version, you'll find it a great system and loads of entertainment.  But for those of us who DID play those original games (and I played the hell out of 'em back in the day), you will simply not find this streamlined version of those games satisfying.  Mark Stumptner makes a very good point when he reveals the fact that fire combat results are not simultaneous as was the original system.  And that simply does not wash.  

Everything about Jim's new editions screams faster and simpler play, something I suspect GMT made a pre-requisite in order to publish, as GMT is known for this kind of gaming system for the greater part of their releases.  I don't have a problem with that. Games are a business first for those who publish.  And today's board game market is definitely far more in tune with that sort of game than not.  So mine is not a complaint.

But even as good as the GMT versions are, I would recommend that you bite the bullet and buy any of the Yaquinto original editions if you desire to play what is considered by most as the very best tank-on-tank game system ever designed. 

The editions, while sharing much in common are decidedly different, beginning with ground scale of 50 meters compared to 100 meters. And that makes them incompatible, something I can't help but think was intentional in order to prevent using the original Data Cards with the new system.  Of greater importance is the fact that Yaquinto is plotted movement and simultaneous fire and there are far more hit possibilities on the first edition data cards.  Beyond that, much remains the same in design if not actual practice. But those two aspects are no small matter! And they make both playing the game as well as the player's considerations of strategy different as well. And while many will proclaim anything using plotted movement as a death sentence for modern board gaming, I find I not only prefer it here, but consider all of those markers required to mark orders and track unit activity far more fiddly and irritating than writing orders.

I am not suggesting you choose one or the other.  In fact I suggest the opposite and that you consider buying both editions. If you like the GMT streamlined version, you're sure to love the originals.

Update: May 3, 2015

I just read Jim Day's design blog on GMT which I had not previously read.

Jim makes a very clear case for his design changes between Yaquinto, AH and GMT versions.  But in so doing he also reinforces my original complaint that these changes were dictated by yielding to the changing market for complex boardgaming, and successful releases at the expense of original design goals and intent. 

Another supposed advantage of the new design is the ability to create larger battles that sim-move written orders games admittedly prohibit.  Personally, I've never given a care to such considerations. But somehow that's suppose to be another item high on the new gaming communities list.  Perhaps. I've also seen eight foot tables of ASL at Expo. But I never heard of any demands that ASL be re-tuned for such wants.

Why is detail such a bad words these days with current designers or publishers?  Yes, I know. The answer lies in financial success. And who can begrudge publishers that basic need? Certainly not I.  But detail and complexity still has it's place.  Again, ASL certainly has a strong following. And the original Yaquinto titles never approached anything like ASL in complexity. I would also point to GMT themselves who have published titles like A World at War, EFS, GBACW, TiTE, Empire of The Sun and others.  All of these are clearly in the detailed and complex camp.  

So just who are these new gamers who would not be interested in detailed, sim-move WWII tactical gaming? And if they are such a market force, why have the aforementioned GMT titles been published in what would obviously appear to be a clear violation of that new publishing credo? Yes, everyone in my group or that I game with is almost always over fifty.  But I have also had the chance to try and get Flames of War kids interested in Jim's simplified Panzer. And they all frowned at the detail of this scaled-down version all while toting around a thick hardbound rules book!  And they never once made the case that it was because they were not boardgamers. So I find this demographic argument to ring hollow for me. Again, I am just one wargamer invoking personal anecdotes. Still, I find myself unable to visualize who this new crowd of gamers who supposedly would be excited to play WWII tactical tank and infantry games but who accept only simplified systems are supposed to be. The only thing that comes to mind for me are the Euro gamers. And I presume that is not the group to which reference is being made.

So I just don't buy the argument that we must have a simplified new edition of what was clearly one of the great WWII tactical systems.  There are many who will never be able to afford to buy the original series games and as a result will never be able to experience Jim's original design. And that's unfortunate. And no one should have to invest in the inferior Excalibur editions to get there.

So rather than just complaining, I'd like to offer a solution and challenge to Jim and GMT; a supplemental reissue of only the original Yaquinto series rules, C&T's, data cards and wheels. Perhaps also some modular terrain overlays? Future expansions could exapnd upon this as well. No, I haven't thought it through entirely or very deeply.  And perhaps I'm overlooking things as of yet unseen. But it would seem to me that with the counters and maps already provided by the new series, GMT could do a small (ziplock?) release which would offer series fans the option to experience the real deal alternative? It could even be updated to incorporate new improvements fleshed out in GMT's games. Certainly the P500 program would weed out this idea if found to be pure folly. But if in instead it proved viable, it would certainly enhance, expand and improve the family of games created by Jim Day.

Thanks for reading a rant by an old grognard.

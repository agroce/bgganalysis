What can I say? It's Fluxx. Fluxx can either be a great time or the most boring game of the evening. I do enjoy the theme though.

RATING: 7
Good Fluxx flavor. I love the use of Creepers in this version. Great for Lovecraft fans and Fluxx fans alike. Probably my favorite Fluxx next to original recipe.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is too slow for my liking. It might be faster if it were "Play 1, Draw 1." I suggest a timer for "End of the World" feel. Recommendation: We Didn't Playtest This at All - Chaos Pack
Pro: The last few games have been extremely short. I enjoy the Action and New Rule cards.

Destroyed in 10/17 house fire.

RATING: 8
Very easy to learn. Most fun with several players. Can get completely insane when your drawing 4 cards a turn and a play all hits the field.

Ungoals add that extra fun of rooting for the enemy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
filler game, which does require reading each card.
The rules and way to win the game is changing so much you might think it's impossible to win, but it feeling also changes with every new rule being added/changed.

RATING: 5
A near pitch perfect edition of Fluxx. Great mechanics, fun gameplay, inside jokes a plenty, there is nothing to dislike here. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Played a game once where an ungoal was completed, one player had the cultist, the other the secret cultist and the promo Traitor card was in play. It was one of the greatest Flux moments ever as we scratched our heads trying to figure out if someone had won or not.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
The worst Fluxx, which is in itself a not very good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This just replaced Star Fluxx as my favorite version. Granted there is a significant absence of strategy (as all versions of Fluxx suffer from) but the flavor of this version allows it more room to breathe. The "surprise, everyone lost" moments are the best parts, frankly. It allows the deck to become a player in the game, so to speak, instead of only "what can I do TO ANOTHER player".

The added Meta-Rule gives it a little variation from the other FLUXX titles I've tried, the artwork is not going to be up to par with a lot of Lovecraft games, but the bonkers rules of the card game are surprisingly apt with this theme.

It's Cthulhu, what's not to like!   Ok honestly, bar the theme, I don't think the game itself is all that exciting due to the lack of surprises and interesting rule changes.

Great to kill some time though, especially with other Mythos fans.

This is essential in that it expands the mythos and the stories to tell. If you like a storytelling game then you are going to want this to build it out a bit more.

Ugh really?  I am waiting for Munchkin Flux so I can Die the most painful death imaginable!!!

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

This game will easily displace Martian Fluxx as my favorite Fluxx game. The Doom-based un-goals and the Secret Cultist are excellent mechanisms that really set this one apart from its predecessors and anchor it firmly in its theme. There are definitely humorous touches, but there's also a flavor of the genuine macabre.

Most mechanically heavy and complex Fluxx to date.  Lots to pay attention to, lots of moving parts, and lots of info to track.  Definitely not for kids, families, or the elderly.  Ungoals are the core mechanic of this set, using them like no Fluxx has abused them before.  Gameplay is consistently shorter than other Fluxxes, but individual turns take longer.

Cthulhu Fluxx introduces some interesting mechanics, such as the un-goals and the like. However, the extreme randomness inherent to the game's design and the unbalanced nature of certain options means Cthulhu Fluxx only gets pulled off the shelf when the stars are right.

None of my friends are terribly excited about this game, and those who've played the Monty Python version like me find the latter more fun... The cartoony art style doesn't complement Lovecraft very well, either. Still an okay game, though!

Technically this is my daughter's. She likes it better than Zombie Fluxx.  It is a little more complicated but it comes with a little stronger theme.  Sometimes it seems like you are playing against the game as much as each other.  That would explain the inclusion of the Cult Clash Meta Rule.

Cthulhu Fluxx is a quick luck-of-the-draw game where the rules change in almost every turn.  It has a fast/chaotic pace and games usually last about 10 min.  I do enjoy this as a filler and the Lovecraftian theme works very well for how insane Fluxx can get.  I love that it seems like anything can happen at any moment.  It scratches that itch when I want something fast, easy, and totally strange.

Having recently read about 20 HP Lovecraft stories and developing a minor interest in the Cthulhu mythos, I just had to get this game even though I don't care for Fluxx.  It's a slight improvement over Fluxx, and for those who have read the stories, the themes is good, but in the end it's still Fluxx.  We own this and Monty Python Fluxx for the same reason we own about 5 differently-themed Monopoly games.

It's Cthulhu. It's flux. Both are represented fairly well here, and I don't think that is a good thing - so take something that is rich and complicated x something that excels in making a simple set of rules needlessly complicated, and you end up with something that is excessively complicated.

The one version of Fluxx I've played that I love. Unlike the other versions, this one adds a few new elements of ungoals (where everyone can lose) & creepers (which have to be played & count against the player). With these elements & the crazy things normal to Fluxx of playing many cards, it is like playing some kind of balancing act where you can avoid the problems falling around you or have all of it fall on your head. If looking at a light party game with a horror theme, it is a good one.

Cthulhu Fluxx is my favorite version thus far.  Two reasons for this are (1) the theme and (2) it's a more complex Fluxx.  The Ungoals in this game are excellent really keeping with the theme and who doesn't enjoy Secret Cultists.

I love the brilliant idea of Fluxx - a game that needs no rulebook.
However the gameplay itself is lacking; as another user aptly stated - the decisions you make are either forced or obvious.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Mimo wielu ciekawych pomysłów gra jest dość słaba.
Rzadko stoją przed nami prawdziwe dylematy, większość decyzji jest albo oczywista albo wymuszona.
Gra powinna być niezła jako rozrywka imprezowa, dzięki elementom społecznej interakcji.
Akcja może np. pozwalać na zabranie karty innemu graczowi jeśli potrafimy powiedzieć czego ta osoba się boi.

This was one of my first purchases and I was reading a lot of Lovecraft at the time. I liked the constantly changing rules and objectives but I wish I had picked a more universal theme. I find it hard getting it to the table as my group do not want to play this version.

Cthulhu Fluxx is my favorite edition of Fluxx. It involves a greater degree of strategy than all other versions I've played, but not so much strategy that the core of what makes Fluxx fun is eliminated.

I give this variant the highest rating I can bring myself to give a game in the Fluxx series.

Appropriately, there is a large number of Creepers in the Cthulhu variant. While this is a problem in the Zombie variant, the Cthulhu variant remedies this with numerous ways to win the game with Creepers, including an optional "Meta Rule" which actually rewards a player for trying to go out with lots of evil creatures in play.

But still, it's Fluxx. Read my other reviews of Fluxx variants and you'll know how I feel about this one.

If you're a Fluxx-hating Cthulhu Geek, I can't even begin to tell you whether the coolness of the Cthulhu theme will overcome your distaste of Fluxx.  But there are some game elements that tie into the Cthulhu theme that aren't present in any other Fluxx, so it is more thematic than you might think at first glance.  Update: One of the people I played it with said the additional elements make it more gamer friendly than vanilla Fluxx.  YMMV.

Played this back before I was too into board games. It was my first fluxx game, and I enjoyed it. The cards were less text heavy than Eldritch Horror, and I enjoyed the artwork. I am a Lovecraft purist, and this game kept it from feeling like fan fiction by limiting the amount of text on the cards.

Arguably the best incarnation of Fluxx: The new mechanics here (particularly the Un-Goals of Doom that cause everyone to lose) add a great deal of flavor and interest to the game. It still suffers from the perennial Fluxx problem of the game outlasting its welcome and dragging on and on and on, but perhaps less so than the other installments. And it still benefits greatly from the virtue of being incredibly easy to teach. (From zero to playing in 20 seconds flat.)

Expansion for Fluxx with Cthulhu theme.  Adds additional way to end the game, in failure.

We found Fluxx (including Cthulhu Fluxx) to have too much down time between players, and too much randomness and very little control to make the game fairly boring.  Traded away.

Its a little bit better than it's relatives, but honestly all Fluxx games are excercises in frustration and randomness on levels that likes most games can't even dream of. The Cthulhu skin had some advantages with the Doom mechanic in the game, but essentially this just adds a layor of even more randomness to the game making it just as unenjoyable as its kin.

Fluxx with a twist. The creepers add another layer to the game and don't complicate things too much. I use Fluxx to initiate non-gamers, since there is nothing easier to learn. I probably wouldn't use Cthulhu or Zombie Fluxx to teach a brand new gamer.

11/2012 Making a good filler even better. This reincarnation of Fluxx adds a (very subjective) excellent theme along with some added rule twists. The game is still true to the Fluxx chaotic simplicity, only better.

A fun game with a constantly changing goal. Plays well with 2 players but as always more players adds a lot of variety and challenge to the game. Each play is unique and we have had games as fast as 15 minutes or as long as an hour or more, it really depends on how cut throat the players are willing to be, and the more you allow yourself to be that way the more variety it opens up.

First type of Fluxx games I have played.  When the winning conditions to the game change frequently, it removes any kind of strategy to plan for.  Some tactical games I thoroughly enjoy, but this one was not as much tactical as it was complete utter randomness.

I know and I understand why Fluxx gets such a bad rap, it's not really the most strategic immersive game ever made.  

Actually, it's much more like-- deal out cards... Play them... And hang on for dear life till someone lucks out and wins. 

Where Fluxx succeeds is that the rules are easy (or deceptively so) and therefore easy to introduce to players.  "Yeah, it's easy... Draw a card and than play it!"

I just could not get into this version. It wasn't the Cthulhu related content that deterred me, but the amount of times I had to go searching through the deck! In 15 minutes I already had to search and find four different cards and reshuffle the deck! It's just a hassle and boring. I like the idea of the ungoals, but the rest just made it less of a fun filler game and more of a "pay strict attention to the millions of rules" game. I quit once I hit the fifth "search the the deck and find this..." card. Too much!

Compared to basic Fluxx v4, the cards have a lot more interaction and text. We're not terribly fond of the "look through the discard pile and deck to find card(s) X (and Y)" cards as they really slow things down, especially if you had to look through the deck and then had to reshuffle. We've House Ruled these so if the card isn't in someone's hand or the discard pile, then you put the card that triggered it next to you and if the card is still active when the target card(s) show up, the action/rule applies at that time.

There are a lot more Creeper cards and not enough ways to get rid of them so we've also House Ruled that if you match with a Goal that requires a Creeper, the OTHER Creepers don't keep you from winning (I wouldn't be surprised if most people play Fluxx this way anyway).

Starting this at 7.5. We "tolerate" (enjoy) the chaos of Fluxx play because it's quick, easy, and fun. Cthulhu Fluxx is just a bit more cumbersome and plays a bit longer and therefore threatens to overstay its welcome.

If I'mg going to mindlessly flip cards over, it's a definite plus if they make good references to Lovecraft.  I'm still not a super fan of Fluxx, but a well integrated theme goes a long way in making it a more tolerable activity for luring people into the world of boardgames.

Also, I feel that Fluxx has gone downhill (from a low starting point) with the introduction of creepers, since they merely lengthen a game that is at its best when it is extremely short.  Cthulhu Fluxx has ameliorated that issue with ungoals that end the game in a total loss.  They are not the most satisfying conclusion, but they are thematic but (most importantly) they do end the game.

Adding two for the theme. The Goals make better sense with the Keepers (the Goals are often titles of stories, and the Keepers are characters), but that's about all I like about the game. The cards are on the complex side for this sort of game -- you have to do stuff like count icons, know the game terms, etc. etc. Munchkins will end up reading everyone's displayed cards, since most Keepers have a special effect on gameplay.

Admittedly, I'm biased because I like both Lovecraft and Fluxx. However, this (and Monty Python) is by far the best Fluxx version as the theme actually fits the chaos of Fluxx. Also, despite what people say, there is clear strategy to the game. Yes, the game is still based on luck to some (a large) degree, but you can absolutely maximize your chances with smart play (as an example, if you only have one of two cards needed for a goal, don't play the goal card).

There's nothing here that isn't already present in normal Fluxx. It more or less plays itself, and is really only interesting for as long as you can remain amused by the idea that the "rules" can change mid-game. The humor is in the content, which at least doesn't execute in a ham-handed way. It's also sometimes fun to see how hard you can abuse your holdings.

It's light and easy, which deserves some credit, and during the right lunar phase given the right crowd I might be willing to play this. But most of the time I just don't feel like entertaining it as an option.

I never played the original Fluxx but I picked this up because I like the Cthulhu theme. This is an easy game to pick up and play and pretty easy to learn.

Again I've never played the original and probably need to play more or find a good forum.

As with other Fluxx games, the game is fairly unpredictable and is very luck reliant. I would not play this expecting to match my skills against other card players. However, it's a fine party game, and the many themes mean you can always find a deck that satisfies everyone at the table.

Simple rules (at the beginning at least) and with a great deal of chaotic fun.

The downtime can be a pain though, as you can see the others play "Draw 4, Play 3" or "Play All" and so forth, and in your turn the rules changed so that all you can do is, well, play 1 and pass. For this reason, I found that the 3 players game works a lot better than the 4+.

Artwork is really good, but the box could be a little bigger (so that the cards could be sleeved and still fit in it).

It is basicaully as bad as any other Fluxx, but the theme works better for me, and with more ways for the game to end, it tends to finish sooner than others - for both of these reasons, [thing=122159][/thing] gets a better rating.

I wasnt expecting such a light game. So i was very underwhelmed. However, when viewed through a different perspective its a light filler with the interesting mechanism of changing rules although, the actual game play is dull and uninteresting.

A random, chaotic, mess of a game! But quite a lot of fun for the short time it takes to play it. If youre really competative then do everyone a avour and dont bother with this game. You'll turn into a complete whiner when the rules change and the goals reverse. No one likes a whiner...

Excellent theme based Fluxx. One of the most complex with most variables. No knowledge of Lovecraft required

I think Cthulhu and Fluxx go together like Ben and Jerry! Great fun filler. Also great litmus test if your new game buddy has humour or is a sour WAAC.

Possibly even less fun that regular Fluxx. We play for a while, an Old One appears, we all lose except the guy who has the "I win" card.

Best Fluxx expansion I've seen yet. Ungoals are great addition; secret cultist is fun everytime I draw it.

Sometimes the game can be amazing fun, other times it just descends into madness, with one player playing 30+ cards and both of you ending up bored.

Mindless, chaotic luckfest and extremely annoying mess of a game. Playing Cthulhu Fluxx  with 6 players causes a huge amount of downtime as there's way too much card reading. There's no way to plan anything - the rules are constantly changing, cards are being stolen or redistributed among the players all the time. A complete waste of time. Terrible game, I actively hate it.

ugh, I bought this because I like HP Lovecraft and fluxx is okay, but holy crap this game is boring, and unless you play with other fans its terrible.

I got a renewed interest in Fluxx after watching this episode of Will Wheaton's 'Tabletop' webseries: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6C1CBXPvc
I played the original Fluxx once but didn't think much of it. However, these themed versions look like a lot more fun. I got Cthulhu Fluxx from Secret Santa 2014.

This is a great 2 players game! More unleashes chaos! But with 2 players it´s full of flavor and strategy. A lot of fun!

When the need arises for a nonthinking random game, this fits.

I played this with basically everyone. I guess my best memory of this was with my boyfriend on the train. The first train I went on for a trip (unless you count that one time in Colorado where my family and I went to the tallest mountain in that State). We played that and Once Upon a Time on those small tables on the back of the chairs. (Oh wait, that was actually my boyfriend's Batman version, oops).

I like the randomness and weirdness of this game at times and this theme appealed most. Ultimately a decent filler with the right people (usually early teens sort of age) but for a game filled with random craziness, I do prefer Munchkin.

It's the same chaotic Fluxx gameplay but with the watered-down Mythos setting we see on so many contemporary games. Unimpressive.

While I can't speak for the entirety of original Fluxx decks, there is a nice aspect to the three decks published in Poland: every one of them provides a slightly different gameplay. The Cthulhu one is about trying to win and not let the game win -- unless someone else is about to! Also, you never know if the Secret Cultist isn't lurking...

Probably the best version of Fluxx I've played. Lots of Lovecraft references, which is great if you've read all the famous stories. I love the new types of cards: "Ungoals" (if conditions are met, everyone loses!) and "Surprises" (can be used out of turn for special rules-bending).

Fluxx games just aren't for me. They don't really feel like games because the game is so chaotic that nothing you do feels at all tactical or like you are making progress.

Fluxx ist ein Spiel, bei dem es null auf Können ankommt, sondern nur aufs Kartenglück. Das mag ich eigentlich gar nicht... aber ich muss zugeben, dass der plötzliche Regelwechsel ganz witzig ist.

Fluxx games are fun to play but usually only want to play a few games then move on to a different game.  Very chaotic but fun.  Great if you only have a short period of time to play.

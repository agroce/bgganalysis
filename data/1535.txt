RATING: 7
Pros:
Fun! Simple rules. New gamer/family friendly. Essentially a luckless game (except when you overshoot a corner and have to roll a dice to see what happens). Much better than Formula D. The board looks nice (1st edition).

Cons:
Only the one track (shame there isn't another track on the other side of the board). The track splits in two in places which is not realistic (but arguably more fun?).

Remember pestering my Dad for this! He got me the current (1964) version and found he enjoyed as much as I did. It certainly got played a lot! I've still got the game and think it holds up well today. I like the fact you can go as fast as you like and it isn't dice driven- apart from finding out how much damage has been incurred taking a corner too quickly!

'Formula 1' and Milton Bradley 'Dogfight' were the most played games of my childhood. Countless games, fabulous times.

Just re-aquired a copy of this - it needs just a little maintenance, but is destined for a lot of action.

Simple and elegant, you really feel like you are racing your car.

I bought this years ago in a charity shop for £1, but only played it for the first time this weekend. I loved it, so did my son (8). 

I notice that a number of people comment that it needs, or is improved by, extra tracks. Has anyone ever designed one, and is there a way of making them available online? I guess there must be a knack to good track design.

I played this game alot as a child. It was my first racing games and one of the first games I'd ever played where your pawn's movement didn't rely on the roll of dice. The use of "dashboard" player boards added alot to the overall theme of the game.

I have many fond memories of this game.

Light and fun family car racing game. Mechanics of controlling your speed and consuming brakes and tyres works quite well. Luck plays a part, but more to make it interesting and close rather than spoil strategies. Must be played with at least four players such that blocking and overtaking become critical elements of the game.

Really not a bad race game at all.  The pit stop is sort of random and the turn order stays the same so that leads to some blocking issues but it's not bad. No dice for movement...only when you take a turn faster than recommended.  Considering this is from 1963 it's really solid.

I personally like other race games more.

If there is a larger group of people (5-6) this is the first game I want to pull out.  Of course then again, people seem to frown upon ancient racing games from the 60s, so I sadly never get to play it.  But still, it's my favorite racing game out there and I love the old cars.  You definitely have to add the rule variant in which the person in 1st place moves first.

Probably released before the time when it would have been recognised as something a bit special.  In a period when the dice ruled, to have a game where you decided how far you would move and the dice were relegated to those occasions when you actually were 'taking a chance' was unusual.  More tracks would have helped the game, I believe.

It's pretty good- the effect of the fixed turn order can be pretty brutal and it adds a little more detail to the SPEED CIRCUIT chassis this thing rides on but for some reason it seemed to lack drama.  The dashboards are pretty cool, though.

Don't let the dated appearance fool you. This is an excellent racing game.  It's the predecessor to Speed Circuit. It uses a clever Dash Board mechanic to maintain and easily visualize all the cars resources and speed. A fixed turn order with careful use can force an opponent to make a less than optimum move. And a selection of Tactic cards.  Very simple to learn.  A nice caveat : Almost any of Speed Circuits tracks can easily be converted for play in this game!

Excellent racing game that I really loved in my schooldays. I can still remember tearing into that final lap just ahead of my more cautious opponents, with virtually no effective brakes and tyres left! The use of the dashboard speedo device to set your speed rather than the simple throw of a dice makes Formula 1 virtually unique and puts it above the Formule Dé series in my opinion. Will check out those charity shops to see if I can find another copy.  **Just found a copy yesterday!  It is the late 1970's Waddington's version with the "jigsaw" board and somewhat inferior components, but still a great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
678- this game just turned 50 and still gains high regard from people who enjoy racing games. I think the design of the play mechanism was excellent and the difference was not using dice for movement. It can be played w/ adults and kids and is very challenging w/ 6 players. A special feature is the use of large dashboards for each driver!

Love the Dashboards.  Hate the Monopoly jalopies.  The trick of this game is to cross the finish line having; used all five Bonus cards, destroyed your brakes and running on bald tires that will pop when you fish tail your car to a stop before you fly into the grand stand at the end of the straightaway.  Getting to this condition before the finish line means you crash and burn. Having anything left as you cross the finish line means that you will be the best of all the LOSERS, that is 2nd place.

RATING: 6.5
A surprisingly tidy game with almost no luck, since there's no dice. Innovative for its time. The board makes it look like a more simplistic version of "Formula D" but with the way the dials work for movement, you still have a similar level of strategy to run the race. Kind of a niche game, though, that I think gets eclipsed by the level of detail you can get into with "Formula D".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent mixture of skill and luck.  In most ways similar to Speed Circuit, Formula-1 adds a bit of chaos in the form of tactics cards and pitstops to make what I consider to be a better game for those additions.

As a kid I was so excited by this game that I drew my own board based on the French Le Mans circuit (sadly now lost). For decades this was as good as any other racing game out there, Ave Caesar was similar without the chance cards, but Snow Tails has now made this redundant for me.

It is clearly better to be the first person to move, as it seemed the players moving last had a greater chance of being cut off by someone who moves earlier in the order.  I will happily play again, but will suggest we keep it down to 6 cars at most.  Seems like a 4-lap race is enough to see some tire/brake concerns and a few pit stops.  The most recent playing we implemented a move by track position rule, which seemed like an improvement.

Childhood favourite (my dad's old copy - I'm not that old).

Played to bits as kids - classic racing game. Ahead of its time in having players determine their own speed and associated risks, and the predecessor of Formula De in having each car measure its tyre wear and brake wear with consequences for running out. Turn order is important, and I think I prefer running in race order rather than the implied clockwise order given in the rules (leads players to take more risk to get to the front for clear air). Players get to choose whether to run slow and risk nothing, or go faster through the corners and wear the risk of spinning out or getting tyre wear or brake wear. Winning strategies are something in between. There's a nice balance of luck and calculation.

RATING: 6
As a 3-player game the interactions are too weak to make this much more than parallel solitaire.  The luck of the dice control the outcome when players take equal risks but taking those risks is a matter of strategy. More players are probably better, with 6 this game would probably rate a 7. Has many of the features that are included in Formula De (except the 'gear dice'). Might suggest getting one free Tactics Card with every lap completed and 2 for a pit stop.

Missing box, board and game components only. Picked it up because of the similarity to Speed Circuit. Pit cards are interesting, but hard to get this one on the table with SC, Formula D, and Daytona 500 lurking.

Without a doubt the best racing game available. The whole thing is clever, inventive, and still fresh more than two decades after I first played it. If you don't own a copy hunt one out. Building new tracks isn't even that difficult, so you can give it the variety that other better supported games have.

Innovative for its time where you decide the movement of your car, not by dice roll.  Clever use of wear recording and nonlinear distribution for over-cornering.

Descendant of LeMans and ancestor of the legendary Speed Circuit.

I really like the way you can control your speed to determine the number of spaces moved, but apart from that major innovation it feels pretty dated.  The tactics cards are very boring - their flavor (slipstreaming, superb driving, etc.) is usually meaningless, as most of the cards just add 2-4 spaces.  There's a lot of downtime - it really needs some way to have players simultaneously determine their speed and wing it, using brakes if a player cuts in front of them or tires if they have to take a tight line. The worst is that players go clockwise, rather than from the front to the back.   But even after 50 years, the dashboards are very high quality, competitive with any modern day components.  I still need to play Speed Circuit, which might build upon what F1 did well and address some of these issues.

Absolutely brilliant game that captures the feel of a motor race really well. Improves greatly if there are enough laps so that it is necessary to pit at least once. Clever use of dice.

The grand-daddy of ALL car racing games. HUGELY innovative for it's time. The dice in the box NOT used for movement was a great leap forward. Naturally, it has been overtaken by later developments, but for it's superb innovation it would be in a "Hall of Fame" for games if such a thing existed (and such a thing should!) The idea of controlling the car with a car "dashboard" was just so cool for the boy I was when I got this game. If I were rating it back in the 1960s it would be a 10 - no 11! For old time's sake I'll give it an 8 now - for it's time, a design classic.

There are far worse racing games out there.  Other than the problems of the occassional runaway leader and dice that just won't behave, it can be quite enjoyable.  Best played with the full six.

Another game from the 1970s. I used to play against my brother. Dashboards & dials are used for movement and recording tyre-wear and brake-wear. Dice are used for hazards. Hugely enjoyable.

A game ahead of its time, as its based on real strategy. So good, AH based Speed Circuit on it. Not really my thing, cars, but an underrated classic anyhow.

In the interest of full disclosure, I'm not a huge fan of race games. That said, I found Formula One to be more tedious than most. Turn order (which stays the same throughout regardless of position on the track) doesn't work well, the pit cards are unbalanced to the point of being silly (one player might lose two turns while another loses no time and gets a bump up in speed). Mainly, I just found this to be slow and uninspired.

Again happy childhood memories of this game although as kids we used to always get frustrated by the blocking elements of the strict movement order for cars. Our first ever house rules for a game soon sorted that - lead car moves first and so on back down the field. Playing now however, blocking is just one of the many simple mechanics of the game that adds to the fun !

I love this game - bluff,calculation,strategy and luck all play a part.  As a kid with 3 friends we set up a Grand Prix season using the Waddingtons game as a base . We combined 2 games to give 4 teams of 2 cars each and designed our own tracks on some old A0 cartridge paper we found -named after the famous circuits and with an staggered 8 car grid . Fantastic fun and the 2nd car added a great deal to the game play as by coordinating the 2 cars it was far easier to baulk opponents. The only problem was our self designed tracks had too great a lap length and with 8 cars it took  too long to complete a lap. This meant the pit stop element rarely played a part as we had to abandon many games after running out of time. The previous weeks result determined the grid order for the next race . Happy days

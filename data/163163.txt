1st play: Very similar to Thunder Alley, and I actually like these cars a little better.  The track is a lot narrower, and the cars have higher numbers.  Thunder Alley runs in 2 laps, but because of the higher speeds, it seems like they increased the laps.  This makes the game a bit too long, and that's what makes it not quite as good as Thunder Alley.  I really like the NPC team cars, it allows for interesting strategies where those cars are used to push your scoring cars.  

No 2nd play.  I actually like the game just fine, it's just that Thunder Alley is better and the two are so similar that anytime I'd play Grand Prix, I'd just play Thunder Alley instead.

The system fits better the Nascar. Even if including F1 specific rules this one misses completely the feeling of a F1 race. Maybe could fit MotoGP or professional cycling....

This game has a completely different feel than Thunder Alley.  Not better but different.  It is a much shorter game to play.  Which is ironic since a Grand Prix race has more laps than a Thunder Alley race.  The cars really fly around  the track.  My wife and I just did a three lap race in three turns.

There are two big changes in game mechanics.

One there is conditional linking.  In Thunder Alley links can only occur when were one can push a car ahead using the draft or pursuit movement.  When using lead or solo movement if a car's path is blocked,  cost two movement points to push another car forward.  In Grand Prix even when using lead or solo movement a player can create a conditional link with a line of cars ahead of it and move then entire link at one movement point per zone.

The other is the use of non-player cars.  When a player activates one of these cars they can move at the higher speeds without any wear penalties.  So a player can activate a non-player car, give it a nine solo movement, maneuver it behind one of you cars and shove and any other car that gets in the way at that break neck speed.

Note follow-up.  After playing it several times I still think it is a good game but when it comes to replicating a F1 race it just does not feel right.

Played once five player.  This is not a bad game, but wasn't my thing.  Very nice board.  The cars look nice, but were badly designed from a component standpoint.  They have a light side and a grey side which is used to mark which cars have acted, and the consensus was that the difference in shade was frustratingly insufficient.

RATING: 5
One play with seven players. I am a big fan of Thunder Alley, and I was excited for this because I like open-wheel racing more than NASCAR, I like the shorter stated game length and the ability to play up to 11 players. I would still like to try it with that many.

The actual game length is I find much, much longer than the estimate on the box. I suppose I imagined in my head that if the game was shorter, that maybe the game was simpler. It's not, there are additional things to think about, and most do not add fun to the experience, they're just more rules and options to consider, and the extra AP makes the game run slower, not faster. Keep in mind I value and enjoy simplicity in games, and despite that I loved Thunder Alley even though it's moderately complex, because I felt the game could not be simplified further and still have that feel. But I despise complexity for complexity's sake, and that's the vibe I get from this. The whole is less than the sum of its parts.

Also some weird presentation choices. TA had the printed error and the start player marker was supposed to be two-tone but wasn't -- fairly minor stuff. GP doesn't have those problems, but instead they lightened the two tones to "White and very light grey" and for the whole game we were trying to see the cars and were asking each other what has already moved and what hasn't. This wasn't minor, this was a huge frustration over the course of the whole game, and is a bizarre decision to make with TA was fine this way.

I liked this so little, it's actually making me take a hard look at TA, and it's asking me be honest with myself whether I like that game as much as I thought I did. That's how disappointing the experience was for me.

Really enjoyed this follow up to Thunder Alley!  My son and I both feel this one adds even more strategy/decisions with the mandatory pit stop and the conditional linking, along with the tracks with the corners that go down to one lane.

ALL plays with a prototype. Rules have changed a bit I believe since...but we still enjoy playing by the rules of the version we have.

RATING: 6
Components: car tokens are not the best, but good quality overall
Complex: easy to teach and learn
Weight: light
Players: 5 or 6
Length: should not be more than 90 mins
Mechanics: play car, move car
Decisions: enough for these kind of games
Opinion: a racing game I liked, would not hit my tops but will play it once in a while.
You have your team of 2 cars, and probably could play with some neutral cars. With your hand cards you play one in your turn and move one of the cars (cars can only be moved by a card once per round). Within the movement, you can push or take with you all those behind.
And once all players have moved their cars, an event card happens.
It is a funny game, with the risk of being too long for what it is. The random factor is really high (cards in your hand and event cards), and you have also the movement of all the cars done by the rest of players, so you cannot plan ahead.
As already said, I will play it sometimes, but will no be a game I will propose.

I already owned Thunder Alley, so doing the P500 for this was a no brainer. The new system is amazing. Love the conditional linking dynamic. I have already P500'd the expansion tracks.

My only complaint is the gray gradient between the activated flipped side is too close to the normal side.

RATING: 2
This was way too fidgety, even for GMT. It has a really bad mechanic of flipping cars from dark side to light side (and vice versa) to indicate whether that car moved this turn. It's not only difficult to tell which side is which, but it's too easy to forget which way you have to flip them this turn. We played the short game of two laps, but about half-way through, I just wanted it to hurry up and end.

RATING: 6
After quite a few plays, my rating fell on Grand Prix by a good margin.  As a game about F1 (or any kind of road racing), I think it misses three key elements:

- There should be a feel that you are slowing down for the curves, and accelerating out of them.
- There should be a game element where you can 'push your luck' and go faster through a curve to make up ground.
- The race leaders should be clear, and position changes (esp. lead positions) should be dramatic events.

Both Formula D and Championship Formula Racing have these points, and better capture the feel of F1.  The curves in Grand Prix are just choke points that require no consideration about speed, while the position changes are way too frequent and too wild (last to first and back again over a few cards).

The mechanics in this game work very well as a stock-car themed game (i.e. Thunder Alley), but really just don't capture F1.

I think Grand Prix does do a good job with how pit stops and wear work and it is a decent game with a racing theme, and there aremany interesting aspects to how to play the game.  The ability to scale anywhere from 2 to 11 players is also handy in some conditions.

I think 4-5 players is really the sweet spot, as this is where you have dedicated NPCs for each team.  With more players, you get a ton of chaos and a more downtime.  2 or 3 players becomes very chess-like.

As far as the NPCs are concerned, they are an interesting game element.  However, since the goal of using the NPCs is to get them to do otherwise stupid things to help your team or hurt others, it isn't really thematic.

The event cards are interesting, but in practice the races are quite short (3 to 5 events); the bad luck of something taking out one of your cars isn't going to balance out.  In practice, the players that build up a ton of high wear and/or close calls are rarely the ones that get hit by a bad event, or if they are, it hits a back-marker that wasn't in the points anyway.

So, in the end, for the mechanics I would rather play Thunder Alley, esp. with the Crew Chief expansion.  For the theme, I would rather play Formula D or CFR.

I had ordered the expansion tracks, but eventually cancelled the order.  The game is just to abstract to need more than the four tracks it comes with.  It also bothered me over time to have fictional names for the tracks.  A big part of F1 is the history of these places.  The team names I can deal with; they change every year and I’m sure licensing them costs money.  It’s also easy to make new team cards, not so easy to modify the map and make it look good.

This is not a simulation of F1 racing.  If you are serious about F1 racing you probably don't want this game.  Your leader can go from 1st to well back in the pack in 1 turn.  Counter art, cards and tracks all look great hence the '2' rating, otherwise only a '1'.  But as a filler one-off game to have fun with friends/family this is ok.  Looking to trade for Race Formula 90.  Just doesn't get it for me anymore.

I bought an extra set of counters.

RATING: 6
Too early to be sure, but, sadly, it seems to play less well than Thunder Alley--"sadly" because I prefer the F1 theme. The NPC cars are part of the issue, but I think the bigger issue for me may be that the twists and turns in the track and the many narrowings and broadenings make it easier than in TA to segment chains of cars and leave more cars stranded, slowing things down. Right now, I'd probably play again just to help confirm or deny my initial impression, but I think I'd rather play TA for Formula De (the latter obviously being a very different game, but one that so far seems to scratch the F1 racing itch better).

With regard to the cars: The light/dark car sides are just insufficiently distinguishable, and this is a crucial mechanic, no pun intended. The problem's been acknowledged, and the problem is easily enough fixed with either a Sharpie or some dot stickers, but it's near crippling in some cases if unaddressed. Jeff's said that it was a computer-versus-paper issue, but I'm not sure that a person would've easily recognized the problem even if they'd gone through paper proofs *unless* individual cars were punched out and front and back compared. When you look at the unpunched countersheet, it actually looks like there's a highly visible difference because of the "massing" of the grayscreen on the "dark" sides of the unpunched cars, but once you punch out a single car and compare the front of one to the back of the other, the problem becomes immediately apparent. Like I said, it's understandable and home-fixable, but it's unfortunate that QC issues continue to dog this series. (In TA first printing, it was the failure to have both a light and a dark side to the 1st player marker.)

RATING: 8
Very fun F1 racing game. It captures the thrill and jostling for position of the race perfectly.  A great example of elegant abstraction of a real event into a game.
I LOVE trying to beat out other cars to squeeze into the tight curves in a chain and then "riding the wave" out and away!

RATING: 9
The game is very interesting with a base of more like a mind puzzle than a real racing. I do like the game so it's not a big problem (and I like mind puzzles). I have also played Formula D and that has more to do with racing and strategies. I do rate both games highly and I have no problem with playing either.

RATING: 9
For such a relatively small amount of changes they have managed to make this game feel way different to Thunder Alley . It speaks well of the design and testing of both TA and this that the system copes so well with such different motorsports. I prefer this one though, somehow the need for at least one pit stop for tyres and the neutral cars just adds to the decision making.

While my first play felt quite a bit like Thunder Alley thanks to the double yellow reset, I can see where this one will differ at least a little bit.  I like how damage is handled in this one and that aggressive driving also will be more likely the recipient of extra damage during the event phase.

I have never owned a car racing game.  Thunder Alley caught my interest, but I have never watched a Nascar race (and have no plans to).  But I watched some Formula One many years ago, and liked it.  So when ordering this I hoped it would be some fun with the kids.

It is.  Play is really straightforward mechanically and is a lot of fun - with some strategy mixed in too.

I can see this working well as a light alternative for my gaming group next time we are deep into a team multi-player game of a monster wargame:  to play on those nights when we just can't muster the mental energy for The Gamers.

On the surface it looks like Thunder Alley, but with some new markers, slightly different cards, and a new selection of tracks.  However, while the game play is similar, you need entirely different strategies and the NPC cars can frustrate the best laid plans.  While fine for a one off game in a few hours, this might best be enjoyed as a series of races.

This game is the remake of Thunder Alley, but is a simulation of the Formula 1 racing.  The event cards are less random of those in Thunder Alley, so you won't be resetting the race as nearly as much. There still is a lot of chaos and things beyond your control, especially with more players. 

Some people in the gaming group really like this. If it clocked in at 45 minutes, I think it would be palatable, but with 5 players, it took 3 hrs, which is long for doing the same thing over and over again.  If I take another game, like Camel Cup that has some similarities with the pack all moving, that game was fun. This game is just a bit too chaotic, which is not for my tastes, but again others really enjoy it. It's just not a game that really reels me in.

I had to change drastically my previous rating after playing with 8 players. The game works fine with 4-5 players and you have some feelings of a F1 race. With more players it is very cahotic and it is quite impossibile to plan a minimum of strategy. Moreover a lot of players can be out of the race too soon. You can have fun anyway, but it is no more a F1 racing imho. I am a Thunder Alley fun even if as european I prefer F1 racing.

Played Thunder Alley and thought it was okay but nothing special. As someone who remembers the movie "Grand Prix" and playing the great AH game Le Mans with my brother when we were kids, the theme here is more to my liking. I'll still wait and play someone else's copy before I consider buying it but I'd like to give it a try.

Update: Got the game and TA expansion tracks (they work as F1 tracks as well) for a good price, so no complaints here. I think whether you prefer TA over GP or vice verse depends largely on your race car preference. I did not grow up watching NASCAR but I did grow up watching F1 racing.

Really unsure of how to feel about this one. We only played it with 2 and I can CLEARLY see that it's better with more players. Managing almost 17 different cars with 12 cards in hand. Pass. Thunder Alley was a much better game for 2 players. Unless we were doing something drastically wrong, our first play took 2 1/2 hours and we called it as we still had 1 more hand of cards to go through.

Its rating will probably rise with another play and playing with at [i]least[/i] 4 players, but it didn't feel quite as fun as it's bigger brother.

This is a great game. You have to like single seater car racing to enjoy it though. If you're not into racing then don't bother with this game. I personally think that it plays well at all levels 2p through to 11 players but it can take an age. Best played at 2P, 5P, 6P and 11P in my opinion but you need race enthusiasts to play larger games. Only criticisms are that it can too long and the colour backgrounds when flipping over the cars could be a bit better as they are close in comparison. The darker grey should have been darker or black imo.

Picked up from the designers at Con on the Cob 2016.

A classic Amerigame: the tire rules seem an unnecessary complication, the event cards are arbitrary and uneven, and even the designers state that the game is largely out of your control. Why did I get this?

Good racing game but it doesn't feel like Formula 1 even if the cards have been adjusted a little bit toward higher speeds compared to Thunder Alley. The fact remains that the core mechanic of the game is from thunder alley and that core mechanic is more suitable for team management. Grand Prix has an improved pitting mechanic where different damage costs different time in the pits to fix and the bot cars were a nice addition as they gave some control beyond the own 2 cars. However, even this doesn't help because the major problem is that Thunder Alley is the superior game. There you need to make sure you focus on the whole team, in Grand Prix with the F1 scoring table you really only need one car to make it and having 2 cars within the top ten will likely only improve for example a 5th place to a 4th while you are still inevitably out of the race for first place.

RANK: 2870

RATING: 5
Great premise/theme and art, but really REALLY luck-based. Too much arbitrary/luck-based stuff without enough mechanics for the players to mitigate it. Disappointing, because as I said, the theme is nifty and the art is well done, and it was designed by a woman (need more of that in the industry!).

:thumbsup: There are a good deal of storylines that easily develop throughout a single play.
:thumbsup: Decisions and strategic choices are minimal, making this a short and thematic experience without much effort.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]Certain character and event cards encourage rather ruthless tactics against the opposing characters.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]Variability with the base game can feel a bit limited when playing multiple times in a short period of time.

:thumbsdown: The final dice rolls during the end game proposal stage typically determine the winner.
:thumbsdown: Some of the artwork is repetitive, which takes away from the theme and reduces some of the excitement.

RATING: 10
This is a really fun group game, even for people who aren't familiar with Pride & Prejudice. It becomes more fun when playing with a group of people who decide to embody their character and can be a bit cut-throat when it comes to collecting traits.

The amount of chance at the end is also great because you can win by being an Old Maid and you can lose by winning your top guy. Plus, there are no guarantees when it comes to a proposal.

A fun game that needs to be played with a group of friends.

The theme is amusing, and I guess you could call this an "experience" game, which is the only reason I'm not giving it a lower score. I would play this with friends that enjoy it for its theme.

RATING: 5
Marrying Mr Darcy scores all five points from me for faithfulness to the spirit of its source material.  It delivers a real sense of being a female character from Pride and Prejudice; of elopements, parties and small breaches of etiquette.  Its men range from cads and dullards to dashing.  The game itself is a random luckfest with few meaningful decisions.

I found the artwork quite pleasing and production quality is good.

Nice artwork and well integrated theme.  The gameplay is not the thing here as there are really very few decisions to be made.  This is a game that plays you.  The die rolling, particularly at the end, reduces everything to luck.  But, if you like the theme and have a group that is willing to "role-play" this a bit, then you have a very entertaining and attractive option here.

RATING: 5
June 2015 (rating after one 2-player game):
Got it to try it with my wife who is a Jane Austin fan (and not a gamer). The rules did not encourage her to play straight away as they seem quite dry and algorithmic compared to what my wife sees in the world of Pride and Prejudice.

After some weeks, we finally played it. Oh gosh, for me the theme was so pasted on and the game played itself almost entirely. Draw a card, read some Pride and Prejudice reference (which may as well be skipped), follow instructions (very similar every turn and not related to the reference text) on how many cards to play and draw from another deck. The only thing that saved the evening was our role playing - which of course does not come with the box. But there are so many more engaging games that could trigger a much deeper experience of acting and story telling. This one does not really stand out.

If you want to submerge yourself in the world of Jane Austin's characters, reach for the book and read it (maybe together) or do some pretending/role playing. If you want to play a game, find a mechanic that works for you independently of the theme.

RATING: 6.6
I am not the target audience for this game, but my gf bought it so I figured I'd read the rulebook. Simple, you are playing Event cards, gathering Character Points and then attracting Suitors (lest you become an Old Maid). There are a number of variants in the rulebook, and I would recommend playing it with the Undead Expansion if this just isn't your thing. Plays smoothly, easy to learn, perfect for a Tea Time or whatever?!?

This is a fairly simple card game but one that takes a unique theme and commits to it fully, making for an immersive and entertaining game that doesn't overstay its welcome. I bought this for my wife, who is a massive Austen fan, and she loved all the references and chances to quote the BBC miniseries, so it was a big hit. She won our first game as an old maid who went on to become a celebrated author, which seemed fitting. Not the deepest game out there but it does what it does really well and I'm glad to have it in the collection.

This game has to played with the right crowd: fans of Pride and Prejudice.  It's rather simple, draw a card, do what it says, move on.  But this game really shines with the flavor texts.  At it's heart it is a card collection game.  You attempt to collect the minimal amount of characteristic cards that your potential suitor admires in a woman.  At the end you roll the dice to see if he proposes to you.  Otherwise you might end up an Old Maid.

This delightful card game goes down like a warm cup of tea. Pleasant and satisfying, but it may not be substantial enough for hard-core gamers. That's because your luck in drawing cards is a strong indicator of our success in the game.

On your turn you just draw an event card and follow the instructions. In general you're attempting to add character points to your tableau, working to fulfill the minimum requirements of as many suitors as possible. Once the deck runs out, you enter the proposal stage and hope the die roll leads to scooping up the husband you most desire (i.e. is worth the most points).

Our friend who is an Austen scholar picked up this game and when she said she enjoyed it, that felt like the best stamp of approval. It's light, charming and fun - a good filler to play between heavier games.

This is a favorite at my weekly game group. We play it several times a month. The undead expansion is fantastic as well.

I would recommend this game to everyone. Even if you don't particularly like Pride and Prejudice.

I'd love to play it with my Jane Austen Society pals, but I don't see it getting off the shelf much otherwise, so I'm going to hang back and hope someone with a larger dowry will pick it up for us. I did have a fun time playing it, and I've played a lot worse games with less justification for their existence.

Cute little card game.  Definitely fun that it matches the book humor, plot points, and character traits to the card abilities and actions.  Random event cards aren't horribly punishing, so you could run into a situation with no good draws.  But play is short enough that it's not a big deal if one game goes poorly.  Pretty nice card quality.

I bought Marrying Mr. Darcy for my wife--a Jane Austen fanatic--and it was definitely a hit with her! The game is a little bit too random and light for a gamer, but it was still fun and good for a laugh, especially if you are even remotely familiar with Pride and Prejudice. There's the rub--if you don't really follow the Jane Austen crowd, the game probably doesn't have much to offer.

I had really good fun playing this one. On turn one Tom's heroine eloped with Wickham, who became known as sex-pest Wickham as he followed Tom wherever he went :)
The game itself is fairly simple mechanically and very easy to play but it is enhanced by all the nods to the novel, which I greatly enjoy. Twice I have aimed my heroine towards Mr Bingley only for him to head off to London at the last minute, with Jane even ending up an old maid  :(

RATING: 7
Marrying Mr. Darcy is a thoroughly charming little card game, themed on the female characters of Austen's Pride & Prejudice, and the importance of marrying well to ensure one's future happiness (and one's future well-being).

Like Liebe & Intrige, the game play involves enhancing the players' eligible young lady's attractions in the eyes of the possible gentleman suitors, but each player plays only one young lady out in society in Marrying Mr. Darcy.

Because of the theming from the novel, certain matches are more advantageous to particular young ladies, e.g., Lydia Bennett would do better not to attract Mr. Darcy, in preference for an attractive young soldier, such as Mr. Wickham or Mr. Denny.

Players acquire, play down, and/or lose Character cards in a series of events developed from the novel's plot.  Some events resolve simply, e.g., Draw 1 Character card, then Play 1 Character card, others carry lasting penalties, or provide later benefits, or involve a die roll with a range of possible outcomes.

Cunning Character cards can either be stored as points, or a Cunning card can be discarded and used to weaken another young lady's suit by discarding specific Character cards, e.g., character assassination.

After the series of events are concluded, the young lady with the highest saved cunning sees which young men she may attract, given her accumulated Character traits, and then rolls to see if she is lucky enough to attract a proposal from each of those men in turn. If one proposes, the young lady may choose not to accept him, in preference for another, but if no other suitors propose then she may be left an old maid.

I think the design does an admirable job of preserving the struggle for eligible matrimony, and at the same time providing game play, while not utterly abandoning the thematic setting of the story.

The cards are nice, the original artwork is appealing enough, and the play moves quickly through the deck, towards the matrimonial conclusion.  The strategy is not terribly deep, but it is involved enough to be a real game, with different possible outcomes.  The luck of the die roll certainly plays a part, but that seems fitting in love and marriage.

My wife and I are both fans of the book; given that preference, I liked this 1st design immensely, and I think my wife did as well.

If you're not a fan of Austen, or prefer your Austen with zombies, this game may seem a little tame (though there IS a Zombie expansion!), and if you're a luck-free strategist this is likely not for you.

But for me this is just involved enough to be fun, quick enough to play more than once, interactive enough to be a real game, small enough to be portable, and just makes a nice combination of elements overall. Perhaps it would be perfect over your afternoon tea (or coffee) with a friend or partner as well.

The gameplay itself is absolutely random and not that interesting. This is a game all about the theme, and on that level, it works. The flavor text is the star of the show, almost mocking the idea of falling in and out of favor with a suitor as being as unpredictable as a roll of the die.

It's not a game I'd want to play often, but it's good for a laugh from time to time.

As a fan of Pride and Prejudice, I love the theme of this game and the very amusing events. However I think this is a game that can only be played every now and then because it can feel a bit repetitive and the choices you can make aren't diverse enough.

I have mixed feelings about this game.  We played it and actually had some fun on that one play.  The fun was all due to the inside jokes on the cards, and the men having to "act lady-like."

Was the game thematic?  Yes, very thematic.  I enjoyed that part.  This was the game's main strength: the characters, the art, and ESPECIALLY all of the events on the cards made a lot of sense given the story of Pride and Prejudice.  However, sometimes even the game's strength was weak: I don't like that a lot of the cards were basically inside jokes, and if you aren't intimately familiar with all the details of the story, you won't catch several of the references.

It was also neat that the game told a story.  With many subplots.  In our game, Mr. Whickam eloped with one of the women, and then another character was put into utter disgrace because her sister was the woman eloped with.  So things like that were very fun to play the first time around.  However, I have to realize that with subsequent plays, many of these unique things would be very tiresome as they're just the same events every game.  So, from the story perspective, this game was fun to play one time, but would hardly be fun a second, and dreadfully boring a third.

I also didn't like that many of the cards that were plot points, and gave you +1 card/+1 play, also said "if you are _____, +2 cards/+2 plays instead."  It rewards you for having the character who did that thing in the actual story.  There is no point to this.  Since you have no control over what event card you draw, it is merely rewarding randomness.  It furthermore tells the players, "there's a right story; it's called Pride and Prejudice, and for every way that your story is not exactly like it, you are penalized."  Is this game supposed to be "write your own story" or not?  Either answer is flawed with this implementation.

But now for the worst part: strategy.  There is hardly ANY strategy to this game at all.  It kind of pretends to have strategy (different suitors will benefit you more if you get hitched with them; also, all character cards get you points at the end of the game).  However, what you do every turn is simply draw an event card and do what it says.  Some people have all the luck and some have none.  

The winner is flat-out decided by luck, no doubt about it.  Your only strategic decisions are in which character cards you play and which you discard.  So you can make some decisions that can help you a little if made correctly.  But this decisions are simplistic enough that you can master the game quickly.  And they only made a little difference to begin with; 90% of the game is just luck.

And for being as long as it was (about 2 hrs), that amount of luck is atrocious.  The amount of luck compared to hours you have to invest in this game is terrible.

Oh and now for the OTHER worst part.  The rulebook was absolutely atrocious.  It didn't do the most basic function of a rulebook: explain clearly the RULES, what you DO.  Two fundamental things were never stated in the rules and I had to infer them from the event cards, even after reading the rules 3 times.  1) you play character cards face up in front of you, and cleverness cards face down in front of you.  To do so, you need an event card that tells you to play a character card. 2) Each of the types of character cards should have its own stack, so that there is always a "top" card.

Also the character abilities were blatantly unbalanced.

First play: a 6.  Second play onward: a 3.

In this game you are one of the female characters from Pride and Prejudice and you are trying to marry one of the male characters.  You gain various attributes that those male characters are looking for in a spouse and try to qualify for this.  You select events throughout the game and resolve those events.  When the deck is exhausted, you move to the proposal phase where a character can propose to you.  This is done with a dice roll.  If it fails, you become an old maid but still can get points from this as well by a dice roll.  

You sum your attributes with proposal points, most points wins.

I like the game a lot because I like Jane Austen but the game is very swingy and there is a lot of luck involved. In terms of just game play, I might give this game a 5, but as the theme makes it a 7 for me.   It is a good game for young kids due to the high luck factor.  If you daughters watch one of the Jane Austen movies with their Mom, this is a great way to get them into games.

RATING: 7
If the minor inconsistencies to its tight dependence on faithfully following the plot of Pride and Predudice can be ignored (for example, I played a character without sisters who had three sisters elope), then this is a fun game. I did find, though, that without playing in character, it felt a little stale. This is more fun as an excuse to test your acting skills. I'm looking forward to adding the zombies expansion.

I LOVE Pride and Prejudice, so I am a fan of this game. I really like the art, and I actually like the luck-based style of the game, I think it keeps it interesting and easy to play for friends/family who like P&P but aren't deep into board games (yet). :) Looking forward to picking up the expansions!

I found this a very entertaining game, especially playing with a couple Austen afficianados.  You have a little, a very little, control, but the real fun is acting out the events that are occuring, and you really end up with little mini-stories that are quite amusing.  The artwork is very good, as well.  Will not be played often, but i look forward to the next round.

Pros:  Great theme, light game weight, the wives loved the card text.  Length of game doesn't outstay its welcome.

Cons:  Like Munchkin was for me, after 4-5 games the humor and funny card text will wear off.  There are very little decisions to be had and the end game is basically a 50/50 dice roll.

If you take the game for what it is, it accomplshes what its designed to do.  Jane Austen fans will enjoy this.  Don't come into this expecting extremly deep gameplay and just have a good time and some roleplay.

RATING: 6
It's not much of a game, really- turn a card over, read it, eventually roll a die- but if you and your significant other have fond memories of the book then this is a funny way to relive those memories. The art and graphic design is lovely too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simply put, for Pride and Prejudice fans, this game is a blast, but for "gamers" who aren't, you'll probably hate it.  Non-gamers in general might enjoy it, as the theme and role-playing aspect can be quite humorous.  Overall, more of an "activity" than a real game, as it is mostly luck-based (with the real decisions coming in how to mitigate or push the luck).  

For me, it does a brilliant job of giving a feel for what little control a woman of that time period/culture had over her fortune and lot in marriage/life, and this is what the designer has said was the goal, so I think it was a great success.

Again, I love it, even as a guy, but only when I don't mind playing something more for the social aspect.  Do NOT play expecting it to scratch any strategic itches, or if "losing" because of bad card draws will be a problem for you.

This was clearly made by a lover of the novel, but definitely not a game designer.
You build up for nearly half an hour to have everything ruined by a single bad die throw. The mechanisms are too random to apply any tactics, let alone strategy.

I found this game fairly 'meh'.  It works, but there wasn't a lot of choice to make; it's very much luck dependent on the rolls you make, as well as the cards you draw.  If everyone role-played the characters, it may well make it more fun I guess.  I just don't have a group with which I could suggest doing that.

[b]Marrying Mr. Darcy[/b] was traded away in a math trade 11/10/14. (Received Biblios)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]I don't have much else to say about this "game". We played it again and there really aren't any choices to be made. You flip a card and do what it says. Yes you can play a card from your hand, but there really isn't much choice to it. Do you have a certain personality trait, if so you play it and that's it. Who you end up marrying comes down to the roll of a die.

My wife is a huge Jane Austin fan and she thought the theme was good, but agreed after a few plays that there wasn't anything left to explore.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (5):[/COLOR]

[i]I bought this game because my wife is a huge fan of the show. I am not sure what to say about this one, it is not bad but it also isn't much of a game. You basically play cards and read the text which definitely brings out the theme of the game. However; the game is very straightforward you literally play a card, do what it says and then usually draw another card. The end of the game (the marriage proposal) comes down to a die roll.

Enough said, if you or someone close o you is a fan of the show it may be worth picking up for a few plays.[/i]

An experience 'game' in that you don't really have much decision making to do. Narrative is provided by an event deck in which there are teas, dances and kissing the militia resolved by die rolls. You hope to get events which allow you to draw and/or play cards from your hand which have coloured attributes and values, aim being to amass enough pts in colours matching a highly valued suitor. Once the event deck runs out the most 'cunning' (or rather lucky) player gets to roll for eligible suitors or lose out and become an old maid. Ok if you want to just chat and have fun with the theme and situations rather than work out profitable gains and avenues.

Great game that accomplishes what it is supposed to. It is lighthearted, although you certainly make decisions during the game, they are usually not brain burners.

RATING: 5
Simple, inoffensive, set-collection game with character. The theme is, surprisingly, prominent, both in the design and the flavor text on the cards. If nothing, it helps you get into Georgian-era spirit, whether that takes the form of getting seriously in character, or parodying the entire premise of it all. Thankfully, it does not drag. The decisions just aren't all too interesting, and the randomness too abundant, and that brings it down.

This is definitely better is a larger group. The two player is okay, but it was much more fun at 6.  I think if you do play 2, you need to PICK your heroines based on competition and maybe even do some card weeding versus just randomly splitting the deck. (JW)

Plays quickly, has some strategic options during play and captures the feel of the novel surprisingly well.  Enjoyable family game, particularly if familiar with the book or films.  
It's important to focus on improving attributes important to your "target" suitors.  Tactical play of Cunning cards can be key in eliminating rivals.  I was initially wary of the die rolling at the end (to see if a suitor proposes) but it feels right. Several things mitigate the randomness: the better you do the more suitors you roll for, you may get a proposal before the endgame, several cards allow you to re-roll, add/subtract to your rolls, etc.  
I think there's enough strategy involved that better players will usually win.

Looks quite cool. I have to admit this...I really like this story. I ended up watching the A&E version several times due to my wife being a huge fan.

Update: Played one 2 player game so far.  My impressions...it's kind of random. I'm not saying it's devoid of strategy. Far from it.  But it honestly feels more like an 'experience game', where you're kind of along for the ride. (Though it's a fun ride)

I do think the randomness at the end of the game is highly warranted, to give that feeling of apprehension that's necessary to match the story.

I think it's the randomness in the middle of the game which seems to not be quite as necessary.  I don't think it detracts from the game much, but if you're the sort that doesn't like dice in a game...well...

I'll also add that I think the game's sweet spot is probably with 4 or more players, to create more competition.  When we played, the two heroines we played with had very different preferences, which lowered the tension level.  I'll try it again with more players to see what I think after that.

All in all, a very enjoyable game, and one that models the story remarkably well. The theme is very, very strong.

Update 2: Played again with three people.  Definitely felt better with more players. I'm thinking the sweet spot is 4-5 players.  But I'll know better after more plays.

This is a game in search of a book club. I can see this being a big hit in some catalog aimed at book lovers. As a gamer's game, it is just too random, with random cards compounded with random die rolls, making it largely luck-based. Given it's length that's not horrible... but it ends up being a game you play for the theme and experience rather than for the gameplay. I am a big Austen fan and I love Pride & Prejudice, so the game appealed to me from that aspect... but that only justifies a single play. There just isn't enough game here for me to want to recreate the experience.

Dull. I felt like I had very little control over the outcome of the game. I purchased this for my wife because I thought she would enjoy the theme. I played it with my 12-year-old daughter who said she enjoyed it. I don't intend to ever play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game is mostly a matter of drawing event cards to obtain the personal characteristics (Beauty, Wit, Friendliness & Reputation) necessary to attract the suitors who will provide you with the most points at game end and then hoping you get lucky at the random proposal roll during the final stage. There is some limited 'take that' using Cunning cards and some of the events can be rather nasty. Highly luck-driven and not for everyone, particularly those too insecure to affect a falsetto British accent while playing - it's best enjoyed as a 'divertissement' (like Love Letter) for the sheer whimsy of it and is not to be taken seriously.

It's a game of ladies building character to interest the best suitor. Mechanically it's very simple, which may turn some off, but the Austen fans may enjoy the game as it's full of characters and events they'll recognize.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
  I think that it's an interesting game, inviting you to build up your heroine in terms of beauty, whit, cunning, etc.  Quite a few of the event cards have you roll the die to determine your outcome.  The end of the game can be quite frustrating, as your hopes can be dashed with a bad roll or two.  Of course, for some that is also how courtship in real life can go. Chance and luck can play a big part in this game.

  I've only tried two player games, and I think it'd be more fun with a larger group. 

  Overall, I think it's an interesting game, certainly a theme that you don't see a lot.  It's probably not going to be a mainstay on the table of your hardcore gaming group.  That being said, My wife is really looking forward to the next holiday she can get together with her sisters and play this game.  I imagine it will be easier to get them to play this than something like dominion.

  If you are a Jane Austen fan, or know a few of them, I'd highly recommend the game.  If not, it may not be the game for you.

I guess if you're a fan... a super fan... of Austen. But there's barely a game here. Every other card game is better.

Marrying Mr. Darcy is a social game with a social theme.  Players take on the role of an eligible woman in the era of landed gentry from the novel Pride and Prejudice.  Players go through courtship striving to polish their characters and thus improve their chances at selecting their suitors and eventual husbands.  The designer has pointed out that in the era, as in the game, women lacked much control in how their lives unfolded.  This lack of control is central to its theme and its card & die mechanics.  The great character portraits and the period art on the personality and event cards contribute to the atmosphere.  The game is self-described on page one of the rules as a role-playing game, so atmosphere is no small part of the game.  Can be played with gamers and non-gamers, Jane Austen fans and non-fans.  Play with those who can laugh at their fate, win or lose, and are willing to bask in the atmosphere.  Great fun.

P.S. - One guy who had read Pride & Prejudice more than a dozen times kept commenting how the event cards mirrored the book's characters nicely.  I haven't read it many years, but am reading it again now.

Super fun card game.
Helps if you're familiar with the work of Ms Austen, but not essential.

Best served with tea and gossip.

Solid and fun theme that makes this a great game for Pride and Prejudice fans. But the game play is pretty simple and there's not much strategy to be had, so it might be a little boring for those that are used to more involved play. Decent pick for non-gamers.

Traded 10/17

Nice fun, great story orientation while having a lot of luck which doesn't really detract from the game

Pride & Prejudice Fluxx. Whoop-dee-doo. This is among the same lines as games like Munchkin and Exploding Kittens where you just get a hand of cards and simply have to deal with them. Draw a card and see what happens. -1 on your marriage proposal rolls? Too bad for you! Look, I just got a card that allowed me to play 2 cards! Isn't that GREAT??? And I don't care that it's 'all about the theme', if the gameplay is bad, it's a bad game, and no theme whatsoever can save it. Dumb.

Great if you like story games that play you as much as you play them. Light strategy, but there definitely is some, and quick play. Even more fun with the zombie expansion :)

Would not recommend to anyone besides Pride and Prejudice fans. Roleplaying as your lady character highly encouraged.

Simple and easy little game. There's not really much to think about, you just do what the cards say. But we actually played it with a big Pride and Prejudice fan and so we had some fun, she liked it very much.

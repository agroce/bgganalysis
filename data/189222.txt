The game's release, the field of play, the characters and equipments are well return the apocalyptic atmosphere that resembles the Mad Max. The game time is long enough, but the atmosphere makes up for it.

The game is amazing. I love the "Mad Max" background and the whole story that is written in the Rulebook and Survival Guide. The art is wonderful with a mature-comic style. The gameplay is solid and entertaining. I actually tried a couple of co-op and a couple of solo and always amaze me. I suggest the game to everyone who likes co-op and competitive game.

the sologame is much faster (1/2h) than the "classic" mode with 5 players (2-3h). Both are much enjoyable. With many players you have more tactical options as a group. Have to try the cooperative and the competetive modes.
The Artwork and the quality of the components are great.

Mad Max the board game? It could be for some and I could understand why this would tickle someone's fancy, but it was just a dreadful experience for me where luck and randomness dictates what's happening on the board. It seems that you want to cooperate with your fellow opponents since at the difficulty level that I played the game ends too soon for you to complete your objectives alone. Mediocre at best.

Overall, a very average take on the post-apocalypse. It does have absolutely amazing illustrations and a couple of very clever mechanisms. The wind direction/landsailing, as well as multi-use cards and actions based on crew are all solid. What it's lacking is excitement and drama.

The strongest point of the game is the visual appearance. The gameplay is mediocre. Quite easy to play and a bit longer than should be. There are a few key moves otherwise it is pretty easy to find out what to do. I've enjoyed it but I'm not sure I'd play it again soon.

RATING: 8
It is a fun game, it has some very interesting mechanic. The set up takes a while, but it can be done quicker once you played some. The rules are clear, and the rulebook is very nice. I like the dice-less mechanic of battles. The grapchic is very nice and contributes a great deal to the atmosphere of the game. I like how it scales to multiple player numbers

I have played the game twice and fully intend to play it more. After you understand the rules it is actually very simple to play and the game flows smoothly. I feel like the game is pretty balanced. Some people have mentioned that sail vehicles become obsolete once you get a gas vehicle but there are several reasons to keep a sail vehicle. They travel much farther and give you access to more resources. I like the different difficulty and game modes. You can play competitive, cooperative, or classic among others. I think the expansion will only make it better.

If you like post-apo theme, it might suit you. Otherwise it's a move and pick-up straightwforward game with some twists, but nothing special.

RATING: 6
Pros:
- Thematic mechanics (wind sailing, fatalities are easy, focus on vehicles and managing resources).
- Movement mechanic for sailing vehicles was interesting.
- No text other than the rulebook and names.
- Colorblind friendly.

Cons:
- Rulebook layout favors the reference format, and does not give clear instructions on how to play. The reference is incomplete and requires some induction to fully play the game (i.e. when activating multiple enemy types it is unclear is there's a procedure or up to player discretion). Some rules would've been better to place in various places.
- Most game mechanics uninteresting, decision tree is uninteresting.
- Raiders are really bland and really act more like resource nodes.

I dig Saltlands. The rules are fairly simple. It offers a nice puzzle element to choosing your path, the way you equip your survivor, and the order in which you activate the raiders. The options to play cooperatively, semi-cooperatively, and competitively are interesting, but I'm not convinced that the game works equally well across all modes. However, I've played only a few times and the semi-cooperative game ended up devolving into a cooperative game. This is going to depend largely on your group though. I think the art is amazing, and the graphic design is nice but does leave some ambiguities about how certain things work.

The theme really shines through, and gameplay reminds me of Mage Knight BG, but a lot lighter (which is a good thing).

Seems half-baked.  The win condition is crummy, there's not really great decisions to be made, the raiders are not scary and are hard to distinguish, and the cars seem strictly better than the land sail.  I like the illustrations though.

Decided at the 11th hour not to back the Kickstarter. The theme seems awesome and the mechanics look neat, but if the difficulty level is swingy and if it takes too long to play and set up then we're just not going to get enough plays out of it. 
That said, I still really want to play a game or two of this!

There's a lot to dislike here:
-Enemies spawn and attack randomly, often killing players in situations that are either unpredictable or unavoidable. 
-The game's iconographic language is often difficult to read and confusing.  Even after 3 hours and dozens of rule book consultations, there are symbols that none of us understand.
-The game's win condition isn't very exciting to pursue, and may end up actually being impossible to achieve based on how some game tokens randomly move.
-The only interesting and original mechanic in the game -- sand sailing against shifting winds -- becomes immediately obsolete once players pick up their first car 3 minutes in.

Ultimately, I did not enjoy my time spent with this game in the least.

It is good that the art and graphic design are so immersive, because the rules are barely thick enough to support a narrative. Will have to see how it holds up to co-op and competitive play. Looks rather unforgiving.

Attractive game that really nails the setting of the better Mad Max movies. The wind mechanic is novel and creates an interesting challenge for movement. Moving the bad guys slows the game down a bit, which weakens the theme of the game a little. I wish the combat was more dynamic.

Very long setup time, rules are confusing at first. The wind mechanic becomes obsolete once you pick up another vehicle which can happen very early. Only played this game solo so far, but I feel that trying to explain the game to a group of new people would be a hassle.

This game is not without its problems, but is still a terrific bit of chaos. It's quite a bit of fun and the theme shines through brilliantly. Each of the characters feel very different and all of the vehicles have a great give and take of good and bad attributes. The weather and wind direction changes are a nice touch as well. If you like the theme, you should probably give this one a shot.

Played this solo and absolutely loved it. It hurt that I thought I was doing so well and still lost by about a turn or two. But it's been plaguing my brain, which just means I really want to play it again. I think I know what I did wrong in solo, so I have a new strategy going in next time. But I'm also psyched to play this in classic mode with my normal crew.

RATING: 4
Great potential but on first play through found many issues.

3 players doing co-op mode hard level
Rating will be changes as we play a few more times.

Issues:
- Rules are not clear and we wrote down more than 30 questions on this first time.
- Too easy to win.  
- Raiders cannot swarm cause each attack separate.  
- Sandstorm effect can laugh off cause just stay on same terrain tile and lose nothing.  If you move into another terrain you can choose what to lose and there's always something in hand can lose easily with the large hand sizes.
- Raiders cannot do enough damage to make a challenge until you get to 5th or 6th cards.  Especially anyone with ploughman who has natural 1 armoer.   And by then your hand is so full of defense and attack cards you just wipe them out easily.  
- Too easy to explore new terrain making these actions and having binoculars no real benefit.
- Vehicles always have gas so just keep moving.  Not themeatic with running out of gas and having to look for more.  So everyone ditches the wind sails early on for gas vehicles.
- Repair cards never got used.  Why bother.  Most cards the same and so many in hand already.  why would anyone toss 5 to draw 5 more?
- setup takes awhile and have to separate card sets with same back
- No real reason to have 2nd companion because you're never beside more than 2 tiles and no raider needs more than 2 attacks to defeat.  If you need a third just play one of the many plentiful water cards to refresh and attack again.  So just keep the 5 cards you get to have because of an open space on your character card. 

Good:
- movement with the land sails is really cool.  Which makes the point of getting gas vehicle early take away one of the games best features.
- raider miniatures are nice and the theme is exciting.

Fixes:
- Don't show terrain tiles until character with binoculars gets next to them.  When flipped don't reveal the tokens until next to them or use the binoculars to examine one tile each exhausted character.  Toss the explore cards.  Don't reveal the terrain if rumor card puts the victory icon there.  Stays flipped and unrevealed.
- Use vehicle once then consider gas as used abandon and go back to land sail or use gas card to refill.
- Allow raiders to stack attacks so swarm becomes an issue.  Activate more raiders at one time and give them ability to do more damage earlier.  Maybe only use card numbers 4-5.
- Many times could not spawn raider because other vehicles spawned on the location already.  
- Reduce hand size significantly.
- Need a video play through online with the production copy to help new players and clarify the rules.


Conclusion:

Great potential damaged by poor rules book and the easy victory.  We were getting so bored we almost decided to double activate the raiders to try and create some sense of danger and threat.

Maybe the expansion would help.

This is a very good game with:

-strategic combat system
-and an athmospere where everybody want to try themself

There are lot of rules, but a very useful and well-written rulebook.

I would like play that game every windy week.

1 play only. The theme is cool and some mechanics, such as weather and movement, are clever and interesting. But the rules are a little cumbersome, the mechanics feel somewhat overwrought, and the gameplay didn't feel smooth. Some actions, such as trade and lure, were never used but that may have been specific to the 1 game I played. I think some of these issues would improve with repeat plays, and a better grasp of the game and strategies, though.

Whilst I wouldn't say that this was a great game, it is fun, colourful, well-themed and there's a lot to like.  There's some very strong need for some decent hand-management and thinking if you're going to stand a chance of winning.  There is luck in which cards come out of your hand when, but that also adds a element of edginess to the game which I like.  I think it's going to be pretty replayable with the modular boards.  I'm sure an expansion to this (ala Mississippi Queen's Blck Rose) would be very welcome in the future.

+ Very intuitive and fast play, even with 4 or 5 players; The game strikes an outstanding strategic balance as you try to manage your dogs, brake, and the course itself.

RATING: 6
A light-hearted racing game.  Theme is pretty thin, but the mechanics work well so it doesn't matter.  (It [i]is[/i] a racing game after all.)  Plays quickly and is very easy to explain/learn.

One big complaint:  Gameplay is degenerative.  That is, dents tend to lead to more dents.  Dents decrease your playable cards in hand, which decrease your choices, which lead to an increase in suboptimal choices, which lead to more dents.  Once you hit 3 dents or so, you're effectively a dead sled riding, just waiting for your explosive finale.

One small complaint:  Can be very luck dependent/random.  The card draw is paramount.  Draw a selection of cards and you have a good number of choices.  Draw similar cards and your choices diminish or become nonexistent.  This is intrinsic to the mechanics so learn to live with it.

One big virtue:  The game is short.  If you're knocked out or fairing poorly, your boredom or misery is sure to be short-lived.

Overall, a short, mostly-fun race game.  Doesn't grab me, though few race games do.  I encourage you to try it out.  It's a short, simple, good game, just not for me.

Snow Tails takes the concept of a hand of movement cards from Ave Caesar and makes it a little more complex; you now have two cards regulating speed and direction and a third operating the brakes.  Hence, the card play is quite a bit more interesting than in Ave.

The modular track is a good idea, providing plenty of variability in shape, length and difficulty of the course.  Damage is also well handled, with cards taken into hand to clutter it up and reduce your options.  The mechanics and the artwork are all nicely thematic. If there's a criticism to be made, there are perhaps fewer opportunities to block opponents than in other race games, due to a generally quite wide track.  

Despite so many things being done right, I can't say I've really had a lot of fun with this game.
Perhaps that's just how it is for me with most race games.

A worthy card-driven racing game that is a good family game.  It isn't particularly compelling beyond the basic race parameters that you manipulate with your card choices - movement and drift - in coordination with the racetrack limitation and and speed limits.  Might be one of the better race games out there, but in truth, I am just not a huge race game fan.

RATING: 7
Somewhat mathy the left-right drift mechanisms aren't wholly intuitive which is part of what makes it interesting.  Which is to say what makes it interesting is figuring out how the math of the cards affects your sled, rather than having fun in the racing.  Tracks are fun as a building exercise.  Individualized player components feel good.  Bad decisions early will punish new players.  Recommend a short teaching game for new players.

The card-driven movement and drifting rules equations in Snow Tails must have the single coolest mechanic in any racing game I own. Granted, I don't own a lot, but I like how this is so simple and yet strategic once you're pushing out there on the tracks. The trickiness of the dog sledding seems like it's completely captured here, and assembling the track in different configurations assures strong replay value. Bits and art in this new edition are great. Wonderful game.

Fantastic racing game.  Probably the only racing game you could 1-play, and still enjoy.

Having some trouble getting this to the table...  it's not terribly difficult, but it's not a game that wins over crowds of non-gamers, nor is it a game that the gamers particularly shout for, either.  Still a good game, just not hitting the table all that often.

-------------------------------------------

A short review of my triumphs and tribulations of this game.

The good:  The card mechanic is just plain fun.  Every turn, even if you're in last place, trying to figure out how to make your sled go, is a hoot.  Never gets old.  

The bad:  This is a racing game.  I'm awesome with racing games, I think they're a good genre.  

However, where this falls flat is that you can't really predict where you're going to go, and you can't really predict where your opponents are going to go as well as some other racing games.  This takes out one of the most fun parts of any racing game, and that's 'screwage'.

The other thing is, people generally try to race themselves vs. the track, and hope their luck works-out in their favor as it comes to placing first second or third.  This is good, but not a press-your-luck situation that I like to see---where people press their luck against eachother, and hope the track works out for them.  Most players will do anything possible to avoid a damage card, even if it means losing the race.  

So I like it, it still stays an '8' because I love to play it, but I think there are other, better racing games out there.

---------------

Traded:

If I had a steady group of folks that would play this, I think it would easily hit an 8.5.  It really does reward repeated plays more than most games I can think of---even the thick economic games (I'm looking at you, Masters of Venice).  I would really recommend doing a short-course game, and then doing a long course game with any group.  The short course means any mistakes made basically get erased, and the next game should be highly contentious.  

So, a steady group being friends that come over every weekend, or a homogeneous group of kids.

Otherwise, I hate to be a jerk here, but there's always someone new to the game that's like, "wait, umm, uhhh....  uhhh...  wait..." and it takes them about 5 minutes to make a turn when they finally accept that yes, they're going to take a damage card.  The big 'paws' token exists for a reason.

A really well-designed race game.  The ways that you are forced to manuever your sled in order to avoid obstacles works really well.  It is just cool to see how you are forced to slow down when hitting a turn even though you desperately want to accelerate.  They have a damage card system that feels like it will be dire, and yet everyone ends up taking damage, so it's all about knowing when you can afford to lose a card.  Just a really fun game that takes less time than I ever expected.  I'll be keeping my eye out for a copy of this one!

I'm rather torn by the game.

It feels like a game that should be more fun for what it is.  It has some fun elements, but the game isn't as fun as other games with a similar time commitment (i.e. Galaxy Trucker).

It feels like the game was supposed to be a serious one, with good play winning consistently, but is too random for that.  It's almost like they decided that if they made the game "more fun" that the game would not be one which could be taken seriously, and yet at the same time, if it were "less random," it wouldn't be as fun.  They seemed to have constrained themselves on both sides of the fence.

I like the drifting/brake mechanic, and the way you may play only cards of the same type.  I do not enjoy the luck of the draw, nor the deck-management (since the deck gets reshuffled over the course of the game) aspect.  These are both areas that could use some improvement.

I would find it interesting to see a less random game which is not solvable, instead allowing the 4th place to lay down track 3 tiles ahead of the first place as the game progresses, while still needing to manage your deck resources.

I'm sure I'll play this one again in the future, but I'm not sure how I'll feel about it upon further play.  Could feasibly go either way, with the addition of snow-flows/trees (which we did not play with, for everyone's first game).

A friend of mine called Snow Tails a Euro-Racer. It has very creative mechanics and it plays in less then an hour. Be warned that there is a lot of simple math involved. Sadly, I can't get it to the table very often with my group. We enjoy heavy games but we just prefer racing games to be lighter.  Fast Flowing Forest Fellers was a big hit in my group.

OK, so I am not a big fan of race games but this is better than most. Definitely very thinky - lots of tough decisions and repays a great deal of forward planning and risk management.

I find racing games boring as they just play like a more sophisticated version of the Game of Goose: Snow Tails is no exception, although it feels a little bit more thematic than they usually are. [i](December 2012)[/i]

I enjoy Snow Tails and it's a gorgeous game, but my rating has decreased slightly as of late. Luck of the draw can really screw over a player to the point of ruining their experience with the game. Sure, a risky or bad play probably put them in that conundrum, but newer players won't realize their folly until it's too late. Then they spend the rest of the game hopelessly in last place with a hand full of dents. It reminds me of other unforgiving racing games like Powerboats. Both games are great, unless you're the dude crashed out in the middle of nowhere with no chance of getting back in the race.

A rather tricky race game.  Even the soft turns are challenging to navigate.  As with most racing simulations, the player turns take a long time so it feels more like a crawl than a race.  It's pretty easy to wipe out even without the (advanced game) tree obstacles.  The "even-pulling" bonus is huge for players near the back, and it can give underdogs a good chance to catch the leader.

Nice looking racing game with a simple mechanic to (1) move you across lanes with the difference in strength between 2 dogs and (2) to move you forward with the sum of the strength of the dogs, less the rating of your brakes.

One play. Interesting enough - the mechanism for adjusting your sled's speed and turning is clever - but I could see plenty of downtime even with four players and it's easy to wreck your chances with just one bad move (which I did, and had to 'go through the motions' for the remaining 15 or so mins).

I figured that this would be a big hit with my game group and it was. Parts of this game remind me of Mississippi Queen, Formula D, and Roborally; all group favorites. 

I plan on trying to design a Roman chariot racing version for Quincon. For that, I would add 'pit stops' and more direct player conflict. 

For someone that likes Mississippi Queen but is put off by the steep price tag, I would heartily recommend Snow Tails.

Rating based on one play with four players.  This game reminds me of a cross between Ave Caesar, RoboRally and Mississippi Queen, although I'm told you can throw a little Formula De in too (I've never played that one).

I think that the card mechanism and all of the parts really work well with the theme.  The drifting, check point speed limits, and dents really make for some great risk management and tough decisions.  At this point, I'm willing to crown this my favorite racing game (although, admittedly I've only played a few).  The customizable tracks allow for a lot of replay value.

I got this one on a lark, as a way of breaking the $100 barrier when I pre-ordered TotAN and Space Alert from Boulder Games earlier in the year.  Our experience with racing games had amounted to no more than Bolide, which... sucked.  In that game, once you got the movement mechanism down (novel though it was, that happened after the first two games), it was drier than the Sahara.  Absolutely no fun (at least with two).  I was suckered into Snow Tails not so much by the theme, but by the mechanic and the beautiful work Asmodee always does on production design.  Plus, the price was right.  How is it?  Very good - not great, perhaps we'll tire of it after a while, but for now it really fills the gap of shorter filler that can still be contentious.  We both love the movement mechanism - smart, novel, and very thematic.  The dent cards are also a nice elegant solution, and very damaging - you really miss those extra cards once they leave your hand!  The tracks are beautiful, and if you play with all the bells and whistles (lots of turns, and all the obstacles) the game can be very intense and fun.  Plus, runaway leader seems to be the exception rather than the rule here - almost all our games have been down to the wire.  And did I mention how beautiful this game is?  I love Asmodee - a truly underrated publisher.

Fun race game with a unique movement mechanism - you need to slide your sled around corners and that and the speed limits on the entry to corners are what make it difficult.  For those who want a more extreme experience the modular track has sections that take the difficulty way up (including 'watch out for the trees' and the narrow ravine, which is a killer).  

Having playtested early versions, it's interesting to see the final tweaks that have been applied and a pleasure to admire the gorgeous artwork of the published edition.  It was also a pleasure to finally play a game of Snow Tails with Fraser and Gordon - even though I finished well behind in second place it was an achievement to survive the killer course and beat even one of the designers.

2 months later and I finally got this game to the table.  This was so much fun (especially since everything moved so smoothly and quickly with everyone playing quickly).  It seemed like the game came down to who could go into the corners in the lead.  Can't wait to get repeat plays and play more maps.

Played super fast.  I would be fine playing a couple of courses in one night.  Everyone got into the game super fast and we didn't have a lot of questions about gameplay.  I like simple gameplay that lends itself to a good deep enough game.

This is quite a satisfying racing game. Very reminiscent of Formula De, but with a few big distinctions:

-The dice have been replaced with cards so it's more about hand management than pressing your luck. Whichever mechanic you like better will probably determine which game you prefer - personally, I see the cards as an improvement.

-You can't choose to move from side to side; you have to use your cards to control your "drifts." Great vehicle (HAH) for meaningful decisions!

-Lacks Formula De's damage control system. Players are heavily penalized for even getting damaged once, which I enjoy. Makes the game more tense and forces you to be very careful with your plays.

-Modular board makes for more interesting and varied tracks (without shelling out extra cash for expansion boards!)

Only played with two so far, so I'm curious to see how well it holds up with more players and more plays!

Similiar to Formula De, but instead of rolling a bunch of dice you are drawing cards from your deck.  The game, after one play, seems to come down to hand management and not getting stuck sliding into the walls by putting your faster dogs on the inside, if your deck allows it.  The Damage is a neat mechanic and really hurts your play - but the game overall didn't seem meaty enough for me.

RATING: 7
Between Formula D, Mississippi Queen, and Snow Tails, it's hard for me to pick a favorite. Each one offers its own perk. With Snow Tails, the drifting aspect is unique and clever. And, though I've only played one game, it looks like there's many track options (from the same box!), and the components are very nice.

It's a bit "mathy" though, and of the three, I think Snow Tails requires the most planning. I can see why they included the "big paws" badge. Racing and planning don't always go together, but then again, my wife really liked it. Could be the rating goes up as the two-sided sled-speed and braking arrangement becomes more intuitive. 

Update: It's time to bump this up to a "7." I broke down and bought this because my wife was very enthusiastic about the game. She and I are getting quicker about planning our moves. I enjoy each play a little more as we become more familiar with it.

I gotta admit, there's some nice variation with all the possible tracks to build. And, bonus points for a good-natured and funny rulebook.

I have been wanting a race game for a bit and this seemed like a great theme.  The rules seemed pretty straight forward (once I wrapped my mind around drifting through the turns) and we were up and running quickly.

I see that the game could summer from too much AP, especially with a larger group.  It took my quite a few head scratches trying to negotiate the first U-turn.  But I also think with more plays, I would have left myself better cards and a sharper sense to resolve it more quickly.

All in all a fun game and I look forward to playing it with more.

Fragor's latest game doesn't have the cutesy components of their last few releases, but it knocks the cover off the ball in terms of fun and playability.

Snow Tails gets the racing game genre right: simple, fast-paced, but with plenty of excitement and a touch of randomness to keep things from being [i]too[/i] predictable. Players have a dog sled with 3 components: 2 dogs and 1 brake. Each of these items has a rating between 1 and 5. They also have personal card decks with cards between 1 and 5. Players, on their turn, each have a hand of 5 cards. At least 1 card [i]must[/i] be played to modify one of the dogs or the brake, multiples can be played only if they are of the same value (i.e.: can play two 5 cards but not a 4 and a 5). Movement is simple: sum of the dogs, minus the brake is speed. If one dog is faster than the other, the difference between the two is the amount of sideways drift that the sled will have as part of its move. A bonus move is available that is higher for those back in the pack if the sled is balanced with evenly powered dogs.

What makes the game potentially hairy is the damage component: the sled can take damage when various bad things happen including crashing into the side of the course, entering a turn too quickly (ala Formula De), or, my personal favourite, ramming through not-so-conveniently located treeples at mach 5 on your rocket powered sled out of Hades. Every time you run into something or violate the speed limit on the curve entry (cue mental image of dogs bursting into flames), you end up taking damage cards which sit in your hand of 5 and reduce your options. That's it, first one across the finish line wins.

The game comes with a number of tiles which have simple (standard course) sides on one side, and evil components on the other. The evil tiles can be either chicanes, straight-aways that narrow to one lane, or the aforementioned forest of death where trees sit in the middle of the course and menace people who come through, particularly the first people to come through, as they are mowed down when struck.

This game is excellent, everything that I'm looking for in a racing game: speed, excitement, and a modifiable course because of the modular tile choice (great idea guys). It fits into a small space of time, and is easily the best game in its niche. This is what I was wishing Ave Caesar was like when I played that title. I'm flat out thrilled that this has been picked up for wider distribution because it's a great title that I think will have extremely broad appeal.

This is a good game to illustrate the concept of forces to young people, but it can be difficult to play with adults that do not grasp the physics of forces.  Your dogs pull your race sled and the sum of their pulling force is the direction that you go.  Not very complicated, but evidently a little tricky for some to enjoy.  Myself, I like the theme and the mechnic.  The Big Pause/Paws token is a fun touch as well.

Very simple rules that could be explained to an 8 year old in a few minutes, yet I've only played it with people aged 35-70. Edge-of-your-seat tension, surprisingly. Plays fast, like 20 minutes for a 2 player game. When the current player is taking a lot of time deciding their move, that gives the other players time to figure out their next move too, so there's no feeling of downtime. Everyone's engaged all the time.

Middle to low random factor. Perfect.

Here's an anecdote. In March 2014, I took this into one of my local game stores and played it with the man who ran the place. He'd never heard of it before. In the end he said Snow Tails is "an excellent, excellent game" and thanked me numerous times for bringing it in. "This is exactly my kind of game", he added, and decided to get some copies for the store.

RATING: 7
A game about racing sled dogs along a track through the snow encountering hazards along the way.  Players manage their sled by playing a dog left, dog right, or break card.  Curves and turns require drifting left or right while speed limits require close attention to speed.  The rules capture the flavor well.  Better still, the game is thinkier than is expected from initial impression.  It's important to plan ahead, manage your hand of cards, and decide whether to take dents which reduce your number of playable cards.

House Rule: Use a turn to rest and repair (discard dings) a sled.  It helps to keep the game playable with 2.

Good looking game with a nice theme. Suffers from a runaway leader problem which can be addressed via home rules. 
After a few plays, my rating has dropped one point because the game doesn't generate enough excitement around the table and lacks player interaction.
Everybody is concentrated on their next move and doing their maths.

I played a short demo with Fraser Lamont during Spiel 2008, and discovered that while it appears to be 'just another race game', it is actually a bit more difficult than one might think at first sight. Fraser  turned out to be one mean musher, and finished before I was even halfway. I suspect this game is more about the activity of doing stuff than actual hard thought. I'll join in a few games when asked (hence the somewhat higher rating bordering on a 6), but won't buy the game as it is too expensive for what I'd get out of it.

So far I've only played this by myself, to learn the rules.  It seems like good fun, but I couldn't really figure out some of the markings on the corners.  I'm sure it's just me being dense, but if I can't figure out, how am I supposed to teach others how to play?  

So my first impression is that it's a bit "sloppier" than I prefer in a board game, but as I said, I haven't even really played it yet.

Components: Fun artwork on the course. Quality tree and sled markers.

Experience: One of my first racing games. There are only two decisions to make on a turn: how fast to go, and how much to drift. But those decisions can be tough, given the cards in my hand, and how I think it will influence my next turn. It's fun to drift skillfully around a corner.

A friend of mine developed a Horse racing game that he's never tried to publish(calls it Steeplechase). he's basically trying to mimic the Triple Crown. It has three races. You can set the track up anyway length you like and you have cards that have different speeds, jumping abilities and lane changing abilities. Other cards give you special abilities. Up to you how and what order to play the cards. If you don't have enough jumping power though, you can run into the hurdles which causes you to wreck. I don't like it that much, but the mechanic in Snow Tails of changing lanes seems interesting to me.

Very fun race game, I like it better than Powerboats, the other Essen '08 race game I've played.  There are enough things going on in the game and  it feels well balanced.

It's uncanny how much this feels like how it seems like it might feel to be controlling a dog sled!  Not that I've ever done such a thing.  But still, the mechanics make those things really hard to steer, and difficult to change direction especially (I mean coming out of a left-hand turn and into a right-hand turn, not just any old change of direction).  Nice bits too.  Better with more sleds - even if that means two players taking two sleds each.

With more plays still like it, but I don't think the catch-up mechanisms are powerful enough.  Tournaments are probably the way to balance it.

Quite expensive (€ 35,-) for a racing game.
Anyway, my biggest fear was it would be very similar to Mississippi Queen, which didn't do it for me.

After 2 plays I must say it's more challenging (compared to MQ) and definately more fun. The idea: balance your 2 dogs and brake by using cards and pray you stay on the track. It takes quite a bit strategy and thinking to get the job done.

I really didn't like this game - the artificial speed limiters (speed bumps at the turns), and the matched card mechanic made the game clunky. It felt like I was fighting the mechanics the whole time. I liked the damage system, but I would remove the speed bumps and only enforce card sets for the dogs, not for the brakes as well (allowing players to place a card on the dogs and another on the brakes in one turn).

RATING: 7
Interesting sled racing game. The movement of the sled is ruled by three numbers: dogs pulling you on (2 values) minus braking, while the relative strength of the pulling dogs dictates the drift. The mechanism is clever, though it may be prone to Analysis Paralysis with very slow players. The modular board provide high replayability.

This is fantastic, light race game.  The rules are simple, but the gameplay is tense.  The dent cards and the resulting loss of options is a fantastic mechanic.  It forces people to take risks and push their sled to the max.  I have never seen someone win without taking a few dent cards.  Usually the person with the unharmed sled is sliding over the finish line last.  The components are top  notch, and the variable track is a wonderful addition.  If you enjoy race games, you should have a great time with this one.

Mmmm, yummy race game. As with most race games, this is a heap of fun provided people play it like a race... fast! And the more the merrier... crashes and spills.

The trio of cards to control speed and direction is an inspired design choice which creates a lot of tense decisions. ("Mmm, 2 5s... I could really put on a burst of speed with these, but how would I slow down and turn later? I've got a 2 so I could turn really well, but...")

It looks good too. Winner.

Traded away, because I bought El Grande.

Solid racing game with modular track. But I already own formula d, which is simpler to teach and play. In snow tails, figuring out your movement is tricky and creates a lot of down time. Like formula d, a racing game that crawls along at a slow pace, so mechanics and theme mismatch. I want a racing game that actually feels like a fast race!

OK, I am an addict for racing games, and this one is as good a racing game as it can be.  It is fast, furious, tense, extremely fun, and full of agonizing decisions - should I go for it now, or wait just a bit, so I can manage through this corner unscathed. Really, really lovely.  It's everything you would want from a racing game.  Even the theme fits perfectly.  The hand and risk management is non trivial and it really gives one the feeling of racing - I cannot praise this the game highly enough. The tracks can also vary quite significantly (there's a lot of track tiles included), so the experience is somewhat different each time and the game will feel fresh each time.  You cannot go wrong with this one.

It's hard to make a good race game that is not, on the one hand, a puzzle, and on the other hand, has some re-playability.  Snow Tails finds a nice balance between the two.  It is a bit like a puzzle, which takes away from the feeling that you are in a race, but it is that depth which gives it re-playability.

RATING: 9
A PERFECT racing game.  Equal resources from Ave Cesar plus the movement of Formula De plus a unique engine mechanic.  Every single move requires thought and planning.  Total thrill.

The theme is really important to the movement mechanic, but is kinda lame.  Star Wars pod racing is what this needs to be.

And the fact that increasing the thrust on your right side makes you turn right instead of left is so ridiculously wrong from both a common sense and physics standpoint that we (2 PhDs, 1 Masters, 2 Programmers) all thought it was a misprint.  It being intentional should cost this game a point.

Update: Sooo... not one of the five us have actually raced a dog sled though.  Turns out the two lines of dogs aren't attached to the front, they are both attached to a common center line.  So pull harder to the right of that attach point and you do turn right.  Huh.  I lernd something today.

Players are racing dog sled teams down a track.  Players on their turn must play one or more cards of the same value onto their sled - either replacing either of their two dogs, or using the card to change the braking value.  They then move the sum of their dogs, minus their braking value.  The clever bit is the only way to steer your sled is by putting a stronger dog on the side of the direction you want to turn.  If you crash off the track (easy to do), you have to begin clogging your hand up with useless "dent" cards, limiting your future movement options.  Simple mechanically, but very clever stuff.  Racing games are easy to get wrong, but this one got it right.  Enjoyed this one a lot.

Good racing game that is a nice step up from Ave Ceasar in terms of gaming satisfaction.   In AC you just play a single card to move, here you control 3 components of your sled:  two dogs and a brake.   The track is modular, looks a bit like a snowy Formula De' including some speed concerns in the corners.   I'm not a huge fan of racing games, but this one seems to pretty much get it right.

My wife and I really like this game, though it does suffer from a lack of a catch-up mechanic. In a racing game, it's important that all players remain competitive throughout the race. If a dogsled falls behind in this, it's very difficult for it to catch up. 

While I like the math involved in using the brake, we are going to try using Snow Tails 2 rules, with the buildings, lack of a brake, and no speed-regulating turns.

For me, this is a much better alternative to Formula D.  It probably has a lot to do with the theme (Dog-sledding in Canada!) and the fact that the game is card driven instead of being at the whim of dice.  I probably haven't played enough of either to give an informed opinion, but I know which I would give another chance and which I wouldn't.  One minor gripe about this game is the change in graphic design between the original Fragor edition of the game and the new Asmodee edition.

Another Ave Caesar inspired racing game. The mechanics of Snow Tails that intrigue me the most are the catch up mechanics. The saplings fields and the balanced sled bonus integrate seamlessly into the play of the game. The lane changing mechanic driven by cards also interest me. Overall, I really like the seamless mechanics and design of this game, but how much I really like the experience is still needed to be determined. 

Another play suggests to me that I really like the game on paper, but the actual gameplay is just a little too weak for me. Turns take too long, the balance between what you can do and what you want to do is too high, and it seems rather hard to catch up with the leader.

I waited patiently to get my hands on the Asmodee Edition specifically because I loved the cover art. I love the production quality, the innovative idea of a dogsled racing game, and the variety you can get with the different tracks. You can customise tracks yourself or you can use the many suggested setups in the rulebook. However, it does not feel like a racing game so much as a thinky math exercise - you are constantly calculating your speed minus your brake, and if you have a balanced sled then you have to take your bonus movement into consideration, and then you have the hand management aspect and how many dent cards you take etc. etc. The 'drifting' can take a while to get your head around but it is very thematic. All of that can sometimes slow the game to a crawl. Also, this is one of those racing games that is interesting to play, but not very exciting with just 2 players. Lack of an effective catch up mechanism can make it absolutely painful to play to the end.

Playing this reminds me of Toledo which is also a race game (a race to make swords for the Alcazar). I find both of them to be an average 2 player experience with a lack of tension or excitement. I rate Toledo a 5 and in general I would rate this the same but it gets an extra 1.5 for well integrated theme, excellent components, and the additional spatial challenges of moving through the race course – curves, trees, narrow gaps, speed limits etc. Much prefer K2 and Little Dead Riding Hood for fun race games with 2.

Looks great. Basic driving mechanism is fun.

While i like it, it runs long and there's no good way for those at the back to catch up on curvy courses.  Worse, anyone who's had a crash early on loses agency permanently (they are allowed fewer useful cards in hand) so the game is less fun for them ("hope you enjoyed your crash - no more fun for you") and with fewer options they'll get further and further behind.  Thematically in keeping, but anti-fun.

This is almost the perfect racing game for me.  It has enough control, and some ability to look ahead, but not enough to take away the "do you feel lucky?" aspect that any race game must have.

I really enjoy this race game which is surprising as I am not a fan of race games. 
I am still awful at in and it is becoming a joke that it is a victory for me IF I cross the finish line. 

The mechanic for the dogsled with the dogs running at different speeds allows you to turn the sled is really nice idea however there is always confusion as to which way the sled turns when one dog is running faster than the other.

The speed limits (and minimum speeds in the case of the leap of death) add enough planning that there is very rarely a run away leader and people (not me) can usually catch up and thus make for a very close finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice new twist on the old favourite of racing games (that being a grid with diagonal moves and crashing). The combination of the drifting and the movement mechanisms is very nice. We only played the opening course once, so I'd like to get moe races in, but one player got into a clear lead and literally raced away, while I bumbled the first corner, which stuffed my whole race. I wonder therefore if there is no recovery. That doesn't break with the theme in my opinion, but does not make for a fun game in the long run.

Play before you buy.

I think this is my favorite racing game.  Well made, changeable track. Faster than Formula D, with fewer rules.  Lots of opportunity to crash & burn.  Draw of the cards is certainly luck based--wish for a little more control here, but then wouldn't have as many burns & crashes. I have played with 5, 4 & 3--I like best with 5.  

This may be a problem--so far after 3 games, after about the 3rd turn, the sled in the lead has won every time.  For shuffling, wish the cards were bigger.

[3 plays] As the newness starts to wear off, I find myself actually wishing it were a little lighter.  I often work very hard strategizing for the upcoming segments, only to find someone gets in my way and now I don't have the cards to do anything but take two dents and end up in bad position for the next section.  Still, a very innovative, fun game that is accessible yet still presents interesting decisions for gamers and my favorite race game to date.

Basically it's a racing game with multiple variants to make it more interesting.  There are speed limits, hand limiters, and bonus, truthfully it is a decent racing game. I however just wasn't a fan of this game.  Yes it's interesting and can be changed up, but really I was very very bored playing it.  I just wanted it to end.  It seemed that once I got into 4th place I couldn't catch up and if I balanced my sled well that would send me way over the speed limits.  No thanks.  I'll pass on this game in the future unless they really really need another player.

The best race game I've tried so far.  Against Formula D there's no contest IMHO because: you can customize the tracks, there's more strategy in terms of where to put your cards to ensure you're set up for future turns, and there are more obstacles you can hit.  The production is stellar for this tense game.

Aranyos kis szánhúzó verseny. Szuper pályákat lehet építeni, amikhez viszont elég sok hely kell. A kártyaletevős mechanizmus egyszerű, de nagyszerű. Menet közben derül ki, hogy mennyire jól hozza az érzést. Az előző kör lépései erőteljesen hatással vannak a szános irányíthatóságára. Illetve a legkisebb sérülés is rengeteg ront az kezelhetőségen. Annak ellenére, hogy családi játék, van benne számolgatás, döntés bőven.

Snow Tails is roughly in the same league as Formula D(é). The use of cards instead of dice and the additional movement dimension you have to think about (you cannot simply move left or right when you want to like in the aforementioned game) give it a vastly different feel, however. The drifting mechanic makes it a quite a bit more thinky and also a bit more challenging to stay ahead of the competition. Unfortunately, it only plays up to five.

Fun racing game.  I don't think I'll play it without trees again.

Definitely not a two-player game, but with five, there is a massive amount of jockeying for position.  Easily the best racing game I've played yet.  Much, much more fun than Royal Turf (although the betting makes that one more unique) and the trees and other environmental factors give this on the edge over Ave Caesar.

Simple racing game with quite a bit of charm to it. Fun with family/friends. Feels lacking with two players, shines with more players. Too much number crunching for certain players, however. While I like having it in my collection, it's not something I see breaking out frequently with the same people.  

Keeping it because it serves a niche purpose: easy to introduce to new players, it's the only racing game in my collection, and impending fatherhood makes me think it'd be a great mathematical exercise for young kids.

I vastly prefer the Iello version over the Renegade games version. The art has more character, and the wooden components are better.

I don't care for race games, but this one shines a bit because of the card play - interesting combination of the addition and subtraction (speed and brake) combined with a thematic turn mechanism and obstacles that cause damage and reduce the number of cards you can subsequently hold (similar to Robo Rally.)

A fun game with a creative touch on how your sled moves due to the speed of the two dogs pulling it. At first I didn't think anyone was going to finish as the turns can be brutal enough, but then trying to straighten out afterwards also needs some planning. It may take some people a few plays to get used to the mechanics of how the dogs pull your sled, and can be a bit mathmatical, but not overly so. I personally found this game to be a lot of fun and a good challenge. You get alot of track pieces to make a ton of tracks with. Of which are alot better quality than the pictures make them out to be. The direction manual is very well written and easy to understand. This was a definite worthwhile purchase and I am looking forward to many more plays.

A very fun racing game, that involves a lot more strategy than something like Formula D. Of course, the rules are also a tiny bit more complicated, so it's possible some players might not "get it".
It hasn't been hitting the table all that much. I generally play Formula D with non-gamers (a huge hit), and play more complicated stuff with my regular group.
But when it comes out, it's a bunch of fun. Pushing your luck and seeing how damaged you can be while still crossing the finish line is a hoot.
And I want to try a little handicap while playing with the wife: remove all of the 5 cards for my sleds.  I think this will balance things out a bit so we can have neck-in-neck races again.

Sled drivers bounce off walls and sustain damage as they lead packs of huskies to the finish line. It actually feels more like a bobsled race with all of the getting knocked about.

It's definitely the best racing game I've played. I love the crazy turns and strategic hand management. The rules are very simple, but there's a lot to think about. The basic arithmetic can slow things down slightly, but that's about the only negative thing I can say. I like the very slight balancing of players in the back getting more bonus movement. It's enough to give everyone hope, but not enough to completely break the game and make good play irrelevant. I like the dent mechanic, that you're only punished by reducing options. It's enough to punish mistakes, but still allow for some risks. The track really matters and there's plenty of options to change things up and make really interesting tracks.

This is basically Super-Advanced Ave Caesar. The killer twist here is that your dogsled's movement is controlled not by one card but by three. You have a left dog, a right dog, and a brake. Your movement is both dogs minus the brake. But you also have to consider your drift from left to right. Whenever one dog is stronger than the other, your sled is pulled in that direction a number of spaces equal to the difference in strength. These drifts are like enforced lane changes, and they're the only way to change lanes in this game. The values assigned to left dog, right dog, and brake will remain in effect until you're able to change them, and you're never able to change them as quickly as you'd like. What seems like a strong move this turn may end up sending your sled careening toward disaster the following turn.

Great stuff on the whole, although the turns sometimes feel too slow when people are having trouble planning their moves. The designers, the Fragor brothers, have anticipated this problem. The game comes with a "Big Paws" marker that can be slapped down in front of the offending slowpoke. The Big Paws doesn't actually do anything, but it's a cute idea and a helpful reminder to keep dogs moving.

Initial rating of 8

This game keeps getting better the more I play it.

I am a race game fan and often have a difficult time rounding people up for a race....not with this one! People line up to play and we often have people watching and commenting on position and card play even the occasional oooh and aaahh at a clutch moment.

Superb blend of luck and skill that rewards players that can plan ahead based on the upcomming track and cards in hand. However, never count out lady luck. A perfect card draw can go a long way here.

The catch up mechanic in this game works very well and can even be used as a point of race strategy.

The overall mechanics really bring the theme out in this game. They feel like they were made for the game and not just created then lightly covered with theme.

You can (usually) tell by the middle of the race who the "new guy" is by his lack of understanding course correction. This is not a bad thing as the learning curve is pretty shallow. However, newbies usually get rocked by the experienced guys their first time out on the snow swept track (yeah, you are the exception Kris).

With a field of experienced mushers the game is tense and full to the brim with tough meaningful decisions.

Once you get a good feel for the game you can almost look at a track and just see where the optimal path is...now you just need to take it before the other guy cuts yer ass off (ERIC!)!

The one thing that ties all of this together is the fact that you can teach the game and run a mild to moderate course in less than an hour!

I love racing game and I'd love to love this game.  We played it twice yesterday (4 players) and had quite some fun.  Racing is challenging and requires quite some planning. 

However I fear that Snow Tails has a balancing problem as soon as the distance between the carts becomes too large.  If you gain a notable lead in the middle game you'll most probably win.  If you fall behind in the same situation you'll probably lose.  The game has a mechanism which helps players running last to gain speed but unfortunately there are many speed limits which make this speed gain often useless.  Furthermore the speed bonus can only be applied when the cart runs smoothly straight ahead which happens not too often since most tracks are rather bendy.

So all in all I really like the game but I feel that too much is already decided in the mid game rather than in the finish (which shouldn't happen in a good racing game)

Some AP because of the arithematic involved plus the spatial reasoning. 

But not that difficult of a game to teach. And it's usually enjoyable by both rabid gamers and non-rabid gamers. 

Of course, if a gamer isn't afflicted with rabies, why the hell is he playing games with me?

My favorite new game I played at ABCGF. I am realizing that I love racing games in general, but I was worried this one would be too fiddly. It is definitely not. The steering feels very natural, yet still challenging. It manages to make you think about your choices without feeling like a puzzle or a push-your-luck exercise. The variety in tracks is very high as well.

This is the only racing game i enjoy. The theme is totally there & the components are top notch.

I would however heavily suggest playing with an 1 min. hourglass, otherwise due to AP, the racing becomes sloooooooooow moooooootioooooon..
We played with the rule that if after one 1 minute you didn't finish your turn, you couldn't draw up to 5 & if you wouldn't finish after another minute you get a crash card. This was super fun..! Because then people really get into the racing feel, and it's hilarious when peoples slides bump over trees & or against each other.

Lowered rating from a 10 to a 9.  When this game gets suggested, it just isn't as high on my list to play.  I think it's a fantastic game but I've lost the excitement I once had after quite a few plays.  While the modular board makes for a good amount of replayability, you're still limited to a set of pieces and a fairly basic rule set that doesn't have too much depth.  This is great in that it is easy to teach and is playable by anyone, but after a dozen or so plays also shows that there isn't anything new to find or happen when playing again.

I still think the card management is a great idea in comparison to the roll-and-move of Formula D.  Getting dents is more detrimental now than I once thought it was.  I just wish there were some more options!  It's still a great game but I just feel like I've seen all there is to see with it.

Very reminiscent of the old Waddington's race game Formula 1, but this comes card driven with a modular track (why didn't other race games think of that?) and obstacles and employs the startlingly novel concept of braking as well as accelerating. The track needs to be long enough for each player to exhaust their card deck, otherwise luck of the draw becomes a much bigger factor. Don't be afraid to take a dent or two, you won't win without. Great fun, one of the best race games around.

3-5 players? Racing game with cards. Players can be eliminated. Player interaction is limited to sled collisions and bonus movements. Some people mention having few sled collisions with 3 players and having a runaway leader. youtu.be/LE8W2HmEewc shows a 3-player session with unexciting gameplay, no sled collisions, and a runaway leader for half the game. Snow Tails is similar to Automobiles, but the latter seems fun because it involves bag building.

Wow, surprisingly good.  I had heard that is a really fine racing game and I didn't dispute it, but I must've not really believed it at the same time.

And here it is - a clever, simple mechanics brilliantly representing the real race.

I won't buy it, mostly because I'm not a fan of racing games in general.  But if you are a one, this is definitely a title to check.

[I also have some concerns about replayability (despite different tracks), limited decision-making and inability to catch the leader once you fall behind (sometimes very early), but I won't dwell on them since I'm not the fan of the genre in the first place.]

As it is - an enjoyable if long filler (not more) - for me right now.

Initial Rating: 3.5 (November 2013)

I dislike racing games, so it is no wonder I don’t like this game. The bits are really cool and the game components and art have a good quality, however I found the game to be exceedingly simple, I played only the basic rules, but the decisions are pretty obvious so you can play the game on automatic. I would play again with the advanced rules, but I feel (as the game is so easy) that the player who wins is purely down to luck. Also (due to the same luck), I feel this has a runaway leader problem.

I will definitively sell my copy. For now I will try to stay far away from it, far to simple for my taste, perhaps a good game for new players and/or family.

Often my game-dar is right on the money.  By reading about a game's mechanics and extrapolating from experiences of similar games I can often tell which games I won't like even before I play them.  I avoid a lot of bad gaming experiences this way.

With Snow Tails I got it wrong.  From watching a couple turns and reading a little I was convinced that this was Ave Caesar with sled dogs.  As I loathe Ave Caesar this game was an easy pass.

I was wrong about Snow Tails.  It excises the single most irritating part of Ave Caesar - the blatant encouragement to players to force others to skip their turns.  That's bad gaming.  Snow Tails, with its large track, modifies this into a little light obstruction.  Obstruction is at the heart of racing games, and is implemented rather well here, as opposed to the clumsy implementation in Ave Caesar.

There is also more control over the sled with the ability to play cards in both left steer, right steer, and brake.  Snow Tails feels like a race instead of a draw-and-move.

Of course there is some irritating randomness in the cards but it is handled rather well here.

My experience with Snow Tails was quite positive, proving that I don't always get it right with respect to which games to avoid.

Clever and fun racing game. The 3 sled values and the drifting mechanics are wonderful, but the surprising, and surprisingly effective, twist is that all cards played on a turn must be identical. Why would they require this? I'm not exactly sure, but it does add just the right amount of challenge to the game without bogging it down. Lots of replayability with the modular board and the components are really nice. Very good family game that gamers can enjoy as well.

Un juego de carreras muy especial.

Para llegar a la meta necesitas sobrevivir a todos los obstáculos que encontrarás en la "carretera". Para ello tienes que mantener a tus dos huskies y tu trineo en equilibrio jugando cartas numeradas del 1 al 5 sobre ellos.

La suma de la potencia de los dos huskies menos el número en el trineo te dará tu velocidad. La diferencia entre el perro de la izquierda y el perro de la derecha determinará cómo puede girar el trineo.

Por supuesto, este juego está lleno de situaciones donde puedes golpear tu trineo. Cuando eso sucede podrías obtener cartas adicionales que reducen tus posibilidades de movimiento.

Parece un juego divertido para "no pensar", pero no lo es. Snow tails es un quemacerebros, en el que necesitas planificar tus próximos 2-3 movimientos de antemano ... si quieres tener éxito.

A very special race game.

To reach the finish line you need to survive to all the obstacles you will find on the "road". To do so you have keep your two huskies and your sled in balance by playing numbered cards from 1 to 5 on them.

The sum of the power of the two huskies minus the number on the sled will give your speed. The difference between your left dog and your right dog will determine how can your sled turn.

Of course, this game is plenty of situations where you could hit your sled. When that happens you could get extra cards who reduce your movement chances.

It looks like a funny "no thinking" game but it is not. Snow tails is a brain burner, you need to plan your next 2-3 movements in advance... if you want to succeed.

[b]Thank you Secret Santa 2010![/b]

I haven't had this much fun with a light game in a long time. Dog-sledders, approach the starting line.

A turn in Snow Tails is simple. Players have a hand of cards that allow them steer, brake, and accelerate. The mechanic for this is extremely cool. If the right dog runs faster than the left, then the sled pulls to the right by an amount equal to the difference in speed. This really captures the feel of careening around corners as fast as possible. If both dogs are running at the same speed, they are considered to be "in harmony," which boosts the sled's speed by an amount equal to it's position in the race. This captures both the feeling of sprinting forward on a straightaway and the sense of determination if you're behind. It's also possible to run into obstacles (trees) or take a corner too fast and damage your sled. This reduces your hand size, which makes it more difficult to control the sled. Again: brilliant.

There's just enough here to engage you without compromising speed of play. It's hands-on excitement. It's the kind of thing I bet I could get just about anyone to play, and that's rare.

2008 is already one of gaming's best years by a long way.

The comparison with Powerboats is obvious and in fact both games fill the same gaming niche. Both are pretty good racing games that keep the balance between possibilities for clever play while maintaining playability by a random factor to keep up the pace and avoid endless planning. I have bought Powerboats due to playing it before online. After first play, I like Snow Tails even a bit better but not enough to buy it as well (really too similar niche) or trading off Powerboats. Snow Tails offers more planning possibilities to gamers but is also more analysis prone. It even includes a bear paw as a gimmick to push slow players into action.

A tad more thinky than Formula D, Snow Tails solves some of the problems posed by trying to emulate racing in a board game in similar ways, with speed limitations on corners, damage for collisions with obstacles, and the like, yet it reduces the luck by quite a bit by replacing dice with cards that allow you to affect your forward movement, direction, and breaking. I especially like how damage makes your sled less maneuverable by replacing slots for movement cards with dud "dent" cards. There's still some counting, as in Formula D, but you also have more control of your fate, and the designers' gentle mocking of slow play via the "big paw" token puts things in the proper perspective. Snow Tails has nice components, relatively quick gameplay, and the potential to adapt down to younger players (e.g., simpler courses, no trees, etc.).

The drift mechanism is really the entire game, the only thing setting this apart from other race games.  But that is enough to make it fun.  It's a unique and fun theme, and it helps to make the mechanisms more intuitive.  I also like that there is only one race, rather than multiple laps.

My main gripe with the game is play time. As with all race games, the longer it lasts, the less fun it is.  I have the feeling that it would probably play quicker with more experience, but turns should be relatively quick.  Having to count out the spaces and look at your option takes a little longer than it should.

RATING: 7
I've only played this once so there's the chance I might boost up the score after multiple plays.  In first reading the rules the game seemed pretty straightforward, but no one in my group had played it.  I think it turned out to be more difficult than I expected, perhaps due to the fact I got the impression it was a good introduction to racing games.

I think part of the problem was the attempt of the rule book to be a little to lighthearted and humorous.  There's two spots I'd like two have seen better examples of:

1) Drifting into the corner.  It's still a little confusing for me what is considered a "legal" forward and drift in the corners.  The example in the back helped a little, but not quite enough.

2) How exactly the different solid and outline dimaond symbols on lines in the corner worked.  The example was  good for the simple case, but a more complex one with three or four sleds would have helped.

Some organization would have helped for the rulebook as well.  Putting some of the examples all the way in the back of was probably unnecessary and also the way the graphics were laid out it seemed that some crucial ones ended up under different sections.

I'm looking forward to trying again, but the craving isn't as strong as it might have been with the rulebook addressing the above issues.  Off to look for player guides.helpful for sleds right next to each other, but was confusing how those symbols related to the others on the grid.

I'd also add that I would add some components for first time player.  The main thing would be something to indicate the starting position as beginning players are grasping the drift.  (Or maybe even enough components to leave a "trail".

Boosted the score.  With reading the examples again it seems a bit easier to teach.  I still think the corners are going to be tricky at times, but so far works out. A decent two player game if you both play with two sleds

RATING: 7
A snow racing game which an clever mechanism for moving the sleds left and right. Firstly, components are wonderful (tracks, the trees, cardboard sleds) with the exception of the wooden sled markers. It would have been nice to have something with more detail on it.

The game itself is okay, but I found it too slow because its a perfect information game. Each player can spend time checking each combination of cards and seeing how beneficial it is. For a race game, this is bad for the pace of the game. It loses excitement because everyone is so engrossed in calculations.

Snow Tails is a very fun racing game. I suppose once you got the hang of it, the braking system is an interesting element. But most players seemed to struggle with it and so I think I'm more inclined to pull out Mush Mush which ditches the brakes and allows for higher player counts.

2. 印證了，睇人仆街最開心的道理，自己快不快不重要，看著別人炒車就已經滿滿的歡樂。尤其是沿著那個牆邊一直炒XDDDD
3. 雖然是一個很簡單的遊戲，但不代表完全無策略，如何去思考行動的位置，從而為下一步做留牌準備是需要思考的。而互動則在於根據對方速度能到達的位置預先進行卡位的安排。

Played it three times now and had fun. I would not recommend to play the "Nutcracker" track, as it is too easy and will most likely be won by the sled leading before the first curve.

Played it now with my girlfriend. She needed some help for the first two curves but beat still beat me after a great last round. 11 steps. Foto finish win. I was happy for her and pretty impressed how she catched up and won the race.

Sessions are a wee bit long, and the game is a wee bit luck-driven, but it's fun nonetheless. While there is a respectable degree of controllable randomness, a bad draw can completely ruin someone's day. While all the players will likely have poor draws at one point or another, the timing of said poor draws is quite relevant. Easy circuits are less luck-driven, but also less exciting.

So even if flawed, it's a really fun game! Definitely my favourite racing game. Like playing a game every so often.

Snow Tails 2nd Edition is better then Mush Mush... in my opinion. Getting harder to find. 

Snow Tails is set in the snowy world of the Arctic Circle, where brave sledders compete in a test of skill and endurance. Action is fast and furious and not all sleds may make it to the finish. Huskies only have one setting and that is full speed! Hang on to your furs, the reins, your sled and anything else you can get hold of.

Creative mechanic for this fun racing game. Three cards are used to control speed and steering; however, the method for how the cards are played and the other sled dog teams on the course require careful planning. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good example of a game that I respect but don't love playing.  This is a very clever little racing game that utilizes cards to drive three elements of your sled.  The system allows for a great deal of player control given the random nature of the card draw as you can plan ahead for multiple card plays on subsequent turns.  My only play was slowed with downtime between turns though and there's not enough here to sit through that.  If I were to play a racing game of this type, I'd always pick Formula De because the random die rolls add an excitement that this lacks.

Snow Tails uses many of the same mechanics as Formula D but is less random because no dice are use. I am not convinced is a good thing because this basically makes the game on long mathematics exercise. This is evident because in every game I play, each player looks at me to make sure they moved correctly. This is not good if players still are unsure if they are moving correctly after E-V-E-R-Y turn.

I'm a racing game fan and this is a racing game with an original mechanism for speed, steering and helping the slowpokes catch up. The variety of tracks and obstacles help make the game a lot of fun.  

Player elimination is possible, but unlikely except in desperate end game maneuvering and I call that a good feature, not a flaw - the tension of whether you can make the final turn at high speed is good stuff.

There is one drawback to this game.  Do NOT play it with people prone to overthink. There can be a lot of down time while the infamous "analysis paralysis" player ponders his or her choices. Zzzzzzzzzz

Not a bad game really. Was expecting something like Formula D but it turned out to be a little mathsy from balancing your left and right huskies and your brakes. As it turned out to be a bit mathsy, the turns can be a little drawn out and can sap out the fun of a racing game. I only played this with my significant other with 2 sleds each so maybe playing with more players might make this game more interesting.

I'm not particularly fond of racing games. Many suffer from downtime and a lack of endgame mystery. [i]Snow Tails[/i] doesn't escape these problems, but it's one of the best I've played. It's like the hand management of [boardgame=494][/boardgame] married to something vaguely like the vector movement of [boardgame=18481][/boardgame].

My favorite aspect is that steering is incorporated as a tactical card play mechanism ("drift"). This is also part of why some commenters complain about the math. To put things in context, we're talking about three operations of single-digit addition or subtraction. There aren't that many variations that make sense to try, and you can work out much of it between turns.

My least favorite part are the speed limits. That feels like a band-aid.

Modular board, great bits, fun theme.

The sleigh dog mechanism, although nifty and not without its strategic possibilities, confused me a greatly because in most instances, things (marching bands, waves, ships) tend to curve towards their slower side. Since nobody else in our round had this problem, you probably won't either. 

Apart from that, it suffers from a usual problem of racing games: it's too slow (at least with five players it is).

It can be a little math-y, so it may take a few plays before you can play more intuitively. It plays well at a lower play count than Formula D and relies on cards instead of dice.  They will compliment each other nicely.  The hand management allows you to plan two turns ahead so it helps mitigate some of the luck.

Not a bad game, but a little dependent on the luck of the draw.  In one game, I got great cards and flew through the game to an easy win.  In my second game, my cards were not kind and we played with several variant boards.  

I got stuck in the trees and could not move for 5 turns (and the end of the game) because the trees were just before the hairpin turn, so I couldn't go straight and I was stuck between/behind the side and a tree just before the 3 limit.  Miserable and pointless...  I guess the lesson is to be careful about where you put the alternate boards. 

This game is like Formula De meets Robo Rally meets Duell meets Mississippi Queen/Black Rose.

Очень здорово влияют на процесс игры - ёлки. Советую играть с ёлками. При чем одну партию играли с произвольно составленным полем и часть елок расставили хаотично. Например у поворотов, у ограничителей скорости, даже 1-2 ёлки способны создать кучу проблем игрокам и заставить их попотеть. Простая, веселая игра с несложными правилами. Полностью создает ощущение гонок на санях(ёлки реально привнесли много в игру).

Brilliantly simple game, but not as shallow as it appears. I can see it not sitting well with some, but I disagree that an early lead cannot be beaten. I've gone from trailing all game to a final turn push to victory.

So far disappointing, but I've only played the beginner's track. It just seemed like the combination of the track and my hand played me rather than the other way around. There also wasn't any way to catch the leader - there weren't any significant obstacles and the frequent speed limits meant players in the rear couldn't use the balanced dogs bonus very often. I expect the more difficult tracks would fix some of this.

RATING: 7
What I like:
- The puzzle element of figuring out how to move your sled
- You can build your own routes with the tracks
- Varied obstacles available

What I don't like:
- Routes with lots of turns makes it difficult to catch up
- Can be AP-inducing, and could be difficult to fully plan your next turn because people in front of you could block your path.

Based on reviews I trust I was thinking this was going to be a holy grail for me.  Instead it kind of fell flat.

The movement system is certainly clever, thematic and very well thought out.

The problem is the pacing in the game.  I want most race games to fly around at a brisk pace.  I guess that is my expectation.

Snow Tails is perhaps to clever for its own good.  We struggled constantly to play cards effectively without taking excessive time. And many times we allowed mulligans to ensure all wasn't lost for the player. 

With a timer perhaps the game would be better for me.

Clever but not fast like I expect in a race game.

I am quite fond of light racing games as they're good for introducing non-believers, and make for a pleasant evening's trash talk. This one's quite clever in its hand management mechanic, though I think, if you're going to use the saplings, you need to make some choices. I tend to use the sapling graphics as "possibles" and just put a few "treeples" out over the specified spaces. I mean, really, it's hard not to get beaten up if you put them out in the density shown. Then again, why not just stick them on random spaces rather than the prescribed ones? I mean, what's to stop you?

I was sure it will be a huge hit with us, but I was wrong. The steering may be sophisticated, but I forgot about that it needs some basic math, and it didn't prove that intuitive as I thought. My kids can count well enough, yet they couldn't handle the sleds too well, even my wife had difficulties [size=5](mainly distinguishing right from left)[/size], so I'm afraid it isn't for every family. I still like it, though.

I really enjoy this unique take on a racing game.  Managing the cards for turning and speed is very clever and presents some challenging strategic decisions in the game.

If I have to play a non-wargame or non-AT game, let it be like this one. It's diabolically simple, quick, requires some skill and some luck and doesn't pretend to be about anything important. It's just a goofy dog-racing game. It doesn't make a lame attempt at a "serious" theme in order to distract you from the same-old, same-old boringness of its existence. It doesn't disguise the limited interaction or clog your brain with labyrinthine victory point calculations or auctions or role selection. It is utterly without guile. You just race your stupid dogs, try not to smack into the wall and get over the damn finish line first. I could probably play this twice in a row. Most Euros I don't want to play twice in a lifetime. Or, for that matter, once in a lifetime.

It's "only" a 6 because it's not a great game. In most ways it's a totally inconsequential nothing of a game. But I don't feel like scrubbing with bleach when I'm done, and I haven't sucked away an entire evening doing math problems disguised as a "game." It probably deserves a 5, but I'm bumping it up because it accomplishes that highly improbable feat of making me willing to play it again despite the lack of explosions and zombies, or exploding zombies.

Enjoyable game to play with the little ones. Eventually, I find the runaway leader problem a little too large. Also, while the card mechanic does a very nice job at simulating the challenges of driving a sled and forces some nice hand management at the same time, I think I'd prefer dice in my race games. It just wasn't as exciting as I'd hoped after playing it a few times.

RATING: 8.5
A card-driven racing game.  Like Ave Caesar, players all start with identical decks, and then play cards from these decks to make their sleds move forwards.  However, the game is much more complex and tactical than Ave Caesar.  

Movement is very well done.  The sleds can have cards played on them in three spots: two dogs in front (which pull forwards) or the brake.  The speed of the sled is the sum of the two cards in front minus the brake.  If the two dogs in front aren't pulling at the same speed, then the sled "drifts" either right or left, which is crucial to navigating turns (and getting around obstacles).  

Crashing into the side of the track, exceeding speed limits, and running into obstacles all damage your sled; damage is tracked as "dent cards", which reduce the number of cards you can hold in your hand.

The game is highly customizable: it comes with many different track pieces, meaning that a wide assortment of tracks can be built; this should give it great replay value.

Overall I quite enjoyed the game; it's a nice step up from Ave Caesar.

[Update: Upon additional playing, I wonder if the advantage of the leader (more freedom in planning moves, since they don't have to worry about running into someone) isn't overly strong.  I'm curious about adding in a house rule to reduce this: possibly banning 5s, or playing the turns in backwards order (5th goes first, then 4th, etc.).]

10/17/09: After a first play, this is a 6, but it could move up.  I do find the way the game models momentum and speed to be quite good, but I find that the mathematical aspect of the mechanism overwhelms the theme.  (Nothing felt particularly doggy about the game.)  We also had a runaway leader problem, but trees could help that.

I'd definitely play it again and see if greater comfort with the mechanics helps with the theme.

I wasn't really expecting to like this very much but was quite pleasantly surprised. The game is ridiculously simple, but each turn you do have to be careful to plan out your move carefully, keeping the next turn or two in mind. Best of all, the game is quite fast. I've played only on the basic tracks, and I think the more "advanced" set-ups would provide some interesting challenges. Unfortunately, nobody else seems all that interested in this title, and it's not so compelling that I'm going to haul it around and advocate for it. I'll gladly play it if someone else wants to and would pick it over pretty much any other race game I'm aware of (Formula De, K2), but I definitely don't need it in my collection.

I love this game, but my wife is not as big a fan. Her reaction really surprised me. I thought the theme and simple mechanics would be a big hit with her, but she is convinced the luck of the draw determines the winner. My friend Bob and I have tried to explain how the multiple copies of each card, along with drawing almost every card over the course of a race, mitigate the luck factor. However, she won't budge, which is a shame, as this is a great, light racing game.

This is a fun little racing game, I could see myself playing this once or twice a year; but I don't think I would ever suggest it.  The rating of 6.5 means I've giving it a slight knock (where "7" is kind of "normal").  I think the problem with the game is that the card-play mechanism is a bit too puzzly for a game this light. So it occupies this awkward place where it is a bit more thinky and difficult than I want for a game that is otherwise so light.

Régóta ki akartam próbálni, végre egy társas esten lehetőség adódott rá. Az egész játék gyönyörű, a hangulat pedig magával ragadó! Egészen addig, amíg el nem kezdjük játszani.. Onnantól kezdve csak számolás, ami még nem is lenne a baj, hiszen így kicsit logikázós (amit én szeretek), viszont egyáltalán nem szórakoztató!! A látványon kívül más nem váltott ki belőlem érzelmet, semmi izgalmat nem lelt egyikünk sem benne. Annyira nem, hogy a célvonalat előrébb hoztuk (oké, azért is mert az egy szem lánynak nagyon nem tetszett). De mindegy is milyen hosszú, hiszen végig ugyanaz történik, semmi változatosság. Lehet ha végigszánkózunk a pályán, izgalmasabb? Legközelebb, inkább matekkedvelőkkel..

RATING: 7
A racing game that uses Husky Sled racing as its theme. The mechanics do a great job of simulating the nature of the sport two as players can only cards of the same value on a given turn and if the left and right dog team have different values, it will create drift to the appropriate side. 

This game is really about hand management and positioning as players approach and exit corners. To throw in a few extra twists certain spots feature speed limiters and the players must be on or under this speed if they don't want to suffer damage.

Throw in trees, chasms and modular tiles for track creation and Snow Tails is a pretty decent game. 

The calculation and forward planning required can be a little taxing at times and slow up the play if someone isn't experienced. This may be a deal breaker for some.

I don't tend to like racing games that much, but Snow Tails is a good one. It's a very clean and straight-forward design that utilizes cards in a very unique way. My only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be a lot content in the box, and I almost wish that there were a few more tracks or something just to add some variety. I'm a little unsure if this will stick around, however, because while I really enjoy Snow Tails, racing games aren't usually my thing.

This is an incredibly fun racing game. I like it a lot more than Formula D, although I may be somewhat biased because I also enjoy the theme of dogsled racing.

Instead of dice rolls, the gameplay is based on cards and you can play up to 3 cards (with the same value) from your hand in the same turn. This gives you a lot of options, but it's still very difficult to stay on the right path and avoid taking damage from the snowy terrain.

I recommend this for at least 4 players since there will be more chaos in larger groups and that makes it more entertaining.

Played twice with 5 and 6. Some neat mechanics but it is way too long for what it is. Card-play is a bit too restrictive. The major problem in this game is there is not much catching-up mechanics and there is not much player interactions. It is too difficult to control your sled already and there is no room to plan against your opponents.

As for racing games, I much prefer Ave Caesar, Breaking Away, Circus Maximus (in New Games of Old Rome) and Calabande and Marco Polo because they are all quicker and more player-interactions involved than Snow Tails.

Snow-dog-sled racing game.  I love the mechanics to this game even though they can be confusing and frustrating.  Why I never seem to have the cards I need I will never know.  You have two cards representing how fast your two dogs are pulling.  If the numbers are even, they pull you straight, if they are not, they pull you to one side depending on which side is higher.

Be careful, you will want to evade obstacles and the edge of the board because if you crash, one of your cards in your 5 card hand turns into a useless crash card.

Very enjoyable racing game that always makes me think outside of the box of normal racing games.

it is a little more interesting than ave caesar. the race track is modular, obstacles can also be added, and 5 cards are in hand instead of three, of which 1,2 or 3 of the same number can be played to three areas of the dogsled(they represent pulling strength to left and right and braking strength). crashing to the sidewalls and to opponents or stepping over a speed limit is possible. decisions therefore less easy to make than in ave caesar and the race can slow down. i am not a big fan of racing games, but when a race game slows down it becomes really boring for me. do not play with AP players.

Nice quality components and the graphic art is really good. I would have appreciated more tiles; it's a race game and being able to make very different tracks would have been great.

The game works smoothly with most players, with some occasional downtimes when a player experiences a difficult moment. You can only plan in advance to a minor degree, because the player that moves before you is likely to block your path (unless you're first).

The mechanism to move the sled is clever and great. It what drives this game and makes it worth to be played.

My main issue is the runaway leader problem. It's not easy to overtake the leader, because he will usually take the best available path, and the followers will have to deviate from that. Removable obstacles (trees) do help with that. Usually you will need the leader to get a bad hand or to commit a mistake (something not likely to happen if he has time to think).

This has a very cool system for determining speed and drift, but people who don't like math in their board games are going to hate it, simple as it may be.  Lots of fun.

Simpatico e immediato gioco sulla corsa delle sled dogs. Trattandosi di un gioco di carte regna sovrana la fortuna ma non mancano le possibilità di cercare di governare la sorte valutando il peso del rischio da prendere. Un gioco semplice e veloce alla portata di tutti. Più adatto a famiglie che a gamers accaniti.

RATING: 8.5
Beautiful. A gloriously simple yet versatile design complements a well-written rule book and lovely, effective art. The intuitive and brilliantly-incorporated movement uses a mechanic borrowed from Street Illegal but makes it far more dynamic and amenable to next-turn planning. There is a genuine racing-line strategy not found in games such as Formula D, and that's the winner for me. It does tend to hurt the brains of people not familiar with racing games and the correct way to take corners.

Very good racing game.  The course determines the length (space and time) and difficulty of the track.  Your hand determines how you can move.  Elements of Robo Rally (hand limit and damage causes few cards to be able to be held) and Formula D(e) (grids on track).  There are obstacles on the course (ala Mississippi Queen Black Rose) but there are also destructable objects (trees cause damage but are destroyed).  There are also speed limit checks that if you go over cause damage.  Has a clever movement mechanism (left dog, right dog, and brake).  You add your dogs and subtract your brake for movement but if your dogs are not equal you get pulled to one side or the other during your movement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good solid "race game". Features tight hand management, and a clever use of the 'dent' cards meaning the more accidents you have, the harder your sled becomes to steer.

Must admit to finding the rules as written (asmodee 1st ed.) frustrating - with attempts at rather lame humour constantly hiding the actual rules of the game and leading to frustration while trying to learn the game.

規則
*將賽道組在一起保持黃旗在左側，紅旗在右側，起點的1號跑道必須在第一個彎道的內側
*玩家選擇一個顏色，拿取該顏色的雪橇圖板、雪橇和哈士奇卡，將數字為3煞車板塊放到雪橇圖板的挖空處，將哈士奇卡洗勻置於雪橇圖板旁當抽牌堆，隨機起始，照順位擺在對應起跑位置，抽5張哈士奇卡當做起始手牌，第4/5的多抽1/2張
*遊戲進行多輪直到終點，每回合照位置最前面的先動作，平手則由靠近下一個彎道內側的玩家先行動，終點前由靠近格子旗的玩家先行動，玩家回合有三個階段
1.出牌  出1~3張數字一樣的哈士奇卡，分別放在左或右或棄牌堆，一個位置最多一張，棄的那張拿對應數字的剎車版取代雪橇圖板上的
*若玩家沒有哈士奇卡可以出，則抽一張凹痕卡，再將手牌補足5張之後正常出牌，凹痕卡卡手牌
2.移動雪橇  往前移動左+右-剎車的數字格，左右相減等於橫移格數，往數字大的移，橫移跟前進會合併成一次斜向移動，若橫向移動格數比縱向格數多，則多出來的格數被忽略，斜移時雪撬不受前方與左右的雪橇干擾。
*玩家可以決定橫向移動在什麼時候發生，只是在完成縱向移動時必須完成全部的橫向移動格數。
*若抽牌堆用完了，將雪橇圖板上左右兩邊最上方那張卡保留，其餘的牌和棄牌堆的牌洗勻面向下成為新的抽牌堆繼續遊戲。
*只有前進時(左右數字相同)至少一格(第一回合除外)，可額外前進目前名次格(可完全不要)
3.將手牌回復到5張  超過則棄，不能棄凹痕卡
*玩家在過彎通過線時時要低於圖板上顯示數字的前進速度，超速會領到等於差值張數的凹痕卡，之後在彎道上就沒限制了
*碰撞時回合立刻結束，停在前一格，該回合不補手牌
*滑出賽道  移動立刻結束，停留在滑出賽道的前一格，拿一張凹痕卡後，補滿5張
*抽到五張凹痕卡時，玩家被淘汰，若是過了終點線才領到第五張凹痕卡，該玩家還是獲得勝利
***特殊賽道****
>樹群   若使用樹群賽道，請將樹木指示物放在標有樹木的格子裡，雪橇撞到1棵樹玩家就必須在移動後抽1張凹痕卡，被撞的樹移出遊戲
>峽谷   紅線外和左、右兩端的石頭不可通行，若超出紅線或撞到石頭，視同滑出跑道做處理
*當所有還在跑道上的玩家通過終點線時，遊戲結束，照通過順序排名，同回合通過比看誰比較遠，還是平手，則較靠近黑白賽車旗那側的玩家獲勝。

Here's a race game I enjoy. It doesn't have a cracking pace, but there's a nice decision to make every turn on how to manage your card hand to set speed and turn power, whilst giving yourself good options to manage same on the next turn. And there's smiles to be had watching sleds go horribly wrong occasionally. Thumbs up.

Although it appears interesting, the mechanic is a little annoying and gets a little repetitive. you have very little options on what to do and just try to make the best of what you have. Race to the finish, but to switch lanes you must drift across lanes and speed is not always your friend. Don't make the track too long though, cause it may get boring by the end.

This racing game is based on playing cards with numbers printed on them, to affect your speed, direction, and brakes.  There seemed to be a good mix of wanting to go fast, wanting to go slow, and wanting to go in specific directions.  I was having a little trouble with the spatial orientation to figure out which direction I was headed--and I'm usually good at that sort of thing.

RATING: 6
Good racing game, with a very nifty moving mechanic: you play numbered cards on your left and right dogs and, if one dog has a higher value than the other, your sled drifts to its side. Drifting is the only way to make the turns forcing the players to manage their cards carefully.

A little bit AP prone, if played with the wrong people, but otherwise a very enjoyable and interesting racing game. Play with 4 or 5 players only as blocking is an integral part of the game and it's absent with lower counts.

RATING: 7
Very effective steering and speed mechanic and they make sense for the dog sled theme. The dent mechanic is effective at limiting your choices later in the game. The built-in catch-up mechanic is a nice thought, but you don't always have the cards you need to pull it off or the speed limit sections prevent you from using it. 

This is a really solid addition to the race genre. The game is definitely more fun with the maximum number of players to clog up the track and provide more opportunities for collisions.

Very good initial impressions. The card-driven movement is very fun, the graphical style is great, and the large number of track pieces means there should be a lot of replay designing new courses. I like that this has the random element from the cards as opposed to something like the deterministic energy mechanic from Leader 1, as it reduces the amount of computational look-ahead and keeps things moving along.

Update: Now that I've seen the new Asmodeé style, I'm quite glad I picked up the Lamont Bros edition. The cartoony feel is perfect (for me, anyway).

The "Biggest Paws" award now gets threatened in every other game that provokes AP.  The theme is charming enough that even non-gamers can enjoy it.

You really feel like you're steering a barely-controlled sled as it skids back and forth across the ice.

Fantastic race game with a unique left/right steering & braking system. There are plenty of different track pieces allowing a large variety of tracks to be created to keep the game interesting.

All the components are great, though the box is perhaps a little over-sized.

Not quite as interesting with only 2 players as interference is less, but the identical decks that each player has means that if one player gets in front early, the other player is likely to have better cards later and be able to catch up. An alternative would be to play with 2 sleds each & you only win when you get both sleds to the finish.

Solid 8. Thinking is fun again! Sure, sometimes you want think about maximizing your prestige points without depleting your resource cube stock, and there's plenty of games for that. But when you want to figure out how to steer your sled through the trees without hopelessly crashing in the next turn, there's Snow Tails.

What I really like is how you can make a short, no heavy thinking, straight-curve-straight-single obstacle track to play with your parents or your buddies at the end of game night, OR you can make a nightmare course where you need RoboRally-trained puzzle-brains just to survive. Highly recommended.

Could this be one of the better thematic racing games, which seemingly plays quick as you can only play 1-3 cards of the same value from a hand of 5 cards. 

The stumbling block to pace is once again the counting of spaces, but an additional problem is players grasping the concept of steering/lane changes.

One drawcard for me compared to other racing games is the movement bonus ala the detective play in Hoity Toity: if your sledge is balanced, you move additional spaces according to your position.

Like Formula D but with cards instead of dice. The "serious gamer" may prefer the apparent decrease in luck in the game as you are guaranteed a certain distribution of values to work with via your cards, and the drifting mechanisms are neat.

Ultimately though, rolling dice is more exciting than playing cards, and the specific applications of cards required means luck still reigns supreme.

I'd probably rate it higher if I hadn't played Powerboats a few times recently too.

Way too fiddly and overproduced.  The brake cards should be incorporated onto the individual player boards (rather than a tiny little piece that had a circle cut into it that is supposed to be positioned just so on top of the brake numbers).  Also, the pivot is unnecessary.  If a player really can't figure out from the colored flags what is right and what is left, let them walk around the board.  Anyway, it's just Mississippi Queen without the elegance.  Instead of turning, you play cards to unbalance your dog team, thus making you pull to one side.  Meh.  Essentially a math, card counting, and planning game, and not a good one at that.

If you are used to the ingenious simplicity of Ave Caesar, all other racing games have to stand up to the test of the Roman chariot racing game. Snow Tails is one of the few racing games that I enjoyed. It takes a few turns to get your head around the rules but once things begin to slide, it is all in good fun. However, I am not sure how much long-term strategy there is to the game as you can only really see your next two or three hands but I suppose that is what you want in a racing game, more feverish thrill than dull planning ahead. The board and general artwork look amazing, a shame the sleighs look a bit dull. Good racing game, will probably go up in my estimation after more plays.

Able to sit down and immediately play at a game night.  There are many different suggested "boards" that can be built with the pieces, some more difficult than others.  Be sure to use the easiest one to explain the game.

Immediately playable... only tough part is making sure everyone knows their right from left and how drifting works (I had to explain that a dozen times).

RATING: 7
A lot better than I would have guessed. Fast and playable. Play cards to adjust speed for left and right dogs, as well as the brake. The turning mechanism is perfect--if one dog has a higher speed than the other, then the sled has to move the difference in that direction. Like most race games, the more players the better. I only wish there was a chariot racing game with this mechanic.

I really like the way the sled is controlled with cards.  This is what makes it a bit more fun for me than say, Formula D, a somewhat similar racing game.  The "drift" mechanic just seems to make sense.

Components are great - featuring thick modular board pieces and nice wooden trees and sleds.  The manual was cleverly written - and the big paws token is quite funny.

This superb game has simple rules and nicely challenging gameplay. I think people of all ages can enjoy it.

It's fantastically non-abstract. Each turn you allocate one or more cards (from your hand of five) of the same number to any of the three positions on your sled - dog 1, dog2 and brakes. Then you simply tally-up those three pushing/pulling forces to see how fast your sled is going and whether it's veering to the left or right. Then you move the sled and draw back up to five cards.

There's a small random element to the cards (which definitely adds excitement) but mostly there is an art to planning and playing them. The result is a sense of momentum and a constant feeling of being only parly in control!

If you hit things you take damage, which permanently reduces your hand size and makes your sled even harder to control for the rest of the game.

Players can sometimes block each other, which is fun. There's also a strategy around how hard you try to avoid trees etc (when you hit trees you take damange and clear the path for players behind you). And you can manipulate turn order a bit. All good stuff.

There are a couple of modest, well-integrated catch-up mechanisms too. They help to keep it tight as well as family-friendly.

I can't score it 9 or 10 because it can't immerse me enough. But this is still one of the most finely honed games I've ever played.

My only criticism is that certain players (myself occasionally!) may turn this fast game into a slow one if they fret for ages about which cards to play. It can be a problem. The game even has a 'Big Paws' (aka 'pause'!) token you can give to a slow player to force them to speed up.

Has some complexity but is still easy to play.  One needs to find the right point to push the limit to win.  It's racing but utilizes a mechanic with the dogs that is different than anything else.  Just good racing fun. Probably plays better with more people than 2 but still fun with two if you make the track really challenging

What I like the most is that it encourages out-of-the-box thinking.  There is more than one way to achieve what you need, but you have to be open to puzzling it out with what you have.  For that reason, I think this will be especially fun with my family and teenage sons.

15-02-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Snow Tails ia a fun racing game. Snow Tails is an interesting racing game for its mechanisms. In snow tails you play cards to determine your speed towards left/right, and the amount you break. You can only play cards with the same value, so if you really need to break 3, and steer to right 4, you'll have a problem. You steer to left or right based on the difference in speed.

I did like the game, but I felt it very thinky. More thinky than I might be comfortable with in a racing game which I feel should be quick and light.

This was my favorite technical game during BGG.Con '08.  Normally I'm luke warm on most racing games, but the mechanics, tracks and risk in this game made for an outstanding experience.  Managing your hand while trying to decide just how fast to enter the corners is just half of it...  Within your card plays you must also manage drift (your ability to change lanes.  Great game!

I was disappointed by this.  I'd heard a lot of good things about it, and I love race games, but I think there are better ones around.  One major problem seemed to be that in our race, with not many straights, it was very hard to catch up the leader when they got a turn ahead.

Simple idea. Well executed. A decent racing game. In fact, if you're in the mood for a racing game this this is the one that'll have you doing more racing than calculating, unlike some other games from this genre. It doesn't try to be more than it is - a fun racing game.

Has improved a little bit in my ratings. Although it can be a little slow with new players as they struggle to figure out how to steer this contraption, after a few turns they're up to speed and the game starts to move along at a good clip. With experienced players I'd introduce a timer if players start to over think, but amongst reasonable players that's probably unnecessary and people can just enjoy it for the fun of it.

I'd suggest the finish should always be preceded by a long straight, so trailing players can balance their sleds and get their bonuses. A close race is a fun race.

Plays quickly, could play with ages about 8+ I reckon, sit back and enjoy the sled ride.  A whole pack of fun.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, and nor should you, 'cause you'll ruin it.

Sit back, enjoy the running into the side of the track, limiting your hand size, run up the bum of the sled in front and then clear a path straight through the trees.  It's a hoot.

RATING: 5
Very original and interesting racing game for 2 to 5 players. My favorite part of the game is the damage system. Your damage scales up exponentially, so the first dent you take isn't so bad, the second hurts more than the first one did, the third one hurts much more and so on. This is in direct contrast to most racing games, which feature an all-or-nothing threshold damage system or at best a linear system. It's even slightly better than RoboRally's damage system.

Speaking of which, a lot of RoboRally shows up in the game. The real-time frantic action and bumping into each other is gone for cold hard math, but the formula works very well for fewer players (whereas RoboRally needs many players to be fun).

The steering system is very nifty and realistic if you think about it (don't swerve too much!).

The only problem is AP. Players can get really bogged down on a turn as you have many options and many things to consider. Planning your next move while others make theirs is key.

Snow Tails -- 

Played three-player once.
Played four-player once.
Played five-player once.

I'm rather ambivalent about racing games, but this one really suits me.  The use of left team, right team, and brakes to control drift and speed make each turn engaging.  The theme and mechanics integrate seamlessly.  The saplings add some nice decisions.  The requirement that a sled drift in the corners is thematically consistent and it keeps my interest.  The speed flags preceding the corners add an appropriate amount of challenge, but more importantly, they help control pace.  The bonus movement for balanced sleds provides just the right amount of catch-up for those who have fallen behind, with the possibility for doing more than just catching up. 

Snow Tails has an elegance which makes the game feel familiar.  As of my third play, I've never suffered a dent.  Time to start taking more risks!

Snow Tails is a great racing game. The drifting mechanic makes steering intuitive. The balanced sled bonus allows for those trailing behind to catch up on straightaways. The modular track allows for a wide range of play experiences - from relatively easy courses to fiendishly difficult ones. If you like the idea of a racing game, get Snow Tails!

[3 plays] Loved it. Easy rules, straightforward objectives, but subtle strategies to hand management. A point or two of damage (dents) appear to sometimes be worth the price, so don't rule out taking a hit now and then if it improves your position for the next turn or two.

Most recent plays 9-16-09 with Donovan and then I taught a game on 1-2-10 with Andy, Joel, John S, and Michael.

Great racing game.  I like the hand management and trying to control the drift and the bonus moves vs trying to manage the speed bumps.  Lots of great little decisions that add up.  

I do wish that the bonus didn't have to be all or nothing, because of this, it seems that it often helps the leaders more than the people in the back of the pack.

I love that you equipped with a bag of dogs (your hand) where you just pull new dogs out to fire the ones that you are already using.  

This is the first Fragor game that I'm interested in owning.

This game is much more my style than Formula De.  1st, I much prefer the "do the best with what you have" idea of cards in Snow Tails over the "gamble on the dice" idea of Formula De.  2nd, dogs and sleds are just a cool theme.  I like the way the curves force you to drift, and the bonus speed mechanic adds another layer of depth.

Rating based on only one play so far with two. I'm sure it will increase when played with more. EDIT: Actually my rating didn't increase. It is fun to watch others slowly (or rapidly) accumulate dent cards and lose control, but there is an awful lot of counting and recounting in this game, painfully slowing it down. This, to me, is exactly like Fearsome Floors: if played quickly, great game, but if played "to win", it loses a lot of appeal.

Here's another game polarising my opinions. After 2 plays, I enjoyed one immensely and the other dragged. I think the problem I have with it is, due to its nature, that there are no catch-up mechanisms. If you're having a bad race out the back, the likelihood is that you'll stay there and might be half a course behind by the end. It can be unforgiving, therefore this is not up the top of my list to play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Pretty cool race game, and probably the best so far from Fragor despite (or due to?) the lack of cute sculpted bits! Simple rules but still a lot of strategy/tactics. The card play reminds me of Ausgebremst, but the track is wider so it's less about blocking ... a good thing as far as I'm concerned! I've only played it with 2 but this was a lot of fun -- one of the best race games around! Some randomness (cards), but everyone has the same deck and there are some decisions about how to play the cards drawn (so it's manageable?). And it's not a bunch of annoying dice-rolling like Formula D/é! 

--- Summary ---
Race courses are built randomly. Players each have a dog sled with 2 dogs (initially valued 3 each) and a brake (also 3). Each player has the same deck of cards (5 sets of cards 1-5, shuffled) from which they draw a hand of 5 cards. On your turn, may play 1-3 cards of the same value to these 3 locations (dog1, dog2, brakes). Forward speed (and distance moved) = dog1 + dog2 - brake + bonus (=position in race) if (dog1 = dog2). Lateral movement distance = dog1 - dog2 (move to the side with the stronger dog). Certain parts of the track have speed limits; you take damage if you exceed them, or if you run into obstacles (ice patches, side of track, etc.). Damage = cards that take up space in your hand (so 5th damage --> out of the race!). The first player to cross the finish line wins!

RATING: 5
A nice family game but a little light for my own tastes.  If I had a short amount of time to squeeze in a game and/or was playing with a much more casual group I wouldn't take too much issue in playing this again though.

The game has a lot of math in it (which you need to be able to do quickly in order to not hold up the group too long since what you do can change over the course of other players' turns) and quite a bit of random luck.  Each turn you draw up to 5 cards from a deck unless you previously crashed into another racer or the course with the latter being a more permanent handicap.  These cards have numbers from 1 to 5 on them and you play any number of the same number each turn on one of two dogs or your brake.  These numbers dictate your speed and whether or not you turn on a race course.  That's it, pretty simple.  Try to finish first and try not to crash.

My first game we played with a reasonably short and not too difficult track.  Out of curiosity I wouldn't mind playing on a more dastardly setup.  There are some course pieces checkerboarded with obstacles or that have a one lane bottleneck.

I purchased Snow Tails because of my mother-in-law, she is always trying to get us to play Monopoly and I thought she would like the subject matter since she knits booties for sled dogs and watches the Iditarod.  I think it will be simple enough for her to grasp but still deep enough to offer some strategy.  My first solo play suggested this is the case and I can’t wait to play this with a group.  This diverges form most racing games by offering a simple card laying mechanic to drive our sled.  Basically you have to navigate a track with spaces on them and there are hazards and corners in which you have to navigate.  You can lay cards in three ways to affect how your sled moves.  There is a right husky, a left husky, and a brake.  You can lay 1, 2, or 3 cards in your turn but all must match  in value which ranges from 1-5.  The speed of the sled is the sum of the left and right minus the brake.  When you move you move your sled the result of your speed, in addition your sled drifts to the left or right the difference between the right card and the left card.  For example, if your cards were, right 4, left 2, and brake 2, you would move forward  a total of 4 spaces while at some point during that movement, drift to the right 2 spaces.  All-in all, it looks really interesting.

Come one, who doesn't love huskies! Okay, but seriously, I really enjoy playing this game. It's simple enough to explain to an 8 year old but has enough strategy to play on adult gaming night. And the options you have in building a track! OMG so many!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another good racing game!  The idea of having left and right lane shifts determined by the difference in strength between your left and right huskies is the key bit of cleverness that turns Snow Tails into its own special thing.  The other details have also been nicely worked out.

This game has AMAZING mechanics.  The way the sleds move is truly brilliant.  I love the dent cards and how they reduce your options.  That said, I didn't love the gameplay.  I was hoping for something a bit faster, with a bit more tension and harshness to your decisions.  It's a really awesome game and I can see why it's rated so high, but it just doesn't click for me.

I love this game. Not sure why. The extremely clever and unique velocity mechanism forces you to plan ahead and makes each race exciting.

Most of the fun of Ave Caesar with quite a bit more complexity and a lot more variety. Blocking is much harder and you really do have to manage your hand of cards, but overall I really like it.

It is tough though to catch a runaway leader, especially on a winding track.

Update: The runaway leader issue really is a problem and the only solution appears to be to have a lot of really long straights - which is quite dull.

Rating down from 7.4 to 6.6.

I very much enjoy racing games, and this one is one of the better ones.  It's a fairly quick playing racing game with not an overwhelming amount of luck.

Nice game, you have some options. The idea with the marker for a long thinking player is great ;) The problem is, the game should be faster. Too much downtime. And when you are the last, ore the first, it`s hard to change it. When you have more than 2 damage cards you still play, but you`re out. Maybe it would be better with expirience players (with this game)?

It's a sled dog race, but with an interest card hand management method of moving rather than say, a boring dice game. The fun of this game really involves whether or not it's a close race - early games of this were like that for me, but haven't been able to replicate. On average, game is just OK.

Here is a very clever and unique racing game.  The turning mechanism (stronger pull on one side of the sled) is excellent and challenging to manage.  It is great fun to plow across a speed check or through a forest, damaging your sled but maintaining that all-important speed!

Several friends had given this rave reviews, which may have contributed to my great disappointment when I finally got to play. Snow Tails isn't bad as far as card-driven race games go, and the mechanics do seem to mesh pretty well with the theme. However, the games seemed a little dull to me. Everything here works, but it's just not as fun as I'd expected from a race game with interesting mechanics, cool-looking tracks and a decent theme. I'd certainly play again, but I'm also pretty sure I'll never need to open up space in my closet for this one.

RATING: 7
Played 5 player twice, once with basic track and once with a track with s-curve, trees and avalanche. Very nice components. The game is definitely a bit fiddly and there is a runaway leader problem (both games, the leader was unchallenged). There can also be a bit of analysis paralysis, but that could just be my game group's play style. If played quickly, I can see this being a lot of fun, especially since the quick play would probably cause more crashes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Snow Tails has some neat ideas, including dents that limit your effective hand size or cards that sway one's direction.  But without the attention to realism of Formula D or the visceral combat of Ave Caesar, this race game just falls flat. No difficult decisions are made.

RATING: 6
Played at Essen Spiel 2009. Race game - interesting for the genre, but race games in general are always a little bit repetitive. The way to change direction is interesting, but not enough to make the game really exciting for me. For one game it was fun, though. I enjoyed crashing my sledge into the target (four dents - one more and I could not play any more). If you like racing games, you will enjo moments like this.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.75
Tough game to rate.  I have not played many racing games, so my comments may be taken with a grain of salt.  

There seems to be very little tension in Snow Tails--and I have played 3 and 4 player games.  It is  the most purely tactical game that I have ever played, just beating out Hansa.  I can't figure out why it seems odd, but it just feels a bit lacking in tension, which is one element that I would think a racing game would have.  

And yet I really enjoy it.  It can be largely determined by how each player's cards come out--I can't see a way around that fact.  No matter how well you play your cards, there is a decent chance that you won't get that 5 or 1 when you most need it (for example, when heading into a turn).  In spite of this fact, it is a good game, and one that some people that I have played it with ask for immediately.  

Go figure.  It is a mystery.

UPDATE:  You know, after thinking about it for awhile, my thoughts might be a little bit clearer.  There is so little interaction in the game.  And that does not seem right for a race game.  Basically, it is just a race to see who can optimize the hands they are dealt better than everyone else.  Maybe that is the nature of most racing, but I guess I was expecting a bit more in the way of interaction.

I'm not much of a race-game fan. But this one creates such a fun numbers puzzle that it's a really good time. I think I've finally found on a race game that might stay in my collection with Snow Tails. More time will tell. And I definitely need to try it with more players than just two and with some of the tougher race terrain. It seems adding more moving parts and obstacles would only increase the puzzly element.

A 7.5 for now, with potential to improve.

RATING: 7
Interesting game mechanics for determining sled movement by playing cards from your hand with your choices constrained by only being able to play cards with the same number. The damage mechanism is elegantly integrated by filling your hand with useless cards that cannot be discarded. I can't imagine playing this endlessly, but nevertheless it's a good, solid game. Initial rating of 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I waited too long to get this into my collection.  I love race games and this is one of the best.

Beautiful components, modular track, plays quickly (most of the time) and uses a fun mechanic for movement.

The only thing I don't like about this game is that it can be very difficult for some players to figure out how to move properly.  This can really slow the game down and be a bit frustrating. It is not unlike RoboRally in this way. People do eventually figure it out, but the first play can be a turn off to some.

With a group that can handle the mechanics, though, this really is a blast.

Update: rating moves from an 8 to a 7 for two reasons. First, I a have gotten harsher with my ratings. Second, more plays have further born out what I wrote above. It doesn't always click with people.

When it does it is great as it is one of the few race games that can scale well to fewer than 6 players (without running multiple racers each) and plays in under an hour. Plus the play is unique among racers as well as fun.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2


Overall - 1

Good, solid, fun racing game.  The variable track set-ups are great and let you adjust play time to fit your available time.  The math isn't hard, but combined with the spatial aspect of the game could be an issue for some (and can lead to the occasional long turn).  However, I've found that after just a couple of plays it clicks with people and gameplay proceeds much more smoothly.  I was worried about the comments that the leader coming out of the first turn always wins, but have not found this to be the case at all.

Played twice with two and three players. I can imagine it being even better with more players. The game reminds me a bit of a cross between Formule De and Ave Cesar: Like in Formlule De you have to take speed limits and player sequence into account, like in Ave Cesar you select cards from a limited hand set. And it works beautifully. Gamelength is also about right as far as I am concerned: A bit shorter than the other two games I mentioned. The only complaint one could have, is that you really need to calculate your options each turn (making it more brainy than you might expect based on its components).

My favorite part is that you have a bag of dogs on the sled with you, and are leaving behind a trail of used, discarded dogs behind you as you replace them. This is a pretty enjoyable, novel race game, and one of the best in the genre. However, the bonus move "catch-up" mechanic, is total BS, as it usually helps those in 1st or 2nd place more than those in worse positions, since they'll rarely have an occasion to use that much movement without taking heavy dents. I've proposed a variant where you can choose how much of your bonus move to use, but haven't gotten to use it yet.

The three factor left-right-brake system does an excellent job of capturing the way the sled has a tendency to keep going the way it was going on the last bend even though the next bend is looming.

Dogsled racing with variable courses and movement using cards. Easy game to understand and teach and fairly strategic with the hand management aspect of the card-driven movement. Positioning on the track is another important tactical element, especially when going around corners or through the special track segments. Plays best with 4-5 players, game length varies depending on the length and difficulty of the track design. Fun game - fills a fairly unique niche in my collection as the only other race game I own is Winner's Circle but that has more to do with the wagers than the race. Another simple gateway race game I like with the right crowd is Cartagena (but I do not own).

Very fun racing game!  The theme is great, the production quality is great, the art is fun and thematic and most importantly, the mechanisms all work fantastically well together.  We initially laughed at the dogsled spinner and I promptly needed it to help clarify which way my dogs were drifting ;)  The "treeples" are very cool and sending your dogsled at full speed through trees to speed to the finish line is quite amusing.  I could practically smell the sap and taste the bark from the branches that must have been sticking out of every part of my poor dogsled.

I have an [-]Alaskan[/-] Michigan Malamute, and she says "woof, woof, bow wow, awoooo!"  Which means, - buy this game if you want a really great racing game.

A 'cuter' racing game that my family might like to play. 1st play - More challenging than I thought it would be. It will take several more plays to figure out how to maximize your movement each turn, We added the "trees" board to the second game and that was very cool. Look out!

For my money, this is the best racing game out there. No dice, all skill (at hand management) with highly customizable tracks and easy to learn mechanics. If you like racing games and want to feel like you actually won the race instead of the dice winning it for you, this is the perfect game for you!

Decided to cancel my pre-order after playing twice. While the card/sled system for movement is novel and very clever, the interaction between players is virtually nonexistent and in both games I saw a clear runaway leader from about 1/3 of the way through the race. I just don't see the game being interesting enough in the long run to justify actually buying it. I much prefer Leader 1 when it comes to race games.

What a nifty little game!  It's like a quick-and-dirty Formula De, only with different ways to control what's going on with your car, and with less luck.  A lot of the mechanisms make sense in relation to the theme, and the neat way that you manage your cards to be going the right speed at the right time reminds me a bit of the market manipulation from Jambo, of all things.  The game definitely starts to get more interesting on the more difficult tracks, though it's probably not a good idea to teach someone the game using those.

Fragor's 2008 Essen release is set in the snowy world of the Arctic Circle, where brave sledders compete in a test of skill and endurance. Action is fast and furious and not all sleds may make it to the finish. Huskies only have one setting and that is full speed! Hang on to your furs, the reins, your sled and anything else you can get hold of...

The game contains modular track pieces which can be fitted together to form different courses. Players have their own Dog Decks which they draw from and play onto their sled mat. Movement is rarely in a straight line as the sled may drift left or right. Losing control or speeding into a corner results in Dent cards being acquired which will limit a player's hand size.

This is a very clever racing game that uses a deck of cards to determine the speed, drift and maneuverability of racing dog sleds. Game play is super quick but there are a lot of decisions to be made and a ton of risks to be taken. As for a direct comparison to another popular race game Formula De, there is less randomness in Snow Tails than in the F1 classic, but the finishes tend to be a tad less exciting. Basically, I find that the meat of Snow Tails is in the middle sections of the track where most of the obstacles are located. How you handle them largely determines your placing. By the last quarter of the race or so, the winner is usually already decided. That's not necessarily a bad thing, simply because that middle portion of the race is so interesting. Whatever it lacks in end game excitement it makes up with deeper, more strategic play overall.

Although there are quite a few games out there which feature similar game mechanics (race track movement) this one shines out. The game mechanic has been tweaked, you can crash into your opponents, you can go off course or you can turn your sled into a bunch of toothpicks if you wish. Very well made game by Asmodee, suitable for minors and/or newbies.

RATING: 8
After three games, I’ve stuck with my initial assessment of [i]Snow Tails[/i] as [i]Advanced Ave Caesar[/i]. The feel of the two games is similar as you need to use hand management to fuel movement this turn and prepare for future turns, whether you’re aiming to drift through a U-turn or approaching a speed limit that will damage your sled if you cross it too quickly. You can time passes in order to cut someone off and force them to hit you or go out of control. You can also be aware of which opponents have played which cards to give you a sense of what’s left in their deck and possibly already on deck in their hand.

Beyond those comparisons, [i]Snow Tails[/i] uses a more dynamic movement system that should reward more extensive play. Currently I feel like I’m still struggling to find the sweet paths through a course. In [i]Ave Caesar[/i], the good spots on the course are clear to everyone; the only question is whether you have the cards in hand to take advantage of them. In [i]Snow Tails[/i], you have more freedom to move and experiment, to push your dogs and sled and take damage and yet still keep moving. Damage can take you out of the game if it’s too severe, but you can also throw away future options (by clogging your hand with damage cards) to gain a positional advantage in the present; the ability to make those kinds of trade-offs is always welcome in a game.

RATING: 6
Nice production, but the use of a die or some other simple device to show the brake is a no-brainer. Only other "gripe" (not really) is that some puzzle cuts would have been nice on the boards to keep things in place.

Great race game, very inventive and has you actually sweating the turns; the risk/reward stuff is spot on.  Not sure I'm sold on the bonus movement method, but whatever.

What this game proved to me, finally, is that I don't like race games that much.  I don't think you could do it much better than this, and it's still just not quite there for me.

RATING: 8
fast and furious sled dog raceing utilising a clever little system to steer; the faster of a pair of 2 dogs pulls harder so ifn you ned to go left have a faster dog on teh left. 
The combined total of  2 dogs speed (maximum speed of 5 per dog) minus your brake number (maximum 5) is your total movement so ifn you had a 5 dog on the left and a 3 on the right with a 2 brake you woudl go 6 spaces 2 of which would have to be to teh left.
The fact that you must play at least 1 card a turn (you may play up to 3 identical though) and that you can not weave  in and out  in teh smae turn makes navigation  tricky and often quite hiliarious :)
A good fun game with pretty good theme (oh and cute lil woden trees :) )

I want to enjoy racing games, but I've found all of them to be boring or frustrating and sometimes both. Snow Tails is definitely not boring, in fact, I love the general idea of game play: select your dogs and turn based on how much power the left one has versus the right one, all compared to your brake strength. However, I have a big problem with the game: there's a runaway leader problem. When you're not in first place, your options drop due to where the people ahead of you are, sometimes having to waste an entire turn or, worse yet, earn a couple of dent cards and end up in a less-than-helpful spot. A lot of this could be inexperience, and I'm interested in playing again at some point, but I don't have high hopes for this one.

RATING: N/A
Family race game of programmed grid movement on modular track courses.  Unique card driven system to play power cards that brake the sled or change the speed output of either of your left or right sled dogs to drift into lanes, negotiate turns, avoid hazards and pour it on in the straight always.   Take damage cards when you wreck that slow your deck. Clever use of yellow and red flags on the course to orient which dog is which on the course.

RATING: 8
We all love this - it's a great race game that really feels like a race; simple mechanic of cards to manage brakes and dogs to move forward. 

One notable issue: in the vast majority of games, the leader at the halfway point is the winner: the catch up mechanic of doubling the speed of the dogs is rarely used due to the speed limit effect on the bends: almost needs house ruling that the speed increase brought about by the equal dogs is not affected by the speed limits.

RATING: 8
A clever card-driven racing game where frenzied dogs pull your sled onwards and upwards - often into a tree or wall.  Since players are forced to play one or more cards each turn to modify the sled brakes and/or strength of each dog, players are sometimes forced into a position where wall- and tree-smackery is unavoidable. But that just makes the game even more sadistic and enjoyable.

Update:

Rating increased to an 8 - assuming (as is proper) that as many tree and obstacle tiles as possible are being used.  Don't play on an obstacle-free track!

For me, Snow Tails is the perfect racing game: not too long, with just the right amount of luck and screwage. 

Now I can finally unload Formula De and Mississippi Queen.  Thank God.

Rating based on one play.

I went into this game thinking I would like it just okay, and I was completely right (go, self-consciousness!). It's a fairly simple racing game, and I'm not too much into that genre. You get five cards into your hand and have to decide your tactics based on that. I've noticed that I've started to enjoy games in which the main mechanic is based on the cards you receive to base your actions on less and less (except for deckbuilders and drafting games, because in those kind of games you pick what's added to your deck and what cards to keep/pass, respectively).

I haven't played too many race games per se so I don't have much to compare it too, [gameid=38531] being the only racing game I have played. However, there are a couple of cool if not novel mechanics that Snow Tails employs. The drift mechanic is incredibly neat. Playing dogs of different power to affect how your sled moves across the playing field as well as forward adds some neat tactical thinking. The "catch-up" mechanism is clever. One would think that if you were in the back of the pack you would always strive to balance your sled for this bonus movement. However, this is definitely not the case. Speed limits on curves are a big limiting factor. Crashing into others another. In addition, playing two cards to balance your sled may not always be the best move. Since you only have four cards of each number (once all are used they can be reshuffled), a wiser play may be to play one card with an unbalanced sled rather than slapping down two cards to balance the sled. Finally, I think the dent card idea is cool. It does make you think twice about taking extreme risks. One dent card is okay, my blue sled with one dent card finished second. I would think two may be doable, but more than that and you are going to be limited in your options. Control of your sled is going to be much more difficult.

After eighty days of waiting, my wife asked if the game was worth the wait. I answered that yes it was, but the price for admission is a little steep. Great bits, clever mechanics, superb theme, excellent game. If I have any drawbacks about the game it is the price. Maybe with the Asmodee reprint, the price will come down to allow more people the joy of playing this excellent game.

This is a fun racing game with some interesting card management and a press your luck feel around the corners and speed checks reminiscent of Formula D... but with more control thanks to those cards!  I had worried that the cards would end up making things feel too out of control but they were easier to manage than I thought they might be.  I understand this might be getting a new edition soon and if it looks good I could certainly see getting a copy.

Racing games are a dime a dozen to me.  Though I appreciate the realistic simulation in terms of the drifting mechanism, I felt it required a lot more work than I care to put in.  It was a serviceable way to spend 45 minutes but I didn't really have fun.  There isn't anything inherently bad with Snow Tails, but I guess it just completely failed to excite me.  Your mileage may vary.

Very cool racing game that suffers from pretty heavy downtime.  It grants the player both more and less control than [gameid=173]:  More control in that you apply cards from your hand to control the sled, rather than rolling a die.  In other words, when you make a decision, you pretty much know how it's going to play out.  Less control in that you can't steer willy nilly, so your choices must be much more predictive and strategic.

Neat racer, with quirky, mathy movement. Sometimes you have to slow way down to clear the bends, and possibly the saplings, but next turn you can instantly regain top speed!!!

The 5 card hand limit 'including the dents/damage that when acquired limit your effective hand size' is a neat idea, as is forcibly having to either Mush the dogs or brake 'every' single turn, which gives it a surprisingly quirky control mechanism.

Not quite as straightforward as Powerboats, but has more agonising decisions.

Too many turns on a course can slow the game down somewhat.

Aztlán astonished me with its very simple rules but deep strategic decisions. The game has elements from reading your opponents and guessing which cards they will play, but also includes some secret diplomacy part, where letting your ooponent live in the right moment might be advantages for you in a later stage of the game. In a four player game there might be some analysis paralysis with certain players, but the game plays usually under an hour. The art of the board is fantastic and having fully sculpted pawns is a plus, too.

Reasonably simple and clever majority game.  It is over-produced in some ways, but the graphic design is just okay.  The game does require you to "play" everyone else's turn as well in order to succeed; this isn't one of my favorite concepts and will limit me wanting to play this.  Nevertheless, the design is quite good.

RATING: 6
It has interesting and elegant mechanics, but all it can take is for people to gang up on you for one turn and you can be completely out of the game, which is almost worse than player elimination as you have to sit through it to the end.

RATING: 7.5
Game rather demanding where luck plays only a little part, mainly in drawing prosperity cards. Each play is different from others thanks to the many choices available to each player and the influence they have with those of opponents.
3-players game is quite different from a 4-players game but I'm not sure which is better: in 4-players game cards play a more important role than in 3-players game where on the other hand control of territory is the main way to collect VPs.

RATING: 8
Typically of Colovini, the rules of Aztlan are so slight that you wonder how much of a game could be in the box. It turns out that there is quite a brutal game of area control in there. There are several reasons why this one is brutal; the board is quite tight so that you are quickly in competition for space, even in the three-player game; the scoring system that rewards a large single area positively invites attempts to break them up; and there is also the way in which your high scoring terrain changes every turn, spurring expansion into different areas.  

A system that gives the victor in a conflict the choice of eliminating the enemy or co-existing adds interest.  The reward for choosing co-existence is a card that offers a v.p. bonus or some other benefit.  

Production quality is high and the artwork is evocative.

Initial impression is that this might be a Colovini gem. The bluffing and deduction are reminiscent of Clans. The two player rules work, but are, perhaps, a convoluted for a first play. I'm not entirely convinced about the prosperity cards; the concept - leave your enemy unbeaten, get a prize - is a good one, but the cards themselves may be a bit overpowered. Plus, they lead to a little euro point salad syndrome, taking the emphasis off the bluff/deduction aspect by watering down the scoring.

Leo Colovini returns with a game with bears his hallmark characteristics: extraordinarily simple rules and a devillish gameplay. Or so I though at first. And after mulling over the first game I played, I think I was at least partially correct. Colovini created a game which, rather surpringly, seems to borrow some ideas from venerable Go: you create an initial basic structure with [i]a lot[/i] of little guys, score these, and then as the game progresses, start to add more and more accents to that basic structure. This is rather analogous to the way you create a 'scaffolding' of sorts with a few dozen stones, and then proceed to strengthen it, or to jump from it. Of course in Go stones cannot move, while in Aztlán little guys can, but here another clever idea is introduced: you get to place and move less and less meeples. Coupled to this very strong idea there is the guessing game also found in Clans: deducing from what a player does, what card he played. This part of Aztlán is precisely what I expect Colovini to produce: brain-meltingly goodness.

But.

But indeed.

First there are these *(&)(&!&)^&*(^()!! cards which can totally ruin the subtle placement game because they enter the game at random and remain unknown to the other players until they are played out. Oh, you expected to win in that area? Think again, mate. Cool, I get to score my valuable province again, and I don't really care if you can make up the difference. So I'd only play again with these darned things open so that the players know what they are getting into. (At the same time there has to be some reward for letting people remain in one's province... But honestly, couldn't this be solved in a different way?)

Second, the (&#%U_%)Q%# artwork. Oh, it's gorgeous alright. If I could frame it I might be tempted, so well done Messrs. Baker and Gifford. But I purchase a game to [i]play[/i], not to stare in awe at it. I played the game with 4 players, and well into it there were so many meeples on the board that they totally obscured the already weak-on-contrast board areas with, adding insult to injury, irregular borders. This was truly plastic salad served on a platter of cardboard. I mentioned Go above: I am unpleasantly reminded of how [i]clear[/i] that ancient abstract is compared to the mess of Aztlán. Mr. Publisher: look at Clans to see how it is done. Large areas, small playing pieces, contrasting areas: simply a joy to play [i]physically[/i]. Now look at your photorealistic Mayan-lookalike, please? At what point did okay'ing the current design seem like a good idea?

Had either one of these problems not existed, I'd probably own a copy of the game right now—the core is that intruiging. But not when they're both present in one and the same box. This costs the game valuable points in my book to the point where I simply won't consider playing it anymore. That would earn it a '3', but I really can't make myself rate the game that low.

[b]Update[/b] And during the next Spiel, the game was already to be had for little in the dump stand of Heidelberger. A complete and utter flop, therefore. I can't say I'm surprised.

[b]Kinézet:[/b]
Gyönyörű nagy tábla, szép figurák, jó minőségű, szép grafikájú kártyák. A kivitelezés 10/10. Már-már indokolatlanul szép ahhoz képest, hogy alapvetően egy absztrakt területfoglalós játékról van szó. Egyetlen hátrány a kinézettel kapcsolatban: a tábla átláthatóságát feláldozták a design oltárán. Néhol nehéz megmondani elsőre, hogy mi-mivel határos, illetve nehéz megkülönböztetni bizonyos területtípusokat egymástól.

[b]A szabály:[/b]
Elég egyszerűek a szabályok, így nem volt annyira nehéz dolguk a szabállyal. Jól szerkesztett, színes-szagos, elsőre érthető. Egyetlen dolog merült csak fel játék közben, ami nem volt benne egyértelműen leírva. (Hogy mit kell tenni, ha elfogynak a kártyák. A fórumok alapján vissza kell keverni a dobottakat)

[b]A tematika:[/b]
A játék története szerint azték törzseket irányítunk, és versengünk az élettérért egymással. Ennek során természetesen konfliktusokba keveredünk a másikokkal, amiket megoldhatunk barátságosan - az istenek nagy örömére - vagy agresszíven - a másik játékos bánatára. :)
Mivel egy egyszerű, területfoglalós, dominanciaszerzős játékról van szó, így természetesen nem túl mély a tematika. Ezt ellensúlyozza talán a gyönyörű grafika mind a táblán mind a kártyákon.

[b]A játék menete:[/b]
A játék pofonegyszerű. 5 körünk van. Minden körben mindenki választ titkosan egy kártyát, ami két dolgot határoz meg: 
1. Az adott körben mely területtípusok fontosak nekünk, mi ér pontot
2. Az adott körben milyen erősek a figuráink.
A kiválasztott kártya a kör végéig titkos marad. A választás után történik a területfoglalás. Minden játékos letehet egy figurát és mozgathat egy lent lévőt. Egy kör addig tart, amíg mindenki le nem rakta az adott körre kapott összes figuráját. Körönként egyre kevesebből gazdálkodhatunk, viszont fent maradnak az addig felrakottak, így egyre fontosabb lesz a mozgatás is.
Ha mindenki letette a figuráit, jön a pontozás. Mindenki felcsapja a titkos kártyáját. Minden területen megvizsgáljuk, hogy kié a többség (katonák száma * kártyán lévő erősség). Aki a legerősebb két dolog közül dönthet:
1. Kiűzi az ellenfeleket, akik ezzel elhagyják a táblát.
2. Együttél az ellenfelekkel: jutalmul húzhat egy kártyát, amin mindenféle előnyök vannak (plusz bábu rakása, plusz pontok stb. )
Ha minden területet megvizsgáltunk, kiosztjuk a pontokat. Ennek nem írom le a pontos menetét, de lényeg az, hogy minél nagyobb egybefüggő területeket kell létrehoznunk, amin minél több olyan típusú terület van, ami az adott körben választott kártyánkon szerepel.
Jönnek az új katonák, jön az új kör.

[b]Interakció:[/b]
A fentiekből szerintem kiderül, hogy igen nagy, mondhatni szinte csak interakcióról szól a játék.

[b]Játékidő, játékosszám:[/b]
3-4 játékossal működik a játék, de van 2 személyes extra szabály is, amit még nem próbáltam. Játékidő egy óra körüli. Gyakorlottakkal szerintem 45 perc is lehet.

[b]Újrajátszhatóság:[/b]
Sok minden nincs a játékban, ami kifejezetten az újrajátszhatóságot segíteni, de mivel rengeteg az interakció, ezért minden játék teljesen más.

[b]Bonyolultság:[/b]
Pofonegyszerű játék, kb. "át a sivatagon" szintű szabályokkal. Bárkinek megtanítható.

[b]Szerencse:[/b]
Az együttélésnél húzott kártyáknál van némi szerencse szerep, nomeg a játék elején azonos kártyaválasztással bele lehet kerülni néhány kellemetlen szituációba. Amúgy azt mondanám, hogy nagyon alacsony.

[b]Összegzés:[/b]
Ajánlom azoknak akik szeretik a sakkszerű, absztrakt nagy interakciójú játékokat. Gyönyörű játék egyszerű szabályokkal, pörgős játékmenettel, ahol kritikus fontosságú a másik gondolatainak olvasása és megfelelő lereagálása.

I really enjoy this one. A lot of ways to play effectively. The interesting portion of the game is the opportunities for cooperation and defection. There is a decent amount of determining what each player is going for but it becomes quite clear usually quickly in the round. I think a lot of what is there can be easily overlooked and the game could be dismissed as a light area control game, but there is a lot more going on than just that area control.

I really enjoy Aztlan.  For me, it has the right mix of tough choices, tenseness and excitement, while at the same time being light on rules and easy to learn.  There is an edge of nastiness to it, but not too much as to be distasteful.  The conflict decisions are tough, as it is difficult to choose between eliminating an opponent or opting to coexist so you can acquire prosperity cards.  All of this combines to form a game that is enjoyable and continues to intrigue.  My only complaint is that it is difficult to keep track of which territories have been examined during the conflict phase.  We have found it helpful to lay a pawn on its side as each territory has been examined.  This makes it easier to spot those territories that still need to be assessed.  

Fortunately, this one problem is not a design flaw or even a major issue.  The game is good … quite good.  While I still have dozens of Essen releases to play, it seems destined to be one of the top games released at the show.

RATING: 7
A simple, abstract and very confrontational area control game with some hidden information and significant luck of the draw. There is total freedom in the placement of new warriors, and the winner of each conflict may choose to eliminate or spare the loser. Expectedly, that causes some chaos and a constant feeling of being at the mercy of other players' decisions, especially considering that it is really easy to gang up on someone. It is a good game, but I guess it will only shine with players of similar skill and understanding of its workings. The two-player game is very different and even more abstract with the (maybe necessary but still weird) rule of switching sides each round.

As a curiosity, "Aztlán" reminds me a little of the Brazilian "Jogo dos Conquistadores", which is a bit simpler but uses terrain cards to restrict placement - something that might have worked here.

Wow, Colovini's best work to date!

Mechanically simple, but nice tactical considerations to be made which relies on deduction and bluffing. The strategy revolve around deciding the order to play the cards and how to progress through the map in order to migrate to the right zones at the right time. The mechanic of letting people survive or not is great fun.

RATING: 6
This game rubbed me the wrong way being conflict-heavy but my rating of 6 gives it the benefit of doubt as a game out of my usual comfort zone. As usual for Colovini, few rules create comparably much depth. The unique idea is giving the winner of battles the option to choose life or death for opponent's pawns in exchange for prosperity cards which either grant special powers or additional VP's. The game won't be won without them but it won't be won either if other pawns always survive. My major complaint is that there's no way to recover once a player has fallen clearly behind in the number of pawns on the board. Mind you, after a scoring-wise weak second round I was able to win as I consistently had the most pawns on the board and spared my three highest power cards for the final rounds. I'm afraid that this could be a norm strategy for Aztlan.

Colvini at his best.  There are quite a few tight decisions contained in this box.

Note that the deck of reward cards IS NOT shuffled once it is exhausted.  This forces the endgame to become decidedly cutthroat.  And that's a good thing.

Typical Colovini-game, in the sense that Aztlan has simple rules but plenty of brain burning. Aztlan is also quite chaotic and the board could be a lot clearer (it's not the easiest task to defferentiate between different symbols, which often get hidden by the overly colorful plastic playing pieces), but the "kick your opponent out or keep him around and get a bonus card" -mechanism keeps things interesting.

Note: cards have German on them, but there are only like 6 different kinds so a very short crib sheet does the job.

Neat, albeit slightly dull area control game for the first couple of plays, in the [i]'I see, what you are doing there, I respect that, but let's just be friends'[/i] sense. But after you learn the board, and your opponents... It turns unexpectedly into a fierce and brainy game, full of deduction and deception. The simple system of five rounds with decreasing number of dudes to play and move, in strength determined by the one-use card, that serves as the scoring card for the round as well; it's just astonishing. Collecting cards as rewards for not killing weaker tribes gives it another twist, so for the low amount of game elements, you get a lot to think on.

My only quibble is that with even three, the board gets crowded fast, and sometimes it's hard to see what's going on, but for a game like this, I can live with it.

There are many intriguing aspects of Aztlán. Secretly chosen cards tell determine both strength and score. Units may initially be placed anywhere and later moved to adjacent regions. Weaker units may either be removed or spared in return of a potentially valuable card. This turns the game into a tactical affair with plenty of room for negotiations and backstabbing. However, I fear that all this may make the game too chaotic and limit the long-term strategic positioning of units. It's probably best with 3 equally skilled players that keep checking each rather than 4 players that always expect someone else to deal with the leader.

RATING: 8.1
Une seule partie jouée (à 4). J'affectionne les jeux de positionnement, et celui-ci ne m'a pas déçu. Je serais susceptible d'augmenter quelque peu la note (8.2) mais il faudrait que j'y rejoue. 

Les "Prosperity Cards" qu'ont obtenu mes adversaires en dernière ronde ont complètement modifié le score final: Le meneur après 4 rondes a terminé dernier (!); j'étais second après 4 rondes mais j'ai terminé 3e; le 3e joueur après 4 rondes a terminé 1er; et la joueuse qui a été la dernière durant les 4 premières rondes de la partie a terminé 2e! 

EDIT: Lors de ma deuxième partie (à trois joueurs contre deux néophytes), j'ai mené durant toute la partie mais j'ai terminé dernier. Les Prosperity Cards ont encore influencé dramatiquement le denouement. Malgré tout, j'aime la réflexion que me demande ce jeu (positionnement des troupes, choix du terrain vedette...). J'enlève -0.1 à ma note initiale et lui confère donc un "8.1", qui demeure bien au-dessus de l'évaluation générale.

note: mes deux parties ont duré entre 120 et 180 minutes. Le jeu peut plaire aux joueurs qui aiment réfléchir et calculer différentes possibilités stratégiques. Mais il faut accepter l'élément "hasard" bien présent dans le jeu, et pouvant altérer le résultat final.

[u][BGCOLOR=#ccccff]Variante[/u][/bgcolor]: Je propose cette variante afin de donner un peu plus de force à la carte que je considère être la plus faible (Great Tlatoani), et afin que chaque tribu débute avec deux "caractéristiques initiales". Celles-ci peuvent donner un peu plus de profondeur ou guider un peu plus les joueurs dans les premiers tours de la partie.  

A) Modification de Great Tlatoani: Donne +1 à un territoire. L'idée initiale (permettre de gagner au bri d'égalité un combat nul) demeure, mais permet aussi de modifier une défaite par 1 point en combat nul.

B) Impossible de se défaire de cartes Offerings to the Gods superflues. À la fin de la partie, chaque carte Offerings to the Gods excédant la 5e fait perdre 2 points à son propriétaire (au lieu de gagner 1 point). Un joueur avec 6 Offerings to the Gods récolte donc 23 points au lieu de 26.

- À quatre joueurs:

1) Mélanger les huit cartes Faveur des Dieux suivantes, et en remettre deux à chaque joueur au début de la partie: 3x1 Blessing of the God de chaque sorte; 1 Great Tlatoani; 1 Sacred Games; 1 Eagle and Jaguar Warriors; 1 Rafts and Canoes; 1 Offerings to the Gods.

2) Mettre de côté 3 cartes Offering to the Gods.

3) Le reste des cartes constitue la pile à piger.

À chaque fois qu'un joueur jouera l'une des deux cartes reçues au début de la partie, il devra immédiatement l'ajouter à la pile de cartes à piger (et non pas dans la défausse), puis brasser celle-ci. 

Les trois premières fois de la partie où un joueur joue une carte Faveur des Dieux, il doit prendre l'une des cartes Offering to the Gods mise de côté au début de la partie, l'ajouter à la pile de cartes à piger, puis brasser celle-ci.

- À trois joueurs: 

Procéder de la même manière. Retirer les mêmes huit cartes; en remettre deux à chaque joueurs. Seule différence: Immédiatement brasser les deux cartes restantes dans la pile de cartes à piger.

The game holds promise on the rules reading, feeling like a cross between Evo and Smallworld but without the auctions and powers. And then the hitting and the king-making starts from the second round on and you realise that it's a lot more vicious. The go-where-ever-you-want nature of the map means anything is take-able, resulting in a whine-fest game arguing who to hit, and ends up less fun that you'd expect - just way too many disagreements on who should be hit and what meeples must die or should be allowed to let live during the scoring - as in, "I'm not the leader!". The secret nature of what territory type people are going for this round reveals itself as each round progresses, so it's pretty obvious what to target to break up the perceived leader's contiguity, which is a crucial component of scoring, especially if that spot helps yourself as well. I liked the "let them live and get VPs from cards instead" aspect, and it mostly worked ... except when it didn't. Getting fewer troops each round was also interesting, but it does make for more viciousness early on to stop meeples scoring multiple rounds onwards. There were lots of likeable bits, but I wasn't a fan of the whole - of how no one came out of the game thinking that was fun, let's do it again.

RATING: 8.5
Tight area control with a twist. Do you defeat and banish your enemies from Aztlan or share territory and gain favors from the Gods? An enjoyable middleweight game. Excellent components and art work. My favorite Colovini to date.

Area control and hidden bidding (for VP/winning battles), done well and boringly. Nothing wrong with the game, but won't likely play it again. Maybe it's just me, but these mesoamerica-themed games don't work for me at all. I can't see how the theme is responsible, but..

I'm a fan of Colovini's earlier designs like Carolus Magnus and Clans, and despite some superficial similarities to the latter, Aztlan is a stinker.  The board is very busy and it's hard to visualize regions and how they're connected, the rules are unclear at several points, the scoring system is fiddly and involves counting all your regions and squaring  a subset of them, and it's got a runaway leader problem where winning early battles lets you clean out enemies and not have to fight them again, so recovering from an early-mid game blowout round is impossible.

這遊戲有一陣子在市面上經常看到，不過不知為什麼一直沒有受到大家的注意。
個人感覺這遊戲算是屬於遺失的寶石一類的遊戲吧（一起玩遊戲的臺灣埃摩工作室特派工作人員Key似乎也很喜歡這款遊戲）。
首先，遊戲的美工很贊，無論是封面還是版圖，感覺特別有味道。遊戲配件做工精良，數量眾多。
最值得稱道的就是遊戲機制，這機制其實一點也不複雜，就是個區域控制遊戲，光看規則平淡無奇，但是很快就能上手，玩一把的話，就是會覺得很好玩，時間一下子就過去了，就是那麼簡單。

It's basically a multiplayer abstract, but it definitely scratched an interesting itch on my side.
The rules are simple and streamlined and so is the gameplay which is kept short.
Great game!

[person=138][/person] is not my favorite designer. He has some games that I appreciate, but none that I love. This game combines some classic Colovini ingredients with great artwork. But the game play is not something that I enjoyed. The constant pushing and pulling for positions on the board. And it seemed like there was quite a bit of kingmaker going on as well, but I'd have to play more to be sure.
In any case, if the best thing about the game is the box cover, than something is wrong.

Initial rating: 5.5

Light and quick.  Not a lot of rules, but some interesting decisions to make.  3-Player had a good amount of conflict between two players, while another player stayed largely away from others.  Want to play again with 4.  Pleasantly surprised with this one.

I only tried the prototype so this may be subject to changes.
It's an area control game with a lot of direct interaction, and this screamed "not my cup of tea" (actually that's true for all Leo's games, just like I am sure my games aren't his cup of tea at all).
You can be mean to other players, you can gang up against a player and negate him a fair chance to win, and it's really abstract (but unlike other people I don't have issues with abstract games).
In its own category, however, it's a very good game. 
The simultaneous action choice brings to interesting turn scenarios, and will give you the "gotcha!" feeling if you correctly guessed other players choices (a bit like Race for the Galaxy). The combat and scoring mechanichs, altough not revolutionary, are clever and do work really well and smoothly.
The quality of artwork and miniatures is outstanding, and it earns the game at least half a vote extra.
I would reccomend Aztlàn strongly to Small World players and, if you enjoy direct interaction and you don't mind a degree of abstractness, you'll come to love Aztlàn.

(After 1 4p game at GenCon) - I tend to like Colvini games and I like this one.   Our game was very much a "remove other opponents" pieces game and we neglected the cards until late.   The penalty for losing is to remove all your pieces from that region and that just seemed very harsh, but that could be the Euro-gamer in me talking.

Area control, special cards, terrain bonuses - theme is pasted on, BUT it works fine.

The concept is intriguing, but in practice it just didn't come together. Partly this was due to horrendous downtime that I expect could be minimized with less AP prone players and repeated plays. However, I also wasn't convinced by the coexist option, as it seemingly leads to mostly obvious decisions. I'd like to give Aztlan another spin though; it just might all come together with brisk and thoughtful players at the table. Alternatively, it might just suck.

It's kind of bonkers how good this game is. The rules are laughably simple. On your turn, place a piece, then move a piece. That's it. I was almost angry when I saw how simplistic the game was because it is an absolutely gorgeous production and I wanted it to be as good as it looked.

Much to my surprise, in practice, the game is incredibly engaging. Loads of bluffing and misdirection, enough known information to keep you from flying in the dark, yet just enough mystery to make every move a gamble. It is the most basic of area control games, but it is layered with a very simple hand management card game. Players all have identical hands of scoring cards, but which card each player is trying to score is decided in secret before the round begins. It's brilliant and turns what should be a very boring counting exercise into a complete bluff-o-rama.

It is really hard for me to justify telling anyone to pay $50 bucks for a ruleset this light, but I'd be lying if I said the game wasn't quite good for what it is. Hopefully, everyone can find it on sale and save me trying to do so!

Maybe, and i say maybe, this is the best game tried in Essen 2012 (togheter with Qin).
Extremely simple rules, clean, elegant, fast, evil but with this great thing that is "being merciful" . I could play 3 games of this in a row. 
great game, one of those that "I'd like to had invented it".

[EDIT]: after a complete 4 players game I have some perplexities. The mechanism is always good and interesting but we were so merciful that we ended without cards and in the last Era being merciful was usless and meaningless. that's a strange finale. Rating lowered .7 points.

[EDIT]: this time 4 mean players and the experience was back to very good, all ended in a bunch of points aafter a tense game. My rating for Aztlan is waving back and forth.

Area control placing workers on different terrain trying to maximize objective points.  Cards are used to resolve conflicts in occupied terrain where coexisting is an option. Special cards used to mix things up. Place and move workers, resolve points and conflicts. Card counting and bluffing possibilities. Fairly abstract. Beautiful artwork and good components. The plastic warriors are meh.

The mechanisms in this game have elegant and/or calculated balances to them, which are a pleasure to watch work.  One "imbalance" of it, however, is that it depends a bit on the players beating each other up similarly over the course of the game.  That isn't much to my tastes, but there is plenty of good in the game.  If that wouldn't bother you, this game is surely a win for you!

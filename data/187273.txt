I LOVE the book series and HAD to back the KickStarter. HAD to. It was the law.  I enjoy the coop nature of the game, having special abilities for the characters.  We've played a few times with 2 players (covering 2 chars each), and would really like to try it at a higher player count to get a better feel for the capabilities of the game.  

Dat Thomas, tho.  *hawt.

A variable cooperative puzzle in which obstacles, foes, clues and advantages from a story deck are dealt into two rows of six and need to be dealt with in a certain order.  Each player takes a character deck with different strengths and deals themself a hand of cards that may be as few as four in a five player game.  These may be the only cards you ever see.  Playing cards requires a variable number of fate points to be spent from a common pool.  Cards can be discarded to return spent fate to the pool.   Well, it works and it's over quickly, but there doesn't seem to be a great deal to think about, particularly with higher player numbers and smaller hands of cards.

The card art is decent.  The board is boring but functional.  Production quality is good.

Nice thematic co-op. It's very puzzley. I actually really enjoy that once you set it up... that's it. There's no random change or updates (like epidemic cards from Pandemic) - it's how best to solve the puzzle in front of you. Theme does come out in the way the cards interact.

I think I have two real complaints about this game.

First, I really wish there was more variety in art.  Looking at the Side Jobs deck, for instance, EVERY Foe has the same art, EVERY Obstacle has the same art, etc etc etc.  You'll find the art is reused about as much as possible.  I understand that this was probably necessary to keep the cost of the game reasonable (art is expensive!) but too often the art doesn't match the card title, and that really takes away from the theme of the game.

Second... I really don't think this game captures the source theme very well.  I LOVE that I can play as a variety of different characters from the Dresden novels.  However, they really don't seem to play that much different.  And the differences mechanically feel so shallow that I don't feel like I'm playing a Dresden Files game, I'm just playing a card game.  The progression of the game itself follows story from a particular book in some ways, but again, it really doesn't feel like I'm playing in the Dresden Files world, I'm just putting tokens on cards in a certain order.

Aside from this- the game plays smoothly, and quickly.  It's not a bad game by any means, but I really wish it felt like the theme was more than something pasted on.

Ended up giving it to Mark.

This game is a lot of fun! Backed it on kickstarter and very glad I did! My entire game group liked it, even though we lost both times. This game is HARD to beat. If that's not your thing, maybe give it a miss.

The only thing I will say is that the theme seems pasted on. It could literally be anything. Doesn't have to be Harry Dresden. There's not really much to it thematically.

Still a freaking great game though, regardless of this!

Fabulous Game. I sleeved with Ultra Pro Standard Profit 64 mm x 89 mm great fit. The Ultra Pro Deck Protector Sleeves Standard 66mm x 91mm are a tad too wide for storage as are Fantasy Flight Clear Standard (although labeled 63.5 x 88mm they seem more 65 x 90). Still looking for Sleeves for Dividers... ;-)

Context:
At first, the theme drew me in. A co-operative game, set in a universe we enjoy? Fine, I'll take a chance. I wasn't too sold on the gameplay from the video but it looked fine and would need to be played to see how it shakes down.

Now?
Well, it's a really compelling puzzle where you really must make the most of the advantages and abilities you have to hand. The dice do add some luck, but really, luck of the draw is a much bigger issue. A misused card or badly timed use of an advantage can mean the difference between victory or failure. The scenarios are all based on books from the series and they all have individual tweaks and the variable ordering means you have to face each puzzle with a fresh plan. I didn't think I'd be playing this one solo as much as I have been but the quick setup time and interesting puzzle aspect has meant I've played it most nights before bed.

RATING: 4
My least favorite kind of co-op game... where the group just talks and determines the best decision (or its quarterbacked by the player who knows the most).  I know nothing of the theme, but overall the graphic design & art were cool.  It's kind of a neat idea, that there is a set puzzle, and you have to use 1 ability + 5 cards to solve it from each player, but I just don't think there are many decisions to make that are interesting.  Also, I think this game is too easy, and they covered it by just adding a "End Score" to make it repayable.   Too much hype to for a game that I think people like just because of the theme.

Definitely enjoyed this. Very puzzle-ish, and really enforces the need for teamwork. We played with open hands and full discussion, as we don't care about the time requirements, and honestly enjoy that part best about co-operative games. Found the game itself more light gameplay wise, but overall it's a fairly tough challenge. Really exited for the amount of variation and replayability offered here, between using different characters with each book, varying the books itself by adding side jobs, or making completely random books with the side jobs alone. All in all, really pleased with this game, it's quite different from the others we've played and own. I'd recommend it, both for fans of the books and not. And if you haven't read them, get thee to a library immediately!

This game is excellently themed, very fun to play and super quick. More importantly the challenge is high. Ive played it on easy twice and won so now I have to move up to the standard game but something tells me it's going to get harsh very quickly!

Barrier to entry is low, thematically you will get more out of the characters if you are familiar with the books by Jim Butcher but it still wouldn't stop new people from playing.

I highly recommend this game and extremely happy that I kickstarted it.

Played the PnP copy a friend got via Kickstarter.

First off, I tend not to enjoy pure co-ops so much.  But this was just boring.  Sure you had to make decisions, but they were somewhat obvious after a little table talk among the players.  ("Don't bother working on that case, I've got it.")  

The theme was pasted on.

Perhaps if you're a fan of the books this will appeal to you, but I still suspect it would have a limited lifespan, as it gets boring rather quickly.

Kickstarted this game because I love the Dresden Files. Was not disappointed as this is a really fun game. Played last night with my group. We played 3 games with 5 people and we won all 3! We did not want to stop playing. Everyone loved it. So a solid 10 for me and my group. Even my wife who hates co-op games loved it. I do wonder if it is harder with less people as a lot of reviews found it hard to win. Maybe we were lucky or maybe it is easier with 5 people? That still doesn't change my rating though. *10*

I really like the books. I did enjoy this game the first plays. Short playtime and interesting choices. And then the theme! Well, actually, I realised I hardly recognised the stories during play and wasn't very much immersed in the events. Every game turns out to be a puzzle, which can be fun, but I miss the Dresen Vibe. Variations of the expansions turned out to be more puzzles, that have a samey feel over them. 
Probably great for people that enjoy cardgames, combo's and optimizing the details each play. Alas, not for me.

Literally the first hobby game I ever purchased. I love this game's theme and even the implementation of it (except for the dice), but I am not a fan of Co-ops in general. It's fun for a Sunday afternoon with family, but not what I want to pull out on game night. Fulfills its purpose of adding more Dresden to my life.

An interesting game that feels like a big puzzle. I love that it feels very different from other adventure card games. The teamwork is important and it is interesting how the cards interact with each other.

Really shines as a solo game in my opinion. It's fun to puzzle it out on your own, the few card draws and dice rolls add just enough uncertainty to add excitement. The game feels really well balanced, even the Side Jobs work great.

Cooperative card game based on the Dresden Files series.  It is not a deck-builder, but instead each character has a deck of 10 cards, a talent and a stunt.  Depending on the number of players, you get a set number of cards and collectively, you win by solving more  cases than surviving foes, which leads to some interesting tactical choices.   Since not all cards are in every game, players can only discuss possibilities without detailing out exactly what cards they have.  You pay fate points to play cards but it is a very limited pool which can only be refreshed by discarding cards.  Mechanisms are solid and theme comes through well as a fan of the series.

Solo variant is tough and focuses even more on the puzzle as all cards are revealed.

RATING: 4
Really not much of a game here. You have cards to make other cards on the board go away, but you rarely (if ever) draw more, and you are limited to what you can discuss with other players. I'm oversimplifying, but that's the gist of it. "Solving the puzzle" was neither interesting nor rewarding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice fast playing cooperative game. The randomness of layout adds replayability, but at the cost of allowing the difficulty to swing wildly. The speed of play makes this not matter as much as it otherwise would.

It probably plays best with 2 or 3, but it scales pretty well all the way to 5. It also has a table footprint that is not that large.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun little game! I'm a big fan of the novels, and the decks evoke their theme pretty well.
I'm not 100% on the balance... it seems like it is categorically better to draw big numbers rather than small numbers in the game, since you can discard them for more fate.
But besides that, I like the puzzle-based gameplay, the character variety, and the showdown ending. A nice design.

KS copy with two additional playable character decks (Mouse and Ra), alternate Susan and Harry cards, and Side Jobs hat card. Have Broken Token insert for game box.

A surprisingly swift game to play due to its use of the books to break down games into small and easily manageable chunks. Playing with two players means playing two characters each and then combining their draw piles, making each player turn very strategic.

We wound up playing a number of rounds while swapping out characters, and we were both very happy with how the theme felt natural within the mechanics (and since we are huge Dresden Files fans in this house, that was very important).

4/27/16: An extremely thematic co-op that scratches all the right itches in what I like about co-op, tight puzzle type games. There is high tension, management on multiple levels, great use of theme, smooth gameplay, and a nail biter. I love the Dresden Files series, and I'm that much more enamored with this game. I love the smart, yet quick gameplay, and get to play all the great characters I love in the books. With more game plays, my rating will only go up. Currently a 9, I will definitely see it at a 10 soon I believe. An excellent, quick game, that is dripping with theme, and oozes fun every time.

5/19/16: Changing my rating to a 10! Having the expansions available and the extra characters really amped this up for me. Can't wait till the full copy from the Kickstarter comes in. An amazingly thematic puzzle each and every time. Evil Hat knocked this one out of the park.

Played a couple of games on a PnP version.
It's a nice, tight fairly short co-op game that will spark a lot of discussion. 
Unfortunately the game system has very limited replayability.

Each scenario is a mini-puzzle with a randomized layout, but the desired order in which to "defeat" the cards are pretty obvious. Inability to follow that order will probably lose you the game.
Just looking through the base set scenarios, it doesn't seem like there is much variation between the scenarios either.

Also, the character variation is pretty limited. All characters basically have the same set of cards with a few variations in special abilities, card special effects and card numerical values. Not enough to make the characters feel different.

RATING: 7
Cooperative game where the players take control of one character of the world of Dresden and have to think together, and think very hard, in order to have success in the mission. I have played this game 4 times and I think that it is very interesting. There are some mechanics, even if not new, that have been mixed very well and the result of the game is one that provides level of difficulty that gives satisfaction when the mission is beaten and you have the feeling that you may had done something different when you lose.
I do really like the combination between cards, regular abilities and one-in-a-game ability of every player. There are some combos between characters that are more powerful than others but, in the end, you should try whichever combination. The doubt that I have with this game, that I will continue to have while I haven't played that many games, is if there are missions that are completely impossible or if there is always a chance of beaten the board. My first impression is that there are some cases in which it doesn't matter what you do, you are going to lose. But as I have said, I am not completely sure about this as I have not played that many rounds. Anyway, a great advantage of the game is that, it is so fast, that it really doesn't matter that much, yes, we could have won, yeah, but, why don't we set another mission and try again?
Positive:
1. The mechanics flow very smoothly
2. The combination between the abilities of the different characters work very well
3. Real feeling of satisfaction when beaten a mission
4. The duration of the game is appropriate for not getting bored
Negative:
1. I think that there are missions that are impossible no matter what
2. Not recommended for players that do not like great mental efforts

Players are characters from the book series who must use the limited cards they have to solve cases and defeat the bad guys -- but only if they have the right amount of fate. It's designed to be quick play, with some variation in characters and cards.

MINUS: not as much emphasis on theme or story as could be

For some reason I thought this was a deck building game, I was quite surprised to find it wasn’t. It is a co-op game but one where you only play a handful of cards, depending on the number of players. It also plays really quickly. 15 to 20 minutes for the whole game. It’s pretty tough I have only managed one win in the first four games.

Decent little coop game. Graphic design ended up better than I expected from the KS page.
That being said, I don't really like these dry, multiplayer puzzles where you aren't allowed to share concrete information.

The game has good artwork, but a rather limited amount of it. I get it, art's expensive. But Legendary raised expectations.
You get a hand of cards and that's basically it for the rest of the game. Yes, barring some other effects. Hence my liking of the Mouse deck for example.
It's very thematic and will perhaps result in a couple of Dresden fans getting to enjoy the bigger boardgaming hobby. But the cards are chock-full insider jokes. Haven't read the books? Enjoy your dry abstract. The cards aren't funny on their own. Again, seperate artwork would've helped here.
The graphic design is clean. Well done. Board's graphic design is a pretty ugly mess though.
It plays quite fast. But this is achieved through giving everyone very few turns with too much downtime in between.
And lastly, luck is too prevalent.

Very puzzly, but very fun as well. The books are well integrated - the different characters have very distinct playstyles. The first book is well portrayed - the dependencies of the different obstacles make sense in the context of the story.

I would recommend it to fans of the Dresden Files books and/or to people who enjoy puzzly card games. I happen to be in both categories.

Very impressive.  Enjoyed the book-based challenges and the different decks for each character.  It's helpful to have all of the expansions (1, 2, and 3) since the expanded character sets gives the game more variety.  It plays quick and managing the fate points creates an interesting puzzle.  The artwork could be a little more varied and the card quality a little better.  Otherwise, it's a fantastic game.

An ok game. Can be difficult and you must work together in order to win the game. There is no exception to this but it is an co operative game. The theme is interesting but not enough depth for my liking. All in all not a bad game, just not for me.

Feels like a stripped down Legendary, of which I am not really a fan, though this game I enjoyed very much. Familiarity with the books helped with that. It's a fun puzzler that I am sure will hit the table often for the two of us (love the quick setup and teardown time), but it is expensive for what is in the box. You are paying for the artwork and license here, I think. I backed through Kickstarter for upwards of $70 as a gift to my wife; I would not have paid more than $35-40 for an original theme for the same amount of content.

What an elegant game. Their is a ton of depth hidden in the simple card play. The mechanics are easy to teach with only a few card types, but thrn you can start peeling back the layers of each character. They definitely play different and I'm already thinking about the different combos I can throw at the cases.  A lot of replayablity in the base box but like sentinels of the multiverse if you add in an exspansion or two your options explode.

RATING: 8
Great for any fan of the Dresden Files books. Game play is a little frustrating at times as you have to rely on the hand you are dealt and does not feel like you have much control at times.  I think the idea is to try and replicate the "against the odds" feel of the books however the game does become pre-defined by the cards you get and are limited to and there are very few ways to change this feeling like you have little control to change the game no matter how well you play.

Kickstarter.

Review based on PNP.

Simple rules with tense tactical decisions.  Plays in under 30 min and has a lot of highly thematic ties to the Dresden novels.  Everything from deck compositions to the card names are thematically consistent and immersive.  Since card draws are rare, you end up making the best of what you have.  As a result, the game makes you sacrifice everything you have, setting up for one final last ditch showdown.  So. Very. Dresden.

Replayability is great with each character and book deck feeling quite different.  Base + Expansions include 11 characters + 11 decks.

The only downfalls are the relatively abstract combat/investigation (which can feel the same at times) and the light weight of the game.  While great for teaching gateway gamers, we've grown more used to medium-heavy Euro's.

I played [b]all[/b] my plays up to this point on the prerelease PnP copy that I made during the KS project. I haven't managed to get it to the table since! Partly that's because it really doesn't play at all well at 5 players IMO - and I have a 5-player group.

It's a very interesting game in the way that you are dealt your hand of cards up front and from that point on it's just a puzzle-solving exercise - except that the rules constrain communication to prevent both solving the puzzle and "quarterbacking". I really like it, the theme is OK, not super-strong, especially if the players haven't read the books (and I'm not sure whether anyone that hadn't read the books would buy the game).

So simple yet surprisingly thematic. Initially, it seems like you're just playing cards that match the colour of the ones on the board, but after you fail a few times it's easier to see the story coming though, especially if you pay attention to the card text and pictures. I've lost count of the number of times Harry's tried to leap over the Blue Beetle only to fall flat on his face!

Not a huge Dresden fan, although I've read several of the books. 

So I was surprised I enjoyed this game so much. Very good cooperative game. Each game is like a puzzle you have to figure out the best moves to complete. Just the right amount of luck thrown in with judicious use of dice. 

Varying scenarios and character decks add to replayability. Games clock in at around half an hour or so.

Played: 10-12 times.

I am not disappointed.  Thank you Evil Hat!  It's a quick, almost completely open info game (player hands are closed), similar to Legendary and the like, and set in the Dresden universe.  I am a Dresden fan and so the theme is awesome for me.  My wife knows little about the series, but she still enjoyed the gameplay. It appeared to be a no-brainer as far as Kickstarting it went, but I was still a little worried.  I'm no longer worried and look forward to rediscovering the stories I've not read for quite some time.  (Oh and for any future expansions!)

I demo'd the game last night from the publisher, and it was really good.
It was quick to learn and play, and had a strong theme.
There was a lot of challenge, and the game felt like it was on the edge of winning each time.  
I played it three times (two three player games and one five player game), and we lost once.
I'm so excited for this game, I'm not certain I can wait.  I may have to build the "print and play"--which I've only done once before.

Okay, here is the thing. I've never even heard of the Dresden files so this game was themeless. Some of the mechanics were a bit finicky to me, but if you can play this co-op in 20 minutes it isn't bad. For a twenty minute game, I could do it. If this game took 30-40 minutes, it would out stay its welcome by a lot. It's a decent 15-20 minute filler co-op, but a terrible 30-40 minute co-op. That's why it gets a 6.5. I would play this if I was at a game night and people already knew what they were doing so it didn't take all day. For those who like the book then they would probably like this one a bit more.

RATING: 8
I've only played solo so far, so bear that in mind.

This is a puzzle-y hand management game, and I think I'm really going to like it.  The variety in the setup (each character only draws about 2/3 of their deck and those are the cards they get for the entire game, with additional card draws being somewhat rare) leads to heart rending choices and a desire to play again to see the cards you didn't play with this time.

I will say, the game can be rather swing-y.  Choosing whether to play your massive 5 fate cost uber-card or discard it to add 5 fate isn't a simple choice with straight forward consequences.  It can be the difference between running out of fate (and triggering the end of the game), but doing some impressive board control, or powering up several smaller abilities for the next few turns and making the game run longer.  The game run time isn't much of a concern as the game only takes about 30 minutes to play, but that 30 minutes is made up of some head-conflagration causing logistical puzzles.

I've only played it once and lost rather badly, but I definitely want to play more.  I feel like I'm right on the verge of grasping this tactical, logistical puzzle presented in this game.

Like many people, we picked this up from Kickstarter. I must admit that it was my girlfriend's choice. Since I knew nothing about the books or universe - I was pretty "meh" about the idea of getting it (we have so many games, I only go for games that "wow" me now). However, I went into it with an open mind and here are my thoughts. Also to note, most games we play 2 player (including all times we've played this) - this game advertises as being for 1-5 players.

First impressions - box and components quite are quite good. There's room for more expansions in the box. This is great in a couple of ways. One, it shows that the developers know that us players like to have expansions nicely stored. And two, the developers are passionate about the game to want to plan for expansions! All the artwork looks nice, card quality is decent - so no complaints about the production quality at all.

The gameplay is pretty simple. You have 4 types of card, each deals with a different "enemy" card on the field. So "attacks" target "foes", "take advantage" targets "advantage", "overcome" targets "obstacles" and "investigate" targets "cases". Simple enough and these mechanics are solid and work well. But in a way, it oversimplifies the game. It really removes a lot of decisions from the player. I have "this" type of card, I need to use it against one of "those" cards on the field. If I can't use "my" card, the only thing I can do is discard it - so other people can use "their" cards. Since drawing new cards from your deck really doesn't happen often, what you have in your initial hand is pretty much what you'll be playing with. While we did have some decisions to co-ordinate when playing with 2 players (where we both have 9 cards each and 2 stunts), I can only imagine this game would get a little bit duller with more players. With 5 players, I'd only have 4 cards to play in the entire game. While it is good that the game length would stay around 30-40 minutes with more players, I can only imagine that the game wouldn't be as much fun as an individual would have very little to do in the game. On the other hand - no matter how many players, though, you do need to communicate work closely with other players in order to win. That is a good thing.

I also have an issue with the immersion side, if you have 1 or 2 players (which this game is advertised as). In order to get behind the theme of a game, you should be able to identify with your character. But I wasn't "Harry Dresden" here, I was "Harry Dresden, oh and Mouse as well". Now I'm not thinking about playing my character, I'm just thinking about my first character will do this to help setup my second character for his turn. "Needing" to play 2 separate characters, in a thematic game like this, is a little bit of a letdown for me.

Overall, I don't think this is a bad game but I don't think it's a good game either. It's certainly not an exciting game, more of a maths problem to be solved. The theme seems a bit tacked on, for me. Then again, I don't follow the books. I love the theme of Firefly and I've heard the same accusation of "tacked on theme" there, which I really disagree with. So I think that this game would appeal better to people who follow the books.

I'd probably play this again if asked, but don't think it's one that I'd suggest playing. So, given the BGG rating system - I slot this in as a 6/10

RATING: 7.4
I love co-op games and this one runs right up my alley. The game itself can be a bit frustrating and beating a mission can really rely on the opening layout and cards dealt. Still, I do enjoy working out the problems and trying to be each scenario. While it may seem a bit odd at first, it really does run fast once you get the hang of it.

RATING: 9
Loved the books. The game maintains the atmosphere fairly well I think. I could use a few nuances to improve that atmosphere, like perhaps a brief story summary for each mission, and more specific artwork, but I appreciate the cost of creating that much artwork would make the game cost much more.

As for the playability of the game, it was fast to pick up and run with, and definitely has the replayability that a coop game should have. Speaking of the cooperative nature, it is quite strong in that regard in that all players have to participate if you want to win. I look forward to trying more of the stories, and will likely get the expansion packs.

having read the books, i HAD to back this ks. although, having read the books, i was not a fan of the art (that's not my harry/thomas/etc!!). having played the game... oh, well, i guess the art is alright. the graphic design works well, anyway, and each round is a puzzle that doesn't overstay it's welcome. some people find it to be very difficult, although my groups have never had all that much trouble. you just have to sleuth more greens than there are leftover reds, right? the many, many different book layouts and many, many different characters can change the difficulty of that balance, of course. my sunday group asks to play, and i do think the game deserves to hit the table more, but i'm just so bored of nothing but cooperative games all day. having said that, despite currently purging my shelf of so many unplayed games, this particular game is safe. it's fun, interesting, and full of replayability. also, i have to keep it just on the chance they release a Hanabi-style expansion where you replay everything without seeing your own hand of cards. ooh, i can imagine it!

I've been playing this game since its early playtest days and I'm also a big fan of the Dresden books so take what I say with a grain of salt. 

This is cool co-op that has some innovative features that really contribute to it being a game about working together. The theming is also superb. I love the individual characters, and find the book theming to be good too (though you can lose that if you don't pay attention to what the cards say). 

I backed it on Kickstarter, and I've continued to play prototypes since, and I've discovered I like the game more I play it. I'm looking forward to playing through the whole arc of books once I have my own copy of this game.

The game is fairly simple to comprehend, but after 2 plays we felt that we were mostly arguing about what to do. It feels that the abilities of each character get in the way of other characters, which makes for a clanky gameplay and not a very fun experience (winning or losing).

Surprisingly puzzle-y.  I would think you would get more out of it once the decks are known better and you can determine whether it is worth it to sacrifice to get new cards.  For this reason and others, there is a tendency to alpha leader syndrome but I personally didn't mind this much

RATING: 6
A light and quick cooperative card game.  The game is themed after the novels by the same name.  Each player picks a character from the books, each character has a passive ability, a once-per-game ability, and a unique deck of cards.  This is a very tight card game, you draw a certain number of cards at the beginning and except for special powers and abilities you never draw more.  On your turn you need to do something, whether playing a card, discarding one to get more action points back, or passing but passing uses up not only a turn but an action point.

The gameplay is centered around 4 different types of challenges and cards that combat those specific challenges.  The difficulty in this game is not well designed in my opinion.  It is based entirely off of random setup of the mission you are playing and the cards people draw first since there is no convenient way to draw more or exchange cards.  So sometimes the cards in your hand and the cards in range on the board (there is a range to most cards) will match up but sometimes they really, really don't and the game is toast right from the start.  This is the main thing that turned me off to the game.

The art is fine.  It looks professional but nothing that really grabs my attention.  I suppose there is a little more interest to be had if you are familiar and a fan of the material.  That's not me.

A little too lightweight for my tastes... a simple coop game is appreciated and some of the mechanics are interesting, but they're so lightweight it doesn't really do enough for me. As a fan of the books, I'd have appreciated a little more complexity to bring the theme out more... as it is, it doesn't really feel like I'm solving mysteries and battling the supernatural. Instead it just feels like I'm doing resource management.

My kickstarter arrived today!  I managed to win (on easy) but just barely.  Very tight game.  Perfect for school nights.  Looking forward to making my way through the books.

This game is so much fun.  It's a puzzle-style co-op with a great use of Fate dice to mix things up.

The speed of this game is really what saves it for me.  The theme is barely there, really any theme could be placed on this and it would operate in relatively the same way.  But as I stated the speed makes this one a good buy for me.  Its a very quick, cooperative, abstract, strategy puzzle that is finished within 30 minutes tops.  

Couple the short play time with some nice looking artwork and the game works.

I just received it today from the Kickstarter, and we've already played twice. It's quick and easy to learn. It's definitely enjoyable, and models the books pretty well. The mix and match nature means there will be a ton of variety, which is also nice.

Not too sure if the theme actually affects the game play at all. The game is solid regardless.

I am not big on coops and this one didn't interest me enough despite the theme. It plays quickly, however.

Do you like winning?

Go play something else.

But if you enjoy playing games for the sake of playing, of solving puzzles and doing your best and getting things down to the wire while being able to accept the outcome, good or bad, this is the game for you. Low resources mean everything matters, and every play, whether a fire blast or a simple skipped turn, matters. Dresden Files fans will of course get the most out of it, but knowledge of the books isn't necessary to have fun solving cases and blasting vampires with your friends.

Remember that weird Devil's Attorney smartphone game? This is like a slower multiplayer version of that. Lame.

RATING: 6
Don't know the books at all, don't like games that deal with the demonic, but this looks really good!
Edit #1: I'll open my rating with a six. Not a lot of tension, really, for a game revolving around fate. But the gameplay is smooth and I've the full slate of material yet to discover, so I expect this to bump to a 7...

As often, if you don't know/like the theme you should knock a point or two off. It's a very nice little precise puzzle with other people. As a solo game, it's a really quick setup/knockdown puzzle.

I'm biased by this being my favorite fiction series, but I really enjoy the quick puzzle this game provides.  More unique art would have been nice, but the quality of the existing art is excellent.  The 2 player variant plays well.

Played the pnp version as a vassal module - I think it helps to have some familiarity with the books to understand the characters and situations better, but a fun quick playing game, with a lot of replayability due to randomised startup of the book decks.

Relatively difficult. Awesome if you're a fan of the series, but probably a bit bland if you haven't read the books. Tactically a tad shallow, but short and enjoyable.

This game is great fun! It doesn't have an alpha-player, quick to teach, and tough to win; and that's just what you want from a quick co-op game. Highly recommend.

A solid, thoughful, cooperative game which requires careful resource management and - a sure sign of careful design - is rarely either won or lost without feeling that it could have gone the other way.

I appreciate the theme. It's nice to be able to play as so many different characters in the Dresden Files universe...though it's slightly limiting that Harry has to be in every game. My groups enjoy cooperative games, so at least it has a good chance of seeing table time. That said, I'm not a fan of all the dice rolling. Also, the rarity of card drawing makes for very few options toward the end of the game; since interesting decisions are what make games fun, it seems counter-productive to ramp DOWN the players' choices as the game progresses instead of ramping UP to a big climax.

As co-ops go, this is cotton candy in a sea of spider silk. Its main draws are brevity and a healthy selection of characters and scenarios, though I'm not sure how one episode differs from another. Slightly different enemy card effects, I imagine.

If you're a fan of the books, the game might be worth trading for.  I've not read them myself, so I'll file this under "would not avoid" and keep walking.

An enjoyable and brain-busting cooperative game.  As a fan of the books, I found the experience evocative of them, but could see how someone who doesn't know the books would feel the experience is dry.  All the games I've played of it have been nail-biters.  It is very tight, and pretty fun.

Being a fan of the books I really enjoyed this game.  Characters and most of the game are excellent.  Final showdown however I wasn't too impressed with.  Still fun to play especially if you like the books...

The final showdown just feels like there should be more to it then there is... 

Loved the art on the cards too.  Hoping a future expansion or new rules could fix the ending of the game a bit more but I still recommend it...

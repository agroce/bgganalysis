Only most of one play, so take my rating with a large grain of salt. There might be a decent game under there, but it was so incredibly fiddly that we weren't able to find it. The production quality is very nice considering the micro print run (although I am not a fan of the money tiddlywinks at all). But there really isn't that much to do (there are only three different actions you can take) aside from the tons of upkeep and moving little bits around.

Very interesting idea building clinics in 3D and treating patients. Worth a play or 2 if you get a chance to try it but very constricted in how you build clinics and not very replayable.

RATING: 7
I agree with the sentiment that the game feels "unfinished," but only from a publishing stand-point. The biggest obstacle in learning/playing this game are the rules governing the spatial elements... specifically, what modules need to be adjacent to each other and whether they need to be adjacent on the same plane (2D adjacency) or adjacent in 6-directions (3D adjacency); The iconography is non-existent and the rulebook could be better (even v2.0). Combine that with a medium-heavy rule set, ambiguous rules, and a bunch of other modules that lack good iconography... the game can be very difficult to learn/play. 

But mechanically.... this game is not underdeveloped. In fact, it is refreshing, unique, and downright impressive. It is a game with an amazing amount of depth and a healthy amount of tension. It truly is one of those games that you can keep digging deeper in your mental calculations. And despite being a medium-heavy game, once you know the rules... it plays quickly and incredibly smoothly (30 mins per player seems generous). 

Suggestions for Players:
1) During setup, flip all service and specialized tiles upside down except one. This will help you remember that only 1 tile, of each kind, can be built per round. At the end of the round, flip any tiles facing down. 
2) Organize the type of tiles into columns. Thus, one column should have all the service tiles, another column should have all the specialized column, the room tiles should be in their own column, and the office tiles should be in their own column. Why? Because you can not build the same type of tile with 3D-adjacency. 
3)Include an extra marker to keep track of the turn. Put it above the VP-track if you want. I found myself forgetting which turn it was sometimes.
4)Purchase some sport counters. They are cheap and players can click them each time they move a cube (for 5 mins each). Towards the later rounds, when players are moving a lot... it helps prevent careless mistakes.
5)Make sure players add cars as soon as they admit patients. And when players bring patients to their player board... make sure they do one at a time (So they go to the proper service).  

Note about Components: This is essentially a self-published game with a small print-run. I'm very satisfied (and impressed) with what I got from the designer. But it should be mentioned that the components aren't up to the industry standard. Thin chits, one-sided chits, unmounted board, etc.

First Play: Mindful that this is a self published game I'm not going to bother with comments about the box and card stock (although the coins are awful). There are however some design issues which would have made things easier. The main board has turn order, time record and turn track all crammed into the top left hand corner with huge spaces dedicated to background art of buildings immediately next door!!! If the layout design had used  the space wisely, time tracking would have been much easier with more space and a turn sequence menu on the board would have helped considerably and there was so much space for it. I think I'll take this job on.

Next the rule book is logically laid out but the terminology has no parallels to a real hospital. What the hell is a specialisation module???? Well actually its a ward. All these weird terms need to be swapped out. And getting the example wrong on V1 AND V2 is just plain careless. It takes quite a while to explain the rules and early turns take longer to think through as things fall into place.

However the game is fantastic. Very brain burny, a nice level of interaction and competition for the buildings patient intake and hire of Doctors. So important to lay your hospital out properly. I like the opportunity to try different things to earn points and in our game all four of us were quite close. All of us swore to play differently next time. I feel the need to upgrade the components.

Juego de construcción y gestión de un hospital. Se juega en seis rondas y en cada ronda, cada jugador realizará tres acciones que pueden ser: construir mejoras en el hospital, contratar personal o admitir pacientes. 
Según la cantidad de pacientes que puedas atender recibes unos ingresos, de los que tendrás que descontar el mantenimiento del hospital y de la plantilla. y con el dinero restante, podrás comprar puntos de prestigio, que son los que realmente te dan la victoria.

De momento, solo lo he jugado a cuatro y fue incompleta, porque hubo confusiones con las reglas, pero creo que puede ser un buen juego. El reglamento en ocasiones resulta algo ambiguo.

En todo caso, no es un juego apto para no jugones.

Está autoeditado y con una tirada escasa y con componentes algo malillos, pero la idea del juego parece buena. Me reservo las conclusiones para más adelante.

The three dimensional layout is fun (tho sometimes confusing when trying to stack upward) and the idea of treating sick patients is interesting when translated to a board game.  I did have some issues with the game, one being that it tended to get quite mathy, in some cases requiring us to pull out some calculators to make sure we were getting the figures correct.  Some minor quibbles are 1) I felt the no-two-like buildings next to each other was completely unnecessary considering the myriad of other restrictions 2) I didn't like how a red doctor needed nurses to treat a white patient and 3) I thought there needed to be more special buildings or something else to add to replayability.  All in all, its a decent game, but it may be too long and fiddly for me.

A very quick simulation of building and managing a clinic. The game resolves around action selection and time management. Within an hour players have multiple level clinics capable of healing all the sick patients queued up outside.

The building rules are not very clear, we had to check the rules several times and found some ambiguous rulings, e.g. "Rooms must be build adjacent to services", elsewhere in the rules is written: "if a room is not adjacent to a service...".

The game itself is complex and you find yourself with fewer actions as desired. Playing time is a little long, with four newbies we played for appr. 3.5 hours.

So far all my plays are solitaire with a variant I'm working on. I'm quite intrigued by this one and look forward to trying it out with more players. I'm thinking that 3P may be the sweet spot, at least with my slow-playing group, due to all the building considerations.

https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/114205/clinic-solitaire-variant-mega-clinic

UPDATE: One 3P play so far and I'm cautiously optimistic about this game. It's a simultaneous action selection game where you all choose one of build, hire, admit and then reveal and actions are done in turn order among each action type. I only say "cautiously" because the game seems to dry up a bit towards the end of the game due to the end of round patient removals (a design choice I don't quite get, honestly, but I need to play more) and there are some turns where you just don't have a lot of options regarding getting patients (which you need for income).

Outside of that concern, the gameplay is very interesting and fun for two primary reasons. First, with the simultaneous action selection, turn order becomes huge, and trying to be out of step with your opponents is a lot fun. You can get screwed if you guess wrong what the people ahead of you will do. I can't even imagine how this would play 4P in that regard. I'd sure hate to be last (turn order is reverse of VPs, so it's a balancer). Second, the game puts great pressure on you in a lot of different ways.

You build rooms in three dimensions - left, right, and up - in 1-3 buildings depending on what you manage to fit onto your player board. In addition to all the space concerns on your player mat for your rooms is the time management element you have. You have to move patients, nurses, doctors, and staff to the right rooms. 

The "right" rooms are those where patients can be matched with doctors of the same level. So, a red (critical) patient has to be cared for by a red doctor. Nurses help change the colors of your doctors as needed, and staff reduce your costs. The time you spend moving people ends up as negative VPs at game end. As if that weren't enough, you have to find parking spaces for all these people which makes adding rooms you desperately need even more difficult. [i]Ai carumba![/i]I think we all found it very compelling.

It took a bit of time to explain and then we did a one round (3 actions) restart. Once we finally started at 9pm, we finished up at midnight, and I would expect every first game to be slow due to all the spatial concerns.

Interesting and complex building a Clinic in 3d. In our game we ran our of patiences to cure. I had a great Clinic but only the start player got any patiences. It had the same catch up as in Power Grid but with worse balance of resources.

Preliminary rating after some solo play and one 2P game.  I really like the overall system and options.  It has the same giddy feel of building your own hospital like 90s era PC games, but it plays like a well crafted boardgame.  My only concern is whether the hospital designs will start being rather the same with repeated plays, but I look forward finding out, and I have all the expansions waiting to mix in as needed.  Can't wait to play again!

Naming games with fake, inventive backward letters just to get people to click a stupid game to see what's it all about is typical carpetbagger approach. The only reason why it's a top game is because people want to check if the backwards C was a mistake. BGG should not even allow non standard alphabetic characters, so they cut out rubbish like this. if the game just said "Clinic", nobody would care because it's a stupid name for a game anyway. This is the same scam they pulled on that game called CV which is not about Aircraft Carriers.... but it will be soon..

Juego de gestión de recursos ambientado en un hospital. 

Un poco lioso de explicar, sobre todo lo relacionado con la construcción del hospital de cada jugador, pero una vez te metes al lío fácil de jugar. Se trata de ir gestionando un hospital, construyendo nuevas salas donde los médicos, enfermeras y staff que contratamos irán atendiendo a los pacientes que admitimos, que por cierto tienen diferentes niveles de gravedad, y se nos pueden morir!!. Y esas son las tres acciones que puedes hacer cada ronda. Una vez hechos tres turnos de una acción cada uno, pasaremos a cobrar por los pacientes tratados y pagaremos el mantenimiento de nuestra plantilla e instalaciones. Y aquí una de las primeras cosillas diferentes del juego, la fuente principal de puntos se consigue comprando con el dinero que has producido ese turno, no sirve el que acumulas de un turno para el siguiente. Eso que te guardas lo podrás invertir en la construcción del hospital, que es quizás lo más diferente del juego, se construye en una tablero personal donde hay que tener algo de visión espacial ya que las tipicas adyacencias lo son también en altura.

Quizás se le puede achacar que dependiendo de los pacientes que vayan saliendo puedes estar totalmente fuera de la partida a pesar de lo bien que lo puedas estar haciendo. Por supuesto, es un juego que si la cagas, hasta luego, muy complicado remontar.

Alban’s own description here on BGG makes Clinic sound like Age of Steam in a hospital. Patients and doctors of similar color (competence and severity of condition) have to be matched to generate revenue. Only revenues surmounting costs can be transformed to prestige points. Each piece of infrastructure and each employee generate costs. Building the infrastructure is subject to a host of restrictions.

Clinic works, is a challenge, initially interesting but ultimately too long (>3 hours on first play) for the limited payout. It also suffers from the lack of development by a third party. Some elements rarely or not at all used (parcs!) could have been eliminated, some elements are too cumbersome to be enjoyable (movement) and the rules are among the worst I’ve experienced in a long time. 8 pages took two read-throughs and 1,5 hours in total to prepare for this game. Clinic was enjoyable once as a thematic economic game but in future I rather play Age of Steam or Ground Floor instead as more accessible while deeper experiences.

Dropped rating from 7 -> 6. 

Continued to have difficulty wrapping my brain around the spatial restrictions in this one so I'm passing it on to someone else in the hopes they can enjoy the game more than I. I'd also rather just play a couple other Viard titles before this one so I don't feel the need to hang onto this one. 

FIRST IMPRESSION:

First play was incomplete as we couldn't wrap our heads around the building rules in their entirety.  Otherwise the gameplay is fairly simple to grasp - just the execution and planning is the challenging part!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the theme and there's some neat stuff happening here. I want to try it again. However, there are a lot of things I don't like. In many ways this is very similar to Healthy Heart Hospital, a co-op that does a lot of similar things but which we found to be a bit too easy. Imagine that game, harder, with a bunch of other stuff tacked on to it. When I think hospital, I think of treating sick patients, I don't really think of hospital administration. So I want to be able to hire nurses, but I don't want to literally have to worry about where they will park their car. I want to have to move patients around efficiently, but I don't want weird restrictions that a surgical ward cannot be built directly above a cardiac ward. Why? 

Still, it's got some neat things happening and I'm happy to try it again.

I am very disappointed in the player order, as I think the randdom start order can really screw you.  However, I hope we got the rule wrong.  Difficult for me to see the 3D building in my mind, and the building rules were not transparent to me.  Want to try again and see if I can't handle it a bit better.

The next play went much better but my spatial awareness still total rubbish, but at least I was more competitive.  Quite an involved game but a good one, trying to do a lot in very limited numbers of turns.

9/16: Did a bit better but still lost too many points on time.  Also, a few missed rules damaged me a lot.  Need to play a couple more times to get it to flow, I guess.

Based on one play: We made some errors in the rules which I think hurt the end game as it was too easy to cure patients, so I will reserve final judgement till we play again. You build your hospital up, for which you can have a few buildings and there are specific rules to building, which is actually the most complicated part tof the game, remembering these rules. Then you need doctors, nurses and patients to earn money. The theme is very well done and the game works really well as you build your hospital engine and compete for doctors and even patients. I'm sure it will be even better once we get all the building rules down.

Clinic is a complex logistics game about building and running a hospital.  Players have to build facilities of different medical specialties on a three-dimensional grid board, hire doctors, nurses, and staff members to run the hospital, and then compete with other players to attract patients who they can treat given the services offered and the experience level of the doctors.  The game also makes the player deal with things like having sufficient parking for everyone, and the time involved in moving through the facility.  I found it very odd that doctors, once hired, gradually become less and less skilled--this didn't make much sense to me, it was very hard to prevent, and it had a huge impact on the game.  Also, the competition for the limited pool of patients can get quite fierce toward the end of the game, and it's very easy to get screwed just due to turn order.  I also thought that the game was too short (not to mention the patient pool) for the grand complex that the player boards seem to imply that one should strive for.  On the whole, I thought this was a bit of a disappointment.  I do like complex logistics games, but this one just had an unfinished feel to it, like it needed some more refinement to get everything balanced correctly.

This game has very poor components, but the gameplay works out to be both confusing and fascinating. You do six rounds of three actions, and your actions are either, build things in your hospital, hire workers for your hospital, or lastly get sick people to cure. Each of these three actions has an economy to it. There aren't enough building tiles for everyone to do what they want to do, there aren't enough doctors at reasonable prices, and there absolutely and most critically there aren't enough sick people for you to cure. Particularly towards the last few rounds. The game also imposes a lot of building requirements on you, which are both interesting and puzzily, and kind of difficult to get used to. At the end of the game you have this nice hospital layout. I found the game satisfying after one play, but the big question is, aside from the learning curve, was the game actually fun? I'm not sure. I need to see how long this bounces around in my head for. It has the potential to be a favorite game, or a frustrating dust collector. Too soon to tell.

(+) Very original logistics game. Feels fresh.

(+) Some nice engine building aspects.

(+) It is plain fun to build a 3D-puzzle in the most efficient way to move people through and to try to plan for the best returns.


(-) Being late in turn order adds too much unpredictability to the game. There is little way of mitigating this randomness but refraining from scoring points (obviously not a very good strategy!)

(-) Game material is slightly under par with a game board printed on thin plastic paper and self-cut thin tiles. More $1-coins could have been provided to ease excessive money-change operations. However, given the fact that the author released the game himself and given the reasonable price for a game printed in such a small print-run, I totally understand this situation. Luckily the graphics are good and the player aids are helpful.

(-) Manual does not clarify all the rules. Some rules are fidly (you might get a bonus build action when building a room, some fidly adjacency-rules, ...).

(-) Quite some book-keeping when calculating time spent moving people through your hospital and calculating income/expenses.


Approx game time:
- 30 min/player when doing all the bookkeeping simultaniously (but this will only be possible with people who have played the game before)

- 45-50 min/player when doing the bookkeeping sequentially in player order.

Great game. Complex and deep, but the rules could be better. The components are hand made. Thematically, the pill makes sense, but given it's shape it will roll off the table. I think a different pill (disc shaped) could've been better.

There is also a spatial element some people may not be able to wrap their heads around, but if you can, it won't distract from the game.

If you can get past the components, I think it works well and has enough fun and strategy to suggest it to new players.

Clinic is a fairly detail hospital simulation game... down to figuring out where to park your patients cars. There's a spatial element in that you have to build your hospital on multiple floors and it's important what is adjacent to what, not only in terms of what is allowed or makes sense, but also in that spending time moving places is bad. You also have to build multiple buildings and place all the cars for your staff and patients which makes the spatial part of the game challenging.

There's three actions you can take in the game and each round you'll can do three actions (although you aren't allowed to do the same things three times in a row). The first is building rooms and "transporters". The second is hiring staff. And the last is admitting patients. Players select the actions simultaneously and then execute them by type (all build actions first) and in player order.

There's a weird dichotomy in the game in that patients progressively get sicker until you heal them (or they die) but doctors get progressively worse as time goes along. You want to have a doctor who's only just as good as he needs to be to cure a disease or else they need a nurse to offset the difference (either positive or negative). Sicker patients pay more when cured, but they're also closer to dying which gives you a penalty.

There's a time cost to entering and moving around in the hospital, be it getting doctors, nurses, administration or patients to where they need to go. And that time cost will cost you points at the end of the game. That's an interesting mechanic in the game, which is offset by the "teleporters" that essentially allow you to warp meeples as far along a straight line with no time cost as long as there's a transporter station at each end.

My first play of this had to be cancelled after the second turn, but I got a pretty good feel for what type of game this is. In a lot of ways it reminds me of Ground floor, but with a spatial element and more complicated. I really want to play a full game of this now.

Heads up, this is a DTP game, in a DTP box, so expect DTP quality.  The wooden bits are great but the counter and player board stock is thin cardboard bat best.

Healthcare simulation laying out a 3-D medical services complex with tile placement while managing the staffing and patient care through pick up and deliver. As a six sigma and lean management guy, I really appreciate how this game embraces logistics and process modeling to achieve fast, efficient and high quality patient care.  Our community hospital is building an annex and it reminds me of this game every time I drive by on the way to work...Ah, there is the service entrance, a skybridge shortcut, and of course where to put the parking.

This seems like it's excellent, and very, very challenging.  It's a lot of fun to play, but it seems that hiring one red doctor and hosting one red patient in turn one jump starts your engine so much faster than when it's white and white. I have doubts about the balance of this aspect of the game…. Fortunately, there's so much interesting going on, it still ends up at an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] for me. If I were more sure that this is balanced, I think it would be at least a [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b]….

I think there is a great game here but I suspect my rating will be higher with the expansion. Love the efficiency challenge, I think my favorite part of the game is the dynamics about time spent by patients and doctors

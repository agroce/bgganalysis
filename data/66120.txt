RANK: 2534

RATING: 6
4 plays / 2,4 players.

LIKE: Tile placement and picking the animals is fun. Quick game.
DISLIKE: Very light, basically a race game. Not many decisions to make with 2 players, better with 3 or more.
OVERALL: Great for kids. I don't feel the 2 player version isn't really good, but the 4 player did have a little tension.

(Originally w/2 players we were playing it wrong. After replay, a slightly better game but still light.)

Cute theme, my daughter just enjoys collecting the animals and having a good time with her zoo at the moment. The scoring at the end doesn’t really matter. 

Taking a truck that she has an eye on for herself can be dangerous for the sake of finishing the game. I normally avoid taking ‘her’ trucks but I’m having little chats with her about the possibility of it happening. 

A good game but I think it will play better in a year or two’s time. Not one my daughter requests at the moment but she enjoys it when we play.

A lighter version of Zooloretto, with all the "difficult" stuff (coin actions) removed for smoother easier play with kids.

Everything feels less meaningful when viewed with a gamer's perspective, but played with my 5-and-half daughter it was quite satisfactory: she easily understood every rule, and immediately got the points table... And played it without any help except for the math on final scoring.

I guess it will be played again...

Cute boardgame version of Coloretto, an a cut down version of Zooloretto.  Players take an action - draw and place a tile on a truck, or take a truck.  The idea is to take trucks full of animals and squeeze them into your Zoo.  If you can get your enclosures filled up without too much diversity, you'll score well otherwise the penalty points begin to kick in.  Nicely illustrated with cute animal tiles.  Nothing too taxing here - slots right into the light filler boardgame category.  This is basically Zooloretto without the money, or the myriad of expansions that render the game unplayable.  A much cleaner, and better, experience.

[b]KID'S GAME:[/b]  A cute set collection game that takes ~15 minutes to play.  My 6 year old daughter really enjoys it.    

In the game you are collecting 3 types of animals for your zoo by drawing tiles blindly from the bag and loading them on trucks for delivery.  Where to place the different animals and when to select the truck you want for your zoo are critical to your success! 

A really great game for introducing younger gamers to light strategic decision making and tactical calculations while not completely boring the pants off the adults either.

Seems like you could play the "mini" version with components from the main game.  If you wanted it to be really portable, seems like you could play without the trucks or player boards at all and just use careful placement on the table to differentiate things, and remember the 1-2-3-4-8-12 progression on animal values at the end of game.

This can be both a stand alone game or an expansion. 
YAY! :)

Really different from Zooloretto base as there are no money actions, but still retains much of the strategy of the original due to the placement of animals aboard the trucks. 

Really quick and fun little filler.

RATING: 6
Played 5 times with 3&4 players.

Fits a nice niche for time required and simplicity of play. I prefer Zooloretto to this, but for younger families or casual gamers, Mini is a great pickup. (And I can play Mini with my large base game, so it is the best of both worlds.)

Played 5 times for 2.25 hours.

RATING: 6.5
I was surprised to learn that this "mini" version isn't that much smaller than the original, with tiles that feature different animals, but seem to be compatible with it. It has been slightly simplified in that there is no money to worry about, and the zoo enclosures only allow up to 6 animals, but now there is an immediate reward for completing each enclosure.  For families that don't already have Zooloretto, this would be a slightly cheaper, but just as good of an option.  Otherwise, this game offers little that's new.

It's like Zooloretto only it's mini!! Sort of a half-way house between Coloretto and Zooloretto... Gone is the money and the various sized enclosures.. now there are just 3 enclosures holding up to 6 items (animals or landscape). There are still baby animals however.. and negative points for types of animal/landscape in the barn.

This is my favorite of the series.  My second favorite is aquaretto but it goes on a little long for what it is.  Coloretto is too simple, but has a neat idea with the truck mechanism.  This is the perfect in between, short, animal placement, trucks, and not too many eXtras besides the landscape tiles, which are fun.  A really fun, quick game!

I think the strategy eludes my son right now (5) and let's face it, I can imagine for a little boy it isn't much to look at either. So he, very understandably, thinks this is a bit boring. I'm holding onto it in case he changes his mind at some point, as from my perspective, the game is pretty solid.

Better than Coloretto, but still crazy light. This one adds more scoring opportunities and context (zoo) while still keeping the playing time under 15 minutes in a 2 player game. I've only played it with 2 thus far, but I feel like it would be more interesting with more players. If it took 30 minutes or more (with 2),  I probably wouldn't keep it, but at 15 minutes, it gives you a decent amount to think about.

Streamlined Zooloretto. It's pleasant game like others in this series from quick Coloretto to deep Aquaretto. Zooloretto Mini gets rid of complex stuff so it's great if you want Coloretto experience with little bit of animal theme (i.e. you are playing with children or other animal fans).

So somebody in my gaming group had been teasing me with this game's existence for awhile... the Meerkats as the main Box Art along with Meerkats being not only available for this game, but easily swapped in for any other animal in the original Zooloretto obviously put this game up high on my wish list. 

But while the Meerkats and other new animals were exciting, the idea of a simpler Zooloretto really wasn't. I mean the game isn't a brain burner to start with. I really like Zooloretto and it is heavy enough to be very entertaining to play. But it isn't one of those games I long to play if I haven't played it recently like say The Princes of Florence or Power Grid is. 

However I was WRONG. The streamlined simpler version has all the fun of the original with just enough less fiddlyness to make it a GREAT little game. It actually feels more like its card game inspiration Coloretto in play than zooloretto ever has to me and yet it feels MORE FUN with this theme to me than the card game.

I think this could be an Awesome "gateway" game. It has the potential to really really help convert traditional gamers into Euro-gamers, or introduce people to gaming in general, with the obvious ability to "Step-Up" the strategy by introducing zooloretto after this game has gone over well.

The other games I use in combo to "step up" really new players sometimes is TransAmerica -> Ticket to Ride ... but I think Zooloretto Mini -> Zooloretto could work even better, especially when kids are involved.

So I was delighted by this game on several levels!!

It isn't heavy but it has enough strategy to be fun and plays in just the right amount of time for what it is. A great fairly light but not entirely luck driven game.

The base concept is very simple, so I don't know if this is the best game for playing 50 minutes or so my game group takes to play this, vis a vis something like 7 Wonders, the base game of which has a bit more tension, and less across-the-table move optimization commentary. There is just enough in this game that it's almost a little deep for light gaming. I'm going to get the dice Zooloretto game and give it a comparison, I'll see which one wins out.

At its core a great game, but I not only have difficulty imagining that I'd play this myself over Coloretto/Zooloretto/Aquaretto, but I also think it targets an extremely narrow niche of players who are too young to play Zooloretto (8+) and old enough to understand this game's mathy scoring... If this game is appropriately rated for 7+, I think that's a small group, indeed.

[b]Zooloretto Junior[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Zooloretto Junior is the first "junior" version of a game that I really like and in fact I like it much more than Zooloretto. In the junior version you are only concerned with filling in three enclosures by placing animals in the trucks (my favorite part of the original game) so that tension. Granted that introduces a bit of take that into the game, but my kids, even my 6 yo, has no problem with that. You also have some different garden tiles that can score you points and you still lose points for animals in your barn [i](those that you can place in enclosures)[/i]. The parts that are removed from the game are the money, which I found extraneous, and instead bonus actions are triggered by completing an enclosure. 

This is one of those games that works great for my 6 yo, but is also enjoyed by myself, my wife and older daughter which is the hallmark of a great children's game to me. Similar to Dreamworks and their animated films being enjoyable for kids and parents to watch. I would play this as an opener or closer at a game night as well, the game works that well.

I've now played Zooloretto, Zooloretto Dice and Zooloretto Junior and Zooloretto Junior is the clear winner and game I'd highly recommend for families and gamers alike. I do have a copy of Zooloretto Dice because it is a compact travel game perfect for restaurants, etc.[/i]

RATING: 7.8
I haven't play Zooloretto, so I can't say how it compares, but Zooloretto Mini is a very very good family game. There is enough strategy for adults to enjoy it while being simple enough for young kids to play. There is no reading required so any kids over about 6 or 7 should have no problem playing it. The aim of the game is to collect animals for your zoo. When I play with my 8 year old daughter, we normally set up a zoo for each of us, and then one for my youngest daughter (4). My youngest daughter gets all the discarded animals for her zoo which makes her feel like she is playing (which she kind of is). I am pretty sure she has even won or come very close to winning just from getting the discarded animals.

First impression was good - I really like how they made this game cheaper and accessible (cardboard trucks, put-together player boards). But after 3 plays it seems to me I'd rather play the simpler Coloretto or the bigger Aquaretto. 

The game has the main Zooloretto/Aquaretto problem, namely it's hard to read what others are collecting (in the name of cuteness). It also has a limited space for big a set you can collect and while it seems like it would add a twist (it does) it's just not that interesting - you mustn't build your zoo too fast! What? 

It's fine, it's accessible and a tad forgettable. 
Edit: cooling down on the whole series. They just needed to made one that's cute and readable and streamlined. It's not this one. No reason for this one to exist.

RATING: 9
I'm rating this as a game for 7yo+ (and up).

I don't advise starting kids on this earlier than the recommended 7. I tried to introducing it at 5 (based on BGGers' recommended age in the poll + comments in forums), but that spoiled the game for my kid, who could not quite understand it and soon did not want to play anymore. 

Yes, under7s can enjoy playing along on a team with someone older, as the idea of building a zoo and collecting animals is very appealing to them. But playing to win is too hard for the under7s, the older ones get too much of an advantage with their understanding of the scoring. 

Lesson learnt from this game: Do not trust BGGers' age ratings. Either they get carried away by each other, or they all have gamer Mozarts ...

Putting this on the table too soon for two years seemed to have ruined the game for him. Luckily, he pulled it out again at almost 7yo, and now likes it and can play on his own. Though his strategies are still quite poor ... But I'm hopeful that it will grow on him/he will grow into the game. I love playing it.

GAME: The Institute for Magical Arts
RANK: 3210

RATING: 8.37
The game mechanics are really interesting: collect or spend power tokens to gain cards (for set collection, powers, points). 
It is a bit harder to learn than other two-player games with similar play time. It is quick and requires a lot decision making and guessing what your opponent is up to.
It is also good for travelling, due to the compact game box.

Great simple interactive card dice game - rating after about 10 games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another steady filler from The Finn. Play seems well paced until players bash heads over the same artifact, which grinds the game to a stall. The card powers are fun, but the execution order makes them overly tedious. Some starting artifacts seems to be objectively better than others, and I recommend beginning the game with two, in order to speed up play and complexify early game decisions. I love how the Portal works, except that the Ethereal Realm is overtly overpowered. Also, the Charms seem totally unnecessary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A reasonable filler with nice card art and an interesting theme.  The Charms seem a superfluous mechanic, and the teachers are a little too-high risk for their low reward, but the other cards are interesting enough to make up for this.

Kickstarter. Intéressant jeu de majorité pour 2 joueurs! Le portail apporte un bluff et une tension très appréciée dans la partie! Oui il y as des dés, mais il y a beaucoup de manière de la «gérer», de plus les parties sont assez rapide (alentour de 30min) En plus, c'est presque Harry Potter comme thème! 

+ extension ethereal powers:
Plus de cartes, plus grande variabilité!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Institute for Magical Arts is a two player grudge match between McGonagall and Snape for Headmaster at Hogwarts...

Well, no it isn't, but it is a 2 player grudge match for mastery at a magical school, hint, hint, wink wink, and it's a terrific game, better than Biblios, I think.

Unlike Biblios, players don't change the values of the victory conditions, but they do battle over whom has the greatest magical edge to claim Teachers and magical artifacts at their school.

Dice are used to apply magic bidding stones to various cards, and the magic portal allows the players to hedge their bets and shift their stones.

All in all, there's a remarkable amount of control for a dice driven game, and it plays quickly and easily.

There's a new wizard/sheriff in town, move over Biblios.

P.s. The dice application is also reminiscent of Roma/Arena from Feld, but Institute is more of a strategic tug of war, with some control over the dice, in competition for the cards, where Roma is more of a scrum, with both teams pushing and building to get over a line of scrimnage- the cards in Roma are already in active use, and it's more a matter of how they can be activated.

I think Institute is the superior game, though not as fast.

This game caught me by surprise. It was more or less an insta-buy because it is designed by Steve Finn, a designer great 2-player games. I played this the same day I played Capo dei Capi for the first time. Capo (also by Finn) is much lighter, more random and a fraction of the length. This one has some meat on the bones, gives players a good amount of options and takes about an hour. 

Pros: 
-Cool/fun theme
-Small footprint
-Intuitive

Cons: 
-A little long for what it is. It doesn't necessarily outstay its welcome, but it's just a touch long. I think this is easily fixed by changing the winning condition from 20 to 15. Because the fix is so easy to implement, I won't count off for that.
-The components are a bit bland. I wish there were stickers or more variety in the components. Even Capo had better. 

Overall, this is an excellent game!

Sold 10/5/16 via GeekBay for $15.

Bought direct from Dr. Finn's 9/15/16.

Solid mechanics, but didn't "wow" us.  The theme was pretty thin, and a lot of the art wasn't to our taste.  It's too bad because I REALLY wanted to love this.  The influence stones system just seemed... dry.

Pretty quick to learn, plays fairly quick, great art, solid components.  Some luck involved but the limited ability to reroll and the dice assignment allows the luck factor to be limited.  So far I would rate this among the best 2 player games out there.

[i]Another game Mat taught me, he thought I would enjoy it and he was right. I really enjoyed the area control aspect of the game that comes into play when you are trying to get cards from the center row. I also appreciated how dice were used in this game, basically the numbers on the dice tell you which cards you can try to gain control of by placing influence discs or you could take that many influence discs from the supply. You also have re-roll tokens that you can get back, but at the cost of points.[/i]

Players: 2.  Time: 60-90 min.  Fantastic 2-player game-- one of my favorites.  Lots of strategy and tactical decisions, but not too heavy of a brain burner.  A very underrated game in my opinion.
The character cards are a little too-high risk for their low reward, but the other cards are interesting enough to make up for this.

Sounded fun in theory. The rulebook, though needlessly wordy and complicated for such a light game, gave me the impression  that this is a fun game, but it didn't really turn out that way. Card effects needed more engine building components. Never felt like card effects did anything besides screw over the opponent and I felt forced to fight over a card just so I don't have to deal with it being used against me then just felt that I was cheated when dice rolls didn't go my way, with the few luck mitigation components given to me. I never really felt the excitement that a dice game gives, nor did I feel the tension of an auction or area control game. The last rounds of the game didn't really feel like we were reaching some kind of climax. All it did was just sort of taper off.

RATING: 8
This is a wonderfully tense 2-player battle.  You get the trademark dice management found in most of Dr. Finn's games.  Plus you get an awesome area majority mechanism that features a cool twist with the differentials.  Awesome game with a lot of depth and replayability.

RATING: 6.5
The Institute for Magical Arts offers dice rolling + resource management + area control + set/item collecting in a light and cleverly-designed package. If you've played a Steve Finn game, then you know what to expect: a small, excellent filler-ish affair that doesn't outstay its welcome. If you haven't played one of his games, you owe it to yourself to try one! This game is great for 2 players, but if your gaming occurs in groups, give his Biblios a look as well.

I love rolling dice when I can actually mitigate what I am doing with said dice. This game is excellent, despite the reused, non-engrossing artwork and the similiar "stone" components.  This is a perfect two person game with great tactics and just a bit of luck, but not too much that you feel "out of control."

Only played once to learn it so no rating yet, but this completely fires Arena/Roma. That game was dull and you really fell victim to the card draws and dice rolls. This game uses the same basic system but provides more options and much more interesting decisions.

Finally got a play in, fun and fast little game.  I always love the mechanic of battling for area control with influence to win cards, exactly why A Study in Emerald is my favorite game.  That's mostly all this game is with a few tricks, and some nice bluffing and mind games.   I like it!

Two player dice and card game filler as wizards compete in a race to fill the shoes of the absent headmaster. Dice placement on a central tableau determines where your power stones are placed to gain control of magic items, characters or go into the ether realm for other benefits. Identical action decks are used to simultaneously place these power stones.  Don't run out of power stones! The portal adds a welcome distraction or complicator. The control battle for desirable cards in the central tableau can be tedious and drag out.

Steve Finn is rocking my world with his quick two player games. This one has young mages trying to become the new headmaster of the school by proving their prowess in wizardiness. It's a light area/dice control game that plays in about half an hour or so. Super light version of Argent. Which is a game I need to see on the table more.

It's a battle of pips between two mages vying over leadership of the Institute of Magical Arts, a game as dry as its name. It's no Hogwarts. Lots of fiddly rules are jammed together to make a playable game from a surplus of uninspiring components. But I like games with area control, dice, resource management and simultaneous action selection.  Chances to thwart opponent are high through use of cards, but with all information on the table, attacks are not a surprise. Overall, not so bad.

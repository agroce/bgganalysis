+ Just a fun dice-chucking fest with an interesting build-your-own-armies part at the beginning.
- A lot of it just comes down to luck (but that can be fun too if you just embrace it!).


Why it's previously-owned:
This is a game I wouldn't have minded holding on to, but I have a friend who I'm kinda helping getting his own game collection going so I gifted this one to him.
This one got gifted away for free.

The rules match the theme nicely, but there's not much strategy and it drags a bit.  The difference between the kinds of gladiators doesn't add much, except that without it you would notice how little gameplay there is.

RATING: 5
very good theme for a knizia.  i love the chariot-drafting portion of the game, and player elimination is handled in a fairly elegant although uninteresting manner.  the latter bit makes me a bit more surprised that there's no sort of restriction on beating the injured, although i could also easily see how that could push things into too safe a zone for a dice-based bashfest.  i like thinking about drafting choices a lot more than playing the game, and it seems like something great could be developed out of this sort of system.  as-is, it's not this game though.  at least for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is an odd Knizia title in that it focuses on direct confrontation and has an almost unelegant feel to its mechanics.  Luck is a definte factor and a string of bad die rolls can play havoc on a player.  It is almost better to be eliminated quickly and to take over running the animals than it is to be left reduced and very weakened, but still alive.  Since the game can not be taken as much more than light fare, it gets the positive nod, but game time can quickly exceed its welcome.

Dice fest, I love the theme of this game and the beginning setup phase, trying to put together that 'perfect team'. Not a lot of choices to be made after that beyond who you might think you can win against. Love that even when being knocked out of the game early you can still win.

This dicefest is fantastic! With more than 3 it gets a little chaotic, but with 2 or 3 I think it really shines. And when you're eliminated, you can still attack your opponents with the animals!!

RATING: 7
This game fills a good niche: it's silly and short. I'm still trying to figure out the relative worth of some gladiator types and have been experimenting with extremes (All swords, 3 sheilds and 1 sword, etc.). This is a great game to end a session or fill the gaps between meatier games.

There's enough strategy and thought to it that it isn't a lightweight game, but it is also lighter than what I would call a middleweight game.  It's fun and requires some thought when drafting your teams and also when choosing which team to attack with and where you want to attack.

Easily learned and engaging dice game that uses gladitorial combat as a theme. Hex-gridded gameboard and mechanics for gladitorial combat is reminiscent of (but not the same as) Battle Cry or Memoir '44. Probably too light for most Eurogamers.

RATING: 3
Boring!  Game choices are pretty obvious (i.e. fill your gladiator team with as many swordsmen as you can... and attack the weakest thing that you can reach).  Something about the wound markers (wooden stars) annoyed me... I think there was a rules ambiguity as to whether a full hit on a guy that was already injured resulted in another wooden star (wound) being applied to someone else on the gladiator team (even though the attack was directed at the injured, and now dead, guy).

The more you play, the more you realize just how pointless this game is.  Seems like there should be some interesting decisions in there in terms of which gladiators to put in which chariots, but all of that is so grossly outweighed by the luck of the dice rolling that the game becomes a waste of time.

RATING: 7
Disposed of; not because it's a bad game - it isn't, so long as you're in the mood for some dice-rolling - but because it was never likely to be chosen ahead of so many of my other good games.  Oddly enough, the final nail in the coffin was Dancing Dice – another dice rolling extravaganza - which is, arguably, not as good a game but is one my kids like and so will get played.  And there are plenty of other dice rolling combat games still set aside for 'when they're old enough'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Neat game, very possibly might go up to a 9 if it's still being played in a year (which is a possibility). Knizia cleverly circumvents the kingmaking problems fundamentally associated with these games. Also has that Knizia touch of being simple and feeling light, and so being accessible, but still having enough depth and theme to engage the serious gamer. I like dice games, and all the different ways the various Gladiators effect the die-rolls is great. Unique for a German game, and definitiely recommended; with Puerto Rico, my favorites from Nurnburg 2002 and far ahead of the pack. Shocked & awed that people feel there is no strategy to this game; sure, it's no Puerto Rico on that count, but picking your gladiator team composition & match-ups is not trivial and good play wins games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun dicefest!  Assemble a motley crew of gladiators, put them into some carts, and then fight fight fight!  Some people won't like that beating up on the weak is generally the best thing to do, but I can tolerate it in something as beer and pretzels as this game is.

Even when you lose your gladiators, you still get to play as the animals, so you're never out of it!

RATING: 2
"Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again"

Yup, that sums it up very nicely. I am quite frankly shocked by Chris Farrell's rating. Dull as dull can be... I can sort of see that a six-year-old might enjoy it. Fair enough. But I'm sure I would at that age have still gone for Gambler or Yahtzee over this dreck. 

This is the game to show people overly idolizing Reiner Knizia. Even the best have their bad days. 

Thumbs down! Put this game out of its misery, gladiator!

I don't like this game.  A game with huge kingmaking oppurtunities, can't catch the leader, and its a dicefest.  After the draft, which isn't even all that great because nothing is really scarce, that's about it. At least you get to come back as an animal when you die, but that isn't even all that much fun.  If you built your little carts with abilities and you didn't lose those abilities until the whole cart was dead- It like this one a lot more.

RATING: N/A
Fun game.  I have a picture of the last game I played with my friends, all the Shield dudes got picked before any other gladiators.  Although this game is meant to be lite and quick, somehow in my gaming group, on our 2nd play (the Shields game) we took it fairly seriously and it took a little longer than it should have, but it was still really fun.  This is one of those games, for me, that tells a story, which is always great and exactly what I am looking for in a game.  The game just has this momentum where it feels like it's always moving forward, which is good.  The dice really can swing results, so you have to be comfortable enough with getting screwed over every now and then.  The good news is, you'll (probably, but no guarantees) get a few lucky rolls every now and then to make up for it.

1 play... Fun dice strategy, rollin', and theme. Compared to Can't Stop and Liar's Dice, two other dice games I consider good, this one offers so much theme, theme, theme.

RATING: 8
I don't feel this game is the clunker that most of these comments described, its just for a different target audience than most of us fall in. There is a fair amount of strategy in the drafting of gladiators and the initial placement. Its very cool the way they can work together in teams and how SIMPLE the rules for how they work are. 

However, the combat between players does come down to dice and is easily very chaotic and very luck-driven. The thing is....as I was playing this with my 4-year old it was great! He was able to easily follow the rules for what each guy does. The graphic representation is very engaging. And, despite me having the opportunity to make decisions and try to win the game, he beat me. 

So, if you are interested in an elegantly simple, richly-themed, short-playing, beer and pretzels dicefest which could easily be played with younger players...this is your game. I think this was intended for a table full of 7 year old boys, but it works well for a dad and his young child.

Juego de peleas con dados en el que cada jugador preparará sus equipos de gladiadores para luchar en la arena...los diferentes gladiadores te dan una habilidad en plan: lanzas un dado extra, lanzas primero, anulas un gladiador del otro equipo a tu elección... Finalmente ganas puntos por cada gladiador y animal que hayas matado en la arena. Lo curioso del juego es que no es eliminatorio ya que cuando te quedas sin gladiadores puedes seguir controlando los animales de la arena y ganando puntos.

Very enjoyable, heavily themed dice & combat game from ... Reinar Knizia?!?  The game is almost bi-polar.  I feel like the army building portion is careful, thoughtful and strategic ... and then the combat is just quick, silly fun.  Weird, but a likable weird.

Not bad.  Not great, but not bad.  It's a light dice-rolling battle game that produces some fun.  Shows its age for sure.  Too light for me and too long for what it is.  For Trade.

As others have said, a dicefest.  But it's entertaining enough;  good game when your brain's tired and you need some relatively mindless entertainment, which is what this is.  Also - IF you're a 13-year old boy playing with your 13-year old buddies, you'll probably think it's a fantastic game!

Players form teams of gladiators, then proceed to throw lots of dice to try and "capture" the opposing team members and beasts.  The formation of the teams influences how many, and when, the dice are tossed.  Initially doubtful about this one, but it does draw the players in.  Half way through everyone's beating their chests and getting feisty.  All in all, good fun.

RATING: 4
Decent King-of-the-Hill combat game. Plenty of dice, not too cerebral but fun nonetheless. Good starter game for non-gamers with testosterone. A bit conflicted, as it is very balanced and Euro-ized, but lacks the hack-n-slash you'd expect in a combat game. Probably better than people give it credit for. I sense some sour grapes from people wo expect too much just because of the designer...

Kind of a neat idea.  Build a team of gladiators and watch them fight.  It seemed like you had to make too many decisions in a game that relied so heavily on dice.  Don't think I'll put myself through this one again.  (Note... I also lost very badly the first time I played this.)

RATING: 6
An interesting Knizia design. Probably not one of his best, but there is more strategy here than others seem to think (much as in his game Africa). Sure, Clash of the Gladiators is dice heavy, but it's all about calculated risk and playing the odds. The game does seem just a bit too long for what it offers. Part of what makes an otherwise good game into a great game is the length; it needs to end leaving you wanting more. While this game is not overly long, it feels about 10-15 minutes longer than it needs to be.

Whether my rating goes up or down over time will depend on whether there are more subtle strategies to uncover, and whether the game will stand up to repeated plays.

UPDATE: After half a dozen plays, I'm not seeing much in the way of new strategies. Maybe a new opponent could clean my clock, though. Knizia games typically offer more depth than is apparent. The question here is: how much depth is left that hasn't become apparent after 6 plays?

I own the English version (Clash of the Gladiators), not the German. The saving grace of this game is two-fold: It's a gladiatorial fighting game; it accomodates 2-5 players. Otherwise, it has been a disappointment to me. There just are few strategic/tactical decisions beyond the initial setup. I really wanted this game to be great. It isn't. Perhaps some variable rules allowing tactical movement, etc. would spice it up.

Played 1 time. Dicefest with a great theme. It is nearly utter chaos, but the board looks neat, and I can see 8 year old boys thinking this is the best game ever made. Players assemble their different gladitor teams with different abilities then begin the attacks! Simple, fun.

RATING: 7
Excellent game with a surprising share of strategy for what seems like a regular run of the mill dicefest.  Not so.  Tons of decisions at every turn and oh the agony of the team building.  Slowly revealing your options while adjusting to your opponents' is a really neat setup feature.  Tons of fun and highly replayable.  I think this must scale perfectly too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only one five player game but it was really fun.  Dice game, setup then attrition.  The game gets better towards the end when players can control the animals and eat people.  The endgame was interesting.  Most of it is dice, so if you hate dice stay far away.  I happen to enjoy it, but I'm not dying to get it out again.  It takes a bit longer than I like for an attrition type game.

RATING: 8
[Gladiators, Dice, Combat] [5P:8, 4P:8, 3P:8] It's a theme-rich dicefest, but it's certainly not devoid of strategy, tactics or meaningful decisions. Should be a top-shelf dice game. This is the game that Titan should have been if it had been designed with Euro sensibilities (i.e., much shorter, more playable, no extraneous chrome, and eliminated players have something to do). You can throw that old clunker away now. After a couple of initial plays, we're clearly undervaluing the shieldbearers. They're really annoying, especially when you're down to one or two attack dice. Note to self - draft shieldbearers early. More comments to follow. *** (Impulse buy - Knizia+HiG too hard to resist. I remembered that CotG had good comments from some of my Geekbuddies, too (Farrell, cornjob, Gola?). Besides, the theme rocks! I can tolerate dice in this kind of game. Actually, dice are appropriate for this kind of game. Are my RPG roots showing? :)  )

This is a fun roll'em to kill'em game.  Although the roll of the dice will inevitably frustrate most, there are decisions here that can greatly influence your odds.  The five gladiator types offer enough diversity in strategy that choosing the right combination, in marriage with choosing the right battles will help buffer the punches luck never pulls.  The ability to still add victory points by reincarnating as animals is a nice touch and keeps all players involved.  Knizia has taken a vacation here from burning your brain, but Gladiators isn't in any sense mindless.

Pleasant time-filler. The rules are not very complex but still unnecessarily complex if you take into the account the amount of pure luck involved. Nice idea allows eliminated players to play as the arena animals and get more points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Just an all out fun game. Yes, it's a dice fest, but choosing your gladiator teams and brawling it out with the other players and the wild animals is just plain fun.

The componets are nicely made and suit the purpose of the game. Although it would be awesome with some mini figures. You could always add your own.

Game play is fast with hardly any down time at all. The game also plays pretty quick and would make a decent filler or just a quick game of fun, for those times when not in the mood for something heavy.

There isn't much strategy. Other than choosing your gladiators and where to place them and the dice add a lot of luck to the game, but being a gamer myself. I still enjoyed the game and look forward to many more plays.

Oh almost forgot. One really fun thing is there is no player elimination. Even if all your gladiators are knocked out. You then can take control of any of the animals on the board and seek revenge on those that knocked you out in the first place.

Kill me will ya??? Well take three hits from this beastly bear you bastard. Lmao, fun game check it out.

RATING: 7
With the right crowd, this is a splendid dice game of gladiator combat - complete with the hooting, hollering & wishing for better rolls that makes up a great dice game. With the wrong crowd, it devolves into odds calculations and slow play... and dies right there on the table. (Yes, I've played it both ways.)

Yes its heavy on luck. But designing teams of gladiators offer some not so obvious decisions. After that, all game long you have to choose the combat which  present the better odds for your teams, comparing to your adversaries

I like the first part of the game where you draft your gladiators and put them into teams - some real strategy there as you respond to what others are doing or try to force them to respond to you...however, there is too much luck of the roll in the second half when you actually start to fight each other. Neat idea, but the second half needs some more to pull me back. It is nice that players who are eliminated are allowed to fight as animals after elimination and can still get points that way (although they do not get a chance to get points via defense/battle back).

A fun dice-game that really has more to it than rolling dice.  How you build up your teams make for some interesting decisions.  After the teams are made, then you get to see how it all goes down!  Yes, there are dice, but there is more to this one than meets the eye.  Plus, the game makes for some dramatic moments and interesting sound effects with the right group.  If I had one complaint, I think the box art is pretty bad.  The game components are quite nice.

When I played, I looked forward to dying, just so I could use the wild animal characters to attack. I'm not against dice games...just this one. - EDIT - This comment was made years ago. I was probably extra-hard on the game simply because I had a particularly bad game of dice rolling. probably wasn't fair of me to bash the game for my bad luck. :)

RATING: 6
Much better and more tactical with 4-5 players. If only 2 are playing there's no shortage of different gladiators to choose from during setup (with 4-5 players you must decide which gladiators to get and when - before the other players get them) and the game ends as a dicefest... A not so good game from Knizia....

Why does this game have such a low rating?

This is Knizia's ameritrash game. You create bands of fighters and send them against each other with special pwoers and lots of dice rolling.

And guess what? It really works. It is balanced enough to give you reasonable choices but it really is all about the fighting.

Twelve plays. A fun beer and pretzels game. I like it best with three players; it moves along nice and quickly, which is what you want with a luck-heavy dice game, and you don't have the problem of people dog-piling on wounded teams. The two- and four-player games work pretty well too. I'd avoid it with five.

I did some analysis of the odds involved, incidentally, and the net casters are much better than they might seem at first glance.

Exactly what I expected after reading the rules, and exactly what I wanted. The people who complain that there are no significant decisions probably don't realize that most of the interesting choices happen during setup, and then you're mostly watching the results unfold; but while doing so, you get to kill bears with dice. If that doesn't sound nifty to you, move along, there's nothing for you here.

Wow, a Knizia game that I dislike!  It was bound to happen -- the man has made so many games!  I really hate games that are dependent on dice rolls, and that's what this one is.  Hard to win when opponents roll double hits and you roll blanks.

I guess I'd play this over Risk -- it's mercifully short, and even when you're dead, you get a chance to earn points by playing as the animals...

A big time dicefest where the strategy - choosing your gladitors - is completely finished before the first dice are rolled.  After that, it&#039;s simply a matter of picking on the weakest opponent you can get to.  If this was shorter, it would make a pretty good filler.  As it is, it&#039;s something to play when you want a VERY light game.

Gladiatorial combat in ancient Rome. Unlikely Knizia game featuring lots of dice (nothing inherently wrong with that) and surprisingly little strategy or tactics. Slight thinking involved during setup, but after that it's basically a mindless beat-up-on-the-others game. I think this is the most disappointingly dull Knizia game I've ever tried...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
6 - Ok game, some fun or challenge at least, will play sporadically if in the right mood. **CLASH OF THE GLADIATORS** 

The theme is captured pretty well. If you don't like the idea of violence then you won't get this one as it represents violence in the pits of Rome...man against man against beast. It's last team  standing...it's dust, clashing swords, spears lashing out, nets in the air, bound man and beast, it's thumbs up or thumbs down, it's the reason for the Colleseum (I'll be spelling that correctly once I figure it out)...really it's moving cardboard bits around and rolling dice so don't freak out. It's a numbers game and a playing of the odds.

This is an pretty fun game. Not as bad as its ratings may imply. It's in the family of Kinza games that include: Fish Eat Fish. The mechanics are simliar. There is strategy in setting up your teams and how you attack. First emiliniated players get to take over animals and still get points. Fun, light, and worth a chance for a good price. It's a dice game, but I think it still has got a bit to it even so.  I have enjoyed it as a tweener game (betwixt others).

I was a fan of this as a 3 or 4 player game...  6 players, however...  makes this outstay it's welcome by an hour or so.   I dislike that staying alive in the arena really has no advantage.  
Basically this is a dice-fest where you pick on the weak and stay away from animals if you can.  Later in the game when eliminated players are playing animals, play really degrades, as people with low points throw more 2 pt. animals in the path of players that likely have more points anyway.   Length of setup is also rather annoying.  OK as a light end game on game night for 3 or 4 players.   Btw:  it's fun to imitate the facial expressions on the gladiators...

A dice fest is fine with me. I like dice fests. But this one was ponderous and limped along like a wounded beast. 

Players control teams of gladiators with various dice modification powers. However, in trying to deal with player elimination, it made the game drag and players lost interest.

Meh.

What the hell?  I don't usually mind dice-fests, but this game is only about determining odds and checking the results.  The game doesn't reward players that are able to stay alive as the points earned by keeping on are nothing compared to what you can get by getting killed early and using an animal.  It was a nice idea, but it drags on way too long.

An absolute dicefest with a few different characters to add some strategic elements.  Also, choosing which opponent to attack makes a difference.  It really comes down to dice rolls, however, and it's fun to play once in a while but lasts a bit too long for my taste.  Doesn't seem like a Knizia game-more like mindless fun.  At least you can't say there isn't player interaction!

Lots of dice rolling. Which can be good, can be bad. Don't expect to have complete control over your fate. However, for a dice heavy game, it seems neat. A definite plus is the play time, which is nice and short. I'd play this again, even though I normally steer clear of dicefests.

An excellent demonstration of Dr. Knizia's ability to focus and tune his design to accomplish a certain goal.  This game does one thing - a sluggathon by rolling to-hit dice - and it does that well.  In this game, you roll to-hit dice and collect dead bodies, to your heart's desire.  There is some strategy, but ultimately (apparently?) it is the performance of your athletes (i.e. the combat dice) rather than the manager's decisions which determines the winner.  The rule that eliminated players can keep on playing as animals keeps everybody involved until the end, and seems to be the favorite part of the game for many players.  Personally I'd prefer to play something more strategic (such as Puerto Rico or DVONN), but objectively this game is good for players who love the thing which this game is set out to accomplish (i.e. dice-fest combat).

Any game that rewards agression instead of passive play always gets a plus as well.  Just beware of the three net bearer group.... they are ridiculous.  There is a delicate fine line in this game.  You want to destroy opponents(for points) but you need your people to be alive to defeat them.  It creates a very nice balance in drafting your team between offense and defense.  Its not about being the last one standing, its about creating the most carnage.  Fun fun filler material.  Gets such a bad rap around here for no reason.  I suspect my rating would rise with more plays.... but unfortunately it won't happen.

Dice- not many dice games get multiple plays by me. Cool theme though.

Definately fun ideas.  But runs on too long with too little game decision challenge.

Fun game, but I think I'll play it mostly with kids, as the almost-all luck game may turn off some adults.  It is fun to get into the spirit, though.

Love the idea of assembling your own gladiator teams. Like the components. After setup, however, there is not much of a game left. Just a lot(!) of dice throwing. It is OK to play with my 6 year old son though.

A "not serious" but highly playable and entertaining game on "Those who are about to die".
Artwork is a bit "fairy prince" on certain gladiators. Resulting in more laughs. Beer and food will "add" to the enjoyment of this game.

I'm not the first to call it a dicefest and I won't be the last.  OK, to play someone else's copy from time to time, but I see no reason to buy it myself.

Okay, so it isn't rocket science. Good little dicefest which is enchanced by a team construction element. It may say two to five players but I wouldn't play with less than three. The two player game is strictly snooze-ville. Player interaction, while not deep, is fairly constant and, not to mention, crucial.Due to its clear theme, this game seems ideal for non-gamers intimidated by heavy abstract strategies. Fun filler fracas!

Another Knizia.  A good "beer and pretzels" light dice rolling, combat game.  Toughest part is probably drafting your teams.

Good, fun, light, dice rolling, arena combat game. Reiner Knizia does Ameritrash.

This is a weird game that gives you some semblance of control over the second half of the game by having you pick your teams in the first half, but in the end, the game still comes down to the die roll every single turn.  It's interesting (What can I say?  I love rolling dice!), but nothing I say here is going to change anyone's opinion of the game and its randomness.  There are definitely some tactics that are optimal, but if you can't roll the critical hits at the right time, then you won't win the game.

This is quite fun considering the simple mechanics.  It's a dice-game but the tactics and army-design is awesome.  Try the 3 netcasters with one sword--he's fun.

Knizia game that manages to both be a typical Knizia game while at the same time being an atypical Knizia game. Build your gladiators and fight.

RATING: 5
Seems like every player tries to create nearly the same teams and only when certain gladiator chits run out do differences appear.  I also think it's bunk that a player who has lost all his units can still score with the random wild animals.  Too many dice, not enough maneuvering, and too dang many wild animals rushing in from the peanut gallery.

I actually bothered to build a goofy little simulator just to see if there really are interesting choices under the hood here, as I had my doubts.  I think that for most folks this will be nothing more than weighted roshambo with arbitrary kingmaking.

999 Games edition picked up in Belgium. Language independent pieces and rules easily remembered after just one play make this an ideal holiday game bargain!
 Light filler game, probably won't see much play (if any) now we're back home...

Fast paced, easy to learn game is fun for kids or adults in a partying mood.  Player decisions will affect the outcome to some extent, but the dice results are more important.  Something about the design of the dice makes it hard to keep them on the table...I've never seen so many rolls hit the floor in any game.  Fun in the right circumstances.

I have no idea why this is so poorly regarded. I think this is a great, light, fun and fast-moving game. Nice series of light decisions and just enough tension (and excitement watching the dice and odds) that I find it quite engaging. Underrated - perhaps because Knizia is usually associated with more mathematical and "precise" games?

RATING: 6
Pretty much a full on dicefest... but it's certainly got some strategy in there too.  Not the best Knizia game out there, but still enjoyable.

Fun little Gladiator game.  It is a dice game, so the random factor of rolling dice limits the strategy you can do.  The fun of this game is trying to assemble the "pefect" gladiatoral team.  But that team depends on what your fellow players are choosing.

GAME: Classic Warlord
RANK: 4297

RATING: 7
A fun, simple and elegant game that doesn't last too long if you employ a simple variant - give a certain number of cities needing to be taken to win the game - somewhere between 12 and 15 depending on how many are playing.

It plays like a cross between Vinci (without the civ tiles), Risk, Liar's Dice and "nuke your neighbour for fun."

You'd think that any game that allowed you to have nuclear exchanges at will must be in bad taste, but actually this game is partly tongue in cheek.  It's light and not meant to be taken seriously.  You've only got to look at those silly white rockets which you build ever higher to see that.

Nice game.  Lots of entertainment and I reckon that it's a bit of a semi-hidden gem - a lot of folks here who've never played it would love it.

I have both Warlord and its 'offspring' Apocolypse. The 2 games are very similar, but Warlord is the longer game, simply because of the bigger board. The Apocolypse rules are far more polished (& shorter).

RATING: 7
Diplomacy with nuclear weapons?

Elegant rules (almost as minimalistic as Diplomacy), classy components (beautifully designed map). The new rule on the acquisition of an h-bomb after using an a-bomb has made the classic game even better.

One of the first games that really fired our imagination.
The creative use of dice in the combat phase totally
inspired us to make our own version" World War 3"
Made our own world wide map and thanks to David at
Clever Mojo Games we got rockets to finally pimp this
game up to maximum level. This game screams out for a
remake. For real world dominance this game takes the cake. If you`ve never tried this type of battle system
with concealing your attack strength on your dice you`ve
been missing out on some tense gaming moments.

RATING: 10
Classic design, brilliant combat system. One of my favourite games ever in a shiny new version. Terrific played with 3 or 4. We played Apocalypse with 5 back in the day using the reverse of the nuke hits as counters. I should also mention the unbelievable service from Mike and Mary Hayes in supplying my copy. Extra materials were provided based on my feedback to emails asking about my history of playing the game. This is a classic game you should own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A long-standing favourite.  The shortest rules I have seen mask a deceptively rich game, and the bluff (and commitment) needed to successfully attack and set up the next attack does add to the tension.

RATING: 6
Played 20+ Played 2&3&6 player 3+ hours. Played the Apocalypse version many times, mainly 3 player. I played the Warlord version once with 6 players. Not played for about 20 years. The memories are good. Clever simple rules. The game is balanced to the extent that alert players could keep a game running a long time unless they team up to eliminate players. September 04

*UPDATE* I have brought the newly released version of Warlord. Played a couple of single board 2 player games and can't wait to try this with more boards and players. Now we have H bombs and players start in mountain spaces. These rule changes all look good to me. May 2013

*UPDATE* Played a much anticipated 4 player game over 2 boards. It took around 3 hours. The end game stodged down into an effort to lock the dominant player behind a wall of radiation. Rather than playing out the final turns they were theorised over. I'm writing this the following day and on reflection I think we tried to call the game too early. All told it was a rather disappointing experience. I'm lowering my rating to a 6 but hope to play the game again soon and get a happier play experience. May 2013

*UPDATE* I set in motion and partly observed a 4 board 3 player game which took 7 hours to reach a conclusion. Again the players were ultimately separated by a nuclear wasteland running down the middle of Europe with no one able to take a decisive victory. The players, 3 twenty year olds, had a blast. I don't feel I can justify raising my rating but it is only fair to note that given the right circumstances this game provides a full on experience never to be forgotten. July 2013

Mike Hayes deluxe reprint
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game needs to be reprinted but use a Variant ruleset that turns a good game into an amazing Game.

Bob Roscow has developed a ruleset that makes each player select a colour from a bag until all players have selected a colour not of there own (their Objective). All of this is hidden. Once complete the winner of the game is the person who defeats their objective.

As you can imagine this puts another aspect on the game of diplomacy and trust, is yor neighbour trying to kill you and who should I protect, have cunning can I be by showing someone im their ally and then attcking once the nukes have me at an advantage.

Also the Hidden Dice combat has changed. A player takes a Die and decide how many units will attack, the opponent does the same and tries to guess.... this may seem hard but beleive me it can be quite easy to guess what another is trying to do.

My edition titled Apocalypse
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The only luck is in the setup - after that it's all decided by the players, even though dice play an integral part of the game.  For a multi-player wargame, it's one of the best, with elegant, smooth, streamlined mechanics that emphasise skill over random acts of violence.

Although, being able to nuke London from the other side of Europe is one of the best bits of the game.

Play until someone gets and keeps a majority of the board rather than total destruction for a shorter and more involving game for all players.

RATING: 7
This game was played over and over in my very old gaming group. Lots of reverse psychology and psych outs were present over the whole guess my number combat system. A very simple risk like game where only the initial setup is left to chance - everything else is in your control. Combat is settled by your opponent attempting to guess the number you have chosen on a die - the catch, you can only pick numbers less than or equal to the army size in the area, and if your number is guessed, you lose that many casualties. Success means you can move that many units into a captured territory. And theres no immediate extra reshuffling moves, so, choose those numbers wisely. But not too predictably. All in all this makes number selection critical, and subject to much bluff and double bluff. The nerves of some generals were known to crack and simply resort to rolling the dice for their attack so the defender could not 'read' the attacker. Not a great idea tho.
And building and using those nukes is always very satisfying.
The netherlands seemed to get nuked perpetually. Poor lowlands. Take that you high earning area !
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Similar in style to Risk with only a 4 page rulebook, and no rolling of dice, but with really cool plastic nukes that get higher and higher (and thus can go further and further) as you win battles. This is a fun beer and pretzels game.

RATING: 7.7
This is an amazing design. Simple rules and very destructive, aggressive gameplay. Also, the combat system is very unique - I'm wondering that it doesn't seem to be very common. If you like simple wargames this might just be for you.

RATING: 4.6
Your typical light wargame from the 70's-80's. You end up with one player getting really powerful then everyone nukes them to be replaced by the next superpower who gets nuked, thus goes the chain for several hours. If you are the last player to go you are typically screwed. If you don't get a random allotment of cities fairly close to each other you are also screwed. 

Good points include the clever combat mechanic and nukes that get better as you build them up. I kind of like the map too. This game would have been great back in the school years when you just didn't care but these days only pull it out if people are threatening to play Risk.

Love the game though a shortened set of victory conditions (such as 50% of cities) will speed the game along as playing to total destruction of all opponents will take a long time.

I have been playing versions of Warlord since 1969, and regard it as the ultimate board game.  Having used many maps (mostly home made) and many rules variants, I have no hesitation in saying that 'Classic Warlord' is the best version.  The hors d'oeuvres of the starting procedure (with echos of the oriental game 'Go'), occupying the mountains is a superb introduction to the main course, giving valuable insight into other players' intentions before any blood is shed.    Highly recommended.

Rating from a 20-year old memory.  I do enjoy this game and very much wish I had a copy.  Design is fine, though the game is long.  Like a working version of Risk.  The nukes are a blast (no pun intended) and the build/combat refinements over Risk work very well.

A terrific game: Risk /without/ the luck (dice rolling replaced with an ingenious stake and bluffing system) and /with/ nuclear missiles! (what could possibly go wrong...)  
The new "Classic" edition is improved and plays quicker thanks to map and rule updates that prevent too much tit-for-tat, repeat forever play.  Scales down to 2 players on one board section in not much over an hour.
I reviewed this for Counter #60

RATING: N/A
Only recently played this 2012 update, but the original prototype version of this Risk-variant from the 1970s has always proved a sure-fire hit with both gamers and non-gamers alike. Combat uses a dice, but there is no dice-rolling - just poker-style bluffing. Successful attacks are 'rewarded' with a nuclear missile, which can often prove to be as much a liability as an asset, and which leads to an entertainingly chaotic mid-to-end game.

(GW Apocalypse) Finally played after years on the shelf. Simple wargame with good incentives to attack rather than dig in, so there's lots of combat all over the board. Not sure if I'm impressed with the double guessing combat routine. It seems like a good idea, but in practice, it was underwhelming, if not frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Games Workshop edition.  Innovative, tense but fun combat system with a psychological dimension, as you try to second-guess your opponents.  In this game you don't get to roll the die for your attacks - you choose which face you want to be uppermost, limited only by the number of attacking pieces at your disposal, e.g. if attacking with 4, you can choose any number between one and four.  Your opponent then tries to guess which one you have chosen.  This makes it hard to play against my wife, who seems to have no difficulty in reading my mind, while I can never discern any pattern in her choices.  The nuclear rocket mechanism is interesting, too, and creates a lot of tension as the rocket's range and potential number of targets increase with every new stage.  It's a light wargame quite a bit of strategic depth, but the element of bluff makes it a lot more fun than most others in the genre. This game is too good to disappear - it deserves to be reissued.

RATING: 9
I grew up on this.  In retrospect this was the game that introduced me to real gaming, and was really a pre-euro, euro classic.  Fabulous mechanics, and so innovative at the time that it is still a standard bearer.

I have the blue version I bought when I was 15. Dog-eaten after so many plays.

Ps I have played 50+ games but never fully finished one (not a fair reflection on the game as it's clear well before end who will inevitably win)

This rating is based on Classic Warlord in the golden box. So much to think about; where to attack how much to commit to attack and where to place the missiles. Then there are the missiles; two types even more dilemmas. An intense game on one small board and still there is the as yet unmet urge to play on one giant 8 piece mapboard. Superb.

This game flashed us strongly! An absolutely brilliant mix of diplomacy and bluffing without any luck! Reminded us of other superb wargames like "Diplomacy". The theme is crude with all these A- and H-bombs. But the atmosphere is sooo tense, so heartbumping, so mean ... just wow! Simple rules and an ingenious battle mechanism (What do you think? With how many armies is your enemy attacking? With how many armies does your enemy have other plans? And what are these plans?) lead to the one and only result: this game is a blast! Invaded my top ranked games like a rocket.

Unique combat involving guessing the attacker's chosen number (limited by units available).  Produces some intense second-guessing and bluffing.

I think my main concern with Classic Warlord was that it seemed pretty obvious who was going to win long before they eventually did (even with a resignation in the end).

Beyond that though, it was a smooth playing game of conflict and area control. It didn't wow me, but I'd happily give it another go sometime soon.

Much better than risk.  Love the missiles.  Just recently played again, 3 player (3.5 hours).  First time in over 25 years. 

Victory: Player wins if he has 12 cities at the start of his turn (3 player), or 10 for 4 player.

The combat is a great mechanic.  It is a bit fiddly with the chits but great, deep gameplay. 

Good solid old skool game.

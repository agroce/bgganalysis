Notes from the perspective of a Middle School Game Club:

Extremely popular at our game club. Very thematic (and they love Star Wars), quick to learn/play, and action packed. One student brought in the Transformers game which shares the same battle system, and they combined the two. They loved that.

RATING: 6.5
Cool defines this game if you're a Star Wars fan. Great little pieces and tight rules. All it needs is some Jar-Jar Binks fodder to slice up!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
Fun, light, easy to learn and play Star Wars skirmish game. Each character has their own deck, which is a cool way to differentiate their strengths. A great lighthearted, fun, easy to play Star Wars game that allows any number of players to sit down and talk some Star Wars smack while repeating cheesy Star Wars quotes.

And if you want, you can play without the minor characters by removing/ignoring their cards from a deck; easy.

Epic Duels is a fast and fun miniatures battle game. Play quickly, laugh a lot and enjoy it for the ride. I'd really like to try a six player free-for-all battle... that might be where this sort of game really shines.

RATING: 5
Ok, this offers a relatively fast paced but somewhat shallow experience. Does not offer too much replay or novelty value either. The best part is that you get a the Star Wars theme and a lot of action. However, there are very few meaningful decisions in the game, since the number of cards you can play each turn is very limited and they do not offer that many trade-offs. Moreover, you find yourself quite often in a situation where the cards in your hands  basically leave you no choice.

The bottom line is that this is fun but only as a past time activity. This is no game for gamers to get excited about.

Imperial Assault for kids, before Imperial Assault existed! Still have it. My son played it to death back in the day. Game is fun enough, but it's really a very simplistic skirmish game. The cards do help mix it up. Should eBay it probably ... SOLD BGG Auction July 2017.

RATING: 7
A nice, fun game, There is definitely a lack of balancing of the characters, but things can change if you increase the number of players (the Fetts, for example, are much more useful as part of large groups). Simple to learn, and very easy to get people to play if they enjoy Star Wars in the slightest... Also one of the few games my wife will play!

Beautiful bits and a nice board for a game that has so little going for it.  It's very random and luck-based.  Requires little strategy and has cards that amount to "you win" on them.  I had higher hopes.  It would be a "5" if it didn't cost so much.  I don't know why that bugs me so much, since I didn't even buy it.

This is great!  It's great fun to put on a soundtrack recording in the background.  I would love to see an expansion with more maps, models, and cards.  More cards are needed.

This game has simple mechanics, enough differences between the characters, and has all of the main characters from Star Wars. The only quibble is the lack of cards, but I bought a couple more and now the decks are a bit more filled out. It now enjoys being the number one game among my elementary and junior high school students.

What a great game. Plenty of scope to employ your strategic skills to add or to overcome luck. Personally felt it plays best with 3 players. Loads of what ifs can be played out. Yesterday i was Darf Vader against Obi one and Yoda. They beat me of course but it was a close call. Theres loads of life in this game due to the ample amount of different characters you can play with and their unique cards. Brilliant game misses a 10 only because it doesn't have solitaire rules. I'm going to buy another copy incase the current one wears out!

This game is just flat out a lot of fun to play. You can make it as long or short as you'd like, play different numbers of characters per player (even unequal numbers for each player), partner up in any combination of players/characters, and create house rules on number of actions per turn and so on. This really is a good game to explore the Star Wars Universe, and it feels like a really good fit to the theme.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Well designed kid's game that rewards good tactics, card management, and bluffing.  Much better than Memoir '44 or Battlecry!  Some matchups are more unbalanced than others, but this was intended for kids, so who cares!  Personally, I think a Jedi should be more powerful than a bounty hunter.

Not only the best 'Star Wars' game - it is one of those games I always would like to play. Simple combination of easy-tabletop and CCG rules. Lots of opportunities to quote from the films. I just don't know why Hasbro is not able to come up with an expansion (or a 'Lord of the Rings' variant)...

RATING: 6
I used to be a big fan of this game until I started playing better games.  I've only really played this in a tournament format, where the amount of people you kill are given point values, and whoever has the most points after three games is the winner.  Personally, the tournies are enjoyable because they add a meta-game that is lacking in the original rule set, and I can't imagine having much fun playing outside of that format.  So I don't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

It is possible to play this game to death, but it takes a long time. It's so hard to play just one game. This is another one of my favorite games for gamers of varying expertise. It's a must-have for Star Wars fans.

RATING: 6
If you like Star Wars you will like this game.  Good variety of characters, each of which have a unique deck of cards making some more powerful than others.  The most fun when you are familiar enough with the characters to balance them for a game.  All that and a game lasts for only 20 minutes!  My only complaint is they made Luke too weak of a character and no fun to play with, boo.

Fantastic game with huge replayability.  I like to play it against one opponent with each person playing characters.  The game can run long for what it is when played with to many people.  Most games, however, are quick and fun.

Simple, fun, fast and easy to learn. Let's play! There are clearly more powerful choices of characters- in this way it's true to the films. It makes a perfect filler or a hardy main course depending on how many sessions you play and with which crowd.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's hard to put into words how disappointed I was by this game.  I looked forward to it, because people said that it was another good game created out of the Star Wars universe.  I love Star Wars, and I really looked forward to the idea of making unusual match-ups that you could never see in the movies.  But this game was just a disaster.

There is a massive amount of luck in the game.  If you draw better cards than your opponent you can easily crush them.  And to make matters worse, the Jedi actually become the weaker characters because they have to catch-up to their opponents and be next to them.  So characters with guns can run around like little chickens and take shots from across the board slaughtering Jedi left-and-right.  BAD game, don't get your hopes up!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I was surprised how much I like this one.  The sheer number of characters/card decks make each play unique.  Add to this a thriving net community, with new cards, boards, and rules, and this game is a lot bigger than the package.  There are some balance issues with certain charaters; I think this is intentional and appropriate (e.g. Darth Maul SHOULD be more powerful than Han), but this information should be provided, so a new player knows that his character is slightly handicapped.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good Fun! Got it in 2004 as a gift, new, for $30. Can't believe what it sells for now! If you tire of the maps it comes with, buy the Halo Interactive Strategy board game and use it's terrain. It's grids work perfect for SW ED.
I'm not sure but I might rate this a little lower if not for the SW theme. Count Doodoo is lame in this game as he is in the movies! lololol

I loved this game but it has definitely played itself out. It is really a card game. The board and movement aren't very important. I played this game a lot and had fun with it but it really should have come with a second set of advanced rules for the experience player.

This is, by far, the best Star Wars board game ever released. [Update: Comes second to X-wing and I haven't played The Queen's Gambit]

The card mechanics work very nicely and are well balanced between the characters. Complexity can rise greatly is each player takes on the responsibilities for multiple main characters.

Good for anyone over age 9.

RATING: 7
Fun, but not at all balanced.  Plays like an exercise in luck, but still a blast because my group tends to really get into the theme.  I know it'd be a lower rating for me if I was playing with random people.

Based solely on the gameplay, it probably should be a 4.

RATING: 6
This is an ultra light tactical game set in the Star Wars universe.  It's basically a kids game and it's very quick to teach and play.  I really like that each character has their own deck and there are some really cool thematic cards.  The card play is the heart of the game and moving the pieces around is secondary.  There aren't a lot of obstacles and maneuvering and positioning isn't a large part of the game.  You are basically either trying to get out of range to regroup or run in to attack and battles often become slugfests.  Still, for what this is, it's pretty cool and it definitely fills a niche.

Nice enough, but Star Wars minis are more flexible and considerably less expensive.  Will play other people's copies, but won't buy my own unless I can do so for under $20.

Decent filler and scales pretty well from 2-6.  But it is still just a filler and also suffers in comparison to Queen&#039;s Gambit, which I think is excellent.

RATING: 7
Rated for the 4 player game (two-player games difficult to balance, three- player game too random). Gut-wrenching decisions on which cards to play make for interesting outcomes. 4 different boards allow for some variety. We've had some challenging tournaments with dream teams going against each other. Mace and Anakin turned out to be the ultimate dream team, barely beating out the Emperor and Vader in a best of seven match, 4-3. Lost my second copy to the trash during a clean up day headed by my wife.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I've finally upgraded this to a 10. Epic Duels has surprised me with its staying power - I never seem to get tired of it. It's a perfect mix of light strategy and luck. The individual decks are pure genius, like Heroscape with strategic card play instead of dice.

Add the Star Wars theme and the colorful presentation, and it's *exactly* what I want when I feel like smashing my friends.

I finally found a used copy of this game in a bookstore and could not be happier. I just wish they would have put out more content for the game. Still, there are a lot of fan additions to the game to add continued replayability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Epic Duels was a fun and interesting Star Wars miniatures game that ended up being eclipsed by Star Wars Miniatures.  It uses a relatively simple card driven engine and limited board to good effect, and, as a stand alone game, does a fair job of creating little Star Wars duels, but comes up a bit light on the "epic" side of things.

I think this game is a little over-rated. I have played it a lot because my young kids like to play it and so do I. I think if it had bigger play maps it would be better.

Not a bad game at all, but the "free-for-all" game really sucks. A lot. I think the team game (2-on-2 is ideal, 3-on-3 is OK but can be a touch slow) is the one to play. Definitely falls into the "stupid game" category as there isn't a whole lot of strategy or tactics, but it does have an OK "fun factor" - but precious little repeat value. Nice variety in the characters also, the teams are all rather different and run a nice spectrum.

Unbalanced characters, whacky powers, and ultimately way too simple.  This plays out as a crazy beat'em up akin to a neutered version of King of Tokyo (not similar gameplay, just feel).  I was not a fan and it was too over-the-top and nonsensical for me.  Also didn't appreciate player elimination which caused people to have to sit out for quite awhile.

Possibly the best $30 that I ever spent on gaming stuff.

Hilarious and quick gameplay that feels just like the characters that it is supposed to represent.

It would get a "10" only for the fact that I find that the secondary characters mildly awkward.

If you can get this game for a reasonable price and have even the slightest interest in Star Wars then you should definitely go for it.

"Epic" is probably not the word I would use to describe this game... There isn't really a lot of decisions to be made in this game. However, I must admit that I could see it being pretty funny if played with 6 friends all vs. all - and with a beer and a lot of trashtalk! As a filler I guess it's okay and I would probably play again if asked, although reluctantly.

A good game that's both fun, and just challenging enough to be interesting.  The matchups possible lend the game a great replayability.

My experience with the game is playing it with kids (7-9) and both adult and child had a ball.  I can see it working for two adults as well, just don't expect ASL.

This is a pretty fun little game for what it is. If I didn't have kids, I probably wouldn't have this. But I do have kids, and my boys (especially my 7 year old) really like it. Even my 2.5 year old will play, as long as you don't hold him to any rules or anything. Oh, and he doesn't use any of the cards. And sound effects are required.

Ok, it's not the most sophisticated game; but with the right group of people it can be a blast.  The jokes from reciting each card as it is played ("Don't ever tell me the odds," "It is not wise," "I will not fight you," and "All too easy," to name a few) are awesome.  The game has reached truly epic status in my circle of friends.  Oh, and Murph, I want my sexy Padme figurine back, you little pervert.

Love it love it love it.  Have played multiple rule variants, have played a super battle with all characters and all transformers characters in a huge epic duel with self-created rules.  This game just rocks - mostly because of the nostalgic factor and emotions that are tied in to the movies (and I didn't even like Episode I or II) and the way in which the character cards really do capture the feel of the characters from the movies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The cards are amazingly poor, considering the nice little painted miniatures. The various decks certainly don't give off any kind of vibe of having been play-tested or that they are intended to be balanced. Still, it can be fun to play...because its Star Wars.  But if you're going to be irritated by imbalance don't bother. Where was this game when I was 10?

I'm trying to reacquire a copy of this game for a Christmas gift for my son. I'd accept a used copy in good condition.

RATING: 7
(Kid's Game)

Make no mistake, this is a fairly light game and it doesn't have much in the way of balance, but if you're in the mood for some fast, card driven, Star Wars themed beat-em-up action, then Epic Duels is a good box to take down from the shelf. 

The premise of the game is simple, players each choose 1 or more characters from the Star Wars universe, they pick a battle ground, and then they duke it out with a card driven system. Each character has their own deck of cards, and said cards generally seem to have thematic integrity. Movement is dice driven (a random factor) and the order that the cards come to you is also random enough to be a determining factor in who wins, but the bottom line is that I just didn't care about all of that while I was playing...the game evokes SW well, and the play is so fast that a rematch is an easy solution to a silly result.

I do not think that the game is worth what it is currently going for (over 50$ USD) but if you run across it in a thrift shop it's definitely worth picking up...at least if you're a Star Wars fan.

With a _little_ added complexity, this could be a 10.  As it stands, it's a great slugfest even if it is unbalanced.  I love how the box makes it such a big deal that Mace Windu can fight Vader.  Best game you can buy at Wal Mart!

A light diversion. There has been a lot of talk about strategy and play balance. However to be honest if it weren't for the strong movie tie in I doubt this game would have gotten much attention. As a card game there is a lot of luck. Here is the strategy guide: Play your best cards while you have them. In team play some characters are better in the back some in the front. Some characters are better with a large hand others it doesnt matter. Most importantly concentrate your firepower as any good wargamer could tell you. Don't get me wrong I bought the game and have had fun but I don't think this one will last long.

Simply Fun! Other games are probably 'better' games, and certainly more challenging. The main criticism is that the characters aren't balanced and it is true, but the player powers and decks do capture the persona of the characters, and I'm glad the designers made that decision . Liking Star Wars is a pre-requisite for this, but this game is just fun! One of my favourites.

RATING: 6.2
This was a fun game, though I only really felt the theme since I as Count Dooku chose to fight Yoda for most of the game. Luke's "I will not fight you" special card turned out to be a serious kingmaker late in the game, but that's ok because we had some good laughs over it.

Super fun tactical, card-driven battle game.  Plus, it's Star Wars, so that's cool!  

There are improvements to be made if this were to ever be reprinted.  Movement for one, with a speed stat as a modifier.  Also, larger battlefields / more obstacles.  Third, some sort of built-in defense for force-using, melee characters against ranged attacks.

A must for any Star Wars fan. It's fun to put together the "what if?" team-ups, as well as re-create battles from the movies.

Dec. 19, 2009 -- Have barely played this in recent years, but I got it on the table with my girlfriend's oldest son last night. We played two skirmishes, and while the first one was a little one-sided, the second was a nail-biter. It could have gone either way.

Simple in its design, Epic Duels has a fun factor that is good for some quick, light carnage. I quite enjoy the individualized decks and the fast-paced action. It's not the kind of thing I would want to play all the time, as I love meatier games, but it's good for a night when I just want a quick gaming fix. Good fun. My rating stands. 7/10

Good, clean fun.  After you learn the game, though, don't play 2-player games with just two characters...use two main characters each player.

Production: The figures are great; the layout of information on the cards and mats is clear.  But the card quality, mat quality, and poor selection of images undermine what could have otherwise been a great looking game.

Play: Surprisingly fun, given my expectation for it to be just a brainless marketing ploy.  The simple yet agonizing choice of whether to draw cards or attack is enough to make it interesting for me, and the many character combinations keeps it fresh for multiple playings in one session. (1+1+3) (10 plays)

My kids and their cousins love this game.  I would be hard pressed to remember an extended family gathering where somebody didn't ask me if I brought this game.  It's a great game that never gets old.  

With more than three players, it's best played in teams, in my opinion.  Otherwise, some people might feel picked on when they get sandwiched out early.  

It's been fun to watch how my kids play this game differently as they get older and understand some of the abstractions in the game dynamics.  Little kids tend to just horde cards and try to stay away from trouble.  Then it seems like they go through a stage where they go swooping in and attack whenever they get a chance, with no thought to defending.  And then -- the best part -- when they start learning the strategy and actually start beating you, because they've figured out when it's time to attack, when it's time to hide, and how to use positioning to their advantage.

Fun game, with the ability to customize the matchups. It's quite fun to have Count Dooku go up against Darth Vader in the Emperor's Throne Room; you can let your inner ten-year-old self out and finally figure out "Who would win between...?" It came out in tandem with Episode II, so everything included there and thereafter is missing, but the game can be varied and interesting nevertheless.

I do love playing this game.  It's so very very epic...as the title states.

You do need to make sure you have an even number of players.  With an odd number, whoever has the extra character will usually win.

After playing this game once, I had to own it. Then I found out it isn't my wife's cup of tea, so I know she's being nice to me when she agrees to play. The card driven combat is simple and quick, and gives many chances to say "take that" or "not so fast". The unique character powers really compliment the theme. Some characters are more powerful, but weaker character can prevail if their powers are used effectively. The player figures are cool. It plays well with any number, but players eliminated early may sit around for a while in larger groups.

[Van Ness/Daviau] Great filler game. Really easy to hook people into this one. It is random but it's damn fun. A quick combat game that uses hand management like Battle Cry, only in 15 minutes flat. You get a faster play time and a more fun theme... what's better than that?

May be about the best Star Wars game produced.  Some of the teams and cards seem unbalanced, but with very few tweaks out there, makes it better, but even without those, still great!  May be Lucas should make more movies based on this and not the junk he has of late!

First play was a 5-player free-for-all.
I think this game is geared more for team play, that is 2 OR 4 OR 6 players (not 2 to 6 players).

Second play was a 4-player team game.
This is my preferred mode of play.

RATING: 9
Really this game is pretty goofy. It doesn't feel like Star Wars outside of the images and there are a lot of "What If" odd duel pairings. But it is light and simple and very enjoyable. It isn't a great design and by all critical measures the game is pretty weak. But the game is straight up fun. It does say that you can go higher than 2 players but really the board just starts getting crowded and reduces what is already a pretty weak tactical game as far as positioning on the board goes and just eliminates what little bit there is. So two player I feel works best.

Here is the most simple and mostly boring after 3 times Miniatures/card game. Great for kids or as a very simple intro into Miniautures type of play.

Yes, this is a flawed game - player elimination problems, simplistic gameplay, mostly random. But there's no denying that it is really, really fun. The problems of the game do come up and ensures that it's not something that you will play a lot. But on that right occasion, it's simply a blast. The simplicity makes the game easy to "pick up" and the theme, well, 'nuff said.

Picked it up in a bargain bin for dirt cheap several years ago. We were mostly playing D&D: Mini's, Heroclix, and Magic: The Gathering at the time.

Looks like that was a big mistake.

Cool game for the guys.  Not as much to it as I would have hoped, but it's fun to battle it out w/ all the different characters.  I've played one six-player game.  I might like it better with 4, as you get your turn quicker.  I'd like to try the advanced version w/ 2 characters each.

I bought this one as a kneejerk reaction after seeing it in a Toys-r-Us. My friends and I are all hopeless Star Wars geeks, and we played the hell out of this one.  Free Tip:  If your opponent is Darth Maul, do NOT let him run and hide and build up a fistload of cards.  Two words: "Sith Speed."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I think it helps to be a Star Wars fan.  Each character has their attack/defend/special card deck which closely represents their on-screen abilities.  My opponents clearly remembered the films better than I, and gained much pleasure from the character's individual actions.  The theme is indeed carried out well--I think this is the real attraction of the game.  

I thought all 4 games really lagged and became repetitious (fight, run & hide to heal & draw cards for a few rounds, return to fight), and I wanted to hurry the game along. It is a simple game (nothing wrong with that) but it just played too long.

Nice quick battle game, some of the characters seem a bit crap but there are plenty to choose from. Might get predictable after quite a few games I suspect. We have found healing 2 points per action and drawing 2 cards per action (instaed of 1) helps speed the start of the game up. Also we normally start with 2 cards

There might be other skirmish games that have used the attack/defend with cards mechanism, but this is the first I have played.  The game is quick, fun, and the fact that it's star wars just adds more flavor to us fanboys.  I and all of my gamer friends enjoy the game, and considering you get to pick up 31 painted plastic star wars minis, the $19.95 price tag is a bargain.

RATING: 7
It sure feels light, and it sort of is, but after one play I'd say it's a decent battle game with appeal factor to both kids and adults. You don't find too many mass-market asymmetrical battle games out there in the world! And this one has a Star Wars theme which probably gives it an extra point. A good amount of tension is created with the ability to only draw, play, or heal (and you can only do two on your turn). So there is some push-your-luck with card draws and card play. But overall, just a good-feeling game. LOS is really gamey though. Doesn't make any sense from a thematic standpoint. It's too bad with some clever card design that the game relies on a movement die and dumb LOS rules. Pretty childish and probably MB execs ordering such things.

RATING: 10
This game ROCKS!!! It looks great, with all the mini figures and is just a ton of fun to play. There are 4 different arenas to battle in and there's even a few different variations of game plays in the rule book.

You can even have Luke Skywalker battle it up against Yoda. All for one, one on one, team play, good vs. evil...You name it.

The componets are very nice, not the best but they look good enough and really add to the feel of the game. All characters have special abilities. It's just one big battle royal.

Game play is simple and easy to teach/learn. Most games are pretty quick, depending on the number of players, as this one can play anywhere from 2-6 players. I even went crazy and played a 12 player game, just by using a few dimes for health markers. :) It's just that much fun!

RATING: 10
Great game to simulate a duel or battle. Dice for movement (primarily), cards for attack and defend and a board to play on. A simple system that works.

Although some of the decks are unbalanced, the game mechanics are very sound. It can get a bit frustrating playing Jango vs Obi and some other matchups.  So, I created three custom expansions of my own that are much more balanced. 

Epic Jedi Battles - true 1 on 1 battles
Epic Space Battles 
Epic Ground Battles

This was my first grail game, and I found it in April 2016.

A fantastic head-to-head combat game in the spirit of the old dungeon crawlers. A lot of people go nuts over the cover art of Mace Windu fighting Darth Vader and so forth, but I'm not a Star Warrior so what gets me going is the asymmetric gameplay, the fast play time, the cleverly constructed dual-character decks, and the amazingly easy customization.

Also, every other game with miniatures on your shelf is a potential Epic Duels expansion, and you can't beat THAT!

Definitely a step down from Heroscape, but the card mechanic adds a little something different. (Yes, I know Epic Duels came out first). The Star Wars theme adds a little something extra to an already fun game.
UPDATE: This game has aged very well for me. I love playing this one with anywhere from 2-6 players. It doesn't quite have the depth and variety of Heroscape, but it can satisfy the same type of craving with a much shorter setup time and theme that draws most people in. I really like this game!

RATING: 9
Quick and fun.  A duel between 2 characters is always fun, but 2 vs. 2 is where the game really shines.  This game gets crowded and long in the 3 on 3 format (just don't play it).  The character's decks aren't balanced, but it's still fun.  Miniatures are great quality.  There is a cult following of the game for a reason, if you find it cheap at resale shop get it.  This game needs a full reprint with expansions to include more characters, Hasbro make this happen.

FUN!!! A lite  game to be sure but it's fast and addictive. The Star Wars "feel" is definitely there. Fast gameplay that's easy to teach with each character being distinctive in it's abilities. After 50+ games this hasn't gotten old or stale and I play at every opportunity.

Epic Duels is a fun and addictive hack'n'slash board game. The Star Wars theme is really essential! It makes the game a must have for SW geeks and not-so-geeks. Replay value is great since there's different arenas where to battle (it's also easy to create your own) and different characters to fight with. Unfortunately the game lacks originality as a board game. I bet not many people would play it, if it wasn't about Star Wars.

$20, and thoroughly enjoyable if you have four people (two player games are done in like 10 minutes). Being not much of a SW fan, I was looking for something that let me be characters from the movies, but not require too much knowledge of SW for it to be enjoyable...and Epic Duels turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise...its not too challenging, but at the same time you'll need some skill and a little luck to make it through as the winner. The perfect game, IMHO, for a lazy day when you don't feel like setting up anything more complicated.

Epic Duels is very much in the vein of Heroscape (not surprising given the same designers).  It's a light card-driven minis game that, while relying on luck of the draw, is quite decent.  Some characters seem to be more overpowered than others but not to the point of being broken.  Well OK, Darth Vader is broken, but you can't expect him not to be, can you?

Got this in a trade and sold on Ebay for a pretty penny when demand surged.  Just not enough there to justify a spot on the shelf I guess (especially given the monetary incentive).

RATING: 6
Am a little disappointed in this game being that the miniatures are so cool and the different effects each character can have within their decks I thought I would enjoy it more. But I found the small playing boards meant anyone shooting with ranged weapon just tried to sneak around perimeter of the map. I will try a few more times using different characters maybe I just don't have the hang of card deck games and need some help with strategy. My girls and I enjoyed Unleashed more and it's rated 2 full points lower.

A fun star wars game that does not stink as most boardgames that are made after movies.Once you get to the know the decks it can become easier cause you know the types of cards each person has.

First impressions:  This was a nice pickup.  It plays very quickly, which means it can be used as a filler.  The rules can be explained in 5 minutes.  It plays great with 2 players, but can scale up to many more.  Replay value seems to be high, since all the characters play differently.  Downsides:  Might be hard to balance the characters.  There is downtime when lots of people are playing. I'll continue to work this into the rotation.  I'd love to get a small tournament going at one of our larger game nights.

I love this game in the range of the games I have rated higher, but ultimately the mechanics hinge on which characters are in play and whether you draw your best cards. With more players, there is a chance that it will be more enjoyable for *some* of the players who last long enough.

Easy to learn and setup, but mostly enjoyable for the Star Wars references and novelty, and for trash talk.

Also loses points due to needing even numbers of players to be most smoothly played.

Fun game, primarily as a mindless "eat light saber, puny garden gnome!!" kind of beat 'em up game. The idea of character-specific card decks is a brilliant piece of design! However, the game desperately needs more boards and scenarios to keep it interesting in the long run.

Sold my first copy, the had to get a new one (more expensive, of course). Plan to play this with the kids when they're a little older.

This is a good game and it's from MB! Sure the figures are painted a little goofy, but they aren't cardboard counters, the cards aren't the greatest stock quality, but they are full color and pictures instead of illustrations and the boards are a bit small if you have a lot of characters on it... But this is a fairly fast and overall a really fun game.  I prefer to draw characters randomly so people don't complain about getting weak characters - but even then I've seen "weak" ones win the game because of others getting vengful or just plain making dumb moves. Fun, fun, fun and with a star wars theme, what more could you want?

The 8/9 year old Star Wars fanatic that this game is intended for would probably rate this game a 9 or 10. Regular gamers without a particular interest in the subject would probably rate it about a 6. Having individual decks for each battle team is a great idea. In practice, the game can get rather static with players not moving and just playing cards on each other. I'm sort of splitting the difference on my score. This is almost a MUST BUY for kids into Star Wars, like my son. He's six, so we play with open hands so that I can read the special cards to him.

RATING: 5
The idea is a good one, but there's not enough meat on the bones here.  Played multi-player or in teams, it suffers from everyone concentrating on the same target (or player) and exhausting his ability to defend himself.  Also, there is little strategy to positioning yourself, so lightsaber characters frequently just stand toe-to-toe and hack away until one falls down.  For this reason, the combat needed to be more dynamic.

Before the arrival of WOTC's Star Wars Miniatures and FFG series of games, Star Wars Epic Duels was THE go to game for accessible and entertaining SW gameplay. Countless battles EPIC and otherwise make this card based combat game fun, and never dull.  
The roster is Pre-Episode 3 so don't look to get General Grievous or Episode 7 battlers in the box (There was/is an active fan-base with custom sets online) but those who are present offer tons of fun.
The game is a great entryway to deeper fare (as it was for me) but its sadly out of print (new copies can be had for big money online) so its a legend who has moved on and achieved "Force Ghost" status, standing alongside other departed heroes.

Fast paced, rip-roaring and totally fun game that I was able to teach my entire family to play on the first time out. Familiar characters and great opportunities to break out your best Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine impressions make this one of the best games for quick fun in my collection. A minor drawback is a small repetitive feeling after many, many plays, which can be avoided by working on your own variants and game maps, or subscribing to the YahooGroups mailing group.

Easy and fun card oriented combat game.  Seems to scale well with 2-6 players.  Kids would easily pick up this game.  Basically roll a die for movement of character(s) and then take two actions (draw a card, play a combat/special card, or expend a minor character card to gain back one health).  Lightsaber characters must be in an adjacent space to an enemy to battle while range weapon characters only need LOS.  Player elimination does occur but generally the game is over pretty quickly.

You want an easy knock down drag out fight with one of the best themes around, this is it. The fan support of this game can't be topped, and it's just plain fun.  The components are bare bones, but there is definitely room to grow in that area by doing some upgrading. I would definitely like to play a few more games of this, and see what some of the other characters can do. Warning: If you play with six people, make sure you play on teams, otherwise the game can drag on a bit.

After trading away SW:ED after a few games that left a bad taste in my mouth I got an itch that I wanted to give it another try, and so I recently did just that. I am so glad I did. This game is exactly what I am looking for, a fast, brutal, bloody, all out brawl with a good theme. You can get in a game in thirty minutes when you have players who know what they are doing. Its all run and gun, and stop being a coward and running away like a little bitch. Get in there and act like the jedi you are playing as! Great fun little game.

RATING: 6
Love the miniatures and the game even though the mechanics are simple and the decks aren't balanced.  The lack of balance does add to the thematicness--it makes sense that Palpatine is stronger than Solo.  

Now yes, it's a little goofy that you have emperor palpatine fighting jango fett and all that.  But who cares?  As a kid there was nothing I could have loved better than this game.  

Some of the miniatures inevitably get damaged though, because they're cheap plastic.  Count Dooku lost his lightsaber a long time ago and has just been an old professor with a laser pointer ever since...

There's a fairly high amount of luck to this game.  The length is medium--about an hour.  So the luck-to-time ratio is higher than I would like, but not too bad.

The thematicness is pretty high.  It has all the major characters from episodes 1-6 except for General Grievous.  The miniatures are, to a kid, highly detailed.  To a miniatures person, no, not really.  But I view this as a thematic game, not a game for miniatures hobbyists.  SO I think the quality is good for the type of game this is.

Expandibility: not good.  There are no expansions for the game and no way to get new maps to play on.  4 maps come with the game but it would be nice if there were more.  Now I will say, there are fan-made expansions for other characters in the EU.  So if you want to go the PNP route you could get more.

Strategy: the depth is only so-so.  You can save up cards or attack early.  Some characters are better at either, and the situation can dictate which you want to do.  Some characters have different strategies so you want to learn what cards are in their decks.  And then there's the fact that, once a major character is taken out, then all cards pertaining to him are useless, so it's really worth it to try to concentrate attacks on a major character and wipe them out.  Likewise, prevent your enemy from wiping out any of your characters too early.

But again, because luck is such a strong element in this game, that strategy only goes so deep.  You move based on a die roll, so sometimes you simply can't protect a character, no matter how much you would like to.  

Overall there's not anything really innovative about this game.

There is a bluffing element of this game.  You have to defend an attack without knowing what the attack is, so you want to guess whether your opponent is doing a good attack yet or not.  There are some things that can tip you off but there's also the part of guessing what your opponent is most likely to do, so that helps add to the game.

As an adult I still appreciate this game.  I don't play it very often, but it's fun, and will gladly play it anytime others too.  It has a kind of vintage feel to it now too because it's so worn.  This game is expensive because there were no re-printings.

For having a little strategy, fairly strong theme, and a little too much luck for how long it is, I give this a 6.5/10.  I enjoy this but it's certainly not an innovative or really well-designed game.  But it scratches the right itch.  Really, I would only give this a 6, but...nostalgia....and Star Wars.

Rating based on initial play.  Decent card game with map and figures added for flair.  Not a lot of strategy or even tactics, but the theme carries the game even if the mechanics don't.  The individualized character decks are a nice touch, even if not entirely balanced.  This is not a game to take too seriously.  Heroscape fills the same niche with dice instead of cards (and with better figures, but less coherent theme).

CCG without the cost.  After 50+ plays, I've upped the score from 9 to 10.  Those who say it lacks strategy or is too imbalanced haven't analyzed the decks and/or played enough large battles. Epic Dules is a CCG-like, poker-ish, card management/strategy game all rolled up into one.

Individual battles between famous Star Wars characters set on different board locations. Players choose a major character that has one or two minor characters with it. Each set of characters has its own deck of cards which are used for attack, defense, or special abilities. Each deck is unique with certain special powers relevant to the major character. There are different modes of play; one on one battles, up to three teams can play against each other, or up to six players can play a free for all, last man standing battle.

Actually pretty fun.  My wife likes it and is in no way, shape, or form a Star Wars fan.  For those who are fans, there's a plus with all the references to the movies.  You don't need to know what they mean though, since it describes what the card does below each term.

UPDATE: getting kind of tired of this.  I'm starting to dislike games where you can get booted off by the choice of your opponents, and you sit there watching others play.

2-6p, 30m.  It is less like a multi-player "Clash of the Lightsabers" then I hoped.  Sure it has cards and Star Wars themed figurines, but the similarity ends there.  Whereas CotL is perfectly balanced, and your hand gives lots of choices, SW:ED is un-balanced, and often find a hand full of useless cards.  And the cheap plastic figurines are garishly painted.

This is a fun game... as long as Darth Maul is not my opponent.  I was slaughterded by him on the second or third turn and now I refuse to play against him.

It had been 2 years since we played it and when everyone suggested it, I was dreading it, so I think I'll have to lower my rating.  I did play it and I won, but it really isn't a game I'm keen to play often.

Got it in a trade with Jooky for my son, who is a Star Wars fanatic.

This is very playable [i]with children[/i]. Pull it out the first time, and you're playing in 10 minutes or so. It's not a brain burner, children age 8 or so should be able to play and there are enough characters/decks that it should be replayable. I've played twice with my son, and he liked it a lot. And so it seems to be a fun little Star Wars romp.

After having played this against a sober adult, I have to say that this isn't much of a game. There's nothing to it. It's like air, but without all the stuff that keeps you from falling to the ground clutching your throat while you suffer an agonizing death like so much carbon-based meat on an atmosphereless world. It's great with a Star Wars loving kid. It's a lot like rolling a die to see who gets the higher number against non-drunken adult opponents. It's got the always problematic cards that say, in effect, "You Win!"

So that 6 is probably a reflection of how much I love my kid or how low my standards are. Possibly both.

A mix of both a miniature game and card game, Epic Duels is simple enough for newbs and light enough that it can be played as a "last game of the evening" game. Rules are straightforward and although you may not find much in the way of genre-breaking gameplay it is plenty of fun and scales well for more then two players. 

Will be wasted on those uninitiated with the Star Wars Saga, but then is there actually anyone that isn't?! 

Rendered virtually obsolete by Star Wars Miniatures which is bigger and debate-ably more interesting, but it still works as an end of night filler every-so-often and I think out of the two I prefer Epic Duels.

Meh.  We  played 5 player free for all with 2 character cards each.  Took too long for a lightweight random semi strategy game.  I have a feeling the game might be better as a team game.  And/or, that you should only use one character card.  I felt like you spiral into defeat if lose one or the other character on your card because you start drawing useless cards.  You should be able to replace those for free to keep yourself viable as a force in the game.

Roll dice, move your Star Wars characters, then play cards to attack other characters. Each character has it's own deck of cards, giving different abilities. Fun light game that can be played socially or with Eurogamers. Creates a fun Star Wars ambience. Some decks are more powerful than others (such as Yoda or Darth Maul) so it would be hard to judge skill solely by wins. Plays best with 4 as a team game, 2 players is decent, but 6 players is too chaotic, and someone could be eliminated before getting more than 1 turn.

RATING: 7
Although it's billed as a 2 player game, it really needs to be played with the variant "team" rules.  The one on one battles are usually over far too quickly if one person gains the upper hand with a lucky draw of cards.  Still, it's fun to play out all of the geeky Star Wars Jedi fantasy match-ups.  It's a shame it's out of print, since it just screams for expansions.

RATING: 7
Minitiares fighting game using the SW mileu, where each of the characters has individual abilities and powers. Pretty minis and fun boards that restrict movement. Simple rules make for a relatively quick resolution of the battle. A bonus comes in the fact that you can play this game in teams.

RATING: 8
The fact that this game is Star Wars-themed and has miniatures was a big plus for me.  I hoped this game would be fun and I was not disappointed.  The rules are simple and play is quick.  The key to this game is the individual character decks.  Each character card deck has differing strengths and weaknesses just like the actual characters from the Star Wars movies.  As there are lots of different characters the potential for each game to be a new experience is very high.

Epic Duels is a really great system.  It is a shame that the expansion didn't come together.  The game has some balance issues, which is the only reason it is not a 10 in my book.  However, my friends and I play with customs that are geared to tier 2 (Anakin, Dooku, and Mace), and it is a game I will never turn down.  Team play is especially fun, and overall even if you don't go the customs route, it is a game that I highly recommend.  If you do check it out, look into the customs people have done as well.  They add a ton of value to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A good design and a fun game, and an extra half point for sheer fun factor, particularly since the characters are so well known, which helps invest players with a sense of identification. 

It's an easy to learn and to teach, and a perfect blend of simplicity and clarity in rules, balance and strategy/tactics. (Even though the newer Star Wars X-Wing game from Fantasy Flight is a beautiful production, I think this game is a better design, because so it gets to the essence of its own design so much more fluidly.) 

Each major character has his or her own deck of cards for him or herself and their attendant "minor" character, which give a wide array of attack, defense, and special powers. And, as one will soon learn from game play, the sidekicks are there to soak up hits. 

There also are four separate thick, coated cardboard boards, each a distinct scenario in which to fight. Top that off with color plastic characters representing the characters you know, love or hate, and you have the makings of a great time, especially the more extroverted and humorous players are. 

Acquired from teen-age son of a friend, January 2010. My friend said it was a present to his son, but they never played, and his son only played with the plastic figures before outgrowing that, too. Good for me and my 10-year-old son (2009), who loved it and at that time gave it a "10".

Played 2 games with 6 year old. Count Dooku vs Mace Windu and Boba Fett vs Luke. Won both times as the light side. 

Things I liked:
1. Every deck plays differently.
2. Positioning matters given this is a tactical minis game

Things I didn't like:
1. Limited set of actions. Healing seemed like a waste of actions
2. Gameplay becomes a game of cat and mouse once minor characters are gone and highly dependent on dice roll.
3. Certain cards are really underpowered, requiring some house rules

I still enjoy the game and dun think I'll ever part with it given the star wars fan I am.

Played my first game today. Count Dooku vs Anakin and Padme. Dooku won. Fun and light. Wonder how multiplayer and master play will be like. Rating based on first impressions.

Avoid 7 player games of this like the plague. Extrapolating my view of the mechanics to a realistic number of players, that number might be 0. It has a place in a gamer collection, but not my place. Dice. Card. Dice. Card. Dice. Card. Shoot to kill. Shoot to kill.

This is a nice 20 minute distraction, not a game! If you like nice looking mini's (only the custom one's mind you) and love star wars I suppose you might like this. Obviously this is heavily card driven so there is not much strategy, "other than fight when you have cards and run when you don't". I could see kids liking this game as I seem to remember playing the "war card game" when I was a kid and liking it (each player plays a card from his hand and the highest card wins), this is similar in that respect and about as deep.

Fantastic little, fast, simple game for everyone. Lucky yes, but strategy too with a solid mechanic and (most important of all) ...a LOT of fun! A rare, little gem.
For me it's a 10, mostly considering all the custom teams I added to the game (see below).

Only one thing: you must be a fan of Star Wars saga/heroes to appreciate it completely.

My personal (and final... at least for now) Epic Duels Game now counts 82 decks - the original 12 plus 70 custom, 35 for the Light Side and 35 for the Dark Side - choosed with care between the best on the internet (and some created by me), all printed in high quality and laminated; I use SW Miniatures to represent the characters (see my photos here on BGG). Furthermore I've created other decks using Hybrid miniatures and an entire new game which I named 'D&D Epic Duels' based on the D&D universe using the core mechanics from Epic Duels with some little twists (like custom team-creation and special items for characters) and 24 characters - I use D&D Miniatures and D&D tiles for the maps.

Ah, I also bought the 'Halo Interactive Strategy Game' just to have a sort of 3D map generator for the game.

Uhm, maybe I'm a bit obsessed by this game...? :)

Ok for while but not as steady diet. A must only if you are a huge Star Wars fan.

Don't approach as a strategy game. It is more of a beat up on each other and hope the right cards come out type of game. 

Like the different decks for different people and each deck is tailored for each character. However, don't look for any kind of balance. The figures are good, but there doesn't seem to be any variations in the boards.

Ok, this IS a fun game, if a little on the light side (no pun intended).  What you sacrifice in complexity you gain in ease of learning, quickness of games, and accessibility to your non-geek friends.  That being said, the game "seems" a little imbalanced in favor of some of the characters, though this opinion may change with more game plays. Certainly Mace is an absolute cream puff in this one, which is not right! One of the better Star Wars games out there.

07-09-2015. Rated after 2-3 plays. In Epic Duels, you play a couple of characters from the SW universe. Each character has a side kick. You use a die to determine who many figures you can move and how far. Then, you use cards to attack/defend.

SW:ED is fun. It's not a good game, but it's not so good as Queen's Gambit.

I didn't expect much, and really only picked this up because I found it at a thrift store for like $3 and I saw that it included miniatures. I was shocked when I actually enjoyed the game.

There's something wonderfully grade-school about how this game views Star Wars. What if Darth Vader and Count Dooku fought a fight?? WHO WOULD WIN? As for the design itself it is well-executed. A lot of consideration clearly went into making each character deck feel appropriate, even if the balance isn't totally there. It's not a very deep game, but that's not really a problem. It at least embraces its own immediacy, and understands that sometimes being easy and fun is good enough.

I generally do not like miniatures games, but this one gets a boost from the Star Wars theme and the quick play.

I love Star Wars, and therefore Star Wars themed games, and this is one of the best of them that I've played.  It is a light (easy to teach and learn) minature game.  I have a gripe about the quality of components that came in the game (too small cards, limited amout of battle boards (two double-sided), the cheap miniatures, and what has to be the worst die to ever come in a game), but it was a very inexpensive game(~$15) when it was available at the store, so the components are what you'd expect for that price.  I've enhanced the game by replacing the minitures with ones from the WotC Star Wars minatures game.  In spite of the low production values, this is a very fun little game and will see many plays over it's lifetime.

OK, my mate Jon decided to play this with me to settle it once and for all: Epic Duels is over-rated. And IT IS.

A fair bit of luck with the card draw (you're screwed if your main character dies and you're left stuck with a bunch of special cards). It can get one sided. Some of the powers seem broken.

It's for the fans and to be played as a light hearted romp. The miniatures game by WOTC is similar but collectible.

Many a college class was missed because we were up all night finishing games. Stinks when players go out early and have to wait for the next game, and a lot of time can be wasted staring each other down waiting for someone else to make a move, but a few simple house rules helped fix some of these issues. Also very easy to create custom decks after new characters in the Star Wars universe that make creative use of the game mechanics. Many custom decks are available free online.

Just a fun game to bring out and play.  The problem is it struggles with balance between the characters.  There is a site that tries to rebalance things, but I haven't tried it out yet.  That might make things better, it also adds some more characters.

Usually movie/tv franchise games aren't as well developed so it is always a pleasant surprise when you find a gem like this one. It uses a unique battle system that makes it feel a bit like chess with special moves. I just wish I had more people to play it with or that they continued to develop and support the game.

RATING: 7
From a design standpoint, seems pretty swingy and very loosely balanced. However, it is good, pure, oldschool fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. 

If it did take itself a bit more seriously, I think we'd be looking at a classic here. As it is, it is probably outdone by more developed tactical combat games... but there is something very endearing and unique here with the simplicity and the components and the multiple board "stages" for sure.

Worried that this game doesnt really have anti-turtling devicies in most matchups, but we'll see about that.

RATING: 8
What a blast! An easy to teach, learn and play tactical combat game with awesome looking minis, set in the Star Wars universe, with plenty of nail-biting tension and memorable fighting. Playing the cards to move your character around the board and perform whirlwind lightsabre attacks or using the force to throw debris at your opponents really does feel like the epic fight scenes from the movies. Characters are included from both the original trilogy and the prequels. Even if you think the prequels were an abomination, the fight scenes with Darth Maul, Count Dooku or Yoda were still awesome - and this gem of a game captures those scenes surprisingly well.

RATING: 7
Quite a difference with 2 and 4 players.

Kinda fun with 4 people playing good guys and bad guys, although it sucks getting eliminated, or ganged up on, or getting bad cards while other people get good cards and you are defenseless, or one of your guys gets eliminated and you keep getting that guy's card.  So basically, there is a bunch of crap to get in the way of this being a fun game.  With that said when things go well, it is kind of entertaining, sadly someone isn't having a good time. I give it a 4 with 4, just because someone is getting screwed by no fault of their own and I feel that I continually need to apologize.

With two though you just run your guys around a mess the other guy up and then the game ends.  It is just the right length.  Very simple, and though it is card dependent, The deck isn't overwhelmingly large.  Easy fun filler.

Unplayed. My good friend wkover sent this as a bonus when sending Survive! EDIT: Fun but I would prefer a full blown game of Heroscape. EDIT: I had forgotten how quickly this game plays so Heroscape is actually not a substitute. Some decks seem a little out of whack, but you can always switch sides. Shooter v. Shooter isn't as fun as other match-ups, but my games clock in at about 20-30 minutes, so it's not a deal breaker.

This is a Hasbro game done as a tie in during the release of Attack of the Clones.  I got a copy of it from Toys R' Us and gave it to my son.  He no longer owns it, but it is really an excellent light skirmish game that is very thematic and easy to learn.

One wishes that all these tie in games were so well done.  Someday I'll track down a copy on ebay.

RATING: 6.5
First impression: check out all those awesome dudes!!  But then when I read the rules, I was worried that this would be similar to "Heroquest Marvel" (a game I enjoyed), where you run your characters at each other and then beat on each other until one team is left, but without the fun of the character turns and the challenge of the terrain (in other words, a more dumbed-down version) of "Heroquest Marvel".  But when we played, I was pleased to discover that there's a fair bit of tactical maneuvering required with the characters, and each action is an agonizing decision, particularly when playing a 2-player game with 2 main characters per player.  It's still a somewhat overly-simple game that could really benefit from more interesting maps/terrain features, but the card-based play at least is interesting.  And the figures!  How can you not love the 31 painted plastic Star Wars characters!  SO cool!!  That alone is going to boost this game's "game design" rating - definitely a very big "toy" factor, which the child in me still enjoys very much.  I can see how this game would have a huge appeal to kids (particularly to boys, I imagine), and that even adults could have a lot of fun playing as teams with 4 players.  As an added bonus, my wife enjoyed this game.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

[1 play] I only played this game once, but have played the Transformers version more times.  I still just don't get this game that much.  It really seems like it has a lot of card drawing and just not a lot of tough decision or strategy.  It just seems too light and somewhat boring.  I like the theme of the Transformers better than Star Wars too.  However, I do like how the Star War version has a team paired up on the same card and how some units don't have range.  Those are better aspects of the game than the Transformers version has.  It is not the worst game in the world to play as a filler or to play with my son.  But definately not one I recommend either.

Raised the rating based on playing again. This time we played much faster than the first time and I had much more fun. My first session was with several old AH type gamers. They put way too much thought into the game making it into a 2 hour plus ordeal.

However, the game is still terribly imbalanced. And I'm not sure if there is any real point in actually playing out the cards. Probably could just reveal who you selected and decide the winner. 

That complaint aside, I did have fun.

Played this two games in a row at Gencon. I was certainly happy with my 2 plays of the game, but both me and my opponent were... underwhelmed by the game. 
For an 8 year old Star Wars fan, I think this game would rock on toast. Easy to play, fun to look at and enough special options cards to keep things interesting.
For someone older or less SW interested, the game falls pretty flat, honestly. Cardplay consists of hoping your opponent doesn't have a defense card. There's no actual "terrain" in some of the boards - leading to an old-west shootout feel.
I was happy for 2 plays and would gladly have paid $5-10 for the game, but not current prices. 

Note: My son is now (approximately) an 8 year old Star Wars fan. He loves this game. I was right. For that, it's a 8-9. For adults, a 4. Take it as you will.

RATING: 6
A fun little game.  There are definitely better characters than others. Odd numbers of players create "death to pig in the middle" syndrome.  Really gets me in a StarWars mood. Question: Can you turn corners during the movement of a character?  It would make the boards REALLY small, so we play no but... 2006/02/06

I can't give it a higher rating, because I'm too much of a Star Wars nerd... and I can't stop myself from picking apart really minute things about the characters, and wishing there was a Lando and a Qui-Gon and every other character that there ever has been.  But my old roommate and I loved it, as a game that's fast enough that you can play a bunch of times without it getting old.

I have played the original, but most of my playing time comes from custom decks. This is my favorite quick game to play. With 4 players, a game may take 30-45 minutes, so we tend to play a couple in a row. I built around 45 decks specific to Mass Effect that we use playing under the rules according to the original game, http://epicduels.pbworks.com has an easy to use program to create your own decks so you can impress your friends by essentially building your own game.

 My original purchase of this was on sale from a Toys R Us bargain bin, and I was really not too shocked to find that the contents were -- imperfect.  Missing cards, multiply duplicated sets of cards .. it was a mess.  After pulling it out for a few necessarily limited plays, I wrote to Hasbro USA (couldn't find a CA contact at that time) asking if I could purchase replacement decks .. They wrote back *horrified* that I'd received a misprinted or mispackaged unit and sent free replacements of all card components.  Fabulous and entirely unexpected customer service.  And a very nifty game!

This another surprisingly good board game based on the Star Wars franchise, like Queen's Gambit, although not as good as Queen's Gambit in my mind.  Perhaps I'd enjoy Epic Duels more if I tried it with just 2 players as it would be zero-sum then.  I definitely like all the different boards and characters and cards that come with the game, and it's fun to see all these unlikely characters square off against each other.  For its speed and its theme and its simplicity combined with meaningful decision-making, I'd be happy to play it just about anytime it came out.

My son loves this game, but he's also a huge Star Wars fan.  This comment is from several years ago.
Played again recently and with the card draw, this game falls into the "fun, but don't over think" category.  It is very thematical and if you like Star Wars, this has a lot of theme and fun for you.  If you are looking for a deep strategy game that just happens to have a Star Wars theme, then you probably want to pass on it.

this game has some point: painted minis, dreams comes true fights between good and evil ones... but in the end it remains a game for fans only: little tactical manouvers, poor balanced, simplistic.

It feels to me like a super lite CDG with cool miniatures.  It plays quickly, I'd almost go so far as to call it a CDG filler game.  A decent game to play with a younger opponent or a fellow Star Wars geek who wants a quick, light game.  The components are great.

I kind of like this simple battle game.  You have cards and miniatures.  It is very balanced even though different characters have different attacks.  Yoda and Vader may be a bit unbalnaced.

Guilty pleasure. No there isn't much to it but each game is diffent and relatively quick. Well designed. Would love to see an advanced version of this.

RATING: 8
A very cool game indeed.  It is pretty much a miniatures wargame.  With a card based combat system, it leaves chance in what the other player will play, not in the dice.  Movement, however is by chance.  A dice tells you how much you can move in a turn, so that is why I really like the fact that it emphasizes player control over their units and how they move and attack but less tactical and tedious as many other wargames (character traits/skills/etc to keep tract of), so everyone can enjoy it.

RATING: 7
Fast, fun, furious, and downright weird when you have Han Solo taking out Luke Skywalker in a three-way free-for-all.  Sure, it's die- and card-driven, but so what?  It's a great hit with families.

2 plays: 2 players
1 play: 3 players

A main character and one or two sidekicks square off against an opponent and his/her sidekick(s). Each character/sidekick combo has its own deck of about 30+ cards used to attack and defend. A die is used for movement. 

Simple, fast, fun!

RATING: N/A
Individual battles between famous Star Wars characters set on different board locations. Players choose a major character that has one or two minor characters with it. Each set of characters has its own deck of cards which are used for attack, defense, or special abilities. Each deck is unique with certain special powers relevant to the major character. There are different modes of play; one on one battles, up to three teams can play against each other, or up to six players can play a free for all, last man standing battle.

Very cool miniatures for a department store board game. It played pretty well, simple but fun. I only played it once to see how it worked, then sort of forgot about it. Sold after the price skyrocketed on the secondary market. It was a nice game, but not nicer than the wad of cash I got for it.

RATING: 5
Great game for what it is.  Light, nice components, much better than it looks at first sight.  It's largely decided by drawing the right cards in the right order, but there is scope for bluffing and it's always a tradeoff between hitting your opponent and defending yourself. Must, I repeat *must*, be played quickly to be enjoyable.

Most annoying factor is having dead cards clogging your hand. I think all the secondary cards should be multi-use from the get-go, where you can either discard to heal or discard two to draw another.

A perfect card driven miniatures fighting system that's simple and fun.  Got an extra set of this game when it went on sale just to have an extra set of the cards.  Crammed it all into one box and threw out the other.  Too bad as it's now fetching a premium price on ebay.

UPDATE: sold it!

very light game but results in many many giggles and star wars one liners. After introducing this to work colleagues this has gone up from a low 5 to a 7. Although it's not *my* pick of game genre I would want to play regularly, some games are better than playing none at all. And I've become to appreciate this very light game. Sure there's a lot of luck to it, but everyone seems to enjoy getting into character and playing team battles. I'll keep it I think.

RATING: 9
One of the best Star Wars games ever created.  Excellent variety in characters and strategies - what works great for one will lead to certain doom with another.

There is a fair amount of luck involved with the card draws, but the game plays quick enough that it'll usually even out over a couple plays.

--------
We use a house rule that a player is not instantly defeated when their primary character is killed, otherwise the secondary characters tend to get ignored entirely by opponents unless they can do area damage and/or can get an instant kill.  Chewbacca becomes the powerhouse he should be, and you also get the occasional hilarious moment where a powerful Jedi like Yoda gets taken out by a battle droid.

A no-brainer purchase for SW fans, and probably the best SW game to come out around Ep II, this is card activated, mini figure fighting will all your favorite SW heroes and villians. Great detail in tailoring the different character decks help make strategy vastly differ from game to game. It's a bit dry just one on one, but if two players control two characters at the same time (as suggested in the rules) it gets better.

In hindsight it was probably a bad idea to play Epic Duels right after Queen's Gambit.  There is just no comparison.  The gameplay is incredibly shallow here.  Roll and move, then maybe you get to play a card or two.  Basically whoever gets the right hand wins.  Besides the Star Wars theme, I don't really get why people go crazy over this OOP title, certainly does not worth the high price it is fetching for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice little card-driven game.  The figures are excellent.  The game is simple and decidedly governed by luck, but that doesn't take from the game.  It is a great game to get others into the hobby and most non-gamers will play it because it is a Star Wars game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The action cards for each miniature team do a very good job evoking the theme, and the teasing two actions per turn give nice, tough choices to the players.  This game provides combat by card play, which I always prefer over combat by die roll.  Perhaps this would be more fun for me as a two-player game.  Certainly, I think it would improve with subsequent plays, because you better understand the strategies you should consider with whatever major character you are using.  I expected to rate this a 4, but I'm surprised that I must confess it's actually more of a 5 for me.  I suppose I should play it again sometime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
After 5+ Plays: I'm a bit biased because I'm a huge Star Wars fan, but the game itself is really quite fun.  Just enough thought and strategy to keep me engaged, and a good helping of luck to keep things interesting.  This seems like it would loose its appeal after many games in a short period, but I'm going to try not to play so much that I get burned out.

--Update: Played my first game of this in 5 years, and just can't remember what I saw in it.  Of course, I first played it when I was just starting out with boardgames, so I didn't have a lot to compare it to.  Lowering rating from 8 to 5.

A lot like Star Wars miniatures, but obviously without the collecting part. The variable decks are just great and really bring the flavor of the characters to the game. The game board has not much effect on the game, though.

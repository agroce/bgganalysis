RATING: 9
My favourite miniatures skirmish game. 

Pros:
The grid movement is simple and quick (no need for a tape measure). The small foot print on the table (2 foot by 2 foot) is great and allows for very congested city/street battles. The game is fast and lots of fun. 

Cons:
The only thing holding it back are the miniatures which look fine but are a total pig to put together (particularly the Forge Fathers). 

N.B.
I like the GCPS shiny corporate universe, but the Deadzone system could easily be applied to other theatres of war such as World War 2 (bombed out city street combat between a couple of squads).

I love this game.  The mechanics are basic enough for my 10 yr old son to learn, but  mastering of the game is a different matter.  The factions are (largely) well balanced, it has oodles of re-playability and it doesn't take forever to set up and take down, unlike many minis games.  And on the subject of minis, Mantic isn't the best mini manufacturer out there but they are learning and improving all the time.  DZ minis have reached the "good" stage, the scenery is at the "very good" stage and the rulebook/tokens etc are excellent.  Currently my go-to game.

Fantastic setting, great minisand terrain. Has easy to learn rules which play quickly. Turns are very dynamic and the dice mechanics keep things interesting. Your options shift from turn to turn in ways which keep the game from devolving into a slug fest. Highly recommended.

Played one game and did not like the changes fro 1st edition.  People say it plays better than the 1st edition, maybe.  Seems like it ripped out the interesting parts for a pretty mediocre game. Less tactical options and more listing building to me.  Also did like the fact as a retailer backer the pdf was not available to me. Can't understand why a new edition of rules only 2 years after the first isn't just publicly available.  Infinity puts there game out for free.

The 2nd edition is a really clean skirmish system with the benefit of using a grid. Very good gateway game and really enjoy the campaign and zombie modes.

Fast paced, fun, and deadly! Lots of great moments and miniatures, not to mention fully modular, fabulous terrain in a fantastic universe.

An excellent exciting action packed game. This game put a great different perspective on board gaming. Its fast paced and rules don't bog it down. Great community of players and support. Easily my #1 game of choice

Very fun and very quick. The Mantic miniatures are pretty low quality compared to GW and North Star, but compared to board games, they're ok.

Deadzone 2d edition threaded the needle and came out the other side an improved game.  I had my concerns about the loss of fidelity from jettisoning so many of the more interesting mechanics, but what we got in the end is a very teachable and playable game.

Characterful factions and models, fast exciting gameplay, and a great value boxset with two hard plastic forces,  hard plastic scenery and a hard back rulebook. So much hardness! ;)
Lots of continuing development from mantic, and an enthusiastic online community,  find Deadzone Fanatics on Facebook.

1st edition was a somewhat flawed game in need of polishing. The 2nd edition rules overhaul oversimplified the game too much for my liking. It killed the unique flavor rules of the different factions, and the fact that it rendered accessories purchased for 1st edition obsolete really irked me.

Fantastic table top skirmish games.  Rules have been streamlined from v1 and the new hard plastic miniatures are awesome

Faster, smoother playing than 1st edition, which is a plus for me. The Veer-Myn models are nicely done and make for a good adversary.

This game has a balance and support from the producers. This is the best small model count skirmisher on the market in my opinion.

Great skirmish game! Can use the same miniatures for larger Warpath Firefight 2nd Ed battles or smaller Star Saga games.

A huge improvement on the original game which was pretty grim.
Does seem to take Mantic 2 goes or more to get their rules right.
Has now replaced Necromunda for me.

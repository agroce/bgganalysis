I think this would be quite a bit of fun if everyone had a strong handle on the order of the hands and is comfortable with bluffing. That said, I'm not sure I'd want to expend the energy to get to that point. I think this would make a great "cabin game" - something you play a lot with the same group over and over again, as opposed to just another part of your collection that might hit the table every so often.

After a first play, everyone yelled "one more time!" We play three more times. After the third game, we all started getting nasty, with bluff lead in battle, lots of trash talking, and calling each other out. Great fun!

War and poker mixed together. Some luck of the draw and some patience of knowing when to strike and a lot of know which battles you're going to fight (and WIN) make this a moderately entertaining title.

A pleasant enough diversion, and far better IMHO with a lot more depth than poker, the game it most resembles.  Might be a good crossover game, and I think I'll pick it up to foist it on my unsuspecting relations over the holidays.  Quite a good filler with a great evocative theme.

The theme is so light it practically floats away! Very nice cards, though, with artwork from a Mediaeval Bible. Unfortunately, the artwork portrayed is from the century prior to the Hundred Year's War beginning! Havoc is essentially themed poker...Now, after having said all those negative things, Havoc is, nevertheless, a real fun game to play! And the anachronistic art on the cards is actually part of the appeal!

Brilliant game: fast, strategic, and satisfying. The best elements from poker taken to a new level. We played several times with different numbers of players. My wife and I also played the 2-player, and found it to be very engaging.

RATING: 8
A fine game using elements of poker with a touch of rummy and some unique elements, such as the dogs of war. Picking your battles and your level of commitment to them is critical, as different battles offer widely varying victory point differentials for first, second and third.  The Medieval artwork on the cards is nice, though the card quality could have been better.

First impression: The game shares some of the sweet frustration of Taj Mahal but I doubt it has the "legs" that Taj has. You commit to playing a bunch of cards, occasionally coming away with nothing but a weaker hand. Will play it again before picking a #.
Oh! And please don't call it a "poker variant"!
"Follow the Queen" is a 'poker variant'!

RATING: 6
{1 play - 6 players} Interesting, this one.  I think using poker-ish hands to determine battle winners is neat, because most gamers already know the hierarchy, so there's less of a learning curve with regard to what's a good bid (sometimes a problem in "auction" games, especially for first-timers). I'm also kind of a sucker for games where there's "resourse" managment based on being able to see what's coming up next.  In fact, this game is actually a LOT like Beowulf, if you think about... except, for some reason, Beowulf's got that thing, and this one just doesn't.  And it's not just the theme (way more pasted on here than in most of the games Knizia gets accused of), I think, for me, it's that the game is... too... basic.  I enjoyed my one playing of it, and there's nothing inherently wrong here... but, well... it's like the difference between Raj and High Society (additional Knizia reference not intended).  I don't need to play Havoc again, though if others want to, I'd have no problem with that.  It just needs something more, something extra.  It feels like a prototype - not in a rough edges way, because everything there seems polished.  It's like there either needs to be some extra "game" here, or more "fun" for the game that exists.

i think the multi-player battle line descriptions are pretty accurate.  nice cards, neat box, simple rules, nice player aid, overall a lot to like.  the luck factor, or if you prefer the intense card-counting factor, drags it down a peg.  so does its slightly-too-long feel.  it's still a game worth trying.

This is not really a poker game, except that it uses an extended form of poker hands to value the bids you make with your cards.  I like the battles used for scoring, since you can form a strategy based on what you have in your hand (and might get) and the battles you can see coming in the next several turns.  You may only need to come in second-best or even third-best---and in this I am reminded of Taj Mahal, where you can drop out of the bidding early and get court personage tokens and extra cards as a (sometimes necessary and powerful) consolation prize.  The way that cards are used for the auction also reminds me of Taj Mahal, although Taj Mahal used icons for valuation, and Havoc uses poker hands.

The Dogs of War cards (of which there are rather a few, though not too many) add an interesting touch, since there are multiple things you can do with them (fetch cards from the table post-battle, for instance).  Of perhaps more interest are the battles, which have different additional rewards for victors and other participants, apart from the points won.

Makes poker highly enjoyable even for people who (think they) do not like it, by adding some rule twists and a great theme. Looks superb and I even got a free expansion and a spin 4 it finger for free when purchasing it at Essen 2005!

I don't really enjoy poker, but I had a great time playing this take on it. It's a little too long for the weight, so it probably won't see as much play time as it would if it could be used as a filler, but I enjoyed it and am looking forward to playing it again.

Update: My first two games were with 6 players, and they took a long, long time. However, when I played it with 4 players, it took less than an hour. In fact, having only experienced the 6-player game, my timing was completely off. I used a 5-card flush and a 6-card straight flush to win the third and fourth battles (putting me well in the lead), figuring that there'd be plenty of time left to build up my hand for the last two. However, people kept calling Havoc willy-nilly, and before I knew it, we were into the penultimate battle and I had only one card in my hand! Not cool, man.

This poker adaptation is enjoyable, though a little long with more than 4 players. More than just set collecting, you must time your Havoc calls properly, and not commit too much to one battle, especially early. Bluffing, like in poker, can backfire on the havoc-caller, so choose your battles wisely!

Only played twice. It's six-card poker with six suits and 18 denominations (plus a joker). The theme is tacked on, but the game is made more interesting by the draw/discard rules and the choice about when to start a battle/score. Getting an extra card for starting a battle is usually worth it.

RATING: 6
Update after some more play: I've knocked my rating down a peg. My first game was fun, but subsequent outings haven't lived up to the inital impression as well as I had hoped. The Dogs of War cards are unwieldy, and the game seems a much more luck-influenced than it first appeared *unless* you spend a colossal (and inappropriate) amount of effort counting cards.

I'd also add my voice to those saying that this really has no relation to poker. Like BattleLine, it uses poker hands because people are familiar with them and they have usful probabilities (probabilities that are a bit skewed here, but still). But this is a memory game, not a game of bluffing, wagering, or probabilities. The game looks like it might have bluffing, but in practice - because the cards are spent regardless of whether you win or not, because the deck is unlikely to recycle much, and because incremental costs are very low after you've already started to break up your sets - I don't think it does.

At the end of the day I'm not quite sure what to make of Havoc. One game was fun; a later game though was really not fun. It's clever, but I really wish there were either more there, either thematically or gameplay-wise, or that it were a lot shorter.
---
Hey! Finally, a genuine small-press game that doesn't suck! Players draft poker hands from available cards, and then compete for points. Reminiscint of both Beowulf and Mermaid Rain. You bid one card at a time, generally, trying to get good hands. The game is in spending your cards efficiently, winning by a little and losing by a lot.

The knocks against the game are just the playing time, which is a bit too long given the rather repetitive nature of the game, and the wacky poker hands. For many the poker rankings are intuitive, but for many they are not, and the expanded ones here (up to 6 cards) can be opaque at times when they should be rapidly internalized. Also, the draft/play mechanics of the game tends to skew the worths of various hands compared to actual poker, so like in BattleLine you're going to need a straight flush to win most big hands and standard straights are worthless (although it seems even moreso here). Probably the biggest thing holding back the game, though, is just that it's so similar in feel and length to Beowulf, but certainly a substantially lesser game.

Anyway, despite this I liked it. I'd like to own a copy. Which leads me to my last complaint ... what's up with the distribution on this one? Why a FunAgain exclusive? I don't shop at FunAgain any more, nor am I likely to do so again in the near future, and I'm not going to go over there just to buy an overpriced small-box card game ($20 for Havoc, plus shipping!, is far too much).

Knizia's Battle Line expanded and improved into a meaty card game.  A poker game with elements of rummy.  Since you keep your cards until the end of the game, you can hold key cards to ensure that your opponents dont get them, much like rummy. 

Played 2, 4, 6 player games.

4 and 6 players excellent.  Not fun with 2, rather play Knizia's Battle Line.

Lots of tension and bluffing and a blast to play.

Once everyone gets on the same page with this one, this is one of the best 4 player games around. Period.  Tense, tight, strategy, tactics and a smidgeon of luck.  It takes 1-2 games for people to understand how to make things work in this game, because you can be repeatedly brutalized, a la Taj Mahal.  Only play if you can win 1st, or play very few cards to take a point here or there.  You can't go all in early and not win.  You will be punished.  Once people figure that out, this is golden.  A real gem.  The only thing holding it back is that with 3, it loses some of it's shine in it's point distribution (even with the variant), and with 6, I can imagine you would be at the mercy of the table in just how many turns you get.  Also, you wouldn't have a reasonable expectation of winning a battle, even with a good hand...might be really brutal.

This game is 6-suit, 6-card poker meets the Hundred Years' War.  It's a fun mid-length game, but despite its relative simplicity, explaining the rules (especially regarding recruiting and use of Dogs of War) can be difficult.  Playing through a sample round is probably the best way of getting around this--after a round or two, the mechanics become easy to understand.  Those with a good memory of played and recruited cards have a distinct advantage.

Let me start by saying I am a big poker fan in general.  This game takes the poker basics and expands them.  Havoc increases the ability to bluff your opponents, adds a drafting mechanism to increases your control over your hand, and implements a resource management aspect by being able to choose your battles and use dogs of war.  All in all if you like poker you should love this game.  If you don't like poker you might still love it.

This is basically poker with card drafting, and someone forfeiting their turn to select face up cards to start the layout of hands. This is done progressively, so people can decide whether they want to stay in based on what others are showing. The reason to not stay in is that cards unplayed stay from hand to hand, and there's no hand limit, so often you have a bit of flexibility in the types of hands you can make. I liked it. I think our game was a bit marred by the rocky start we got. There were a number of points we had a hard time grokking. I don't think I was the only one whose eyes started glazing over as Christopher was reading the rules aloud. I think there's something hypnotic about reading game rules aloud. :-) While playing, though, I couldn't help but think: I'd rather just play Tichu.

Experience: In my one two-player game, I found that each of the basic mechanisms of the game (card draft, set collecting, hand management, bluffing) were enjoyable, but overall the game lacked a bit of spark. My fellow player and I agree that with more players there might be a bit more action.

Players are fighting nine battles of the 100 Years War.  Basically, players take turns recruiting cards to their hand, until someone cracks and declares "Havoc" to begin the next battle.  Battles are played out in semi Stud poker fashion with a six suit deck of cards that can rank up to 18 (depends on number of players).  Battles award different amounts of points for positions, and the points earned escalates during the game.  Easy game to pick up and play, although the Dogs during battle rules are open to interpretation.  Perhaps just a little long, but all in all a nice poker game.  Great medieval presentation.

Excellent poker style game.  This is great with a group of 3-6, but I'm not too impressed with 2 player play.  Make sure to carefully explain the somewhat fiddly Dog rules - the Dog cheat sheet on the publisher's web site is helpful in this regard.

In my opinion this should immediately replace poker as a game, as it is much more colourful and fun. In fact knowing poker helps a lot to get into this game, but the hundred year's battles add a nice flavour to it, and card management is of the essence. The card pictures are beautifully captured from original art, and the game may appeal to geeks and non gamers equally. What doth one wanteth more?

Satisfying poker style game that creates a nice bit of tension (especially the all-or-nothing 8 card) while preparing for battle.  I like how the Havoc caller is rewarded with an extra card even if they don't win the battle, as well as forcing opponents to discard if you keep the peace.  This avoids the game from dragging.  The points available to score (combinations of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) are structured in a way to entice players to play cards even if their hands are weak.  Winning big points can be costly with card depletion so going for lower points is often the better choice.  Fun game!

Very glad I gave this one a shot, and look forward to many more plays.  My copy has become well worn, and I wish I had sleeved it, since it's so hard to find now.  I also have the expansion but never use it and have no interest in doing so.

This was poorly reviewed in counter when it was new as a poor relation to poker, It's not it's much better game than that yes it uses poker type hands to score, but you draft those hands, and deciding which battles to compete in is the real art of the game. My regular group love it and it's playable in an hour!

This is a reasonable game but I was disappointed that it really didn't have much to do with the Hundred Years War, apart from some nice looking cards. At its heart it is a poker variant with a tacked-on theme.

RATING: 5
A mix of Poker, Condottiere, and Knizia's Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship Card Game. You're drafting poker hands for a series of "battles" (the theme, um, let's say it doesn't get in the way much...) in which you win victory points if said hand is good enough (or if you can convince the other players that your hand is good enough and make them drop out).

I cannot really say what's wrong with the game. In fact, it works pretty well. Maybe it's that traditional card game flavour that I'm not too much of a fan of. In any case, the game seems to run a tad too long and lacks some excitement and tension in the battles, possibly because the lines are typically drawn fairly early during the round.

Based on one play. Interesting combination of card drafting and poker, with certain shades of bluffing and gambling. Long-term resource management elements in this type of game are a clever addition, but they clash a bit with the luck-based (especially in the beginning of the game) nature of a card games. Good production value: the cards feel good, the historical facts are a nice addition and the medieval art is very beautiful and fitting.

Nice production from a small company for this one.  On the whole, a good card game, but it didn't 'wow' me.  You either recruit (take cards) or have a battle of bluff and cardplay.  The 'Dogs of War' cards add a nice little touch, since you can apply it to your hand, or use it to scavenge a card from the battlefield to put back in your hand.

RATING: 5
I'm lukewarm on Havoc, but I love the look of the cards!  The primary skill required is memory, which reduces the game's appeal for me.  I didn't think the game played well with a full table of six; too slow and too hard to track what the other players are doing.  It was better with four, with players able to track cards more intelligently.  You need to be able to track cards so that bluffs and aggressive plays are meaningful.  Although I'm not crazy about the game, I would recommend it to those who especially enjoy poker, rummy, and games of hand management.  I enjoy the hand management, but am neither a poker guy nor a rummy guy.

This is fantastic! It's just a small card game so it accompanies me in my travels. I love poker, I really don't like the comparison to poker , they're soooooo different. Sure this uses poker and super poker hands but it appeals to gamers more than gamblers.

Solid game with two excellent mechanisms: the difficult decision to enter or skip a battle and the slow buildup of hands once battle begins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played once with six players; rating may go up as we better understand the game. Would score higher if the theme were better integrated into the mechanics -- we spent our whole time evaluating suits and values and the relationships of a six-card poker hand and didn't have the cycles to notice if we were playing arbalests or battle kings or whatever. Vaguely similar to the under-appreciated Condottiere as you must manage your hand through a series of battles, knowing when to fight and when to fade. The Dog cards add an interesting dynamic and I suspect their proper use is the key to victory.

The comparison to poker is inescapable.  Players gather cards and attempt to form poker-like hands (pairs, three or four-of-a-kind, straights, full houses, etc.), which will be used in the ensuing battles.  A significant difference is that a hand consists of six cards as opposed to the standard five-card poker hand.  Further, cards are not revealed all at once, but rather are played in a piecemeal fashion, with players continuing or dropping out as the card-playing cycle continues around the table.  This is similar to many card-driven games, including Condotierre and Taj Mahal.  Indeed, the entire game consists of mechanisms lifted from other titles, and there is little very original here.  Still, the blending of these mechanisms does result in a pleasing game.

I quite enjoy Havoc, and do enjoy the tidbits of historical information on the cards.  While there is nothing really original here, the final mixture is entertaining.  That is high praise from someone who doesn’t enjoy poker!

What a great little game in a small package.  It has mechanics that almost everyone already understands (poker) yet it adds enough "gamer" elements to mix things up.  It scales very well from 3 to 6, it's nice to see that such attention was put into tweaking the gameplay so that the entire range of players works.  (I haven't tried it with 2 yet.)  The only downside is that it's a Funagain exclusive, and I hate shopping from Funagain (all the cost of a brick and mortar with none of the convenience.)

I like the drafting mechanism, variable point award system and the bluffing aspect.  When I first found the game, I immediately wanted to buy the expansion characters, but after a few 4p games I think that they are not necessary and may bring too much chaos.    My initial thoughts got confirmed today when we had a chance to play a few games with the Expansion Characters.  In my opinion, Havoc is MUCH better without these cards.  

I have had an opportunity to play 5p and 6p games this weekend and I think that 5p is a perfect spot for Havoc in our group.  With six, it starts to drag on, especially if you have one slower player.  However, if all the players are experienced than 6p may be even better.

RATING: 7
Based on a first play which I enjoyed despite a number of reservations. The theme of Havoc really appeals to me but I see little, if any, integration of the theme into the game itself. The Dogs of War are a nice thematic touch but don't seem to work well as a game mechanism. The game was a little too long and, as a non-poker player, the rankings of the card combinations were non-intuitive so that I frequently had to refer to the player aid. However, I think that repeat playings of the game would breed familiarity with the rankings and reduce the game length.

I was originally  a little disappointed because from some of the early descriptions I was expecting this to be like a more complex multiplayer Battle Line which it is not.

 Sadly, the game fell a little flat playing with only 2 players.  However, after playing again with more players this is a game I would definitely recommend for 3 or more and have upped my rating. I am looking forward to playing again.

This is a great game which I often describe as the marriage between Gin and War. Rules are simple (though explaining the Dogs of War for the first time can be a bit of a chore) but the potential strategy is deep and keeps you on your toes since you can't totally predict how any given game is going to run.

There's enough strategy to give you control of the game, but enough luck of the draw so that it keeps things interesting. My only major problem with it is that it can sometimes drag when people are hoarding cards and playing too conservatively. Even when it does drag though, I still enjoy playing it since it has mechanics that keep it from dragging too much. Highly recommended.

RATING: 5
Havoc is a variation on poker. Players play 9 consecutive hands, each hand representing a battle of the Hundred Years War. On their turn, they decide to draw cards (draft troops) or wage war, i.e. to play the hand. Each player now decides if he enters the battle or passes to save his strength for another battle. The highest hand wins the battle card, usually one or more hands score points as well.

The medieval card art is appealing. The decision to draw more cards or wage war as well as the one about joining the battle are interesting. Where Havoc disappointed, is the actual poker battle. On paper, the wealth of possible hands, enhanced by the joker cards called ‘dogs of war’ sounds juicy. In reality, it boils down to collecting the same numbers as much as possible as they are the only way to get high ranks with few cards. Six cards straight or flush lose to simple full houses. The bluffing takes a back seat. The rules confusion caused by the dogs of war is at least as high as their added value to the game. Bummer, I rather play Taj Mahal for the hand management aspect or real poker for the bluffing.

Definitely worth playing again, and hopefully with as many as possible.

It feels like multi-player Battle Line or Schotten-Totten.  There are several Victory Points Cards ("wars") to be awarded for playing the best 6 suited poker-styled hands.

Rated after one six-player game. I won that game so that may have skewed my rating. I enjoy the progressive bluffing and point taking. I am finding that I really like card battles and drafting mechanics. The Dogs of War card mechanic was kind of awkward in my opinion, I only ever got one other than the starting card so I probably don't fully appreciate it. I want to try it again with different numbers or people to see how it scales. Heck I'd love to play it some more in general.

Is this game the second coming of Poker?  Well, no.  But it is a good variation on the mechanics of Poker and a well designed game in its own right.  Some minor drawbacks include AP when decided whether to take part in a battle or not, and minor confusion on how the dogs work in battle/timing issues.  Also, the rulebook is horrible.  I have tried it with 2, 3 and 6.  Did not like it with 2, and 6 takes a bit long.  3 was best, but 4-5 is probably the sweet spot.

A hand management / drafting poker-hand game that resembles Condotierre without all the chaotic screwage cards.  It's a nice design and there are some decisions to make regarding whether or not to sit out a battle, thus earning no points but earning an extra card while others are depleting their hands OR get into the battle hoping to pull out a victory by playing the best hand (or at least something that will earn VPs (often 2nd or 3rd, best hand, will earn victory points too)).

This one is really excellent. It brings in elements of poker (although you have to learn some new funky "hands" and where they fit in to the rankings), and also bluffing and longer strategy. Between this and Schotten-Totten (the other 'poker-esque' card game), ST is faster to learn and play, but this one just seems a lot more fun, with only slightly more effort to get into.  (although, i'm still not sure that I learned how to properly use the Dogs of War exactly)

RATING: 7
A card game that uses a range of poker hands (and new options) to help decide the winners of key battles in the said war. A ranking hand displays the power of each hand, so players must collect cards before the next battle to help create a hand they think can win. As in poker, bluff and double bluff are key elements and the game is an enjoyable 'filler' game experience.

And yet this game didn't see the light of play for well over a year. Off to a math trade it went.

I've played this over 15 times now and have enjoyed the game each time I've played it.  I'm usually not a big card game fan, but this one hits the spot for me, due to the strong theme and beautiful artwork (original medieval artwork from the Pierpont Morgan library bible, game components and historical accuracy of the multiple battles of the Hundred Year War (detailed history of each battle on back of each card....).

You must pick your battles well and plan ahead for the final two battles thru adept recruiting and attempt to carefully follow what weapons and forces the other players are recruiting and playing in battles.  Dogs of War have multiple uses and are a neat additional element to the game which allows you to go after cards on the battlefield or discard pile that you need to complete your hands (unique six-suited poker hands).  First time players almost always seem to lose this game and the experienced players win out, confirming that it has depth and is a challenge to pull out a victory.  Game adjusts for number of players from 2-6 very well....Like it with 3 especially...  "Cry Havoc and Let Slip the Dogs of War!!" 

I'm getting better with more play and winning more often.  Very satisfying to win this game.

RATING: 7
Draft cards into your hand, then when somone initiates combat, play out six card poker hands to score points. There are 9 total combats, and generally the first through third best poker hands will score points. You can try to save cards for the combats at the end, but you can also initiate combat to force the issue. Great plus for this game is that you can play with 2 to 6 players. I'm constantly amazed at the inventiveness with what people can do with an old theme. Rating may tend upwards with more play.

Very nice mix of six-suit Showdown-style poker and Taj Mahal.  The theme is pudding, the hand rankings are well thought-out, and the game is challenging in terms of deciding which rounds are worth going-for-broke and which are better spent in the bushes; like poker, the strategy deepens with increased knowledge of the players.  This game is the perfect gateway game for your poker buddies, looking for something different.

Havoc was just that, havoc. Good collections were easy to get, so again, it's a guessing game - do they have what it takes to beat me and will they want to beat me this turn.

Based on one play: A nice little card game. This is one of those games were you cannot win every round, but have to chose your battles and try to get second, third or fourth place some times rather then always going for first. Obviously, when someone calls for a battle, they will likely have a good hand and if well played, you may not realize it till you have wasted a bunch of cards. There is enough luck, but still, the game is fun nonetheless.

Initial rating based on 2P experience.  Rating might go up with more players and experience.  A game of hand management and deciding when to "battle".  The ability to retrieve cards via the Dogs of War adds an interesting twist.

Essentially a set collecting game where you have to know when to commit your limited cards so you don't throw you best combination away without any points.

Also it drives me up the wall that so many gamers say this game is poker-like.  It is not.  It has none of the bluffing and betting aspects of poker.  It it is a game of hand management.

This game uses poker-like combinations in a rummy-like/card drafting game--this game is a close cousin to Whisky Poker:  http://www.pagat.com/commerce/whisky_poker.html

It's kind of Poker and Condottiere rolled into one. However, unlike Condottiere there's usually second place points to be had, which doesn't make the battles such all or nothing affairs.

Havoc immediately brings to mind Taj Mahal, and fits into the same slot as San Juan regarding components and quickness.

Combined with the tiered payoff mechanism and you get a neat little game. Better than it seems like it should be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played once with 3P. The nicest – and worst – thing I can say about Havoc is that it is totally inoffensive. Players draw cards in a rummy-style fashion, and cry havoc when they think the time is right. Players then form poker-like hands, with the highest ranking hand winning the battle. 

The most interesting bit about the game is the decision on whether to decline a battle in favour of conserving resources for a future round. But that element is also implemented in [thing=67888][/thing], which is a richer game overall. There is also an element of memory and a little tension as hands form, but again, nothing particularly new enough which hasn't been covered by other games. Havoc is certainly playable, but it's also painfully ordinary.

Rant On: Someone tell me why this is a Funagain Exclusive. What gives? Rio Grande gave monopoly of Carc: Discovery to ONE them. Now Sunriver too!

Funagain and Sunriver are risking the ire of numerous consumers over financial and distribution convenience. They are essentially forcing consumers to buy from one place instead of their usual channels.

Rant off.

Set in the 100 years war period, players draft cards (troops, weapons, etc) in an attempt to build up poker-inspired hands for battling. 9 battles happen over the course of a game and the player who gains the most VPs wins.

The drafting mechanism is ok but a little constrained. The bluff battle aspects works fairly well.

The 6 suited hands can get a little confusing but nothing the player aids on the Sunriver website can't fix.

The Dogs are a neat thematic twist and are useful. However, they might be a little on the 'strong' side.

Knowing when to battle and what to battle for is important as you don't want to be left with little cards going into the last 2 battles.

The quality is great for an indie startup.

I have only been able to play this with 2 and 3 players and I am dying to try it with more.  So far, however, the gameplay seems to be lacking just that little something...  

I enjoy the cards and the VPs and the playing of the battles, but it seems easy for the game to get a little bit stalled, with players waiting for the perfect card to get their hands going.  Some good decisions to be made there, though, with respect to the play of 5-6 card hands that will take VPS, but leave your hand barren for future battles.

Not much to this game.  Relies on the poker mechanics too much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a totally OK card game where it takes a Condottiere/Meuterer like bidding system and mixes it in with Poker hands.  With as many types of combos available I was hoping that there was a way to bait and switch in this, by leading with one potential and following it up with a different combo.  You can kind of do this, but I don't think it will disuade people from playing what they will once they've committed.  Laying down two cards is just such a heavy buy in that you might as well go for it.  I feel that Meuterer succeeds where this fails.  

Not to say that this is a bad card game, but I also feel that you are going to draft the obvious choice, strangely what to discard seems to be the deepest decision in this game.

I really think that turn order bones the player to the right of the Peacekeeper.  Quite often they are stuck drawing blindly.

Overall, this is a card game, a bad hand is a bad hand, but unlike most card games, you don't just clear and get new cards you are stuck with crap for the game constantly hoping that something will roll your way.  In some regards I like this as this makes for a deeper sense of hand management instilling resposibility to time your actions, but there isn't much of an out if things aren't going your way.

The cards are quite beautiful, but the play for the most part was not evocotive of much.  I tried to spice things up by frantically wooting while announcing what was being laid out or drafted, but that couldn't make the game all that exciting.  No tension, no excitement. Final result: Bland.

Hmmm. The morning after the game and nothing to gloat about. A great concept that falls a bit flat in the execution. Maybe it had something to do with my strategy (I came in fourth out of six) but I felt very very limited in my choices from round to round. With so many cards - 18 x 6 suites + 12 Dogs or War it felt very chaotic. That is a tremendous deck for a poker hybrid. And 17 or 18 cascading card combinations? Again, too much. I would play again because I love card games but initial impressions are 'Ugh' and 'Snore'.

This game, at its heart, is a poker variant with a couple of other old mechanics thrown in to create a simple and fairly interesting game.  What is most unique is the theme, which of course is just "pasted on" anyhow.  In fact, it is so thinly pasted on, that (as another astute user pointed out) the actual artwork in the game depicts soldiers wearing armor from at least a century prior to the commencement of the Hundred Years War.  Of course, this is only an issue for those of us who have a particular interest in the history of that period!  All in all, I'd say this is a great game to introduce to your average non-board gaming "Texas Hold 'Em" player as an introduction to other types of games.  And the biggest compliment that I can give it is that I don't enjoy most card games outside of poker and euchre, but I enjoyed playing this particular card game.  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: 6
Good game.  It has less in common with poker than with gin.  Card counting and timing your plays are what is important.  The big poker skills (betting, bluffing, hand reading, people reading, and a little bit of math) are almost completely useless here.  I think the group I played with thinks I won because I'm a reasonably good poker player, but really I just drew a dog of war every other time I drew a card.  I had fun, though I am worried about the replay value, considering how long it takes to play.  Also, it is apparently impossible to find.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit, although we learned quickly that allowing any one player to grab a big point card uncontested (and thus not expend many cards for the big gain) is tantamount to handing him the game. Has some elements reminiscent of Taj Mahal and is even more evocative of Knizia's Der Herr der Ringe: die Zwei Türme das Kartenspiel, a little card game that has flown under the radar screen but which I also quite enjoy. I think further playing will likely reveal that bluffing is a solid strategy in Havoc, adding some interesting options and enhancing replayability. The theme works well, and everone seemed to enjoy being able to Cry 'Havoc' and Let Slip the Dogs of War!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Havoc uses nine poker hands as the source of conflict for modern gamers.  It's simple; either draw or call for a conflict.  There's a dash of Taj Mahal in that players who commit to battle will lose their played cards whether they win or not.  The gameplay works but the art is dreary; it's as much a missed opportunity as Battle Line and frankly, warrants a reprint.  The reference cards are quite valuable for non-poker players.  Havoc plays six, which is a big bonus.

A spin-off of poker with more ranks and suits.  On a turn, a player either adds two cards to their hand and discards one, or he cries "Havoc!", which means that they want to play out a poker hand consisting of six cards.  There are nine battles (poker hands) to be played in the game, usually with several players scoring points for the hand.  Most points at the end of the last battle wins!

I bought this at BGG.CON.  This is a good game with alot of tension.  It is often compared to poker, but I think it is an enourmously better game than that.  You have time to build up your hand and plan.  You keep the same hand throughout the game, so you have to be able to win the current battle while retaining useful cards for the next.  You have to carefully pick your battles.  When a battle starts, you don't just lay your hand down, instead you build it up a few cards at a time.  In my last game, I was able to play a suited 8 and 9.  There had been alot of competition for a battle on the previous turn, so only one other player was willing to take a risk it.  That 8 and 9 was all I had, but I was able to get second place with it.  Bluffing is certainly part of regular Poker, but you have alot more control over it in this game.  The only real problem with the game is that it tends to run a little long.

I like this game a lot.  I have a healthy respect for Poker, but I know that I'll never be able to make a living playing it, so I stay away.  This game gives me a good Poker fix without the fear of losing all of my belongings.

1play. 3players. A card game. I don't like card games that much and this wasn't much of an exception. Sure it has got some "strategic" elements but not for me thanks.

I can do fairly well at Taj Mahal, but this one takes a couple of games to really get the strategy involved.  It's important to start planning for the last two battles from the beginning of the game, and knowing when to get involved with battles and when to avoid them.  Very elegant.

1 play: 5 players
2 plays: 6 players

A solid card game with combat fought on the basis of hands similar to those found in Poker.  You must decide whether to try for first, second, or third place in many of the battles which gain you points for the win.  Hand management is critical as is knowing which battles to fight for and when to bow out of a losing hand.  Thumbs up on this one.

Havoc: the Hundred Years War is a card game where players compete in a series of battles by recruiting soldiers to form sets (poker hands) to win victory points. The Dogs of War are used to retrieve soldiers from the battlefield or to draw extra resources. After 8 skirmishes a final battle ends the game and crowns a new king based on total victory points.

Fun card game. It uses poker-like melds to define winners so it is a card set collecting game.

Hastily slapped-on theme.  Clunky Dogs of War mechanics.  It's really just another poker variant with a cool scoring mechanism.

If you want to play Poker-Plus, go with Battleline.

I am stunned by how enjoyable this is.  Sure, the theme is utterly dispensible, but it makes it a far prettier game than if it had been a simple six-suited, warped poker game.  And - oh! - how warped it is.  I'm trying to find words to describe it, and I can't yet.  I guess I'll have to revisit these comments to turn them into something worth reading.

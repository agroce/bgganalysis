Got this from a friend who paid a buck at a yard sale. I think that means he overpaid by three bucks. Not a *bad* game, but any trivia game from the mid to late 80s that isn't called "Trivial Pursuit" has to be given negative rating demerits for even trying.

Man, am I ever terrible at this game.  I consider myself pretty bright, but something about this style of game always gets me.  

The game is fun, and of course pretty simple to learn.  Some of the category choices are a little peculiar, but otherwise it was okay.  Nothing to get too too excited about (to me).

I feel this game is much better than the average Geek rating. There are strong strategic elements and unique scoring. I think this game's ratings suffers from three biases here at  the Geek: Age, Commonness and Trivia. It dates to the early 60s. While the one year younger Acquire is deservedly highly ranked, it is an exception to the bias against age. Common games, those seen often at the thrift store or yard sale also tend to get low rankings. Finally, trivia games are poorly regarded, I think because they are automatically viewed as so dominated by existing knowledge and less by in the moment strategic decisions. 

FiF has an important strategic element: the selection of categories by each player. When a player picks a card he/she can decide which category appears to give the best net gain against the opponents. This strategic elements means that even in a 2 person game, the game works very well. Most trivia games are less fun with only 2 because they are mostly party games. 

Finally, the game lends itself to easy addition of variations. The rule book of the AH edition has several. We are planning on the addition of a 'matching answers means no points for either' among others.

Give this game a try, I think you'll be surprised how well you like it.

Box shows some shelf wear, mostly at corners.  Contains 30 letter tiles (26 alphabet tiles and 4 * wild tiles), 55 class cards, a 31 page pad on the master score card, a 130 play card pad, and a two minute timer that is not original to the game.  The timer is glass with blue sand and a "Made in Germany" sticker on the bottom.  There is also a 6 page loose ruleset in conjunction with the ruleset printed inside the lid of the inner box.  A half page "How to Score" document is also included, although it is stained near the top.  Everything else is in great condition.

A game that I think surpasses Scattergories, and yet it came out first.  I just like the way it challenges my mind to think of multiple topics at the same time.  And because of the variety you can skip categories that you are weak in and jump to your strengths.  The only problem is that some of the categories are showing their age significantly.

It's a trivia-type game that's been described as a variation of Scattergories but with better scoring.  I'm not a fan of trivia games.  I also wasn't fond of the categories or the crazy nuances that someone could impose on the categories... but as a buddy of mine says, you can always make up your own categories.

RATING: 4
An oldie but goodie.  A race to name one of five different categories (using the correct first letter) before time runs out.  The game is fun on its own but the list of categories conceived in the 1960s (e.g. types of oboes) makes the game even more fun.

RATING: 2
Facts in Five is one of those party games that works only as a long as you stay in a good zone (this is not uncommon for this sort of game; Balderdash is another example where once people figure out that the game is in mimicking the linguistic style of the definitions included in the game, it gets pretty tedious). Anyway, after a little bit of play most gamers will figure out that Facts in Five is mostly about making shit up and then convincing the other players it's right. You have to have the baseline of being right often enough so people don't just ignore you, but the game is won and lost in the diplomacy of convincing people that your answers are right and other people's are wrong. This then goes to a very bad place (I was once in a game where someone managed to convince the table that Robert Frost was not an American Poet).

In this age of the Internet, you could probably actually verify answers instead of going to the diplomacy part of the game. But, that's not the game as-designed.

Now, I'm sure plenty of groups enjoy this and are able to avoid the slippery slope to degeneracy, keeping the social dynamics positive. Especially for hobbyist gamers, though, it can be tough.
---
Like Set, this seems to be a game that rewards thinking in very counter-logical ways, which doesn't do a lot for me. Plus, the meat of the game seems to be in arguing over all the marginal answers (usually, over 50% of them). Not somthing I'll ever play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Teams are given five different categories, as well as 5 different letters where they have to think of an answer starting with those letters for that category.  So, for example, you may have to think of TV shows, starting with F, S, T, U, and B, answering Friends, Scrubs, That 70's Show, etc.

After 5 minutes, points are scored, with more points awarded for the more answers provided in each row and column.

A very similar game to Scattergories, which more people may be familiar with.  However, in Facts in Five, you may get some awfully obscure categories where almost no one knows anything!

Still believe this is one of the best trivia games ever made -- fun and fast-paced, plus you can make the categories as interesting and as difficult as you like. Only flaw is that the group has to be the right one, with a common understanding of allowable answers. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Skewed towards Americana.  The rules need to be made clear before starting, especially the section on Key Words.  Also, some of the classes, and indeed categories, can be quite ambiguous.  Not as stupid as most party games, but one that will nevertheless be dominated by the trivia hounds.

I grew up playing this game and really love it, but my husband is only luke warm to it.  The scoring method forces you to choose carefully where you spend your brain power during the limited time given.  Fun to play either in teams or as individuals, it works wonderfully for any number of players.  I have played the newer, similar game Scattergories a couple times, and just don't like it as well.  The biggest difference between the games is that the categories in Facts and Five are very challenging, so it is mostly a game of testing your own mental agility.  The categories in Scattegories are easy, but you must come up with a unique answer that noone else does, so it is mostly a game of second-guessing.

Picked it up at my favorite thrift store. I feared the worse since it was an old game and, although the box looked OK, it was wrapped twice around with wide, clear packing tape (Ugh).

Got it out to car and carefully cut the tape open and it was 100% complete and "unpunched" (it has perfed cardboard letters and they had not been separated), it had complete scorepads (no sheets used), and even had Avalon Hill catalog's and inserts, ca. 1976.

Oh yeah, I figured defacing the box probably wouldn't be any worse than leaving the ugly tape on it, so I carefully tried peeling the tape of the back of the box and I was able to completely remove all of the tape without defacing the printing at all!

Success! (and only $2)

Not sure why my family loves this game so much, but we do.  We started making up our own categories for it 15 years ago and over that time period it's our most played game by FAR.

I think it's the non-competitive aspect that appeals to my family.  Plus, there's something enjoyable about coming up with wacky categories and then racing against the clock to come up with as many correct "answers" as possible.

Anyone who misspent his youth in libraries and book stores will like the idea of this game, although the implementation can be dislikable with a disputatious crowd, namely, a bunch of lawyers. Accordingly, I rate it lower than I used to. It's better than Scattergories because you score for the depth of your knowledge within a category and for the breadth of your knowledge across categories, not for answers that no one else writes down. However, you do not completely avoid the irritating off-the-wall answers that produce so many disputes in Scattergories.

After one play, I hated this game because "what counts" is often unclear and subject to infinite disagreement. So I rated it a 3.

With an extremely liberal (but self-consistent) interpretation of "what counts", this could be a 7.

I want to like Facts in Five, but the specialized, often obscure categories and the elaborate scoring system make it unsuitable for casual play with non-gamers or party gamers.

A party/trivia game that plays like Scattergories for Mensa. Each player draws a card that has a mandatory class (large subject) and optional choice of category (specific sub-subject). These are selected and read aloud for five categories. Then, 5 letter tiles are drawn at random. Once the timer starts, everyone must think of 5 answers that fit each category, one for each letter. The categories can become quite obscure by themselves, but then having the added difficulty of beginning with a particular letter can make it nearly impossible. Definitely interesting, though, and actually kind of fun. More open-ended than most trivia games, but still rather difficult.

I think it says something about a game when you remember how much you loved it even though you were a kid playing against adults -- especially when it's a quiz game where kids have a serious disadvantage.  But what was great about FIF was that the game scaled nicely, since there is no real QUESTION to answer right or wrong as in, say, Trivial Pursuit.  You try to pick a Class and Category that you know a bit about, and then you draw your letters (luck really comes into play here) and then you get to show off what you know.  You get to empty your head onto the answer pad.  And then the great social aspect of FIF that is missing from other trivia games is going around the table after the timer has run out, reading back your answers to the group.  No other game has given me a similar experience.  If you were clever enough to think of an answer for a letter nobody else got, you feel like a real champ, and everybody laughs and says "GOOD ONE!"  And the answers frequently start discussions, some about the validity of your answer, but some about the topic (class and category) you were answering in.  So if the topic was TV shows and you got the letter "C" and you say "Courtship of Eddie's Father" and everybody goes, "OH MAN!  I remember that show!  Who was the Japanese lady that played the housekeeper?  Did you know the little kid on that show became a punk rocker?"  It's awesome.  When I was a kid playing with my older sisters and sometimes my parents, the game always ALWAYS was over too soon, even though it took well over an hour to play.

I've lost the box, but I still have the cards, letters and scorepads.  I used to enjoy this as a game to play with non-gamers, but now I'm bored by it.  It would be somewhat less boring if we could make up fun categories for all five. ¶ I don't see that the package adds much to the free paper-and-pencil version. It's no fun unless players agree to choose categories that are reasonable for everyone, and you can do that without the card deck. For the letters you can just agree to cycle through the alphabet.

Scattagories on steroids.  Dynamite in a stainless steel wordplay drum.  The more players the better.  Always fun...even when one member of our regular group picks ridiculous, obscure categories that no one knows about -- like pre-1950s European opera singers – for in that dark moment, you can use your time to verbally assault and shame him for his asinine category selection.

Watch for the competition to become especially fierce as the leaders start heading for the finish line.

This is a bit dated, to be certain, but this game has found a good niche in our gaming group.

The trivia knowledge is limited to finding items with the names beginning with one of five letters (or a wildcard) picked out at random.  The topics are chosen by the players by selecting cards from a deck, but the game is dated by the topics themselves; trivia pertaining to items more recent than the 1960's are not to be found.

Crazy sort of trivia game. First, everyone gets a random card of topics and chooses one topic. Then somebody draws five letters at random. Then players have five minutes to write down something that starts with each letter for each topic, and you score the square of the number of things you successfully named. But scoring is even more ridiculous as you also score for your breadth of "knowledge".

This game just stresses me out. Timed thinking coupled with remembering words that are always on the tip of my tongue (but never remembered) really just makes me feel like I'm just stabbing my hand with a fork repeatedly for 5 minutes. Though when I read the timer is for five minutes, I remember it as being like 30 seconds. Also, I almost always ran out of time on big tests in class. So, it's not really nice when I play a game and that's all I can think about. It's too bad, because I like the kind of questions it asks and the associations it brings up. I played the classic version, the newer version sounds horrible. The classic version had interesting topics, which the new version labels as "esoteric".

Worth having it for the occasional play, but it doesn't get to the table very often.

After a few plays it becomes very repetitive.  The game is not mentally challenging and isn't light-hearted fun either.  Kind of like working on an assembly line.

As far as trivia/party games goes, this continues to be an long-standing favorite.  It's easy to explain, fun to play, and lasts as long as you want it too.  The General nature of the cards/categories also makes it timeless.

Anything that this game does, Scattergories does better. Scattergories has more interaction, better categories, better streamlining, and more strategy and psychology.

Five cards are drawn. Each card contains a "class" and a list of "categories". A category is selected for each class and the players and five letter tiles are drawn. The players have 5 minutes to come up with an example that begins with each letter for each class/category.

Classic AH word/category game ... Still fun to pull off of the shelf once in a while.

This is a great game but it is seriously in need of an update - gender equality would be a great starting point.

The original, forget knockoffs like scattergories. A great, adabptable game for any type of player. If you're playing with some one younger or more inebriated you can choose simple categories with no subcategory, or if you're trying to prove your intelligence you can pick obscure category combinations and see if either player tops 23 points.

Brother to Scattergories, this title is essentially a commercialized version of a party game which I can enjoy (and do enjoy) for free.  So I've never actually played it.  But it did come with a fascinating time caplsule of a mid-70's Avalon Hill catalog.

My brother and I played this game "to death" back in the 60s/70s.  Still own my original copy!  I think it would work pretty good today, since the categories are wide open (you could even create your own category cards) and you just need the alphabet chits and a scorecard.

This was one of my favorite party games as a kid.  I haven't played in a long, long time, but glad I save this one.

First Play - 3 players. This is very similar to Scattegories and I don't care for Scattegories.
The scoring system in this is a bit better. You have 2 other players "grade" your answers and any unverified ansmwers are put up to a vote. The game is supposed to be played over 5 rounds but that is too long to sit though. We played 2 rounds and that was plenty for me.

My rating is based on two sessions only. But so far I really like this game. I enjoy this type thinking game under the pressure of the clock. Enjoy the interaction that some of the really 'out there' answers. The fun factor is good.

The game itself seems like it is a good one [as far as I can tell] for people who like naming items in a given category within a certain amount of time. I do not.

This is a family favorite.  We play it when we can and it is easy to teach non-gamers how to play.  It has such a great element of choice that almost anyone can jump right in, play and do quite well.  I would say, "Buy this game."

After 5+ Plays: I love trivia, and this is one of the better trivia games.  It's similar to Scattergories but with more objective categories -- e.g. "living american novelists", instead of "things at the beach".

This feels a lot like Arkham Horror/Eldritch Horror if you are working alone to beat the other players. On top of that, the characters aren't just varied in abilities. They play asymmetrically, even all having their own special dice. Add in the fact that there is no "doom track" to end the game before you've completed all your tasks and this is a fun, theme-filled trek through a fantasy world. The competitive nature of the game is there, but is not so "That That!" that it'll push others away. Solid title.

Huge Witcher fan here. I do think the game captures the crap-sack nature of the world pretty well. Unfortunately, none of my group had even heard of the series and couldn't get into it.

I end up playing it on Steam if I'm in the mood to play this.

RATING: 5
This is a purely a pick-up and deliver game with a Witcher theme and really harsh obstacles thrown in. It's okay.

The PC game adaptation is actually better IMO, because the game is already a single player experience (very low interaction). Throw some music effects and let the computer do all the book-keeping, and it's an entertaining point-and-click puzzle. The board game? Meh.

RATING: 2
I played 3 full games of the beta on GOG. My opinion is entirely based on THAT version. I am unaware of any rules or mechanics changes to the final board game. I was so thoroughly underwhelmed by this game that I blame it as being one of my triggers for my clinical depression. When I heard this was coming out I was so excited, a new fantasy adventure board game by an established and accomplished designer.

"Holy shit, this is going to be amazing" I thought.

Unfortunately, I could not find anything really enjoyable about the game. It had no real driving force or feeling, the "narrative" that occurs feels clunky and disjointed, zero player interaction, bland gameplay, and an overall feeling of emptiness. Worst of all, the quests that you go on - you know the entire point of the game- all feel the same. Regardless if they are combat, diplomacy, or magic, they all require the same skill and "strategy" all the same. It quickly makes the entire experience very tedious rather than adventurous. 

I will not be purchasing this game, under any circumstance. In fact, I cancelled my pre-order of it. However, if someone else owned it, and enjoyed it, and I respected their opinions, and - a lot of conditions here- if I have the right beer, than I might play the physical version, if only to see if they improved anything after the beta. Otherwise this is a strong pass for me, and nothing I can recommend to anyone other than a casual mass market fan who love the IP blindly enough to just buy it for that sake and not really play it.

As someone who does not know the background stories and/or videogames associated with this title, I was still able to enjoy the game's highly story driven elements.  Game play is straight forward and consists of mostly action selection (you get 2 / turn) and a resolution of the 'trouble in your neck of the woods'.  The game allows for some cooperation and rewards a player for helping another along, but is basically played out as individual players.  The game seems pretty well balanced - meaning any character can achieve victory.  The story that emerges from the game play can be compelling if you take the time to enjoy the flavor.  In the end - it's a race to complete tasks and collect the right resources along the way.  The fastest player may not win, but will certainly set the bar for the others.

As a aside, but related note... the tablet version (Android at least)  is [i][u]extremely[/u][/i] well done and is a great substitute for the cardboard.

Played Beta version online.  Very good game!  I do have some concerns but I expect these may be addressed in the full version.  Looking for more interactivity here.  Update:  There is almost no interactivity in the game, though 'support' quests are a good addition.  The computer version takes out fiddliness, and unfortunately without that, the game is simply too long for being as luck driven as it is.  I know it is a story game rather than a strategy game ... but overall frustrating and just not my cup of tea for the length required.

TWAG's action-taking mechanic is reason enough to add this game to any collection. That's not to say the game is perfect. There's a lot more penalty than reward, and there's no cure for cold dice. I'd like to see more hero characters than the 4 included, and surely a defeated monster should result in some reward. However, I really enjoy this game. Action management is key, so is penalty management as wounds and foul fate tokens start piling up.

El juego pretende ser muy complejo, pero en realidad simplemente es muuuuuuuy lento. No tienes que pensar mucho que hacer y simplemente te paseas por el tablero y vas actualizando los encuentros, guerra,etc. Lo unico que le salva es meterse en la piel de los personajes.
No digo que sea malo, simplemente me parece que es demasiado largo

ok rating based on the pc version

A lot of dice rolling and drawing cards.With the mechanic of finding clues convert them into points.This takes serious time.Its manageable in the app but i think this boardgame with these aspects will be a very bad time hog.Its possible my rating will eventually drop becouse of this if i play the boardgame version.

Be carefull with this definetely try it before you buy it.

My friend bought it.He is a witcher fan.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
I didn't have high going in because of all the poor buzz, but gave it a shot since I love Ignacy's games so much.  There is more that is clever here than I initially thought, and at the end of the day it had a neat mix of Robinson Crusoe mixed with Talisman.  Unfortunately, the combo just doesn't seem to work well, and the game gets repetitive quickly.  Not something I need to own, but wouldn't mind playing again if someone asked, even though the game is a bit too long for what it is.  Also, seems like there could be a ton of downtime even in a 3 player game, so its probably best to stick with 2.

The Witcher is a decent game, that suffers from a mechanic/theme disconnect, and pacing issues. It is imo also tactically slightly too shallow.

Ignacy made the heroes distinct and flavourful and still offered some balance between them. The Quests have fitting flavour text and offer space for roleplay, but mechanically they are generic and very samey. This is also true for the foul fate and skill cards.

One of my biggest problems with the game are the leads: You get leads by travelling/investigating. To solve quests you need these and the right colors. Since not every location offers the same colors you need to visit specific locations to get the desired tokens. So if your quest as Geralt is to kill a mage who is ravaging some poor villagers you need 6 red tokens. So you might be travelling in weird circles and collect these tokens. Or have a completely unrelated investigation and meet some unrelated people, which allows you to finally kill the mage. This sounds like an exercise in nihilism and ... it is. To add insult to injury it doesn't even matter if you kill him in the end! The quest is solved just by paying the tokens.

Mechanically it's fine. It's a race to solve certain quests first and gain as many points as possible along the way. You get to make enough interesting decisions along the way. Do you solve sidequests? Which quests of other characters will you support (this has the best leads/VP ratio!)? How you can maneuver the land as good as possible to avoid foul fate and slay as much monsters as possible for points. How do you get in the way of the other heroes?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Oh dear, what a disappointment. I'm not familiar with the witcher universe so I have no idea how well this portrays it, but as a game it sucks :(

It's your usual wander around leveling up pseudo-rpg, but mostly competitive (you can complete side quests of other players to give you both VP but why would you bother?).

Boils down to draw the top card of the deck, roll some dice, either good stuff happens or bad stuff happens. If you get going then it rolls along and you complete your quest, get a new one etc - if you stumble on a bad monster early on, or get some poor draws you get wounded, get slowed down and watch the other players develop and progress as you stumble around.

All in all - pretty obvious decisions mixed with tons of randomness, ending with an unpleasant mix of tedium and frustration. 

Doubt I'd be convinced to play it again.

Don't listen to the naysayers, this game is solid. The asymmetric nature of the characters is enjoyable the game flows and the components are second to none. The game nudges Talisman into the shade, if you are looking to push cubes this is not for you but if you want a game somewhere between Talisman and Eldritch Horror then The Witcher will serve you well.

Runebound The Witcher edition. Seriously? This is the best you give the Witcher license? I'm not a big fan of The Witcher but if you use a system from a game that is basically multiplayer solo original IP WoW that "kills" Talisman by adding so much downtime nobody cares after two turns and iconography that makes Race for the Galaxy blush you fail. This is slightly better with the iconography however so it's a 3 not a 2.

This game is slightly above average. Which means I usually won't suggest to play it but I'm not against it either.

The game looks good overall. Nice colorful board without being hard to see important information. The minis are nice but not important, card artwork is good too. Good looking game overall but it doesn't really excel at any part.

The gameplay gives me similar feeling as the appearance. Good but nothing standout.
I feel a player round is really short which is good on one hand because the downtime is low on the other hand it is bad because you almost always move and chose on another action. I think my choices are too limited also during gameplay I didn't feel the witcher theme. I felt like I'm only collecting red, purple and blue clues.
And the  I had one big problem, usually I ended up with a better situation if I haven't killed the monster in my location. This way I could count what I will face exactly and the reward was almost nothing anyway if there was something at least.

I love this game.  I think it's under appreciated due to its similarity with talisman and relic.  Personally I don't like the warhammer universe at all, so relic is out despite the interesting character counter sheets.  Then between this and talisman the art is a whole lot more immersive on this.  Even if it is derivative of a videogame, this is the only videogame crossover I've seen which is more fun to play than the videogame.  Great job, guys!

Some interesting ideas here however it does seem to suffer from 'I am the witcher, I will win' syndrome slightly as the witcher character has 3 hero dice to everyone else 1. This means he is better at the fights therefore he suffers less negative consequences therefore he is ahead of the other players. 

It also seems you must plough through your individual discovery deck as quickly as possible and get as many as you can into play. The fell fate cards are a nice idea but they are very different levels some incredibly punishing and others fairly innocuous.

Wasn't sure what to make of the initial reviews of this game - I wanted an "Adventure" game to immerse me in the Witcher world. Alot of reviews said this was a simple race that lacked in theme.

Well I watched as many Play session videos that I could find on YouTube and delved in - the overall theme was still drawing me in and the euro-esque mechanics did not put me off.

Got the Android version whilst waiting on my physical copy to arrive, and I have loved it.
There is tonnes of theme here, from the great art to all the side/world info across the cards.
The different, and widely varied play styles of the 4 characters are very interesting and encourage repeat plays.
The mechanics are fairly light and it is in essence a race game, but the obstacles and threats placed in your path provide interest and thought on how to mitigate & avoid them.
A very enjoyable, easily played romp around the Witcher.


There are ways it could be improved and it certainly feels like it is very open to tweaking, the biggest improvement I would like to see would be a way to tie the end-game goal better to the theme/lore of the title, rather than just a pure VP total.

Would recommend it nonetheless and hope it receives the support it deserves!

RATING: 5
Knowing that Ignacy Trzewiczek was at the helm of its design, I had high expectations for this game. Unfortunately it really doesn't live up to them. Playing The Witcher, unlike its name implies, doesn't make you feel like A hero living an adventure. Instead, the whole affair comes down to a slow and tedious race around a ridiculously small map for little pieces of unimportant information. The repetitive encounters and useless side quests don't achieve to elevate an overall clunky and boring experience, where every action feels like it's meant to drag the game longer. Never does the player feel any tension, or threat, rather the petty urgency of reaching a certain point on the map within a limited number of turns. The bland flavor text doesn't succeed at spicing the theme, which comes across as very formulaic. The art and the component quality are impeccable though, which makes the disappointment even more bitter.

El juego es lento pero no se si se debe a que es largo o solo no tiene buen ritmo.

Aun así yo jugaría mas veces ^^

I'm a Witcher fan.  I've read and enjoyed the books that have been translated so far and loved both video games.  I found the digital version of this board game to be a painfully pared down, boring, pick-up-and-deliver exercise that couldn't be salvaged by any flavor lore known to humankind.  For all of the defensiveness the negative reviews have garnered by a very vocal group of inexperienced gamers here on the geek, I'm pretty sure no one will be talking about this game in 12 months.  If you're curious or just want some Witcher art on your shelf, catch it on Tanga when it inevitably ends up there.

I am completely devastated what have they done to this game. Such big hopes for nothing! I was waiting for an adventure, I received Arkham Horror in fantasy theme. Arkham Horror is a good game, Witcher is terrible. I understand FFG is magnetizing publisher and Ignacy Trzewiczek is still a great designer but I think the influence of FFG to make Witcher look like Arkham Horror was great. Not a thrilling game, but i don't blame Mr Trzewiczek, I blame FFG!

RATING: 4.5
Pros:
+ Nice quality and graphics.
+ Flavor text makes sense and is at times cynical, what's good.
+ Differences between characters are maybe not significant in how does the game plays, but change your focus quite a bit and are thematic - that's nice.
+ I usually don't care 'bout miniatures, but I must admit they create some atmosphere. Not too much, though rough tokens would be much worse.
+ The spells, witcher's signs etc. Are also very thematic.
Cons
- The game takes you 10-20 years back in the design of adventure games. You can find yourself in such situation when you get hurt and take half of your actions in the next turn. Why? Just because? What can you do about it? Nothing! What does it bring to the game - mechanically (cause, to be honest it is thematic, but as I suppose this is nowhere to be a simulation, right?)? Completely nothing, beyond making the game longer.
- The you_get_hurt-you_can't_do_the_action mechanic is... Terrible. It makes the game unnecessarily long.
- The development action. Ok - again, it is thematic, but it really takes too long to develop your character into the level when he doesn't get wounded each time he fights. And how many action do you have to use, to ,,respawn" some of these developments? Too much - again, it makes the game longer. For no reason at all.
- No cohesion between missions or whatever you're doing on the board. No main reason you're doing all what you're doing. No plot. You just move from here to there. OK - first book in the series is just a few stories mixed together, but they still feel cohesive.
- Random element - come on. We're in 2014. There have been designed a lot of games that take care of managing the random elements (dice/cards) so much better than here, without bringing too much complication.
- The lens mechanic is... sooooo booooring. 

Pity. I had high expectations for this to be light-hearted gatewawy game in Witcher's world. With fun, bright mechanic.

Despite the twelve different decks and the bad two-part rulebook (not surprisingly, given the designer and the publisher), this is a relatively simple adventure game. Being a fan of the books, I got caught by the theme, but one really needs to read the flavor text to feel it. In order to complete quests, you just move around collecting "leads" that you turn into "proof" at different exchange rates, depending on their type and your character. This can get quite repetitive, as the game is not short. But I actually prefer this abstractness to the excessive fiddliness of other games in the genre.

The only thing I really dislike is the awful randomness of the cards, with their wildly varying effects. With the foul fate deck, for example, you can suffer nothing or lose victory points - even when the card is drawn by another player! The investigation decks, though, may be the most annoying, as they are supposed to help the players (drawing from them is a voluntary action) but include harmful cards. The tiny font and icons in development cards and monster tokens are a different annoyance.

However, despite the flaws, I'm still enjoying to explore the game after a few plays. I don't know how long that feeling will last, but each character is quite different and this definitely helps in the replayability. The board art and the miniatures are very nice.

Some interesting mechanics and, once you get started, plays faster than I had anticipated. Very little character interaction, which wont bother everyone. What bugs me, is think, is the lack of flavour in the structure of the game, especially given the subject matter. All the flavour comes from the cards and the abilities of the characters - performing quests all comes down to collecting tokens, and there is no grand scheme, none of the politics from the books.

I bought this game on clearance after playing the app and identifying pretty quickly that a) I enjoy the game and b) I'm most likely to enjoy the app more than a physical game.  I just couldn't pass up having minis for Geralt, Triss, Dandelion, and Zoltan (well, Geralt and Triss at least).  I do enjoy the physical game, although it can get a bit long and it feels like Geralt is a bt easier to win with than the other characters. I originally thought it was an odd game style for the license, but it works, especially if you are already familiar with the lore.  If you aren't, then the quests probably aren't very meaningful and there isn't much there to give you an idea of who the characters are and what sort of relationships they have with each other.  If you are familiar with the lore, though, it is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon, even if it is just collecting bits from different parts of the map to deliver them to another part of the map.

Basically it's a game where you manipulate custom 6 sided dice results using abilities you pick up in the first part of the game, then circle the board looking for harder target numbers that you combo into. It feels too long and clunky for what it is- I'd rather play King of Tokyo.

I really, really wanted to like this game.

It's simple, but offers few strategies. I really like how every character is different  and how all characters are balanced.

What kills this game for me is:
1. Gameplay length
2. Downtime

It may be house ruled, but I think that I prefer Eldritch Horror or even Talisman.

Update: 4->5
Game still have it's cons, and previous oppinion is valid, but playing it with right group of people make it much more enyojable and better. Still not the greatest game, but with some people it is fun.

Watched some of the videos. Was hoping more "Robinson" would be brought into the fold here, instead we have the same ole' go here, explore or fight, roll dice, then go here R&R etc type D&D simple boardgame template, don't see much narrative and story elements coming into play here, nor the tough decisions of Robby. As someone in a thread said looks like more Runebound than Descent which for me means likely too simplistic to get the full RPG flavour out of it, much like Castle Ravenloft and the Pathfinder Card game before it, which are passes for me

Hopefully with the Boardgame version there will be more "to it" (and less downtime) than what videos show, but if so it will likely come out in typical FFG multi-expansion style where you need to spend $150+ to try and get the full game. Likely off my wantlist until played and more info comes out.

I am biased. I am a huge Witcher fan. 

With that said, this game is a unique and fun experience but because of the lack of interaction between players, it can feel a lot like a Ticket to Ride or a 7 Wonders where you're playing a game with friends but not necessarily engaging with them.

Great flavor text on the cards. Follows the game lore pretty well.

Apparently some people don't like it because they've never played the video games (their loss) or they just play it without reading the lore section or the flavor text on cards to spice up the game.

Admittedly the game can be a bit long and the dice rolls early on can feel really bad. Easy to play Geralt because he's straight forward but other characters take a bit of finesse. If you're a fan of the witcher you will probably enjoy it but otherwise you can pass on it.

[i]Disclaimer: I was a beta tester of the physical version.[/i]

Components are top notch. The custom dice in particular are gorgeous, and the whole production values in general are great. The game is very accessible. Rules seem a wee bit convoluted when read out loud, but are very easy to grasp if taught with examples. It's reasonably short too. First couple games may drag, but after a couple plays it can be routinely finished in around 25 minutes per player. Also, each character has its own, distinctive playing style, which increases replayability.

It was designed to appeal to the masses, and it shows. Gameplay itself is rather abstract, and veteran board gamers tend to get the impression of the game is not bad, yet a wee bit shallow. Some characters are also much harder to play than others, leading to balance complains among newbies.

The game also seems more a racing game than an adventure game. The winner will be the player who manages to optimize his routes best. It also has a bit of "push your luck" when it comes to drawing cards and battling. Interaction is also limited and mostly indirect.

As a two player game, it can be finished in around 45 minutes, which is a very short playing time for a game of this kind and weight. With three or four, while streamlined, it's not all that engaging. In any case, it's a good introductory game for fans of The Witcher saga.

12-01-2014 - Demoed this one at BGG.CON and immediately loved it!  We tried to check it out but weren't able to until 1 hour before the library closed and we had a great time before having to cut the game short.  I initially rated it a 10, seeing it as a quicker game that scratched in the same place Arkham and Eldritch do.  I saw it at my FLGS and bought it without a thought.  Then we played a full game at a game night...  It kind of fell flat.  Being over the anticipation and hype now, the game just isn't that interesting after all.  Yes, there are many similarities to Arkham, but there aren't many dramatic moments when everything comes down to a dice roll or encounter.  There's SOME of that, especially when someone completes a quest - which is my favorite part of the game because it's the only real time something HAPPENS.  Otherwise it's just moving on a board collecting clues (which are easy to get, no dice rolls, no encounters, you just get one at (nearly) every location) until you have enough to complete a quest.  It's ... just boring.  :(  I really wanted to love this game, and thought I did, but dangit.  Maybe there'll be an expansion to make it more interesting.  My wife still likes it so I'm sure we'll get plays in.  And that's ok, I don't hate it, it's just not the star I thought it was.  Anyway, down to 7.5 and we'll see.

The game design is overall incoherent and appears like a mishmash of mechanisms and ideas borrowed from [b]Elder Sign[/b], [b]Talisman[/b] and [b]Arkham Horror[/b].

The game wants to be a thematic game, yet it has so many abstract mechanisms:

Why am I freely allowed to distribute wounds and negative "foul fate" effects to my set of possible actions in a way it suits my current situation best (like purposely taking a wound to a leg, because I know that I don't want to travel next round) ?

Why am I collecting "clue" tokens (available in 3 different colours) in such a boring way, without any kind of test or risk of failing to do so, but by just moving my character to a certain space of that colour ?

Why is this game actually called an "adventure" when it is actually a race ?

Why is it competitive but also has small cooperative elements ?

Why is there no interesting player interaction at all ?

I really wanted to like this game and was looking forward to its release, but playing it actually feels really weird, like an overambitious mix of different and unfinished ideas.

Having said that, the components are really great and the game pays tribute to the source material very well in form of nice flavour texts and illustrations. It's also great that each character plays and feels different with his/her own decks of cards, dice and 1 unique ability.

Fans of [b]Talisman[/b] or light thematic games in general could actually enjoy this game -- all others should definitely test it first before they consider buying it.

On a personal note, I am disappointed with this game, as designer [b]Ignacy Trzewiczek[/b] normally does know how to implement theme into games the right way, plus the [b]Witcher[/b] license offers so much potential for making a way more interesting and just better game.

A good or even great game that mixes thematic settings and events with a interesting system. That being said while the system typically would reward a good strategy it still has a lot of random elements, which I can understand might be infuriating for some people.

The main objective of the game, to gather resources is not in itself that interesting, but is a simple enough mechanic. The best part of this game is that each character has a entierly different thematic playstyle suitable for that particular characters. The witcher is a monster hunter in the books so he'd rather destroy monsters in order to gain them, while the other players have different strengths and must focus on different tasks.

In order to be a "perfect game" it would require two things. 

1.Some way for a player to have a chance to catch up. Being an open-points game, it will often be painfully obvious if some person is falling behind. And 

2.More interaction. Dandelion has some player-interaction mechanics, and can trade with each other, but this is rarely used because of resource management. Usually you do not need/have anything to be traded. 

Adding some sort of expansion in the future that allowed for a more trade based economy of leads and gold would be high on my must-have list.

I heard many negative comments about this during BGG.CON, but I found the demo (taught by the lovely Ming) to be interesting.

It felt a little Middle-Earth Quest ish to me (which is a compliment), though not as deep and obviously without a Sauron equivalent. We had to pack up before I got a good feel of how the game develops as you move along.

The "bad" effects you could take in order to move faster, etc., didn't feel like they were all that bad. 
But again, I didn't get to the mid-game, so perhaps there is a payoff there in game terms.

I liked it enough to play it, though I don't think I'll buy it right away.

RATING: 7
Solid as a rock. Great medium-weight fantasy adventure; has totally replaced Talisman and Warcraft in my book.
Amazing components quality (FFG style), at least 2 great mechanics (wounds reduce your actions; dice combat against 2 different values with rewards/penalties for both), a simple yet deep enough quest engine with lot of chrome, and very well-themed characters. Just, use those Investigation cards: they're here for a reason, as they're a main story driving force.

Cons? The VP count is a bit dry, and the race for the 3rd quest is not so epic. But who cares, this is a game, it has to end somehow; and this way the playing time is just right (45-60' in 2). Wanna some epic? Play Descent. 

For it's segment, it's Brilliant. A keeper.

Very ho-hum racing game with the usual Fantasy Flight flair. Kind of falls into the same vein as Talisman and Runebound, but I felt the racing aspect much more here, and I didn't care for it. The fact that I think the Witcher is a horrible IP didn't have anything to do with me liking nor disliking this game though. I just expected an adventure game, and this ended up being a weird mish-mash of mechanisms that don't belong together.

RATING: 8.7
I'll probably eventually get the all the other Horror games because I do love adventuring and my wife does not. It is hard to play The Witcher by myself.

I keep it around because I love deck builders, and that why the Witcher beats other adventure games for me. For example, Arkham has a lot of characters, but they all kind of feel like I'm playing the same person. In the Witcher, each character plays radically different, they feel different, they feel like their own character. Furthermore, each game plays differently due to the deck building aspect of the game. This is why I chose to keep it on my shelf over other adventure games. 

For now. As I said, I get a craving sometimes and I cannot play the Witcher by myself. The other negative for me is that the events feel loosely connected, where as in Arkham it feels like more of a story is happening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.8
Despite its ample chrome, this plays like a spiritual successor to Talisman, with your fate largely determined by die rolling to meet random requirements on quest cards. This could be fine, but the game lacks a lot of the charm and chaos of Talisman. Instead, what we get is a grim and rather flavorless setting (I've tried the videogames, but it still left me cold) that serves as a backdrop for a game that offers too little variety to be honestly called an "Adventure" game.

A game that is MUCH more interesting that I thought it would be. I tried it on Steam first, but it didn't really "click" with me. But my buddy is a huge Witcher 3 video game fan, so I got this game for him. When we sat down to play it, it really clicked. It is definitely like a Talisman-style of game (move and resolved cards), but with MUCH more interesting decisions to make. I expect we will pull it out fairly often (plays slightly faster than Talisman).

This feels like someone took a look at the proposition sheet and said, "yeah, let's publish that!" without letting the designer actually finish the game. Boring, repetitive and falls below what I would expect of Ignacy.

Move to a location and draw a monster card. The game gets unbalanced right at the end and allows you to score a ridiculous amount of points on your last turn, kind of rendering everything that happened over the course of the game meaningless.

Lots of dice rolling and very few meaningful decisions. This game beats you up (the Delayed mechanic is one of my least favorite things I've ever encountered) and your characters never really seem to gain power in spite of being based on an RPG franchise.

This is far from the worst game I've ever played, but that doesn't make it anywhere close to the top either.

This game had so much potential, but the end result was something that feels like it was a bit rushed. The characters they chose to include make no sense for a competitive format and Geralt seems to always be at a huge advantage over the other chracters. I think they should have gone with individuals from different Witcher schools and just focused on everyone's goal being to become the best monster slayer.

Gra ok, aczkolwiek bez rewelacji. Fajne zróżnicowanie postaci, które wyglądają na dość zbalansowane. Sporo chodzenia i zbierania tropów, które trochę nijak się mają do Wiedźmińskiego klimatu (a większa część gry się na tym opiera), do tego koniec gry po wykonaniu 3 zadań głównych wydaje się trochę sztuczny, bez większych emocji imho (większe już towarzyszą końcówce Wsiąść do pociągu :)). Na plus wykonanie i w sumie mimo wszystko tematyka w jaką okraszona została gra. Ma też bardzo proste zasady, które bez problemów wyjaśnić można osobom, które z planszówkami nie mają wielkiej styczności. Obawiam się, że na dłuższą metę może trochę nudzić, ale to jeszcze zweryfikują kolejne gry.

РПГ среднего уровня, т. е. на уровне третьего Рунебоунда. Ну может боевка послабее. Зато меньший даунтайм. Бои с монстрами проходят очень быстро. Из слабых мест пожалуй сложные имена и термины, для людей не знакомых с миром Ведьмака, отсутствие весомых плюшек в результате боев. Есть система подтягивания отстающих - квесты поддержки - но она работает только при составе 3-4 игрока. Нет системы характеристик, каковая должна быть в классической рпг. Зато сам игровой процесс не такой однородный и скудный на события как во втором Рунебоунде. Игра построена на выполнении квестов и заданий, так что бесцельного хождения по полю не будет.

It was decent.  A brilliant idea, to combine deck-building with adventure gameplay, but in the end, I'd rather just play Arkham if I'm going for an adventure game.

I also did not like how you felt like it should be a coop game, but you were really in competition with others instead of helping them.

This is the kind of game where you spend a few turns to build up to something and then you draw a card that wipes everything out and takes you back to square one.  It is extremely frustrating.  Also, the characters are not well-balanced, so if you're unlucky, you'll have to play a character that doesn't have a good chance of winning.  This was a real disappointment.

Extremely dull game. Very random, very little strategy. This is an uninspired pick-up and deliver game, with no innovations and a pasted-on theme. Nothing about it is horrendously broken, but a cold numbness sets in after round 2, when you realize you've literally just seen everything this game has to offer...and it wasn't much. Everyone I played with - including two hardcore Witcher fans - wanted it to end as soon as possible.

I love Ignacy. I love Fantasy Flight. But this is nothing more than them slapping together a licensed game and cashing their paychecks.

Rating probably skewed 'cuz of my interest in the games and books, but kudos to Fantasy Flight and the designer for cramming so much source material into this game.

The game itself is a great "experience" adventure- kind of like the bastard child of Tales of Arabian Nights and Mage Knight, and also Talisman is its crazy uncle.  It's an excellent amalgamation, taking cues from its peers and ends up striking a great balance between "I want to turn my brain off" and "I want to calculate every possible action and consequence."

Played it three times in a row the first time I bought it. The theming is fantastic and you really feel like one of the characters. The component quality is fantastic.
The game, however, takes a little to long to play, so although it holds my interest, it often doesn't hold the interest of the people I am playing it with. So we usually shorten the play time by 1/3rd(playing with one less quest).

RATING: 4.5
This revolves around moving to gather leads, and drawing cards to spend those leads. Felt like for each character, there were one or two ways only to reach for the win. Player interaction is almost non existent. Game is based more on luck of the draw or dice rolling with a slight manipulation of the dice. Bad effects of the cards do not really hurt your character, unless you have a stroke of bad luck which can really take you back.

The game components and art are very good as well as the flavour text of the cards, and having played both the beta and the actual game I feel that a good game is somewhere in there, but found the current form of it a bit boring and repetitive. 

It is an easy light game that will certainly be a hit for many gamers, but it is not my cup of tea.

I LOVE this game. And I absolutely do not understand other people complaints, that it is not thematic, that the game plays you etc. It has very similar mechanic to Eldritch Horror, which everyone praises yet still there is no love for it. Personally, I think negative reviews are the result of failed expectations. But it is not the game's fault. Game is brilliant - you do feel differently playing different characters. You do understand the reasoning behind the goals of every quest. And finally, it is a race game - that makes it a puzzle game - how to accomplish what I need as fast as possible. I had a lot of fun with a game and I do WISH so much that there will be an expansion eventually.

RATING: 4
Repetitive. Becomes boring very quickly. Solitaire. With 4 players you wait for your turn too long, thus it's even more boring. Not that difficult to play, but the rules are lacking - Portal trademark. Deeper than Talisman, but also more fiddly. Deeper and wiser, but less fun.

Not a winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I wanted to love this game, but I really can't. It was supposed to be pretty entry-level, like Talisman, but with more modern mechanics. And it serves that purpose.. in a way. It's also an adventure, you collect items, events and develop skills. It's less random. However it suffers the same problems - terrible downtimes, solo-play with people (the game is much more fun as a single-player tablet application than it as a board game to me), even less interaction than Talisman has (it happens, but feels forced). The character development and balance is actually pretty great and the only reason I rarely play it. 

However the game itself can be summed up as collecting tokens in various places. Talisman is flawed, but gives you this sense of adventure with one common goal (who gets first to the Crown). The Witcher is flawed and only gives you fun characters with smart mechanics, then puts you in the world and design that you don't care about. This is even more sad, because I'm a huge fan of Sapkowski's Witcher series and I enjoy the computer games as well. 

I'm giving it a 5 because it's by no means terrible and has potential (maybe an expansion can fix those issues? I've seen some pretty good fan-made ideas).. but honestly if we're looking for that kind of fantasy adventure, we'd pick Talisman, as it has potential to be at lest more fun and surprising with its randomness. We won't choose it when we have other titles, but it's definitely enjoyable and well done enough to play with people if you have no better choice in your group for an adventure game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a great piece of game design, featuring four different heroes who all approach the same objectives (scoring VP's) in completely different ways. It's also unique in that while it is a competitive game, it has the same quick escalation of danger that you often see in co-op games. This makes the first few times you play tense and exciting...Until you figure out the solution to the puzzle, which really doesn't change from game to game.

As interesting as the asymmetry between the heroes is, the side effect is that the heroes are also on rails. They are so specialized in their win condition that they can't really do anything else. So the game plays itself, and you will have maybe three or four sessions until you've seen everything there is to see.

RATING: 5.3
I played this at BGG Con with some friends, I admit I wasn't that interested but my friends both were. It felt really similar to Eldritch Horror (EH) except a different theme, oddly enough almost like a Euro version of EH to me. In the game you travel around trying to complete your objectives, collect resources, battle foes, and setup your next move. But unlike more traditional euros the game does a good job of keeping the Ameri-Thrash feel the whole time. Which I must say is a tip to the designer, that is not easy to pull off.

The one thing I did like about Witcher over EH was Witcher is more deterministic in what adventures you go on and what evils you battle. You do get more choices. But otherwise its about same level of randomness and your strategy in Witcher is trying to complete objectives you get at the beginning of the game.

I liked EH better but both are just ok to me. I tend to prefer more Euro or heavier strategy based games.

I was really interested in this game going to Gen Con. I was hoping it would be available for purchase, but it was only there for demoing. I managed to snag a seat at 10am on the second day (having learned to hurry up on the first day) and played as Triss Merigold, the mage. We only played up to one quest, but the game felt longer than it should and the decisions were not terribly interesting: should I go here or there and where do I need to get for my quest? I'm both a little bummed that I didn't like it (I would have loved a nice adventure game in a fully fleshed out world), but also happy since there are so many other games I'm interested in buying and owning.

I'd play this game again, but I don't think I'll be purchasing unless I see fantastic reviews after it's released.

RATING: N/A
Fantasy adventure board game based on the Witcher novels. The characters are from the series each with their own special decks of abilities and companions. As we face physical and magical encounters, we are trying to develop and verify leads towards solving our objectives. It seems to do all the stuff you would expect in a fantasy adventure game but doesn't resonate with me. Perhaps I need to read a couple of the novels and try this one again.

Based on play of the Beta. Too repetetive, little narrative, little to no alternative paths to victory. Quests and game ending condition are imbalanced. Apart from that it is a fun experience in the first 5-6 games. Gateway light game, just not my cup of tea. Would have prefered a Geralt centered co-op adventure RPG/Descent style Board game with monster miniatures on a quest map story and consequences in a campaign instead..

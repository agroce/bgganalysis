Because your actions are more or less decided for you, the game doesn't offer too many meaningful decision to you. So what's the point of playing?

Neat game.  Reminds me of [b]Black Gold[/b] in some ways.  It's got some cube-pushing and worker-placement, but the action selection is new and interesting.  Some good new ideas here.

RATING: 7.1
Luck, luck, luck.  If you don't like a lot of luck in a game then this is not the game for you.  The tile draws are key in the game, but there are enough decisions that have to be made to keep things interesting - plus it's a pretty quick play (it almost feels like filler, even though it takes 60-90 minutes) - so the luck factor is somewhat mitigated by that.

I have to say that I enjoyed the game.  It was fun, without being "great", but then I like relatively short games where luck is a factor.

The tile draw, although random, does usually leave you with interesting choices once you have the tiles - do you use a tile to try to mine a commodity, to get an ability or to seed more resources on the board where you can get them before others do?  The need for two of a type before doing anything but seeding makes for some tough choices about planning for the next turn.

The luck factor can lead to huge swings though.  There are going to be turns where you have a plan but just don't draw the tiles you need to execute it and, if you're even less lucky, someone else mines out your commodities before you get the chance to next turn.  In our first play, I fell far behind as I didn't mine anything on the first three turns due to a poor tile draw to do the diamond mining that I planned.  I think the score was 14,000 - 9,000 - 4,000 - 0.  But I got lucky in that no-one else was able to mine the diamonds I wanted and after being forced to do things like put out extra workers and send someone to the stock market where I could get a big bonus on diamonds, on my fourth AND fifth turn I got lucky and I was able to mine three diamonds each time and get 30,000 total (which beat the scores of two other players for the whole game).  I won by a mile because my bad luck at the beginning at least set me up for those big turns while my friends had their bad turns later in the game, which was much more damaging.   But it doesn't always balance out that way - one player had several turns where she couldn't move and was the only time she had the opportunity to put someone in one of the stock exchanges, she had something she felt more important to do with the tiles.  Make no mistake - being able to manipulate those stock prices when you sell is huge...

There were some aspects of this game that showed immense promise; for instance, the preprogramming mechanic was interesting and rewarding. And the economic market, with the spatial element, provided an almost brain-burning puzzle as players attempted to optimize their turn.

But overall, those interesting decisions were mitigated by the high amount of randomness and ultimately created a sour experience. When I won this game, I didn't feel like I played the best. And when I lost the game, I felt I got unlucky.

On the first glance, it is a run-of-the-mill light economic resource management game.

Interesting mechanics:  random token pulling out of a bag. You then must place the tokens and that will decide what you do during the game. It makes you plan ahead.
Similar to other games: While I have played games that feel similar none come to mind. 
General thoughts: Only played the prototype. Art is not great but this could be a fun game when finished. You are trying to collect resources and sell them on the stock market. The turn planning is what makes this one interesting.

In Siberia players are trying to harvest cubes from the board while simultaneously having pawns present in the market that increase the sale price of said cubes. The entire game is governed by disc draws from a cloth satchel. Each player draws 6 each turn, and places them on the sub-board in front of them which shows the various resource types, and then various actions that workers can do such as enter the board, move around Siberia, or work in the market (increasing cube values basically). The discs are mostly two colours, so you have to choose where to place them on your board, and once two are present in a given column you are allowed (though not compelled) to take that action.

The tension in the game mostly comes from the races that are created by the relatively scarce on-board resources. The ideal set-up is to have several guys out there all standing on the same resource that you have already increased the value on as a single harvest action can net multiple cubes if you have access to them, but having access to many cubes takes many people (as cubes may'nt be duplicates in a given region) and many people and many moves takes a lot of time. That's probably my biggest complaint about the game, doing everything feels glacial even when the game is moving along at a decent pace. There is some intrigue because of cube competition, but on the other hand, I don't think there's anything here that would make me play this over the large number of train games that use that as their central gameplay hook.

In short, a serviceable enough title, but there is nothing here that makes me want to play it again, and nothing really unique that would make me recommend it either.

Siberia was not a game I was interested much in apart from the subject (as my partner has travelled the region). But when crowds get thick as molasses, you grab what you can at Spiel, so I sat down, and gave the game a whirl.

I regret to say that I found the game itself nearly devoid of interest. This is at best light family material which will not last more than a few attempts at best at my table. The game is played rather tactically because action chips are drawn at random from a bag, and then ordered on a personal tableau; mitigating this randomness is the ability to put a ‘permanent’ action chip in place by taking its associated action (first obtained through a random draw, of course). Doing so will protect you from the capriciousness of the draw bag, but will put you behind in the money race. This is, as far as I could tell and apart from the choice what resources to use to replenish areas to indicate that new mines have been opened, the only strategic choice you make. As I said: light family material.

I should point out that the artwork is nice and playable; and that the gameplay, simple as it is, is not in any way ‘bad’ in the sense that the author did a shoddy job of it. On the contrary, it meshes together rather well. It just doesn't press any of my buttons, unfortunately.

4 oldalas szabály, 1 órás játékidő, mindkettő nagy-nagy pozitívum nálam. Ráadásul nagyon szeretem az olyan taktikai játékokat, amikben valami leszűkített készletből kell optimalizálni a cselekedeteidet.
Minden körben húzunk 6 akciókorongot és ezek elosztása határozza, meg, hogy az adott körben mit tudunk csinálni. Embereket toborozni, mozgatni, bányászni, tőzsdére embert küldeni stb. Ha valami nem jön ki jól az egyik körben, akkor átviheted az akciódat a következő körre. Nagyon szellemes mechanizmus, kicsit hasonlít a La Islára (bár ez volt előbb). Van is agyalni való, de nem fulladsz bele a lehetőségekbe. 
Kicsit ugyanakkor volt, hogy érdeklődésemet vesztettem menet közben, mintha talán néha túl korlátos is lenne.
Összességében nem rossz játék, de ilyen stílusban talán jobb a la isla.

A very nice, light strategy game with a fair amount of luck. The rules are easy, but you are always doing and planning something, which makes the game interesting.

There's much, but easy and streamlined stuff put into this one. Overall a clever game which I might buy someday.

I havn't played it as a 2-player game, but I'm sure it should be played with atleast 3 ppl and will be best with 4.

A simple cube collecting game with the available actions drawn at random from a bag. You want to get workers into Siberia and the markets early, but this is entirely at the whim of luck. The game can end very quickly so there's often no time to recover from a bad start.

RATING: 6
Has a drawing workers from the bag and place on spots on your personal player board like Orleans, but unlike Orleans the bag is communal and there is no manipulating what is in the bag (bag building aka deck building).

The game isn't that heavy/long so while the bag drawing mechanic is limited, it's still fun and the rest of the game is good enough to back it up.

Unfortunately for this game, Orleans is just better, so no reason to play this again.

After playing Siberia: The Card Game (q.v.), I had to see what was watered down from the board game.  It turns out that there's not too much.  There's not a lot more here to warrant the extra cost of the game.  If I had to do it again, I would have just bought the card game.

The 60 minute play time listed might be optimistic.  Each of the games I've played have clocked in well under an hour... probably averaging 40 minutes.

Because of the quick play time, I'm giving Siberia a solid 8 rating.

RATING: 6
The game is in the random draw of six action counters mostly featuring two options each round and allocating them to one of these options. Whenever an option has allocated two counters, it can be used in the resolution part of a game turn. Among these options are recruitments of workers, brokers or investors, moving your workers or most important extracting and selling resources before other players snatch them away. 

A player might get screwed if he doesn't draw counters to get additional workers on the board or move workers. While later in the game, it will mostly be the player's fault when he exposes himself too much to the need of drawing the right counter, early on it can be just bad luck throwing him back. Given the short playing time, I'm fine with that here.

Siberia has a good depth/length ratio and can be played with gamers and non-gamers alike. There's not much to be discovered with repeated plays but the draw mechanism is fun enough. A keeper although nothing for the top shelf.

Szibériában bányászunk majd adunk el nyersanyagokat, a legtöbb pénzt szerző játékos a nyerő. 12 féle akciónk van:

1-5. akciók: az 5 különböző nyersanyag bányászata (fekete: szén, lila: földgáz, barna: fa, narancs: arany, fehér: gyémánt)

6-10. akciók: az 5 különböző kolléga adott akciója:
 - Vlagyivosztokba település (innen indulhatnak tovább munkásaink a szép Szibériai tajga irányába)
 - lépés: munkásainkat mozgathatjuk Szibériában
 - tőzsdére menés: minden tőzsdén mások az árak, szóval figyelni kell, hogy mikor mit adunk el és melyik tőzsdén van éppen kolléga
 - befektetés: a balek, aki befektet a cégünkbe, ez történik úgy, hogy egy-egy akcióba besegít később, kisebb erőfeszítésünkbe kerül bányászni, mozogni a térképen, stb, attól függően hová használjuk fel
 - a joker-figura menedzser: ami mindent tud (egy "igazi" menedzserhez híven, ismerjük az ilyet)

11. akció: egy nyersanyag lehelyezése valamelyik körzetre (csak olyat, amilyen még nincs ott)

12. akció: a passz

A játék izgalmát a körök elején véletlenszerűen húzott 6 akciókorong adja, amiket okosan kell felhasználnunk, hogy a legtöbbet kihozzuk a helyzetből.

Szabályzata nem bonyolult, ami meg kicsit homályos, az garantáltan letisztul az 1-2. forduló végére.

Meglepően letisztult és átlátható játékmenet, valahol a light és a heavy euro között félúton, amiben még a zsákból húzott akciókorongok okozta szerencsefaktor sem zavaró, sőt. Felfogható egy cég szűkös erőforrásainak...

Sokkal több van benne, mint elsőre gondoltam volna. Egyértelműen helye van a gyűjteményben. Nem is értem, miért nem kapott nagyobb figyelmet korábban.

分數不高的遊戲 
不過我覺得還可以
遊戲主要也是快速構築自己的得分引擎
不過大家行動都是抽共同的袋中標記難免運氣了點
要靠快速挖空3種資源來結束遊戲其實蠻難的
要贏應該還是快速布建工人一次多挖些資源才會贏
規則:
*資源丟袋中抽放到圖板地圖的每個區域各兩顆不同的，剩下資源分類放上方，股票交換板塊放到對應位置，起始玩家決定哪面向上，耗盡圓片放在對應位置，投資板塊洗勻蓋著放一旁，抽四個開著放圖版左上，行動版塊丟到袋中洗勻
*年輕起始，每個玩家選一個顏色拿圖版跟六個工人，一個工人放到主圖版右下起始點，一個放在法蘭克福股票交易板塊上
*遊戲進行多輪，每輪兩個階段，直到圖板8個區域資源被拿光，或是資源區的3個空了就結束
1.抽放版塊  從起始玩家開始輪流抽六個行動版塊，然後一起放到自己的圖板上，版塊可以放在圖案上對應的圖案下方(有兩種的就二選一)，或是放在整個圖版下方當作研究設施(沒位置放一定要放下面)
2.行動  玩家輪流行動直到所有人跳過，圖板下方如果有板塊擇一定要先使用掉，每個行動要兩格都蓋掉才能選，可使用一個行動版塊加一個投資圓片來蓋，執行完行動版塊丟回袋中，投資圓片不動
>研究 移除所有下方板塊，每移除一版塊可拿板塊上標示的一個資源從上方供應區放到一個區域，每個區域不能有相同資源 (如果是管理者板塊則可拿任意資源)，行動版塊用完丟回袋中
>管理者 一個丟回袋中，一個可以移動到任意格當百搭
>工程師 可移動場上工人，最多三步，可移動多個，每次移動相鄰到區域
>銷售員 可放一個工人或移動一個工人到股票交易區
>工人 可放一個工人到圖板起始區，也可從股票交易區或圖板各區域拿
>投資者 選擇四個開著的投資板塊一個放到對應的個人圖版圓格上，然後抽一個補
>資源 從你有工人的區域拿走對應資源然後根據你有銷售員的板塊價格賣，選價格高的賣，資源移出遊戲，拿到的資源要馬上賣
*每一輪結束起始標記左傳，每使用的行動版塊留著，但如果超過10個要移除到只剩10個
*當一個區域沒資源時上面工人回手，放一個耗盡圓片到該區，之後移動通過不花移動點數，該區域也不能再放資源，第8個放上場時遊戲結束
*達成結束條件時，該輪結束遊戲結束，錢多的贏

well, got it in a math trade and good for me!
very pleasant light medium game. I played it after Orleans and now I understand that Orleans is a logical consequence of Siberia. Some similar mechanisms but now improved in the designers late game.
But still Siberia has life on its own, for a smaller length game, though decisions in lighter work, where there´s some luck involved that one must strive against with those investors.
Timing is also crucial and you must keep an eye on your opponents. 
Fun, relatively quick game. Recommended.
Although I am surprised with its poor rank, too little ratings, distribution problem? expensive game? both probably...

This has a great theme for a board game. The oligarchs are emptying Siberia of it's riches. The art is decent and the mechanic is fresh. Players draw counters from a bag and they need two counters to activate an action. Actions are used to collect resources, go to the stock exchange, move workers to the board and invest on actions to make later actions more efficient. Plays quickly and feels fresh and the theme is great. Not sure how lasts for more than a few games though.

Wants to be a serious economic game but for my gusto it's way too fluffy and shallow. I expected much more from this game ... and by the way: the components and the map look not that bad. Only the colors of the cubes are a bit confusing not to say a bit too similar in some cases. But what's missing is the ghost of real competition. Also there's a too high luck factor in my honest opinion.

Far too simplistic, and heavily luck driven than I like.  Some actions are so important throughout the game (movement) compared to other action ( such as putting or moving guys in the stock market) that getting stuck with certain tiles from random draw really hurts your game.  Idea of putting workers in your reserve to put down extra cubes maybe interesting idea on paper but again it is heavily depending on which tiles you draw and if you can take advantage of it later that turn..  I can see how he developed this game into much better orleans where individual bags mitigate the luck somewhat.

Players draw six tokens per turn from a shared bag and arrange them (with any left from the previous round) on their personal board. There are 10 possible actions, each of which requires two tokens of that type to activate (or one token and a permanent investment marker, which once acquired is never lost). Actions are used in aid of moving workers around a map, collecting and selling resources for profit/points, and improving the efficacy of that process.

It's clear that Reiner Stockhausen went on to refine the ideas here into the vastly superior Orléans and the comparison shows all of this game's weaknesses. The shared bag (one each in Orléans) makes drawing very random with no possible mitigation. This is problematic because actions are very unevenly valued, inherently -- investment is critical in the early game and all but worthless late, movement vice versa -- and situationally. Time and turn order can easily mean the difference between win and loss.

It plays relatively quickly but its interesting ideas are all undone by the uncertainty around actions. Undercooked.

The game plays fast (3 players with explanaiton 1 hour) and offers a good experiece for the time played.
The action selection mechanism is new to me and simultanious (draw chits from a bag, each offers 2 alternative actions, you need 2 chits per action you want to fulfil).
Different paths to victory need to be tested (quick closing game possible?)

Was introduced to this game as Loco!, and upgraded to Thor for the additional player/added beauty.

This is absolutely as simple as games get, and guess what? It's fun! Your choice every turn is super tense and there's just enough ability to screw over your friends a little to get some sweet sweet schadenfreude in. 

I kinda miss the chips from Loco, but at least the box quality is better (though less portable). Never bothered with the special action cards. Don't see a reason to.

A tight, cut-throat card game stemming from a simple mechanisms. One of Knizia's best (if not the best) card game for more than two players. Gives you the same feeling of "must play something, but don't really want to" as [thing=760]Battle Line[/thing] or [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing], but can be played with up to six players. And the mathematics are much better hidden than in [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing] or [thing=17025]Poison[/thing].

Basically the same game as Loco! if you neglect the action cards (which you should do, because they just needlessly complicate a simple game but add no depth, only make it very chaotic), but about a million times prettier.  This, and the ability to accommodate an additional player bring it a half a point higher rating.

At first, when I started seeing the gods lined up by color, and the offerings set out underneath them... well, my first thought wasn't all that favorable, as I thought it was a bit too much like Lost Cities with a different theme.

That lasted a moment or two until I realized the mechanism was entirely different, and I have to say I much prefer the way this one works.

A stock market filler with both the urgency to do too many things in too little time and some elements of chicken at the same time. A simple yet very effective design, quite typically Knizia (in the good way).

Thor is unbelievably elegant and is my favorite entry in the Quandary/Flinke Pinke/Wildlife Safari line. Thor is the bare essence of a stock-holding game and one of the few games on this list that I wish I had invented. While I enjoy the special power card, I tend to play Thor without and even still have yet to find its equal in terms of its mix of fun and depth in such a short play-time.

I remember when I first read the rules to Flinke Pinke, I thought, "Is that it? Man, that sounds really stupid and pointless." Well, I was wrong. There's all kinds of interesting stuff happening within this almost trivially simple package.  The reissues (Quandary and Thor) are both far superior to the original (Flinke Pinke).  Quandary is extravagantly produced, with wonderful chunky tiles that "clack" when you stack them.  Thor is a beautifully illustrated and more compact version that uses cards, like the original.  There are minor rules differences among the three versions.

Another little Knizia gem: extremely simple rules, fun and challenging game.

RATING: 6.5
Thor is the 3rd rethemed version of Flinke Plinke I've played- obviously I like the game!

The game does not change much at the base level; all tokens taken and items played are cards, with nice Germanic art of the Norse Gods/Goddesses.

I don't think that the art and the cards make it better than the Quandary version, my favorite retheme so far, but it is ceratinly better than Loco!, so I'll give it a 6.5 to start based on one solo 3-plater game at the base level.

Because there is an advanced level, this may step higher, but I wouldn't expect this to pass Quandary.

Tetszik a játék, csak az a baj, hogy nagyon hirtelen vége tud lenni anélkül, hogy bármit reagálhatnánk rá. Hiába játszottuk akció lapokkal, nem sokat tudtak hozzáadni a játékhoz, mert túl gyorsan véget ér egy kör és az akció kártya húzásával egy isten kártya húzásából kiesel.

Very light stock-market game along the vein of Titan: Arena or Colossal Arena. Players bet on Gods and try to finish with the highest or lowest card showing (depending on whether you take many of that particular god).

I feel that the start game is a bit pointless because you are just wasting cards. Ultimately someone will place another card on top of yours making your card moot. Okay filler game, but not particularly entertaining.

It's all about who is able and willing to end the game. Tension increases towards the end since the options in your hand become increasingly urgent and conflicting - you want to fix your scores and then end the game, but can't rely on being able to do both in one move. The downside is that if one or more players aren't paying attention the outcome can easily be decided by chaos. (One player suggested there should be floating numbers over each player's head showing their current score.) I would highly recommend playing 2-3 games with cumulative scores and the rule from Flinke Pinke that gives 2 points to each player with one fewer token.

I'm recording identical ratings and comments for Thor and Flinke Pinke/Quandary/Loco!/Botswana. Played with Rage cards and sets of glass gems.

Thor is a great little card game.  Super fast to teach, setup, and play. Graphics look cool and I love the narrow card size.  The box is even unique with a felt lined storage area.  If you're a Knizia fan like me, then you're going to want to get this game.

A simple stock game where you are trying to adjust the value of various color stocks.  The round ends when there all the stocks of one color are played so it ends based on when players want it to.  It usually results in the player that ends the round winning that round.  It is fun when you play a time or two but after repeated plays becomes samey and a bit boring.

Reimplemented the game Botswana.

NB:Thor differs from the other versions of the game in two respects: it accommodates up to 6 players (by adding an additional stock), and it includes a set of 14 action cards which can be used to affect play. Seems to make it more adult and gamer friendly.

Quite a clever little filler game. Like all these essentially themeless games it is a little ‘soulless’ but plays quite well nonetheless. My group has already finished about ten games so far and shows no sign of refusing it. Indeed, only now are we beginning to get our heads around how to get optimal value from the action cards.

Not a bad game, but there is no real feeling that I am making offerings to Norse gods, but a bit of fun at lunchtime. One worth considering if you’re looking for something slightly less complex than Battle Line with a comparable playing time and the capacity to take up to six players.

RATING: 6
Thor is a bit of a classic Knizia card game of playing cards to various locations in order to manipulate scoring totals and then acquiring cards from particular locations to score points. 

In Thor the theme in use is that of Norse Mythology and it is a clever, if simple enough premise. 

In classic Knizia fashion the mechanics found here are largely replicated in several other designs such as Loco and Botswana I think. For me this theme is most appealing but it is sadly out of print.

This is a tricky and very nice 2-player card game! As of yet I have no idea how it plays with more players! Make your offering to the mythological gods, take a god card! Collect as many gods as you can to create a multiplier to the last offer made to that god at game end!

For me, Reiner shines in his simpler games.  He understands how to boil down concept games into their simplest forms.  Quo Vadis? is a brilliant boiled down negotiation game, Medici a perfect elegant auction game, and  Flinke Pinke the purest stock game made.   When playing games like this it makes me marvel at how great the game is without the superfluous nonsense often attached to games.  This game is designed in the spirit of Occam's Razor.

This Thor version adds a bunch of cards I don't use, but it does add a new color to expand the game for larger groups (which is a perk).  I find it to be quite pretty.  Totally pasted on theme, but pretty.

RATING: 6
Have only played the Loco/Botswana versions.

--- Summary ---
God cards: 6 per color/god, in central area. Optionally, 14 action cards in separate pile. Offer cards: 0-5 x 6 colors/gods. 

Remove some cards from game if playing with fewer than 6. Deal out all remaining cards evenly. On your turn, play a card in front to the matching color, in a stack where you can see all numbers played. Then, take _any_ available god card. The hand ends when a God card has 6 Offers in front of it. Each God card is worth as many Favor (VP) as the last (topmost) Offer card. All players record their VP.

Optional Action cards: 
- _instead_ of taking a God card, may take an Action card. 
- _instead_ of playing an Offer card, may play an Action card. Either
... discard your Action and a previously played Action, OR
... place your Action above a God stack that doesn't already have an Action

Play one hand/player (each player leads once). 

Player with the most Favor (VP) wins!

Have played Loco!, Quandary, Flinke Pinke and Thor.  The first is a cheap & nasty production, the second is a beautiful one but in an infeasibly large box, and the third is somewhere in between and more appropriate to the game weight and length.  However, Thor is the one to have, being attractive, compact, and inclusive of the action card variant.

I finally managed to try this with the special cards that make it different from the other incarnations of the same mechanics (Botswana, Loco....).
I like it, and i like it quite a lot. You need the correct company to appreciate it because yes, it depends somehow on luck, it can stops abruptly if you oversee the fact that someone is trying to close the game early. But it's evil, it requires cunning and you want to play once again as soon as you finish a game.
Are the cards worth a new purchase of the same mechanic? Yes! they are. They change a lot but without changing the good aspects of the game. Go for it!!

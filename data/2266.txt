Today I bought the brand new Gobblet X4 for only ~$11CAD (Wwooowww!), and taught it to the 6 & 8 years old kids @ home, they could pick up the rule easily in a few minutes....and they won most of the matches too!! :)

Excellent quick family game, can be played in 2~5 min per match!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun and surprisingly deep, high "simplexity" (i.e., high complexity of play in proportion to extreme simplicity of rules) = just what you want from a coffee-table abstract game. 

Word to the owners of the Blue Orange edition: discard the wrapping paper enclosing the playing pieces--or at least throw away the tape.  I re-wrapped my pieces with the paper and the tape stuck to the board and made a messy adhesive mark that I can't seem to remove. Not what you want to happen with a nice-looking thirty dollar coffee-table game!

An abstract tic-tac-toe like game where pieces are added to the board and move on the board and larger pieces can "gobble" smaller pieces.  It seems like a decent design though I doubt it would hold up to serious play.  For a quick few rounds, it was interesting enough.

There is always enough time and always willing participants to play an x-in-a-row game.  Gobblet definitely provides the most bang for your brain buck in a simple x-in-a-row.  I wish Jr. was made as the full 4-in-a-row or I wish that Gobblet was more portable.

Simple abstract to explain: it starts out as tic-tac-toe, then adds a few new rules. And the new rules are fairly intuitive, thanks to the nice bits. It does suffer from common abstract problems: 2 player only, and no luck to give a novice hope of victory.

I have a nice boxed Gigamic version that doesn't have kiddy graphics (I didn't find kiddy-themed art appealing even when I was a kid; I wanted to be cool and grown-up) and thankfully doesn't have the mustard yellow color of other versions I've seen.  Very fun game to play, against any age group.  Note: the pieces fit just fine on a Quarto board, if you want to save space.

Components: Wooden box/board, sturdy plastic hollow cylinders. Fun to handle.

Experience: An interesting mixture of memory and spacial positioning. The 'gobbling' aspect is very clever, and leads to tense situations where I'm trying to force my opponent to lift specific pieces, to reveal my pieces. Definitely room for forking and other aggressive plays.

Another great publication from the Gigamic company. A well thought out extension of tic-tac-toe, a "4 in a row" game where pieces move around the board and swallow smaller pieces like matryoshka dolls. Seems a bit drawish/cyclic at higher levels of play. Preliminary rating is that it's very good.

This game is short, simple and portable making it a great coffee shop game. My set is all natural wood which has a great quality feel to it.
You need to get four of your own pieces in a row but you can cover other pieces and move already placed pieces. Sounds simple but it's rather clever and down right funny if your opponent accidentally wins you the game!

I wasn't expecting much from this simple easy-to-find abstract, but was pleasantly surprised by it.  In some ways it's just a very advanced form of Tic-tac-toe, but it has a few things going for it.  It has a certain charm that's helped by the sturdy wooden components, and the idea that your pieces can "gobble up" other pieces on the board, pieces fitting inside one another like small Russian matroshka dolls.  It provides some interesting opportunities to surprise one's opponent with some killer moves and plays very quickly. This one gets a thumbs-up from me.

I first was shown this game in a game store, and was not impressed.  Upon a second look, I somehow 'got it'.  It has turned into one of my favorite 2 player games.  And the large wooden pieces are very satisfying.  The box that turns into the board that came with the game was warped, so I use my Quarto board for Gobblet!  Works great.

Gobblet is an excellent take on four-in-a-row.  What is unique is that each large piece contains three smaller pieces.  You have to keep in mind what pieces you have left to play, which ones are on the board, and what pieces are underneath other pieces on the board.  Excellent strategy and memory game.  Sadly underrated as an abstract.  I guess because of the memory abstract, which can frustrate some purists.

No doubt, the game is simple and the goal is similar to that of other games.  Couple these factors with my usual aversion to abstract games, and the result of this combination should be an unsatisfactory experience.  Much to my surprise, however, I really enjoy the game.  I find it truly challenging, and enjoy the thinking involved in managing my pieces and attempting to achieve victory.  Bolstering my opinion is the short duration of a typical game:  5 - 10 minutes.  The combination gives me that "one more game" reaction each time I play.  That’s a very, very good indication that a game is fun and addicting -- and Gobblet is just that.

Strategy: keep your opponent from getting three (not just four) in a row. Typically you lose when you forget your opponent has a piece underneath yours resulting in your violating that strategy. Basically a memory game. Meh.

I've only ever played this with my son (6 yrs currently) so it's a bit hard to tell whether this game has any real interest for me or not. I'm going to guess probably not. But I'll bet that the first time he ends up managing to beat me on his own, I might change my mind just a tad.

This is an odd game, because while it is an abstract, it also has an element of memory. This makes it worse, not better, in my opinion. It looks nice, and is easy to teach, like most abstracts, but it really doesn't grab me in a way that makes me want to learn the strategies and play again and again. Nothing is particularly bad based on my limited play, but nothing too special either.

Played this one today for the first time, got in 10 games or so and it was a lot of fun. You really have to watch close on this one and pay attention the whole time.  But I liked it and my friend is leaving it here for us to check out some more.  Got 4 more games in today, and it is still a whole lot of fun, a lot tougher then I thought.  A good little filler game, I can play 6 or 8 times, most others seem good at 4 games or so

This is a fun, and fast family game.  I like the memory aspect.  I have the feeling that perfect memory and perfect games would become deterministic (ie, one player would always win), however I have not seen this happen.  

I have built mini-pyramids to fit inside my smallest black and white IceHouse pieces.  These act as the forth in Goblet, so I now have another game for my IceHouse set.

This game was given to me for christmas.  Very nice pieces, abstract game.  Unless I play a lot, I suspect the game will involve a lot of players going 'I didn't see that!  Crap, you win!'

Seems like a smart twist on the four-in-a-row theme, but I'm not really into that. Also the memory test aspect is not a plus for me. I can keep track if I really want to, but it's not fun for me.

Can be a tricky and frustrating little game!  Graduated tic tac toe, MUCH more depth, actually no comparison other than trying to get 4 in a row instead of three but with the different pieces and movement rules this is actually a GAME where as tic tac toe is not.

The wood pieces are very nice and are pleasant to move around.  I like how the pieces nest and how that creates a memory element to the game.  Still, it's hard for me to think of all the potential moves and I find myself just making random placements that are not helpful.  So the production values are wonderful, but I think it's not exactly my kind of game.

RATING: 6.5
A simple connect four style abstract strategy game where the players take turns placing pieces on the 4x4 grid (or moving pieces already on the grid) trying to get four in a row. However, there is a clever twist that really makes this game unique. The pieces are cups of different sizes so that you can play larger cups over the smaller ones, completely covering them. This means you can block your opponent from getting four in a row by taking one of the spaces in the row (as you’d expect) or by just enveloping one of her pieces with yours.

It should be noted that if you lift a piece you are required to move it so you must be cautious when moving your larger cups. It’s possible that you’ll lift one of your cups to discover a forgotten piece belonging to the opponent underneath which might give them 4 in a row. This adds a definite memory aspect to the game which is not generally to my taste, though I do enjoy it occasionally.

A OK game, not so bad.  It is good for a couple in a row.  I find most games end from one of us spacing off a simple move.  Our friend brought it over and has left it here, so it is seeing some table time, we have decided we should get it.  It is cool how it is just TTT rules, so any one can figure it out.  We are using the deluxe version in the hard box, we like that one.

RATING: 5
This is an interesting Tic-Tac-Toe style abstract.  I'm sure it's deeper than it appears, and I might enjoy it if I played it more but at my current level of play, the win is typically the result of an error or oversight.  I have a similar problem with the game Quarto and I find them both a bit dissatisfying. I should note that I have only played this on boardspace.net and not with the physical game itself.

I could easily lose an evening or two to this game. Fantastic.  Very accesible with real challenges for every level of player.  The russian doll mechanism with the simplicity of tic-tac-toe on a 4x4 board is just stunning in its simplicity but somehow gives it a unique feel.  Highly recommended for any abstract fan.

Played on the Blue Orange Games version which was beautifully packaged but I was not surprised to see a Gigamic version available.  From an aesthetic point of view I would choose the Blue Orange version every time.

Another excellent abstract strategy game from Gigamic. The game is basic 4-in-a-row game, but with a nice twist that requires memory as you can place your bigger pieces on top of smaller ones hiding them from both players. If you are not careful, you can accidentally move a wrong piece from the board and reveal your opponents piece and lose straight away.

Decent game for its own right.  A very accessible abstract strategy game for two.  The issue is the game can be very repetitive since most of the stalemates can be resolved under one condition: Someone forgets who is covering what piece.

If you can find this at a thrift store or cheap, it's worth grabbing.  I wouldn't have paid for full price for it though, despite the wonderfully crafted components.

Easy to learn but not so easy to master.  Basically, this game could be summed up as a complex version of tic-tac-toe, in which your pieces can be temporarily "gobbled" up.  Fun and casual, but could get boring rather quickly after a number of consecutive plays.  Definitely worth playing again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell:  A four-in-a-row game where pieces may be moved once placed and even cover others.

Played as: Two-player game only.

Pros: Has a simple elegance to the presentation that makes the game both attractive and easy to convince others to play. It's an easy game to explain, play, and allows for players to peel back the layers of depth from the beginning. Who doesn't love "gobbling up" other players pieces?

Cons: Though it does offer a lot more, it still is reminisant of Tic-tac-toe, in a "been there, done that" sort of way. There's a memory element to the game (remembering what's covering what) that maybe adds a bit of challenge, but certainly not fun. Perhaps it's in this sweet spot of simple / complex that encourages AP in the form of, "I can figure this out if I just stare at it long enough".

Other: The whole thing comes across as a "How can we fix Tic-tac-toe" game design. I think, they've succeeded by adding another 3rd dimension to the game but the experience remains largely familiar.

Best Use: An excellent entry level step (for or with the kids) into abstract games.

This game is owned by my oldest, who received it for Christmas '06.

Gobblet could be described as tic-tac-toe on steroids, or a souped-up Connect Four, or a combination fo tic-tac-toe and checkers, but really it's a rather fun game in it's own right.  Unlike tic-tac-toe, Gobblet uses a 4x4 grid, but the business of acquiring four in a row is harder than first glance because you can a) move the pieces around and b) use one piece to "gobble" an opposing player's piece.  The gobbling works to your detriment as well as to your advantage:  if you forgot that you'd gobbled up an opponent's piece before trying to use that same piece again, you risk exposing that original opponent's piece a second time.

It helps to teach abstract strategy to older (pre-teen) kids, and provides a quick filler in between longer games.

Oh, and the production values on the game are really nice; it's built for the long haul.

This game does seem too easy at first, making you wonder why you don't just play tic-tac-toe. However, as long as both players avoid obvious mistakes, the game enters into a new phase, where your visual memory is the skill that counts.

I have one of the wooden box editions.  The cups do not all fit inside each other.  I've done a fair amount of sanding and filing to inside of a few of the cups, and am now to a point where they can all be pulled apart with some effort.  Most are very loose, but there are some that just aren't sized right.

Four in a row variant where you can cover your opponent&#039;s placements and also move your placements on the board. More fun than the dry original because you have to remember where you covered your opponent&#039;s pieces otherwise you may lose because you revealed your opponent&#039;s winning placement. Still, an imbalanced game as player with better memory and tactics will dominate, so not really a family game. Also may suffer from manufacturing problem in that a pair of gobblets can stick together.

RATING: 6
A four in a row, where pieces can "eat" each other. Your carefully planned strategy might come apart when you (or your opponent) lifts a piece, and there is something underneath which you did not expect.
Another cool game from Gigamic, and almost as enjoyable as Pylos or Quarto. Much fun for two players.

RATING: 6.5
A good twist to the old alignment mechanic; I would generally see the "memory" element in an abstract game as a weak point and boring, but here I find it interesting as the need to remember past moves and hidden pieces is part of the skills needed to win.

It's noughts and crosses with a twist - not a bad twist but still.  The aim is to get 4 in a row, the twist is that you can gobble (cover) other pieces.  This is interesting because it introduces a memory element into the game, and gives you pieces with different defensive capabilities (the biggest pieces can't be gobbled etc). The problem is that like noughts and crosses it inherently errs towards a stalemate, and there is nothing clever here to solve that problem.  Good fun with kids who have mastered noughts and crosses though.

Pretty good abstract game with nice wood components.  I'm not really one for abstracts but I'd play this one again because it's fast.  Its a nice play on four in a row but there is memory aspect that isn't seen in these type of abstract games that makes this one unique.

Roy's game

My youngest son was really into puzzles, mind games, and games by age 3. He drove me crazy wanting to play with them over and over. I needed variety, and scoured stores for things we could play that he could understand and I wouldn't go crazy playing. This was a good one. A more complex tic tac toe.

Fun abstract feels like a combination of Tic Tac Toe and Quarto. Clever mechanism. More thoughtful than it appears at first glance. This game has a "one more time" feel to it: As soon as it's over, I want to play again. I'd like to find the Gigamic version.

I had fun with this game, though I think I've designed a strategy that can force a draw, playing as black. Often, black wins if white doesn't play perfectly.

[6 plays] I think with many more plays against equal opponents, perhaps I might rate this higher, but I haven't had a chance to be challenged by higher strategies yet. I was taught this by by niece and nephew, and had great fun playing with them. The components are very nice, and the quick to learn rules are a nice deal.

Gobblet is a really neat abtract. As abstracts go, it's light and quick - and yet, you can lose very quickly with an accompanying shock if yuo fail to pay close attention to the progress of the game. Gobblet reminds me of Connect Four, Tic-Tac-Toe, Pente, and a bunch of other games - combined with those little nesting Russian dolls (which you could actually play the game with if you had enough sets of them). Each player has three sets of four cylinders. In each set, the cyclinders nest within each other so that you must play the largest one first, the second largest next, and so on. You take turns playing these pieces on a four by four grid, trying to get four in a row. Once a piece is on the board, it can "gobble" up other, smaller pieces (you may choose to do this instead of placing a new piece on the board). You know how, when you play Tic-Tac-Toe against someone who is really dim, you can win by setting up a situation where you will win regardless of your opponent's move? Well, in Gobblet, you are trying to execute a more complex version of that - but the game isn't broken like Tic-Tac-Toe. As you play the game more, you begin to see ways of positioning defensively and of manipulating your opponent's plays which will lead you to a win. That said, it's pretty tactical for an abstract. What you need to do to win is highly dependent upon what your opponent chooses to do. This makes the game fun even for people new to it, though.

Amőba, kicsit megbolondítva. 3x4 különböző nagyságú hengert helyeznek a játékosok a 4x4-es táblára. Az érdekesség, hogy a nagyobb hengerek rárakhatók a kisebbekre. Így kell négy azonos színt kirakni. A játék emiatt egyértelműen memória játékká válik, ami nekem nem igazán tetszik.

This game reminds me of the kinds of games that came out in the 70's and 80's by Lakeside.  Even though I know that this came out this millennia, I can't help but feel that I'd seen this in my Grandfather's closet.  This is a nice, safe, classic abstract.It is very reminiscent of games that have gone before, but bumps them up to a more modern, savvy level.  If I were more into straight abstracts I probably appreciate this more.  Still, I would probably jump into any game of Gobblet that someone offered.

Those that are turned off by the memory aspect should just play where you can look under the cups, I think it makes for just as challenging a game.

This isn't bad, but if I'm going to play a quick abstract, I much prefer Quarto to this one.  It seems that this one ends far more quickly and has less strategy, as the consumption of pieces shifts the balance of power much more quickly than in Quarto.

RATING: 6
A nice connect-four type game made of nice wooden components.

The board is a 4x4 grid. Players each have 12 pieces: 3 sets of 4 nested cylinders (like those Russian dolls) which are set up with largest on top of each stack. On your turn you can:
- add a piece to any empty spot on the board
- move a piece on the board to another empty spot
- move a piece already on the board on top of another (smaller) piece, "gobbling" it up
If you touch a piece on the board, you MUST move it.
First player to get 4 in a row (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) wins!

This is a pretty cool 4-in-a-row game. Like the newer CoverUp, you have to remember what you've gobbled so you don't accidentally move a piece away and let the other guy win (like I did!)! Unlike CoverUp, you can move any of your pieces, not just the biggest. Not a bad game ... just not anything we'd play very much.

Abstract game of four-in-a-row where each player has pieces in four different sizes; larger pieces can cover (gobble) smaller ones, which will return to play if the covering piece moves.

My theory of abstract games skill-curve is that beginners' play is characterized by losses from unforced error -- he who makes the worst mistakes loses. The memory element in Gobblet seems deliberately designed to prevent players ever getting past that point, because losses will almost exclusively be because a player forgets that moving a particular piece will reveal one that will lose them the game. It is a worthless waste of time that I rate a 3 or lower.

But played with open information it's quite a brainburner. The gobbling mechanism means that only the largest of a player's pieces can safely block as any smaller piece could be gobbled up and a row of four formed. The restrictions (e.g., it is only possible to gobble with a piece from off the board is the gobbled one is part of a row of 3) open up another tactical dimension.

It packs a lot of painful depth into a 4x4 grid, but I'm fairly sure I don't like it: I find myself comparing it to other abstract games that are difficult for the wrong reasons (i.e., in this case it is clear that ply analysis is rewarded but there isn't much of a broader game of influence to go along with it), and it seems to turn into quite a grind where unforced errors are easy but forced wins (e.g. by fork) are difficult.

This game is the most fun when two players get most or all of their pieces on the board and the memory aspect really kicks in.
But I don't mind that some losses happen because one player misses the other player's win opportunity.  This game just wears down the brain enough to do that to people.  You must maintain a balance of narrow focus and broad focus.

Gobblet is a snappy coffee-table game that works well with individual party guests.  The surprise moment of gobbling one's way to victory nearly always energizes the opponent into another game.  As with other big wooden games, however, once you learn the trick, it runs out of gas.

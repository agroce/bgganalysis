A very nice assymetrical game with a western feeling like having a movie in front of you! Luck of the draw can be very critical but it's a fun game for 30' so it doesn't matter that much and it allows mutliple games.

Neat little asymmetrical card game for two players with a western theme. Sometimes the luck of the draw can really screw one player and greatly benefit the other, making the outcome of the game pretty easy to determine by the half-way point. Hoping the expansions make the game a little more interesting and do something to make the extreme tips in one player's favour a little less frequent.

I think I've been suckered by theme integration.  You can't make it through a deck in a single game, and there are cards on both sides that are cosmically huge in terms of actually winning the game.  I found it unusually satisfying to play around a lack of draws, or to try to anticipate them.  Seems much better with even slight deck knowledge.  Don't discount it, and try it from both sides.  Pleasant and sufficiently asymmetrical.

THE THEME OF THIS GAME IS SO GOOD!
While Doomtown captures the tense buildup and final quick draw of a shootout at high noon, this game captures the runaway action scene as the bandits try to escape the law after a bank robbery. The bandits are constantly on their toes having to decide exactly when to play their best cards while law dogs are fighting for every inch to keep pace and gun 'em down.

Nice enough theme, but I don't really see the point of it. Truly meaningful decisions seem to be extremely limited, and if you have a bad initial turn or two, so you have a small hand, that will last for the rest of the game, making the game truly pointless.

I traded this away for A Castle for All Seasons in the Essen 2014 math trade.

RATING: 7
Revolver is another two player asymmetric card game, with one player playing as the the bank robbers trying to high tail it to Mexico and the other as the lawmen trying to stop them. Players play cards on their side of the table trying to get the high poker chip value on their side. If at the end of the round the bandits have a higher chip count they remove a token from the Mexico card (if that card empties they win) and if the sheriffs win, they kill one of the bandits (all the bandits dead means the sheriffs win).

I'm not a Western fan generally, but I do like the theme of the game in the artwork of the game, which is well done. However, I'm still not sure what to think of the game. First play went well enough, but the second one ... was kind of flat. I think it was because I was reading off the rule book, which like Vampire Empire, isn't that great. It felt like I was missing something (maybe some rules?) have would allow the game to really become fun. I'm going to have to play a third time to see how I really feel.

8/10: Rating based on base game with expansions 1.1 through 1.5.  Turns up the number of choices that need to be made form turn to turn.  Makes the game feel more strategic and tactical.  Most of the choices often times turn out to go with the base cards, but in every game a moment or two will arise where you stray from the base game cards.

7.5/10: Vanilla Base Game still tells a great story, just less choices from turn to turn.

Play a variant of the game where all modules are included one way or another with the exception of deck building.

Deck building was eliminated in favor of putting all the deck building cards into a second deck, a "Ranch" deck, which works a lot like the official "Stagecoach" deck, but with some minor differences.  To avoid confusion with "Stagecoach" rules, a new name was given to the expansion deck.

The variant is named: "Dual Six Shooter" as player plays with 2 hands of cards with hand limit being 6 cards for each hand.

Dislike the way Dollar Coins work for expansion 1.4, so created a variant of using 2 coins to peek the top 2 cards of own deck and using 2 coins to move the top 2 cards of owned deck from the top of the deck to the bottom.

Dollars are earned by discarding cards from the "Ranch" hand.  2 cards from the "Ranch" hand for 1 Dollar Coin.  Doesn't feel right awarding a Dollar Coin for losing an attack.  When/Where in life do you get awarded money for failing and nothing for winning?

Frontier cards have been reworked as well where the cards are no longer purchased for a Dollar Coin; instead, whenever a player loses an attack, they draw a Frontier card instead of getting a Dollar Coin.  Feel as though this saves a needless step.

The vanilla base game feels a bit too light for me.  With variant the game still feels light, but right as the game feels like it offers more meaningful choices now.

Initial Impressions: This is a wonderfully thematic 2 player card game. The game doesn't take too long to play but it tells a different story every time its played. The rules are simple enough that it can use it as a gateway game.

10 Plays: Despite what the critics may think, there are some serious decisions to make with almost every card played such as deciding whether to hold cards, accepting a lost battle, deciding which path to victory to aim for, and such. The best part is that this game is light enough to not cause brain burn. I'm now anxious to try out some of the deck customization that provided with the expansions.

Nice tug of war type game with a western theme. Components are nice and the game plays very smoothly. Maybe even a bit too smoothly. One could argue that the decision are mostly so obvious that the game kind of plays itself. But maybe it's just that the complexity level is too low for me. Still I had an enjoyable time everytime I played the game and games have always been very close and tense. So a good choice for a low complexity family game perhaps.

Plays fast, develops a nice narrative feel to the games and I like the decisions you need to make. They seem easy, but have consequences further on in the game. Knowing the cards that are available and repeated plays adds to the game.

Revised score upwards after our last 5 games. Games are taking us about 20 minutes now and are tense and exciting.

This was simple and fun.  When it comes down to the very end, I can see this being a good time.  When it's a blowout for the outlaws, I think it's boring. I'm not sure a blow out can happen for the law side, which makes me doubt the replayability or skill needed in this one.

The wild west theme didn't really speak to me, and underneath that, there just isn't a ton of game here - certainly nothing on similar euros like Lost Cities, Dragonheart, BattleLine, etc. - even Clash of the Lightsabres. The theme isn't bad, but it's a bit of a paste-up, I couldn't find too much fundamental - but I only played it once. Regardless, for the love of God, can we *please* draw cards at the end of the turn? The other way is stupid.

Picked up at Essen this year along with the whole enchalada of expansions. Very thematic and the artwork looks great even if the female outlaws look like a bunch of supermodels. The rules are a little bit fiddly and obscure in places though which is a bit of a pain but worth battling through I think.

A good thematic 2 player game for 45-60 mins.

A 2-player card game that just about anyone can get into; especially those who love Westerns.  The timing and card allowance (only so many cards allowed per-location if you play the Outlaw role) can make it seem confusing at first, but what's underneath the surface is a game that, while not terribly deep to begin with, is fun and easily expandable for a very large card pool.

Based on one play so far. Very thematic card game with great art, that falls just a little short as a game.

There didn't feel like much strategy and the cards just about played themselves - would be good to give a little control back to the player and away from simply how the cards are drawn. I'm hoping this will result from the additional cards in the expansions - I want to like this.

A nice 2 player card game which pits a sinister and debauched bandit and his gang of no good scoundrels against the wits of the local sheriff across several rounds.

Each player has a different set of playing instructions to the other and it's nice to swap the next time you play if you play with the same person, a little samey if played a lot, but otherwise a fun game of take that!

RATING: 3
This is a 2 player card game with asymmetrical decks and winning conditions.  This premise alone sounds right up my alley.  The result of having played a few games was what I felt like a light filler with very little decisions to be made.  Up front, I will say I lost both games (and from each side of both factions) and maybe that's soured my opinion.  That said, my friend who did win both games also did not really enjoy the game compared to the others I have introduced him to.

It should be mentioned that there are two winning conditions for each player.  The outlaws, need to survive to the end or remove all of the cubes from the Mexican Border card.  The thing about this is that, to remove cubes you have to have the lawmen not kill anyone during their round, so there is only a subtle difference (a few card choices) in those win conditions.  Likewise the lawmen needs to kill all bandits before the end or the second in command before the last scenario.  So, again, you're only real concern is to kill try and kill outlaws.  

Players also do not go through their entire deck so there will be a luck of the draw element as all cards were not created equal.  I think this would actually be a good choice for younger gamers especially considering the theme, but for me, it's not not deep enough or have enough tough decisions to be made to be truly enjoyable .  At least, not compared to the other card games in the market.

Revolver is a light tug-of-war type game. Even though the two faction decks and the win conditions are asymmetrical on paper, in reality they are close enough (and maybe more importantly, zero-sum) to not make much of a difference.

What really makes a difference, however, is what cards you actually draw from your deck. Since you don't go through the entire deck during a single play and some cards are clearly very much better than others that can make for huge imbalances in any single play. The game is pretty short so a little variance due to luck of the draw isn't too bad, but unfortunately, the decisions to be made mostly seem rather obvious and not that interesting either, and for the first games the rules questions concerning specific cards are somewhat annoying as well, especially since they aren't answered by the printed rules.

RATING: 7
I rate this game based on it's potential. I'm hoping and expecting this potential to be reached through it's expansions.

The game looks great, theme is awesome and the mechanics play very well.

Problem is that in my opinion the player who plays the good guy (Ned McReady) almost always wins. Also you're very depending on the luck of draw.

[b]The Wild West Gunfighting Game[/b] er et spil, jeg meget gerne ville holde mere af, end jeg er kommet til efter de første par spil. Et asymmetrisk spil i det vilde vesten lyder interessant og der er bestemt også fine takter i spillet. Og det lykkes faktisk at få spillet til at føles meget forskelligt, alt efter hvilken side man spiller. Desværre føles valgene ikke særligt interessante. Der ér valg og med et indgående kendskab til spillet ville valgene nok også være mere interessante, men jeg får ikke lyst til at blive ved med at vende tilbage til det og så er det jo på baggrund af de par spiloplevelser jeg har fået, det må bedømmes. Et godt forsøg, der desværre falder lidt til jorden. Øv. Jeg har dog stadig mod på at spille det spil, som spillet er videre-udviklet på baggrund af, [b]Aliens: This Time It's War[/b], i håb om at dets tema vil gøre det så uimodståeligt, som jeg havde håbet, det ville være.

I dunno about replayability, but I had a blast when playing this the first time. There is really some immersion in theme. The decks are balanced and the decision who is winner was really decided in the very last round. Yes, it was kind of decided of luck of the draw, but this game does not target the hardcore MTG strategists.
Edit: 3 games so far and every time Colty won.

This is one of those games I really wanted to like. I like the art and theme, but if you dig a little deeper it has flaws. First, don't read the character biographies in the back of the manual. They are riddled with spelling errors and just plain insulting. The people who made this game are European, but even so, they shouldn't write stupid things about slavery. For instance, "Sir Marmaduke's parents were enslaved to a kindly farmer in Alabama ... who treated his (slaves) better than his own family." It goes on to say that when the slaves were freed they were put in concentration camps in the North ... " So on and so forth. This is all just plain ignorant and there is no need for this in the game. Most of the other character biographies are laughable. Alright, on to the game play itself. There are almost no meaningful choices you can make in this game or any strategies to play. You put down some cards, your rival puts down some cards. You may or may not get lucky with the cards you draw. I even bought an expansion, hoping it would add some value to the game play (it did not). Lastly, you can't even play this game with your kids, who may like a western theme and not care about the frail game play because it has adult pictures and material in it. Some of the cards in the expansions talk about prostitution and drug use. In the end, I would avoid this game. It fits no meaningful niche in a game collection. It is only two players, adult only, and extremely fast to play with no strategy. There are so many better two player games out there, this is an avoid at all costs.

As a big fan of the Aliens: This Time It's War game and all things western, this game is a must-buy. Can't wait to get it.

I give it a 10 for theme, ease to teach and play with others, components, and the planned expansions to keep me returning for more and to keep the game fresh.

I also own:
1.1 Ambush on Gunshot Trail
1.2 Hunt the Man Down
1.3 Vengeance on the Frontier
1.4 The Tarnished Star
1.5 Death Rides a Horse

A fast playing card game for two players. The rules are deceptively simple and after the first run through it appears that luck is the all deciding factor. It isn't. There are different strategies to pursue for both players.

The cards are beautifully illustrated and the game is very addictive.

My love of the theme is probably bumping my rating up just a bit. This is a great 2-player card management game. It often seems to come right down to the wire, which makes me think that luck of the draw is a significant factor in who wins, but it's a really fun ride and there are a bunch of tough decisions to be made along the way. I really like how all the different cards have flavor and do different things but aren't really complicated at all, and you never have to keep track of more than a few of them. The focus is always on "OK, what am I going to do next?" rather than trying to keep track of the game state.

Hmmm... decision-making seems pretty limited.  It's all about the narrative here.  There are some tricks and a few interesting decisons per player per whole game, but that's obviously not so much...

This is really short game.  It's good - fillers should be fast and dynamic, but on the other hand the short playing time is a result of a limited decision-making possibility...  The latter coupled with the not-so-good replayability outweights the 'pros' (climate, nice dynamics, very even (and thus exciting) finishes in some plays) for me.

--

Other issues:

- Luck of draw probably evens out in the span of the whole game, but still it can be concerning that you might not see at all your best/just needed cards as you don't mill the whole deck during the game. [issue not easily resolvable - as you would need to lengthen the game or cut the decks (in variety or in the number of copies of cards); all these solutions are weak]

- Serious mechanics failures: escape to Mexico looks impossible.  This winning condition for the Colty player is some joke...  As well as one of the top bandits who needs to be killed very early in order to 'enlarge' one of the locations.  Although the latter _might've_been_ possible if the colonel McReady player could appoint a bandit character to be killed from the played action card (like 'Get the rope, boys')...

- 'Derail the train' is a great option.  It builds the tension and prevents the game to be announced a win for one side too early.

A quick, thematic filler game done so much better than Munchkin.  There's not really much to this game and much of what there is to it is 100% the luck of the cards, but it's short (can be played in about 20mins) which is the right length for this sort of game.

Initial Rating: 5.5

I’m a huge fan of Stronghold games so when I played Revolver it was a huge disappointment.  First of all I don´t like the western theme but I also found the gameplay to be very boring, so I don´t think I will be playing it again. It appears the Sheriff team has a lot of advantage in the game, I played 4 times and the sheriff team won no matter which of us played with it. I came close to winning with the Outlaws and perhaps I can learn to play better but I’m not willing to spend my time playing this again. To remove cubes form the Mexican Border car is ridiculously hard so there isn’t really an option to win the game here.  For this reasons, I feel the game is VERY unbalanced (semi broken), perhaps an expansion can fix this.

I feel there is almost no game in this, no interesting decisions as almost always is obvious which of your cards you need to play. It has a lot of luck and no way to mitigate it, if you got bad cards there is nothing you can do about it. 

On the plus side, the game is easy to teach and doesn’t take long, the art is very good.


Bottom line, for me the game is very weak, I’m willing to play it once a year perhaps.

I like this western themed card game. It's a little like Battleline... but not really, I guess. It has the play-cards-on-a-base mechanism, but the bases are actually a progressive timeline, which adds an element of when to play a card, not just where. I've only played this once, and I'd definitely like to play it more.

It's like watching 3:10 to Yuma, only on your dining room table and not on your TV screen.


I'm a sucker for the Western theme when its done well, and Revolver does it well.  The production values are good, nothing special, though.  All of the art is excellent, contributing to the western type feeling.

As for the game, its sort of ok, varying from intense and fun one playthrough to boring and completely lopsided in others.  The asymmetrical 2-player style is interesting and makes it different, but, as I mentioned, it can have its flaws, depending upon the deck randomization.  Overall, I enjoyed this game, having played it more than a few times, but I think its time to catch that train and move on to greener pastures.

I think the real appeal of this game was its Western Theme.  These days I just have too many Western Themed games and the gameplay itself wasn't really enough to set itself apart.

Two player survival game with a Western theme. It's a re-visioning of an earlier game by the same designer, that was based on the movie, Aliens. Once you understand that, it all makes sense, as the outlaws are the hapless space marines, while the lawmen are the swarms of xenomorphs that are trying to kill them before they escape. I like the asymmetrical play, the well-integrated theme, and the rapid gameplay. I don't happen to like the tin that it comes in, as the game would easily fit into a much smaller box (even with the expansions). Play it like survival horror and it's pretty good. Very tense, but for some reason I couldn't get into it.

Revolver was a surprise for me.  I had heard a little about it and found it on sale.  There is a lot more to this game than I had thought.  A pleasant surprise.

This one takes a while to really get a feel for - hence many people claiming one side or another has an obvious advantage. After a few plays both sides learn what cards are available and how to plan for acceptable losses. Then it really shines and is a great example of asymmetrical gameplay.

cool looking game, but frustating that there is a chance of never getting the cards you need to win the game because you dont go through your whole draw pile during playing the game and some cards are just essential. Also not sure about replayability and toughness of decisions you have to make in this game. But Race for the Galaxy and Summoner Wars raised the bar to almost unattainable standards for cardgames when it comes to these points.

EDIT: toughness of decisions after 5 plays: autoplay
replay value: 5 plays

RATING: 8
Revolver is certainly a challenging and really fun game, especially if you are a fan of westerns, and a nice change from the usual fantasy/sci-fi card games out there. It is great to have fixed decks and a complete game as well and the great backstory really brings the game to life beyond the mechanics which are pretty solid and easy to follow. The whole package looks excellent and again adds to the atmosphere. The rules are clear, the mechanics and structure effective and the journey consistently strong. The variety is enough to keep your attention and the turns of fate both frustrating and exciting in equal measure. The decisions about how and when to deploy your resources and firepower will keep you in the thick of things, trying to outsmart the other player. And, it plays pretty fast too.

For me though, the best part of the game is the tense storyline as the game progresses through the 5 battlefields. Essentially, you have a series of gunfights with the Colty Gang losing members of their gang as they race for the 3:15 Express from Rattlesnake Station or the Mexican Border. The Colonel Ned McReady player is under pressure to utilize attacks well and quickly kill off the Colty Gang members before they can get away. It all comes together and works very well.

Revolver is fun, easy to play, (although there is a bit of initial reading including backstory to get through) interactive, action packed, dripping with theme and a jolly good romp through a spaghetti western. It is limited to 2 players and not everyone may be interested in the theme but it is a well designed, strong addition to the 2-player card game category.

A really great 2-player game where one side controls the forces of Colonel McReady who is out to gun down the outlaw 'Colty' gang. 

The game uses card management and the playing of cards to locations to drive the play but what is really fantastic here is that the game manages to develop a narrative and a story as the play unfolds. 

Few card games manage to create game play that replicates the theme so well and Revolver should be applauded for that. 

The artwork and general presentation is also excellent.

Excellent 2p game. It's a bit imbalanced in favor of the lawmen out of the box, but expansions really help fix that.

Can be very luck-based, but I have a great deal of fun with Revolver.

Asymmetrical card game with fairly simple mechanics but a decent amount of depth.  Games can twist and turn right until the end, and both sides have enough options to explore different routes to victory.  I would have preferred this with the original theme, but this is a decent lightish filler, fun as well.

Having rescued this from the dust and given it a little more love I have raised it to an 8.  It does those things more complicated games do but with a set of rules which is easy to understand, playing quickly and easily.  Really enjoying this one and hoping to explore it some more, maybe adding in a couple of the expansion decks but using one of the official variants.

RATING: 7
Easy 2 player that's thematically evocative and prone to hamming up, increasing the enjoyment. The game is simple enough - play out cards against the current objective and assess who has the most strength there after the sheriff's turn. If it's the sheriff (which is likely as he gets to go last and the bandits are limited to just 3 cards per objective), then he gets to kill off one of the 16 bandits. If the sheriff didn't kill off anything on his turn, then the bandits are one step closer (out of 12) to escaping over the Mexican border and one step closer to getting on the last train out of time (which always happens) so there's 2 time clocks in the game. The sheriff wins if all 16 bandits are dead. The decks are nicely asymmetrical without being too different. Games are usually close. There's luck in whether you get your good cards early or not. There are decisions to make on which objectives to fight for - some provide more defense to the bandits and objectives vary between how many turns they last, so save your good cards for objectives that will be fought over 6 turns rather than those over 2 turns. There's lots of powerful event cards so nothing's ever a lock and there are twists and turns. The artwork is nice. All up it's a pleasant game that's fun to play with the kids especially.

(10+ plays)  This is my favorite new game in a long, long time.  It's an extremely fast take-that! card game, but with a very cinematic sensibility that actually creates a story as you play.

In another, I crossed the Mexican border alone and nearly dead, after a prison break and a hostage crisis that didn't go so well for the hostage...  Highly recommended.

This may not be a bad game but it just did not excite me (even though I love the western theme.) You try to lay down the most defense points and then there are some cards that allow you to do other things such as kill one of your opponent's guys or move defense points from a previous battlefield to the current battlefield, just to name a couple of examples. At the end of each turn you add up defense points to see if the good guys killed a bad guy. Then on to the next battlefield for the same thing, rinse and repeat. It just did nothing for me. Sold it.

15-04-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Revolver is a asymmetric 2P card game. One side is the sheriff, trying to kill Outlaws, while the outlaws try to get away by surviving X rounds and trying to get off to Mexico OR remove 12 blocks on the Border card. The track on which the Outlaws travel is a quite straight one, made up of several locations where the outlaws stay for quite a while. However, this is dependent on the setup scenario chosen.

Each turn, players draw 2 cards. They are then allowed to play cards. First the Sheriff finishes their turn by playing an 'unlimited' amount of (often) Deputy cards that adds Sheriff 'strength' to that location. All deputies give you a bonus in strength (white pokerchip) and a special ability that allows you to straight-out kill outlaws, or draw cards, do something special. The outlaw than may play cards to match the strength of the Sheriff. If that happens, he removes one of the 12 blocks from the Mexican border card, unless the Sheriff killed an outlaw that turn.

Revolver is simple, but quick, fun, handmanagement game. The artwork is really nicely done too. I did like it.

We are still getting the feel for the game mechanics. Sometimes it seems too easy, sometimes too hard... sometimes just right. But I love the theme.

On the first play through, I misinterpreted the game rules to think that the Colty gang could directly deploy its gang members, and my opponent sent Bullet the dog after me with a stick of dynamite in its mouth. That was pretty funny....

Somewhat luck based western themed ard game.  Actually a fun light game that can be played in ~30 minutes. If deep strategy is what you crave move on, otherwise this is fun and fairly inexpensive.

RATING: 6
There's a core game here with the potential to be so much better than this published version. A little bit of the right development and testing and they could have had an excellent game here. What they have instead is a fun little 20 minute game that's easy to learn and play. If you're just looking for some fun and nothing too deep then this game will deliver. It's decent, but it could have been one of the top rung games of the year.

Where it falls down is in just a few areas that could easily be fixed. Firstly they needed to have a deck that each player would get through over the course of a game. For instance, it makes a huge difference to the Colty Gang whether they get the Sandstorm card or not. Play it on the train, just as the law is about to throw everything at you, or on a battleground with good defence, then add a negative time to burn up the Mexico markers. It's the best Colty Gang card in the deck and yet it might not come out in the game if it's in the final quarter of the deck. If the deck would be played through at about the two-thirds point of the game then players would have the choice when to use certain cards. These one off cards stay on a battle location and therefore would not be recycled through the deck.

Secondly, there needed to be a few surprises to mix things up. Choices are too obvious. Cards are too similar - Colonel McReady has 11 Bounty Hunters and about the same number of Deputies. There's always a best bandit to kill off, a least useful card to discard, etc. (Why does the Colty Gang even have a "Draw two cards" card? It's a pointless card. You pick it up and use it because two other cards are always going to be better. It's a card that cries out for a second use - a decision to be made whether to hold it or play it.) Play falls into just beating your opponent with the minimum investment required. There's some small scope to lure your opponent to play cards in a wasteful manner. This needs to be developed. Protecting your powerful fighters with cheaper deputies and bounty hunters is good play, but still needs to be a harder decision to make whether it's worth it. There needs to be some face down cards that can be played. Traps, traitors and tricks.

As is we've got a fairly decent quick game that comes in a stupid tin full of way too much air. I implore publishers to be more reasonable with their box sizes. The smaller the box the more I can fit on the shelves, the more I buy.

RATING: 6.5
Disappointing.  Seven plays, six McReady victories.  Seems like 90% of the game is simply the accident of the sequence of cards in each deck.  Would like to rate this game higher, but as of now, cannot.

(8-1-12)Have now played 25 or so games. 15 McReady vs 10 Colty.  Becomes more balanced with LOTS of play...and that is a problem for your average Wesley Hardin who buys the game in his local hobby store and plays with a friend.  Would recommend some restrictions on the McReady player for the first few games.

I'm getting increasingly addicted now we've got it right - the rules are pretty much as they should be but it's easy to miss a point or two skimming through initially. Fast-playing and the best balance I have yet found in an asymmetric game. Can be explained to a new player in less than five minutes, and as only half the cards are used in each game there is a lot of variety in style and result; a nice blend of luck, tactics and tough decisions.

RATING: 7.3
Based on 4 plays, but three of those with completely the wrong rules.

It seems to be a pretty interesting, asymmetrical game that plays quickly and has a decent number (but far from overwhelming) number of choices.

Further plays may reveal that this tends to play itself, but I'm willing to give it the benefit of the doubt and investigate further.

I like it. There a lot of interesting decisions to make.

Sold our second copy through a local game store's flea market in an attempt to get some space back in our house.

Update: Raised from a 6 to a 7 after a couple more plays. It's a pretty solid game. I'm a little curious how easy it is for the Colty gang to win, though. It seems awfully hard. Every game has ended with them getting gunned down.

Luck of the draw can be mitigated slightly by tactical play but not enough.  Don't get me wrong, I don't like euros where you can set your strategy from the beginning of the game, but I want to be able to play tactically with what I am given and not have luck of the draw totally screw me.   Expansions seem to add deck construction, which then makes the game about who constructed a better deck and again, the gameplay/tactics are mute.  3.0 because there is possibility for some tactical play.

Juego de combate entre 2 personas, en el que cada jugador posee un mazo diferente de 62 cartas. El mazo del Coronel McReady (los buenos) es más potente, pero el tiempo corre en su contra y debe eliminar a 16 Bandidos antes de que se escape Jack Colty (el malo) por la Frontera Mejicana o en el Tren de las 3:15. Sus expansiones y cartas promo te permiten personalizar tu mazo metiendo cartas nuevas (quitando otras para no exceder de 62 cartas), además de otros pequeños módulos.

Super. Some very nice original ideas in here, and pleasing gameplay. One of those that as soon as we played it we played it again (and secretly I wanted to play it again after that!)
My only concern is longevity. I'm not sure if it has got more than half a dozen plays in it, mainly because it is so scripted. This means that's it's fun to play, but might get predictable? We'll see.

RATING: 8
Thematic and fun, Revolver is one of the better asymmetrical-deck two-players out there. In the early going, it seems to me that things are stacked a little in the Colty Gang's favor ... I'll be interested to see if others share that opinion. This game is all about timing and knowing when to cut your losses and stock up for a different battle ... while still not giving the other player a free pass. Tough choices and room for a bit of strategy in addition to lots of tactics.

Pretty fun little game. My only complaint is that card draws can really cause problems. If you get hit with one of the road block cards at the right time, and you don't happen to draw a card to counter it, you can be at a pretty severe disadvantage.

Still, the game seems fun enough and my rating could change with more plays.

First Impression:

A surprisingly good thematic 2p game.

It's essentially a hand management game with a lot of theme (tons of it actually). It plays smoothly, creates a lot of tension and narrative and has surprising depth.

The "board"/path of cards doesn't change from game to game however (they could have done more in this regard) and therefore the game may lack in replayability. 

I'm looking forward to play this more. If it stands the test of time, it's definately a little gem.

Athmosphere is nice, but I was not too enthuastic or engaged about the rest of the game, unfortunately.

Update after 3 plays, rating: 5.5->6. It feels a bit better now. It is quite fast and easygoing, which is nice. The game play however feels sometimes too obvious. I have a feeling that paying optimally is not too difficult and in the end, luck of the draw is what really matters.

RATING: 6
7 rating is after two plays. 

First the bad: The rules for this game suck.  Hardcore.  It is very difficult to understand the flow of the game and the effect of the cards given the written rules.  Just look at BGG's multiple rules question threads.  Revolver has a lot of these threads.  What's astonishing is that this is actually a simple game.  No reason for this at all.

It's taken two plays to actually get this game.  First one felt like chaos, but that was mostly because we played incorrectly.  I think we're at about 95% correct now and the game is making a lot more sense.  The chaos isn't as bad as the game's critics make it sound.

Might adjust this 7 with more plays - and this will get them.  This is possibly a keeper.

Edit: Downgraded to a 6 and traded away.

The sheriff must kill all the outlaws before the end of the game. There are 4 area's in which they fight (devided again in "fights". The outlaws have a lot of people to kill but can only place 3 attackcards in 1 area. A fight is won buy the person having the most attackpoints. 

The extra cards change the outcome off the game by adding points, killing people, ...

A very nice 2 player game in which it is important not to shoot everything in the beginning off the game.

Disappointed with this game.  It's almost like both players have number cards, about 40 with a 1 and some 2's.  So the Sheriff has + cards and the bandits have - cards.  You both draw and play your cards and the team to sway the score to +5 or - 5 respectively wins the game.  That's how it feels but it is covered up by some great art and a sweet theme.  Fail

Two player Old West card game. The Sheriff and the good citizens of Repentance Springs are trying to bring the Colty gang to justice before crossing the border. Removing tokens from the Mexican border tile adds time pressure and a sense of urgency on the good guys that I really like.  Good guy and bad guy decks and a special gang member deck. Play cards to six locations with modifiers and finish effects to resolve shootouts.  The trick is figuring out which locations to forfeit or make a stand. Might be samey since the start up and order of gangster kills is in fixed order.  Has quite a few expansions that further the story line.

Inmiddels voor het eerst gespeeld. Spel is erg leuk en spannend tot het eind.

De spelers kruipen in de rol van de bandieten of de sterke arm der wet en elke speler heeft een uniek doel in het spel. De bandieten moeten ontsnappen, wat betekent dat ze of de trein moeten halen van Rattlesnake Station of de mexicaanse grens oversteken en de wet moet alle bandieten zien uit te schakelen voordat dit zover is.

Best een vermakelijk spel, waarin de sterke arm der wet wel duidelijk in het voordeel is, maar die heeft dan ook gedurende het spel een achterstand in te halen. Heb nu nog alleen gespeeld als de sterke arm der wet, volgende keer met de bandieten.

[b]"Anyhow, I used to heard it said you boys who rode with Hood drank five states dry. You could always tell where Hood's Texans had been by the empty bottles and the dead Yankees."[/b]

[i]Mexican Border victory condition:[/i] Some folks seem to think this is an impossible path to victory. Not so - designed to be very difficult. It is more a deliberate punishment for poor play by Col. McReady than a reward for good play by Jack Colty. This is further enhanced by some upcoming expansion cards.
Without it, players would stockpile cards and the game would stagnate.

[i]Drawing cards at the beginning of your turn:[/i] It has been suggested that drawing cards at the beginning of your turn, rather than at the end, is a crummy rule. I will concede that for new players, it would be preferable for them to draw cards at the end, so that they had time to read and study the cards before their next turn. The trouble I have with this change, is that it reduces the excitement you get at the beginning of your turn when you draw new cards, but my biggest problem with this suggestion is that a lot of players simply forget to draw cards at the end of their turn. Many players do this - it's intuitive, for some reason, to draw at the start and not at the end. If you took a dollar from me for each player I've seen who forgot to draw cards, during games where you do draw at the end of your turn, and had to be reminded - I'd be poor.

Also, it's now obvious that nobody has read any of the biographies included with each rulebook - if they had, they'd realise that Colonel Ned McReady is as big a villain as Jack Colty, maybe more so.

Played this game today for the first time, and it’s very hard to judge it. What this game does, is suck you into the theme. The theme is Wild West, and you really have the idea that you’re in the Cody area 100 years ago fighting bandits or (if you’re the other player) stay out of sight of the Sheriff and his deputies. The artwork is awesome. Some how it reminds me of the old (spaghetti)-westerns of Clint Eastwood. The text on top of the cards, however seems to me quotes of John Wayne.

BGG talks about two balanced decks of cards. To me it seems they are not balanced very well. It really isn’t that hard for the law to win the game. In real life I would cheer if that was the case, but in gaming…. Well, let’s say chances have to be the same for both sides. Maybe we didn’t shuffle the decks good enough, so that might be a cause for the problem. Fact is, there’s a lot of luck involved in this one. You draw the cards from your deck. If you have bad luck, you draw very strong cards in the beginning of the game when you don’t need them. And in the end, all that’s left over, are the weak cards. We’ll have to try this one a couple of more times, before we can make a final judgment. It sure has possibilities. Maybe we need to make some adjustments to the rules. Like splitting up your deck in five smaller decks. In each scene, you can use one deck. Then shuffle the deck. Maybe. I’ll have to think about this one.

A highly thematic game, with lots of cool cards but not too many strategic (or even tactical) choices. My girlfriend loves it; I think it's because it is so very easy to play, lasts about 30 minutes, and keeps the theme always at the forefront.

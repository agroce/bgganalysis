This game is underrated. 

Beautiful compnents and high quality material for a nice-looking boardgame. No dice to roll or random cards to draw (you don't need to be lucky to win) and it's the only game which combines such mechanics (hand management, simultaneous action selection and area control) with original solutions (at least) in my collection. Moreover it can be blayed even in 6 and it works fine! I can't understand why it's so poorly rated...

Have read various comments which would indicate that the game is too chaotic with only the last player of the round able to truly determine the surviving island segment when several are contested. However, after many plays in my games group we all had an absolute ball, despite the game being a little longer than it should have due to a bit of AP. In fact the game was a real battle and great fun! I can highly recommend it, and planning and bluffing really do  make a difference! My only misgiving is the value of houses at the end. In our 4 player game 2 players -  myself and one  other - were left on the last segment, myself with 3 houses and he with 2.  Since the houses are worth 3 points each, I won despite the fact that he had been leading on captured house count all game - which I felt was unfair. Excellent fun competitive and backstabbing game though! 
edit: after further plays, no misgivings about house values remain!

Bluffing game as you try and protect your (secretly allocated) colour from drowning in a sinking city.

You can take many actions that move, protect or harm pawns, and nominated certain areas of the board for watery destruction - but don't tip your hand too much or you will get dunked next.

It was good fun.

Good production and nice artwork. I also liked the theme of angry gods sinking a city, while trying to save a chosen district and colour of people.  There's fun to be had from many take that cards, but the overall effect, certainly with five players, is wildly chaotic.

I like this game quite a bit, and I think it's a little under-rated.  Yes, I get why people complain about the chaos with more players (although I have only played 2 players myself), but there is much less chaos with fewer players.  I found the game tense throughout--every decision mattered and some were downright excruciating to make.  The rules, as well as the end-game scoring, is simple and straightforward.  This game reminds me a lot of Metropolys, another game I like and that plays in about the same amount of time.

UPDATE: I have subsequently played games with 3, 4 & 5 players and the game is just as fun, although a bit more chaotic, as it is with 2 players.  This one gets requested a lot.

Definitely not a "gamers' game". Maybe a family game, but I could see where some casual gamers might be put off by the easy ability of others to destroy your plans. If it were the ONLY game available and I didn't want to be a COMPLETE jerk, I'd sit in on another play. But it was TOTALLY  un-engaging in my mind; simply a superfluous way to kill 45 minutes until other games were done.

RATING: 7
Some nice hand-management aspects to this one.  However, a lot seems to come down to (a) what island slice you draw and (b) where your citizens start.  Hidden player colors seem to attempt to assuage the issue of kingmaking or spite-killing.  

Quite terrible with 2-3 players, since there is little you can do to influence island sinking against superior cards in that case.  With more, it opens up a lot of conspiring and table talk, and keeps the game unpredictable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Overall, an okay set collection game.  Yeah, it looks and acts a bit like its an area control / majority game - but that's really an illusion.  The game play is actually about cooperative bidding via semi-blind bidding to determine which part of the island is destroyed thus washing many unfortunate people out to sea where temperamental gods collect their lost souls as victory points.  The shrinking game board is a nice twist on game design and oddly leaves players somehow hoping, if just barely, that some of 'their' people survive the end of times.  The contrast of actively wiping out a population while also thinking of saving some makes watching the psychology of the players almost more interesting than the game play.

This is mainly a card game where you are trying to guess what actions others will make and then pick your best card. I like the puzzle-type board and the secret goal tiles. The art on the cards is a bit of a let down as many are not distinct enough and can easily be confused. All in all, a fun game for three players. I think it would be too chaotic with more.

A bit lighter than I had expected, which felt wrong for this sort of game which is probably too complex for a family game yet too light and chaotic for a gamers game. This became apparent when some of our card combinations did not seem to be accommodated by the rules very clearly and, ultimately, our gaming resulted in us blasting each other out of existence for a 3 way tie.

This is a game in the category of "action games", games where a lot of stuff happens and you make a lot of choices but the ultimate result is far too chaotic really for your choices to have much, if any, impact on the final result. I can see there is an audience for this sort of game, especially for family-type gaming situations. Unfortunately, I am just not in that target audience.

Cool little take-that game.  I just love that we are destroying the island and trying to take down a specific color of village with us :)  Like most take-that games you really can't form any strategy, just play turn-by-turn and see what happens.  There is room for some bluffing, though, and I just found it to be a lot of fun.  

If you want a quick, fun take-that game, Vineta certainly fits the bill.

Our first (and only) play did not go really well. We spent a lot of time referencing the player aid to try to understand what the special cards did.  Some of them were not worded well, and there was a mistake on the reference sheet (2 of the card descriptions are reversed, and we didn't realize until close to the end of the game). The amount of time spent trying to figure out the rules seemed disproportionate to the amount of strategy you could use and the amount of control you have over the outcome of the game.  Many of the special cards are very situational, so you spend time figuring out what it does, only to have it sit unused in your hand. The cards to move or protect houses seemed especially useless, because in order to play them, you have to miss out on playing a wave towards that turn's wave surge, which reduces your chances of sharing in the prize points for that round. And there is no way to know in advance if the place you move the houses to will be any more safe than where they were. 

At the end of the game, the last wave surge was tied, which means all players play another wave card to break the tie.  Unfortunately I ended the game with full hand of useless event cards, and no wave cards to use towards the tie.

It's possible that some of these problems may have been related to the fact that we tried it with only 3 players, the lowest number you can play with. This means there are less houses in play, which may make the house-related special cards less useful (I can't say for sure though). The rule interpretation problems would certainly be reduced on a second play, but due to the poor experience I had the first time, I can't see myself being motivated to try again.

The original German edition.

I really like having the larger pieces and the board.  I was surprised by how much mileage the kids got out of seeing each sea monster revealed as the city was lost to the waves.

Some have complained that there's chaos in this game and that the theme is paper-thin.  Obviously, those folks never played D&D where Norse gods were involved.  If they had, they'd know the Norse gods are (mostly) chaotic, Chaotic Good, to be specific, for Odin and Thor and (most) friends.

Seriously, if you've ever looked at Norse mythology the gods were larger than life: great power, great might, and, quite often, great oops.

Now, maybe the theme would be more supported if the village was perched on the edge of fjord, and the gods sent avalanches of snow down on the city, but, really, it works quite well with the theme as is.

Interesting game but feels similar to great fire of london as you are trying to save houses of your (secret) colour and destroy the other houses.

There are also points available for keeping your section of the city floating at the end of the game but as the game ends when there is only a single remaining city section this bonus feels pretty redundant.

Three players is a little unbalanced as if the other players decided to join fores to sink a section of the city there is very little the other player can do and thus there can be a run away leader problem if one player keeps allying with another and mopping up on points. 

Sold in a board game bundle in 2017.

Thoroughly enjoyed this game and recommend to anyone looking for a light weight game of influence. Played as a 3p game and we had a blast, very funny. The only mark against it is the teeny graphics on the cards, which tell you what the card actually does. Whyohwhyohwhy do they still mark cards with icons that cannot be read?? Also, the game board is completely not needed, you only need the island tiles. Apart from that, lots of fun and a must-buy game if you like this sort of thing.

RATING: 6.8
Atlantis sinking is not an uncommon theme, but I like the way this one is constructed.  Nine districts on an island of which, eight the Gods will sink. You are a god secretly trying to preserve one district and one color of house. 

Vineta is a game of deduction with bluffing and multiple opportunities for strategy.  It requires judicious playing and hording cards.  

There are eight rounds with three turns each, and a unique way of keeping track with a 2-part turn order token. 

Love the look of the game--the board & components.  It is in a nice small box that easily fits on the shelf and transports.  The easy rules are well written & Illustrated, and includes a nice reference sheet, which I laminated.  However, the reference sheet is quickly put aside because the card actions are graphically depicted, and easily interpreted. 

It lasts 30-60 mins depending on the number of people.  Three players is okay, but 4-6 is better because there is more a tug of war for which district sinks.  

Would be nice to have a scoring track for the scoring--not necessary, but I always like a graphic picture of how everyone finishes-especially if 6 are playing.

RATING: 7
I've only played once, three player.  It was fun and finished closer than I thought it would.  It reminds me most of Dynasties, with the blind card play.  Maybe a little Clans thrown in as well with the secret identities.  Getting in on a sinking area gives you spoils, sort of like Pacific Typhoon.  All of the above leave me thinking it's either not very original or I've played too many games.  Really a good looking game on the table and fast as well.  The shrinking island is my favorite and it has that juicy destruction theme that I enjoyed in Pompeii.  This is much more random than Pompeii but moves quicker.  I think the U.S. edition is just fine and is cheap and compact.  The wooden huts are fairly chunky.  Average card stock but points for being full sized cards.

Look forward to playing more!

RATING: 6
One of those games in which control is rather restricted due to the combination of blind-bidding, hidden loyalties and random assignation of scoring region.  If you're lucky, your region won't get sunk and there's a boon for you; if you're lucky another player will manage to play the right card so that your plan doesn't go awry; if you're lucky you will get through the entire game without somebody having and inkling of which colour you are AND score something from it at the end.

The only real strategy seems to be chasing houses by sinking regions; but even that is a path fraught with randomness.  This is the kind of game I'll only play occasionally; I would rather not own it.

A great idea and a very poor execution. The beginning is great: as a god you determine which houses and which district get to be saved from a flood of an ancient city. You start playing and ask yourself - why am I falling asleep?

There is one element of this game that could make it an excellent title - the action cards. And the actions are so simple that no matter how hard you try it can't get any more complicated than Schildkroetenrennen. The latter is at least for kids...

Clans meets Thor (or Flinke Pinke/Loco)

It is somewhat more chaotic than Thor/Loco, but with quadruple the playing time.  There is precious little control.  There are too many special cards for only three (+/-1) rounds per flood.  Playing a special card prevents you from gaining a place in a stack, so there is little chance to capitalize on any changes you affect.

Admittedly, this is after only one play.  That was only with 4P, but even then the chaos seemed to dominate.  I won the game, but I made at least a couple mistakes and revealed my color early on.  I certainly did not think I was playing well.  I can not imagine there being any control at all with 5 or 6.  I would try once more if asked, but would never request it.

The action cards may be a little too prevalent, but they are manageable.

I do like the shifting alliances and quick turns of fortune that can take place each turn.

If you like some backstabbing and screwage in your games, then give this a go!

The sinking island has been done already and surprisingly, with much greater success in earlier designs.  If you want to play a game in this vein, try Survive or Pompeii.  Either will give you more bang for the buck.  The game is overly long and when you compound that with the luck involved, its just not something I can recommend.

You play cards trying to sink parts of an island or move your pieces to safety. You are also trying to save one of the nine pieces of the island which can give 2, 4, or 7 points. A tile for each the island piece and color to save are randomly distributed at the beginning of the game. There are three rounds with three turns. You are supposed to turn over the cards simultaneously which adds a lot of chaos. It is also a little annoying to have to move the start player token after every turn. Overall it just didn't seem that fun to play.

OK - I work for the company who is considering to publish this game. As a businessman - I love every one of our games.....as a gamer, of course I have ones that I like and dislike. For my tastes, Vineta is the best game I've played in a long time. It has a great combination of strategy and luck. The theme of the game is great and there is good interaction between the players. I've played in a 2 player game and a 4 player game and it's been great each time. I would not want to play with more than 4 players. For my tastes, more than 4 is too much to keep track of!

I can see how many people would not like this game.  There isn't much control, especially when you consider that nearly everything on the board will be gone by the end of the game, but I'm never really bothered by chaos.  And while the chaos is inevitable, it is still somewhat manageable if you can manipulate the groupthink taking place or confuse your opponents.  I like the theme of the game and it makes sense - of course the gods would conspire to destroy this place! :)  Vineta is especially enjoyable for groups that like to take jabs at each other, you can potentially be pretty mean to the other players, but the game is short enough that it doesn't really matter all that much if everyone else figures out who you are and tries to kill all of your houses.

Well it is something to look at. The board is quite different from what I am used to seeing with its city sections that can be destroyed. The wood houses are the same quality as any other wood components.  I found the first play kind of ho hum. There was never much competition over which section of the city was to be destroyed. Players wanted to be sure to be able to get some houses off the section to be destroyed to score so they tended to jump on the bandwagon when someone bid to sink a certain section.  The action cards made for an interesting twist but it also appeared that everytime you played one on someone else there was certain to be retribution from that player. 

I'd play again if someone asked, but I don't think I would be the one to suggest it.

RATING: 6
Not a bad game, plenty of evil fun to be had here though I would say it is not for serious gamers or those who try to think through all the permutations before making a choice. By all means do some planning, but take a card and play it and see how the dice(?) fall.
The game play is smooth and balanced (well as balanced as it can be for a game of this nature)and should be played for fun - did I mention the fun you can have in destroying portions of an island, saving your houses, shoving others into the danger zone - all good clean despotic fun. 
My only comment would be that my game came with a board upon which to assemble the island which gets pulled apart during play. Other than that the game board serves no useful purpose at all and anyone who is not intelligent enough to put together the 9 part jigsaw puzzle without it should be banned from playing on the basis that they would probably eat the playing cards mistaking them for crisps. This is a case of OVER-PRODUCTION and a complete waste of money which I assume is passed on to the consumer.

Very pretty and very chaotic.

Colorful artwork on board and district pieces. The theme of gods destroying an island is also a plus. Those compliments aside, chaos is what this game is about, not strategy. This is because everyone chooses an action at the same time, but play them in turn order. When it is your turn to play a card, the board situation may have changed drastically, nullifying your card choice.

Too bad as I really wanted to like this game.

For those unfamiliar, each player is a Norse god and collectively we are sending our fury upon this little island city. But each of us has a secret favorite type of meeple and a favorite district and we don't want to destroy those (and if we do, we want to collect them rather than those other gods). This is done by playing cards - each god has their own identical deck. Everyone picks the one they wish to play this round and then in turn order (which shifts predictably) each player plays their card. The basic card is a wave which is effectively a number of votes for destroying that part of town, but there are also ways to mess with the waves, move the meeples around, etc, etc. When the cards are played out, the district that has most wave heading its way gets destroyed and the meeples in that region getting shared out among those that contributed to that wave. Scoring is pretty simple: 1 point for a claimed meeple, 2 points for a claimed meeple in your secret color, 3 points for each favorite meeple that remains in the final district, plus a number of points for having your district survive (all but one are destroyed) which depends on how near the edge of the city it is - much harder to keep a wall district alive so if it happens it is quite a few more points.

Though our game took quite a bit longer than advertised, due to restarts and confusion, once we got to it, it was quite entertaining. But I would not say it was deep or engrossing. Simultaneous action selection is not a favorite phrase of mine in any case and when your played card is rendered worthless and/or pointless by the previous plays, it tends to make me think poorly of the game. There is also a large +/-7 card that tends to pretty much decide the battle for the district alone and I think I might like the game better if there was not such a huge swingy card in the game. But on the other hand it should be a relatively short game that looks like it scales well and as a quick lunch game or something light, it could fit the bill. The key here is not to take it too seriously.

Free game (choice of this or Terra Nova) for preregistering for AnCon 2013.  Definitely a nice little game mostly involving deduction of what other players are doing with area control.  But the card game aspect of it isn't all that great, and I could get the same interaction from other games.

Gave to Cody because he loves it, but methinks he also just doesn't have the other games with this type of interaction and better caliber to compare it to.

A game of trying to claim and shuffle houses and sink the zones of your choosing.  Manipulating things to score points for you and not others.  Good game.

Wildly chaotic and random, lots of screwage which feels nasty rather than fun in the 6 player version anyway. You can really feel picked on in this one. Mechanics work but no room for planning as luck plays a heavy part.

Excruciating. Yes, there's the chaos, but, at least for the first part of the game, it seemed to be on par with El Grande, which is loved despite the chaos. But the game eventually devolves into complete meaninglessness, as bonus regions are taken away, players have little incentive but to try to just get a piece of the section most likely to sink, which tends to be decided by the first player in turn order. Yes, there are some clever ploys you can pull off with the cards, like completely switching all the houses between two districts, but you can't count on actually getting that card in your hand at a time when you'd actually want to use it.

The chaotic nature of this game can at times mean that all strategy goes out of the window.  Definitely not for those who like to form a long term strategy as things can change dramatically with the turn of a card.  Despite this, I can't help but find myself enjoying it every time it hits the table!  The fact that it was picked up for only £10 makes it all the more sweeter.  The board and components are top quality as well!

We were a bit stymied in our first game by the dullards who translated the reference sheet (clue: it's all wrong) and the fundamental pointlessness of the 2P game, so I'm not yet convinced on Vineta's staying power. I am pretty much convinced, though, that there are too many 'special power' cards for its own good (and to maintain any semblance of control over the game). This desperately needs a good table-full to investigate further.

Based on one play: You are given a house color and location, both of which you would want to save from sinking. Place the houses on one of the nine island pieces and then using the cards, the players will chose locations to sink and can move houses around. Your goal is to save as many of your houses and the location your were given at the start (all of which is secret). Quite fun and plays in 30 minutes regardless of the number of players.

So chaotic that very little of what you do matters. With the blind bidding mechanism, the board position can end up totally the opposite of what you were aiming for by the time the turn gets back to you. Long term plans are only wishful thinking. The plus is that as long as you don't takeit seriously, it brings out a lot of laugh (or is that frustration!?) and a lot of  throwing your hands up and saying just let what ever the hell happens, happens. This review is after a single 5-player game, but it is clear to me that the game will definitely be much better with fewer players; best with 3, then 4.

US Edition:
Didn't care for the presentation. The puzzle board was a pain and I despised the cards with all the obtuse iconography.

Too chaotic for secret roles and missions. While everyone has the same card deck, having a limited subset for each round leads to the chaos. It appears you have a lot of choices, but the impact seems to be minimal.

If you want a secret mission/role scoring mechanism get Metropolys - a much superior game.

If you want a sink the land style game see if you can get Survive - a much superior game.

Got a chance to play a friend's copy of this over the weekend. Great game. Often in games with a bluffing mechanic, the whole game breaks down if someone correctly guesses or figured out your goal/color/etc. Not so in Vineta. Even if we'd known each other's secret island segment and color from the start, there would still be a whole lot of game left.

After only one play, I could see a place for this game in my collection and I'd like to acquire it; however, my one-time opponent wondered aloud how this game compared to Clans, which we both already own. Before I go hunting down a copy of Vineta, I'd like to answer that question.

I'm not going to give the game a rating yet, but if I did, it would probably hover around a 7.

April 2012: That last comment referred to a partial 6 player game. Down from 8 to 5.5

The game definitely outstays its welcome at six. Eight turns times three rounds = 24 turns! The game is very chaotic -- perhaps we could do some card counting; each player has the same deck of cards. However, players have only a small number of cards from their personal deck in hand, and some cards are quite powerful making long term planning futile.

Bonus point for the newer edition that comes in a much smaller box.

April 2011: Quick, fluffy, chaotic, take-that game that plays very well at six.

Players form temporary alliances during every round to determine which are of the board gets flooded/destroyed/screwed. I really like temporary alliances in multiplayer games since it keeps everyone involved and interested, as opposed to games that consist of 1-on-1 battles.

You play Norse gods secretly protecting one section of a sinking northern city and one colour of houses.  Cards are played to sink sections and to influence outcomes, like moving houses around, so there's interaction either in trying to get at a player or to save your people.  Cards and powers are not very clearly explained, however, and rules could be more straightforwardly laid out.  I prefer Drunter und Druber (Wacky Wacky West).

Uma ideia engraçada que esbarra na enorme variedade de cartas de habilidades e numas regras que não são assim tão fáceis, nem de interpretar, nem de colocar em prática.

26-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. Vineta is an intersting game in which you play norse gods trying to sink the Island City of Vineta. 

During the game all parts of vineta sink except one part. Each player obtains two hidden objectives, trying to keep a certain part of the city alive and another objective for surviving color wood pieces. Then, all players put wooden houses down on each of the island parts. 

Afterwards, people can nominate an area for sinking by playing a gulf card. More than one area can be nominated to sink each turn, but only the one with the highest gulf value actually sinks. Other cards allow you to increase or decrease gulf values, add buildings to the sinking city tile, remove buildings from the city tile etc.

The game reminds me a little of survive, but shorter and leaner. There is much interaction.

Assemble the nine districts of the island of Vineta, choose a Norse God, and then unleash your wrath on the island, sinking it piece by piece over eight rounds until only one district remains. By playing cards each round, you rearrange the houses on the island as it sinks, saving as many as you can to earn points. A fast playing game that usually takes us between 30-45 minutes with the opportunity to pull off some clever moves along the way.

Played once with 6 players and appeared too random. Perhaps with fewer players, you gain more control over what happens on the board. Also, the action symbols on the playing cards are difficult to tell apart.

[color=#CC0000]

    Island didn't sink quickly enough.

    There was no heat to this game at all, nothing that drew me in.  It seemed like an amalgam of C+ mechanics that didn't build off of each other.

    The card play was exceptionally arbitrary and might get better with three players, but in my group of five it just didn't matter what card I threw -- I didn't have sufficient control to be anything other than a spectator.  I can't help but think it would have been better to limit this game to less players.

    I just didn't care.  It's an awful thing to say about the game but it just seemed that any influence I had was immediately neutralized and at that point it just didn't seem to be worth spending the time to make a strategic decision.  A clever concept, but it just didn't work.  Maybe version 2 will have more bite to it.

RATING: 8
Somewhat surprisingly I liked it. Or not given my preference to interactive and bluffing game (hidden objectives) and my love for chaotic. 

If you need solid planning a need to feel your strategy implemented stay clear from this game. This is completely tactical game with constant back and forth a surprises and laughter and frustration all till the very end. Okay so you can plan for maybe only a move in advance, but I don't care, because the game is constantly engaging. Each your move can and will affect the whole board - and so will everybody else's. 

The game probably works because of two diametrically opposite ways to score points - 1) keep your district and houses from drowning and 2) get points from drowning houses. That's why you can always shift between both priorities to get the best out of situation. 

I've come to realisation I like this game because improvising in chaotic environment is what I consider fun. And this creates an engaging, enjoyable and tense ride for me. Another factor for this impression is also the artwork - it's just very cute and evocative (for me somehow of Venice and summer holidays).

Wow, I played this wrong.  I didn't realize that you were supposed to simultaneously select and reveal your cards.  This sounds terrible.  I suggest playing cards one at a time from your hand as sane humans normally do.

With the wrong rules: Not a bad little card game.  I think that it would be absurd to play this with any more than three players.  The game is already chaotic, but with three it is light and manageable with some nice baits and switches some lured allegiances and so forth.  With more it just would become a jumbled mess.  

There are a number of fun ways to play people off of each other. Unfortunately, it becomes pretty obvious quickly which color each player is, this game could use a dummy color.  Sadly, outside districts are too vulnerable to actually be worthwhile hidden scoring chits.  They are easy to get at, so the value of their remaining until the end of the game is increased dramatically to make up for it, but there is no good reason to let them make it for fear of someone getting that many points.

Good for people looking for a 3 player card game with cool scoring, otherwise, it is one of a million nice games.

With the right rules I'd imagine that I'd give this a 4.

The chaos factor in this one is admittedly high, but I say that it is enjoyable to go along for the ride.  The game plays best when at least two areas are threatened; in one game, too many people all tried to sink the same area and the entertaining tension was just not there.

Takes too long for a game that comes down to a couple houses left on one island.  There are just too many screw your neighbor type cards here to where your decisions really don't matter all that much in the end.  There is some strategy here, such as collecting houses, but much of it is blunted by all the special cards.  The strange part is the game is still kind of fun to play despite the flaws, but I can't see playing it repeatedly.

Competitive destruction. There's a delicate balance between being part of the gang that sends each district & its inhabitants to the deep, and trying to protect your special (secret) district & tribe.

Not a game I would play often as there is so much chaos in this one. No matter how hard you try to plan out your strategy, nothing ever goes according to plan due to the chaotic nature of this one. That said, if you don't mind that kind of anarchy in games you play, this may be a good game for you. It has a very nice idea and a strong, wonderful theme; "The Atlantis of the North".

Vineta looks like heavy filler but it has a steep initial learning curve.  Once you trudge through that first play, the result is very heavy on process, especially with successful gameplay being so subtle. It's an awful lot of work for something with so little direct control.

RATING: 6
What makes this such a great game to play is the secreacy aspect of the game. Nobody knows which color you are or the other players are. This makes it difficult to team up against one person. Many people complained of the chaos in the game and think it is mostly luck driven, but I beg to differ. There are tatics that can be used to sucessfuly score a victory, but these tatics are out of the norm and therefore I do not think most people spent the time required to learn these taticts. I believe those who rated the game low did not judge the game on what it is, but judged the game on what they wanted it to be. This is a short 45min - 60 min game with a light to medium depth, with secret player selecting, and some screw your neighbor. If you don't form a stratedgy I can see how some people think it is just chaos.

Think clans with limited action selection. There's quite a lot going on, with investment in regions to be destroyed with an interest in collection of the doomed houses, as well as trying to protect houses of your secret colour and your secret region.

With 3-players, it seems all too easy for every house to be destroyed by the end of the game, so the big points swings on regions have more effect. Gorgeous production, will try to play this with a different player count soon.

About [thing=27532][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=27532][/thing] is a quick-paced game mixing simultaneous action selection, partnerships, hidden goals and a whole lot of "take that" moments.

In [thing=27532][/thing] players are angry goods wanting to destroy the city of Vineta, sinking it into the sea. But every God has a tribe he or she wants to secretly protect and a region (probably where os located his/her sancturary) of the city to keep above the waters. Both of these are tough to do, as the others will most definitely not want the same thing as you - and only one region, of nine, will remain at the end. The odds in favor of Vineta and you aren't that great.

[thing=27532][/thing] plays fast: eight rounds of three turns each (it can be less or more than 3 turns, depending on some action cards), and the choice of cards to use is done simultaneous - the activation isn't, starting with the first player of the round and going clockwise.

The game not only allows but also thrive in partnerships among the Gods in order to send waves to sink a region of the city, or to prevent one from going under (be because you want to keep houses/tribes of your color in the city, or to defend the region is dear to you). And to do this there is a metric ton of take that cards, in which wave cards are swapped or discarded, houses change spots - some sent to destruction, others to safety -, Destiny cards that make huge differences in the force of the waves, Quarentines that prevent houses/tribes from leaving a place, and other effects.

If playing with 5 or 6, the chaos is almost total: there is no way to predict what will be revealed or to try to strategize or antecipate what your turn will be like, as so many things can happen before you play. With 3 or 4 the game is more manageable, and while it is still more tatical than strategical, there is more room to predict the choice of the others and remember what they already played.

Surprisingly, I enjoyed [thing=27532][/thing] more than expected.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
At first, each player receives one token showing which color she is trying to protect and another token showing which region she wants to keep afloat. Both these informations are secret until the end of the game.

In each round (there are 8 during the whole play) the player starts with 7 cards. Each player, simultaneously, picks a card and put it on the table. The first player of the turn reveals her card and use it. Then the next player will reveal her card and use it. And so on, going clockwise, until everyone has played a card.

The first player marker will pass to the next player in clockwise order. Every player will draw 1 card, and will select another card to be played. And the same proceedings of the turn will occur again. The round will, normally, end once everyone has played 3 cards.

The cards are of two types:
- Waves: these go from 1 to 4 in value, and are the cards that sink the regions of the city;
- Action: have several different effects, such as moving houses from one region to other, changing wave cards from no stack to the other, and so on.

Wave cards are put next to a region, indicating that it is threatening that region. Each player can only start one attack, but can participate in several. Players can add Wave card in any stack (either her own or one started by someone else). At the end of the round, the region which has the highest value in Wave cards will sink - leaving play. The houses in that region will be divided among the players that put Wave cards in that region - the pick of which house to take will follow the order in which the cards were placed, and it goes until there are no more houses left, which means players can receive more than 1 house from a single card.

Once the eight round is over, occurs the scoring. Players receive 1 point for each house they gathered of colors that they didn't want to protect, 2 points for houses of the color she was protecting, more points if the region she was trying to keep afloat was left in the end, and 3 points for each house of the color she was protecting still left on the board.

The player with the most points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which card to use and how best to use it. The player must consider the state of the board and:
a) how to take more houses, specially of the color that it is worth more;
b) how to protect the region you want to remain above the water;
c) how to prevent others from doing A and B.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- The art is very nice, and done in an old style, like that in [thing=73439][/thing] and [thing=105037][/thing];
- Plays fast, with little downtime, even with playing with 5 or 6, as the actions are short to be executed;
- Language independant (but getting used with the effects of the Action cards may need a couple of plays);
- Offers a good amount of decisions in a small frame of playing time;
- It is very pretty on the table at the start and the way the island is constantly being taken apart helps a lot to convey the theme of a sinking city.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Too chaotic when playing in 5 or 6;
- There is the luck of the draw - as some cards might only show when they can't be fully used;
- Little strategy - almost only tatical decisions;
- Can suffer from some bashing the projected leader (even worst than the bashing the actual leader).

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Surely noticing how helpless the people from Atlantis or Vineta were, as you will try, and likely fail, to keep the region you want and the people you favor afloat. It is like swimming against the tide, struggling in quick sand - made worst when the people around are more interested in seeing you sink.

[thing=27532][/thing] most likely won't be a hit with everyone, as the take that nature of the game is a big turn off to many, and the ever changing environment of the game is the heart of it. Still, the game is short enough to not overstay, the downtime is small and the pace of it expeditious to the point of the take that seem more like a bothersome nuisance than a truly hurtful manoeuvre coming from pure evil. In the end, [thing=27532][/thing] was more fun than I antecipated.

In Vineta, 2 to 6 players take on the roles of angry Norse Gods, seeking to sink the city of Vineta beneath a succession of pounding waves.
However, each player is secretly assigned one of nine city districts to protect. Likewise, each player secretly protects one color of houses.
By use of cards, players send waves against districts, joining together to sink them and moving houses in and out of threatened districts. At the end of each round, the district that has the most waves played against it -- along with any houses in that district -- are removed.
After eight rounds of play, only one district (and any houses it contains) will remain. Players score for houses claimed during the game, and bonuses are given to whoever was secretly protecting the remaining district and its remaining houses -- if any.

Clever mix of deduction (what color is everyone?), planning, card play, with some negotiation thrown in there.

However, it's also quite chaotic, and it is easy for one player to become collateral damage of another player's actions.

In my first play, I think I focused too much on trying to get my own buildings to be on the last city tile. It's hard to do, and other players will notice and make sure one color isn't overly represented. Much easier to grab pieces of your color off the board.

Good little bluffing game where you and your opponents take on the roles of gods and proceed to blast an island with tidal waves. You have to keep your people alive while drowning everyone else.

The game is quick enough to be considered filler, but the mind games of trying to make people think you are doing on thing when really doing another makes this one deep and fun on repeated plays.

I like the way that the timing adds to the inherent tension of the game, but I don't like that there's so much chaos in the design.  So much is left out of the players' control, and there's a lot of power given to whoever is playing last in the round.  He can decide to shorten or lengthen the round, or add the mack-daddy card to one surge or another, and while there are some ways that the other players in the game can try to alleviate some of that power, it means that they have to spend one of their powerful cards to prevent someone else from using theirs.  It's a bit of a crap-shoot, and I'm not sure I like that aspect of the game.  The rest of it is interesting, but nothing special or distinctive.  I'd play it again, but I won't ask to play it.

There aren’t many games around that you can play with up to 6 people. Also the theme sounded interesting to us. After reading the rules, we didn’t understand how to play the game. We really needed an example that was clear enough to made the rules of the game more clear, but there wasn’t one. How the game should work, only came from combining little things together and thinking how I should design it. This is not a game for unexperienced players.

This game provides a lot of chaos on the board. And most experienced players don’t like chaos. They want to have a certain amount of control about what is going on in front of them. As we played this with the two of us, this is not a game I could recommend to anybody. It could be more interesting with 4 or more players, but I don’t have any plans on trying it ever.

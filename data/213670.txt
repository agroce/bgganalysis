Like the Marvel Munchkin in general, this is one of the best uses of the engine for a pure beat 'em up, the rules haven't changed all that much from the original Munchkin, but if you're playing the fast style there are enough little tweaks here to perhaps give it another look.

Combined with Munchkin: Marvel it is the perfect Munchkin game for Marvel fans!

Own the Munchkin Marvel + Expansions which is much more balanced than this set. This deck is mainly based around 'stealing' cards. Games played were always a slog to get through and much less fun. Recommend getting the Marvel set if interested in the universe.

I think I actually prefer other Munchkin variants. The theme loses some points for me as I prefer something like Legendary for super heroes over this. Otherwise, there's not much difference from this over regular Munchkin.

Charming illustrations by Kovalik and amusing tongue-in-cheek humor, but the game ceased to be enjoyable once I discovered Euro games which made me more critical of how I spent my leisure time.

This game feels different that other versions of munchkin even if the mechanics are (mostly) the same. I think people who really like x-men will probably enjoy it more than I did though.

Quite fun: It keeps largely to the mechanics of standard _Munchkin_ with cards for: Powers, Affiliations and Allies.   Simple to learn and amusing to play, esp. for an X-Men fan

I really enjoyed this expansion/standalone edition of Munchkin. I enjoy the Marvel ones better, but X-men is pretty cool. My only complaint is that there is no Apocalypse or Dark Phoenix villains. Perhaps in a later expansion?

I didn't like that you can only play with 3-4 players, still waiting for deadpool expansion.

Not as good as Munchkin Marvel. It is only 4 players, and it comes with less cards than Munchkin Marvel. It is missing key Allys such as Rogue, Gambit, Quicksilver, and Nightcrawler. The game is still fun to play. I think they underachieved with this one.

Got this to mix in with my Marvel Munchkin set. It's pretty much your typical standalone Munchkin game, which is to say that it's pretty similar to the rest with a different theme slapped on it. I like having the character sheets with different powers and level trackers though, which helps to make the game easier to track.

Munchkin X-Men combined with Munchkin Marvel works seamlessly well [although I suppose you can make the same argument for all Munchkin games...this combo is just awesome].

I have two complaints with this edition.  (1) Not enough monsters.  It is very easy to buff yourself up very quickly and make winning the combats too easy.  (2) Only a 3-4 player game.  Most other Munchkin games are 3-6.  Larger parties make it less likely anyone will team up.

If they fix these two things for me with some expansions I will raise my view of the game.

Usually I'd chalk this up to "find your theme/flavor" [game], but through three 3-player playthroughs I found this to be very unbalanced compared to the original- clearly a matter of capitalizing on the brand/their success and not at all well play-tested.

Positives: love the idea of character cards with different abilities.  Some of the new card interactions can be super fun. Love the idea of cards with interactions based on RL features of the players/room.

Negatives: There's a clear best and second best player card. Luck seems to be a bigger factor than in the original. Games can drag out long past the fun peak.

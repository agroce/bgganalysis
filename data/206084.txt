You will need to incorporate a couple of expansions at the same time to make it more challenging. With 5 expansions and the different difficulty boards included, this game does have good replay value. I would say it is on par with Onirim but this game requires no shuffling!

In Nautiluon, you take the helm of a Nautilion submarine and recruit a heroic crew on a journey through the oceanic depths. You must get to the Abyss before the Phantom Submarine reaches your homeland, the Happy Isles.  Each turn, you roll three dice and give one to each of these figures: the Nautilion, the Phantom Submarine, and the Darkhouse. The dice of the Nautilion and the Phantom Submarine move those figures along a path formed by Crew tokens: the Nautilion from the Happy Isles towards the Abyss; the Phantom Submarine in the opposite direction. The crew token on which your Nautilion ends its move joins your submarine, the one the Phantom Submarine reaches is lost!  The evil Darkhouse presents challenges to overcome or endure during you journey.

Way too simple and boring. I have really enjoyed some of the Oniverse games but this was a total miss for me. I think this series has lost its must-buy status in my mind almost entirely because of this game.

RATING: 6
Actually, a great little game. Again!!
I only played this game about 5 times but I really like it. 
You got to use at least one of the included expansions for a more enjoyable game, though.

You will pretty quickly figure out what strategy works. Once you do, you will almost always win. Adding more expansions will make it harder so I would suggest to get your head wrapped around the basic strategy and than add one expansion after another quickly e.g. add an expansion play 2-3 games, add another expansion etc.

I prefer playing this game as Solitaire but it does work really well in Co-op mode with another player.

Great game. Get it if you like solo games or simple and quick co-ops.

Did I mention the Quality ? It's absolute fantastic. It's on par if not a tiny bit better than Castelion quality wise.

Initial Impression: Similar to the rest of the series, the artwork in this game conveys a sense of surrealism. Unfortunately, with the limited number of components in the game, your exposure to varied artwork is minimal, which makes me feel less immersed in the theme. Of all the Oniverse games I've owned/played, this one feels the lightest. Setup is fairly simple and quick. The gameplay decisions don't feel quite as tense as previous games in the series. Of course, I've only played the base game so far and I'm sure that the expansions will increase the difficulty. Overall, this feels like a good inclusion to the Oniverse universe that I'm sure to warm up to with repeated plays.

This is a fun solo experience. I truly enjoy dice manipulation mechanics and although that part is very light in this game, it's enough to be fun and allow for at least a little bit of decision making in a sea of luck driven gameplay. The game is very quick and takes up very little space.

The heroic feats and the darkhouse expansions with the donut sub are when the decisions become agonizing. 

The first three expansions provide utility and character to your crew members. The challenges are increased, and in the reefs and the mages, the benefits pay off. The mercenaries provides a different way to lose, adding tension to the mid game and creating a first act.

The game sets up and plays quickly, all in about 15 minutes. My favourite of the Oniverse.

Solo game. Dice and roll with dice management possibilities.
Never tried the 2-played co-op variant and don't intend to. 

Cons:
The set-up might be a little bit fiddly.
Dice are a bit small.
Not sure for the sleeved card space but not enough cards/shuffling to *need* sleeving.

Pros: 
Several exp. included in game.
Lot of variety in one box.
Challenging enough.
Stunning packaging, like all its Oniverse sibblings.

Oniverse: It was the one I was more curious to try and wanted to play more at first, but I don't play that much often. Either I lost interest or I simply have too much choice. MIGHT be the closest to the bottom of the list, even tho I really enjoy it.

The game works at many levels. As a simple solitaire puzzle for casual gamers, up to a meaty probability look-ahead complex experience for gamers, if one adds all the expansions. It is elegant, flows well, and has meat on the bones. However, for some reason Nautilion simply failed to excite me in the same way that all previous games of the series have. I feel this boils down to lack of innovation, nothing in Nautilion seems novel and exciting in the way that Onirim, or Castellion, or even Urbion did. Still, this is a fun game and a gorgeous production.

It's simple, it's quick, and it's probably not deep enough to take the crown from Onirim.  Still, with the 'cards' expansion you get some challenging and variable situations.  The Mages and the Mercenaries expansions didn't add a whole lot of interesting choices, and I'm concerned that they (esp. Mercenaries) makes the game a little too luck dependent.  

Even without expansions, it's still a fun little challenge of how to effectively place your three dice.

Might be a little too easy, but again you can up the difficulty with expansions and such.

Played this a few times. It was okay, but nowhere near as good as the other three Oniverse games. I really like the submarine theme and the different variant Nautilion ships. The game offers a lot of customization to make it as hard or easy as you want.

Unfortunately, the moment to moment gameplay isn't as fun as Shadi hoped it would be. Rolling three dice and then assigning them works fine, but it's nowhere near as interesting as the other entries in the series. That's my biggest criticism of the game: given the choice, I'd rather play one of Shadi's other games almost every time.

Nautilion is the fourth game in the Oniverse series and certainly shares its DNA with Onirim, Sylvion, and Castellion. Shadi Torbey is a master at creating tense, puzzle-ly games packed with juicy decisions.

I enjoy experiencing the Oniverse games by immersing myself in their world, solely playing one of these solo games for an extended period, leaving it set up the table and playing it at every opportunity, working my way through the expansions. Nautilion as well, I think, rewards this approach.

The “expansions” in Nautilion serve to introduce one to the full game experience, step-by-step, and perhaps “expansion” is misleading to some. This approach was done with Castellion, where there are clear training levels that prepare one for the full game. This in contrast to Onirim, where the many expansions can stand on their own.

I think that Nautilion truly shines with all expansions included and I don’t think I’d ever go back. Expansion 5: Heroic Actions could be renamed Heroic Feats (or Challenges), because sometimes it’s a real mind-bender to figure out how to satisfy one: for example Heroic Action 10!

There are many knobs to turn to adjust the difficulty: different submarines, reserve tokens, Darkhouse Action cards.

With all the expansions included, many of my games have come down to the last turn, with often me losing. Games are tight! One miraculous win happened when I took advantage of Darkhouse Action 6 to take the Phantom’s token, which I needed and was the last token before the Happy Isles, and then moved into the Abyss for the win.

Nautilion seems like a game of Onirim with all the cards laid out on the table. At first, I found this overwhelming and had to adjust to focus my decisions. It’s a challenge to get the dice to cooperate! I think Nautilion is a truly interesting roll-and-move game.

I had previously given Castellion a 10, Onirim a 9, and Sylvion an 8. I now give Nautlion a 9, placing it on par with Onirim. Time will tell if it nudges up or down (but hey, it is a submarine!).

This is the die rolling oniverse game and its really simple mechanically and quite good fun. There are not so many difficult decisions as the previous games, but then I have only played this on the very easiest difficulty so far and as usual there are plenty of modules and extras to adjust the difficult and complexity to your liking.
I won both games easily but I did have terrible lucky dice rolls all the way through. I would like to give this a go 2 player to see how the back and forth works

Shadi Torbey games are still an auto-buy for me and I have to say I'm pleased with Nautilion as I am with any of his designs.  While Torbey's games always have a "racing" feel to them, this is truly made the theme of this game as two ships vie for each other's domain in a race to see whether good or evil gets to their destination first.  This is the first Torbey game to introduce dice, and they are used perfectly fine here, though you may feel lady luck is screwing you more here than in his previous games (though luck always plays a part in anything he designs).  A great wealth of expansions are included to add more strategic options (while upping the difficulty with every bone you are thrown!)  Tightly designed, Nautilion is always a game that comes down to the wire.  Equal luck and good decision making is needed.  Not as deep as Sylvion or as puzzly as Castellion, but Nautilion is a game equal in its own right and the powerhouse combo of Torbey and illustrator Elise Plessis still continue to enchant me.  Each included expansion adds a neat twist that serves the game well.  Out of the hundreds of games that I own, this is the only "gamer's game" I have that uses roll-and-move mechanics.  I appreciate Torbey taking on such a verboten mechanism in modern games and trying to do something enjoyable with it.  Excellent work, Shadi!

Nautilion is  a simple roll and move game with enough expansions and tricks to make it interesting.  Like all Oniverse games, it is tested and polished enough to play well without house rules and reworks.  For a fairly abstract mini Euro game, it has enough flavor and fun to grab the first time gamer.  It has enough substance to keep the more experienced gamer interested for a few plays.  It is a pretty quick game, taking closer to 15  minutes than 30.  It's a fun little quick fix when you want to play a game but only have a little bit of time.

RATING: 5
Nautilion, as the fourth game in Torbey's Oniverse 2.0, is a good inclusion that lives up to the pedigree.

In short, Nautilion is a dice management game with, as per usual to Oniverse, a slew of abilities (which come through expansions) which often come to also add complications too! For example, the mercenaries can fill any space in your submarine and are required to not lose the game mid-way, but also prevent you from filling those spaces with the actual crew you eventually need when you reach your final destination; the heroic actions cost you a crew member each (*and* you need to use *all* of the heroic actions!).  

The core mechanic is simple, yet effective: 1) roll three dice and allocate them to your sub, the enemy ship, and the lighthouse (which is a "failsafe" that potentially cost you resources that can go towards re-rolling dice); 2) move the two ships. The enemy ship takes out valuable tokens along the way, you pick them up if you are able to place them in your sub (depending on its shape which gives variable difficulty adjacency rules). You need to get to your destination before your opponent, and have a full crew (and a few extra critters if you play with expansions).

The base game is pretty staightforward; I jumped into expansion material quickly. I appreciate how they always seem to make obvious choices not so obvious!

Pretty impressed with this one. All the extra expansions can leave you feeling a little AP when deciding how you want to play, but the core game has a fun and unique mechanic. I like the challenge of choosing what to do with the roll you're given. Has a nice race element that makes the pacing excellent.

The added challenge of the 2 player made is definitely a must those looking for a little more bite.

Just played once. The game is harder than I thought. As the game progresses, you will go throught the track faster, as well as your 'opponent'. And you need to watch which crew memebers are already taken and how many are still on the track that you can reach.

Played a few times more: I like how you can make the game harder and easier (more or less reserve tokens, other submarine and expansions). 

The game is about collecting numbers (= crew) in a certain way before the timer (= phantom) runs out. There is a bit of chance with the 3 dice and the random setup, but you can mitigate that if you have enough tokens in reserve, so I think luck will play a minor roll. The greatest part luck will play is perhaps in the ease of winning, not whether you win or lose.

I like the game ( I love the artwork and the story and it's playable solo, so that's a plus), I don't know yet why I exactly like it, but that will come with more plays.

The best metaphor I can think of for Nautilion is that of learning to drive on a farm.  Your dad takes you out into a muddy field, puts you in the seat and says "drive, kid".  You grip the wheel and stomp the gas hard in the open field, going as fast as you dare with little to slow you down other than your own nerves.  It's a thrill because its new, but soon you learn that driving itself is just a verb and the thrill was the new.  However, One day following a storm in the back forty you take a turn in your comfortable third gear, and suddenly even though you are at the wheel you are no longer driving.  You see a tree down in the road, and a wash on the bend.  Your wheels feels different in the mud and the full load in the truck shifts and the truck starts to have a mind of its own and for a few white knuckle moments you aren't driving.  You are on an adventure.  Thats when you realize that the adventure of driving isn't about the verb, its about the road.  

Driving the truck is the easy part.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I only got in a few plays since I still haven't managed to find time for solo gaming. However; my initial impressions are quite high which isn't very surprising since I also enjoy Onirim and Sylvion. The most impressive feat is taking roll and move and building a whole game around that one mechanism. So far I have tried the first expansion which definitely adds a lot to the game. Looking at the remaining expansions it seems as if the difficulty will continue to ratchet up. The artwork is amazing as always, although Sylvion is still my favorite in that regard. 

I'm looking forward to more plays and forming a better, overall opinion. Right now Nautilion may hold a slight edge over both Onirim and Sylvion because it is much easier to set up and play and there isn't any shuffling involved. If you are a fan of the Omniverse games I definitely think Nautilion is worth getting. If you are looking to get a solo game I'd recommend any of the Omniverse games, but more specifically either this or Sylvion.[/i]

Having a bunch of different modes to play, and different objectives within each mode, provides a ton of replayability. Which is a must-have in the solo/2-player niche. And the game flows quickly as well. A nice addition to the genre.

A game that actually makes roll and move fun.  Reminds me a bit of That's Life!  but isn't too similar but both have a good use of roll and move.  There are interesting decisions and it can be difficult to win.  Quick easy to set up and has a wide variety of options to play with to keep it fresh.  Might end up being my favorite of the Omniverse game.

I haven't played the expansions yet, but so far I have enjoyed it every time I played it. Love the artwork, good components, and it only takes 15-20 min to set up and play. Luck is there but still you have to made some decisions and foresee which posibilities you can have in future turns. Can't compare with the rest of the games from the oniverse because I haven't tried them yet, but this one is quite good!

A neat solo game full of touch choices without too much randomness.  Well done!  Once you add in all the mini-expansions, there are lots of factors to consider about how to allocate your dice and when to reroll.  The custom dice (1,1,2,2,3,4) are well designed to provide some uncertainty but not too much variance.

I find that the omniverse games are hit or miss.  Some are far too simplistic and random while others are superb.  This is one of the superb ones.

I'm a fan of clever takes on roll and move games, and this is a good one. Roll 3 dice, and assign 1 die to your movement, 1 die to enemy movement, and 1 die to 'the darkhouse', which can hurt you if you give it the high numbers. The base game seems slightly too light, but thankfully there are expansions included to give you more to consider and make things more challenging. A fun puzzle with simple mechanics.

The artwork is whimsical and fantastic. Gameplay is not complex yet interesting. But mostly I love it because my not-really-a-gamer wife loves to play and often suggests playing over breakfast.

My least favourite of the Oniverse series. I found it too easy (even with other submarines), long setup time for shorter play time. Still enjoyable though.

Just got this at Half Price Books. The only game in the series I have or have had a chance to play. I have heard good things about this and Onirim, especially for solo play so will give it a shot. Decent puzzle game. Game came with some expansions I will have to try.

Another great entry in the Omniverse. This time with dice assignment and a press your luck timing mechanism. Played the base game with the first expansion (mages) 2x and lost but it was close.

Picked this one up on a whim... I enjoy Onirim, and love solo games...

I was not disappointed. I hope people can look past the "roll and move" mechanic, because this game has much more decision making that it initially shows. Adding in the "expansions" only deepens the game play. 

Great game... Personally... I like it better than Onirim. The main quibble I have with Onirim is the constant shuffling, this game has almost no down time.

All in all, Excellent addition to the Oniverse!

[thing=206084][/thing] is the newest game in the Oniverse (following Onirim, Urbion, Sylvion and Castellion). This one is a roll and move mixed with set collection, as the ship Nautilion needs to reach the enemy, Darkhouse, with a full crew of 9 different beings in order to defeat it, and must do this before the Phantom Submarine reaches the Happy Isles.

The rules are easy: in the turn you roll 3 dice, and must allocate one for the Darkhouse (if the number is a 3 or 4, the player loses one token - from the extras, or from the crew); one for the Phantom Submarine, and it moves the number of spaces indicated in the die, removing the token it lands on; and one for the Nautilion, who moves the spaces and take for its crew the token it lands on. The first crew is open to be put in the space is belongs (the places in the ship are numbered from 1 to 9), however the next ones must follow the pipes, which can only be placed in a spot connected by a pipe to a space already containing a crew member. If the crew token can't be placed in the Nautilion (or the player doesn't want to), the token is placed facedown and can be used to re-roll dice, to change tokens from one place to another or to change a die to a value the player wants - the player, in normal difficulty, starts with 4 tokens able to to this. That is is for the base game.

The game also comes with 5 expansions, which are:
- [b]Mage's Cabin[/b]: the weakest one, but does serve as a buffer, in order to manage the difficulty increase that later expansions bring, as it adds more tokens for the Phatom Submarine to grab, without costing the game, while also providing ways for the player be able to have a better control of the results of the dice;
- [b]Mercenaries[/b]: very good, as it adds difficulty and much more thought to the use of dice and timming to the movement of the ships;
- [b]Reefs[/b]: is OK, and it adds set up time. Increases difficulty, but at the expanse of luck - if the player is stuck in a Reef, she rolls a die and must roll 3 or more in order to escape, otherwise the Nautilion loses a turn of movement (but takes the Reef token as an extra token that can be used to re-roll, etc);
- [b]Darkhouse cards[/b]: very good. Can greatly increases difficulty (using 5 red cards), or be more lenient using 3 red and 2 blue;
- [b]Heroic actions[/b]: OK. Though at first I thought these would make the game easier, my experience showed me otherwise, as I often struggle to fulfill them, while also having to deal with the Collision (from the Mercenaries), the Darkhouse and Reefs. Still, some of the cards are of much more use than others, meaning the ratio of difficulty can vary a lot.

The quality for the graphic design and art continues to be superb, maintaining the mood of the Oniverse and the over-production of the series we all know and love by know (for instance, the game comes with stands for all the different types of ships, though only one would suffice). Top notch stuff.

The replay value is really high: not only the path for the Nautilon is random, but alongside the several expansions, which also add more variety, the game comes with different types of ships to represent the Nautilion - one type A, two type B and three type C - all of them with an unique layout, making easier (A) or much harder (C) to place crew members. Though the overall feels remains the same - as the mission still is going from point A to B with a full crew before the enemy reaches your base -, the difficulties, decisions and timming will change a lot.

In the end, [thing=206084][/thing] is another good addition to the Oniverse. It is quite different from its brothers. Though it leans, on normal play, to the easy side, there are plenty of ways to bring more challenge to the mission. Gameplay is smooth and usually ends in around 20 minutes, using every moment of it. Is gorgeous, portable and offers a fine amout of decisions (mostly not hard), going both for timely opportunities and planning for the distance. [thing=206084][/thing] is easy-going, still having some depth.

Overall, [thing=206084][/thing] isn't as good as Sylvion, being, for me, in the same level as Onirim and Castellion, and definitely above Urbion. Recommended.

Right from the start Nautilion presents six different vessels that provide unique experiences and more difficult challenges even without digging into the five expansions.  The artistic direction with the different submarines and their anthropomorphic crews is fun and so is the thought provoking twist to the roll and move mechanic that creates mind engaging gameplay.  There is alot of immersive game play in this small Oniverse boxe.  This is one to have for a broader audience, and the most accessible to a co-op experience with a non-gamer loved one.

Very solid and fun solitaire game. I will definitely recommend to play with one or more of the expansions, as it  raises the 'fun-O-meter' of this game to a whole new level.

Another fine addition to the Oniverse. Fun puzzle games with lovely art and increasing levels of difficulty. The dice mechanism worked well for the first playthrough and I look forward to trying it with different Nautilions and the expansions.

The more I play this game the more fun it becomes. There are so many ways to make the game more challenging and enjoyable by playing with the expansions. Plus the fact that you can play with a different ship and a different game board almost insures that you will never play the same game twice. Well done!

I think that the base game without expansions is horribly bland, but that seems to be run of the mill for most Oniverse titles. With all five expansions added in this becomes a very fun game. Sadly I find that the rules could be better clarified in a couple of places, but until then I'll play the way I think is in the spirit of the rules.

GAME: Blue Moon
RANK: 862

RATING: 9
Blue Moon seems to hit a sweet spot in my personal tastes: play after play, the game grows along with your proficiency with each deck, stretching the boundaries of a truly simple system and revealing unexpected and subtle complexities. As many others have already pointed out, it shares a good deal of Magic's charm (the different decks with distinctive gameplay and, of course, the deck building options, clearly to a much more limited extent) without the added weight of a CCG's first and often feared C. But, at least to me, the base game is already a great one: two decks of 30 cards, short playing time, well balanced and greatly themed, great replay value. Eventually, it's expandable, to the extent you prefer and without endangering its balance.

The oversized cards are really nice to see on the table, with the artwork ranging from good to great. The card quality could be much better, considering the lack of suitable card sleeves.

Can't make my mind up about this. On the one hand, I want to like it but if you like this type of thing, why not just do it properly and play a CCG. Need to play more before I have a real opinion

Awesome game to satisfy the collectors impulse without the danger of self-destruction and guilt of spending hundreds of dollars (nope, just the guilt of spending about $105). Reminds me very much of Condotierre, only for two players.

Vulca Deck = 6
I've never been a fan of playing vanilla. Even if it's on fire.

Hoax = 7
Nothing really amazing theme wise going on with this deck. Just a solid tricky deck.

After playing some other card games for a while, including casual play of Magic: The Gathering, I picked up the Buka Invasion deck because it was on sale and now I'm all excited to play Blue Moon again. This is a game that I never seem to get tired of. For a while I had downrated Blue Moon because it was less complex than CCGs, but now I see why Knizia elminated some CCG elements like land cards and matchups between individual creatures. The heart of a dueling card game is finding interesting card combos to whack your opponent with. Blue Moon lets you focus on that creativity without a lot of extra weight in the game.

RATING: 9
After playing for several months, I feel I can now honestly rate it. My first play or two or three and I thought that the game was alright as I loved the card art and the little plastic dragons.  It's unfortunate that the board is poorly done and should have included an icon listing *with explanations* (I found a nice one on the bgeek and taped two copies onto the board). 

It was after 4 or 5 plays that I really started to feel the depth of the game's card play. In this game (like a lot of CCG's) "knowing your deck" (strengths and weaknesses) is very important. The game is more strategic than I first thought as I initially played it very tactically from hand to hand. But once all the possibilities started to unfold, I really began to enjoy the game. There's a luck factor that almost any card game has but a skilled player will know how to manage that as best as they can and can still come out a winner. 

I ended up buying about 4 more decks (Mimix, Terrah, Aqua, and Allies) after a few plays and I'm very glad for it. This is a game that I will go back to over the years with gaming joy.

RATING: 8
Really nice, quick, two player card game.  Have had an interest in CCGs for some time, but have never wanted to spend the time and money required to really play these games.  Blue Moon seems to capture the feel and game play (on a smaller scale) without the afore mentioned problems.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Meh. It looked good, but I'm not excited about the feel of the game. It feels like a bidding game, dressed up as a muscle flexing contest (try to impress the dragons!). By "looked good", I don't mean that I really enjoyed the artwork. Maybe it is the ugliness of the Vulca and Hoax guys, but I think the art doesn't look very cool, and all the cards for each side look too similar for the art to be pratically useful. Also, I think I would be too embarrassed by the over-the-top-rediculous art to try to play this with friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There's a lot going on here, and it's certainly not easy to figure out, that's for sure. It's an interesting game, though I'm thinking that the two included races are teasers mainly. Everything I'm seeing suggests that the expansions are what make this one work. We'll see.

After having stopped playing Magic:TG I was really  interested in something similar, just without the endless buying of a CCG. I think the system of blue moon is really fair and I appreciate that, but somehow the gameplay cannot stand up to M:TG. It is to indirect for my taste but I am not really experience in Blue Moon.

I enjoyed this much more than I thought I would. It offers the same cool factor of a CCG without being a crappy CCG. The mechanics are so simple, but provide a nice bit of tension and allow for interesting combos. I'm curious to know how the different decks play. I recommend this for two people looking to get deep into a game with many repeated plays.

RATING: 7
While I have a hard copy and several expansion decks, I have only played this on the computer. And the computer usually whops my hide. Eventually, after learning some card combos, the computer can be occasionally beaten.

My wife has seen the coulouful cards and has expressed some interest inlearning the game, so kudo to it, for that.

Very colourful, and easier for me than my woeful attempt at Race for the Galaxy (which I also intend to conquer - yeah, right).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Basic system is simple and not too original. But many different cards, expansions with different peoples make it more interesting.
Also: Lovely cards design with flavour texts.

If you have only the basic game, my rating is only a 5.5. The game will soon get a bit boring a after a few plays.
If you have 4 or more peoples wto choose from, it gets much more interesting, as you have to find out a good strategy for each combination of peoples, so the rating goes up to a 7.5 then.

RATING: 10
Even with just the base set, Blue Moon is a blast.  More than any other game in my collection, this game has approachability.  It's easy to learn, easy to teach, fairly short to play and very repeatable.  

The art on the cards is outstanding, the cards are big (tarot sized) and durable.  The theme really comes through, and the different decks have distinct personalities in game play, graphic design, and theme.

Blue Moon is one of my favorite 2 player games.  The fact that you can expand it with different decks definitely switches things up, and the deck building rules help with that as well.  It's one of my go-to games for gamers, kids, and non-gamers alike.

RATING: 7.5
+ Surprisingly deep card playing; Each faction really does play differently in a meaningful way.
- So many good 2 player games to choose from!


Why it's previously-owned:
With a game like this, you have to have exactly one other person who is really invested into learning the game, its nuances, and wants to explore the different available decks.  I didn't really find that one other person.  
I traded this for Incan Gold (quite possibly my worst trade ever).  Even still, when we're looking for a 2 player card game, there's no shortage of selections.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I am not particularly fond of card games, but I simply love this game. There are so many challenges and options that each play of this game is fun and exciting. These options not only vary from deck to deck that one is playing but also from deck to deck that one is playing against. It takes a little time to learn how the different cards can be used to advantage but in the end the game is pure joy!

RATING: 5
1st play: I'm not sure if my first play was an anomaly or if it's just how this game goes. Each turn felt really random and arbitrary as to whether I'd have the most strength or not. Perhaps with more plays and getting to the know the deck better, but there are so many points of just random "does he have it or doesn't he" moments.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an absorbing game, which opens up the more you explore it (the negative side of that being that it takes a while to know enough about each side to play effectively).  Problems occasionally loom (is it just a climbing game?  Are the decks really at all balanced?) but a bit more experience makes then suddenly vanish or transmute.  As a result, the game comes across as a minor miracle of balanced design.  By the way, both this and Race for the Galaxy were purchases prompted by Keldon Jones's excellent AIs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
(I had a long comment here that seems to have been eaten by the database.)

Brilliant, much more than you might think when you first encounter the climbing mechanic.  Knowing the opposing deck + both players being cluey about retreating and closing down a game with discards = a tense masterpiece.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A light card game for 2 persons. Some cards are very powerful compared to other cards, which can be frustrating if you're stuck with nothing but weak ones. But since you go through all of your deck, in the end you will have had as many powerful cards as your opponent had, so it balances out just fine.

Gameplay (smooth play/player interaction/strategy&tactics/depth)

RATING: 10
[Complete, with all people decks, both Emissaries & Inquisitors]

Rating not so much the core decks as the idea and rule system here -- the expansions definitely seem more fun, but this is more the "overall" rating of Blue Moon with a few expansions, in which case it's a quick, fun, not-pure-luck (there's plenty of strategy if you want it) but lots of excitement/luck card game.  

More importantly, we sure want to play this a lot, which is the best testament to it being pretty good.  A game that offers decent substance and high variability, in a short time frame, is going to get played many, many times, and generally make life better.  Blue Moon turns out to be that kind of game, perhaps more than any other we own.

UPDATE:  Down a hair.  Not that it's not great, I'm just slightly burned-out on the deck pairs that work well to play, and had a few sour games.  The Emissaries and Inquisitors additions are "meh."

UPDATE:  Back up, it's unreasonable to let Inquisitors take it down.

RATING: 5
Blue Moon has fantastic artwork, oversized cards that are easy to hold, and sturdy plastic dragons (very cool!) that are stored in a fitted Kosmos 2-player box. I find Blue Moon to be simple to learn and easy to play. I particularly like the game end trigger because it means that the games don't drag on: if one player gets all three dragons or the draw deck is exhausted, then all available cards are simply played out. I really appreciate the fact that the card decks are "pre-built" and non-collectible. The playing field is more balanced that way, since each deck is designed to be competitive. I used to play Magic: The Gathering, but it takes a lot of time and money for it to be worth it, especially if you play with people that are crazy for it. My friends had highly customized decks already, so I was at a bit of a disadvantage with my base deck and a few boosters.

UPDATE 1: The plastic dragon alone makes this one attractive, as well as the mechanic it brings. I waver on this one, but wavering towards the keep. UPDATE 2: Yeah, the plastic dragons and the card mat are really the only things I like - I'd rather play something else. The artwork is okay, the two races are uninspiring. My husband and sister are less than impressed. Like the classic card game War with slight variations.

RATING: 10
Absolutely the best "pseudo-collectable" game yet. Far superior to Scarab Lords. There are now four ways to play: Standard: Using the preconstucted decks. Great balance. Advanced: Deck building. Decks still "based" on one people for theme. Best rule: No duplicates in deck. Emisarries: Enhanced without deck building.  33 different decks. Inquisitors: Enhanced deck building.

{two plays} It took us a while to get all the rules right, but I think we finally did... and I kind of warmed up to this one at the end.  I'd be interested to try other decks, but not interested enough to buy them (or the basic game, for that matter).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm still riding backlash against my middle school MtG addiction, and I'm a huge proponent of non-collectible card games as a result. I think people who like this game vastly overstate its "tactical complexity", but Blue Moon is still great as far as Magic-ish NCCGs go, and it's a work of art to boot. Nonetheless, I can't justify giving it a higher rating for two reasons:

1) It takes a number of games to "learn" how each deck plays and to get a good grasp on how the game works in general, so it's tough to bring non-gamers into the fold.

2) The base game is decidely stacked in favor of the Hoax once both players have a good grasp on how to play the game.

I'm on the fence about the expansions... I've seen the cards, thanks to the Blue Moon AI program, and they look really neat, but they'd be useless unless I can find somebody else to play with.

A well executed game that makes it well worthwhile to pick up the expansion decks.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

Excellent game.  I've since purchased all the extra decks and still loving it.  In a way, Blue Moon could be spoiling me.  Having one game with so much variety *and* balance is making me see how little replayability so many of the other games have.
CCGs aren't an option due to balance issues and card availability/cost etc.

Update: Just have not had a chance to play with so many other games around.  It's not something you can put down for any period as you lose touch with the various card abilities.  Will get back into this I hope.

It's a good card game for 2 players and is very balanced. Excellent illustrations on the cards. An 7.5 with the expansion decks, a 7 without them. The base game offers little variety - you can only play the Hoax deck or the Vulca deck - and it gets boring after awhile.

Egész jó kártyajáték! A két játékosnak van 1-1 paklija, ezek küzdenek egymással. Könnyen megtanulható, szép, pörgős, viszont nyelvfüggő.

Azóta kipróbáltam pár pakliépítős játékot, ezek fényében se rossz a Blue Moon!
---
Na szép lassan kipróbálgatom a fajokat. Továbbra is tetszik a játék. Nem a világ legjobbja, Summoner pl. jobb, de szívesen leülök hozzá, mert 1 perc előszedni, rövid egy parti, ha nincs időnk, akár 1 menet után is abba lehet hagyni. A kiegekkel együtt megvan a korlátlan újrajátszhatóság érzete is, és ahogy így egyben bebugyizva előkerülnek, jó ránézni a kártyákra, igényes, szép, és külön plusz pont az egyértelmű kapcsolatért a Blue Moon Cityvel, amit előbb ismertem meg és nagyon szeretem (ugyanaz a 8 faj van mindkét játékban, grafika is nagyon hasonló, és hát a 3 sárkány...). Kár, hogy a sárkányok színe csak néhány spec. kártyánál számít.
Az új jubileumi kiadásban egy dobozban lesz minden, szerintem megéri a játék az újraélesztést, gondolom egy kicsit újra divatba jön...

I was liking it more at first (or maybe I was just thinking that I like it lured by its great arts and a promise that it will replace my sentiment to MtG. In the end I think it's too simple and plays on almost autopilot with no real choices. I may keep it because of its presentation and the fact that I like games with assymetrical powers but it's nothing special. On the other hand I've only played with the 2 factions from the base game, maybe expansion factions will bring my interest back.

This is another simple, elegant and clever card game designed by Knizia. I think it's deceptively simple, as it seems quite deep... Nevertheless, it probably needs the full set of decks, as while as the whole deckbuilding process, to be fully appreciated by the CCG player in me...

I find myself wanting to pull this out after playing a wargame.  Lots of variety with the different races and some battles have been pretty heated.  It seems to me that some of the decks are better than others, I'm going to attempt to keep records of my plays to see if I can make any sense of it.

So far pretty decent.  I have four decks, Hoax, Vulca, Flit and Terrah.  They seem a little unbalanced at this point, but I am certain it is more due to my inexperience than anything else.  I look forward to acquiring more decks and attempting to try the Draft method.  Never played a CCG, so wasn't sure what to expect.  Enjoyable.

I can't get into Blue Moon.  It seems like the results are always random, depending on who drew the better cards.  I felt like the rules were incomplete, but maybe I was misinterpreting them.  There were a lot of card interactions where I couldn't figure out which card trumped the other.  Also, I found all the non-Terrah art extremely cheesy.

[i]Posted: 3/10/08, Rated: 8[/i]

I really enjoyed playing the collectible card game (CCG) [i][thing=463]Magic: The Gathering[/thing][/i] until I realized that in order to be truly competitive, I was going to have to spend a lot of money buying special cards.  I was resentful of that fact, and ultimately lost interest in playing it.  Although I haven't played a game in years, I still have fond memories of its highlights, chief among those being the process of building a deck.

The idea of a game which was CCG-like [i]without[/i] being a money pit like [i][thing=463]Magic: The Gathering[/thing][/i] was quite appealing.  I felt disoriented during my first few games of [i]Blue Moon:[/i] the game presents a different world, with its own unique mechanics.  Once I began to understand how it worked I realized that there was a beautfiully strategic battle to be fought.

There is no concept of "damaging" the other player's hit points.  Instead, you are trying to beat the other player's deck.  This is an important distinction, because losing a game doesn't feel as personal.  You can try for a fast win by overwhelming your opponent's ability to match your attack strength.  Alternatively, you can try to grind out a win over long rounds where more cards and special powers come into play.

The base game comes with two "races."  The "Vulca" are fiery creatures  who can quickly blaze to victory.  The "Hoax" are about deck control, and can neutralize that big offense.  These decks are not one-dimensional, as they actually have a few cards from other races as well.  This one matchup alone is excellent.

When you're ready for some more variety then there are expansions.  Unlike a true CCG, these expansions are also fixed-decks, which means you will get the same set of cards each time.  This is the feature which I love: I can spend a relatively small amount of money (the equivalent of two or three booster packs from a "traditional" CCG), and know in advance exactly which cards I'm going to get.  Since one of the rules for building a deck is that every card must be different, it is not useful to buy a second copy of any of them.

[i]Blue Moon[/i] is a well-conceived game that plays quickly, and with a lot of excitement.  It definitely scratches that CCG itch, without inflicting the pain of a true CCG.  If you're looking for that type of game experience, then give [i]Blue Moon[/i] a try.

Nice 2 player game that doesn't take too long. We used to play this more than we do now. I think it's because each deck has a certain way of playing that works best. As opposed to something like Race for the Galaxy where you need to figure out a strategy after you start. Fun game though.

That cards are able to convey their story and bring you into the universe without the CCG format is remarkable. if you get a chance obtain this, you will not be sorry.

ConstructableCardGame, MultiOnly

A CCG-like game that is actually balanced but allows for limited deck-building (and now allows for much more expansive deck-building with the Inquisitors), and almost all decks seem equally interesting, though they fit different tastes.  A gem with a lot of replay value.
  
I keep this game around because it really does sum up a lot of CCG mechanics all in one package; the limited number of expansions keep it from being a money drain indefinitely---yet also give the game enough variety to yield a lot of replay value; the game is very, very balanced; and deck construction is really not a must, unless you truly want to, and even then it's not an all-consuming activity.

I have all the expansions, but am not about to mark each one as owned...

The careful balance of the Blue Moon decks is a beautiful thing to behold. This is a game of timing more than anything; of holding back, holding back, holding back, and then striking when your opponent is at their weakest (or are they holding back something stronger?); of knowing, as they say, when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em. The decks are small and packed like coiled springs, and increasing familiarity with the game will lead to ever-more closely fought battles. This is a game that will reward opponents prepared to put in multiple plays, not one to just pull off the shelf every once in a while.

There is a decent game in here you just don't get it when you buy the base box. Needs the expansions to remain interesting and I refuse to pay for them.

Update: Was able to buy a lot of the expansions for almost nothing. Have to play again to reevaluate.

Update: Started playing this with my 8 year old son. He liked it very much. Since the game felt fresh for me also I'll probably play this some more in the coming weeks. So let's see if the new decks will improve my rating.

Update: The new decks have certainly livened up the game. I'm liking this little tactical tug of war game more and more.

This is a game that a) I will play most anytime b) is not my favorite; I have no special love for it but c) Since it is easy to teach, enjoyable, and looks great, it is likely to get table time, therefore d) I will suggest and play this game more often than I would have expected. It's a good game, it just doesn't excite me. I guess that's because for all its elegance it does not tell a story. It's purely a puzzle, trying to maximize your outcomes based on your cards and position. Very good as games go, but essentially a pretty abstract. I think it's disappointing to me personally since it looks like it wants to tell an interesting, magical story and it just doesn't. I wish there was a book based on the Blue Moon world (in English).

I bet a fun thing would be to go way back in time to where there was going to be an eclipse and tell the cave men, "If I have come to destroy you, may the sun be blotted out from the sky." Just then the eclipse would start, and they'd probably try to kill you or something, but then you could explain about the rotation of the moon and all, and everyone would get a good laugh.

I really want to give this a 9, but it just needs to be a little deeper.  A valiant attempt at a limited CCG, Blue Moon combines the varied tactical handplay of MtG with less screwage and less dependence on monetary resources.

*OK.  I broke down and gave this a 9.  This game continues to receive regular play.  Also, my questions about depth have revealed themselves as false.  Playing against seasoned opponents ratchets up the tension, and fun, to a game standing tall next to MtG.  Of course, I cannot but cede that this is a game of incredible elegance, another example of Knizia genius.

After one play. Players build or play a pre-built deck of cards from a particular faction (Volca or Hoax) and engage one another in an abstracted war for the struggle of the Blue Moon realm. This is done by challenging your opponent to individual battles which, if won, earn you a dragon. Earn more dragons than the opponent for the win. The fun comes in building card combinations to force an opponent into quitting a fight. Also in managing your hand for future battles and knowing when to fight and when to retreat. Like all the great collectible card games, this offers player a lot of opportunity for strategic thought in composing decks and tactical thought in conducting individual battles. Also, a lot of great artwork can be found in the individual cards. They are a lot of fun to look through. There is also a lot of expandability to the system, but this is not a blind-draw money-pit: players with only the base set can play just as competively with others that own expansion material.

RATING: 5
Missing the fun.  The limitations on card play make this game painful.  At least with the basic set there was little chance to save cards between rounds to build a substantial attack force.  So much of the game was spent in a stalemate... with luck of the cards... until we ran out of cards and I won by having the right cards left.  I also don't like the fact that you need to win twice before moving a dragon to your side of the board (it gets stuck in the center or neutral ground)... this drags out the game even further.  I'd much rather play Battle Line or Schotten-Totten.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My rating is based on a few plays with the base set (Vulca/Hoax) a game of Aqua (me) vs. Pillar and a Flit (me) vs. Terrah. So far I like it, and I win as often as not, but I don't yet feel that I have a good understanding of the strategy of this game. I expect the rating to be adjusted (possibly up, possibly down) after more plays. If rating goes up, then I'll consider deckbuilding. If I can't get a better handle on some strategy, it might go down.

This is the first such card-combat game I've played (I've never played MtG, for instance, yes, I lived in a cave in the 90s, OK?), and I feel like I need to understand the cards much better than I do to play well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The one black mark against this game is that it can take a few plays before the tactics become clear (when to retreat, card combinations, etc). Both players need to get a good understanding of the best cards in their deck and what to avoid in the opponent's. The more I play the more I like it!
***UPDATE*** The recent release of an AI version has sparked my interest further. Makes for an always-on-hand opponent (and pretty solid too) which is exactly what this game needs.
***UPDATE*** This rating has taken a dive since I got into Magic the Gathering. Ignoring its collectible aspect MTG is more streamlined and the elegant combat mechanics are far easier to understand than the constant "do i retreat?" thoughts needed for good Blue Moon play.

Quite a clever 2 player card game. There is more strategy to it than it would seem after first plays. The downside is, the theme puts off lots of new players.

The different decks play well against each other and different tactics are needed with each combination of decks. Very elegant!

RATING: 8
This two player card game seems clearly inspired by "Magic:The Gathering" with which it has many similarities. Simple basic rules but with each card having the ability to modify what is going on. Knizia's version does away with "mana" and it looks at first like a very simple card matching game. But additional cards can influence the action greatly with Knizia's version of "global enchantments" (Leader and support cards) and "creature enchantments" (booster cards). The object is to "win" engagements in such a way as to "lure" three dragons to your side in Knizia's Blue Moon universe.

The base game consists of a playing board, three nicely sculpted dragon figs (the "objects" of the game), and two decks representing two of the races in Knizia's Blue Moon universe. Decks are also available for several other races along with a couple of sets of miscellaneous additional cards. The decks come "preconstructed" and are all well balanced against each other; however, there is an option for "deck building" which can be just as satisfying as the similar process in M:tG

There is a lot of the subtlety of M:tG here without the complexity. It is very much its own game despite the superficial similarities. It is nowhere near as "rich" as M:tG but plays well and has its own charm. Best of all - it is not a CCG!!! There are the inevitable expansions, all of which appear to be well balanced; and, after an initial flurry, it appears that what is now available will be all that is required.

The theme can strike one as a bit juvenile as is the tone of the language on the cards but the game has surprising depth once you get into it. I'm happy to play it but expect it will be my grand-children that will want to play rather than my more jaded game companions...

Only played with base set but it was a good time.  The game does not have much strategy in my opinion and a lot is based on luck of the draw.  Overall a decent, quick two player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Good game - works on a number of levels. You can just play the decks out of the boxes and they're quite balanced, but if you want more you can start customising the decks (deck building) - problem with that is ideally both players need access to all the cards which then makes it much more expensive. Other downside is the game is a bit over produced - boxed set could do without the board etc making it cheaper, or they could at least offer the original decks without the board for those wanting 2 sets. 
** Update, being playing this one quite frequently, and it goes up and up. With the release of Pillar and E&I the game is even better, increased my rating to a 9

After some more games I have to revise my opinion. The game is not as light as it seems in the beginning.

A great 30-minute head-to-head confrontation game that is my wife's favorite.  While it is not a CCG, the fact that there are several different decks (species) to play, gives the game variety but at the same time means (1) you will probably end up paying for more than just the base game and (2) you will probably end up playing more than one game because you and your partner will want to try multiple combinations of species.  

See my review for more details.

Although it hasn't been played in years (and has bad memories), I'm not ready to get rid of it.

Games go just the right length for me with the Emmisarries. I have acquired the Inquisitor decks and Buka to do some deck building eventually. I don't see playing the Buka as a stand alone deck - they are very different and powerful. Overall, there is a nice bit of strategy in card manangement. The Vulca base set have 3 or 4 age inapropriate cards which needed editing. The Aqua need similar work. The Mimix are out with the younger crowd.
I rate the Hoax and the Vulca the same as other decks for balance and strength of play.

I was pretty impressed with the simplicity of rules for a game that boasts so much strategy.  I only have the basic set (for now), and the first couple of games were strongly favored toward the Vulca.  Soon however, I started making some play with the Hoax that not only blocked the Vulca's moves, but actually won some battles.  Lookin forward to getting the expansions and making some custom decks.

Knizia meets Magic The Gathering. And the results are excellent. The gameplay is slim and quick, the game is well designed and quite deep (considering the "light card game" cathegory, of course). Art on the cards is generally good and the various people are quite balanced (you'll notice this the more you play the game). Better bought with at least 1/2 expansions.

Need to play this more before I can give a proper review, but on our first play we had a huge stalemate problem, where each of us kept passing a single dragon back and forth. We quit after about 45 minutes because it seemed like there was no end in sight. Is there such thing as a game that's too balanced? 

UPDATE: A dozen+ plays later, and I have grown to appreciate this game more. Turns out we initially got a rule wrong and the game does not drag on indefinitely (matches end when your decks run out). As it is, it's a nice, easy to play 1-v.-1 card combat game that doesn't suffer from major imbalances or the huge time investment of a deck-constructing game like MTG.

6 is my provisional rating. This will go up if it's more fun with repeat plays. One thing that I do like is that it's a very, very quick game. The theme doesn't do much for me though (which is weird, because I liked the theme in Blue Moon City -- though it was the tiles, and not the cards, that did it for me there).

RATING: 9
Wonderful game - an elegant simplicity in design - very smooth and easy to pick up, but with depths to explore. For those, like me, who could never be bothered studying for a masters in MtG timing rules.  I should have known better since it's a Knizia but I avoided it for a long time because of the artwork and 'storyline' - cod fantasy of the worst sort - but don't let that put you off.  Yet another manisfestation of Knizia's fascination with cards numbered 0-9.  And yet another example of how much variety he can extract from that basic infrstructure.

This game is amazing; Knizia works on a whole different plane that the rest of us. As a sometime game critic, this game mystifies me because I can't explain cleanly why it works. It's fun, it exciting, it sucks you in, but from an analyst's standpoint, the game is simple yet so amazingly subtle that the mechanisms defy easy explanation. But with or without explanation, it's a great game.

RATING: 8
A battle of wits, really, but I don't see the brilliance in it that others seem to see.  On the otherhand, I can understand how repeated plays, and some familiarity with the decks can heighten one's understanding and love.  I'm just not there yet, I guess.UPDATE: Having played this a few more times, I've become more acquainted with the decks.  Once you know how to combine the powers of the cards, play becomes more and more interesting as players try to outwit one another.  The more I play this, the more I appreciate the simple elegance that can lead to so many interesting moves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ok, so it's a little better than I initially thought, but the gameplay is still pretty lackluster; play cards until one person runs out of good cards and loses the battle, or drop out of the fight early if you think you're going to lose.

Overall, just a bit too CCGish for my tastes, as I've never enjoyed that genre.  It's still a good game I suppose, just not my cup of tea.

RATING: 5
Like a simplified magic.  Some strategy exists, or, at least some tactics.  Honestly, I'd probably have to play it several more times to get a good grasp of the game's depth, but I'm not sure if its something I could really "get into".

RATING: 10
A hybrid of Magic the Gathering and the battle system of Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage.

This captures the core essence of Hannibal's battles system.  In Hannibal you play cards and the opponent must match or retreat and more rounds of cards you play the greater the loss to attrition. 

Blue Moon you must match (or beat) your opponents card and when one retreats the victor gains victory points (dragons), and double victory points if the battle was six cards or more (sort of like attrition).

Since this is out of print, would be interesting if another publisher could republished as an warring ancient empires--like Rome, Carthage, Egypt and more.

Part of what I dub as the Knizia wargame trilogy--Blue Moon, Blue Moon City, Lord of The Rings:  The Confrontation.

This game reveals wider strategy and more specific tactics after every play.

It is much better and more fun than I would have expected.

I suppose this could be considered Magic the Gathering lite.  If you play the premade decks, it seems to become played out quickly.  Massive imbalances between the expansion decks is a problem. Deckbuilding could give it a lot more life, if you're into that sort of thing and don't want to spend huge cash on a collectible.

RATING: 8.5
[u]May 2009:[/u] Just realized I still hadn't rated this one. This is a great card game. It plays easily and smoothly. There are a great deal of difficult decision making. Playing with different decks changes entrely the way you have to think. The same goes, you really have to adapt to the other decks, you just cannot play the same way against two different decks.
I might not have played enough of every confrontation to know for sure but the game really seems very well balanced.
I didn't start deck building yet and the game doesn't need that to be great. I guess I might start deck building if I ever start of becoming bored with it. But right now, without the inquisitors expansions, I don't see deck building as a great addition to this game, specially considering that, according to the rules, you'll just change 3 or 4 cards max from the standard decks.

The only reason I don't rate it higher is because of the price of it once you have all the decks, and you'll want to have all the decks, because every deck just really play sdifferently and the strategies become so much more varied.

There is a long learning curve as to play well you need to know exactly all the cards in your deck, as well as all the cards in the opponent's. This way, you can wait to have your combos come out and you can prevent the other. So you have some time before actually mastering any confrontation, however, the learning curve, even if difficultly capped, is not steep and the game is very approachable.

A word on the Vulca deck:
The Vulcas are a fire powerhorse. You want to play high cards in fire and put a lot of pressure. This doesn't mean that in earth fights, you should just quit, you still have some room to make the opponent suffer to win a dragon. It could seem as a pretty straightforward deck but it actually isn't as your win will depend on your ability to not go overkill on fire whilst giving a good fight in earth, which is feasible but not an easy task.

A word on Hoax:
The Hoax are one of my favourite decks. Their low power and tons of special texts mae them very fun to play. This is a real combo deck. It is hard to get the hang on as most often, you'll have to have the perfect timing to make its combos effective but when you do, they'll be very hard to beat. This necessary timing will make you want to know exactly what the other one is doing, even more than with other decks.

8.5 is my rating for the game overall, considering you have all decks except the inquisitors.

With just the base game, I'd rate it a 7.5 as the game is very good, lthough it won't have as much replay value.

Since for all other expansions, I'll just rate what I think of the deck, I'll rate the two base decks:

Hoax: 9
Vulca: 7

Different rates don't mean that one deck is more powerful than the other, I've already said that the decks were bamanced. This reflect more my enjoyment of playing wth this deck.

[u]October 09:[/u] Just realized that even though I've played 50+ plays of this, I still am very far from having the impression of knowing the game well. Of course this is because I've got all decks. But still, no boredom whatsoever after 50+ plays is very good!

[u]January 10:[/u] Blue Moon is back on my gaming table with a rage, it just got 20 plays in the first 10 days of january. The game is just that engrossing. You just want to play over and over again!

RATING: 6.5
To me, Blue Moon is a somewhat casual 2 player game. It’s not as casual as Lost Cities of course, but it’s no Summoner Wars either. It just feels relaxing when playing as the gameplay and rules are so simple (it is a Knizia game, so it’s no wonder). I like the “push back and forth” mechanism of trying to get the dragons over to your side. The base game with its two decks is neat and they feel very different to play, and the mutant is a card which can screw your opponent’s plan. I really like the support cards and how you play those along with the power cards for your character cards. The way you choose to lead a round with fire or earth, and the fact that you can always retreat and give up the round if you don’t think you’ll win it is pretty cool as is how the game can end in two ways and that there is a (albeit slight) chance to win instantly.

If I didn’t own a game like Summoner Wars I would probably buy some more factions and play Blue Moon more. My wife and a friend both like the game, but none of them love it. The same goes for me. And I don’t really see the point of owning a game which people won’t actively suggest playing, so off it went. But it is a neat game to be sure, and I actually do consider to buy the new version as you get 9 different factions…

The cards are beautiful but the game hasn't blown me away. To me it feels like an unhappy meeting between Lost Cities and Magic: the Gathering. In the base game, there aren't many clever tricks or combos you can make so you just kind of sit and wait for the good cards to turn up. I will give it more of a chance though. 

I played a game with the Terrah and Aqua decks yesterday. The Terrah deck really let me pound my opponent into the ground with some clever comboing. It was interesting compared to the usual very even maneuver-coutermaneuver of the base game. Maybe the new decks are very good fun. Pity they are so expensive here in the UK. Maybe my rating will go up.

Fun game somewhat in the style of Scarab Lords, though with a smoother feel and more options (to come).  UPDATED: My rating of the game, after having played more, has increased.  I now think this is one of the best two player Kosmos games, and much superior to Scarab Lords.  Many of the comments I've seen reflect playing the game only one or two times and then assuming deck X is lopsided.  I think this game is deep enough that you have to play quite a few times with each deck to get an understanding of the different strategies.  UPDATED: I haven't had much interest in playing this lately, so I've dropped the rating a bit.

One of the greatest two players games. It is often said, that bidding games are not so good for two players. Blue Moon is the proof, that is not true!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I'm not too keen on games where decent play mandates memorization of 60 cards, but I'll make an exception here (and even forgive the lame theme).

Blue Moon is a climbing trick-taking game for two players, where each player draws from his own unique deck of cards.  In the majority of hands, both players will see every card in their deck, so it's important to know what to hold onto and what to throw away.  Much of the game involves 'flushing out' what amount to other players' trumps and aces, sacrificing one trick to win a guaranteed handful later.  The point value of a trick doubles once players become heavily invested in it, and that adds a great dimension to the questions you'll be asking yourself: Does he have this trump or ace?  Will this card be enough to flush it out, or do I have to convince him I'm in this trick for the long haul by building my bids slowly?  He's almost invested enough to double the stakes--do I keep going and actually try to win the trick, or concede now?

This is really cool stuff but you can't get to 90% of it until you know the decks pretty well.  In the meantime it's a decent, entirely tactical trick-taking game with a lot of luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Two plays - just enough time with this game to sense that there are multi strategies to discover here.  For example, I was pleased to discover the dimension of strategy of trying to make your opponent run out of cards. I had a flash of feeling that this was like RK's Ivanhoe with two suits per card.

I really thought I wouldn't be too interested in this one, but I really like it!  We can't seem to beat the Hoax with the Vulca, except now!  The Vulca have won once.  Much more thinky than Magic: the Gathering.

RATING: 6
I suppose in many cases a designer looks at other things in their field of expertise and says to themselves "I should try one of those."  So perhaps Reiner thought when looking at CCGs.  Only this is a pretty weak, dull interpretation of a CCG if that's what it is.  The game is absolutely ravishing in appearance, but I found it underwhelming in terms of play.  Make no mistake, a good game, but if you are steeped in Magic or L5R it's not going to surpass those.

Acquired July 2008.  Owned all expansions and promos thanks to Tanga.  Special ordered some sleeves from Korea too.  Never got into the game because the artwork distrubed my wife and I wasn't too interested because it was always called a substitute for Magic (which there is no substitute).

Eventually, in February 2010, this game went OOP and I had the opportunity to sell this for the same price it took me to aquire Princes of the Renaissance.  Maybe someday I'll give it a try, but it isn't on the top of my list considering all my other options.

Am surprised at how much I enjoy this game, but what's the deal with the inequality of the two packs in the base set?  It seems that the Hoax pretty much have to be awfully lucky to beat the Vulca.  

Had to downgrade my rating a notch - it just isn't getting any table time.  

Played again after a long time and enjoyed it.  Still feel the Vulca has quite the advantage, although am now wondering if, when played right, the Hoax may be not quite as mismatched as I had previously thought.

Played one game with the basic decks...and I don't get it.  I'm withholding judgment (and rating) until I've played more, but so far it is just OK--no tension, no interesting decisions.

I decided to trade this one away.  I never really found much fun in it.  I'm kind of regretting it--I feel like I should have given it one more shot, since so many people whose opinions I respect really like it.

OK, I played this one again, and enjoyed it more.  Now I'm interested in picking up another copy, this time maybe with some other decks to go with it.  That might have been my mistake the first time--just using the basic decks.

A curious game of battling card decks.  With one play so far, I'm intrigued by how one builds a strategy each turn.  But I need more time to appreciate its possibilities.  One frustration is the rulebook, which was confusing - it took us several times reading it before we really played correctly.

2 Player only:
The cards are beautiful. I have enough card games where I compare strength values to each other to see who wins. The card text of "you" and "I" is clunky. I think the game would improve if I did some deck building....but there are other LCG's that I would rather spend my time deck building.
This game has been made obsolete by LCG's....out of my collection....

2p only.

While I love LCGs, I never really felt the need to customize decks with this one. Maybe it's because I played it enough to more or less memorize the decks.

RATING: 9.5
Rating for the entire card game family (which deviates from my normal policy to rate base games and expansions separately). My rating for just this base game would only be a 7 - it just wasn't designed to be played alone for many games: This base game with just Vulca and Hoax is already good but got a bit stale for me relatively quickly. But after playing some of the other people's decks from the expansions (that are all included in the new implementation Blue Moon Legends), I quickly found out that many of them play really differently! Which makes it very interesting to explore the different peoples and how they play against each other. See my comment for [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147154/blue-moon-legends]Blue Moon Legends[/url] for more thoughts about the entire line.

I like this 2 player duel card came. It's similar to MTG, except that it's not collectable)
You play different creatures and boost them, then your opponent does the same, untill any of you gives up. Simple and deep the same time.

Components: The cards are beautiful to behold and a pleasure to use. The special text is surprisingly straightforward, though the more I play it the more questions I have about how certain cards interact; the iconography is effective. I like the structured, finite, full-disclosure collectability of the game; perhaps the first “living card game”.

Experience: Much more straightforward than it looks. A few opportunities for cleverness arise, but for the most part I continue a battle if I'm able, in the hopes that my opponent won't be able to respond. The battle can turn rather quickly, based on card draws. The game is somewhat relaxing in its simplicity.

060121: I've only played this a few times, and I'm a long way from knowing the decks I've got (Hoax, Vulca, Mimix, Flit and Khind). It's probably unfair to compare it with Magic, but it lacks the tactical options of the king of CCGs. That said, considering Knizia is not a specialist CCG designer, the balance appears to be very good.
I do want to explore the Blue Moon world further, including Blue Moon City.

Artwork takes some getting used to, but is definitely unique.  The game itself has tons of strategy, and knowing when to give up a battle is very important.  Plays quickly and with lots of decks out there to play with, there is plenty in these small boxes to keep you coming back for quite some time.

I like it, and while some factions may appear unbalanced or require more finesse to play, I like the challenge and appreciate the flavor each people deck has that makes them different in the Blue Moon universe. For deckbuilding, I'd rather do a 'real' CCG such as Doomtown or Jyhad/VTES.  individual decks not rated-rating for game as a whole.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This "sexy" 2 player card game has a lot of subtle depth that is not obvious in the first few play sessions.  Once both players become more familiar with their cards and their opponent's (basic set), the game can get quite tense and more interesting.  This game is about timely, clever card play.  The lovely artwork on the cards captures the mood and theme of the world and people of Blue Moon extremely well.

Updated: Jan 2006 - Even though I added the Flit, Mimix, Terrah and Khind, sadly my primary playing partner (wife) just doesn't request playing it.

The art on the cards looks great. Looks like the board and the dragons are just unneeded though. Could just as easily buy two expansion decks and used counters instead of the dragons.. Seems like a simple game at first, since there's only one active creature card in the battle. However, there's a good amount of strategy here, and a whole lot more could be added with the creation of a custom deck.

Rating 8. I love good art, and I love card games. I hate CCG money sinks, but this system appears to have a price cieling so its not so bad. Love the pick up and play of this game.
UPDATE: This is one of the games I have enjoyed and PLAYED the most. This is a great game, satisfying and good tension. The turnabouts are surprising and enjoyable. Raised rating 8.75, great art makes a good impression on new players. Strongly recommend getting at least a couple expansion decks to give you variety. 
Update: 9.5 this is my top played game, will always play if asked. carry it around in my pack to play "just in case" I meet a friend.
Its true you want to get a couple expansion decks for variety.

Short Description
-------------------------------
Blue Moon is a card-game for two players. Each player plays with their own unique, preconstructed deck of 30 cards and tries to win a series of fights. Each deck represents one people from the Blue Moon-Universe. Included in the base-set are the Hoax and the Vulca. More people-decks are available as expensions.

In each fight, the players take alternating turns in which they normally play up to one character-card and usually one support- or booster-card from their hand. After playing the cards, the player announces their power in either earth or fire. Their power must at least be equal to the opposing players power from their last turn. The corresponding values to calculate your current power from are printed on the cards. Once one player can't at least match the announced power from their opponents turn, they have to retreat. The winning player then attracts one or two dragons, depending on the number of cards they have already in play.

When one player has attracted a fourth dragon, they win instantly. The game ends also, when one of the two players has no cards left. In this case, the player who attracted more dragons wins. In case of a tie, the player who has still cards left in his hand is the winner.

--------------------------
Comments
--------------------------
* Blue Moon is my first exposure to the card-duel-mechanism which is also used in CCG-games like Magic: The Gathering or  YU-Gi-Oh and I have to admit, that I deeply enjoy it. On your turn, you (normally) have six cards in your hand and it's your job to find a good combination of cards that will gain you enough power to match your opponent's currently announced power while staying competitive for the rest of the game.

* Although the rules are fairly easy, the game itself isn't. You have to know your deck and the available card-combinations of both your and your opponent's deck quite well in order to play effective. In this regard, Blue Moon reminds me of Race for the galaxy, where a good knowledge of cards and combinations is also the key to success. To learn the game, you can try MrKeldon's excellent AI-Version which is available at [url]http://keldon.net/bluemoon/[/url]. But be prepared to lose quite a lot in the beginning.

* While I enjoy the learning process that comes with this game, I know some players don't. So before buying the game, you should decide whether or not you have someone who will play this game with you. The somewhat limited group of players I can play the game with is the only reason, why I don't rate it higher. Would it appeal more to my non-gaming friends, it would be a sure ten.

* The game has a lot of depth to discover. Even after about 75 games (most against the AI), I learn new powerful combinations for the two people-decks of the base-set. So Blue Moon gets a thumb up for great replayability.

* The available expansion-decks seem to be greatly balanced and each one supports a different play-style which has to be discovered and learned once you get a new deck. Some of them might not fit your taste, but I guess you'll have a good time while deciding if they do. For this reason, I rate each expansion deck just like the base-game. Surely there are some expansion-decks that I like more than others, but I guess each one is a good addition to the game and enhances the replayability of an already great game.

* The game plays quick. After 20-30 Minutes you are done with it. Normally this leads to a series of games.

* Blue Moon is pure player-interaction with a high screw- and, since it is a card-game, also a built-in luck-factor. Stay away from the game if you don't like this.

* I discovered Blue Moon too late. Unfortunately it is out of print. While the base-set still seems to be widely available, the expansion decks aren't. This means, you either have to pay quite a lot for them or you can't even buy them anymore, which is a shame since I'd love to own them all.

Constructable, but not collectible.  Brilliant.  Beautiful art, but rules not 100% clear (definition of 'draw'? definition of 'play'?).  Tug of war style play is great, you can throw a round the opponent attacks too strongly on to waste his cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A card/battle game where each player takes a themed deck and fights a series of "fights" against their opponent.  A fight is simply trying to equal or better your opponent's last play.  Special powers on the cards make things interesting and lead to some interesting and suprising combinations.  Winner of a fight gets to lure dragons to their side, which is how victory is judged at the end of the battle.  The different decks will ensure this game stays fresh for literally years to come.  A wonderful game, where having a "feel" for the cards is essential - stay and fight, or retreat and come back swinging.  The "six cards played doubles the stakes" rule is inspired.  A slow burner for me, but have been playing it regularly lately, and am starting to see it's genius.

There are a lot of good points to Blue Moon: non-collectability and gorgeous oversized cards being two key ones for me. One of the best two-player card games designs out there, and it is helped greatly by the attractive pre-constructed format. Buy as little or as much as you want without worries of collectability. It scratches the CCG itch and is better than most every CCG on the market actually.

My wife and I enjoy this one.  When we first started, the Vulca were dominant, but now that we've got some experience with the game, I can't win with them (but she still beats me with them occassionally)!  However, I'm getting closer to learing "Advanced Vulca" strategy that can compete with the Hoax's killer combos.  
I love the way every deck is a new play experience.  Before I got into the game, I actually thought I wouldn't like having to work to figure out every new deck, but it turns out I enjoy it.  The game is still opening up for me, and I like it more the more I play.
I like playing to 5 crystals, switching decks after each round.  That way we can mitigate inexperience with a deck by trying to get the least hammered using it.

The rulebook could have been clearer on some aspects of gameplay -- early misunderstandings of the rules may turn people off.  Worth persisting though...on the surface, the core game seems to have balance issues.  Make sure you play the rules properly (there's a great FAQ floating on the web) and over time you will find an incredible depth within the game.

I bought this after I tried [gameid=36218], which I thought was my first [gameid=463]-like game.  I read reviews that said it was like Magic without the collectible necessity.

I also liked [gameid=21882], and I like Knizia games.  I wanted more of a theme battle game to play 2-player with my son, since he is not terribly excited about euros like [gameid=50].  

This was perfect.  It is a fast game with a fun theme.  The interaction of the cards is great, and I have become a big Blue Moon theme fan.

My rating for Blue Moon is for the system as a whole rather than what comes in this box alone.  The reason I say this is that I feel that there could have been better people deck choices for a little more even match up in the base game.  Maybe that's my inexperience speaking though.  Blue Moon is great if you invest in Blue Moon.  I say that because the more Blue Moon you buy, the more variety you get in the end.  Thankfully it's not as much of a money pit as CCG's or even LCG's.  Though it is similar to LCG's if Knizia had continued releasing more decks.  If you purchase it all, you get a great variety of match ups using just the pre-constructed decks as is or alternatively you can delve into the realm of deck construction.  It somewhat scratches a CCG itch (moreso than Dominion) and for less of a price (though not as cheap as Dominion).  Definitely a good experience for the cost if you're willing to invest.  I can only see ratings going up with more plays.

The thing I like most about this game is the CCG feel, but with out the C part.  I like everything about CCGs except the collection part, where you have to shell out big bucks to stay competetive, and eash game is imbalanced because one player has the nicer deck.  This one keeps the mechanics, the cards, and the general feel, but publishes very different, but well balanced decks.  No collecting.

A dueling card game with some CCG elements.  The game play doesn't require a lot of decisions or analysis, but I like the way the conflict escalates and the pressure to keep up with your opponent.

There's something I can't put my finger on about this game. It's so simple that it doesn't seem like much at first glance. But it just sucks you in. Once you start playing, you can't stop. There so much subtle variabilities you just want to keep playing to discover them all. Basically, it has the same blend of strategic game plan and tactical management like Magic: The Gathering but it's not a money sinkhole like M:TG.

I have only played the base game for Blue Moon, but still feel as if there is much to discover before adding any expansion decks. The mechanics are extremely elegant, requiring forethought and planning (and a working knowledge of your deck) to play well. We've run into a few balance issues, but those will most likely go away as we become more comfortable with the decks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Highly rated for good reason, much like a CCG but without the collectible part.  Game-play is simpler than MtG, but initial impressions are positive.  The decks are very well balanced, and enjoyment of the game increases as you get familiar with all the cards and can plan combinations and anticipate counters.  Much of the game is about careful card management, since you usually will play virtually all 30 different cards of your deck.  The theme is somewhat unappealing and the artwork on some Vulca and Mimix cards is unfortunately somewhat risque.  Those who have similar issues and enjoy the gameplay will want to consider getting one of the expansion decks to replace the Vulca cards and for more replay value.

I also own five of the expansion decks: [gameid=19740] (earth - simpler power deck) is a good choice to replace the base Vulca (fire - power deck) against the base Hoax (scholars - trick deck).  Note that Mimix has even more risque artwork than Vulca.  Recommended as other good first choice expansions are [gameid=19736] (birds - combo deck) and [gameid=19737](children - combo deck), then [gameid=19741] (caterpillars - trick deck) and [gameid=19738] (water - speed deck).

It is not a CTG or CCG! It is simply a game that comes with two different set of cards and it can be expanded to eight different sets of cards which can be mixed (in a very limited way) together. The game itself is very tactical, if you are familiarized with the strange winning conditions, it's a real blast...

RATING: 6
An non-collectable CCG, this is a simple 2 player contest fighting over dragons. Play characters to your side, trying to over power your opponent. Add leadership,support and booster cards to your side, engage special rules effects, and figure out what is happening. Not bad when you get the hang of the turn order, but I lost badly in the end with a hand full of low strength characters and nothing else. Because you are drawing blind from your draw deck, if you don't have the right cards in your hand, you're stuffed. The rules effects were good, but needed a little figuring, typical for this style of game. If you like CCGs, you might find this too light. If you dislike rules lawyering, this is not too bad. If you dislike direct conflict, well this is a fight game. Me, I enjoyed it but wasn't thrilled. Not quite my cup of tea. More plays will help, but fundamentally this is not my kind of game. But I do recommend Blue Moon City, which uses the same art and design, the same game elements, but is a very interesting boardgame with no rules effects to argue over.

I think of this as RK's answer to Magic, call me crazy if you will.  I like its simple escalation of traded blows format, and think it's fun to play.  I haven't really become interested in taking apart all the different decks and building one of my own, however...  Maybe it's just a little too mechanical to get two people geared up about the decks?

* Played 30+ times. Even without the expansions, I find this game very addictive. A neat system where most cards have values in one of two elements, with the fighting element changing from battle to battle, and sometimes even in the middle. Neat actions cards, and assymetrical decks, combined with a good base rule system and wonderful graphics make this a smash. The only reason my rating has fallen to an 8 is because I discovered Magic the Gathering, which is more sophisticated and offers more variability than this game.

Graphics are amazing.  

I am a card player, but just can't get into this game.  A lot of luck in draw of the cards, unless you have the expansions (which I do) to construct your own 30 card hands.  The problem with that, is that you can spend hours constructing a hand, and frankly, on this game, I don't want to invest that kind of time.  

Also, the player who knows not only his own cards well, but those of his opponent, and remembers what has been played, has an advantage.

Update:  This game has risen quite a bit for me lately.  It's one of those games that I really had to play a bunch to to enjoy.  What after a couple of plays felt random has become really good now that the decks have started to sink in.  I bet it took about 20 plays with the same deck for me to really appreciate this game.  Add in all the other decks and the system has a ton of replay, which gets more tense as you know the decks better.  When I realized it's a game about timing retreats rather than blowing away opponents every battle, it got better.  Still, if you're only going to give it a couple of plays, I'd rate it a 6.


I've had some trouble getting into Blue Moon.  I think it's a beautiful set of card decks and I understand why people enjoy it but I have to work to find the depth in it.  With all the cards, decks and combos you really have to learn a lot to try and see all the game has to offer- and I'm not sure I've done it!  I feel the payoff for learning the game isn't too much greater than the enjoyment I get from a tighter, snappier game like Lost Cities.  I have the Pillar, Mimix and Terrah and Flit decks.

RATING: 9
Knizias take on a CCG, without even being collectible. This is the game Magic the Gathering should have been. This game is astonishing. The balance between the preconstructed decks seems to be perfect. You can enjoy the base game as is, but if you get the expansions and start building your own decks the game becomes even better. Like in Taj Mahal and Beowulf you really have to pick your fights and know when to fold. The only minus is the cheesy graphics and setting. Knizias strength certainly is game designing, not writing fantasy fiction.

A collectible card game (sort of) with some gorgeous and sometimes very strange art. It is played in battles where players play cards trying to one-up each other.

Great 2 player card game that plays quickly and still has a good amount of depth. I'm bumping this up to a 10 now after about 40 plays. The concept is simple, the gameplay is easy to learn, but the interactions between cards make it so this game never gets old. I haven't even started deck building yet and I still am not even close to bored with Blue Moon. I play it on my lunch break 3-4 times a week, and I wish I could play it more. Knizia has another winner on his hands. Can't wait to see what the new decks will bring! Easily my favorite 2 player game.

RATING: 3
Reiner Knizia's Blue Moon, aka "Magic for Dummies". Looks great, feels like a CCG, but is clearly inferior to a good CCG (i.e., MtG - howl if you want, critics, but it's undeniable). The secret lies in the ability to tune your deck to what you're expecting to play against. The fun lies in the metagame - what deck you're playing and what deck your opponent is playing. The card universe of Blue Moon is too small to make it interesting. This is a decent entry-level game for people who've never been into MtG, L5R, OTE or the other top-flight CCGs (sort of a simpler take on the old MtG entry-level variant Portal). For those who are CCG vets, it's like drinking a good table wine after savoring a bottle of Chateau Petrus... By the way, this thing is horrendously overproduced. The board and the dragons are wholly unnecessary, and the tarot-sized cards won't fit into any deck protector that I know of. The art is no better or worse than average MtG work. Kosmos was clearly looking for a few extra bucks here, but at the cost of portability. The whole game could have fit in an Adlung-sized package. A point off for that - card games like this are supposed to be portable. That said, if you want to have a simple 2P card game with the basic flavor of the old, original MtG ruleset without the baggage that the whole MtG name carries these days (unjustly, I might add) then give BM a try. MtG fans won't find anything here that they haven't already seen, and done much better in MtG. I wonder if Knizia even broke a sweat putting this game together; he should send Richard Garfield a thank-you note, if not a % of the royalties. :) *** UPDATE: After going 0-for-6 in trying to get interest from other players by teaching them BM, I have to label the game a disappointment. I'm done with BM with four boosters in shrink.

Not my thang, I guess. To be fair, I didn't play it enough to get the real flavor and depth of the game, but with one play, this felt like LOTR: Confrontation without the bluffing or moving pieces, and it just felt like something was missing. 

Also, the cards while beautiful, were so cluttered with text I had a hard time filtering out the important information.

I might try it again in the future to give it another chance, but it could be that the CCG type thing just isn't for me.

RATING: 6
I like this game. I would describe it as a variant on the card classic - war, but you hold a hand and draw cards at random rather than just a random draw. The mechs are simple and there are enough cards in a deck to keep it interesting. Plus there is a deck builder mech if you are inclined to collect decks. The artwork on the cards and the cards themselves are first rate so no complaints there. I even give high marks on theme. There definitely is a strong theme built around the mechs, problem is the theme is kinda... meh. Unlike a LotR themed game there is no popular hook. I visited the FF site to see if they provided more fluff, there was a little, but it wasn't inspiring. Lastly, come on *another* nerdy sci-fantasy setting!?! This game will chase women from the room screaming.

I would have preferred the same mechs and great materials of construction grafted on to a less ubiquitous fight night theme. Imagine Ali vs Frasier... or Chuck Norris' Kick Boxer... how about Monday Night Football!?! Any of those would have been better.

A simple but deep Reiner Knizia game.  After reading the rulebook, I thought "That's it? It's just a themed version of War!"  However, it is so much deeper than it appears.  As oxymoronic as it sounds, this is a brain-burning filler. Also, it is less intimidating for new players than other "simple but deep" games like Go (no, Blue Moon isn't THAT deep), and it plays quickly.

A good portion of the strategy revolves around knowing when to cut your losses.

Knizia takes a stab at CCG's, and the results are solid gold.  This game is incredibly well-balanced.  Some decks are easier for beginners than others, but no deck is better than another.

The game is like a combination of tennis, poker, and Magic the Gathering.  When you play creatures, you are basically bidding, and your opponent must match you or up the ante.  But when someone gets to 6 cards, the battle is worth a lot more so if you think you don't have what it takes to win, you might want to cut your losses early.

It reminds me of tennis because the game is played in several, short rounds, and when you win a battle you capture dragons, which can be recaptured from you.  This leads to a sort of match-point scenario.  Pretty awesome idea!  And there are enough different decks and different expansions to give the game endless replay value.  One of the better games I've played.

I have plated several dozen games against Mr.Keldons program which includes all the expansions. (I only log face to face games).

This is War turned into a real game.  It adds the choice of two domains, variable values for the cards depending on domain and special powers on some of the cards. The cards do impart a different flavor to each of the factions and there are a variety of strategies. However, there is little thematic carry through - typical of Knizia cards games. I suspect I would like the game a lot better if it was more than two player and involved four or more possible domains. As it is it strikes me as rather flat.

This game didn’t make sense to me until someone showed me that it is a bit like poetry - - its only becomes enjoyable when you read the text out loudly in over semi-serious tones. Played this way, it goes from a 5 to a 7 (10/12/08).  Update: The desire to play this has gone, rating back down to 5 (25/10/10). UPDATE: when I look at this game, I do admire the production values.  I think the reasons why I never got enamoured with this game is that you need to play it many times to really understand the decks (and I don't currently play games many times), but I think the key reason is that this was the first game I owned where it is implied that to really enjoy the playing experience, you should have all the decks. So, the original game is just a crippling of the full experience, and you need to spend more money to get more of the originally designed game? Nope - archived, and rating down to 4).

Do you want to know a game that is greater than the sum of its parts? Blue Moon is that game. The rules are almost too simple to ever believe this game is more than what it, in fact, is: a number comparison game, with the player who withdraws from the battle first losing a point to their opponent. But what you don't realize until you play is that the tension is HUGE and the push-your-luck aspect never feels random. The special powers are often neat and the asymmetrical balance of the different races is always intriguing. This is obviously a Knizia game (his ability to make deep games with a simple number comparison system is his greatest strength) but has a very nice Fantasy wallpaper to the whole thing. I'm telling you: get this game if you like Knizia. This is a beautiful system of his.

As close as I will ever probably get to a CCG, with my brother's Netrunner an exception.  I enjoy this small Knizia offering as it forces some creative hand management and timing decisions to play effectively.  The expansions are growing but still acceptable, and offer a lot more longevity to this game.  An interesting quick mid weight two player.

update: With a few more games behind me, and playing with a few of the expansions, the fear I previously had of this feeling like a CCG has subsided - in reference to endless collectability, and hours spent building decks.  The fact that each deck is what it is, and the uniqueness of each faction providing new flavour Blue Moon shines.

I enjoy the Magic-the Gathering like aspect of the game without the CCG nightmare. Seemed slightly unbalanced in the 5 or so games I have played. Leans towards the Vulca for ease of use but with Hoax I can basically outlast the Vulca. May be better with expansions.

Blue Moon is Reiner Knizia's take on Magic the Gathering without collectibility. It is instead a “living card game”, but one that was limited to a specific number of expansions.

I got this game with the hope that I'd get my wife to play it.  That never really panned out, but it's not a bad game.  If I'm ever in a position where I can get more two player games in, I'll be looking to break this game out again.

RATING: 7
Decent game, well thought out and like most Knizias it is very balanced. Add all the expansions and it gets better. For some reason though I still don't find it as good as his others.

As far as production goes, the cards look great and all the extra bits are nice, if irrelevant. Almost never bother with the board anymore. It's a shame that rules don't come with the expansions. Also while I like the large cards I wish that they would fit into sleeves.

This is very fun right off the bat, and excellent once you add some of the expansion decks. The game fits a lot of strategy into a quick game experience. But the cards you draw and the interplay of different decks keeps each session new.

Now I know that CCG's and Co. are not for me. This game has a touch of genious and I can see that it's deep and rich. I simply didn't enjoy playing it, having in mind that you must buy a few expansions and play every one of them more than a dozen of times to have a slight idea of what's going on and why you lost so badly.

Definitely not my cup of tea. But the game itself is superb.

A good and quick two-player game that benefits from several clearly different and thematic decks and nice variety in creating your own decks. The gameplay is deceptively simple as the importance of knowing your deck becomes obvious after few plays.

Magic: the Gathering methadone. Interesting for its short, high-tension rounds and the tug-of-war like scoring. Got into it too late to get more races before they went out of print, so the strategic aspect of deckbuilding is sadly lost on me.

The possible subtleties of clever card play are amazing.  The rules are so simple I had to keep rereading, wondering where the game was.  Creativity in card combos feels very important - how weird is that?  I REALLY thought the tiny deck size would make the game repetitive and dull - far from it.  The "HAHA!  Screw YOU!" Factor is delicious and leads to loads of laughing and oaths of revenge.

From reading the rules, the game looks like it wouldn't work at all. It sounds trite, almost pointless, like Knizia has attempted to capture the essence of a collectible card game and missed the point entirely. Knizia has fooled me before with this same trick. Ever read the rules to Flinke Pinke? How about Quo Vadis? Even Modern Art sounds kind of ridiculous based on the rules alone. Well, Blue Moon is good. Very good. I don’t yet have a sense for whether it will remain very good for a long, long time, or whether it will burn out after the decks become too familiar. It probably will burn out eventually, but I think there’s plenty of play before that happens. I’m not interested in the deck-building portion of the game; my rating is based on the constructed decks only.

Revised from 5 to 6.5 after playing the expansions. I still don't see this as being as cool as "drafted from a common pool Magic the Gathering" (which is how we play) but after playing all available decks I have to say that the Hoax is a kinda sad deck, and probably not the best for the starter box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Past the forty-play mark now. I've played all of the expansion decks at least once. It doesn't seem like there ought to be so much fun, drama and tension in this game, but there is. With only 30 cards you're managing your deck as you pass through it, trying to keep the right amount of flow while getting the most bang out of every card. Fights can escalate completely out of control with tight spots on both sides...whew! Lots of fun, though please note that players will get the most out of the game when they become familiar with the decks; if you're only going to play it once, don't bother. I like all the expansion decks, but the Aqua and the Mimix are particularly good fits with my play style. Incidentally, my rating is that of the entire game with all the expansions; just the base set on its own would be a 7 or an 8.

UPDATE: I finally bumped this one up to a 10.

Being a TCG player for over 10 years, I really think this game is not worth it.  It lacks in alot of ways including strategies, decisions and different effects.  You just can't compare this to any TCGs.

I swore I wouldn't play CCGs (due to personal biases), and I still won't. From those who are familiar, though, they say this game does a fair impersonation of one. The fantasy theme is kind of a turn-off, but getting cool card combinations to work is very satisfying.

I wanted to like this game, and I do recognize the subtleties of play, but it's just too much work. Similar to Babel, I feel like it's just added complexity to a simple premise. *UPDATE* I've given it another chance, after having been away from it for a very long time. I definitely liked it better, and am now eager to play more to see if this feeling continues. Discovered one important rule I had wrong, and that probably made the biggest difference. No rating change yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I imagine this will go a very long way with all the extra decks. I didn't get bored with the base set even after many plays, and each new deck adds multiple matchups to keep it fresh. And that's before my itchy fingers get to do some deckbuilding.

Familiarity with the cards is essential for the game to really shine, but it's quick-playing enough to build up knowledge of them painlessly. I was indifferent to the theme at first, but it has grown on me considerably. Can't wait to get more decks.

This is the most likely candidate in my collection to become a future 10.

Not quite as heavy-hitting as I would like; a bit too much on the luckish side.  A great deal of variety is available through many expansions, but I don't like the deck cross-over seeding - it is an obvious hook to pull in completists.

It left me a little cold after the first play. I was concerned about too much luck and unbalanced decks. However, that first impression soon vanished and I found the game very addictive. The extra races bring variety and replayability. If you enjoy the game, getting at least one or two of those decks is almost compulsory.

RATING: 7
this is the first game that made it very apparent to me how important matching players with games can be.  had some good experiences with some players and very bad experience with others.  willing to play again and I feel like I need to get to know some of the decks to gain an appreciation for it.
update (2007-08-06) - having become a bit addicted to the Marvel Trading Card Game on my PSP, I decided to give this another try.  My wife suggested it, thinking it was Blue Moon City.  She almost reneged when I handed her the two decks so she could see the artwork.  We both enjoyed it quite a bit.  I'm raising my rating up 2 points to 7.  Maybe one of those points is just because it's a game that my wife will actually play with me.

The biggest problem is that both players need to know what they're doing to make it really good.

Rating after 5-6 hands.  I've enjoyed the game more every time I've played it so far.  First 4 hands or so were with the Vulca -- and I wasn't particularly impressed with that deck.  Subsequently I've played the Khind and the Aqua and enjoyed them both.  I hope that my rating of this game goes up as I play it more and get into constructing decks.
**(7 to 8) Updated 1/16/07 - Have played 15-20 hands now.  I like having access to all the people decks.  I'm getting to know each deck's strengths and weaknesses more, though sometimes I still feel at the mercy of the draw.  Much like Poker, you have to know which hands to play and which to fold.  I'm still waiting to get a good enough feel for it to make deckbuilding enjoyable.  I think this game has the potential for a 9+ rating if you have a group of players interested in deck construction.

RATING: 10
Reiner Knizia's  take on Magic -- and boy does he ever take something that is wild and crazy into something that is far more balanced AND doesn't require the ongoing purchase of further cards to play. Blue Moon is likely to remain my favorite Knizia and for good reason. It's simple enough to introduce to people but it is difficult to master. Unfortunately, any degree of mastery first comes with getting a handle of the deck you are using, but then with knowing opponents decks. This is not to say that you have to know them inside and out, but there are certainly key cards in each deck that are worth keeping track of (e.g., Flit has three birds with a value of 4. If you can force them out and into the discard pile, you put them in a bit of a tighter pickle). While some argue that there are clear 'tiers' for decks, every deck has a fair chance against every other. In short, it's just a great dueling card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A semi-collectable Knizia card game with a great fantasy theme. It reminds me of both Lost Cities and Magic. It doesn't get a higher rating because of the inherent rules complications that arise from having so many special rules.

====
In the end this just didn't appeal to me enough to really plunge in. It seemed to reward deck memorization far too much, and the win conditions were just weird. I've logged 59 plays, and for the life of me I can't remember the win conditions now... that's the sign of a seriously unintuitive game. Good try but just not my thing. Traded away.

Beautiful art. Gameplay simple and straightforward, but still enough strategy to have fun.

Updated from 6 to 7: when you got the 8 Armies, the game becomes more deep and challenging. However, I don't recommend the "Emissaries&Inquisitor" expansions.

Updated from 7 to 5: burned. The best way to emulate a collectible card game is playing a collectible card game. Blue Moon feels too abstract: I have no feel of "combat", only playing numbers. After hitting Vampire:TES again, I have no longer played Blue Moon.

Blue moon is a two player game of battling cards. I had the game years ago and it wasn't really doing it for me.  Maybe it was who I was playing against or the fact that I was very into heavy games back then - I don't know.  I ended up trading one copy away with a few expansions for mint copies of Ingenious, Settlers of Catan (4th edition) and Modern Art.  That was a great math trade!  (Springtime Math Trade 04/2008)  Since then, I've been regretting trading this one away and ended up trading Medina for Blue Moon and 8 expansions in an Aug 2010 math trade.  Given the fact it's not going to be reprinted, that was a great trade.  I've been playing Blue Moon a lot lately and I have been enjoying it a lot more this time around - maybe since I've been playing it against my gamer wife this time.  I must say that this is the perfect husband and wife game.  She really enjoys the game and will always agree to play.  Even when you are getting beaten badly, it is not a super serious game and there is lots of laughing and trash talk.  This game is lots and lots of fun and I highly recommend it.

Update 11/07: Still love it.  What a robust system!
Update 1/08:  Increasing rating to 10 as a byproduct of my experience with the Blue Moon AI and my subsequent increased play.  This game is all kinds of awesome.

The more I play Blue Moon, the better I like it.  My rating has increased from an initial 8 to the current rating of 9.  I now have all of the decks that have been released and have found them to be well themed, well constructed and surprisingly well balanced against each other.  Blue Moon scratches my CCG itch without the cost or time requirements of a CCG.

A good 2 player card game but I'm no longer interested in playing.  I only played with the standard decks (all of them) & never tried deck building or playing with the Emissaries & Inquisitors.

The strategy isn't immediately obvious so it's worth playing a bit & you really need a good opponent (who enjoys this type of thing & is willing to learn the decks) to make the most of it.

Hmmm. I only played this a couple aof times an didn't get to it. I am sure I would like it a lot better whice 3-4 expansions and some more plays then. With just the base game which I have its not for me a good game (I should proberly give it a grade 4).
Played more than recorded.

Well, this seemed like an overly simple game at first.  Then I went and bought all the decks, forming an unhealthy habit that has yet to abate... Damn you Knizia...

My dearest compliment is that, at its heart, this is really a great couple's game.  I know a lot of people criticize it for not having substantial player choices but lemme' tell you - strategies can get quite intense once you've learned a deck.  Truly, the game has the best back and forth see-saw battles ever (EVAR!).  There's so much subtlety in card combinations that the game has an endless string of possibilities, compounding the replayability.  I could wax poetically about the genius of the design all day; I think it's that good.

RATING: 6.3
When it gets compared to M:tG, I was expecting a messy layering of rules for some reason.  In reality, Blue Moon still plays very smooth and straight forward.

It does have a "tug-of-war" basis, which I usually don't like, but I thought it was covered up enough in this one.  Also, I really like the whole idea of just out-lasting your opponent.

It isn't quite as tight as Schotten-Totten, but I do enjoy the fun art work.  I'm sure it will see it's fair share of play.

I really wanted to like this game, but it is just not good.  So what is not to like... it looks good, it was designed by one of my favorite game designers, and it has a CCG feel, which is a positive in my opinion.  Verbalizing its faults is difficult.  While the game has a CCG feel, execution just isn't as fun as I expected.  When playing this game, I find myself wishing I was instead playing MTG or Babel, or even Scarab Lords.

Impression after a few plays: great artwork, interesting theme, rules are a little more fiddly than other Kosmos 2-player games but still relatively easy to learn.

RATING: 6
When compared to other CCG style games such as Magic this game pales in comparison with a relative lack of strategic play style options.  However, when compared to other light euros such as the other games in the Kosmos 2 player family, this game fits right in and is a bit above average.  The fantasy style art is average at best.  Most annoying of all is the choice of components.  I hate the fact that many euros use non-standard card sizes.  The small cards in many euros are annoying, but often forgivable because the cards are usually only a small part of the game.  However, ANY game which focuses primarily on card play including BLUE MOON and Ticket to Ride should most definitely stick with standard sized cards.  They are what we are all used to holding comfortably and can be protected from wear by sleeves if heavily played.   The use of oversized cards cost this game a half-point in my rating.

After 2 plays ("campaigns" to 5 crystals - not just single trips through the deck), this merited a 7.  After a week's worth of thought and a few more games, it was up to an 8.

Also, I'm not very good at this one.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (October 2015)

As most games from Reiner Knizia fell flat for me, I wasn’t in a hurry to try Blue Moon, but I was pleasantly surprised. I liked the game and I want to try it again, perhaps it can even go up in my personal ratings.

The game rules are easy to teach, but as it allow for some deckbuilding it is very interesting. I’m still not sure about how the deckbuilding is done, but it seems similar to Android: Netrunner´s. I will read about it soon, for now I have only played with the pre constructed decks.

The gameplay offers interesting decisions forcing you to choose the element of the fight, the characters and supports. It seems very simple but I like it and I’m pretty sure it has lots of hidden depth (which I would love to explore). 

The art is great and I love the Tarot sized cards, the only issue is that sleeve them is much more expensive.

I bought most of the old sets in an auction and later that week FFG announced a reprint for the game (which I also bought). I’m still not sure about the differences of the editions or if it is worth to keep both copies of the game but I will find out soon. As I bought a lot of cards at the same time, it was hell to verify if the sets were complete. Now I know how to do it, but at that time it seemed very hard.

Bottom line, I’m mystified and intrigued by the game. I really want to play it again soon and I’m pretty sure is rating will improve with more plays. I think it is a good two player game but I need more plays to verify it. 

Current Rating: 6.5

This game grows on you the more you play. It's a great feel of a CCG (collectible card game) and saves you money in the long run.

I've been enjoying it and look forward to playing it more now that I'm introducing more players to it.

My record at losing when I teach is still intact! :)

This is a game that rewards multiple plays. You'll need to learn your cards and then, like many Knizia games, it starts to open up and you see combos and interactions.

Each deck has a different style of play and over all, I really just enjoy it. Part hand management, part "no guts, no glory", part push your luck.

Quick play and it gets better each time I play.

RATING: 5
This is the first of Kosmos' 2-player line of games that really did not "grab" me... and that includes Crocodile Pool Party!

The two play decks included in the basic game (Hoax and Vulca) are not very balanced... I think that the Hoax have won only 3 of the games I've played.  So guess what... I have to pump more money into the game to make it playable.

People are saying that the 'deck building' aspect is where all the fun is... which is what I was trying to avoid!  The stand-alone decks do not appear to be very well balanced, so you almost have to play with customised decks... and the 60 cards included in the basic set are definitely NOT enough.

I like the game system.  I like the way the game flows and there are some strategies that you can employ with even the basic decks.  But, couldn't they have balanced the decks a little bit?  Or made them larger?  30 cards doesn't seem to be enough.  And the Hoax lose 80 % of the time... not fun at all.

It would have been better if they put all 330 cards in one box... made it a "constructable" game and left it at that!

A pathetic attempt to cash in on the CCG market without the collectibility.  I expected more from Reiner Knizia.

I should have passed.

RATING: 8
Pseudo-M:tG fighting (bidding) 2-player tactical card game of hand management w/o the CCG baggage.  Pleasantly impressed with my first few games as BM plays much better than the instructions read.  Familiarity with the card text of your race/deck as well as your opponents is a must as this game has much more depth than its' initial impression (though unfortunately there's nothing really new here for the experienced M:tG player).  The board and dragons are not necessary, making each stand-alone deck of cards entirely portable as is.

Expansions owned:  All to date. 

Update:  After having played through several of the self contained and uniquely varied expansion decks, I'm increasing my rating from 7 to 8.  This will most likely increase further with more play.

With only two games under the belt I am very fond of this game. I have not yet discovered how the hoax will beat the vulca(?) but I'm sure with adequate play subtle play will reveal itself.

With all the expansions and the ability to build decks I have hardly scratched the surface of blue moon and I like what I've seen.

RATING: 9
My favorite 2-player game once you've got all the different races.  Loads of replay and the different decks each have their own unique flavor.  Can't get enough!  While I did get all the decks, I'm doubtful I'll ever get into deck building as I simply don't think the game needs it. 

Vulca- Another pretty straightforward power deck like the Terrah, but for some reason infinitely more fun to play.  Vulca don't seem to like the game to drag on and prefer to burn their opponents down pretty quickly.  Complete with some major support cards, you come out with a pretty decent deck and a great race for players starting out.  

Hoax- As their name implies, these guys are all about "tricksies" as Smeagol would put it.  Easily one of my favorite decks as they have probably the best special text of any of the natural decks and an unrivaled dominance in support options.  For as old and wrinkly as these guys look, they're loaded for bear.

Rated 9 only because deck balance overall isn't quite there.

RATING: 8
An entertaining, sometimes intense and sometimes frustrating game of dueling. Artwork is great on the two base decks, the gameplay is smooth for the most part, and you really feel like you've done something when you've won (especially with the Hoax versus the Vulca). The base-set matchup is a little uneven, at least for relative beginners, as the Hoax requires a little more dexterity and planning to play. Terrah vs. Hoax would probably have been a clearer straight-up bashfest, but it would probably have given the wrong impression about the game. This game is well worth the time to master, and playing well really will require mastery in the form of becoming familiar with your deck(s). See my review for more.

RATING: 8
It's probably too early to give this a fair rating.  I've come into the game with different expectations than most.  I know that it takes a few plays to get into the game, and that familiarity with the decks is important.  If I didn't have that kind of commitment to the game, I might be tempted to walk away, but I can see how it will get more interesting as I play more.  I'm looking forward to doing so.

Traded away - just didn't think I'd be able to get the number of plays necessary to bring out the strategy.

Reacquired after FFG's expansion sale.  Now with the AI opponent I am getting a few more plays in and am beginning to appreciate (yet still not love) the system.

Update 11/10: After playing with Ryan the game finally clicked and I am beginning to see what people appreciate about the game.  Up to an 8 (from a 6).

A tug-of-war card game. Nice large cards, simple rules, great art. Its a good game, but for me, the game doesn't seem varied enough. Its a bit too simple for my tastes, with no complexity to it. [Note: Base game only]

The art is fantastic and components are great though.

Really quite a surprisingly enjoyable game. I can see the comparisons with M:tG but it has a greater completeness than M:tG due to it's lack of collectibility. The game isn't quite as quick as on the box but it is nevertheless a pretty speedy game  with some large amounts of fun packed in. Consider the cost of the extra decks as the original two decks might bore you after a while.

TRADE: I would like to complete my collection through trading, perhaps even double everything.

Upon first inspection I thought Blue Moon was a simpler Magic the Gathering. But further plays have made me come to love this as the amazing deck management game that it is. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Blue Moon is not a terribly complicated game at its core. You have a hand of cards with values in two currencies. In each round, you play one or more of them to match an escalating power requirement, then draw new ones. Special card types and abilities provide exceptions to all of the above and can make you overspend or underspend. If you find you can't keep up using the cards you draw, you may or must drop out of the fight, which is less costly if you do it early. A tug-of-war track disguised as some plastic dragons shows who's currently ahead; you prevail by making consistent efficiency gains and/or a few lucky gambles.

The game is often compared to Magic, but it's not a comparison that is very fair nor does Blue Moon any favours. This game is more like the framework of a mathy German card game festooned with Magic-like tricks and effects. In aspects like player expression, design space, narrative flow or sheer game space, Blue Moon just can't begin to compete with Magic, and as a number exercise it can't compete with for instance Lost Cities or Schotten-Totten. I can see how people primarily interested in one side or the other might think this is a successful hybrid, but for me it's not exciting in either regard.

Selling six of the first eight decks as expansions is a bit nefarious considering they were clearly part of the original design and if you like the game you would have wanted them all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of the best 2 player games out there.  Too bad multiplayer rules cannot be constructed for this fine game.  A real treat for CCGs like myself that are tired of spending top dollar month after month.  Each set of expansions also has its own wonderful feel and changes how you approach winning.
Only thing I have not done yet, is try constructing my own decks, mixing sets/races, etc.  I am not overly interested in doing taht, however.

Based on 70+ matches (well over 150 individual games).  Quick-paced, with plenty of opportunity for clever card play.  I find that while the deck-building is more involved in Magic et al., the actual gameplay of Blue Moon is much deeper.  After countless matches, my interest in the game (and the many various ways to play) is as great as ever.  As former CCG junkie, it really hits the spot - without requiring me to take on a second job to finance the habit.

The first couple of plays feel like you're playing war with a hand to choose from.  Then around the 3 or 4 play something clicks.  You're familiar with the decks and you start making long range plans.  It's very satisfying to pull off a win as planned (and sufficiently challenging).  Extremely enjoyable.

This review refers to the base game only.  In other words, it's a lot of fun even with out the additional decks.

Based on one play.  This didn't really do anything for me.  Play a card, counter a card, etc., etc.  Eh.  I could see the cards getting old after a few plays.  I'd be willing to play it again to give it another try (it's not a bad game).  My rating could go from a four up to a five.  There are other cards sets you can buy to vary the game which doesn't seem bad (it's not like a CCG) but it would probably have been better if they included at least a couple other sets in the original game.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable, and finite, card game.  We have all the decks (highly recommended).  It's everything I wanted MtG to be, e.g. a card game that didn't require an obsession to do well with or enjoy.  The hold or fold aspect is very well done, but the game inevitably lacks the "joy of discovery" aspect of MtG (along with its horrible cost). Cardplay is more important than deck-building, almost the opposite of MtG.

Brilliant 2 player game. Am new to gaming generally and think this is a very good game. Some luck yes, but a lot of thinking required to make the most of your deck of cards. 

Played the first decks extensivelty.  Just finally managed to get hold of Khind and Terrah so beginning to play them.

Khind seem a 'weakish' deck whilst Terrah are another power deck like Vulca.

Done some deck building as well using the initial 4 decks released.

Infinite variations.

Top game. Recommend it a lot with my limited game knowledge !

Nothing wrong with this one really just didn't grab us enough to go back to it.  Owned all the expansions and promos.  Now you can just get those all together in Blue Moon Legends.  Love the art and the gameplay was more clever than some let on.  But I prefer other games with numbered cards just a little more than this one.  Specifically ones with some spatial element to the card play.

You can play BM in 3 forms. The boxed set alone is a good basic 2 player card game rating 6.5 for me. Good buy, but just about average.
Adding the expansions races raises it to 7, but is more a waste of money considering the number of expansions.
However this game can also be played as a very good substitute for trading card games with advanced rules and all (or at least many) expansions. If you every wanted to get a TCG, but feared that it will be a money pit BM migth be what you are looking for. Just make sure you get at least some expansions - the base game doesn't provide the TCG feeling for me.
Another excellent aspect of the game is the balance. As this is a closed gaming system all cards have been carefully balanced against each other. So you won't see any erratas or card bans or even unbalancing super cards.

However the more we play this game the more and more I appreciate and realize the great capacity for quick on the fly strategy.  More to this game than meets the eye. I believe that many of the lower ratings reflect people never really "getting" the strategy this title has to offer.  Oh yeah and the cards are beautiful.

Blue Moon is a quick two player card game where each player plays a different deck in a battle for superiority. The asymmetrical nature is fun and there are interesting decisions during play to make the game fairly engaging, however without any expansions I think the game is just OK and gets old fast. The expansion decks have some intriguing twists though and having just a few of them added into the mix really adds a lot of value. Each deck has its own strengths and weakness and the way you play each deck also needs to adjust based on which deck you are playing against. With a few extra decks in the mix there is really a lot to explore and plenty of variety and replay value in this fun and dynamic game.

One game is too early to see all the clever balancing done in this game so I can see why people rate this game highly ...

But it would take some investment (time ) to learn how to play. Dominion even if only played once in a while doesn't have that problem. there is acting and counteracting. Here you don't know what your opponent is going to do at all or what you can do if you don't know the cards in the draw deck. 

Dutch rules are very poor. Your opponent is described as you (while it is obviously not you)

Only one play so far, with the burrito boy; he hated it, because he felt like "I had all the good cards."  (He was the Hoax, I was the Vulca; if I'd read anything here before playing it, I would have had him be the Vulca.)  I can't say I was that crazy about it myself, but I definitely want to give it a few more tries.

Update: meh.  Playing this with a friend, we actually had more fun with Lost Cities.  This might be better if you play it enough to have a better understanding of the strengths & weaknesses of each deck, but I'm just not that interested in doing that.

[2007.Apr.12] Blue Moon (including the additional expansions) is a well-tuned card game. Although the rules can be learned in a relatively short timeframe (~20-30 minutes), actually mastering the game takes much longer. The "fixed deck" aspect of the game is a plus--no deck construction necessary. (Note, you may tweak you own deck if you own additional expansions--but this is not necessary.) The fixed decks are well balanced and play well against one another. Each deck's flavor is quite different, allowing for various strategies and playing styles. However, in order to play Blue Moon well, you have to spend some time learning the capabilities of each fixed deck (in the basic boxed set, there are 2 different decks). Nevertheless, the basic boxed set is a bargain for the hours of play you get from it. {8}

[2 plays, base set + Mimix]

Relatively light, enjoyable "war" game, but with variable player powers, a hand to choose from, and combos.  Maybe I'll start seeing more depth in this game after more than 1 play.

It is nice to have 30 different cards to choose from: each one of them has a kind of individuality that makes it all the more precious.

I also enjoyed benefiting from the occasional twist of fate that saves an otherwise desperate situation: it feels good to have luck on one's side.  Of course, the same applies to your opponent, so the luck factor is smeared over a few fights.

As regards to the obvious comparison with its older cousin Scarab Lords, I'd say that the two games play quite differently, despite their common reliance on variable player powers:

- In Scarab Lords, you progressively conquer or lose different areas of society (economic power, etc.), that each bring a specific kind of reward; the areas where you dominate slowly change during the game, which brings more tension than in Blue Moon ("I've got to get the religious power back in lower Hekumet").  In Blue Moon, the game play is made of a succession of fights, with little variations in the goal of the fight (usually: "I must win this fight").  In Scarab Lords, your strategy generally changes during a single game, which I appreciate.

- It is also quite frustrating, in Blue Moon, to spend 15 minutes playing and reach a state where all three dragons are back in the neutral zone; in contrast, the area of domination, in Scarab Lords, generally belong to one of the players: this gives a greater sense of achievement.

We got this in a trade and snagged several of the expansion decks as well (Mimix, Flit, Khind, Terrah, and Bukah Invasion).  Blue Moon has worked very well so far---we really enjoy the duel aspect.  At first glance, it can look like an overproduced variant of War, but on deeper inspection, the game involves a lot of hand management.  It often feels like a tennis match where you have to try and hold your serve for each point.    For such simple rules, each deck plays differently and thematically and you have to learn how the different cards interact---once you start to figure it out, it feels very satisfying.  I also appreciate the theme and that it's more than another Tolkien/D&D clone (somewhat surprisingly, my wife even enjoys it and gets a kick out of the Khind names and artwork, her favorite deck so far).  

We played this over again when we first got it, to the point where we've probably overplayed it and my wife is burned out on it.  Hopefully after letting it rest for a little, we can bring it back out again.

After 2 plays: Looks very promising. Only played with the base set, but will try out the 4 extra factions I have as well. This could go up after more plays.

After 15 plays with base game plus Terra/Flit/Khind/Mimix: upgraded to 8.5. Pillar/Aqua/Emiss I and II are underways. This could go further up.

After 30 plays with all expansions upgraded to 9. Excellent game. Only Emissary I/II don't strike quite home yet. The "regular" peoples' expansions are quite sufficient at this point in time.

50+ plays, just with the standard decks, and still going strong. Truly excellent game.

I think a real good game because mix the usual depth of Knizia games with a real good theme. The art of the cards is beautiful and the races are all (also the ones in the expansions) nice and quite well balanced. The game is a good strategic game and for winning a player need to use well his cards. the luck is not prominent.

I've bumped my rating up after many replays... this is a great game!  Lot's of replayability, great balance.  Unfortunately, you can't get a good feel for this if you only play a few times... it's not a "try-it" kind of game.  Plenty of tactics and subtletly here that isn't immediately apparent.  While it seems that the Vulca are much stronger than the Hoax, after a few plays the balance becomes more obvious.  I also enjoy the expansions!  Super value!

Very good game. My wife love it at the first instant. It just become her favourite 2 players card game, in the same league as Lost cities and Odin's Raven. I like it very much as well. The rating may go up to a 10 for us. 
Update: after a few more play on the base game, we feel that this is the game for us. We always like to play it, always want to play it.
(We have terrah, flit, mimix, khind expansion, not played yet.)
A perfect 10 for us!

Comments entered on 28 Jan 2010:

Blue Moon was a game that offers the same kind of strategic decisions that occur in Magic: The Gathering. The gameplay is quite different, but it also consists of a duel between two players. There is a pretty deep level of strategy involved in attempting to dominate to gain dragons while mitigating losses and preventing the loss of dragons.

I purchased three copies of the base game and each of the expansions.

I just don't see the hype over this game. I'm trying though, and will beat my head over it a bunch more times. My current rating of '6' is very generous at this point. I *believe* I should like this *at least* a 6, and probably more. But at this point I really see this as a '5' or less. Will keep trying - wish me luck!

[2010] Oh, but I am now beginning to get this, after our last foray. The rules suck. I see this rating rising with a bullet.

After a few plays I started to see the depth.  Each deck has its own strengths and weaknesses and requires its own playing style.  I was hoping Blue Moon would be a deep and interesting card game.  It has delivered.  Rating: 8

UPDATE:  I've been playing this much more recently and have begun deckbuilding, which takes the game to a whole new level.  I am having so much fun with this game right now, and I see a whole lot more in my future.  There is almost endless replayability and so many different types of decks to try.  Get your feet wet with the preconstructed decks, and then go full force with the Inquisitors (from the Allies & Emissaries decks).

Fantastic NON-Colectible card game. Tons of strategy under what had appeared at first glance to be a stripped down exterior.

All the good stuff I liked about ccgs, without almost any of the stuff I didn't. Add to that fantastic balancing, high production values, and wonderful art direction. 

Some of the names are a bit unpronouncable and some of the others are groan inducingly comical as well as down right awful. Though if that's the game's only shortcoming, I see no shortcomings.

 While I also wish I could find card sleeves for the oversized cards, I wouldn't wish the cards to be smaller just to accomodate
being able to protect them. 

The Vulca and Mimix are wonderful decks, though it is not necessary to buy the base set, as all other decks can work independantly, given you already know the rules and can produce 3 proxies for the dragons.

It is worth it to buy all the decks, as you can then play the "Consolidated" versions fo each deck, by returning the scattered cards of other races from the base deck they are in, over to the race deck the "belong" in.

Deckbuilding with the Emissaries and Inquisitors packs should be something very fun when I get around to it.

I highly recommend this game to anyone.

An interesting take on the "CCG feel for the NCCG."  I think Jambo might have hit a slightly sweeter spot for me, as the combos work more naturally, and you actually leave things in front of you to tap.  But Blue Moon definitely comes next in line, with the battle theme and exciting game play.  It really is a fancy auction in disguise, though.

Very fun and strategic game that plays quickly but has lots of possibilities. This game is all about tactics, cunning and thinking ahead.

People who are complaining about lack of variety or too much luck obviously haven't played the game enough. The possibilities are amazing, especially with all the decks available now.

Every deck has a totally different basic strategy to it. With deckbuilding you can make some very interesting combo's.

Fantastic game, which I didn't get when it came out because I was wary of its piecemeal form of publication (having spent too much money already on MTG).

Do try Keldon Jones' wonderful PC-conversion if you are at all interested in this game.

We really didn't like this game very much, although I liked it more than my wife. We really just don't like this style of game - too many different cards and too many different interactions. In addition, the special instructions on many of the cards are hard to interpret - more detailed instructions would have been nice.

Neither of us particularly liked the fantasy theme either. The drawings were distracting and we couldn't pronounce the names on the cards.

Blue Moon may look less deep than a ccg, but thats because the strategies are more subtle . I like the feel of the game. It has great artwork. The expansions adds a lot to the game. Also Deck building looks interested.

You must buy this game!

Bumped from a 8 ,the expansion adds a lot of replay value .

This game rocks. I agree with the others who have said that it scratches the MtG itch.

I never tire of this game. There are so many deck match ups to explore.

I was going to sell the original Blue Moon set and keep Blue Moon Legends, but after playing the new set, I saw how vastly superior the original is. It has larger cards (which makes the beautiful art much more visible), better type and sized font on the cards and board, and the icons are easier to detect and interpret. The only thing Legends has over the original is the fancy plastic dragons and that you get everything in one box for a low price.

Blue Moon appeals to the CCG-loving part of me, as well as to the I-can't-afford-to-spend-$1000-on-a-CCG part of me (sidenote:  I can't afford $1000 on a CCG because I've spent WAY more than that on HeroScape).  Excellent dueling card game.  The expansions and the option to customize your deck keep the game fresh.  

If you're just starting out, I would recommend the starter set plus 2 other peoples, to try things out.  I like the Aqua and the Khind would be great decks to pick up.  The Aqua are a beautifully balanced deck with some nice protected cards and free cards.  The Khind are fun because they play so differently than the others, what with their gangs.  But any 2 of the other 6 peoples would add to your gameplay. (You'll probably end up getting all the expansions in the end!)  

The Emissaries & Inquisitors are an excellent addition, particularly if you're considering building your own decks.

A very interesting game, but it needs a least two extra decks to play.  I don't find the hoax/vulca fight to be very interesting (and would only rate that game a 7), but against other decks and other decks against each other, this game is fantastic.  Will I get bored of it?  Maybe, but if my interests last until I get into deck building, I suspect my enthusiasm will increase even more.  This is a very cool game, and amazingly simple, all things considered.  I now own all the expansions, but have not tried either of the E&I decks.

2p, 30m.  One of the guys got the base game, and I liked playing it so much I bought one of the expansion decks: The Terrah.
This game is fairly simple on the surface, but the card interactions and tactical choices can be fun challenges.
And not just interactions within your own deck, but also with your opponent's.  The "5 crystal" tournament-style scoring actually is good to encourage you to play beyond one or two hands, which helps you to discover effective countermeasures, and correct perceived imbalances with alternative tactical plans.  For some reason I think of it as a lighter San Juan.  Everything with card interaction is like San Juan to me, which is silly.  Maybe for others MtG is the standard.

I only recently realized how brilliant this game really is. A game against my girlfriend was about to start, though I was somewhat hesitant to play. The initial deal left much to be desired, and it all seemed pretty lackluster. But after  the first few cards, everything fell into place and the game (again) sucked me in completely. Even if you are not overly familiar with the preconstructed decks, there are always enough opportunities for good tactical play.
This game oozes the hard work the good doctor (and his playtesters) has put into it.

It's okay.  But I have both Race for the Galaxy and Roma, one of which will scratch the confrontational-cardgame itch better.

I gave it away.  I have better games than this so it never hits the table.  I'd play it again if someone else requested it though.

RATING: 9
Dueling card game of unparalelled simplicity and depth: a masterpiece of game design. Decepively simple this game is all but impossible to describe in a way that doesn't make it sound underwhelming, yet it is one of the rare speciments where design, function and intent comes together in radient harmony. Perhaps Knizia's best design. This even goes through the components, with a minimal game board, which is more a player aid, and oversized cards with a surprising lack of information, which makes them pleasant to handle, a joy to behold, and instant to overview. 

**So be warned, this description will make this gem seem simple where it actually is exactly as complex as it needs be for enormous depth and richness!**

Each player choose a faction, one player starts a fight selecting either the element "fire" or "earth", of which every card has varying strengths in, and plays one or a combination of cards, which the opponent has to match or surpass or retreat from the battle. If he matches, then the original player must now in turn overcome, replacing some or all of his previous cards, or retreat. The winning player attracts one of three victory markers from the board or the opponent. When all three and an additional one are attracted to one player he wins. If one player has no more cards and must retreat the player with most victory point marker wins. That's it. 

Glorious artwork, wonderful design, great flow, outstanding design. It is a bloody shame FFG discountinued this sublime game.

After a half a dozen plays, I like this game. It plays fast and there are usually plenty of difficult decisions to make. The artwork is not bad and the over-sized cards really add to the presentation. I have only played with a few of the races, but I like the challenge of figuring out how to beat different decks.

Update: I still like the game, and I've just begun to scratch the surface of it, but it seems a little anticlimactic. Or, I should say, every 2 or 3 games seems this way. Maybe when I get a little more experienced.

Update: Still rated at 7.5 but resorting to play AI.

This game is great! It has excellently balanced races with cards that maintain a certain feel for what the race is supposed to be like. When playing a deck I don't feel like the game is simple me playing a 5 and them beating that with a 6 - I feel like the deck I'm playing really represents a culture. Good game for my wife as well - as long as I don't play the Flit ;)

Played three times.  Vulca vs. Hoax.  Not heavy, not totally light -- mid-weight.  Doesn't have the staying power of its heavier ancestor Magic (even if only using a few preconstructed decks).  Pros: Very good for non-gamers.  Nice big cards make for bigger pictures.  The art is superb!  The art across each deck does well to carry its theme.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Gorgeous art, ok game. I've seen the comments about hand management, but I don't really get it. The first couple of dragons are actually worth 2 dragons (because your opponent will have to win 2 hands to get it away from you and win it to himself), so the importance of your initial hand is paramount. While there is some opportunity for teasing your opponent out of his good cards, bailing out, and then winning a couple of hands with the good cards you didn't spend, they are limited as most cards in the decks are very good. It's pretty much an all-out battle for each and every dragon. Would like to build my own deck. Very tactical, some limited bluffing. Not bad, but I kept having the feeling that this could've been great. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Knizia combines his Battleline design (again!) with a non-collectable CCG??  There seems to be a nice balance and consistent theme between each of the decks.  Recommended for people who enjoy CCGs but don't want to shell-out their life time savings.  Cool art.  UPDATE: knocked down 1/2 point as this doesn't get played too often.

Very pretty, but I'm just not that interested in having a series of fights. There's a lot of dressing that doesn't quite hide the fact that all the decision-making I'm going to have is picking a card out of my hand that's higher than my opponent's card. Yeah, deck-building, right. That's going to happen.

Played again, this time remembering the "played 6 cards = 2 won dragons" rule.

Well designed of course but I'm rarely in the mood for it since I've never had a ccg itch to scratch.  It's an ok 30 minute diversion.

Still, I'll keep it around for now because I think 'maybe someday' it'll work for me and I'll delve into it properly with gusto.

This game is similar to Magic the Gathering, but the unique combat mechanism (and non-CCG aspect) makes this game much more appealing to me.  The art is beautiful.  However, I'm a bit concerned that the game would be best played by memorizing the cards in each deck and then card-counting throughout the game, which isn't something I enjoy doing.

2010-04: This one underperformed for me, I'm taking it off my wishlist after a couple of plays. My major gripe is with the theme and I would definitely have enjoyed this more with a different theme.

Everyone that I have introduced this game to has hated it, which leads me to believe that I am the worst person who has ever taught a game.

Easy, fast, fun. The world is interesting; I'm glad they didn't take the standard fantasy route. A good mix of CCG and eurogame, best of both worlds, pretty much.

RATING: 9
Rich, deep, beautifully conceived game; gladly bought all nine expansion decks. Have played quite a bit, but feel like I've barely scratched the game's surface on the pre-constructed people vs. people front, and have yet to try any deck building, adding in Allies, or dealing with the Buka invasion! Not crazy about the fantasy theme, but what else could it be? Favorite peoples: love Hoax, also like Khind, Mimix, Aqua, Flit. Can't seem to win with the Flit, will keep trying. [more than 41 single-hand plays]

RATING: 3
Took me a couple of plays to really understand how it works, and it is ridiculously basic, but it still felt like the good ol' CCG days, and I enjoyed it. Still, in the end, it's just another compete by playing the highest number in a particular suit game. Think I will stick to Lost Cities.

RATING: 9
This is an addictive, colorful, clever, and brilliant conception. I am continually amazed at Knizia's breadth of expression. The card play and hand management is absolutely wonderful. The artistry of the game is surprisingly fun. As an abstract game lover, I usually am more attracted to the elegance of signs and symbols (Ingenious, for example) but the atmosphere of this game is remarkably engaging. I tend to play this game obsessively for a month at a time and then return to it about six months later.

Wonderful two player game.  Gets better with additional play and each expansion, the combos and knowing your deck/opponents' deck can really result in very clever card plays and interesting decisions.  The base game is somewhat limited even though there is already a lot of depth in it.  One of my favourite 2-player games ever.  The rating reflect the whole set, whereas with the base set will only get roughly 7 to 7.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First things first, now that [boardgame=147154]Blue Moon Legends[/boardgame] is out, there's little reason to consider this, unless you really like the tarot format or are a collector.

My rating is based on playing the Vulca and Hoax decks from Blue Moon Legends. The Vulca deck is excellent for beginners, but I can see how they would become quickly dull for more experienced players. While it's a competitive deck, it's not that tough to play. In contrast, the Hoax take a little getting used to but ultimately hold up very well. Played right, they'll prepare you for anything. They seem especially potent with the Buka and Hyla Emissaries. I played these guys nearly twenty times in a row, gradually getting better, and still am not sick of them. They present a challenge every time.

I like fantasy themes, but the fantasy theme in this game doesn't grip me.  Artwork is good quality, though.

The gameplay is nice enough.  There are some meaningful decisions.  You have to work with the luck of the draw and conserve resources and make your opponent waste his.

The pre-built decks aren't all that balanced, but the construction rules allow you to make custom decks.  Every race has a viable custom deck, so there is depth to the strategy in the game.

Overall it's just kinda okay.  I rated it low because I don't really have fun playing it.  I don't get to make a goblin deck full of explosions.  No matter how extreme I make a deck the same basic strategy applies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8

The game is fun and each deck adds something new to the game.
I really like this as there is so many options to play the game, with deck matchups, added leaders, diy decks etc etc.

There is plenty of game just with the 8 basic preassembled decks to enjoy.

Make sure to download the FAQ and read the rules a few times to get them all right.

Probably my favorite game as of right now and I am pretty much always willing to play.

RATING: 6
There was something fun and equally annoying about this game. Ahhh.. the times when I was about to take down my wife with a card and...she blocks me. Then you are looking at your hand for next turn going "oh man wtf do I do now?" Those decisions on whether to try and take somebody down quickly or let the cards on the table build up for a larger dragon reward, but each turn that goes by is another turn your opponent is drawing a card that may defeat your strategy. Traded it off mostly because of the 2 players only which doesn't seem to work out very well at our house. Had all the expansions too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Gorgeous presentation and smooth gameplay, but the luck factor is too high for my taste. I still play it from time to time, because I just love games with various factions and the artwork on some of the cards is simply stunning. However, in terms of pure gameplay there are often too few options, so You end up playing the cards that you get, and sometimes you feel like the game is playing itself. In spite of that it's a light and fun card game, and the aesthetic value is very high.

This is an awesome 2 player card game.  It has the feel of the ccg, without the issue of buying costly singles to complete your deck. 

Most of the expansions are prebuilt decks that offer plenty of new mechanics to keep game play fresh and exciting.  I'll be playing this one for a long time.

(On a side note, my wife can not get past the bizarre art to even try this one.  She has a low tolerance for fantasy themes, and this one did cross the line for her.)

Rating based on play with the two starter decks, the Hoax and Vulca. The art is excellent, but the game is average.

Достоинства:
1. Красивая. 2. Реграбельность огромная. 3. Глубокая.
Недостатки:
1. Абстрактная: так называемый "бой" - это попытка выложить в свой ход карты на равную или большую сумму очков, чем оппонент. Кто не может поддержать планку - проигрывает.
2. Нет ощущения прогресса, т.к. после очередного боя все карты со стола уходят в сброс. Хотя, стратегичность с таким подходом всё же имеется: например, необходимо думать, какие карты попридержать для следующих боёв. Иногда, стратегически верным решением будет специально слить бой, чтобы начать с чистого листа мочить оппонента.

Another purchase based on rave reviews.  I was disappointed that there are only 60 cards in the box. 
Fun so far, although the decks seemed a little unbalanced, although admittedly I haven't constucted my 'own' decks with them.

Balanced and somewhat fun, this game has grown on me after repeated playings.  I first thought the gameplay was too lightweight for my tastes, but that is not the case.  Good card management usually carries the game, despite the luck involved. The expansion packs make for deeper gameplay and replayability.  Update: I have played this a lot over the years but am less inclined to do so now.  It's a bit dry and the game tends to drag as the dragons move from player to board to player again.

RATING: 6.5
Two player card game by Knizia: With a 30 card deck, each turn is part of a fight, where you play leaders, characters, boosters, supporters and mutants. Winner of a fight attracts a dragon to their side (or puts the opponent's dragon back to the middle). Winner is the person with 4 dragons or runs the opponents out of cards. Cards have special abilities, much like Magic: the Gathering. Seems to be more fun than Scarab Lords, but only playing the basic decks (Hoax vs Vulca), I'm only lukewarm on the game. For basically two decks of cards, and some rules that aren't written particularly well, I don't think you get a lot of value for your money.

This is not deep or particularly daring as far as the CCG style genre goes, but it makes for a fast, fun pick-up-and-play game without all that selling the kids into slavery business. The stand alone decks are better in terms of depth, but this is the proper way to learn it. And it has the rules, so there you go. Good, simple, nicely themed fun.

Good game.  Great art.  Easy rules, but allow for a lot of strategy.  Critical hand management.  Have to know when to take a hit.  Fast paced.  Quick games.  All elements of a good game.  I like this one.  Not exceptionally deep, but is more of a filler game, but can be played as a light to medium full game.  Definitely one of those games where you have to know the cards, or you will suffer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played for colour and humour more than the enjoyment of the game mechanics themselves, I admit. "I play my gang of Khind; No Clue, No Brains and No Respect!" 

Update: Each deck has a different feel and strategy, and each encounter between races plays on those differences, creating unique tactics for each. Some familarity is needed to get an intuitive (or insanely computational) understanding of the nuances involved. But there ARE nuances. Me like. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't like CCG, but this is something else: first of all you don't need a lot of money (expansions have a fix number of cards). Second: each race has its own style and you have to adopt special strategies to win. Third: it is much fun to play, funnier IMO than Magic.

UPDATE
My taste has changed a bit with the years passing, so I am much less attracted to play games like this at the moment.

RATING: 10
Rating is based on the entire Blue Moon system and not just this base set.  The rating for the base set alone is 7.

The primary skills in this game are 1) staying flexible, 2) knowing when to retreat and 3) knowing how to time the endgame.  One of the more interesting things is that how these skills are used will vary depending not only on what deck you are playing but also what deck you are playing against.

The addition of the Emissaries and Inquisitors deck adds games within the game.  Not only are you in a competition to have dragons on your side at the end, but you are also playing sub-games of when to play Influence and Interference cards.  If my rating weren't already a 10, adding these cards to the mix would add a full point to my rating.

We both like this one. It solves the problem of the average CCG in that there is a limited amount of variation, and not an seemingly unlimited amount of cards in which you get lost. In my view, this is actually a strong point.

RATING: 5
As I'm a card-gamer and fan of the fantasy genre in general, I can't help but love this game.  In short, it's a Magic the Gathering that I can collect.

Update: 
Unfortunately, I don't get to consider it often since it is a 2-player game.

But when the chance arises, I immediately think about its limiting decks that tend to play better by themselves, with a definite focus and style.  So if I play Mimix vs Khind, I'd know exactly how each side would play, and I'd know that mixing either of them with anything else would dilute their individual effectiveness (since their unique abilities rely on playing more of their own cards). 

The official way of mixing them leads to deck-building and moon-counting (each card is worth so many moons) and I'd rather play something else that go through all that time and trouble.

I'm keeping Blue Moon because I simply love some of their art, but I got better 2-player games and I just don't see myself playing it often.  

Maybe once in a Blue Moon...heh.

Update 1:  It feels like this game has all the elements to be a great 2-player card game, but in the execution, it drags more than it thrills.  I think it is because you play till the deck runs out.  Sure, you can win the game by getting three dragons on your side, but that's difficult to do, because it usually becomes a tit-for-tat, I get a dragon, I lose a dragon, type of affair.

Pity.

You'll appreciate Blue Moon more after playing it a few times, and the expansion decks introduce more mechanics and add much more to the experience. I really like this even though I've yet to try the advanced deck-building rules. Don't give up if it hasn't clicked with you yet!

RATING: 7
(played with most races): Interesting game, one of the better two player games. Buying all the cards takes a toll on your wallet though... The game would benefit if you would play it more often or with the same opponent since it is quite important to know how decks work against each other and what are their weaknesses/strengths. I seem to play it only every other year and it doesn't work too well this way.

RATING: 9
A very good two-player dueling card game. The rules are a bit complex but reading the FAQ and Glossary helps in figuring out the kniziesque logic and card/effect precedences.

Needs the extra decks to keep the game fresh. OTOH, buying all the decks increases the total cost of the game way too much.

Both the artwork and the names of the cards vary greatly, both between and within the decks. On average, the quality is very good, though.

This one has really clicked now. An impressively well-balanced game and a must with the extra six races. After the first few plays, it's natural, surprisingly intense, and - thanks to the rich theme (yes, Knizia does do it sometimes) and whimsical characterisation - you actually find yourself getting emotionally involved with your cards. Scary.

Without a doubt, the best card art of any game out there, full stop. With eight different contributing artists, it's a rich, flavourful and immersive experience.

For the sake of reference and comparison with the other decks, I rate the Vulca as a disappointing 7 and the Hoax as a solid 8.

I was really heartbroken to give up my Blue Moon collection on trade, but I received an offer that I couldn't turn down.

This game really captures my imagination. I haven't rated it yet because I've been playing me vs. me so far. I mostly play it by myself since I'm having trouble getting other folks into it. In order to get the most out of the game, you must play several games with the same people sets and really get to know the cards. Ideally you would play once with one people, then switch and play with the other people, and then do this several times. It just isn't a game you can fully appreciate until you've played quite a few games. You also need to enjoy complex rule-interpretation situations. At first this can be daunting, but once you work through a few sticky situations you get the hang of it. The FAQ is also indispensable.

Really fun.  Played our first few games tonight.  I really enjoyed them although my 13yo son won all the games!  Perhaps I'm not quite bright.  I can see how the replayability would go down if there were no expansion decks.  

We have the Khind, Mimix, Flit and Pillar expansions, but I don't want to list them as a separate game as I feel that inflates my game count.

We played two games tonight with the base set of Vulca and Hoax and the Vulca won decisively. We switched decks and the same thing happened. So the Vulca seem a quite a bit stronger. We feel pretty sure that we played all the rules correctly (the rule book is very clear). So I will start my rating and the middle range of 5. Maybe after we try out the other two races, things may get better.

I'm still not sure why this is successful. We found it kinda dull; the decisions weren't that interesting - hold on for better card combos or play for now. Familiarisation with the sets will improve performance, but doesn't much change the nature of the decision making. Won't familiarisation lead to similar play from game to game with unchanged, small decks? It's not high on my list of games I want to splash out on expansions for.

A great 2-player game that can add a lot if you buy the expansions. The different people decks provide different strategies and give the game a high replayability. One of the best alternatives to the expensive CCGs out there.

- Pay attention to the rules since there are a few exceptions to basic rules due to people-specific abilities. Nevertheless easy to learn and quickly explained, can be played by anyone!

This game is very challenging and it is fun to try new combinations and decks against other players!
Very good! The playing time is short enough too! Finally I managed to get hold of all the expansions and will soon be starting in developing professional decks! This may give the game another kick! It was fun to play this game so many times just to test how each nation would fare against each other. I don't need Magic(crack)anymore... ;)
Update: WOW, when I first played this game, I almost rated it a 7! But decided to give it a 8! After 2 years I still pull it out very often and like to play it! Just check how many times I played this game and you understand why I gave it the final vote now! What a game! Knizia is my hero! ;)

The combination of depth, complexity and art creates a nice little world.  The [i]Blue Moon world[/i].  Whoo-hooo-hooo (fade-in theremin soundtrack).  I adore Blue Moon and its wonderfully weird peoples.  

It took me a while to get to this level of appreciation.  The ruleset is simple, but with many special situations and puzzling card powers. I kept going back to the rulebook, even after multiple sessions.  It was worth it. Not being a Magic player, I was not used to the dueling-deck format, and it took me a while to see the point. 

The deck you choose gives you strategic direction, and the cards you draw give you tactical opportunities.  This interplay of strategy and tactics is what makes the game far deeper and more re-playable than you would expect. Many games come down to a hair-finish endgame, decided by who has the better final hand, or a few more cards—obviously something to try to plan for. 

The ludicrous fantasy theme and half naked babes give you.. fantasy and half naked babes!  Enjoy the b-movie experience.

If you think Blue Moon is a matter of luck (this was my initial perception), download and play against the AI:

Playing this with all the decks has completely changed my opinion of this game. It's pretty awesome.

The Vulca are always fun, though. Power, power, power.

This is a collectable card game without the collectability and also without the depth, variety, and strategic options offered by many other CCGs.  I do understand the strategy of the basic game.  It is particularly amenable to card-counting as you decide what order to play support cards and whether to ladder your opponent with a succession of low power cards (in search of a cheap win or a good draw) or go for a big play immediately and risk not being able to continue the fight.  But this is elementary stuff.

I thought it seemed like a good little card game but my partner didn't like it as she felt she hardly had any options with the cards in her hand. I didn't mind it but could be because I won both times. I would like to play it again for a few more tries and switch decks. Picked it up in a math trade. Beautiful cards, cool concept, but wouldn't buy it brand new. There are many two player cards games we like much better - such as Battle Line or Babel.

Fantastic 2 player card game, with quite a lot of the feel of a CCG at only a fraction of the cost. Is perfectly playable by itself, or can be expanded with several pre-built decks representing additional peoples - some of which come with additional variants & optional rules.

There are rules for deck-building, although the original decks are fairly well-balanced.

WARNING: Although the artwork is awesome, the oversized cards can be annoying - and were previously impossible to find sleeves for if you play a lot & want to avoid wearing them out. But now FFG produce 'Tarot'-size sleeves which are a perfect fit, thanks! There is also a new complete edition due for release which supposedly has more standard-size cards.

Great game with very balanced decks. The only problem is the rules. Generally well written, but often things depend on a small sentence in the book. Not good enough. I prefer to play with the preconstructed decks.

RATING: 5
My rating is based on 2 plays. The game seems to have good mechanics/balance, but the execution is somewhat clunky and straight forward. I am willing to play more games because I suspect my liking towards it will increase once play becomes more fluid.

I'm not a fan of the CCG genre not only because of the marketing but also the knowledge of card effects to play well and the downtime involved in play reading and learning; neither am I into exploring fantasy worlds (I prefer the real world). But this is a Knizia design (my favourite designer) and it is highly regarded, so I had to give it a go. One play in, already there was a growing realisation of the thematic strength of the Vulca in the fire element. This seemingly biased problem in the game intrigued me as to how deal with it in the next game, and the fact there are only 30 cards in an Alien race to consider,this geek approach should be limited. Also this is a rare Euro game in which the game play is more involved then end of game scoring, always a plus for me. What is a nice touch is that you get a brief background to the Blue Moon mythology instead of it being forced onto you, and you learn more as you examine the alien cards text. The second game was quick, making it good candidate for lunchtime sessions with further exploration. However even with 30 cards the distribution is too detailed to be offputting for me to play with loved ones. Maybe the Blue Moon City game may make me revisit this card game.

Update - When I first played Blue Moon, I had been coming off MtG and other CCGs. This was just so much less. Now, years later (and many years from playing CCGs), I have come to appreciate the game for what it is. It is a very good game and for those who do not wish to indulge in the money pit that is a CCG, this is a good substitute.

Often the game depends too much on luck but then it is a card game. It is NOT a replacement for Magic. MtG is a much deeper and more complex game. Blue Moon is quick and easily understood. It is unique in that the cards played are removed at the end of each round versus the army builds of Magic et al. At its core, Blue Moon is based on a trick taking mechanism; the other CCG's are based on incremental hits. (I realize that Blue Moon is not supposed to be a CCG but with all of the expansions and special promo cards, the no-card-is-rare claim has fallen by the wayside.) The decks are fairly well balanced and so there is no advantage to buying all of the expansions except for the variety. However, as with any of the games in this genre (Magic, etc.) once hooked it will inevitably become a money pit. (The complete Blue Moon experience will cost $100 )

This is the best themed of all of the Knizia games. When I first encountered the game I was unimpressed. There are much better trick taking games that are far less expensive and less luck based. Knizia offers another card game system that is much closer to a CCG: the Lords series (Scarab, Minotaur Lords - and one published only in Germany). The Lords series offers an significantly tougher game with some real decisions. It is much better (and cheaper) than the Blue Moon series.

VERY nice game. I am very surprised that a two player game with fixed decks can be this fun. I've bought 2 extra decks. Mimix and Flit. They are very alike which was too bad. In both decks you can recycle a lot of cards, so can be dangerous if the game is tied in the endgame. Next I want the Khind.

RATING: 8
Two of my biggest gaming enthusiasms are Knizia and card-combo games so I was always going to love this. I picked up the base game plus Buka and Khind decks. Unfortunately my wife, who I do most of my 2-player gaming with, isn’t keen on the artwork and finds it a bit too confrontational so I’m not sure how much play it will get. But I can still get my fix against the excellent AI implementation.

2 plays - 30 minutes each

The two civ decks I played with seemed balanced but very different. While play was tight, it seemed to always come down to having a fist full of cards and none of them were viable. While I understand that was intended, it seems I should have more opportunities to know to withdraw rather than to discover I lost.

For me, a little masterpiece. Mechanics are good, simple and deep. The game NEEDS to be played a lot so as it NEEDS the expansion decks for a better (endless?) replayability.

The basic box is a bit overpriced for what it is (only two races) but the two basic decks are well balanced and the artwork is fantastic. I have all the available decks (both E&I too); all the people-decks seem very well balanced in spite they play very differently.

Blue Moon is not M:TG lite, but is its own beast. It certainly has TCG elements what with the themed decks, the deckbuilding possibilities, and the variety of card powers, but it feels like a new animal. It is streamlined and rewards clever play more than the construction of a killer deck. The artwork is nice but the background itself feels rather puerile. I am looking forward to completing my set.

This is a sweet card game that gives the feeling of playing a magic CCG type game, but without having to learn about a ton of different special powers on the cards. Each deck seems to have its own unique feel and beautiful artwork. The game play itself makes you really think about how to best use the cards in your deck, with man options for combos and counters to other people's cards. Very fun, simple, and quick game to play.

Great for those of you sick of the ccg marketing scheme.  It's got all the twists and turns you want in a ccg, and the mechanics are simple to learn. Games are quick and fun.  Deck construction is somewhat constrained by the rules (and non-existant with only the base set), unlike classic ccg's where 70% of the strategy is deck construction.  But I like this about it...you can worry about playing the game, not constructing your deck, and it allows non-gamers an easy entree into the game.  The seller, though, is the artwork.  It is simply a beautiful game to look at and play (Don't downplay the eye-candy...a good game with bad artwork can turn some off...this is a good game with good artwork.) **Upgrade from 8 to 9...realize that is probably the best card game I own, especially with all the expansions.

Based on one play (Mimix vs Vulca), this seemed shockingly unbalanced, and I would guess it is broken. Reading the excellent AI analysis thread confirmed my suspicions that the decks are not remotely balanced, and therefore the entire game fails at its critical premise. I loved the beautiful cards, and dig the fantasy element and art. Too bad the game's lack of balance overrides player strategies, skill, and reasonable luck.

why do people keep comparing this game to magic? this game is nothing like magic and only has superficial resemblances to magic. besides both being card games and both having fantasy themes, what else do these games have in common? answer: nothing. blue moon is more of a trick taking game dressed up as a ccg. which isn't to say that blue moon is a bad game. i need to play it more before i rate it, but this is a pretty good game

I've played basic Blue Moon with the races that come in the base set.  I enjoy the card management and the tug of war of the dragons.

I can't comment from a CCG veteran's perspective, as I've only ever spectated games and occasionally browsed some decks.

Will never turn down a game.

I really really like this game. Early on I had some doubts over the rules, but now I have a firm grasp. Played the basic set with wife and experimented with the first two expansions, the Mimix and the Flit.

Now that there is an AI I've played quite a bit and learned to appreciate the game. Haven't played MTG or any of the other CCGs, but this is certainly something. I would play this to death if I had someone to play with -- wife is still lukewarm towards the game.

This game had been on my wishlist for a while, but I knew it was long out of print, so when in the autumns of 2012 I saw that this was in stock at a game store run by someone we often game with, I jumped on the chance. Suffice to say that my wife (the only person I can regularly play 2p-only games with) was not too taken with the game, and now the game has been reprinted anyway, with all expansions in one box. (I picked up the Flit deck at the same time, and got a couple of promos thrown in, but none of the other decks were available.) Oh well - I actually think this could be a really good game, and it really appeals to me, but I know I'm basically never going to get to play it (it may be just as well, or I'd definitely have splashed out on the new reprint).

At first I was skeptical on whether or not Blue Moon would be varied and deep enough for me.  I mean, it only has 300 cards or so, compared to LotR TCG which has ten times as many.  However, playing with 5 decks so far has convinced me that it is deep enough, and even though I enjoy deckbuilding immensely I haven't felt the urge to tear up the incredible balance of them yet.  Two thumbs up!

A fantasy themed card game with relatively straightforward rules.  The base game is okay but could get a bit repetitive (I would rate it a 6 or 7).  Add a couple of expansion decks and the replayability skyrockets - particularly if you start building your own custom decks.  Also, most of the expansion decks are just cooler than the two in the base set.  (Each deck has its own theme, style of artwork and special abilities.)

Aesthetically, a beautiful game - big cards illustrated wonderfully (if, occasionally, creepily).

12-03-2014. Acceptable game,  in which you play through very rigid turns 'fighting' your opponent by playing a succession of increasing card values in order to win dragons (the first with 3 or most when decks run out wins).

It's a decent CCG-style game with some deckk building and  interesting interactions during play. Sadly, I would say that its been replaced. I do wonder why you would play this cardgame, while so many more/better card games are available.

Just doesn't seem interesting.  No tough decisions or tension.

This game has steadily climbed up the charts for me. I play it more and more, and like it more and more. I haven't even started building my own decks, and the base decks + Buka + E&I decks just add almost limitless replay.

can be fun, but as with all card games: if you want more variety you have to spend more money.  The two decks the game comes with get old fairly quickly.  But I like the system and it's good for beginners.  The larger cards are neat, too, and the artwork is pretty good.

art (ranges - to +) means how I like the graphic design in general, including if cards are easy to identify, if boosters and support are 
easy to tell apart from characters.

control (-- to +++) is most important to me. It values how well a player can control his own fate by picking certain cards from a pile, drawing extra cards, winning dragons, discarding unwanted cards, defending against attacks and so on.

devious (- to ++) means how well the deck is in attacking the other player like discarding open cards or preventing him from laying out certain cards.

unique (- to ++) denotes how special that race is compared to others in terms of abilities and also "feel".

total simply adds up + and -, and translates them to a BGG rating.

(note that the E&I decks use a different rating system)


Hoax: art + , control ++ , devious o , unique o , total +++ = 8.5

Vulca: art o , control o , devious + , unique - , total o = 7.0

RATING: 9
After many plays this is easily one of my favorite two player games. The give and take nature of the battles makes hand management and calculated retreats crucial to securing victory. Each deck is built around a particular mechanic making each one unique.
The decks are small enough that luck of the draw rarely feels like a factor in a loss/win.

Pretty cool early LCGish game from the good Dr. It's cool, but I feel it needs more of a devotion to learning how the decks work to be competitive. The Vulca deck will just hammer the Hoax deck into submission for two casual players, which is all I would be at this one. It's still pretty cool, though.

Can't imagine myself playing this game all that often.  I'm starting to see some of the strategies of this non-collectible card game.  I'm starting to think the fun of ccg's, however is the building of the deck and since these decks are basically pre-built, I'm not sure how fun this game is.

Nice components, but not a lot of game here. It's a simple press your luck game with a couple of MtG special powers thrown in. I like the fact that it's not a CCG, but I find it less compelling than, say, two Magic starters. The artwork, from the usually reliable Franz Vowinkel, is terrible. Stick to drawing renaissance traders, mate.

RATING: 7.5
A fast paced expandible card game that generates numerous comparisons to Magic: The Gathering. There is that familiar MTG "feel" when playing cards in combination, and a similarly themed fantasy world for the cards, but this is mostly a game about precarious hand management. A player wins automatically when he's ahead by 4 points; otherwise, whoever has the most points wins when someone runs out of cards. You get points ("dragons" actually) by winning fights. Each turn you either concede or continue a fight. To continue fighting, you must put up new cards that meet or beat your opponents cards. This is largely a mathematical exercise, where you're summing values, and sometimes doing a little multiplying, and comparing your result with your opponent's.

The game lacks that sort of "entrenched battle" sensation you might get from a Magic: The Gathering game, because with the exception of "support" cards, your fighters only last one turn. That is, you never add reinforcements to a battle, they're only replacements. It's a strange concept to work your mind around; why do characters "withdraw" (and that's not the same as you "retreating") and get replaced by other characters? This replacement MUST happen each time it's your turn, or you will lose the fight (that's retreating the battle), even if your active characters are already adequate to repel the attack. Because of this rapid change of cards, the game lacks the positionality of M:TG, where you could have several creature cards out there at once, fighting together, holding the line, and possible working in combination. Even if you play support cards, they'll only last for one fight (usually a few turns). Still, once you get to know your deck and the deck of your opponent, the hand management becomes a little easier.

I worry that after several more plays the game will be too easy, read: random and dull. We'll see, but I can imagine knocking a half a point or as much as a point from my rating after subsequent play. Blue Moon has some definite plus points and unique qualities to it. Fights take place either "in fire" or "in earth," and most cards have different values for fire/earth. Deciding which plane to fight on is an interesting mental exercise, as is deciding when to play one of your special cards that can change the plane mid-fight (normally the fight stays on the same plane).  The decks have interesting themes, and each seems to have its own best way to play it. The fact that it's NOT a CCG is a major plus if you're a reformed M:TG junkie like me who's happy not to spend a mint on a card game.

2-player card game that has mechanisms that resemble those from collectible card games, and has a distribution model that's halfway between CCG and expandable board game, but is just as bad as a CCG.

Blue Moon is all about duels, and it does them elegantly, Love the CCG feel and the customization. Nice 2-player filler. Still, the LCG distribution model means this game is pointless unless you have at least one rival to pit decks against. Also the distribution model rips you off, because each race deck is not complete, and you do need multiple decks if you want multiple copies of a card. You don't even get the complete race if you buy a race deck. At least CCG companies are up front about ripping you off.

Base: 3+3

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Hand Management. I'm very interested after my initial play. Feels like a cross between Condottiere and a fantasy CCG. I'd like to get more plays in, with the same decks and with alternate decks, before even thinking about customizing.

I have all the expansion decks from Tanga, but still need the base set, heh.

There's something addictive about Blue Moon! The games are fast, the system is elegant, and the decks are extremely well balanced. However, if I had to live out my days on a desert island with another person (I'd prefer a dessert island), and I could choose to either take Blue Moon or all my Magic cards, I would take Magic.

The benefits of Blue Moon are that it is easy for beginners to understand, it is very balanced, it is affordable, and it doesn't take much time. If you like Magic, but don't have time to fiddle with decks, you will *probably* enjoy Blue Moon. Further thoughts: a few more plays has seen the Blue Moon wane a bit (I know, bad pun). Granted, we are only playing with the base decks, but deck familiarity and tactical repetition are dragging the game down. Next time we want to play cards, we will probably play Magic. I still think Blue Moon is a good game, and the rules are very clean. As a system, it's rather elegantly balanced, and the see-saw action if fun.

Even further thoughts: this game is definitely worth owning, but just isn't going to see the table that often. My wife refers to it as "dumb Magic" - not as an insult, but simply as a way of explaining that it employs some similar mechanics (and is fun as a result) while managing to be a much simpler game. If you find the complexity of Magic exciting, Blue Moon can be a let-down (although in a world without Magic, I would likely acquire all the Blue Moon expansion decks and rate the game higher). Playing Blue Moon makes us want to play Magic, and in the end, I've found that the conflict resolution in Blue Moon is not as satisfying. Between well matched players, the victory seems to be a matter of luck. There is no room in the game to develop much of a different long term strategy, and so it is simple for two good players to consistently make optimal or near optimal decisions to "work the system". Winning is robbed of its excitement.

Unless I played the game wrong, I'm ranking it down here.  It seems to be a type of non-collectible card game where I need to memorize the opponents cards!?

The rules are not well laid out though and that added to intial difficulty learning the game.

Kétszemélyes kártyajáték, amiben két faj harcol meghatározott számú kártyával. Minden körben egy-egy karakter méri össze az erejét, akiket lehet erősíteni, illetve támogatni különböző lapokkal. Egy-egy csata addig tart, míg valamelyik fél nem tud már többet emelni az adott csata előtt eldöntött tűz vagy föld értékén a lapjainak. Az egyes lapok az értékeiken kívül különböző szöveges tulajdonsággal is rendelkezhetnek. A cél a 3 sárkány begyűjtése vagy lapelfogyás esetén több sárkány birtoklása. Egy menet maximum 4-0-ra nyerhető a 3 sárkánnyal, plussz a befejezéssel. Így minimum 2 nagyobb menetből áll egy játék. Ha korábban ismerem meg biztosan jobbra értékelném, de ma már annyi kétszemélyes játék van, aminél nem igazán érzem jobbnak, hogy nehéz jól megítélni Knizia 10 éves játékát. Az alapdoboz összesen két paklit tartalmaz és igazán csak kiegészítőkkel lesz nagy az újrajátszhatósága, de még így is úgy érzem egy-egy pakli elég gyorsan kiismerhető. Sokkal kevesebb változatosság van benne, mint pl. a Netrunnerben, igaz ott jóval több lap tartozik egy-egy szereplőhöz. Nem rossz játék a Blue Moon, de nem az én stílusom, nem nyűgözött le, de nehéz belekötni is, mert teljesen rendben működik.

I'm not a big fan of CCGs.  I just don't get excited about a bunch of crap to keep track of on a bunch of different cards.  Blue Moon is not like that.  There are certainly special cards, but mostly this is just a fun hand management numbers game.  Sure like any card game, if you draw a bad hand you are going to lose, but there is enough room here for superior play.  Overall I think this mostly is just biding time until you get the better card.

I had avoided this for a while for fear that it would be to simmilar to Scarab Lords (which I think is downright awful).  I'm glad that I finaly got the chance to see how different it is. That said I never have any real desire to play this, and compared to other similar games out there there isn't much of a reason to come back.

This was a clever game.   There was just enough complexity to make it interesting but not too much complexity.  After 8 or 9 expansions, I can't remember how many, the game died a natural death.   I think this is fine.   It expired at just the point it would have become untenable and over-complex.  Now, if you can get a hold of the different decks, you have a tidy, fun and intriguing world to explore.

RATING: 4
I've played a number of decks a number of times and it's undeniably clear to me: Blue Moon is not, and never will be, a CCG-replacement.

I was raised on the tense, tactical card-play of Magic: The Gathering, and Blue Moon offers neither the depth nor the customization that makes Magic so addictive. (To that end, deckbuilding is at best an afterthought in BM.) It's alright for around twenty minutes of light, trick-taking filler but it always leaves me wishing I had played Magic instead.

I guess that there should be some kind of tension in this, but I didn't think that the hand management was all that compelling and you are left with too few options to where it almost seems that it comes down to the luck of the draw.

I would first qualify my rating by saying that I have only played this with the decks straight out of the box. I do see a lot of potential with building custom decks, but have not done that as yet. When I think of this game, "War on steroids" always comes to mind!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like asymmetric 2p games and I like Knizia, so it's no surprise I like this. Blue Moon is a climbing game with special powers, playing like a cross between a CCG and poker. As in poker, the key is knowing when to fold. To know when to fold, you have to know both your deck and your opponent's, which means it's a game that rewards repeat play. My rating includes the expansions because a game like this hardly exists without them. Without the expansions, dock a couple of points and rank it just above average for the Kosmos line.

Wife will only play a "The Wire" variant I created... and I even think that was a bit of a waste of time now... :o(

Game's more tactical than strategic with the luck of the cards dictating a fair amount - (suppose the strategy comes with deck-building - which I've not got into at all - willing to admit that I've not had the full experience yet... but admit I'm not really willing to have the full experience, either).

Overall? Meh.

RATING: 6
While the play is very straightforward, there is a HUGE metagame going on here that is actually pretty deep.  I kind of ran out of steam on this one.  I think if you pick up the whole set and aquire a strong knowledge of all the cards it can be very rewarding.  However, I lack an opponent who is willing to be that committed to the game.  With the exception of Howe's LOTR work, the art is the most amazing fantasy work I have ever seen in a game.  The theme reminds me of China Mieville's Perdido Street Station, or maybe Barker's Imagica.

One of the greatest card games I've ever played.  The art is fantastic.  The oversized cards are fantastic.  The rules are great too.  Each deck has it's own uniqueness.  It definately gets the most plays in my house.

It took a few tries, but I'm really enjoying Blue Moon now.  It's a good, quick two-player duelling game.  I like how each deck has its own style, but they're all reasonably well balanced.  Mimix might be my personal favorite; my wife likes Khind and Vulca.

This is a pretty solid game that plays like a CCG, but doesn't have the random booster problem.  The mechanics are fairly decent, but like all CCG format games, just don't hold my attention over repeated plays.  The randomness of the card play is fun for me for a few plays, and then I don't need to see it again for months or years...and then I get a yearning to play again.  If it wasn't in such a small box, I probably would have traded it away by now.

Even more proof that card-based games, generally speaking, really aren't my cup of tea.  While the first play was a somewhat interesting experience, I don't have any interest in putting in the time to learn the subtleties of the game and the interaction of the cards.  Mind you, for a card game, the production value is excellent with huge, colourful cards (although the art work, which certainly grabbed my attention, didn't appeal to me at all) and cute little rubber dragons.  And admittedly I haven't played it enough to give it a truly fair rating, but I'm clearly not interested in doing so!  Game design: 3/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 5/10

Way too expensive to get the real game (all the decks).  Take away the fact that it will milk away your money, and you've got one of the best things going for two players.  Easy to learn, but with lots of variety and tough choices with both strategy and tactics, this game has everything I want for a two player game.  Simply put, I'm currently in love with it, and I want to play it all the time.

RATING: 7
[FFG 2004 edition] {Fantasy; fighting, deck-building, hand management} Blue Moon is a simple 2p hand-management game with great replayability.  It is exciting and enjoyable.  It is easy to learn.  It is not easy to master; I am still learning the potential of each people. 

The rulebook is great! It is colorful, clear and informative.  Thumb up.  The cards are ok but I prefer more descriptive text. 

FFG should include a small novel with Blue Moon similar to what Bambus Spieleverlag did for Bottle Imp and Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde.  This should increase the fun of the game by providing more background of the Blue Moon.

Vulca is a strong Fire fighter with balanced capability with certain functions hindering your opponent.

Hoax is a balanced people with functions hindering your opponent.

RATING: 8
Another one of my favorite games that I rarely get to play.  A great pick-up-and-play 2-player game that incorporates just the right amount of strategy, variety, and luck to make a game unfold differently each time.  Expandable but plays just fine right out of the box.  My main gripe is that the cards (though beautiful) are oversized, making them difficult to shuffle, which you must do quite frequently with some decks.

RATING: 7
I'm a big Magic fan though I barely ever play anymore.  This is a nice, far lighter, game that has some of the same benefits.  Haven't played my Buka deck yet.  Like the speed of a game.  Rating could go up as I haven't found much to dislike yet other than it feeling so simple compared to Magic.

Deck preference (to play with):

1.  Hoax
2.  Flit (I'm told these are frustrating to play against)
3.  Pillar
4.  Khind (infuriating to play against)
5.  Terrah  
6.  Aqua  
7.  Mimix
8.  Vulca   

The first three decks I give a 7-8, the last 5 I give about a 6.

RATING: 8
I'd heard that this was a CCG, but, while it has some elements in common with them, it's really more of a basic-game-plus-expansions deal.  I'm very impressed.  The decks that I played with seemed well balanced.  And while the dragon figurines and board aren't essential to gameplay they do add quite a bit to the overall flavor.  Here's hoping that Kosmos releases an edition of this game with all of the decks--sort of like the big crate version of Apples To Apples.

Not impressed.  Game play wasn't very interesting; I'd rather play Roma or Jambo (or any of several CCGs).  Out of the box, it seemed the Vulka outdo the Hoax.  That's only based on two plays.  First play, I had Vulka and Lisa never got a dragon.  Second play, she took Vulka and I never won a battle.  The Vulka had higher power cards, better special cards - the Hoax didn't seem to have any advantage at all!

For most of the gamers, this is waste of time and money. Play  bigger cards than your opponent, randomly quit to save your bigger cards. So where is the game?

Played 10+ times.  It's very clever and appears to be well balanced out of the box.  One opponent commented that it seemed to come down to luck of the draw.  I'm not sure if I totally agree.

Very enjoyable.  2006/06/10 Expansions owned: Mimix, Aqua, Khind, Terrah, Pillar, Flit, Allies, Blessings, Buka.

Played Keldon's AI as I kept hearing good things and a new FF edition is coming. I can't see the appeal. 

It's glorified War where all the strategy comes from learning the decks and how they interact. Without that knowledge you have no chance and any play is essentially random. I find the theme cheesy and so the art though well done does nothing but put me off.

I'd rather play something like Slapshot which at least has a party, take-that atmosphere or Saint Petersburg for a tight, competitive 2P game.

Do not want!

Does not ever get played, I have a few other 2p games waiting for their chance so the outlook seems to be not that good.

However, my son is just learning how to read and this might just be a great game to play with him.

This game is very well balanced because the decks are useful until the last card is drawn.  You have the ability to come back or at least lessen the blow of how many crystals your opponent gets.  The only problem we have is the running out of cards win.  That is no fun.  We either need to play better or find an alternate ending.

The Mimix
The Khind
The Terrah
Emissaries & Inquisitors; Blessings

I hate this game - but I really want to like it.

This game was able to drive me round the bend - and for this reason alone we had to sell it off.

It is a [person=2][/person] design, though heavily play tested by David Farquhar. It is a simple game of hand management with variable player powers thrown in or good measure.

Players take on the role of one of the peoples of [thing=9446][/thing] in their quest for dominance. Each people have their very own characteristics and special abilities. They are finely balanced against each other, though some decks are better against certain people, none are overpowered.

Through a series of battles, each player tries to win the support of the ruling elemental dragons of which there are three. Each battle is lead by character cards attacking the other player. Support cards can be played and stay in power throughout the entire battle, whereas booster cards are just that, they boost the current character.

Each player tries to force the other player to give by playing higher value cards and/ or combos. Sometimes you might want to forfeit in order to limit your loses. 

The game is over if any player manages to persuade all three dragons over to their side. It can go back and forth, as once a dragon has been lured to your side, it goes back to neutral ground, if the other player wins the next battle.

An alternate game ending is once players run out of cards to play.

The game is fast paced and can be played in any number of ways. We switched decks after the first game (once you have been through the entire deck).

There are many tactical considerations to make and requires a good knowledge of the inherent strength and weaknesses of each people (each deck).

Our problem is in this last bit. The game requires a commitment on the side of both players. A skilled player should win more often than the unskilled player. The effort demanded of the player is not something that we wanted to put in. It is further complicated by the fact that I have a hard time constantly shifting focus, never fully understanding what I am doing or why. The different aspects of the various decks and the need to learn and understand them in order to succeed stressed me out.

In hindsight, this might have been mitigated to some extent by sticking to the base people decks and playing them extensively in order to grasp the tactical and strategical avenues open to them.

As it were, the game left me overworked, stressed and in no way enjoying myself, rather frustrated instead and therefore it was ultimately sold off.

This leads me back to my opening statement. I can see the potential in the game and I can feel it calling me, but I also know that unless I resist I will be miserable for long periods of time. I felt no connection with the various people in the game, the theme eluded me and this further made holding my attention long enough to want to really sink my teeth into it even more difficult.

#----0----# 

En realidad no se por donde empezar, vengo de la CCG y este juego no se parece nada a un CCG que haya jugado. Primero, por que los jugadores tienen las “mismas” cartas y  no existe esa carta desequilibrante y que cuesta 200€, aquí por 10€ todos tenemos los mismo, todos los jugadores tienen las mismas barajas…

Blue Moon, tiene un sistema de mayorías, la forma de obtener los puntos es peculiar, y los poderes individuales de las cartas (texto que hacen que alguna regla se altere), la mecánica sencilla, al estar basado en pueblos cada uno con su propia estrategia de juego, la posibilidad de “modificar” los mazos, los pueblos que amplían al juego (espero que no sean más de 4 mazos al año, si no esto se convertiría en algo muy caro)...

Por cierto, el arte de las cartas es muy bueno, y gracias a que son cartas muy grandes, los dibujos adquieren un mayor protagonismo.

La única pega, que no existen fundas para las cartas. Ya que esta son muy grandes.

RATING: 6
Bottom line is I found Blue Moon disappointing. I was a Magic: The Gathering player from the very early days (my first decks were Beta) and I enjoyed and played the game for several years until getting fed up with the rules changes and speculators. Thus, I had high hopes that one of my favorite designers, Reiner Knizia, would have created a non-collectible game that had some of the same feel and challenge. Unfortunately, Blue Moon is rather simplistic, and I found myself bored playing - something that never happened with M:TG. Knizia's Scarab Lords and Minotaur Lords are a bit more interesting, however, and worth checking out even if Blue Moon disappoints.

Playing Blue Moon is just like playing war - with the added bonus of a headache....the game's title is about as often as I would want to play this.

To add insult to injury,  there apparently will be numerous expansions to follow - the prospect of which - gives me the dry heaves.

However,  whilst others were left to drool in anticipation, there was an expansion that soon garnered much interest with me - and in a hastily concocted trade - this banal muck was allowed to do it's own expanding.......clear across the country.

RATING: 9.5
(NH)

Letter Grade: A.  With all the decks, you have nearly infinite replayability in a system that already combines variable card powers, a CCG-similar feel, thematic design, quick play, and accessibility into a great game of tug-of-war.

I love several things about CCGs when played between two well-balanced decks.  Matches are exciting and unique and short, and can be tense when both players know both decks.  But I obsess over deck-building, constantly tinkering for better balance and effeciency, and it becomes far too much of a bother.  Wanted Blue Moon to provide the advantages of theme-heavy variable-text card play without the need for obsessive deck construction for balance.  Been pleased so far with several base-set plays, and my excitement level is still high (and should remain that way as we become familiar with the Vulca and Hoax and expand into other peoples).  The cards are beautiful and the base set is a great value.  

9/11/07: Up to 8.5 from 8.  One more base-set play tonight.  I really like this game and had to resist bumping it up a full point as we still haven't explored the expansions. 

03-12-08: My initial enthusiasm continues to deepen as we dig further into the expansion decks.  No sign of slow-down on this one.  

Christmas 2008: My Blue Moon collection is now complete.  Most-played decks are still the Vulca and Hoax, but all of them are unique and cool.

[05-08-09]: Old rating: 8.5.  New rating: 9.5.  My new rating system will decrease most ratings, but my appreciation for Blue Moon keeps going up.

RATING: 7
Excellent properties in that it plays fast, plays easy and doesn't take very much space (the board is really superfluous).  In terms of fun factor, there are other games I like better, but it has the solid feel of designer Dr. Knizia.

As an aside, I find the theme rather weird, and to be honest, dislike it.  I can't understand why Wogorathoras the Gloomy has 5 Fire while Subawuba the Boring has only 2 or whatever.

RATING: 7
Neat game.  Will probably rise with more experience.  Knowledge of whats in you deck, and the others is necessary for solid play.  Plus it helps lay traps, avoid traps, bluff and double bluff.  Has all the key components for a great 2 player card game.  Waiting for time to tell.  It is similar to a boxing match.  Trading punches until someone can land a knockout blow.  Unless of course, both players are jabbing.  Then its a judges decision.  Really good times, and good decisions to be had.  I'm just mad I'm going to have to buy all of the decks now, because I enjoy it.

Meh, walking away from it for a bit nothing really excites me to bring me back to it.  I think you need to play a ton of it, or not at all.

OK you have got to be kidding me. I've played this now 3 times and will never again in my life play it.  I've let 2 other people read the rules to be sure I'm playing it correctly.

Don't believe me, check out my wants I'll trade you for it. ----Too late someone grabbed my copy, I no longer own this horrible, horrible game.

RATING: 5
Disappointing card game after all of the Magic-lite descriptions. The decision-making possibilities were uninteresting and generally obvious. Perhaps investing enough time to try various decks and deck-building would yield the game's hidden intricacy, but after two plays I don't particularly want to play ever again.

Classic Knizia design that transcends its "War with special powers" roots to become something great.  The eight wildly different (and yet exquisitely balanced) decks make sure nothing ever feels stale, the card abilities are all interesting, and, most importantly, the decisions on when to retreat, and when to commit are constantly tense and exciting.

Maybe with the right decks or knowing the game more, this could be a great game, But, as we played, it was simply an underwhelming experience.

This feels like all the fun of M:tG without the life-sucking properties (even ignoring the wallet-sucking properties).

It seems to play like a very light CCG, like maybe Redemption around Prophets-era. It's alright, but maybe not enough going on for my tastes.

RATING: 6.25
Played this game frequently with my ex-boyfriend. It seems that the races can be unblanaced at times, as in one race just seems to be able to trample a specific other race. We were thinking of putting together a tourney so that the two of us could play each of the races against one another just to see what those overpowering matches were. Also seems as if a lot of the races depend on what cards you have at the time; the races that allow you to plow through the discard or the draw decks really seem to be able to pull some things out of their a**es sometimes.

Seems more complicated than its worth, I've played a number of games and came to the conclusion that the decks cannot possibly be well balanced.  You would have to play only Blue Moon for years to become well aware of the complexities and inter-relationships in all the card decks, and how to properly play one deck against another. (Then again, why do you need to do that? Just play and see what happens.) I think of this as "Twilight Imperium - The Card Game"

Really do like this game. As with all card games of this type you have the occasional problem with the card text seeming self explanatory only to find that its a lot deeper and more flexible than you thought. However it is nothing like the rules lawyer heaven of Magic,much better pace, much easier to play/learn/understand and for me much better fun. Like the scoring system very much, dont like loosing to 15yr old daughter at all. All in all its a great cheap game,take it on holiday play it in 30 mins or so, excellent.

Played at least 50 times. Nice tactical filler that can be played in 30 minutes. Better as players are more experienced and have an idea of what each pre-constructed deck holds. Good mixture of tactics and luck. Works well with nongamers. Artwork is stunning, gameboard serves no purpose at all. Hoax beat Vulcan four out of five times. And never ever pit your Khind against the Aqua, because I fail to see how they could ever hope to win.

Not bad. Knizia's attempt at a collectible. I played on a Java version of the game. Interesting enough to keep me occupied and entertained but not enough for me to purchase.

This scratches something of the same itch that Magic did when I played it years ago, but without the financial black hole of expensive booster packs and rare cards. If dueling card games along the lines of Magic are at all interesting to you, this is well worth the price.

Update: The game still holds up well after many plays, even with just the basic decks. Bumped to a 8.

Update 2: I haven't played this in a long time and don't particularly miss it. While it's admittedly a different game, I find myself reaching for Dominion when I want a short, card-based game rather than Blue Moon. Dropped to a 6.

I've gotten one play in, and I think this is an excellent take on a Magic: The Gathering type game. Mind you, it really does not play anything like the lord of CCGs, but it certainly has a CCG feel to it. I'll probably pick up some extra decks, too.

Incredible two-player card game. Don't be fooled in to thinking it is a mere trick-taking game or some form of glamorized WAR. Beautifully rendered cards and elegant play. 

The base set is a great introduction to the game and showcases two races that are fairly simple to get going but afterwards have incredible potential to go toe-to-toe with any other race (particularly the Hoax).

RATING: 5
I'm a bit concerned that once a player gets an early lead in dragons, it appears very difficult to catch up.  I see very little flip-flop in the lead.  I'm also a bit concerned that the strategy for each deck seems pretty inflexible--and that each deck only has one winning strategy.  Also, I've noticed that some cards are only useful at the beginning or middle of the game, and some are obviously intended to be useful at the end of the game.  Since there's no reshuffling of the discard deck, if you get the wrong cards at the wrong time, you can get irretrievably behind very early in the game, and know you'll never be able to catch up, yet you still have to play out the hand, which can make the game less fun.

PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

UPDATE: Traded for an extra copy so we can have mirror matches. Yep, I love this game.

UPDATE: Now in the running for 'best game ever'. It's the game Magic the Gathering would be if the chrome was stripped out and it wasn't a CCG with more rules than pebbles on your average beach. Knizia is a genius for creating a game with the feel of Magic, but which has about four rules and almost endless replayability with one or two pre-built decks.

Got in London on Board maths trade with several expansions. It's a battle game with beautiful graphics, lovely big cards, simple rules and a fair amount of tactics. Plays very quick, and is very satisfying. 

You have to get a higher number on your cards than your opponent so the tactics are about which cards to play when.

The world of Blue Moon is in chaos. Its god has abandoned it, and its people are in open war against each other, while the ruling power of three elemental dragons reigns above all! In this original game designed by Reiner Knizia, each player takes control over one of the Blue Moon peoples - the creative machinations of the Mimix, the fiery Vulca, the lofty Flit, and the clever Hoax - in their quest for dominance. The Blue Moon Legends basic set provides all the material needed to play, including details on the various peoples, a game board, full-color rules, and three plastic dragon figures. Expansion packs contain additional people cards.

Looked online to see if we were misunderstanding the rules, etc. But we never found what I would qualify as a "game" (I'm being harsh, it's obviously  game. But not one that has any mechanics that create ...something that would feel like you're playing a game.) when playing Blue Moon.

It's interesting to have asymmetrical decks, but the game still felt fairly luck-driven overall.  There were a couple of rounds when I didn't even have cards I could play on my first turn (low strength character cards and an inability to play support and/or booster cards on a first turn).

RATING: 7
Not a bad card game. It reminds me a lot of Magic, but with a lot of things I don't like about that game fixed, including the transient nature of most cards making it so that no combo can be too terribly broken. The main problem I have is that the main interest in the game for me is deck-building, but without having other people to play with, this part falls flat. That may sound like it's more of an issue for me personally than with the game, but there are some dead CCGs I'd rather expend effort trying to get people into, and when it comes down to it, I didn't have as much fun playing this as I did Scarab Lords (another Knizia 2-player card game), and that game doesn't require any "prep work" to make the most out of it (and has a smaller but more interesting in-game deck-tweaking component itself).

Still, I wish I'd discovered this a couple of years ago when I was trying to sell my Magic playing friends on the joys of hobby gaming. I got by without it, but this probably would've made it easier :)

A solid game where you play one race (the base game comes with two races, but there are expansions). The game is a series of battles in either fire or earth. At the start of you turn, you can play a leadership card (general tricks), must play a character card, and then can either play a booster (one time help) or support (continuous help throughout the fight). The fights continue until someone runs out of cards.

The simplicity of the rules belies all the tricks one can encounter -- and then the simplicity catches you in a rules quandary that you have no hope of answering without help from Chris Dearlove. With the FAQ close at hand, though, you can focus on solving your hand and not worry about rules issues.

RATING: 7
Great game, with a lot of replayability. Very much a classical Knizia game in playing feel, and less a CCG than may be apparent at first (less a CCG than I wanted, actually, with too little true variation and some weird costing around the edges). Great tension between preserving and spending power, and the effects also preserve that same level of conflicting goals.

Very exciting 2 player game, with a lot of possibilities and every time we play it, we promis ourselves to play it more often with the expansions ... unfortunatly we own 51st State.

RATING: 6
If you only have two people to play a game, this is a fine game. The rules are a bit contrived and the rules booklet needs some re structuring. The non collectible expansions are cool, but I suggest they release a second starter set of some kind so people can get the rules with different factions.

A non-CCG CCG.  Pre-constructed decks that benefit when you know how to play them to their strengths.  Beautiful artwork on the cards.

RATING: 6.5
A very interesting card game which is very different in many ways than a typical CCG.  It plays more like Poker than magic, with bluffs being an important part of the game.  I'm curious to see how it holds up over time.

RATING: 9
Although similar to Scarab Lords, Blue Moon allows for more strategy due to larger playing hands and the dual elemental powers.  The additional decks of peoples expands the replayability to a much greater degree.

Also, importantly for me, my wife finds Scarab Lords to be a bit too spiteful in its confrontational ways, whereas Blue Moon has a bit softer edge.

RATING: 5
The cards are not functional. You have to look very carefully to read the relevant text. As you see important cards of the opponent upside down, you can basically a) only trust him that he informs you right (less of a problem) and b) ask again every time you don't remember exactly what that card did. That's a pain in the ***. But there's a good game inside that mess. My g/f doesn't like it at all.

We played Blue Moon a few times, but not enough for the rules to click, which meant we didn't enjoy it as much as I had expected. I was hoping for a Magic replacement - or something close - and I think it still could be. Will return to it and see if becomes clearer.

RATING: 7
As far as I'm concerned,this is an "average" game in that it's not really my kind of game but I certainly do quite enjoy it and understand it well enough to want to play often. My BF really likes it so I would like to improve my skills but that will likely take time. It's a good game, simple but also strategic. Not a wacky-fun one but quite pleasant. Some randomness, which I always like. I think in general I do like card games. I play this online a lot and much prefer handling cards and having the interaction with people. Plus, I find it easier to play IRL in terms of knowing how to play the special texts, etc. It can be quite challenging with an excellent player but in a good, stimulating way. Excellent artwork, theme, mythology, etc. Simply beautiful, wonderful, and amazing! Overall, a good experience and definitely a game I would play over and over again but not one I would especially seek. It is inspirational though, on a creative level.

This game fell flat for me as I just didn't feel that thematic connection. At it's heart this is just a simple numbers game, and for me it never grew beyond that. I really feel it's a waste of the evocative artwork.

Well, this one is hard. On one hand the artwork is fantastic, it covers all the oversized cards showing pretty well the talent of the artists. The dragon miniatures are really cool. But... the system is too simple, the board is useless... it's good when you go for a fast paced game but that's all.

Een spel dat doet denken aan Magic: the Gathering, maar dan een stuk vereenvoudigd.

De volken van Blue moon strijden om de troon en jij neemt de honeurs waar van één van deze volken en je tegenstander van een ander. Je zet om de beurt personen in om de kracht van de tegenstander te overtreffen. Lukt dit je niet, dan verlies je een gevecht en krijgt je tegenstander de gunst van één of meerdere draken. Deze draken bepalen wie de troon mag bestijgen. Degene die na alle gevechten de meeste draken heeft aangetrokken, mag zich heerser van Blue Moon noemen.

RATING: 7.1
Owning all the expansions, I can still say that this game feels slightly incomplete, though that's probably due to the scope of the project initially. The game's what I would call a solid game, it's good, but not outstanding.

Artwork is fantastic, unlike many other card games. Card quality is great but why oh why did they make it a size that is so hard to find sleeves for? I pretty much cringe playing it as I still haven't found sleeves for it.

Would therefore NOT recommend this game for children, but for teens or adults only, as the wear and tear will quickly come.

nov 14, 2004 first play with sean. we played 4 or 5 games during that evening and with each game, new levels of depth were found..a gem.
nov 28. now have the khind and terrah expansions. I prefer the decks that are a bit more difficult to play and a bit of flexibility rather than sheer strength (flit & khind being favourites so far)..lost a point as hasn't been played since!

Played once. I assume most of the interest of this game derives from knowing the cards and their interaction, and what to expect from your deck and your opponent's. After a single play, I can only appreciate that the rules are simple and the game is  rather pleasant, but I play much too few 2-player games to be able to really appreciate it. Still, the non-collectible aspect appeals to the former CCG-player I am.

RATING: 8
When you first learn this game it is OK, but it gets better and better and you learn the decks. Play the same matchup over and over. That is the way that this game really shines! The system gives you constant edge of your seat, back and forth action, where any slip up can push you to the edge of defeat - but then a last minute rally can bring you back into the game!

I really like how simple mechanics play one or two cards (rarely more then that) allows for nice combos and great tactical plays. My wife also likes it despite the fact that we have the German version and none of us speaks any German. 

On one hand the theme seems dry but after few plays you get a feeling of duels with fighters stepping one after the other onto the ring to fight for their race. 

Acquired Sep 2010 in mathtrade. 

EDIT: Despite quite enjoying the depth in its simplicity this game doesn't seem to excite me anymore.

Kind of like a CCG distilled down into non-CCG form. No substitute for Magic, but the fixed decks mean you can really learn every card and combination for a matchup (similar to high-level Constructed play for M:TG). Surprising depth and strategy given the fundamental simplicity.

Quick-playing, tactic-filled, and vicious card play. Lots of combos and variety jammed into a simple ruleset. A game that would definitely benefit from a lot of repeated play. Probably wouldn't get stale for a long time.

Sold. I don't see much 2-player time and this game really deserves to have the shit played out of it in my opinion. I would love to play it 3-4 times a week but just can't.

I absolutely hated this game at first.  I want to feel like something is happening in a game, and this just feels like passing a plastic dragon back and forth for 15 minutes, before someone runs out of cards and the game ends.  I'm hoping deck construction improves the game.

For a game with a (pretty) simple ruleset, there's a lot of variety in this little gem.  Games are short and very tactical.  The better player will win.  I'm glad I picked this up.  Unfortunately you need to play this multiple times to really start exploring the depth of the game; in today's environment of instant gratification a good number of people will play Blue Moon once or twice, wonder what all the fuss is about and never play it again.  Which is a shame.  If you buy Blue Moon, play it at least half a dozen times before writing it off!  I'll bet things start "clicking" with you and you'll see what I mean.

RATING: 9
I play this one with my buds often -- I only have the starter set (Vulca and Hoax), but it never ceases to amuse; we always play best out of 3; if the Hoax beat the Vulca we call that "breaking serve."  Very portable and convenient -- leave the dragons at home -- most gamers can keep track of who is ahead by at most 2 points ("dragons").  Even when we have 3 or more people, sometimes we'll still play this game -- with much kibitzing and taunting from the peanut gallery.

Very easy for a new player to pick up.  It's like a strange hybrid of a CCG and [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing].  I like it.  Each turn provides tough decisions, unless you're getting shown up, in which case the decision to retreat is easy.  Many of the times that you retreat, you gain card advantage on your opponent, helping to stage your comeback.

I'm 12 plays into Blue Moon, and it's still too early to rate.  I've played almost all of the decks at least once.

I'll rate it once things settle down a bit and I can get past all the flash (right down into the smash).

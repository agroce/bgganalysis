Por fin un VERDADERO juego de piratas! Muy parecido al Pirates de Sid Meier de PC.
Aquí serás totalmente libre de hacer todo lo que puedes esperar de un juego de piratas (explorar, comerciar, atacar, saquear, ir a la guerra o vivir aventuras en mares traicioneros...).
Un juego pequeño quizá con demasiado azar y con componentes no demasiado buenos, pero muy temático.
Si te gustan los juegos de piratas te encantará este.
--------------------------------------------------
Finally a REAL pirates game! This game really feels similar to Sid Meier Pirates PC game.
You can do everything you would expect on a pirates game (trading, attacking, plundering, going to war or living adventures on the rough seas...)
Small-sized game with a bit too much random and not very nice components, but with a lot of theme. If you like pirates you will LOVE this.

i had a lot of fun with this game, and played it many times.  especially with two players.  a deluxe production with a much better box, non-paper ships, non-folded playmats, etc would be nice.  the cardstock, funny as it seems at first glance, holds up extremely well and i've got no complaints.  many have maligned the rules on this game, and i don't blame them.  it took a lot of work to sort them out.  ultimately i like the system, and i do share others' problems with the 2 major hoser cards.  my biggest problem is actually the treasure fleets, i think it's far too easy to arrange a fight with them and win.  the island combo cards and such are neat ideas, but not common or deep enough to actually involve a strategy.  i'd play it again, and probably enjoy it, but it was time for this game to find another home.

RATING: 2
I think this is just not my kind of pirate game; pretty dry, and lacking in anything that might make me want to go "Arr!" Still, I know some like it much better than I do, so I'm hoping to find it a good home.

Traded away for Terra. Goodbye, Plunder. I wanted to like you, but couldn't in the end.

Great card game! Very exciting and close to reality, you can feel the piracy in that game just with the cards and some rules very close to what can happens on sea! Some special cards are very strong!

Rules must be read twice and more before play because they need many clarifications but after the learning curve is acheive this game plays very well!

Pirates, UGGGGHHHHHH!! I was extremely disappointed in Plunder. The rules are written in annoying Piratespeak and are utterly incomprehensible. The Concise Rules from the Files section helped immensely. They helped me realize how lackluster this game is.

RATING: 7
After one playing, I went out and bought two Pirates of the Carribean boosters for little pirate ships.  Unfortunately, the boosters usually come with one small ship and one big ship, and the big ships I got were frankly huge.... as for the game, it's very fun and seems to capture being a pirate (historically speaking) much more than Pirate's Cove.  I think Pirate's Cove is as much fun, however, due to its lightness which compensates for the increased amount of luck.

My gameplay of this game is very limited.  but through reading & discussing the rules on the geek, this game seems like a great pirate game! Iplayed this a couple of times with my wife and they were'nt very good games since my wife doesn't like the game: i think because there's too much strategy).  But I rated this game high because I see the potential of some great games with a group of people who know how to play the game.
--A warning:  The game looks small & simple, but it can be complex, until you learn all the rules properly (which can be difficult).  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Plays very like a board game for what is ostensibly a card game. Light, quite luck driven but a lot of fun, expecially the forced interaction of having to end your go by playing a card on the next player - nice idea. Very good for kids (theme and all) but I expect adults will tire of this eventually. One major advantage is the box size. I doubt you will get an equivalent board game in anything near such a small box. Minor gripe, the rules aren't all that well written. They do become clear on playing through but still leave a few questions unanswered (and would it have hurt to put '2-4 players, 30-60 mins' on the box?)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game was surprisingly heavy for such a small box.  A lot of strategic game in a small package.  Players build a map during the course of gameplay and accumulate resources in an effort to amass a fortune of 60 silver.  You throw obstacles in the path of your opponents, engage in simple combat, explore dangerous land, and buy and sell cargo.  Lots of ways to acquire and lose loot keep the game interesting.  As long as the map gets built with enough straightaways, you can sail to draw to a max hand size of 7, as sailing is the only way to draw cards.  I loved it, though we ran out of time and couldn't finish, we'll be playing again soon.

RATING: 5
Rules so bad and inconsistent that they had to be rewritten by players. Still confusing even after the rewrite! Some clever ideas that weren't translated into good gameplay mechanics. It does capture the spirit of piracy, however. I'd recommend this more for game designers than for game players. Merchants and Marauders is a much better game.

RATING: 6
Pick-up-and-deliver, hand management, poor rules, tile placement, exploration.  Voodoo curse card seems a bit too powerful.

Rich theme married with solid mechanics. Plenty of piratey good times here though the rule booklet could do with an overhaul (or should that be keelhaul?). Take out some of the more painful event cards and spruce up the components (I hear a reprint is on the cards) and it's a surefire winner.
***UPDATE*** Dropped to a 7. The unclear rules mean I can never be bothered to get this out so it'll sit on the shelf until someone is in a piratey mood and asks for it.

RATING: 6
I bought it cause it's a pirate game.  Yarr!!  But somehow the theme didn't quite rescue the game.  Our first play (4p) indicated that while there's lots of ways to earn money, sailing to the open sea and plundering ships is so much faster than any other method that everyone does it.  Then when someone gets close to winning, you switch to attacking them.  
Overall: probably not going to be a favorite, but there may be more to this game than I've seen so far.  I'll give it a try or two more before abandoning it to Davy Jones' locker.

Update: Nope, didn't try it again before trading it away.  Our first game was boring, and my group just wasn't willing to give it another go.

RATING: 7.5
I like the way this game handles the fortunes of being a pirate.  Things can go your way for a long time, cards line up and treasure maps lead you to untold riches.  But just around the corner, when you're not looking, the Kraken is waiting to smash your ship and the Governor is waiting to steal all your hard-earned booty.  Tides swing wildly and there's always hope - even when you're sunk.  

I won't echo in too much detail the woes of the rulebook, or the papery components.  Those topics have been debated enough.  But once you finally do learn to play the game, the narrative of the play makes this game one of my favorites.  Better than any pirate game I've owned before.

RATING: 3
The rules for this are so poorly written that it comes off as downright confusing at first. Once you sort out the mess though this is a standard little "take that!" game. The feel of exploration is captured fairly well. The little chest is adorable, but what's the point if it barely fits all the components? I would rate this one higher if it weren't for the poorly written-rules. As it is, it doesn't see enough playtime so having to re-learn the rules every time is just painful.

The game is fun, but the rules are poorly written, which led to my friend and i constantly checking and double-checking things.  Also, I think it's a bit random at 2-player.  My friend and I basically found ourselves on the "luck" end of things more than anything else.  Combat was easy to evade, we never had to fight each other or the ports for any reason.  In fact, we only fought when it allowed ut so take over a treasure fleet, or capture a prize ship, I believe.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A much better game than the prettier Pirate's Cove.  A great multi-use card system encompasses hand management, exploration, take-that, and resolutions.  Art is a little bit dodgy, the cards are a little text-heavy, and the rules seem incomplete but other than that, it's the best pirate game on the market.

Oh, this game. There's so much going on, so many things you can do, so much theme, all crammed into a tiny box. It's very far from perfect — some cards and events are brutally mean, and you can absolutely lose a half-hour of progress from one mistake or attack. It's an old-school Ameritrash game at heart, with some slight Euro sensibilities. I won't play it often, but I don't think I'll get rid of it either...

Chaotic, but fun, and there are some interesting decisions to make.  There are "take that" kinds of cards, but you can often defend against them, and if not and your ship goes down, you don't lose your money (just what you are carrying), it's not THAT devastating.

Better than other pirate-themed experience games; manages to be both elegant and fiddly at the same time.  Takes much longer than the listed 45 minutes!  The "take that" encounters can be hugely disastrous, but it can still be fun in a Wiz-War kind of way.  But I'd rather play Wiz-War!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A good card simulation of pirate life, fun, fast, with heavy luck: you can lose everything in a glimpse, but you can still win playing aggressively.
There is no strategy, just sail and plunder ships and ports, faster than other pirates. Players can hamper others with nasty cards (Sirens, Kraken, Trial, Scurvy) and Mutiny when someone forget - or have not enough money - to pay crew.
We have great fun every time we play it!

RATING: 6
Played a couple of games now, and while fun, seemed to take an abnormally long time to get the game moving / completed.  One comment from the group, if the person leading is to the right of you you don't really have many options to try to do anything about it. you can fight, but if you have the encounter card that would prevent him / her from taking off in the lead, you can't play it on them, only to the person on your left.

Love the game.  It felt a little like Jambo in the sense of having to reach 60 silver via pirating (= combat   trade) or normal trading.  I hate Jambo, but loved this.

I really wanted to like this game. I picked it up from Gencon and it came in this great little treasure chest box.  It had such potential but the rules were far too difficult to understand and my buddy and I gave up after a while. I need to do some research and give it another go, I think it has a great deal of potential and hate to give up on it too soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For a pirate game, I like the exploratory aspects, and the opportunities to combat other ships, the treasure fleet and to search for treasure. However, the rules are very spotty, and critical rules are missing. You need to get the revised rulebook on BGG. And for a pirate game, while some pirating is necessary in the game, legitimate trading can offer an even faster way to victory than pure pirating, so it can be a bit anti-climactic.

There's a bunch of cool ideas here.  The movement drawing works well; the choice of what to do in a turn is not automatic and there is some planning involved.  What wrecks for me are 2 cards: Governor's Tax (a huge effect in what is essentially a race game since there are no catchup opportunities, apart from this card) and Stand Trial.  Whatever possessed the designers to include such game-breaking cards should be reviewed.  Also, not all cards are created equal which skews the luck of the draw factor.  Ex: First Mate cards; they are good as played cards and as a number.  If you draw it you win either way; if you didn't, well tough.  The game could shine, but it fails to for me.

Best light-medium pirate game out there.  Deep, yet simple, and allows for the tables to turn often.  I don't know if I like the Stand Trial card though, where a player has a chance to lose everything.  The thing is, it isn't hard to get everything back.  I also don't like how you can only hurt the person to your left.  

I reduced this from a 6 to a 3 seven years after purchasing this game. We've come too far mechanically for this game. Cards that reset your progress, hurting people on your left only, fiddly mechanics of whom you're at war with and you cargo. Anyone interested should probably purchase Merchants and Marauders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Some neat stuff.  Could probably use some fine tuning.  I hate where I can only play events on the person to my left.  Some of those cards are really nasty.  It's tough to get Letters of Marque when the other players don't want you to.

Great concepts, but improved by using the 'play encountercard on anyone' variant.  Almost too much chrome (letters of marque, nations at war, etc.) but much of it can/be introduced in pieces.

RATING: 3
Some intriguing game mechanics here, but the game is deeply flawed. The immediate problem is that there are too many overpowered screw cards and mega-windfalls. It also doesn't help that you can only play screw cards on the person downstream of you. Those problems are superficial, and could perhaps be fixed with house rules. The more serious problem is that once you boil it down to strategy -- find ships, take their stuff, bring it home and sell it -- it isn't very interesting. It feels as if the designer knows it's a boring game and tried to liven it up with a bunch of nasty screw cards, but that doesn't make it more fun. Just more annoying. Lots of promise, but ultimately a lousy game.

Feels like Blackbeard/Sid Meier's Pirates! light, focusing on naval actions.  However, the presence of certain "Ah-ah! Take that!" cards that can demolish a player's assets simply by drawing them really annoyed  our playing group to the point of not bothering with the game anymore.

The game wasn't as complicated as everyone makes it sound. I read through the rules once and it all seemed pretty clear to me. The game has an excellent theme and supports it very well. However, I'm not sure how much I enjoyed the game. It does seem to be very heavy on luck and take a while to play. If it played faster, I wouldn't mind the luck so much. Our first game took about 2 hours.

RATING: 7
Fun pirate game with unique movement mechanics, diceless combat, and a little historical FLAVOR.  Sweet game.  Unfortunately many here will never play it due to its cheap components.  If Days of Wonder would have published this and given it their always quality components, I could see it be a mammoth success. 

As it is, this game mixes fun, strategy, a little "take that", and a unique card drawing/movement engine into one big game in a small package. 

UPDATE:  Moved down to a "7" as the game becomes a bit repetitive after a few plays.  (I think this would be fixed by using the deeper "Commodore" rules but my wife doesn't want to add more complexity so I haven't tried it that way yet

RATING: 4
Pretty dissapointed in this, gave it +1 point for a lot of theme, but the game mechanics are convoluted for what the game is.  As one of the players in the game said "If you're going to this much trouble, just play Blackbeard, its a better game."

I recently played this again (7/15/10) after not pulling it out for a while. With a couple of tweaks from the designer's update (I used the new rules but not the cards - since I was playing with 2 players, the most significant change is that map cards played as encounters are able to be placed by the person receiving them), this is really pretty fun and not nearly as fiddly as I remembered.

It is, however, still one that I would recommend being familiar with before teaching it to others.

It’s been years since I last played Plunder so I don’t remember all the game nuances. I remember I never liked it very much and I heavily dislike pirate themes, however, the worst part is that Plunder has way too much uncontrollable luck.

I don’t think I will ever play it again, the only friend who had it no longer lives in my country and I won’t buy it. If I do play it again, I will come back to write a proper comment.

I did a solo walkthrough of a two player game. It seemed to have some interesting concepts, but I did not think it held together very well. Maybe I was not understanding something. The map didn't seem to expand very well. The encounters on your neighbor did not seem like a hazard to them. It is mostly just random based on the cards you draw. Also the idea of the countries at war seemed interesting, but did not seem to make a difference in practice. I am puzzled why it is rated as high on BGG as it is.

Excellent game from the makers of Horrific.  The mechanic involving creation of the gameboard using Open Sea cards drawn by the players is wonderful, creating a completely different map every time you play.  I have no experience with the Commodore rules, except for the rule regarding playing Encounter cards (which I find more interesting and "fair" than the original rule).  

Overall, it's a very fun game that stays on the lighter side of depth and strategy (which is not necessarily a bad thing).  Extra kudos for the ability to win the game in several different, but yet still viable, ways.

RATING: 5
I have owned this game for around 8 years and only recently got around to playing it. Despite all the great reviews, its quite a disappointing game.

A clunky movement system which doubles as a mechanic for drawing cards and an inconsistent text layout makes the game quite tedious to play. You never really feel like you are exploring locations because players choose when to put down landmarks (or coasts) or ports.

Also, players control the outcome of battles too easily and there isn't much tension when fighting. I'm really disappointed with this game (probably because my expectations were too high).

Great spin on the Pirate genre as it focuses more on the historical aspects of Privateering and Merchants. Combat is really basic but I didn't feel that was a bad thing. Playable multiple times in an evening. Has a strange resemblance of Sid Meyer's Pirate computer game so makes me wonder who got ideas from whom (obviously the old video game came first, but I wonder if it was part of these game designer's inspiration).

Great little game.  Price is a bit steep, the pirate ships need to be something besides a folded piece of paper.  The cards are perfect quality, the graphics are top notch, the overall quality is excellent for a game of this size.  The game play is original and fun!  Its the first boat game where the 'sailing' makes sense and is easy to navigate.  Well done game full of adventure.  Better than Pirate's Cove, Pirates of the Spanish Main, or any of the other crappy pirate bandwagon games.  This is THE ONE to get over the others.

What a fun pirate-themed game!  The rules seem a little fiddly, but once we learned the game it was a blast!  Great implementation of theme.

Update:  having played this many times I've decided that Plunder is my favorite pirate-themed game.  I am still a fan of Blackbeard (I prefer the original, even though the new version is quite good) but feel that (unlike Blackbeard v.1 and v.2) Plunder captures the theme in a fun and very accessible way.  Also, there's more strategy to this game than first meets the eye.  Overall... a great game.

With the rules it comes with I'd only give it 5 (it rewards treasure hunting more than piracy), but with a few minor tweaks (mainly the safe haven rules) its a fun piratey-game. Good with beers and non-sensitive friends.(On the last point I should give a warning, people who can't handle 'everybody screws everybody' type games should leave this alone. I've seen this game send adults into hissy-fits, walking out the game halfway through, refusing to ever play it again etc...)

RATING: 6
The rules are very hard to understand.  Once we got past that, I realized that despite the fact that I want to like this game, I just can't manage it.  It always seems to drag out too long, and the randomness of the cards really brings me down.  I usually alternate between not being able to get enough cards to defend myself to not being able to move enough because I have too many cards that are not useful to me.  Some of the cards/events like Storm seem overly devastating.  I like the theme and some of the mechanics, but the execution just kills the fun for me.

The way that combat works is nice, because it's not totally random, but the very limited ability to do much to anyone except the person following you in turn order (with the encounters) is frustrating.  If one player keeps getting the hostile encounter type cards, the player following them can have a pretty horrible experience with very few options.

After playing with the designer's encounter variant, I like this game a bit more.  I also look forward to playing the Commodore's game.

The best little pirate game I owned until Merchants and Marauders came along.  It's really nothing like it but it's very cute and gamey.  You create the sea over which you sail from the cards you play.  It actually comes with little paper ships....you move over the cards.  You can attack your opponents, bury your treasure, siege a town or shop in one...and you have to sail according to the prevailing winds. Very piratey.

A flawed gem just begging for the right set of house rules.
Some of the encounters seem disproportionately nasty, and the production is lacking in a couple of places; nonetheless, this feels like a big game in a little box.  The strange card management mechanism is like nothing else I've seen, and works surprisingly well.

There are some small modifications that - in our opinion - should be made to make this a great game:
1. There are a few encounter cards where the opponent doesn't have a defense.   Can't remember their names, but take them out and burn them.
2. The storm - deal with the effects of the storm, then shuffle the deck and draw a replacement card - continue your turn as normal. 

These two tweaks remove most of the unfairness; bad things can still happen; but with careful planning, you should be able to avoid them.  Jury is still out on the voodoo curse - we left it in because attacking another ship probably always should be a dangerous proposition.

Suffers from some card hoseage. First time we played the ship turning restriction wrong; we held the direction from turn-to-turn. Need a few more plays.

RATING: 5.5
The basic mechanism that allows the multiple uses of the cards is not bad actually; somewhere in the cards lies a decent game. However, the balance of cards put me off slightly. Some of the cards are just way too powerful, swinging the balance of the game totally. I guess it is a dilemma inherent in this type of games. Not enough special cards result in bland experiences, while having too many destroys the balance. Also, for most of the ships, boarding felt a bit too easy, which is another unbalance in the cards. Overall result is a game that feels a bit too long and repetitive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
So many choices per turn, so many ways you can go in order to get the 60 silver pieces needed, and many cards to play to hinder your opponents.  Also, the pirate theme is all over it, from rum to mermaids.  The only problem are the rules.  A lot of doctoring and "smoothing over" has to be done to get the best out of the game.  However, once you settle on the house rules and get the mechanics down pat, it's gaming bliss.

UPDATE:  Ultimately, I have come to prefer elegance and simplicity more than attempting to put everything related to theme into a game.  I have grown tired of explaining the rules for more than 10 minutes and leaving everybody still clueless about the game until they start playing it.  It is more of a lite RPG than a quick card game, and it loses significance in my library of games that I want to take out and play with the least amount of time spent in teaching it.

UPDATE 2:
I believe Merchants and Marauders put this into obsolete from what little I've read about M&M.

2Player: For all of the buildup, I found the game a little flat.  There was a lot of sailing back and forth for no other purpose than to draw cards.  The ease of obtaining cards and the abundance of cards with high numbers meant that most tasks were trivial with almost guaranteed success.
Of particular [dis]interest was the fact that players had less to gain from sacking a port than from attacking a ship.  The ports contained no more goods than a ship, and in the end provided no extra ship - which brings up the whole notion of the prizes. Every ship may be taken as an undamaged prize.  Wow.  Pretty lucky that.
I'll give the game further plays, but with an eye toward house rules that will spice it up and make it far more interesting than the out-of-the-box version.

Arr! This be a treasure chest full of fun. The very antithesis of boxes that are too big for the game, Plunder packs a huge amount of game into a very little container. All the pirate-game staples are here: plunder, battles, looting, trading and even the parrot! In truth, it's perhaps a fraction too complex for what it needs to be, there can be a shocking amount of down-time and luck, and the card-laying playing area would surely be better using tiles (without significantly changing the gameplay). But, as a one-off, it's pleasurable enough.

Learning to play Plunder is quite a challenge.  The rules are not as clear as they might be, and many questions come up that the rules do not seem to address. Nevertheless, it's a fun game and just the thing for Talk Like a Pirate Day (September 19--look it up if you don't believe me).  I bought it for its pirate theme and it really delivers on that.  This is a very compact game with attractive, if simple, components.  Only the ships are a disappointment, but I hope one day to replace them with some from Pirates of the Spanish Main. (4+4)

Points for the card based maps and counters. The game is an interesting concept but I guess I was expecting a little too much when playing. The game tends to be on the short side (1hr) and can be quite cutthroat if the person on your right plays a lot of cards that restricts you. Furthermore there don't seem to be a point in buying or taking over smaller ships. Still this is a good pirate game. Game play does get better with repeated plays but as it is a light game, do not expect too much out of it.

I feel it matched the pirate's theme quite well.  It was slow learning it, however after awhile, got going pretty well.  Some rules seemed odd, where I think the encounter portion is semi broken.  I feel the game is improved with taking select rules from its expansion, The Commodore's Game.

The rules are indeed poorly written. Really obscure. The "precise and concise rules" founded here on BGG are a good solution. Still the game is good but not great. The "pirate" theme doesn't appeal me too much, so imo it's just a light exploration game with some fight for resources. A bit repetitive and a bit too long (about 1 hour to play with 3 or 4 people).

I've only played the game with 2 players and I don't have much of an urge to play it that way again anytime soon. However, I think it'll be much more fun with 4 players and I anticipate my rating will go up once I play it with more players.

The compact design of this game is a plus, it takes up almost no space at all. There are multiple strategies to win. Will you focus on trading, plundering, attacking other players? From what nations will you carry a Letter of Marque from? Will you use a fast, weak ship that can't hold much plunder, or go for a formidable hull that slowly lumbers along? Considering its size and components, it is dripping with pirate theme. I'm very glad I have this game and sincerely hope to play it with 3 or 4 players soon.

Fun game, just right length-of-play, reasonable implementation of pirate theme.  I've enhanced the playing materials with replica period coins, "Pirates of the x" ships, and store it in a small wooden treasure chest.  To be played while listening to sea shanties (or Flogging Molly).

RATING: 7
Rule ambiguities, randomness, and screw cards work against this game, but it has a great theme and some interesting mechanics. Probably the best pirate game around (not saying much) and certainly better than Pirate's Cove. I also appreciate the small details, such as the letters of the marque.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game has issues:  poorly written rules; clunky game play; a fair amount of downtime between turns; a few overly powerful cards that can make or break a game.  It feels like a game that is "not quite there".

HOWEVER the game truly does get the theme right:  a quick and interesting battle (and plundering) system, a well done exploration/map-generation system, interesting intrigue between the nations, trade, treasure hunting, mermaids, everything! By far the most fun pirate game that I've ever played (FAR superior to Pirates of the Spanish Main and Pirate's Cove and much lighter than Blackbeard (which is good!)).  My rating for Plunder will definitely go up if the clunkiness dissipates after more play.

BIG kudos for the designers and developers for coming to BGG to answer questions.  I probably wouldn't have given the game a chance without the rules clarifications.

RATING: 5
So far, I really like Plunder (we'll see where things go with further plays). It scratches the piratical itch, and in addition to being sufficiently "gamey" to be interesting, it's fun. There are some negatives that made it really hard to get started, however. The rules. They may look alright on paper, but I guarantee all sorts of unanswered questions will begin popping up when you try to play. We had to figure out certain things inductively, as the rules just aren't very precise. The quality of the components could also be a lot better. I would have gladly paid a little more for a larger box with higher quality components. I don't normally gripe about component quality, but if I like a game, I like the game to have nice bits - and this one doesn't. So it just seems a shame. I'm looking forward to playing many more games (after scouring for rules clarifications online), and will adjust my comments accordingly. I hope to see some expansions for this game in the future, or better yet, an expanded reprint with much nicer components and a larger box. (I appreciate conserving cardboard, but the box is really too small.)

Working mainly off the player aid by sodaklady, I have restructured and fine-tuned the rules in a 2 page document, and uploaded it to BGG. I hope it will help people have a better initial experience with this fun game. It's located here: http://www.bggfiles.com/viewfile.php3?fileid=12919

As a tribute to sodaklady (Mary Weisbeck), whose notes I used as a starting point, her name remains in the "author" field when you look at the "Properties" of the file.

With respect to Plunder as a two player game, I don't really care for it. It's just no fun when you play "Stand Trial" on the other player and she happens to lose all her treasure. If you have the opportunity to make such a powerful play in a game, any game, then doing so should enrich the experience. With four players, the feel of the game is substantially different, and such shenanigans are more rewarding - not just in terms of winning and losing, but in terms of the psychological experience. Plunder also thrives on inter-player conflict and competition, and a more crowded playing field enhances that aspect of the game. If I want a two player game where conflict is the focus, there are better choices out there.

RATING: 3
Well, I really wanted to like this.  There is a nice mechanic in the tie between movement  and drawing cards.  I like the need to balance your actions versus leaving a defense for yourself.  But, while the exploration, pick up and delivery, pillaging and random ship combat are good, they are undermined by the fact that the game just devolves into a take that card game where the cards are absurdly powerful.  Plus, perhaps the worse rule I've seen in any game.  If you forget to pay your crew before you move and someone notices it there is a mutiny and you lose your ship, what you may have in tow and all your cargo, along with all your cards and you are sent back to the begining.  This pretty much kills any fun that there is to had. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Don't be fooled by the non-standard packaging and cheaply made components.  This is the best pirate themed board game I have yet played.  It is as close to Sid Meier's "Pirates!" as you can possibly get without a computer.  It is much better than the Pirates Constructible Card Game, though the ships from that series are perfect for Plunder ship markers.  It's a great game with a lot of potential actions, and it is easily modifiable with house rules for a varied experience.  My main complaint is that the game seems to go too quickly.  You don't often get to experience all that is possible in the game before a winner emerges.

I just wish they would have used a different starting ship type... like Sloop... instead of Pinnace, which can generate funny looks when pronounced out loud.

Plunder features everything piratey: Capturing and plundering cargo from merchant ships, treasure maps, natives, all the famous Caribbean ports, trading, scurvy, bar fights, pirate fleets, the Kraken, first mates, wars between nations, letters of marque, and mutinies. Each game plays like an unfolding story and each mechanic (like splitting plundered bounty with the crew), evokes piratey theme.

Interesting game. I didn't immediately grasp all the ways the rules interact but with more playing it becomes clear how well thought-out they are.  The War/Letters of Marque/Trading is a wonderful combination for strategy, the Combat is simple yet very thematic and the Act/Encounter actions keep the theme alive.  So far I've only played 2 players; I think with more players, the down time may be a bit much.

I like pirates. I like the multiple-use cards and the abstract map making. i don't like the way the rules are written in first person, heavy pirate dialect - "iff'n ye wants yer gold ye'll ..." Read the rules clarifications on bgg, substitute ship pieces for the paper tents and it's pretty good.

Simply horrible.  It's a whack-a-mole type of game where, if you have good cards you can do something.  If you don't have the cards, you sit and do nothing.  Ship combat is entirely unbalanced, and event cards can abruptly slap you down to nothing without warning.  Oh you can have a great ship and then someone plays a card that says simply "You lose," and then you're hosed.  Then you're stuck in a hole you can't get out of.  Use the stylish box to stash your weed.  It's more useful that way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Heavier than expected, Plunder falls into that awkward spot where the rules are too complicated to whip it out as a filler and the mechanics are too random to justify serious play. It's highly thematic, though, and if I had the slightest interest in pirates I would be thrilled.

The components are rather less thrilling: the cards and chits are fine, and the money is nicer than cardboard coins usually are, but folded paper player aids simply cannot be borne.

I feel like this is the kind of game I would've loved to have in highschool -- a big game in a small box. Now I'd rather have big games in appropriately-sized boxes, with no compromises on component quality.

Pirate adventure full of theme and decisions. Awesome game but needed to mix and match rules from Commodore Expansion to make it really shine. I wish it was a little bit more balanced with less luck. Having 3-4 players usually evens it out with ganging up on the Leader.

Rules used:
Movement from Commodore's Expansion.
New Encounter rules from Karl Lepp.
Storm card affects all ships not in port/costland.
Stand Trial nerfed to half a captain's treasure.

It's okay, getting a bad hand of cards can really cause problems (as it did for me although I eventually won through persistence at playing the high-scoring cards that I'd had for some time).  A bit light on the theme as well although I like the way ships' movement is limited by "the wind".

This is a wonderful pirate game. The rules seem clunky and confusing at first, but once you get it, the game flows like waves beneath your hull. My wife and I play this as often as our 2P-only games. It is a very fun card-based trading-plundering-nautical game. This is an example of a game that is more fun to play than to win. It is very much a simulation game, which was part of the designer's intent.

If you like this, you might want to try Lost Valley. It is similarly rich in theme and detail.

This game is just luck of cards.  You can try as you might for a strategy, but there are too many cards in the deck that basically say "I win this game" or "I stop you from winning".  Therefore someone that is in last place the whole game and doing very silly moves can win the whole game if they draw the right cards. 
Mechanics are good and play is a litlle fun, but you feel cheated after playing that someone just drew the right card to win the game and there's no strategy or play (unless you draw the other perfect card) you can do.

Early rating. I'm a sucker for pirate games, so I had to have this based on the orgasmic praise it has received.
Sadly, the gameplay is not that deep. It is heavy on theme, but the game mechanics need a lot of improvement. Decision-making is not challenging. The rules need to be tweeked. I haven't read the Commodore's revision. Hope it does improve. (I'm not sure why they say it has "multiple paths to victory". Everyone says that nowadays. Don't think it applies to this game, frankly.)
Just playing a random card making a ship appear and instantly attacking it is not fun gameplay. Stuff shouldn't just happen, there should be some build up and options to consider.

I'm already working on some custom rules...buried treasure, rioting, pilfering...aargh, I'll make a fun game outta this yet, bilge rat!

Acquired Mar 30 2005.  I like it better than Pirate's Cove.  Errol Flynnesque pirate game with plenty of "Take That" moments.  Raid ships, dig-up buried treasure, capture treasure fleets, or trade for the win with natives, this game has multiple paths to victory and does an excellent job of capturing the pirate theme and running with it.  It also has a world-building element that is enjoyable.

Plunder is a fast playing game that can be played with a minimum of two players (a plus).  The art work is well done and the cards are of a high quality.  It took me a few games to get the rules down pat--without having to look things up--but you can start playing in a few minutes.  It's definately a game that you get better at the more you play--discovering strategies, etc...  The other good thing about this game is its compact box.  I can always find room for it in my suitcase.

Finally - the pirate game that gets it right! Plunder is the card game which combines the many elements of "euro-style" games, boyhood adventure, and actual history into a fast-paced escapade about the pirate's life! A big game in a little box: cards are laid out to form a different map-board each game. Combines the best features of card and board games. New mechanics for strategic randomization, with no dice. Each card has a number which may be played to add to different ratings. Multiple paths to victory: plunder ships, explore strange coast lands, and trade goods between ports. Combines history (actual nationalities, ports, and ships) with fantastical elements (from the dreaded kraken to the lure of mermaids).C ategory: Card Game, Pirates, Adventure, Exploration;  Mechanics: Hand Management, Pick-up and Deliver, Tile Placement; Expanded by: Plunder: The Commodore's Game

45 minutes?  Try THREE HOURS for our first game.  I expect that once you have the rules ambiguities ironed out (and whoa, nelly, are there a lot of them), you might be able to get it in under 45 minutes.  For the record, we played about 6 rules incorrectly, but I do like the design and see a lot of potential there ... so long as it remains a short, light game.

a rather strange piratical game about getting rich (so far as I can see as have yet to know the actual point of the game as no mention of winning is in the rules sheet I got!) in the caribbean, game play can be a touch vindictive though as the rules state you can only play bad (or potentially good I suppose) things on the person to your left, rules are somewhat confusing as stated in my opinion but never the less good fun, game enhanced by the use of PotC ships too. OO it comes in a really cool chest shaped box and includes 2 lovely velveteen draw string bags, everything for the game fits nicely in the chest and even PotC ships on cards would fit in there too

I still feel that I haven't given this a real run-through.  I need to pull together a group of buccaneers and splinter a few ships on the high seas one last time.

In unrelated news, the designers of Plunder had intended to release an [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/153043/new-rules-and-other-updates]improved second edition[/url], but that never came to fruition.  Too bad.

Update:

Even after integrating a majority of the second edition rules, Plunder still falls flat.  The dreaded "lose yer gold!" cards remain overpowered (though we tone them down), and the combat domino effect is tough to sidestep: Player B spends cards to kill Player A, so Player B is now open to destruction by Player C, etc.

A more serious fault with the game is that players know in advance whether they are guaranteed a combat victory against ships played from their own hands.  Some form of uncertainty in player vs. NPC combat is sorely needed.

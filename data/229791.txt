Eh, it's OK. The versus mode seems to be the best developed and is pretty good for a quick game with some interaction and some light thinking. Solo was very underwhelming. As a solo experience, it's not in the same ball park as other low-play time games like Friday, Coffee Roaster or even Hoplomachus: Origins. Major typo on the player reference, and there's lots of room to improve the rule book (as it seems is always the case for CTG products.

Edit, Feb. 2018: upping this a but, since the two player game is pretty good. My wife enjoyed our plays of it. I'll never play it solo again, though. My rating is a combination of the solo and two player games.

I enjoy playing a quick game from time to time. My only grudge is that rolling dice to take actions does not fit the nature of the game. Such is abstract in nature. I really wished that you could have an alternative of choosing one or two actions and having to make  a meaningful decision in the process. I usually end up discarding the roll and choosing the action that I want. So, much so that I do not see the point of rolling the dice in the first place.... I would have rated the game higher if I hadn't had that issue with the dice.
Update. On my 10th play I did not even bother to roll the dice :)

Received through KS.

Had a great time with two player.  Love the quick play, was actually expecting a little bit more in terms of memory requirement.  A few notes:
- Knowing what is hidden only provides very limited advantage in many cases because you still have to position properly for the diagrams.  
- Disrupting your opponent seems to be a stronger strategy, although there is reasonable balance in order for the game to move forward.
- Many diagram uses in two player seem highly limited because it is too easy for your opponent to interfere.
- Many of the character abilities are limited.
Really love the feel, art, and components.  Looking forward to trying out some more single player.

The components are really great in this game as expected by this publisher. The game play is quick and more simple than I expected once I played it. The pacing of the game is spot on, I think if it was any longer it wouldn't be as fun. Where the mechanics aren't earth shattering I found them to be different enough from other games to be interesting. This is a good 2 player filler.

RATING: 7
It's not a complicated game, but boy, is it confusing to learn and confusing to teach.  Adding insult to injury is a player reference card with a confusing typo on it.    The dice further confuse things, because players intuitively think they have to do the actions shown on the dice, but that isn't the case.   

This an intriguing game that I enjoy sporadically, but also feels like it might be more trouble than it's worth.  I do appreciate the attention that went into the components and I really like the overall style.

This game works well with 2 and even better with 1.  As a solo game, it features an interesting story with some fantastic character art.  My only complaint about the art is that it's entirely unnecessary, as you really don't ever need to look at your oh so beautiful character sheet at all.  It features a cool memory mechanic, and the story is intriguing.  I would often play without the traps or counter-measures cards as they make for some very difficult situations and are perhaps too overpowered.  Play with just the regular diagrams and you'll have a great time.

First thing: the components are Amazing, second to none. Everything from the box to the cards and chips to the deluxe play mat and the tube it came in is top shelf quality. The game has been cleverly designed and the solo mode storyline is engrossing. While the actual gameplay is not exactly connected to the theme, it is unique and requires more than just a little concentration to do well. If puzzle-y games are not your cup of tea, stay away. But if they are, this is a really good one.

I'll echo others in saying that the instructions are pretty much useless. You will have to watch a video to learn the game. It's not exactly difficult to learn; more that the mechanics are utterly alien to me (which is not a bad thing). I imagine that additional plays will see me much more on the ball for advancing rounds and knowing when I've taken my allotted actions, but I feel certain I fudged on these in solving the first room. On a happy note, the components are beyond excellent. Hefty chips, substantial, silky cards, and, because I got the deluxe mat, an amazing mat of just the right size and heft, with sewn edges (not to mention the tube the game is stored in). I'm anticipating that my rating will increase with familiarity, but for now it's just "OK".

Once you realize how it plays it is a really easy game to pick up and teach. Its worth a buy.

The rules are not well written and leave a lot to interpretation.
Exciting game though. I like it better 1 v 1 than solo, even though it is interesting solo too.
Despite the boxe's size, the game is rather difficult to grasp for new player and deceptively heavy.
The component quality is absurd, although the back of the cards is much more shiny than the front, which makes oversized story cards needlessly hard to read.
There is some shade variation between some cards, mostly traps and countermeasures. Also, two sides of the traps seem to provide the same effect that one is much easier to trigger than the other. Oversight?

Winning with straight points seems to be the main way though and I wish completing 5 diagrams was more important. A 15 points goal might have been more interesting. In the final turns it seems to be about the luck of the draw too much too.
Otherwise, trying to outsmart your opponent is really fun and the opponent handled me the game on a silver plate last game :)

I have a feeling that the game was a little rushed.

I do like the story a lot and it's written much better than the rules!

Not very good as a solo game since most of the characters will be useless and there is no way to recover from bad rolls. Gets worse with The Factory expansion, especially the horrific room 3 which is a total luckfest.

All glitter and no glow.

One of the games that I have enjoyed the most during 2017: with a production value that makes ASTOUNDING sound diminishing, this little box from Chip Theory Games comes packed with the best components that you can find nowadays in the board gaming world —not a surprise coming from the responsibles of 'Too Many Bones'.

To side with the coolness of everything that comes out of the box —or the plastic tube, if you are one of the fortunate ones who has that gorgeous tube— this abstract puzzle of a game makes 15 minutes seem like 45 once you get into its core and try to defeat yourself —great solitaire mode, by the way— or your opponent.

Already said it: one of the best gaming experiences from this year.

The immersive atmosphere generated by the high quality components and background stories, makes you think this game should offer the player more than it does.
This has the negative affect of not meeting players' expectations.

Realistically it is a small $25 game that gives a lot more fun than the price suggests.
I know the extra bits increases the price dramatically, but that is down to the component quality and less expensive options would have been nice in this area (pdf or normal cards).

The number of diagrams provides good variety to both solo and multiplayer gameplay, despite the solo challenges being finite.
Discovering the optimum Character to use for each solo challenge is fun but also the main area where your choices are limited.
However there is a tonne of fun here that easily competes with similarly priced games.  

Chip Theory Games (CTG) tends to utilize luck as a method to increase difficulty in their games.
A lot of solo players hate this, because it is a lazy method, it can give mixed results and will leave differing impressions depending on the luck experienced.
Although CTG never make it the the main difficulty method and rarely use it more than a few times in in the campaign or scenario list, it makes it hard to quantify the game.

There are definitely some scenarios in Triplock that require skill and give you an excellent game where you find strategies and ways to offset the luck inherent in a dice/card-draw mechanic. 
This is one of the reasons I like the game so much and I play it often.
However there is the occasional scenario where luck plays a bigger role and strategy or skills will not prevent a loss, no matter how hard you try.

Personally I don't mind a bit of indiscriminate havoc to mess with your plans ... and I think CTG has struck a nice balance with there games, but I can understand players who think this breaks the game.

I really wanted to like this game. It has very good quality components but :

1. Rulebook is a mess. i read it and had NO idea what to do. Had to watch 2-3 different videos to understand what the game is about. I almost sold it after reading the rules twice. Note that I play Mage Knight and Anachrony regularly so complex games do not scare me usually.

2. It's very puzzly. I thought I enjoyed that but I guess not. 

3. The lockpicking theme feels like it was slapped on. At no moment do you feel like you are picking a lock.

I just put it on sale as I write this review.

I have a prototype copy which has  excellent quality components, almost up to the final standard. The setup and gameplay is very fast, which means you can play again and again, with little hassle.

Kickstarter. I backed for "first shipment", but they forgot to send me the game. When I eventually got it it was only a few days before the second shipment - which was now an upgraded version with revised cards and rules (16 pages rulebook instead of 12). I felt cheated. It took a few days before I wanted to play it. When I did I was disappointed. It a simple memory-puzzle. You need to remember the position of four chips and in what way they're flipped. Then move/flip them into desired patterns. You can also memorize the cover-chips (failsafes) but thats's really optional. I find it way too simple. It's too easy to remember where the chips are. There are many, many techniques to do this. I personally substitute the images with digits and it's all just a matter of remembering a four-digit number (or two four-digit numbers if I want to keep track of the failsafes). Moving things into position is then a simple puzzle to solve. I won every solo scenario at "challenge"-level on the first try. Boring. But it looks very nice and I will add one to the score for that. But it still stays at 3. Not my type of game.

Novel idea, great components, but not a game I would enjoy. It is guided by clever selection of actions on dice, but for me there is too much memory involved.

That being said, I can see that this can be a great game if you are into this sort of thing (puzzling and remembering). Nice thematic flavor on top, great components and I cannot think of any other game that already does this. Big thumbs up, but not a game for me.

Early Prototype copy.  Rating is STRICTLY based on the Solo mode.  
I was eagerly looking forward to another Chip Theory game, I knew very little going into it.  I was lucky enough to receive a prototype of the game in the mail and have been playing it a lot.  For a game that is essentially 12 chips ,2 dice and a couple special powers (the characters skills) it has a HUGE amount of replay value.  Yes, there is a memory aspect, so if that doesn't work for you, you may want to avoid this. (this isn't a game to play while watching a movie or tv)  I found it utterly engaging, and really enjoy it.  Don't worry about the dice aspect, if they're terrible rolls, you can spend both dice to take a single other action. 
It's difficult and luck can absolutely be a factor but your decisions are as important. Fantastic game, looking forward to the final production copy and the add on showing up!

Oh man, what did I get myself into? A memory game with twisty shuffling stacks, dice and cards? And all in sturdy "play at the beach" compatible materials? First play shows a neat little memory game with some fun twists. Rules are a bit obtuse and you really need to go through the motions to make sense of them. Got it for the solo play only and it delivers there, as the rooms all play very different from each other. I still need multiple tries at a room, so no chance on a campaign, but it is lots of fun. Quick setup, quick and engaging play, and a novel mechanism - I like it a lot.

A nice little filler game that fits its niche perfectly. The components are great, too.

Im still not quite sure about this one. It has gorgeous components and the game is very clever and unique. However I dont know if Id call it fun. It hurts my brain with all the memory and thinking so many turns ahead. Maybe I just need to be in a different state of mind. Or maybe in the back of my head im just too excited for too many bones to arive in the mail to appreciate this gem yet. Will rate later after a few more tries

I love the design and the components. Really cool world that has been presented and I'm excited for the solo levels to come out. However playing it vs. Is fun, but it's handicapped by the fact that you can know what's on one side of the chip based on what's on the side you see. That lack of  randomness takes something out of the game that it really needs. It's a decent game with that fault. If that was fixed it would be a better game.

I played 2 room cards, this game would test your memory and thinking, especially when the room's ability is triggered to rotate, flip the stacks and disrupt your plan lol.

 A lot of times you can't you use the 3 actions you are suppposed to do in a solo game.
Cards are very difficult to read.

Oof, I think this is a gorgeous game, an interesting premise, but probably not for me. Maybe it's better 2p than 1p, but that core mechanism mechanism (see what I did there?) is more weird than interesting. My main gripe is rolling dice to see what I can do. It means that you usually have to use the pair as a wild, or get 1 useful thing — rarely both are useful — on your turn. 1p, I have usually need 2 useful and very specific actions on my turn in order to accomplish things before the very dumb [but not fiddly] AI makes a mess of things.

Components are pretty great, and the box is gorgeous, inside and out. I was quite surprised to find that the chips not only don't interlock at the edges, but also have very narrow lips (maybe 1mm?), so they don't sit as stably atop one another as you'd like for a hidden mechanism game mechanism.

I haven't given up on it quite yet, but I think this is just an innovative idea outside my happy zone.

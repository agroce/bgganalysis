This is one of the best trick taking games in my collection. The fact that everyone's bids are in front of you, this makes for interesting cardplay. Do you lead your power cards and confirm your bids or hang back and try to hose someone else. Everyone who trys this loves it. I've yet to play Wizard ever since I picked this up. Can't wait for SimplyFun to print this one in English this summer.

I grew up playing "Oh Hell" (which we called "Up and Down the River"), a Whist variant.  It's a nastier, more interesting game than something like Hearts or Spades because of the precision required in betting.  You have to take *exactly* the number of tricks you bet, or you get nothing.

Die Sieben Seigel makes things even more interesting by exposing the suits of the tricks you plan on taking, which gives information about your hand to the other players and likewise lets you read into their hands.  It's not about "who can score the most points", but rather "who gets screwed the least".  In fact, for this reason scores are always negative.  The person with the least negative score wins.

It's a great, interesting trick taking game with a high degree of screwage and player interactivity.

After reading the rules it sounds like it's nothing special. But it is. The use of tokens is a very elegant way to keep track of scoring and what an opponent wants. The designer has wisely resisted the temptation to add strange rules to the cardplay, making this a game that's easy to explain and understand. If you like trick-takers, you'll like this game.

RATING: 6
A straightforward trick-taker in which players bid the number of tricks they will take in each suit. One player may choose to play the saboteur, with the object of helping others to win tricks they did not bid for. The saboteur is the only thing that raises this game slightly above the mundane, but in my experience it is too difficult to avoid penalty points when playing him.

Very solid game in the family of "Oh Hell."  I love the bidding and gameplay but the saboteur role seems to easy with a max damage of 4 points.  The rules recommend that it be bumped to 5 with 3P, but my group uses it with 4P or 5P and still finds that the saboteur is a hotly-contested role.  We'll keep playing, and I'll keep revising my opinion on that.  Makes me want to replay Sticheln.

RATING: 5
Semmi köze a wizardhoz (bár a szerző és a kiadó ugyanaz), de (gondolom) a wizard sikerére való tekintettel átkeresztelték wizard extreme-re, és ezen az új néven is kiadták. A leírás alapján jobbnak tűnt, mint a Wizard. De játszva nem jobb. Könnyed, bárkivel játszható, változatosabb is, mint az "elődje". Majdhogynem partijáték. Túlságosan is. Nekem kicsit már kaotikus, bár annyi fix van benne, hogy szinte minden helyzetben megéri a feketemágust választani, ha még nem vitte el más:) Míg az eredeti wizardban ösztönözve vagyunk az ütésekre, ez a játék csak a bekkelésről szól (nincs plusz pont, csak büntetés). A wizard sokkal komolyabb játék.
---
Az utolsó partikban bizonyos pontkülönbség felett a fekete mágus választása kötelező az élen állónak (ha más nem viszi el), mivel legrosszabb esetben is 4 minusz pontot jelent, elég nagy előnynél ez automatikusan a győzelmét is jelenti. Ez kicsit elronthatja (céltalanná teheti) az utolsó leosztásokat!! Fekete mágus nélkül komolyabb játék lenne, de így érdekesebb...

This is a surprisingly good game. The best trick-taking game I've played and you really need to think about the meta-game and try getting inside other player's heads to win. And that is just with the normal announcing how many tricks you will take, then there is the saboteur role, which add a whole new level. This is also simple enough for more casual players, but "deep filler" for hc-boardgamers.

An interesting idea for a trick-taking game.  Players are starting each round in the hole and trying to dig their way out.  The game feels like it can be a bit nasty for my family, because there are several opportunities to steal tricks other players are counting on.  I also am stumped about what is the best way to play the Zinger role.  Overall, it's a unique trick-taking game, but not one that will rise to the top of our most-played list.

I have always been a fan of trick-taking games, particularly Wizard/Oh Hell.  This is definitely the best variant.  However, IMO, trick-taking has worn thin.  The same basic card play tactics hold true throughout.  The game is therefore interesting only as you explore the new twist.

Fairly standard trick-taking game, but you have to predict the suits of the tricks that you think you will win.  Moderate learning curve... best to play a practice hand or two, esp. with newbies.  Seems like it's almost safest to take the saboteur every time... therefore, this game fell flat for me.  Also, in both 4-er games, we never used the ? tokens.  I wonder if the game is better with fewer tokens (maybe one less of each color) or without the saboteur.

Kickstarted

Trick taking games are one of my favorite types to play, and Sluff Off! carries on in the tradition. This is a fairly standard trick taking game, with a trump color. Game play is really changed by the addition of the scoring mechanic. Basically at the beginning of the round your bidding on how many tricks of a particular color you're going to win. If you bid but don't win the trick you end up taking negative points. The player with the fewest negative points wins.

While I'm warming up to trick taking games a little bit, I still don't really enjoy the ones where you have to call out what tricks you intend to take for the round, which is the premise of Sieben Siegel.  It also seemed like whoever took the Sabateur had the least to lose, since the most points he could end up with is 4.  Taking just one wrong trick for any other player is 3 points, so it seems like a good deal to just take the Sabateur when possible.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I really didn't like the game well enough to play it more and find out.

RATING: 6
I can never remember the name of this game after I've played it, or when ever I want to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a clever little trick taker that feels like a particularly evil version of Spades, as you have to bid on the exact suits you are going to score. Instead of bidding, you can choose to be the Saboteur - negating negative points you would incur from winning tricks, but you lose 4 points right away and instead you receive points for any tricks your opponents take over their bids. Figuring out when to take the Saboteur and how to play it is the big draw when you first start playing the game.

As fun as this game is (and is!), I think it could have used a little balance work. Sloughing feels too rewarding - there's no reward for taking more tricks vs. less, so you just bid what you've got in your hand and it makes strategies pretty straightforward as there's no incentive to really take risks.

Additionally, the saboteur feels a little OP. It doesn't always make sense to grab him, of course, but at the very least it feels like anyone with a commanding lead should not be able to take him.

Still, if you like trick takers and you like trying to screw over your friends it's definitely a worthwhile time.

FWIW, I prefer the card art from the Die Sieben Siegel version but it's hard to find it in a sensible box size. Wizard Extreme wins out in this case.

Has some nice twists on trick-taking, which is a favorite genre for my group.  Players must bid for the number of tricks they'll take AND the color of the trick.

I enjoyed my first play, but I'm not convinced there is enough control. Bidding early is too harsh.

Still searching for the ideal player count.  I think it is four players, but it might be three or four or even five. Pleasantly nasty.  In many ways this offers the pleasurable malice and planning of Sticheln, just in a somewhat more refined and divisive package (but also less brutally cutting, which is a shame).  Unlike Sticheln score swings tend to be small and advantages tend to accrue slowly.

RATING: 4
Basically take Spades, but then make the bidding colour specific and increase the deck to 5 suits of 15. The object is to only bid what one is going to take, and to throw away the rest, staying as low as possible. Unlike Spades there is no incentive to bid high (0 is the highest you can score, indicating that you took only those books which you bid, and no extra), or to go for it (Flight does this in Spades, goading teams into bidding 10 because it can double the points gained) and major incentives to underbid viciously and then try to feed books to the other people at the table. 

After years of Spades, where there is a strong incentive to carefully squeeze extra books out of your hand this felt easier and less textured because there is no incentive to play creatively to get the extra book, and IMO it's always easier to toss away books than to take them, especially so in Die Steven because of the extra suit in the deck. 

The special saboteur role throws things for a loop though, as their only object in the game is to feed you books that you didn't bid, and this can make bidding very, very difficult at times as cards that wouldn't otherwise walk are often forced to by the saboteur, but are also still in danger from being as bad as they should be, if said saboteur can't influence the trick enough. 

I like idea that this game seems to have, that of combinining Spades and Hearts, but after having played it with 3 and 5, I have to say that this is a non-5 scale game for me...the game might hypothetically support it, but I think the game sucked viciously at that scale, and I would rate that a 2-3. The 3 scale was decently solid though, with the understanding that the saboteur needs to give away 5 books, not 4, and that the play order keeps reversing so that one has to deal with both opponents directy during the course of the game. The saboteur, even made harder with the extra book requirement, is more interesting and useable at the lower scale, while at the high scale it felt impossible to influence tricks enough. I need to play this with 4 yet, but I'm also concerned about the viability of the saboteur there as well. Basically, unless the saboteur is useable the game is bland, with it, the bidding is more tricky and much more fun for it; and even in the 3 player game, where the saboteur has a decent amount of control, I still felt that this game was lacking. I really have had no desire to play this game again since getting to 3 player standouts Eidex and Flaschenteufel...or even Schnappchen Jagd for that matter.

I love this game.  Now, keep in mind that I LOVE trick taking games - especially Spades.  I love the partnership aspect of Spades, but I realize that a lot of people don't.  So this game allows you to get the feel of spades but you are all on your own.  That also means that there is no one to help you.  You are on your own. :)  

An interesting twist is that you have to bid on how many tricks you will take in each suit/color.  I think since you don't have the partnership aspect, they really needed something like this to spice this game up.  Another benefit to playing this game vs. Spades is that you can play with 3, 4, or 5 instead of just with 4.

I'm undecided about the traitor.  I think it is a little too powerful because it saves poor players from taking more than 4 negative points - which they probably would.  But since only one person can take it in a round I suppose it is fine.  It kind of helps to let a newbie take the traitor so they can see how the round goes and not have to worry much about if they take tricks or not. And I prefer not to take it because it is more fun for me to have the challenge of making my bid.

Anyway.  A thumbs up for me.  I would play it any day.

[Die Sieben Siegel] I'm usually less fond of "make your bid exactly" trick-takers, but I really like this one, despite (or perhaps because) of the requirement to predict which suits you'll win tricks in as well.

While I can believe the Saboteur is balanced with experienced players, at less experienced tables bidding for it seems to be the way to go. (Min bid 4.)

RATING: 8
See my (old) [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/35410]review[/url].

Since that time, the game has stood up pretty well. I appreciate how it rewards accurate prediction and decent play over good cards, as opposed to many other trick-taking games (ahem, Tichu). The scoring structure really does reward aggressive bidding and equally aggressive play. The saboteur is the only element I have mixed feelings about. It adds a much needed element of mischief into a game that otherwise threatens to devolve into a cooperative exercise, but it's scoring structure bugs. It's too valuable and safe when even one new player is in the mix and the rounds become less predictable; it becomes far less interesting for experienced players who can assess hands relatively accurately, leaking some of the tension out of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Production: The artwork is attractive, simple, and functional.  But the card quality is a mere average, a far cry from the usual slam-dunk by Amigo; they have obviously made a quality-vs.-cost decision, and steered away from the stellar linen-finished cards by which I've come to measure all other cards.  What a shame.

Play: It is fun to try to predict, down to the color, the tricks I will take.  Even with a larger hand of cards than in most rounds of Wizard, this game is easier for me to make exact predictions, perhaps because of the color specificity.  I like trick-taking games in general, and this entry, though not revolutionary, kept my interest. (2+2+4) (2 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It gets a Top Shelf rating just for the bidding, the suspense of playing out a hand and the thrill of getting a score of 0 on a challenging hand. As a competitive strategy game, it falls short of other top-notch trick-taking games. Like many other card games, there are easy hands to play and difficult hands to play; the presence or non-presence of low cards is typically the main factor here. However, there aren't enough hands in a match to counter this variance. Additionally, the opportunities to effectively target a specific player are too rare (contrast with Hearts). That said, this is the trick-taking game we play the most.

Straight forward tricktaking game with all cards dealt (ie all cards known). Only twist is calculating exactly what number and type of tricks you will take. Going late in the hand is very useful as prior players reveal thier intentions. Choosing the sabatour seems a bit too obvious until players learn to co-operate against it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As in Wizard and Oh Hell!, you predict the tricks you will take before each round, and you're penalized either for overbidding or for underbidding. In Die Sieben Siegel, the prediction includes the suits of the winning cards, so you're still hosed if you take the correct number of tricks but in the wrong suits. Of course, you can avoid all that stress by selecting the saboteur.

Hearts with an overpowered Saboteur included. Not impressed. We play with a house rule that the Saboteur gets all 6 black disk when he picks the role and then the other players take discs from him. Each disc is only worth 1 point, not 3 to him. Still powerful but not ridiculously so.

Zing! was a bit of a relevation to me, being the second trick taking game I was introduced to, and one that I found to be generally superior to Poison. The game itself is decision rich, fun, and pretty easy to teach, but only with one particular modification: The removal of the Zinger. While this removes the games namesake, and probably its main reason for existing, it seems to improve the game for the most part, turning it into my second favorite filler game (behind Race For the Galaxy.)

Zing! is probably the game that I have had the most luck in introducing to non-gamers I know. Even my friend Vanessa, who just doesn't get games in general, seems to survive and have fun with Zing, even when she doesn't win.

It's been about a year and half since I've played this, so my memory on it is quite hazy. I remember finding the game a little too restrictive. Most track-taking games seem restrictive to me compared to Stichlen because in most trick-taking games you have to follow suit if you can. I remember you had to try and predict the tricks of various colours you would take. That was interesting, but there are other quick 4-player games I would rather play than this one. Sorry that I'm not more articulate with this one.

There's a couple of things I really liked about this game. First, I like the fact that missing contracts are not negatively punished. If you're thinking "whoa, he's wrong!" after reading that hear me out. In a game like Wizard, a player gains positive points for making a contract, while you lose points for missing a contract. So in effect, you are losing double the points for missing a bid. Since Die Sieben Siegel only penalizes you for missing points, and not rewarding you for making bids there's none of that double whammy effect. The net result is you're not completely out of the game by botching a single bid, but generally players will need to hit bids to win still. 

The other thing about Die Sieben Siegel that is interesting is the role of a saboteur. It's a good addition to a more traditional rule set. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Way more predictable than Wizard, because you know all the card-values that are in play, and because there are no wizard and fool cards in the deck. This makes for a pretty different gameplay feeling, without the big swings and big emotions like in Wizard. More subtle, but still entertaining.

E•G•G Series #9

Originally called: Die Sieben Siegal, and published under the names Wizard Extreme, and also Zing.

See my pictorial review: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1691943

An exact bidding game along the lines of Oh Hell.  Brilliant, exciting, tense, and fun game that departs from other bidding/trick-takers:
1. Uses bidding tokens
2. Saboteur/Sluffer role
3. Five suits
These elements create a higher level of tension, excitement and fun in playing out a hand, because every trick matters.

- Part of the beauty of this game is that it isn't pure luck: the quality of your hand is not directly connected to your ability to win. All that matters is how well you bid your hand and how well you play your cards.
- The Saboteur/Sluffer role:  Adds element of chaos, prevents pure calculation.  Although I prefer to call the "Sluffer" by its original name: The Saboteur.  I'm not crazy on the terminology/theme of the EGG edition, although artwork/graphic design looks fine.  Recommended to play with 5 points for this role in 3 player game.

One potential issue is that the same person can keep taking the Sluffer token.  Possible variants to solve this:
- Escalate the cost of the Saboteur when taken multiple times. So, the first time you take him in a game, the score is 4-black tokens, the second time it's 5-black tokens, the third 6-black tokens and so on. 
- Don't allow the player in the sole lead to take the saboteur. (if already ahead by more than 4 points in the last hand, if the leader takes the saboteur then the last hand is moot).

(3-5 players) I like trick-taking games and this is one. And like most there's a degree of chaos involved and this one is no different.  That said, it didn't exactly wow me. Basically Oh Hell with a gimmick.  Playing the saboteur well takes a degree of subtlety and finesse that I don't have yet.

A standard trick-taking game with a nice contract method and a twist that fails. Didn't like this much, but not because I'm total crap at contract tricks. Rather, the twist is that instead of bidding, you can be a Traitor, and try to screw over the other players.That's fine, but if you fail to do any damage, the worst points you lose is -4, whereas if you fail to meet your contract, you can lose a ton. So if you have a comfortable lead, then take the Traitor option regardless of your hand, and you can't lose.

If you like contract tricks games, you'll love this. Me, not so.

I really enjoyed this trick taking card game.  I've only played the 3 player version, which I don't think is ideal.  4 or 5 should be better, and 5 should be best.  The white seals were never used in our game, and the sabateur was used 3 out of the 6 rounds.  We did make him worth -5 as he was very valuable, and always the sabateur ended up with more points than the others.  Even with a few flaws, I really loved the game.  It has a lot of tension, and the theme is really interesting.  I will definitely bring this out more, and especially want to try with 5.

Played 2 times. Neat twist on trick taking, but still a numbered trick game. Some neat ideas, but nothing I got excited about. I neat less numbers in my card games to really enjoy them (a la Frank's Zoo). This reminded me too much of Rage. Sort of chaotic, trying to call tricks, not enough control, no theme. Nothing against the game though -- for what it is, it is very good, just not my type of game. See also Flaschenteufel, which others enjoy, but I find to be an average trick game. Again, numbered trick taking just doesn't hold my interest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is the kind of trick taking card game I love.  There is a good chance it will make it to 10.

There are other card games such as Wizard and Spades where you predict the tricks you will be taking.  But this is more refined with further determining the number in each of 5 suits (colors), and with the addition of an official saboteur who by the way, can do no wrong. 

I can't think of another game where 0 points is the highest and best score you can get.  There are no positive points ever won in the game.

A variation on the trick taking with trump genre.  However, the twists in this game are interesting enough to bring us back to play again and again.  The saboteur has a much harder job than you would think and planning the entire hand from the start is difficult at best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a fun and tense trick taking game with a couple of twists. You have to bid your hand correctly, because failing to take a trick you claim is painful, but taking one you didn't want is even worse. So what if your hand is just plain terrible? Play the Saboteur, and set out to stick other players with the tricks they don't want. There is a lot to manage in this game, a lot to keep track of, for a trick taking card game.

A solid trick-taking game along the lines of Wizard. You must predict how many tricks you'll win in each colour, and an incorrect prediction results in a penalty. Points accumulate more slowly than in Wizard, and you cannot make a huge leap with a single great hand which makes this a slightly better game.

We found this game at Goodwill.  It's called Zing! in English.  I wasn't much interested in it, but my husband bought it because the cards and pieces were still shrink wrapped.  It's sat around for a year because I had never heard of SimplyFun game company.  Finally, my husband did some more research and found out this game is a Spiel des Jahres nominee and sold by Amigospiel.  These are two names/phrases I recognize.  All I know is this game was marketed all wrong in the U.S.  SimplyFun should not be allowed to touch Spiel des Jahres nominees if they don't know how to give the games proper credit and promotion.  I'm looking forward to trying the game now.

I understand why the trick-taking fanatics like this one - and the game was enhanced with the "requirement" that whenever "Dancing Steven" forced someone to take a black sigil that he, well... danced.

Another trick-taking game that I really suck at. I think I'm beginning to see a pattern. It's no Where's Bob's Hat, but I'm still upholding the tradition of finishing last. I like the added element of taking the seals to essentially represent a bid and penalties for failing to take the corresponding tricks. That mechanic adds some depth that is lacking in other trick-taking games and makes this one a bit more interesting--and challenging. Anyone who can finish a game with zero points is a real pro at the genre, that's for sure. The winner in our first game finished with minus nine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A trick-taking game where you predict beforehand not just how many tricks you plan to take, but what KIND you're going to take.  The game mechanic actively encourages trying to mess up other peoples bids as you make your own, so may not be a good selection for some.

RATING: 9
It's a five-suited game of Oh Hell! in which the entire deck is used each hand and players must predict not only how many tricks they will take, but which colors those tricks will be.  It takes a lot of skill to play well, yet it's not as brain-melty as some of the other card games fitting that description.  Which is kind of a nice combination.  Compared to something like Wizard, this is geared more toward serious card game afficionados, and would be less suitable for casual players.  Die Sieben Siegel has become a staple in our group, and it's a great choice for those who enjoy trick-taking games.  As suggested at the end of the rulebook, the saboteur should definitely score 5 rather than 4 in games with three players.  We haven't found any other adjustments to be necessary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This one should be a classic.  The saboteur isn't really useful with more than 3 players, but this game is in the same calibre as hearts and spades except it seems more dynamic.

After hundreds of plays I'm actually raising my rating.  This game has a lot of staying power.  And now I'm raising it again!  Even non-gamers get into this game.  It's amazing how receptive people are to playing this game.

If I really recorded all my plays I'd be at 1000s of plays now.  I almost want this game to go away so I can play other stuff.

You can play 6 player perfectly fine by using a Sticheln deck, the same 5 colours and numbers up to 18.

Five plays with four players and three plays with five. Fantastic! My favorite trick-taking game so far. Unusual in that the emphasis is on screwing your opponents rather than winning tricks for yourself. Definitely a game for cutthroat players rather than passive ones, though; it'll probably fall flat with an overly friendly group or one that's not adept at trick-taking games. The key is in understanding that the game is not so much about correctly guessing which tricks you're going to take — something that is not really that difficult if everyone is doing the exact same thing — as figuring out how to use your hand to make your opponents take more or fewer tricks than they were expecting, [i]even if you're not the saboteur[/i].

It plays fine with five, which is a nice plus, though it might be better with four, just because it's a little tougher to keep straight what's in people's hands with five.

Ok but the twist of the saboteur didm't quite work for me. It seems that unless you have the ultimate killer hand (is that possible?) then you take the saboteur if possible. A max of 4 points with a strong likelyhood of less seems a pretty good deal.

I have to admit I never really had much experiene with trick taking games.  I used to play hearts ages ago, but I'm still a little rusty.  When a friend brought out Zing! to play, I was a bit tentative.   On the first two rounds, I admit I was a little bit lost.  I apparently had such a great hand in the first, I could've inflicted major damage to the other opponents.  I didn't mind that so much.  The game seemed rather fun once I understood how it worked in the 3rd/4th round.  

I think it would take more plays for me to see if the game will stick.  My rating is just based on my first experience.

First played November 27th, 2007. Taught in ~5min and played in about an hour with 4 players. This trick-taking game has a good balance of strategy and luck. You make a bid of how many tricks you take by taking a token of the corresponding color, however there are only three of each non-trump suit and 5 of trump. If you run out, you take one from someone and give them a ?. When you take tricks you return them to the middle and each token at the end costs you points. You must follow suit. You take a trick by either playing the highest card 1-15 in a suit or highest trump. The lead card determines which trick you "took". If you take with a trump, you may also return a red token in stead. Taking a trick you didn't expect gives you a black chip which is -3. ?'s are -4, others are -2. You may also bid the saboteur which gives you -4 if you don't "force" a unwanted trick on anyone, however, for each one forced, you gain a point, with a max of zero. It's a good game that I'd recommend giving a try, especially if you know someone who has it. Perhaps consideration in purchase.

Apr09:  I really just wan't impressed with this one very much.

After people made their bids, there just seemed to be way too much incentive to take what you bid and that be that.  And you bid down to the very trick.

I actually prefer just bidding a total number of tricks in general, since that allows for some skill in counting some cards as half tricks and averaging out how many you plan on taking in total.

I'll give it another go, but it just didn't impress me.  The Saboteur was interesting, but seemed almost broken as written.  Why wouldn't you just always take the Saboteur unless you had no way of avoiding taking tricks...

I'll stick to Sticheln, Tichu, Spades and Oh Hell at this point.

RATING: 8
This is "Evil Spades"

2 big differences here though which are both a plus and welcomed change from regular Spades.

 - This is not a team game. I love team games which add a whole new dynamic to a game, this is missing that but gives you the chance to play the same kind of game as an individual.

 - The Saboteur. Instead of bidding for how many tricks you might take you can take the Saboteur role which means your only goal for that round is to try and screw over the other players! Fun stuff. 

Another difference here is that instead of saying you will get "5" tricks, you have to say WHICH tricks you will take which is much more specific and tougher to pull off. 

We had a couple of concerns in our 4 player game. One was being able to lead trump without it being 'broken' first, I didn't see anything in the rules about it, small detail. The other was the Saboteur seemed like the best choice or the easiest way not to take points, I think he should probably start with -5 instead of -4, more experience might prove that wrong however. I really like the idea of 'bidding' for the role starting at 4, if someone else now wants it they can bid 5 which is how many negative points they will start with. How many negatives the Saboteur should start with largely depends on player count too, see variant threads. 

All in all a welcome addition to the trick taking genre and one of my favourites that does not involve point cards, really one of the best for straight trick-taking with a great twist.

Pretty demanding trick taking game, but saboteur rules are a little weird
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game very much like wizard, with 2 important differences:  all 15 cards are always used (in a 5 player game) and players have to indicate how they are going to take the tricks they bid for (i.e.-colour).

One other twist is the use of the 'Saboteur.'  BY taking this little fellow, you start off with a 4 point penalty... and try to give the points away to the other players.

A good variant (found on Dorra's web site) is to bid for the Saboteur, starting with 4.  So if another player wants to take the Saboteur, he has to up the bid to 5 or more.

This won't replace Wizard as my favourite trick bidding game, but it's close.

RATING: 6
* Kickstarted! *

A trick taking game with the catch that you must bid ahead of time on which colour tricks you can get (and get penalized for each mistake) OR you can bet on not getting the right amount and let others weaken the penalty. Decent, easy to play… but not something that we found you'd rush out compared to other games.

PLUS: easy to learn, challenge of predicting
MINUS: not much beyond bid and try to make it

Kind of reminds me of Oh Hell in that you're trying to decide how many tricks you are going to take in the current round. Otherwise a pretty standard trick taking game.

RATING: 7
Superior trick-taking game. I really enjoy having to set my own goals for the hand so precisely. Adding the saboteur creates a nice wild card that you need to account for. I don't know if the game is mean, per se, but players should do what they can to meet their bids - no more and no less! It could be that I never play with experienced enough players, but I like the Finnish variant, where the Saboteur starts with -5 points rather than -4. With players who are not excellent bidders, -4 is too safe a choice. Maybe one day I'll reach a point where -4 is the risky move...

Another good light trick-taking game.  It's not quite as evil as I anticipated.  In most other trick-taking games, everyone else is out to get you as well.  I guess the only added element is that the saboteur has no other job to do than to mess you up, whereas the other players still have to take the tricks that they predicted while trying to mess you up.  Still, most hands don't allow for that much screwage, though I guess having an ideal hand would cause some fun damage.  Maybe it doesn't seem that mean because there isn't the possibility of scoring positive points - everyone scores negative points at some time.

RATING: 6
Played once.

I enjoy playing trick taking games and I have played quite a few games of Spades and a home game which is similar to Die Sieben Siegel.  After playing it once I have the following opinions:

+  Saboteur is a great idea.
+  Bidding for specific color tricks is an interesting idea.
-  The game doesn't seem to reward all hands.  It is true that all games will have bad hands, but I think a design should reward hard hands with better scores.  In DSS, it is much harder to estimate correctly if you have good trick taking potential, but you don't get a better score if you estimate correctly.
-  I'd rather see the saboteur be a high risk/high reward proposition rather than the limited loss.  I think for beginning players the saboteurs penalty should start at 5 or 6 to encourage learning how to play the basic game correctly.  Once the average scores drop below 3, then lower the saboteur penalty.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As the game was explained to me it sounded quite a lot like Wizard, because of the function of stating how many tricks you're going to take. The actual gameplay also wasn't anything too special, only the role of saboteur felt like something original, but I wouldn't be surprised if that had already been included in some overly complex (German) trick taking game, too.

Nice trick-taking game. I played about 10 games and then other games always seemed more interesting.

In terms of playing the hands this reminds me a lot of David & Goliath.

It's a trick taking game where you try to predict your trick and where you can get the saboteur if you have a bad hand and want to screw people over.

The only bad thing about it is that the scoring is very confusing which makes the game hard to play. But it can probably easily be modified.

RATING: 9
This is a cross between Spades & Wizard and IMO features a much better, more improved scoring system (especially the Sabateur).  It impinges upon you to make as accurate bids as possible.  Some like to bid for the Sabateur but I don't mind playing it straight as per written rules.  A rare trump game that plays great with 5 plyrs.  Since I really loved Spades, the twists that are added to this new bidding & scoring method makes it wonderfully different and a great play - excellent for a weekly card game night, or as a card game filler.  And, you could still play Spades with a DSS deck.  Along with Mu, one of my favority 5-player trick taking games.

Quite good card game. One of those in which you have to play like a hundred times to fully develop your intuitive playing style. It's quite hard to predict what cards you will be taking and you have to do it very precisely. Most of the time just taking the saboteur is much easier. =)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This rating is a little harsh, but technically correct. By the rules as written, the Saboteur does not function correctly. It works as well as a way to avoid taking more than 4 penalty points as well as or better than it does as a safety valve for a weak hand.

With a fix for the saboteur, though Sieben Siegel is a neat trick taking game that is an interesting spin on the Oh Hell!/Ninety-Nine family, since you are predicting which colours you will take tricks in, not just how many tricks you will take. This changes the tempo and texture of play enough to make it stand out as a distinctive experience.

I would probably rate it an 8, maybe even a 9 with a fix. My group will be experimenting to see what we can come up with.

What a bizzare and evil trick taking game.  Painful, even.  That is what makes it fun, though.

My rating has dropped from a 6 to a 4 because I have seen too many games swing one player from winning to losing due to factors that are not possible to predict.  In a five player game, if you have the 8 and the 11 in yellow, you can't reasonably expect to win a yellow trick, but if the cards end up in the wrong hands, it is all too easy to take a yellow trick anyway, which can't be accounted for in bidding and has too large of an impact on the results of the game for me to enjoy it.

After taking 5 blue tricks in the last hand, swinging my score from -1 to -13, I have to say that I think less of this game each time I play it.  I think one more play may push my score down to 3.

Well, I played it again and made a swing from -1 to -12 in the last hand due to a horribly unpredictable hand.  

Based on 5+ plays with 4 and 5 players.

Trick taking, like Wizard, but better -for me- because:
-All the cards are dealt in each round
-You get only negative points if you don't fulfill your bet (which also involves colours). That means that a player is expected to play his hand well and the most points do not go to the one with the most high-valued cards in hand.

Great trick taking fun. Really tough bidding mechanic ensures that you'll probably get screwed, the question is just how much.

This is my favorite trick taking game of all time. (Well, perhaps equal with Sticheln. Nah, this is marginally better.) A great combination of bidding and card play, and with Rupert thrown in. What makes this great is that you react to the cards you're dealt by predicting the tricks you'll take, so getting a crummy hand isn't the disaster that it normally is in a trick taking game.

One of the best trick takers.  Only two real strikes against it.  First, the saboteur is not really able to affect things a whole lot, in my experience.  Second, it's possible for somebody to basically fall out of the game if they play poorly, not even through their own fault.  Not a game-killer, but I've seen it happen.

Very intriguing negative-scoring trick-taking game. Basically players bid for the number and colour of tricks they think they can win; they loose points for any over/under from that bid. I found the renegade's role to be very intriguing and an interesting twist. 
However, the game is too 'easy'. The 14 and 15 of each colours are basically the only ones that you should bother bidding up. Bidding for red is a little different, but not much. It's threshold too easy to get rid of unwanted cards and take no tricks (or just the right amount). The renegade is intriguing, but difficult to play with no clear-cut strategies or semi-obvious way to go about playing its hand. I'd like to play this again, but I'm not sure how much staying power it will have.

This is probably my favorite of the "guess how many tricks you win" trick-taking games. Both because the game comes with chits to keep track of your bet, and because the game has very straightforward rules. The Sluffer role seems a bit funky, but it actually works really well. I like this game because it takes the idea behind games like Wizard, and presents it in a package that has a low barrier to entry. Stefan Dorra can just do no wrong when it comes to trick-taking games, it seems.

Good trick taking game. Similar to Wizard, each player predicts the number of tricks they will take, but here, they must specify the suits as well and players take tokens to denote the tricks to plan to take. This game also introduces a "saboteur" who tries to disrupt people taking tricks. People with leftover tokens lose points, and if you inadvertenly take a trick you weren't supposed to take, you lose more points, while the saboteur gains points. Just as fun as Gang of Four, Frank's Zoo.

A nice variation on the trick-taking system. However, the saboteur option does not seem destructive enough to me, a very casual trick-taker. You have to calculate very carefully on the number of trump(red) cards in your hand in order to make the saboteur work, I think. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This looks like it may be the perfect 5-player trick taking game. With fewer players the seals are too numerous and the Saboteur is almost always a good play, though it's still a fun game. ***UPDATE*** For some reason, this game just doesn't play as well as it should. I think the scoring system needs to be looked at and overhauled. I'm not saying I have the answers, but...

RATING: 9
50+ plays. This has proved to be somewhat special as a 3-5 player closer for us. The spice of the Saboteur turns this variant of Oh Hell into a tenser game. We very early on moved to a variant whereby we bid for the Saboteur after the initial tile take, where the winner returns their initial tiles. The rules-based price is 1-2 points too low in practice. In this game, you don't so much care about the high cards - it's all about how much protection you have in the low cards and the suit spread across the players. If you have risk and you might end up winning tricks you didn't call, bid high for the Saboteur!

A light trick taking game where one player can play a saboteur and tries to get others to make mistakes or all players can simply decide how many tricks of what color they intend to make and lose points for every wrong guess.

My problem with this game is primarily that I don't like trick-taking card games, and this game requires each player to know how many tricks he or she can take in the round.  This bidding process is my least-favorite part of trick-taking card games (although remembering the concept of trump is a close second).  The one clever thing here is the Zinger, who is the person trying to make other players take more tricks than they planned.

Update: much played but sadly no longer appeals as I feel there are more entertaining/educational bidding trick takers.

I love the "holistic" gameplay of trick-taking and bought this in the hope it would suit 3 card counters(a rare niche); alas I'm finding play with 4 minimum more interesting. (I'd to see if white seals come into play more with 5 players). The unusual play(to me)is to predict which coloured tricks you'd win in a hand, which if successful means reducing penalty points, failure results in small scoring increments (rather than the disheartening large ones). So I'm finding scores are close and coupled with the pressured commitment of having to discard seals and avoid black ones promotes in me an adrenalin-fuelled attitude. Also the game is short to tolerate hopeless situations. My intial concern about the tactic of taking the saboteur at every opportunity is diminishing, with the feeling that more skilful players will make it a less viable option. Stefan Dorra has finally claimed a spot in my collection.

The bidding decisions in this game are tough - it's always a tough call how many chips to take.  I think the game scales well to different numbers of players.

Having played this game more often with different groups sizes still fell the saboteur is too powerful.  Often the first person bidding takes the saboteur before the cards are dealt.

The too few points placed at risk compared to the others hands is just too unbalanced.   Have yet to try any of the saboteur variants, but the rating goes down with each playings.

The simple rule change (bidding specific colors rather than just a number of tricks) added more depth that I had expected, but not as much as I had hoped.  It was a neat game, especially using the common house rule where players bid up the value of the saboteur.  However, it was not much different in the end from other similar games, so for me it is a solid game the design of which I appreciate but that I am not enthralled by.

My favorite of the Wizard-type games.  I like the fact that players aren't penalized for holding terrible hands (in fact, those can be the easiest hands to bid!), and I like the fact that the penalty for slightly misbidding is not all-or-nothing; this makes holding like the (equivalent of) the singleton king of trump much less painful.  The saboteur role is interesting; I've noticed that, as groups I've taught this to learn the game, it starts out considered powerful, gets weaker, then gets more powerful again.  There's still randomness here, but it's much easier to overcome than in similar games I've played.

This got us talking about bridge though the resemblance isn't strong. In both games you bid how many tricks you'll take, but in this one there are no teams, you won't know half the cards in the game if you got the bid and indeed no one 'gets' a bid - everyone pursues their own.

One of the most interesting tiny card games though, look forward to playing again.

Yet another in a very long line of trick taking games. What new inspiration in system trickiness does this game give us? Not much more than we've seen in games like Canyon. In terms of complexity and scoring cleverness it doesn't even come close to what you can get out of a simple pack of cards and a game of Skat or Doppelkopf. On the other hand, unlike Skat, there's far less luck in the cards over the short game and it's simple enough for everyone to become easily familiar with. I've grown to enjoy this one more and more. Bidding for the saboteur after all players have chosen their counters greatly improves the game.

I own Die Sieben Siegel, and those who think artwork / theme / components don't matter should examine the superiority of this German version to Zing!

This is like Spades with disaggregation, such that the end-result is like a mix of Spades and Hearts, or Spades without team play. The bidding on tricks has been split into colors, the teamwork aspect is removed (but it is compensated for with different decisions and player flexibility), and there is the SABOTEUR. I like this just as much as Spades because it retains a similar flavor while offering something different. Nicely stylized cards and solid, pretty wooden chits don't hurt.

[b]Update:[/b]
The light has gone out on this one after the 3rd play. The card play and strategy is exactly the same as that in Spades, and the only difference is in the bidding, so the game can be rote. Ultimately, the partnership element in Spades trumps any of the changes Die Sieben Siegel made, and I'd always prefer Spades to this if we have 4 players.

This means that this game would be the poison of choice for Spades fanatics who have 3 or 5 players instead of the 4 to divide into 2 teams.

BUT there's a fundamental problem with the game in the Saboteur. Spades, Tichu, Bridge etc keep the tension high for the 'Saboteur' player by making it hard to achieve your objective, and also make your payoff extremely risky (negative or positive points). The Saboteur has the former, but not the latter! In fact, taking the Saboteur is often the least risky choice for you! This means that it's in high demand, and is almost always what the start player always grabs. This means there's little point in picking the Saboteur, and you can just rotate it among players every game. Once you pick it up, there is little tension either, since the variance of your payoff is so small (0-4, as opposed to 0-12+ for other players). This can be remedied if every player at the table is experienced, but the presence of a single newbie can throw the game into chaos, more so than with other trick-taking games.

[COLOR=#663300][i]Note: My numeric ratings disregard BGG's associated verbal descriptions.[/i][/COLOR]

[COLOR=#006600][b]Comments: [/b][/COLOR]

Bidding on how many tricks in each suit one might take could be difficult to track, but the use of tokens cleverly simplifies and balances play.  [i]

Simplifies[/i] by making the remaining goals of all players visually obvious.  Taking tricks means one of two things:  either discarding negative tokens for tricks you've bid, or taking worse tokens for those you haven't.  [i]

Balances[/i] (during the bidding process) by allowing later bidders to take standard (-2) bid tokens from prior bidders with the trade-off that prior bidders receive wild (-4) tokens in exchange.  This provides balance because unlike standard tokens, which may be discarded only with tricks taken in the corresponding color, wild tokens can be discarded with any trick taken.

The Zinger adds a mild element of jeopardy which I find improves an already strong game.  When a player takes a trick but has no corresponding token to discard, he must take a penalty (-3) token.  The person who plays the Zinger role takes an automatic penalty of -4 points, but no matter how many tricks he takes, he takes no penalty tokens.  Furthermore, his penalty decreases by one point for every penalty token taken by other players.  The Zinger plays a key role, but that does not mean one should choose the role simply because the opportunity arises.  Barring an ideal hand, it's truly a safe choice only when you can take the Zinger role after having heard some other bids.  

I've seen this game described as a variant of [i]Skat[/i], [i]Oh Hell![/i], and [i]Spades[/i].  I have to say that the use of tokens and the Zinger role give this game a character all it's own among trick-taking games.

[i]Update 2008-02-05:[/i]  Okay, I gone and done it.  I raised the rating.  I have a feeling I'll be raising it again.  It's become one of those games we're all happy to play almost any time.

RATING: 7.5
Yes, we all refer to it as the 'Steven Segal' game. Go on, laugh at our poor command of the German language.

A slight variation to the trick taking genre. There are 5 colours with values 1-15. Red is always the trump colour. Once hands are dealt, players 'bid' on the quantity of ticks they'll win of the different colours. These are worth -ve points if they aren't completed. There's also a choice of taking a 'saboteur' role where you're trying to make players win tricks they didn't bid for. 

The game then proceeds in typical trick taking fashion. A hand is played for each player in the game and the person with the least amount of -ve points wins!

Good fun and some good innovations (saboteur, bidding) translates to a tense affair. Much to like.

Az eredeti Wizardhoz hasonlóan itt is az ütéseink számát próbáljuk megtippelni, de emellett az ütés színeit is el kell találnunk. Nincs Z és N, 1-től 15-ig pontozottak a lapok és 5 szín van 4 helyett, az adu pedig fixen a piros. Ezen kívül bárki választhatja a gonosz szerepét, amivel a célja, hogy a többiek büntetőpontokat gyűjtsenek nem megtippelt ütések vitelével. Mindenki mínusz pontokat gyűjt és annyi parti után, ahányan játszanak vége a játéknak, a kevesebb büntetőponttal rendelkező játékos a győztes. Nekem adott olyan élményt, mint a Wizard, szerintem jól kitalálták, a lapok az új kiadásban szebbek, mint a Wizard lapjai. Talán a gonosz szerep fix -4 pontja könnyűvé teszi a választást, ha valaki vezet, illetve a kevés kör nem biztos, hogy kiegyenlíti az erőviszonyokat, de jó játék az extrém Wizard. Tetszett.

[2012-01-22]
Nem emelek a pontszámon, mert a kevés kör miatt nehéz javítani. A Wizard jobb, de nagyon jó az Extreme is.

[2012-01-28]
Drasztikusan kettővel csökkentettem a pontszámon. Több olyan leosztás is előfordulhat ugyanis, amikor már kezdéskor eldől, hogy valaki bármit is csinál mínuszpontokat kap. Ez nonszensz szerintem. Illetve a kevés kör és a mágus könnyű szerepe miatt több játék után úgy érzem nem jól sikerült ez a kártyajáték.

[2014-06-30]
Két és fél év után újrajátszva most jobb élményt adott. Nem volt kiíró eset. A FM választása vezetőként még mindig erős. A szerencse szerepe viszont kevesebb, mint a Wizardban. Legyen most 6-os.

I own the "Wizard Extreme" version. I wanted to like it, but it turned out to be rather bland. The theme is not just paper-thin, but non-existent and just pasted on. This game could just as easily be played with regular playing cards and some tokens. The art, although quite colourful, was not very exciting to look at. Additional confusion was created by some cards being green but having blue numbers and vice versa. The game mechanic makes for some interesting decisions and tension during the game, but I just couldn't overlook the disappointment about the fact that this is just a dressed up card game. Most likely not a bad card game, but if I want a card game, I'd rather break out a pack of regular playing cards.

This game has been released under a number of names, one of which is Wizard Extreme, and it's easy to see why.  Players bid on the suit of their tricks as well as the number.  But the real twist in this Dorra-designed trick-taking game is the saboteur, which allows one player to forego bidding on tricks and spoil the round for everyone else.  It's meaner and more interesting than vanilla Wizard.  I like it a lot.

RATING: 7
[Amigo 'Die Sieben Siegel' 2003 edition] {trick-taking, bidding, sabotaging} A unique trick-taking game with a dedicated saboteur. The saboteur creates much excitement for the game. SS is cheerful and confrontational. It's a good alternate to Oh Hell! - while Oh Hell! encourages internal competition for the highest tricks, SS encourages competition between the saboteur and other players. Besides, a player has to be more accurate in SS because he has to name the exact tricks for each color, rather than the total tricks.

"Red" is always a trump card is a nice rule, where the game is more deterministic, but I love the tension/chaos with no-trump. I am thinking if it's possible to create a house rule for a no-trump round.

[SimplyFun edition] The "Zing" edition looks too abstract.  I prefer "Die Sieben Siegel" edition.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.25
I have the more bright-and-flashy Zing!, and have to say that just looking at pictures on BGG, die Sieben Siegel looks cooler.  But, that aside, this is actually a pretty decent little trick-taking game.  It requires an amazing accuracy in bidding that will take a lot of practice to perfect, I think, but that's not a complaint; I just think I'll have a better feel for the game after a few more plays.  There are some really interesting mechanics at play here that makes it a very fun screwing-everyone-and-defending-yourself trick-taking game.  Plus there's what amounts to an overt Traitor role every round, a single player dedicated to messing everyone else up.  I doubt I'll play it often with four--our group is a dedicated set of Tichu fanatics--but with five I would definitely break this out from time to time.

COLORBLINDNESS NOTE:  The cards are pretty distinguishable, since they have slight 'texture' differences in how the backlighting and swooshes across the card art from color to color.  However, I found that making out what trick markers other players had in front of them, particularly across the table, was sometimes difficult.

Played 3+ times.  This is a very clever trick taking game.  I like it a lot.  You bid for the tricks you're going to win as well as the color you're going to win the tricks in.  Depending on how much you miss by you get negative points.  Trump is always red and if you win a trick with trump you can count it as the suit lead or trump.  The addition of the saboteur makes this game shine.  The only thing I don't like is the leader can take the saboteur to guarantee herself a max of 4 negative points.  This just means that some one else should probably take it first.  2006/06/22

This game is so close to being excellent rather than merely average or slightly above. My biggest quibble is with the saboteur, who is supposed to throw a monkey wrench into everyone else's bidding plans. But, the saboteur's points are based on how many extra tricks other players take. Soooo ... logically the absolute best thing the saboteur can do is avoid taking each and every trick, maximizing the possibility that other players will take extra tricks. How does that sabotage other players' bids and scores??? Other than this glaring inconsistency, this game is pretty solid, especially for fans of Spades.

There is definitely room for clever play in this card game and the saboteur definitely adds a nice twist to the game play as card play will definitely change if the saboteur has been taken. Very interested to play with 4 or 5 players to see how the additional cards and players affect game play. Really solid trick taking game.

Nice and simple trick taking game. No fiddly rules. You have to guess how many tricks of which color you will make. Less bookkeeping than Wizard.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A novel concept (a trick taking game with each player predicting exact amounts of tricks in each colour), but in dire need of rules tweaking.  The Sabotuer, being limited to no worse than a -4 score guaranteed, is almost always a no-brainer.

After the initial 5P game, it is difficult to rate.  Sticheln has went over so well here, but this does seem to be a little bit of a better game.  When playing with inexperienced players, the saboteur is incredibly overbalanced.  However, as players learn how the game works, pulling off the saboteur becomes very dangerous and challenging.  

One observation:  it is very interesting what happens to the group dynamics when the saboteur is selected.  When one player selects the saboteur, it forces the other players to both play for themselves and work together to set the saboteur.  Great little mechanic.

Own the Wizard Extreme version. Great trick-taking game. It may not seem like it from the description, but the game actually has a similar feel to my favorite trick-taking game, Sticheln. You're trying to take tricks of certain colors, avoid tricks of other colors, and taking opportunities to stick your opponents with bad tricks whenever possible. Plus there may be a saboteur who is trying nothing but to stick people with bad tricks.

The game has one small advantage over Sticheln and a number of other trick-takers: it's very easy to explain and understand. Red is always the trump suit, so you don't have to keep up with any kind of changing trump. There are never ties for who wins a trick. The bidding system is easy. It still takes a few games to know how to bid competitively, but at its heart it's a pretty simple trick-taking game with a couple of small twists that make it really stand out.

Die Sieben Siegel is another nice twist on trick-taking games.  Most players are hoping to take exactly the tricks they bid, but one player can play the saboteur and throw a wrench into everyone's plans.  Still haven't quite figured out how (and when) to play the saboteur well, and choosing the appropriate number and type of trick tokens is always a challenge.

Medium-weight trick taking game. Unique in that you must also bid on what color tricks you are going to win, as well as how many. Scales well from 3-5.

Cute bidding and trick-taking game. Nice for supporting multiple players and having the possibility of asymmetric roles. Has been the go-to trick taking game here long enough to wear out several sets.

RATING: 7
A remake of Oh Hell!  It replaces the inability to bid the amount of tricks as possible, with the "chaos maker"(my name not their).  Good time.  It works at a trump trick taking game because the lead is forced to different people constantly because people need to hit an exact prediction instead of trying to run many.  One play of what I hope to be many.  The tokens really let the players know which leads are safe.  Nifty nifty game.  I really fell for this game.... I need to get the others in my gaming group to agree(they don't like trick takers)

I don't think this is an evil game as I have read in many comments and the game description.

Enjoyable trick taking game. Not as tense as Wizard, and there never seems to be much serious screwage...

People who claim that this is absolutely nothing like wizard are probably exaggerating a bit (or part of the trick-taking elite), but expect neither a sequel or an expansion.

A tricky trick-taker. You have to bid on the exact amount of tricks you think you'll take and which suit they are in. That's just a small twist but what makes this game better than average is that one player will always be the saboteur who gets points for ruining it for the others.

One of my game group's favorites, a trick taking card game where you have to bid on specific suits of the tricks you take. Unique, in that the quality of your hand matters not (well, that's not exactly true - some hands are easier to bid than others!), only how accurately you bid. If you think you can take no tricks, then bid zero and max out! Or, take the Saboteur and force others to take tricks they don't want! Everybody likes this one and we play it a lot!

Homemade edition of Die Sieben Siegal, everyone calls it "Die Steven Seagal", so why not let the punishment fit the crime? I laser printed the cards and tokens of my own design. Red-money, Green-guns, Yellow-street drugs, Blue-explosives, Purple-martial arts weapons, Black-Steven Seagal, White-Buddha. The saboteur is a well known profile view of Steven Seagal in a firing stance from one of the movie posters.

I like the way it plays, though scoring seems to be sort of a bummer; the only way to do well is to do less poorly than the other players. While this can be done through skillful play, there's never a feeling of "getting back in the saddle" you get from a well played hand of Wizard. It's evil in a very fun way, but also sort of a downer. Interestingly enough, I'm enjoying plain old Wizard a lot more. Still a good game though!

Pretty solid trick taking game. The bids can be tight, as they are suit specific, and the use of the white wildcard bid chits is a nice twist.  I'm not sold on the Saboteur, but more plays may reveal aspects that my first play may have overlooked.  Definately a game that I enjoyed and may look to add it to my collection.

Rated after 8 games, played with 3, 4 or 5 players. A really nice trick-taking game, I definitely want to play this again. It seems that it is quite hard to make very big point differencies, which makes this a nice game, because the winner is not known until the very end. I have been trying to use the saboteur quite a lot, but with 5 players I have had minimal success. With 3 players, it is clearly a better option.

This is a wonderfully evil variation of Spades.  I'm not usually one for screw-your-neighbor games, but in this case, it's almost always in your best interest to interfere with another players' plans.  One of the people at the table described it as follows: "It's like Spades, only with Satan poured into it."  I think that about says it all.  =)

The one characteristic that makes this trick-taking game unique (Saboteur) is broken. [i]Siegel[/i] is a decent trick-taking game, otherwise.

I could screw up any number of existing games by adding a single rule that was never playtested properly.  But those games - like this one - should never be published.

One of the best trick-tacking games I've ever played. At the beginning of a round players try to guess the tricks they%u2019re going to win on a determinate round. But there is more: a placer can take the role of the saboteur, who adds chaos, bluffing, and insecurity to the game. It's not really a new game, but truly an excellent twist to trick-tacking in general.

Beautiful cards and an easy to pick up trick-taking game.  The bidding mechanic is unusual, as is the role of sabateur.  The sabateur seemed too powerful at 4 points.  5 seems better, at least while we're new to the game.  Less stressful/more fun that most games of its kind.

Having been brought up on trick-taking card games, die Sieben Siegel definitely has an appeal to me and settled comfortably into my ever growing repretoire for this genre.  My only reservation (represented by my slightly above average scoring) for this is the saboteur role.  Mostly because I don't really understand its necessity in the game.  Many people have contended that it's to give people with mediocre cards, ones you don't exactly know how to bid with (like if you have a lot of 7-11's), a chance without taking more than 4 points, but to me that explanation is really lacking.  A saboteur's intention is to screw with others, either by taking away a trick they thought they've won or by ducking out of one that they did not expect to get.  In order to do either of those you need to have good and a wide range of cards (being short suited helps, as well as having long trumps).  So to me in essence a saboteur must always have a decent enough of a hand to be able to affect the outcome of that round.  However, if I have good cards, I should then be able to make my bid which begs the question of why would I risk starting out with negative points by choosing the role?

Anyway, it's going to take a lot more plays for me to try and figure this out.  I imagine my rating would improve if I can be convinced that the saboteur is a crucial part of the gameplay and one that require skill to do well in.

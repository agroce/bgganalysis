This game was designed for larger groups. It's definitely not something that you want to play with people who are offended easily or take things personally. There is a lot of player to player interaction and it hardly ever has a pleasant outcome. With all of that being said, THIS GAME IS MAGNIFICENT! It is easily one of the most fun games I have ever played. The mechanics are easy to learn. (in our first play-through, I read the rules and taught them to a group of 10 without any difficulty) The simplicity makes it fun for everyone and allows for a streamlined experience. I only recommend this game if you have a group large enough to play (6-12).

Highly dependent on your group, I could see it falling extremely flat with those on the introvert side because you have to be active to really even create a game. ONUW is still king, but this has a lot going for it. The wrinkle of not only the highest vote getter dying, but ALSO everyone who didn't vote WITH the majority dying keeps the paranoia level high, and also lets rounds proceed rapidly.

Had a bad experience with this game. I allowed the use of cellphones which turned the game into a game played by people texting each other their plans. This lead those not in on the texting to have a very confusing frustrating time. Ive yet to get it to table again but plan to outlaw this practice and see if it improves the game. I really like the concept.

This game is good, and while the theme is bad, the mechanics are superb. This is the ultimate bluffing party game.

To play properly, you need at least 5 players, and everyone should be checking out everyone else very, very fast. You need to act like you were on crack and paranoid and a bully. You need to see if other players are making a deal or targeting you so you can take them out or defend yourself. You also need to make a deal with other people to take another person out. How you do this is up to you and limited by your creativity.

RATING: 5
For those that are familiar with games like Lifeboats, this is essentially a popularity contest (Players are voting on who they want to eliminate). But by adding an "ambush" mechanic, the game really feels quite different and something similar to the One Night Ultimate Werewolf series. That's because if the targeted player realizes they are being targeted, they can play their ambush card, which allows them to survive and to kill one of the players who targeted them. Thus, it adds an element of intrigue/deduction and creates a situation where everyone is trying to be discreet in manipulating/communicating with other players.

The only strong criticism is with a 3-player scenario with the ambush card. Essentially, it leads to a situation where the only response it to also play an ambush card and essentially null the round (everyone dies). But the designer has acknowledged this issue and has already offered a variant (no ambush cards with 3-players), which works quite well.

Overall, this isn't the type of game that I would want to play frequently. But if you get the right group together, it provides an interesting and fluid experience. Furthermore, the game seems to play much quicker than the 45-60 mins that is suggested on the box.

(6-12 players, 15 minutes) As a group of ruthless armed robbers, it's time to split the loot after the heist, but no one wants to share. So someone's got to die. The only problem is trying to agree on who it is without being able to speak or gesture! If you sense a hit coming you can defend yourself, but be warned; those who don't go along with the majority, or who defend themselves unnecessarily shall also perish!

Had our first bad play of the game; learned it needs to be played with people that know one another. We had two groups that really didn't know the other come together and play with a full 12, and it was just each group voting to kill someone from the other group until they couldn't each round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A nice light filler game to play at the beginning or the end of a gaming session, as it allows you to pick on people but with quick rounds so player elimination is not a huge time sink. Plus it plays with a lot of people well, making this a good party game. The negotiation and shoot 'em up of the main part of the game is great, but I personally am not a huge fan of the prisoner's dilemma game play when you get down to 2 remaining players each round (which determines gold/victory points). Not one to take too seriously, but worth the relatively low cost if you've got big game groups.

RATING: 8
Wow do I love this game. Its been said before, but I really agree that this fills a unique niche in the genre of a-new-twist-on-werewolf games. More data with more groups is required, as ive only tried it with a very outgoing bunch, so YMMV, but wow, such a unique power struggle. I may prefer this over the resistance and spyfall(at least for now) but unfortunately it really does require a higher player count than both of those games. With that only caveat, this is a great place to experiment with how to stab your friends in the back. Cant wait to play this again. And simple rules are a plus if you want the experience of a party-ish game that has real bite.

EDIT: Finding it hard to get to the table because my wife finds it just so mean. I disagreee... but we'll see if I can get any plays with this in the next little while, as I would like to get some more data with it.

Ugh, I hate these kind of social games, where players spend time arguing/bluffing/sending secret signals over what should happen, and then all make a decision trying to outguess what everyone will actually do. It all just seems extremely random, and barely feels like a game to me. I also hate other similar-type games like Werewolf and Secret Hitler, and find them thoroughly boring..

If you like this sort of thing, you'll probably love Dead Last. It's absolutely a game I'd never want to play again though.

RATING: 7
This one is kind of a doozy, actually. I went in expecting something more akin to traditional bluffing, but there is really nothing else like this game. It is all groupthink in a box - and either you're going to love it for that or hate it.

The pacing here is great and there's a lot of laughs and tension. However, this is a game that can be frustrating when people don't play "well" and just base their decisions on random whims. In our very first game, my husband started a campaign against the player in the lead, but one of his co-conspirators betrayed him for no real reason and he wound up dead while the leader ran away with the win. It was shitty, but because there's not much to guide players' actions and it's such an obviously social game it can really be prone to that kind of thing. So you really need the right type of group for this.

Additionally, I actually think this might be better with fewer players rather than more. When we first broke it out, we played three back to back games with 11 players, and at that number you're going to have a LOT of people die every round - which leads to only a small percentage of people at the table ever getting their hands on Loot cards at all. It's pretty easy to feel uninvolved in the game at such a high number. We had 3 players drop out mid-game because they simply felt like they hadn't [i]done[/i] anything yet.

So... honestly this one is sort of a mixed bag for me. I enjoy it but it does feel even more susceptible to bad group dynamics than your average party/bluffing game. Weirdly, this is probably best enjoyed with a serious group.

Just bought this 2 days ago and played it yesterday with some of my youth group (Ages 12+, boys only, 6-8 total players). We had a BLAST! I'm an alpha gamer. If I don't win, something is off. In this game. I didn't win. And it was AMAZING.

Game is easy to explain. Instructions are great.

The game worked best when we stood up away from the table in a circle. Everyone was an equal distance from the people next to them. This made the communicating very fun and challenging. You're not being communicated with? Maybe you should play your ambush card. In this game you have to declare upfront, "Lying is encouraged. Deception is encouraged. Betrayal is necessary." 

One thing we noticed after playing many, many, many games (over 1.5 hours) is that when it gets down to 3 players it's really pointless. So, we made it that if it hit 3 players, each player just gets a gold bar. It still gets down to the final 2 a lot, so that didn't ruin any aspect. Just made it more fun for us. 

Another thing we did, which I like for any game I play, is that we made the objective a # of gold bars NOT the numbers on the gold bars. Otherwise, you have someone who won 3 gold bars that each say 3... and someone else only has 2 gold bars, but his are 5s... well he just won. That's dumb. So just play to a certain number of gold bars. Small change, but effective.

This game is going to be more fun with more players, as games will last longer and more people will be trying to strategize and communicate.

Buy it.

Bit dissappointed that the group collusion and negotiations didn't really seem to happen, we all just sort of sat quietly around the table, played a card and then hoped for the best. 
This game is pure social negotiation and therefore loses quite a lot if the group doesn't really engage. 

Will try again with another group another time, but maybe I am just not a fan of these social type games.

Social collusion is certainly a unique mechanism.  I like that it supports a large number of players, though it seems like it might be best around 8-9.  I typically don't like player elimination, so I'm glad it only lasts a minute or two in this game.  There aren't enough games with an implementation of the prisoner's dilemma, so that's a definite plus in my book!

I finally got to play this and was blown away by how simple it is, and how much fun you get out of trying to come up with ways of communicating who you want to target. As soon as you pick up your cards your playing, when you make eye contact with someone it's like you're waiting for them to communicate, or you are and then you look over to your target and they see you looking at them, and you panic wondering if THEY KNOW that you've targeted them and so it begins.

The game is a hilarious rush from the first to the last, and a great spectator sport while you wait the 3-4 minutes for the round to finish as you watch other people struggle to communicate what's happening.

With quick decision times (they box says 1.5 minutes but you're never reaaaaalllly going to need that much time) every decision feels important and hilarious.

RATING: 7.8
wow! played this several times spread out over several months - what has remained constant has been my amazement at how a variety of groups generates such a quick response to the challenge the game presents. People devise a communication strategy to quickly identify - shift - confirm - second guess - confirm - their selection of the "out" group player. There's often a player who is completely lost - or feigns being lost - and doesn't even know a game is afoot. Adaptations to intense constraints masked by the design as complete openness (you can do whatever you want, they say!) -  yeah, but you have to do the game equivalent of execute a friend. This is a coercion simulation and it triggers something deep - a capacity we have to act under pressure and cooperate. It's a tiring experience that for me goes something like this "wow this is cool that we are communicating! How are we doing this? This is amazing. Ok, now let me focus on not losing -let's settle in to figure out what's going on here..." and as the experience curve goes from that initial rush to the steadier state of "playing" the game...that's when the game starts to diminish. It's hard to sustain that initial energy for long and often time sessions burn out rather quickly. This game stands as a unique experience that drills as deep as i've seen into the phenomenon it's emulating - worth experiencing. Curious if the game could stay as pure as this but somehow sustain the engagement longer with some modifications.

This game is a pretty solid game, but to be fair I feel that it honestly benefits from the group I play with. My regular gaming group has an annoying tendency to gang up on 1 or 2 of the members in every game, and this completely shakes up the dynamics due to the game mechanics. It is refreshing and perfect for my group. That being said, it seems very group dependent. The mechanics aren't remarkable, and the game itself isn't super deep.

My friend winks at me from across the table and flashes a card showing blue, next to me my wife fidgets with a blue plastic mug. I look over to my other friend playing blue; he looks happy and quickly puts a card down... dose he know something I don't?  Can I trust my wife and best friend? Or am I the target of a plot against me! In this game you are part of the collective or you are dead ! What this game does so well is that you stay invested even after your dead. Watching people try to secretly create teams and gang up on people in the open without anyone else knowing. The game plays very quickly from round to round as a round can end very quickly. A fun light party game that will get a big group laughing and joking in no time! It will also highlight who in the group is paranoid. A good ice breaker for new people too.

one of the meanest games ive ever played. It is so quick and dirty. it freely encourages underhanded backstabbery and needs a group that can get in on that.

The game is fine but I have two main complaints about it. When someone is ahead people can just shoot someone and make them play ambush and there is no way to survive after that. My second issue is that I played this game 5 times and never saw a steal steal and I know that seems hard to believe but it just happens. Maybe it's about my group but I have better party games that makes me happier when I play.

I can definitely see the appeal for this game for social gamers, but for me I am not a fan of games of pure social negotiation and bluffing. For those who do like such games, this not only plays a hard to find player count but has multiple levels of double think: whether to trust the agreement of who to target, the ambush cards making people not necessarily wanting to bash the leader because it would be too obvious, and the actual distribution of loot. I also really like the artwork in this game. It might still go too long for people who like this genre though. Overall, this game reminded me actually a lot of a manga called Liar Game (in the only arc I read instead of a majority game it was a minority game and the protagonist negotiated with the other players to get someone on his team to be a winner).

Solid large player count party game.  The weight is low enough that it allows players not heavily into board games to participate as well.  My major issues stem from some lack of clarity in the instruction manual about a variety of situations that might arise.  I know we looked at least three times for some clarifications to our individual situations in the manual that just weren't there.  Nevertheless, it was good enough for me to pick up at full price, considering I needed another large group game for my Wednesday night game nights.

Currently one of my favorite party games.  Quick, exciting, interactive, you laugh a lot, everyone is involved.  Rules can be taught in a minute, couple of rounds and everyone understands the basics, more rounds and strategies start to emerge.  Lots of opportunities to laugh.  Scales well from 6 to 12.  Scales well from young to old, quiet to loud.  Ruthlessness is expected, it's part of the whole atmosphere and the silly fun of playing this game.

Finally...a game that captures reality show-style voting into  a solid game you can play at home.  Also, I'm usually not a fan of games that incorporate the Prisoner's Dilemma element, but the way it's used here is effective especially with the added "Grab One & Go" option.  Word of warning...you have to pick the right group to make sure this play well.  And while players are only out for a round after they're eliminated, if somebody is constantly an early target, that person will have a bit of down time on his/her hands.

I really enjoy this game. It takes the elements of shows like Survivor and Big Brother, and put them in a card game. Your goal is to eliminate players each round, by voting out a player with the majority. If you do not vote with the majority....you are eliminated as well. The final two players pretty much do a "rock, paper, scissors" to see who receives points for the round. First to 24/25 points wins the overall game.

Add two points if your game group is large and willing to make an experience out of playing this game. By experience, I mean "willing to text message, leave the room to collude, or use other sneaky IRL methods to leave people out of negotiations". When all are always seated around the table, the intrigue just isn't there and the game boils down to double-think.

This surprisingly is probably my now least favorite social deduction game that I own.  I really thought it was going to be a ton of fun, but the main issue with this game is that it only seems to work well when playing with people you know really well.  I'm talking about having everyone's phone numbers, and knowing how others think so you can give clues in vague ways, etc.  Outside of that every game turns into the same thing, people giving gestures to others with their eyes, flashing cards, or just tell other people their thoughts.  This gets boring surprisingly quick.

Also to add I would NEVER play this to 25 points now, this should only go up to roughly 15-18 points.  25 points definitely makes the game overstay its welcome
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is a fun social collusion game! It has got elements of Pow Wow/Coyote where you team up on people except in Dead Last you aim to reduce the pool of people in the running to take a prized collection of good ol' gold. 
Now since you have to collude with others to figure who to eliminate, the rules are quite flex here. You can do whatever you want. Eyeball someone, point fingers, signal with cards or pointing on random objects that has the same colour as your target. This might seem unfair but the game has an excellent way for the victim to get back at their bullies in the name of the Ambush! card. This essentially allows them to save their own skin if they get targeted and escape with the head of one of their attackers as a reward.
Great party game with a lot of laughs.

Pros:
1. Light Game - Very easy light game to teach.

Cons:
1. Limited Alliances - As things are done in secret,  you end up working mostly just with your side of the table. This makes it less interesting.
2. Decision Point - The decision point is lame. You vote with your decision usually being with your alliance. 
3. Long - This game takes upwards of 40 minutes to play with the last few minutes taking entirely too long. Having to continually replay rounds at the end of a round is lame. Then having rounds end with no one winning is horrible game design.

Overall: So many better light games out there. Just skip this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
A pinch of Spyfall, a dash of Cash & Guns, and just a touch of One Night Werewolf mixed together into something hilarious.

I expected Dead Last to be just another mediocre light social deduction game, but I've been delightfully surprised.
The tempo of Dead Last beats far, FAR too quickly for lying or bluffing to be much use.  It is a beautiful, comical display to watch players attempting to apply Resistance style calculative methodology only to immediately find themselves dead, having missed or overthought some brief flash of a signal.

This is not my perfect game.  There is not nearly enough room for thought, strategy, or diplomacy to take hold in any meaningful way.  However, a full game round only takes 5 minutes, and watching the psychology of frantic groupthink in action is fascinating.

The forced negotiation can be tricky to navigate. The game doesn't provide a lot of insight into how you can share info or form teams without being totally obvious. I'm not opposed to discovering unique ways to communicate with players, in fact, when it works it's a lot of fun, but most of the time Dead Last feels unfocused or chaotic. Spyfall is a clever game that gives you just enough of a push to inspire creativity. This one will take a bit more work.

This is an extremely fun group/party game. The communication between players to target people is very entertaining. I love to see the reactions when people realize they've been duped!

Fun game. The free-form nature of the "negotiation" really makes this stand out. Usually in these games there is a hard rule that you can say anything but you can never show your cards, but in this game anything goes. Show a card to one person, then show another card to somebody else to try to get them both eliminated. Walk over and whisper to one other player.

In one game a player went to the restroom so the rest of us all agreed to just vote for her to be eliminated that round. We all had a good laugh when the cards were flipped over and every single person had voted for her. That type of thing would normally be bad form, but it's all within the spirit of this game.

My only complaint is that the game is too long. In the future I'll probably lower the amount of points needed to end the game, at least at the higher player counts. Also, the publisher issued an errata that you can't play an ambush card if there are just three people left in a round. This fixes an issue where playing ambush would always be the best option in that situation.

Similar to Mafia de Cuba in that this is a fundamentally flawed (bordering on broken) game that's still kind of a lot of fun.  Best in the specific niche where players are creative and talkative enough to form some interesting shifting coalitions while still not being grizzled veterans that will easily break the game.

Flaws include the late-game prisoner's dilemma having awkward motivations for the fixed score goal, the odd 3-player rock-paper-scissors dance, and the ability to indirectly collude to ensure specific players die no matter what.

In short, I enjoyed my 1 play of this a fair bit, but it'll fall apart in a crowd that's either too serious OR too casual and you're better off playing something like One Night Werewolf or Spyfall.

RATING: 6
A card game in which players try to collect the largest sets in nine "suits".  Each turn you are dealt a hand and pick one suit from it to add to your tableau.  Largest set in each suit grants a special power that allows you to mess with other players or protects from being messed with.  Quick and quite fun, though there is a substantial element of luck of the draw.  Don't believe the box when it claims that Koryo is a two-player game; there's just too little competition for majorities.

Production quality is pretty good and the artwork is quite striking.

Cutthroat tactical card game of shifting majorities and player powers. An interesting idea that doesn't play as smoothly as I would like. Some turns you have really tough decisions, while other turns you aren't given much of a choice based on your card draws. You have to shuffle the discard pile a lot. Ship owner ability seems too overpowered.

RATING: 7
A surprisingly deep game.  I actually really enjoyed it.  It's kind of minimalist in concept (ten characters in 55 cards, and eight rounds to get as many as you can out), and has some good push-your-luck action in it.  Way overpriced at $30, but a good game.

After going through a few reviews, I thought to myself, this is going to be one terrible game, why did you get it! 

However, my first impressions were good. I thought the game was quick and fun with decisions on what is the best for the next step after taking into account what your opponent might do base on the cards that are played on the table already.

Will likely table this more often. It is a shame it is for  a maximum of 4 players only.

Initial Impression: Set in a futuristic steampunk Korea, this cardgame probably has the strangest theme I've ever experienced. Unfortunaely, the theme has no effect on the gameplay, which is at heart a set collection game. There are 2 interesting things that set this game apart. The first is that whoever has the largest of a set is granted a special ability from that set. The second is that as the game goes on, you have less options so each option becomes more tense. I enjoyed this quick playing cardgame and would be interested in seeing how it plays with more than 2 people.

RATING: 7.5
Needs repeated plays to see the strategy behind getting majorities and using them appropriately. The card stock is quite terrible for a game that requires heaps of shuffling (Moonster made the cards slimmer than the 7 Wonders ones, so there are no matching sleeves - boo!).

Koryo was a fun little game. Play out cards in an increasing number each round. Having the majority of the card number played lets you do a specal ability which include things like stealing cards, protecting your own cards, braking ties, etc. We played with 3 and really want to play again with diferent player numbers to see if it plays differently.

Fun, quick card game. My only real complaint (although it is a major one) is that the Ship Builder is REALLY overpowered to the point that it kind of breaks the game...or at least makes it "who can get Ship Builders quickly". Apparently in the newer version of the game it's been fixed.

RATING: 5
Short, simple game where luck of the draw has a huge impact.  You are trying to get majorities, but as the game progresses there is less and less you can do to improve your position because you are drawing fewer cards.  Better with more players because more cards are dealt out for play.  With fewer players you can have the situation where a powerful character like the Spy is held through the whole game by one player because the other Spy card is never dealt out.  

It is fine for what it is (a quick filler) but not a game I would choose to play.

It seems good, I don't know yet what is the luck part.
I love the art.
Update after 9 games (mainly 4 player games):
So far is seems a bit random and chaotic. May be a bit too chaotic for it's own good. There is some king making, and it seems important to play last on the last round of the game...
It plays well, and most people enjoy it, but I'm not sure it will stay once we'll see that more play does really make you a better player.
It's a good thing that 4 player games last about 20 mins.
I need to test it with 2 and 3 players, it might "save" the game for me, as I like my games a bit heavier.

I really enjoy the idea of the whole set collection with special powers for majority holdings. There's a tension with points for end game versus immediate capacities. There's an interesting timing effect as you only need to have majority on your turn in order to perform an effect, which you can predict pretty well.

The problem with the game is, it isn't all that interesting with two, as there's nothing to balance an early lead, and the play two different types of cards clan is overpowered at that point, and getting it in your opening hand is a question of luck, not skill.

While, with more than two players, there is a great likelihood of players being unable to win, but not eliminated from the game, which, when your goal is to win the game, on what basis do you decide what to play when winning is impossible?

The game comes off as very complicated at first and the instructions aren't particularly well-written.  My friend and I ended up looking up a video to explain the gameplay.  But once we understood how it worked, it made a lot of sense.  We still need the instructions for reference on what a lot of the cards do specifically, but the game goes very smoothly now.  We have come to enjoy it and I would recommend trying it, especially if you can find it on sale.

The icons are a little tricky to pick up, but this is an excellent game. Plays quickly and has tough decisions as while you can play a bunch of cards to get a majority you still have to discard at the end of each round, which could hurt your majorities that are for end game scoring.

Wow, a fascinating game!  My few plays have all been two player, and I am quite keen to see how the game plays with three or four.  But the simple rules of (decreasing) numbers of cards you receive each round and the (increasing) limit on how many you can keep produces some thought-provoking choices to make.  

Looking forward to more play with this quick game.

RATING: 6
Pleasantly surprised. When I read the rules, it didn't sound like much, but it clicked better for me in practice than it did in theory. 

This is probably best considered as a "micro" game. One game takes considerably less time than a full game of Love Letter (many rounds), but longer than a game of Coup. One game of Koryo has multiple rounds built in, but they have a nice progression to them, and are super simple, with scoring only happening once at the end. Thus it's a 15-20 minute game where it feels like the game was played once, rather than the same game played 10 times (Love Letter).

Korean design of simultaneous card play with a lot of card interactions. Players collect sets (1-9), with most of each value able to conduct a special ability during the game, and most of each set scores its face value at game end. Players draw a X cards per round and can only keep Y number of cards. Each turn, X decreases by one and Y increases by one, so players develop a tableau in front of them. Turns are fast and game is fairly quick. Steampunk theme is in art on cards only, not really part of the game.

This is an interesting card game from Korea. Take a deck of cards numbered 1-9. Each round you get dealt 9 cards, then 8 then 7 and so on. But each round you can only keep 1 in front of you, then 2, then 3, ie the reciprocal number to the deal. If you have a majority in a particular number in your tableaux it triggers a particular power. The at game end you score points for those numbers you have a majority in. So it is a game where you are constantly fighting for the majorities in order to activate the powers and achieve game-end scoring. For a 25 minute game there is a lot going on here and I'm looking forward to exploring it further.

Koryo kind of feels like a area majority micro-game but it can't really be classified as such because it has about 70 cards or so.  I feel this way because I could explain the game extremely quickly and it probably plays in 15 to 20 minutes.  I think it presents some interesting decisions for the quick time frame.  Each card has a number (1-9) and each unique number has a special ability associated with it.  Each unique numbered card has a number of cards in the deck equal to it's number.  There are also 10 events included in the deck (6 of one type and 4 of another).  The game is played over 8 rounds.  Each round, the round card will tell you how many cards you draw and how many cards in your tableau you must discard down to.  Cards drawn decrease each round and tableau limits increase.  Each round is played like this: (1) draws cards equal to the number on the round card. (2) in turn order, each player plays face-down as many cards of the same type (events or non-events) that they would like. (3) in turn order, each player adds their face-down cards to their tableau and resolves any abilities they would like, in whatever order they choose.  You may only resolve abilities of the 1-9 cards that you have the majority of.  Each event card played is resolved regardless. (4) in turn order, each player discards down to their tableau limit if they exceed the amount.  If you have any events in your tableau, you may not choose to discard these cards.  Then, the 1st player token is passed to the next player.

All cards in players hands and discarded from tableau (due to limits/events) are shuffled back into the deck from round-to-round.  At the end of the 8 rounds there is final scoring.  Any 1-9 cards you have in your tableau you have majority in, provides VP equal to it's number.  Each event provides -1 VP.  Each VP coin you have is worth 1 VP.  The player with the most VP is the winner.  Here are the card powers:

(1) Breaks majority in this players favor only for card powers, [i]not[/i] end of game scoring.  
(2) Steal a VP coin from a player  [i]and[/i] Become immune to the swap event IF you have no 7's in your tableau 
(3) +2 to Tableau Size 
(4) Discard an event from your tableau 
(5) During the play card phase, instead of placing as many cards of 1 type you may instead place exactly two cards of two different types 
(6) Take a VP coin 
(7) Become immune to the character killing event 
(8) Draw an extra card during the draw phase 
(9) No ability (but worth 9 points at the end if you have majority)
-Kill Event: Choose a character of a player not protected by the majority of 7's and kill it.  That's a single character, no all characters of the same number.  There are 6 copies.
-Swap Event: Choose two characters between two different players that are not protected by the 2 and swap those characters. That's a single character, no all characters of the same number.  There are 4 copies.

This is decent and has some interesting decisions despite being so quick.  I also haven't decided whether I like being first or not... if you go first your face-down cards will be in play first which could mean temporary majority in a number.  On the other hand, if you're late in turn order, you're face down cards can't be targeted by events.  Also, reducing your tableau is done in order, so being later in turn order means you can react to what others do.  It's not an amazing game but definitely a fun little filler with a micro-game sort of feel.

My biggest complaint is that there is no text on the cards and the iconography could have been better.

This game, while decent, has been succeeded by Chosŏn which uses very similar mechanisms but with better game play.

One of the games that drew me into the hobby.  So much to a straightforward seeming game.

Print out the player aids from the files section for goodness' sake!  (Actually once you know the cards well it is easy to remember, especially given the icons each card.  But they are pretty much required for learning the game.)

I was willing to play this 2 player but would never reach for it - best at 3, then 4, then 2, for me.  I've been playing some games on BGA lately though and have developed an appreciation for the 2P game (seems impossible to get a realtime game going with more than 2).

Zmiana grafik w polskiej wersji moim zdaniem na plus, ale może dlatego, że lubię bajkowe klimaty. Na razie po rozgrywkach na 2 osoby przyznam, że podoba mi się coraz bardziej. Można mieć wstępnie jakąś strategię, ale wszystko zależy od tego, co zagrają współgracze, ale najpierw od tego, co wylosują na rękę. Ciekawa jest opcja negatywnej interakcji dzięki wydarzeniom, ale te przynoszą atakującemu ujemne punkty, więc niekoniecznie się opłaca. Grając pokojowo, nie do końca wiemy, kto wygra :)

Curious to see how this one develops.  In particular, I'm wondering whether luck-of-the-draw outcomes loom too large over lots of plays.  As it stands now, it's a wonderful short + light game which, due to juicy decisions most every turn, beats others in that category.  Have only played 3P games.

A quick card game of tableau building. Each round, players receive a hand of card with restrictions on how many they can play, and how many they can keep on the table in front of them.

Koryo has simple rules and easy to understand game mechanics. The game can be appealed to boardgamers in many ways. However, this game also shows several weak points. The main problem of the game is hard dependence on card luck. During game, dealing cards is very passive to every players. Therefore, the game provides very little chance of decision making. Especially, at the last two or three rounds, which are the most decisive moments, are destined by card luck. From time to time, players have just nothing to do, but accept their daily card fortune. Koryo is not my cup of tea.

A unique and quick playing card game that offers some interesting choices. The huge drawback to this game is the iconography, which is not sufficient for understanding, and the lack of a player aid. It is a huge oversight to not provide new players with some reference about what each card does. Expecting each player to remember all the different card powers is a flaw that holds Koryo back from an easy first play. A game of this weight and length should have as little of a barrier to entry as possible, and here they failed. That said, the game is very enjoyable once you know what all of the cards do.

Comment stolen from eeville

[q="Eeville"]Koryo kind of feels like a area majority micro-game but it can't really be classified as such because it has about 70 cards or so. I feel this way because I could explain the game extremely quickly and it probably plays in 15 to 20 minutes. I think it presents some interesting decisions for the quick time frame. Each card has a number (1-9) and each unique number has a special ability associated with it. Each unique numbered card has a number of cards in the deck equal to it's number. There are also 10 events included in the deck (6 of one type and 4 of another). The game is played over 8 rounds. Each round, the round card will tell you how many cards you draw and how many cards in your tableau you must discard down to. Cards drawn decrease each round and tableau limits increase. Each round is played like this: (1) draws cards equal to the number on the round card. (2) in turn order, each player plays face-down as many cards of the same type (events or non-events) that they would like. (3) in turn order, each player adds their face-down cards to their tableau and resolves any abilities they would like, in whatever order they choose. You may only resolve abilities of the 1-9 cards that you have the majority of. Each event card played is resolved regardless. (4) in turn order, each player discards down to their tableau limit if they exceed the amount. If you have any events in your tableau, you may not choose to discard these cards. Then, the 1st player token is passed to the next player.

All cards in players hands and discarded from tableau (due to limits/events) are shuffled back into the deck from round-to-round. At the end of the 8 rounds there is final scoring. Any 1-9 cards you have in your tableau you have majority in, provides VP equal to it's number. Each event provides -1 VP. Each VP coin you have is worth 1 VP. The player with the most VP is the winner. Here are the card powers:

(1) Breaks majority in this players favor only for card powers, not end of game scoring.
(2) Steal a VP coin from a player and Become immune to the swap event IF you have no 7's in your tableau
(3) +2 to Tableau Size
(4) Discard an event from your tableau
(5) During the play card phase, instead of placing as many cards of 1 type you may instead place exactly two cards of two different types
(6) Take a VP coin
(7) Become immune to the character killing event
(8) Draw an extra card during the draw phase
(9) No ability (but worth 9 points at the end if you have majority)
-Kill Event: Choose a character of a player not protected by the majority of 7's and kill it. That's a single character, no all characters of the same number. There are 6 copies.
-Swap Event: Choose two characters between two different players that are not protected by the 2 and swap those characters. That's a single character, no all characters of the same number. There are 4 copies.

I consider this to be pretty fun and some interesting decisions despite being so quick. I also haven't decided whether I being first or not... if you go first your face-down cards will be in play first which could mean temporary majority in a number. On the other hand, if you're late in turn order, you're face down cards can't be targeted by events. Also, reducing your tableau is done in order, so being later in turn order means you can react to what others do. It's not an amazing game but definitely a solid filler with a micro-game sort of feel. [\q]


One remark though pricing of this game is high. 70  thin but big cards with beautiful art and 9 carton chits...
I think they can sell a multitude of copies if they lowered it easily as it is a quick an easy to explain game. 
It scratches the same itch Macchiavelli has for me as you have different roles and powers that influence the game.
Yet it plays much quicker. there is no downtime at all.

I recommend this to my local pub who asked me to name a few games people could play there.. I advice sleeving though..

I'm rather intrigued by the mechanisms in this little game. There may be a problem with the 5 card being overpowered in a 2-3 player game, but didn't seem to see it in a 4 player game - control of the 5 moved around enough so no one player had the advantage with it.

Nice little cardgame which brings a bit new ideas as well. You want to get majorities so you can use some special powers, but here is the trick: in every round you can have only certain number of cards in front of you so getting those majorities is a bit tricky. In the end there might come situations where discarding on opponent card bring pretty big swings what comes to final scores, but I don't think that it is that big issue. Would definitely want to play this more, unfortunately it was sold out in Spiel '13 before I get my hands on it.

Apparently GAMES Magazine described this as "The game Love Letter wants to be". I don't know why I told you that because I wish no one had told ME that but now I am sharing the poison with you. You have to tell someone else within 24 hours or YOU WILL DIE. That's nonsense, of course; other than numbered role cards there's nothing Love Lettery going on here. What is going on is a weird, complex game of shifting power and majority. I wasn't expecting too much from it but I have to say, I find it pretty intriguing in a lot of ways.

Maybe the best 'card game filler' from Essen 2013. Short sessions, and although there is luck in drawing the cards, it seems your decisions matter more.

The gamedesign is clever and clean: every round you draw one card less, and are able to keep one card more that you have played. I also like that the number of points for a 'family' is the same as the number of cards in that family.

And the best thing: choices become harder every round. Great filler that plays in little time. Recommended!

Weird little card game, not quite like anything else. It seems to be edging out of print but can be played online at BGA. It's a drafting game where the cards you don't draft are discarded rather than circulated among players; there's a neatly inverse relationship between the number of cards you may keep in your tableau (which starts at 3 and goes to 10) and the number of cards in your hand (which starts at 10 and goes to 3). -- Horrendously overpriced (thanks, Asmodee), and a bit confusing due to a lack of clear player aids (there are a couple of pages in tiny type you can cut out of the rulebook if you like?!?!?) and the totally textless cards, but I liked it enough to pick up a copy anyway.

Video Review: https://youtu.be/tXsq6ojNQWQ

Koryo you intriguing but hard to love beast you. Koryo is a very clever and appealing game of set collection and majority control of suits (called families). There are nine families in the game each with a unique power. They are number 1-9 and there is the same amount of that family in the game as numbered. So 1 1 card, 2 2 cards etc... You only activate the powers on the card if you have the majority of that card in front of you. There is 8 rounds and each round the number of cards you are dealt decreases whereas the number of cards you can keep in your tableau increases, starting with 10 cards dealt and 3 cards kept. Powers let you mess with limits and other players. 

This is a fun quick, tactical game that is almost ruined by an awful rulebook!

RATING: 5
It's one of those games that will probably see a fair bit of play because of its filler qualities, in that reasonable decisions come quick and fast. There's one decision each round - which number in your hand do you think you'll be able to play out so that you'll have a majority in that number, and thereby be able to take advantage of the special power of that number. Do that once for each of 8 rounds, adding to your tableau each time (sometimes having to get rid of previously played cards as the size of your tableau can only increase by 1 each round). My first problem is I felt locked in to whatever my hand provided and the decision was pretty obvious. Second problem, you either get lucky or not on whether someone else goes for what you put out simply because of the draw, and others go uncompeted. Thirdly the combo of some numbers are WAY more powerful than others ... comes back to luck of the draw. I ended up playing it out to see how to played out, but basically it disappointed me from the start and continued throughout. Even for a filler.

A game with nice card artwork. There are action cards and cards numbered 1 to 9. The number also says how many cards of these are in the game.
Each round you get dealt a number of cards. In the early rounds you get dealt more cards than in later rounds.
At your turn you play from your hand one type of card in any quantity you possibly can. If at that moment you have the mayority in any type of card you may perform their special ability. A shame that you possibly have to discard a number of cards and the end of the round. The number you have to discard to gets a little bit higher every round. The action cards have a value of -1 and these cards you cannot discard normally.
At the end you get points as printed on the cards only if you have the mayority.
The game plays great. It is fast. The symbols used on the cards are not too clear but after a few rounds you know.

RATING: 7
Light, amusing area majority game.

I agree with many of the commenters that the luck factor is huge in this game.

For a game this light, it's a bit fiddly. *A lot* of shuffling is required in this game. The cards are shuffled eight times (I think) in a span of about 20 minutes. And players play cards from their hands *once* per round!

As with area majority games, the main source of interaction is determining whether to fight for majority in a particular area (in this case, suit of cards) or move on to another. There's also quite a bit of take-that in this game, too.

Ein sehr schönes Kartenspiel, das aber m.E. nur mit drei oder vier (also nicht mit zwei) Teilnehmern Spaß macht. Der Grundmechanismus - jeder bekommt in jeder Runde weniger Karten, darf aber jede Runde eine Karte mehr in seiner Auslage behalten und muss alle übrigen Karten abwerfen - ist simpel und natürlich zufallsanfällig. Was aber bei der Dauer einer Partie (ca. 20-25 min.) und der durchaus vorhandenen Möglichkeit, auch mit wenigen Karten noch Umschwünge in der Endwertung erzielen zu können, keinen Schaden hat. In jedem Fall empfehlenswert; auch mehrere Partien in Folge machen Spaß.

RATING: 7
Clever game of shifting majorities linked to game effects with power inversely proportional to the reward they bring at game end. As such it's a fast playing filler that offers a little more than most in that category. That said, the last couple of turns can totally turn the game upside down based on what players are dealt, a bit of a shame as it's otherwise entertaining to play.

This game vastly exceeded my low expectations.

It is less random and less spite-based than it looked from reading the rules, and there are some interesting emergent and dynamic competitions between players as the game proceeds.  The powers interact in interesting ways, and the play restriction makes you think tactically about what cards to play.

However, the game seems to be always won by the person who claims high numbers, not cleverly using the special powers.  The attacks can bring down the top player, but usually at the cost of the attacker also losing.

All in all, you make interesting tactical decisions about what cards to play.  However, those decisions are a subtle and interesting tie break mechanic compared to luck of the draw during early rounds.

Played once with 4P. The mechanisms in Koryŏ certainly feel original, with players requiring a majority in a certain character in order to trigger that character's ability.

2015: 8. Have had a few games in person and a few online.  I really like the game, not least because of the fantastic art.  The gameplay is light, plays fast and matches can swing wildly by the luck of the draw.  You have to stay on your toes. It makes things very tactical, and yet the game does force you to cobble together some kind of plan since your options keep shrinking every turn, a wonderful tension.

Elegant design, great art, quick and interesting gameplay.  Thumb's up!

I've only played this with 2 players so far, but I have enjoyed it so far.  It plays fairly quick once you get use to the game.  With 2 players there is a lot of thought in what actions you are going to take.  The only downside is the later rounds where you get fewer cards, the luck of the draw really seems to sway the game.  Maybe it is better with 3 or 4 players.

The only annoyance is that they don't have a reference sheet.  So new players have to constantly look at the rules to see what benefits you get from holding a majority in a family.

1 play, 4er

Interesting micro game that really makes you think, with only a small deck of cards. You play several rounds, each time getting fewer cards in hand. Players simultaneously choose to play 2 cards of different ranks, or multiple cards of the same rank. As you play, you're building up majorities in the different card ranks. Each rank gives a different power, but only to the player with the single majority of those cards in play. There are also special action cards to mess with other people's tableaus. At the end, the player with the majority in each rank (2-9?) scores as many VP; lose VP if you played those special action cards. 

But I don't think it's one I'd return to often: although there's definitely a quick, cool game here, it may be a bit too chaotic for me. And the fact that Mary absolutely hated it makes it even less likely that we'll get a copy! But I'd definitely try it again....

This game plays pretty interestingly.  Each round players draw a certain number of cards and can play any number of cards of one number.  Having the majority of cards of that number gives them a special ability as well as that many points at game end.  Then at the end of the round they can only keep a certain number of these cards.  There are 8 rounds and each round you draw fewer cards but can keep more out at the end of the round.  You're trying to have the most points by game end.

I've never seen a game played this way before and it was pretty neat.  It was also pretty quick making it good filler material.  It didn't quite grab me like some other, even filler, games have but it is definitely worth checking out for the unique game play.

Feels like the creator valued aesthetics over gameplay by making the cards a non-standard size and having card effects not written on the cards but represented by icons and then written in the manual. Also involves a tedious amount of shuffling which isn't helped by the fact that it's difficult to find card sleeves for them (sleeves make things easier to shuffle). Gameplay seems solid but the aforementioned elements detract from it greatly.

[+] easy to teach, fast paced, short game that calls for a rematch, luck of the draw immediately balanced by 'going after the leader effect' ^^
[-] don't care for the art (or theme if any?)

A great card game that is sort of trick taking and sort of set collecting. The theme adds a lot.

A card game from Korea, that focusing in majority and tableau building. I made the print and play version with my custom re-theme.

The premise of the game is neat, and I like the way the game develops through the hand of cards balanced against how many you can keep, and what games stay out of the game due to staying in front of other players.  I'm not sure if the game has enough staying power over repeated plays, but so far, it's intriguing.

The game is short and has some neat decisions to make, but it also has a lot of housekeeping for such a short game.  This game makes Dominion look like a light shuffling games.

Quite nice and quick game about set collection, with special powers that comes with having the relative majority of each type of card. Plays fast but is nonetheless pretty strategic.

Πολυ καλο παιχνιδακι απο Κορεατη αυτη την φορα.Απλο,εξυπνο,γρηγορο και με αρκετη τακτικη.
9 διαφορετικες οικογενιες οπου καθε μια οικογενεια εχει και μια ιδιωτητα.Ομως η ιδιωτητα ενεργοποιητε μονο για οποιον ελενχει την οικογενεια (εχει την πλειοψηφια).
Μεσα σε 8 γυρους το παιχνιδι τελειωνει.
Καθε γυρο επιτρεπετε να κατεβαζουμε οσες καρτες θελουμε (ολοι ταυτοχρονα)αλλα μονο απο την ιδια οικογενεια.
Σε καθε γειρο εχουμε limits για το ποσες καρτες μπορουμε να εχουμε παιγμενες μπροστα μας.
Στο τελος του παιχνιδιου οποιος εχει την επιρροη στις οικογενιες με την μεγαλητερη φημη αθροιστικα ειναι ο νικητης.

One of those nice rare good surprises from card games. I liked it the way i liked Biblios and The Boss and a few others.
Koryo has a simple mechanics  but it's filled with interesting decisions, interactions, strategies.
Very good indeed and i'll play it again very happily

Koryo is card game in which you try to build up majorities in differtent categories. It mixes familiar and new mechanics to create tension and 'good frustration'. 
Cards in your hand don't carry over to your next turn, so every turn presents a new set of options. At first, you can select from a big hand, but you can only have a few cards in play. Later on, the competition for the majorities becomes fierce, but you get only a few cards to choose from. 
It took us a few hands to get used to the flow of play, and we had to look up the abilities once or twice. The cards are very pretty, but the icons aren't very self-explanatory. But I enjoy this game more with every subsequent play.

Velmi povedená karetka kde se soupeři bojujete o nadvládu nad rodinami v steampunkovém prostředí. Jedna výtka - někdy je vítěz jasný od prvopočátku a jenom se snažíte snížit skóre.

One of those rare games that is very easy to learn, and still a ton of fun to play. I'm usually not that fond of card games, but this really works.

This is an example of a box that is exactly the size it needs to be. The insert divides it into two compartments for the cards and the 9 tokens, and the box isn't deeper than it needs to be. Could it be smaller? Sure, it could be in a bag, like Love Letter, because the rule book isn't necessary after the second (or first) game.

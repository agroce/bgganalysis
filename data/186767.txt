When I got this I thought it would be more like Once Upon a Time or something with story-telling elements as part of the gameplay. Unfortunately, the gameplay is a purely abstract game where you lay different number/tiles down on the board and try to get the most points (similar colored tiles grouped) but following the strict rule placement.  

Was fun to play a few times, but afterwards, it isn't too much of a game.

In Shahrazad -pronounced "Sha-hara-zod", tiles are drawn and played touching, in columns left or right but shifted halfway up or down, to create a linking path or "story". The goal of the game is to work cooperatively to range the tiles in numeric order from left to right.  Points are lost for out of order tiles and extra points are achieved with adjacent color tiles.

Actually quite a calming solo experience. The components (tiles) are beautifully illustrated and very high quality, thick and chunky. 

I keep the tiles on my desk at work for when I need a quick break from staring at my computer screen.

Beautiful components, but mechanically I'm not sure how long it will keep me engaged. Played with eldest, he was curious but more about the lovely artwork, I didn't get the feeling the play was particularly interesting for him. I expect a few more goes and it will be sold or traded.

Keltis the solitaire game. Graphics are great and tiles are great plays quickly there is a bit of AP that can go on. Of course luck is going to play a big part. A lil hinckey on the rule set. What to remove and not. had to watch videos over and over. Plays ok. for $10 a keeper.

Guilty pleasure - so beautiful! Fantasy hand management and patternbuilding game (puzzly) According to trusted source it also plays very well.

Love the ilustrations, the gameplay is fun, but the only weakness of the game is that once you know the best order, you'll rarely lose.

Puzzley solo game in a similar spirit to Onirim. You can play this with two and it does work fine at that player count, but it's similar in satisfaction to the solo game. The decision process and strategy here is kind of unique and it's a fun play. It can feel arbitrary at times with luck of the draw figuring into outcome, but there's also a nagging suspicion that some of that can be mitigated with skilled play.

Initial impressions are that this is fine game. I think it will struggle to get played for me though when competing with Space Hulk: Death Angel, Friday, and One Deck Dungeon in the solo small box field.

Interesting solitaire tile laying game, where the decisions where to lay hinge on experience with the game and understanding the card distribution. It is likely solvable, but nevertheless lovely for what it is. One that I will for sure play from time to time, due to the its simplicity. It might be even better two player. A very welcome addition from Osprey.

More fool me! I played one round and thought it was going too easy. Despite heavy shuffling the cards seemed to come out in the right order and play easily. And then I started turning cards down and realised I made a dumb mistake. I played one card on the far left, meaning I lost access to the cards at the bottom of the second column, no way for the story path to get there. And that one low card I played on the right lost me another card, which in turn lost the low card too! Only got 11 points for the round.

This is a very nice solitaire. Apart from the very attractive card art, it actually is much harder to work all the aspects, build paths, build groups, keep cards alive. I'm definitely playing this more, it works for me.

Also, the simple scoring cards is a brilliant piece of design work. A remarkable clever design for an age old problem.

Love the art and cards. Game seems very simple but more plays will show how high my rating will go. Definitely a 7 for me - nice quick solo puzzle - but may go higher.

Szerintem kimondottan különleges játék, és nagyon jó a kétfős koop módja. Nehéz, sőt nagyon nehéz, de közben meg úgy érzem, hogy tanulható sok dolog, így talán idővel könnyebb lehet. Szép, minőségi kivitelezés, egyszerű, gyorsan tanulható szabályok... A szóló mód is jó, bár csak ritkán pasziánszozom.

Gorgeous artwork on really nice, big tiles. Great idea. I'm just not the target audience since I'm not into solo gaming. I recommend it if you do enjoy solo or 2-player co-op games.

Fun and unexpectedly challenging solo game of "storytelling", though it's really more of a numbers exercise. You must try to place tiles in coloured groups (the biggest group scores) but numerically they must ascend left to right - which, despite being able to replace tiles, can be a tricky task.

Can hardly be described as a game. It's an exercise in colour matching matching and little else. Somehow worse than Kingdomino

RATING: 7
Very quirky and unique game. I think I need to spend more time with this one, as it treads that line between almost not being a game, and one that has some real subtle depth. I really dig the Tarot theme, especially since I've been playing Persona 5 lately, but the way the game plays reminds me a lot of Hanabi and The Game. Shahrazad is a game of placing tiles in a certain way in order to score points. The rules aren't that great at conveying this, however, so expect your first game to be a learning one. This is certainly an abstract game, but one that I think could be fun to play to pass the time. I'm just not sure why this game is only for 1 or 2 players. I don't see why you couldn't play this with more, but maybe I'm missing something. Either way, if you like games with a kind of Zen feel that aren't going to be too taxing on your brain, this is a pretty decent solo game. It's completely abstract though, so just be aware of that going in.

It's just a puzzle, and about as basic as they come. However, it's downright beautiful. Even though I generally don't like anime-style art the muted color palette and storybook illustrations work well on the thick linen-finished tiles. My only complaint is that they're too glossy and can be hard to see in certain light. You could probably make your own copy of this incredibly easily but with the game only costing about $10 if you like the art you should go for it. Just know that it feels about as substantial as a quick cell phone game if you think about it too hard. If you just enjoy it for the puzzle it is you'll get your money's worth.

Solitaire-style game where you attempt to maximize your score by arranging cards from lowest to highest.  The game is easy to learn, but the optimal strategies are not easily apparent... which is more of a feature than a flaw.

Simple tile placing game, which you are trying to place the tiles in such a way that you can build a path of ascending numbers in order to avoid losing titles. Then at the end of both rounds, you score the largest areas of colors. It's fine, mainly a child/solo game. Two player is possible, but  doesn't really change the game.  Beautiful artwork.

While very simple, it does take a little to get used to. Quite a nice quick relaxing game, after finishing one game I pretty much always go for a second. A good one before bed when you don't really care for the score.

Shahrazad is one of those small abstract games that I absolutely adore. The rules are simple, you feel like you’re getting better the more games you play, the games are quick, and it comes in a small box. It also certainly doesn’t hurt that the game is gorgeous.

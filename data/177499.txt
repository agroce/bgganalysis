Fun and fast 1v1, but the rules and fun fall apart if you try to play the tag team version.

Great game, but it needs expansions. More Wrestlers, more match types and more wrestling moves. 

The start was great, but as it seems, the game is dead. A shame to waste so much potential.

Gale Force 9 rocks my world. I haven't been a Pro Wrestling fan for many years, but as soon as I heard they were doing a board game my interest was picqued, simply because they have succeeded thus far in translating every one of their TV licenses into a fun time (especially Spartacus, but I also really like Firefly, Homeland and Sons of Anarchy). They've come up with a fun, fluid system here where you are basically strategizing sequences of Rock/Paper/Scissors like maneuvers to try and outguess and defeat your opponent. I love the card depletion and pinning rules. Box includes rules for all manner of teams, ongoing Events, and other variables. 

The only thing I could complain about would be that I've only got 6 Wrestlers here, which doesn't seem like a whole lot, so I hope potential expansions will focus on expanding this roster with even some classic names. What I'm saying is I want to play Vader.

Played last night with 4 friends and we had a blast! Easy enough to learn, but there is definitely strategy involved. The game is crying for user created content (there is already some) as the game will not unfortunately be getting anymore expansions. If you like wrestling in the slightest, I can honestly say the is the best board game option out there!

RATING: 6
It's a 1v1 game first and foremost. Which is problematic because I already have many games in that format.

After some thinking I'm not so sure if I like the programming mechanic(and that is basically the game!). Felt more gimmicky than anything else. Recently I've heard of a variant that simply removes programming and it sounds like it would improve the game a lot. Remains to be seen.

This game would be excellent if it didnt had 2 shitty wrestlers, 1 that doesnt do anything and 1 that is boring. Had they made a better choice of wrestlers i would have loved it.

Seriously, when you choose roman reigns, langston and BIG SHOW over seth rollins, Dean Ambrose and Cesaro you are doing things wrong

Deck depletion game where hand / deck management is very important. Get out of the ring once in a while (or tag out in a tag team match) to restore some cards.

Really liked the Paper, Rock, Scissors mechanism that's much better than it sounds.  Does a great job capturing its theme in a playable yet engaging way.  Just enough detail.

The actual gameplay couldn't possibly much simpler. Rock paper scissors. But somehow the designers managed to tease that into a surprisingly fun game that simulates the back and forth of a wrestling match pretty well. I'm really eager to see what expansions can do with this game. Even if the theme puts you off you should give this try.

The info in the manual is a little mixed.

No really more than 2 players because with the rules in the rulebook only 2 players really active at the same time others are only for support and active player choose who moves and when.

Great fun with R-P-S. Add in the chance for random card draws as tie breakers (a la "War") as well as tailored character decks that mimick WWE heroes & villains, and you are set for a quick set of rounds center stage. Having an affinity for wrestling goes a long way to amping up the fun, but this is a game anyone can happily play.

RATING: 6
Not a theme that I'm super fond of, but this game design is one of the most successful marriages of mechanics to theme that I've ever experienced. It's got solid rules for reversals, rope jumps, bouncing off the ropes, throwing wrestlers out of the ring, tag-teaming, pinning, kicking out, body-slamming, and it all combines in such a way that you feel like your watching the real thing in action. Fans of WWE should really be able to eat this game up.

RATING: 9
The sleeper hit of the year for me, possibly my game of the year, and certainly the most refreshing pure Ameritrash release in the last few years. The perfect beer and pretzels game. 

This game is a prime example of the whole adding up to a lot more than the sum of its parts. At first glance, the game features six not-particularly exciting wrestlers featured in a game that is essentially Rock Paper Scissors (Slam!) and War. And that's all true. But the simplicity belies the game's brilliance, and its thematic integrity. And there are little touches that make the game flow like a real wrestling match: the limited (and dwindling) supply of defense/kick out cards, the elegance of the count out mechanism, the effective differentiation of wrestlers through unique decks without a ton of extra rules overhead, the thrill of pulling victory from near defeat through a thinned deck that is limited in some ways but reliably effective in others. In many ways, it's an experience game, but it is a mistake to discount the strategy in it. I love this game. 

The game's not perfect just yet. I found the game is most fun in a tag team format, despite the massive downtime,  but the current game is lacking a lot of the things that make actual tag team matches so compelling: partner interference, distracted refs, etc. This is one of the few games that would benefit from a ton of expansions, both beefing up the tag team mechanics and adding a ton of classic and (be still my heart!) maybe even NXT wrestlers.

RATING: 8
I am apparently terrible at this game, but it doesn't stop it being tremendous fun.  It is simple, polished and the mechanics fit the theme extremely well.  It also captures that feel of trading blows and strategic play well.  Really, really good and another hit for Gale Force 9.

I would be ok with the Paper/Rock/Scissor system that this game uses but it is way too punishing. The loser gets nothing and that makes the game too random. They should have given a buff to winner but still allow the loser to do something.

The tactical moving around the field was interesting but the card play killed this game because it's so swingy.

The characters have different card sets but their stat makeup is almost all the same overall, just different in specific stats.

A relatively easy dueling game but with maybe too much luck and a theme I don't care about at all. I think in the final analysis, for this to be worthwhile it would have to MAKE me care about wrestling. Maybe an unfairly high bar. It got as far as making me think "Slams are awesome! I bet I want to slam people as much as possible if I ever have to wrestle!" but the rest of the moves and stats were more like abstract Rock-Paper-Scissors noise.

FUCK, I LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!!! 

Edit: Put it on the table with the right mix of people at the right time, and it's the most dramatic, fun-filled mini-skirmish you'll find. But if the energy's low, or the players don't totally mesh, it falls flatter than a missed body slam off the top rope.

I love this game. Why do I love this game? Really, I am genuinely asking. I haven't watched wrestling since Andre the Giant was in his heyday. I get beat pretty much every time. It can't just be luck or I should win 50% of the time. I cant figure it out.

Would have been a great game had GF9 put out all the Legends and other wrestlers they spoke about at Gen Con 2015. Less than a year later GF9 said it is no longer doing anything else with this title.

As is it is a very good system and I hope someone else picks it up and does what GF9 talked about and hyped up at Gen Con 2015.

Driven by a rock paper scissors mechanic, but there is also a spacial element with the board aka the ring.  Different characters have different decks and I could really see this shining with expansions.  Gale Force Nine continues to put out solid gamer games built around IPs which are traditionally used to push garbage games at wal-mart and toy 'r' us.

This feels a lot like 1st and Goal, where you're trying to outsmart your opponents with card plays, except in this one when you win you actually pretty much win: there's no dice aspect to screw you over. There's a crazy amount of depth and strategy for such a simple looking card game: reversals, slams, when to play blocks, what cards to Give Up and when to decide between hand and deck Give Ups, when to actually go outside the ring, how/when to manoeuvre around the ring, and, *most importantly*, what order to play cards and what cards to leave in your hand. 

This game does such a great job balancing the line between greed and safety, and being too on one side could backfire, but being too much of both could just lose you three straight encounters and haemorrhage cards. It's comparable to Cosmic Encounter in that way: the order of cards and what cards you do use is so well designed and such a thought-provoking decision process that you start to actually care about the strategy involved in this game (and recognise the amount actually in this game).

The theme could probably throw a bunch of people off, but I think if you're big into strategy, card games, and victory by outsmarting, you'd almost be foolish not to give this game a try. As per usual, there's luck involved a bit, but if games like Cosmic Encounter and Agricola can get a pass for their luck aspects, which is similar in scale to the amount of luck in this game, then this game should be treated the same and scored based on gameplay mechanics, which it is definitely great at.

There are some negatives, like a rulebook lacking in clarity in some areas, but they get outweighed by positives of the same type, like the rulebook having a great breakdown of a round to guide first time players through how the game works. I predict the more I play this (and the less I fumble through crucial rules), the higher this score will get. Along with Camel Up, this is a very pleasant surprise of a game. Very enjoyable.

This game is kind of random and garbage and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a great board game. I gave it an 8, though, because WOW, this game is some of the most fun two wrestling fans can have. The pins are scary when you don't know if you can kick out. Manouvering away from your opponent at the last second before they go for their finisher is a delight. Getting the hot tag in a tag team match is incredible. The huge impact from a tense chain-wrestling sequence ends in a sudden Attitude Adjustment from Cena is as absurdly exciting as Orton hitting the RKO literally outta nowhere and draining your deck of every opportunity to kick out. If you LOVE wrestling and have a friend who does too, this game is wonderful, despite hugely lacking in roster size.

You would think this would be a complete and total licensed garbage of a game but I was shocked that this is a really good game. The rules are really easy to learn, miniatures are good quality and the game play is smooth. The only reason this is not a 9 out of 10 is because of the lack of expansions this game craves. Way to go GF9 for another great game.

I have almost no connection to professional wrestling beyond cultural osmosis, but this is a really fun game. It allows for some fun double-guessing, and the ability to execute card icons in any order makes for some really fun and creative combos. In its current form it's just a little basic. I'd like to see some more wrestlers, as well as some ways to involve multiple players beyond waiting around in a tag team match (though those are pretty fun). But for now it's still a really fun game, and surprisingly one of the better games of 2015.

*edit* This promising game eventually languished, which is too bad. It really needed some more content out of the box, and it needed better ways to handle more than two players. I liked it well enough, but it played out quickly.

Very unique game and conglomeration of mechanics.  If you're going to make a tactical wrestling game, this is the best it's going to get.  I'd love to try a three or four-player variant before making a final decision on this.  In the two-player game, it was fast and fun, but I'm not sure there's much replay value here.

Got this as BGG Con 2015 give away game and played an intro game taught by the vendor. I wasn't that impressed by the intro game but it did seem to have some interesting variations you can play so I will try it again and may alter my rating. The gameplay seems pretty basic with randomness and a fairly boring rock paper scissors mechanic at the core though.

When I saw this I was quite excited about getting it for my 12 year old son who is really into WWE; especially when I saw the rating here on BGG.
It isn't too bad a game at all, especially if you like the theme. I always feel there is some strategy lurking underneath but sadly I think it is mostly random luck but none the less, it is an intriguing use of a rock/paper/scissors system and works well for it's purpose.
EDIT: There is a lot of random luck involved but I have found there to be more strategy than initially thought. Especially when playing the tag-team event. I now feel that this is where it really shines. But also in the fact that when your opponent gives up cards, you can study them and the stat card to work out what cards the opponent may have. The game often feels very thematic too. Just wish for more wrestlers/expansions. Rating increased from 6.8 to 7.4

Great wrestling gameplay, and I'm a connoisseur of the genre. Sadly I have moved away from watching wrestling, and my enjoyment was lessened by the fact that I don't recognize the Superstars in the game (well, some, obviously). It would be a blast to get some friends together, grab some favorite drinks, and play this all damn night.

Too bad that GF9 didn't open with a set of classic WWE Superstars. I think a best of the 80s, or 90s set would've sold much better than what this base game offers.

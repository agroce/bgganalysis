Well it's good but I do wish they had went a different route when the "upgraded" the 4th edition. I used to play this almost religiously but time has mellowed my enthusiasm. Some badly need rules tidying up has taken place but some unneccesary changes have been made as well. Not as good as it's predecessor only becuase it takes about 50% longer to play.

Avalon Hill's Rise & Decline of the Third Reich (why didn't they just use "Rise & Fall," even it would have borrowed from Sheir) was my favourite wargame in university, especially with three players.  

I find it interesting how this game is criticised for the abstract nature of economic aspect, or for it being past its prime as a game design.  There's truth in both points, but then again, in my opinion Europe Engulfed is but a streamlined and improved--some would say vastly improved--design that owes more to "Rise & Decline of the Third Reich" than to any block game.  If one looks at the bottom line, what aspect of a wargame is not abstracted to one degree or another, and is EE's Wartime Economic Resource Points all that different from TR's Basic Resource Points?  When reading EE's rules, I kept thinking, "just call the bloody things BRP's and get over it!  Now, we have to have WERP's just to be different?"  

Fine, let ATR be well past its prime, but those who praise games like EE to the hilt should remember what came before.

A very nice game, but a little limited by modern standards.  It is fun, and well made, but some of the mechanics are complex given the involvement of the game.  It can be played a lot faster than World in Flames, but isn't as good from the standpoint of detail, realism, or player choice.

One of my oldest favs, likely played this more than any other wargame (if you include the previous incarnation known as just Third Reich). I prefer this to the original, but fate made me miss out on the release of Rising Sun and thus I never went further than A3R.

RATING: 4
Never quite got this game. Very little relation to the historical event. A horrendous economic system that bears no relation to any reality. Air, naval, and strategic warfare systems are horrid. Diplomatic/Political "system" is a joke. Retains "classic" 3R's odd feel of a tactical game played on a strategic map. Third Reich was good for the '70s, but extremely dated in the '00s, and A3R changes this not at all. I see no reason to play this game at all. EuroFront is my WWII strategic game of choice, and while it's longer, at least there is a game in there. I am mystified as to why GMT would commit time & money to publishing the A World At War combined A3R/RS game.

For this sort of thing, Europe Engulfed is where it's at these days.

RATING: N/A
We played this a lot in the '90s (along with ETO). The political rules give this game a nice possibility for minor ahistorical twists.

RATING: 6
A great competitive game if you have average or better luck.  Very frustrating if you have poor luck - hours of planning can be undone by a single die roll.  A great game for competitive analysis, but lousy for solitaire, rather like chess.

Basically a dead game since A World at War was printed, which made people either embrace even more rules and complexity (and a never finished system) or else flee to other, easier to learn games.

A "fork" (as open source developers would say) of this game is The War: Europe 1939-1945, made by someone who thought A World At War went off in the wrong direction from A3R.

Most of the changes in Advanced Third Reich are for the better and I would be inclined to play this game rather than the older version.  Players of the older AH version would be able to convert very rapidly since most of the core rules remain unchanged.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

Avalon Hill. Another solid game and the follow up game to the 1981 Rise and Decline of the Third Reich.  This game gives players more options and chrome than its predecessor.

RATING: 10
One of AH’s best board wargames. A monster wargame suitable for grognard gamers.  Newcomers to this hobby should stick away from this game. It has a thick and dense rulebook. Nearly every hex you use/enter on the map has specific rules. This is not a typical wargame battle; we are talking about a World War with all its aspects. Players before acquiring this game should have two things: a) ample space to deploy the map, counters, player aids and b) lots of time to finish a campaign; we are talking about weeks/month(s). Although game play is an endeavor to undertake, results are highly historical and realistic. Veteran wargamers will surely get a satisfaction out of it. 

Players are put in the seat of a major power of the era. They are faced with all tasks, challenges and dilemmas that a World War can contain: from allotment of basic industrial resources, political decisions of allying or conquering to military riddles of achieving your goals with what you just have in your hands. Plenty of variations and very many ‘what-if’ to explore. The game gives you the flexibility of achieving more than the historical counterparts but also triggers skepticism of whether it is better for one to ally himself with minor countries than conquering them.

Regarding the military aspect of the game anything is possible from beach-head invasions, partisans and air assaults to submarine warfare and fleet action. Blitzkrieg tactics are well adopted in the rules and almost present to each major battle reaching their peak in the invasion of the Soviet Union. 

Owners of AH’s companion board game 'Empire of the Rising Sun' will notice that research into technology can add more flavor to military actions, to political decisions and even end the campaign with an atomic explosion in a European city. The rest is left to you to find out.

A monster game that I love and have a lot of respect for, in part because this and Third Reich were some of my earliest wargame experiences. The design is solid and not as complex as one might think upon a first glance at the rules. UPDATE: Still a great game, but Europe Engulfed does pretty much the same thing, only better.  I still respect ATR for doing it first. :-)

I bought A3R after inspecting the back of the box and seeing there a green Irish Partisan counter sporting a certain three-letter acronym... but whatever about that, as a revision of an old favourite, "Advanced Third Reich" (A3R) naturally invites comparison with its progenitor, "Rise and Decline of the Third Reich" (3R).  

To start on a positive note: the best new thing here is the diplomacy rules.  These form a complete, coherent sub-system within the larger game, and allow the players to explore the many possibilities that existed in the political arena in which the military affairs of the second world war in Europe were enacted.  This neatly disposes of one of the most telling criticisms of the old game, that it tended, given experienced players, to run in the same old grooves time after time.  Now, an IRA uprising in Ireland, or the emergence of Ukraine as a Germany Minor Ally, to mention but two of the possibilities (there are several dozen countries accounted for by the system), can set an apparently-clear situation in renewed turmoil.

But, the bad changes outweigh the good.  Particularly bad are the absurd oil rules -- losing Ploesti is disastrous, but Leuna isn't even on the map? "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"... And if one is going to deal with the German natural resources problem, then one is better doing it completely, or not at all.  So, add in rules for loss of Turkish chrome, Swedish high-grade iron ore... hmm, getting a bit over-complicated, no?  Also particularly egregious is the addition of overruns.  Overruns are great in an operational game, with game time measured in weeks: they have no place in a game where each turn is three months.  The root problem with both of these is that they are not at the same level of abstraction as the core game.  

One of the most justified criticisms of the old 3R was the number of fiddly little "special cases".  Many of these were rightly subsumed in the A3R diplomacy system, which I have already singled out for praise; only to be replaced by a myriad of others, including the silly oil rule mentioned above.  Again, the essence of the problem here is the failure to remain at the level of abstraction of the game as a whole.

The old, mounted 3R map was far superior to the larger unmounted A3R version, even though those small hexes made counter stacks a litte fiddly at times.  Britain in particular can get  very  crowded... but hey! that's one more reason for to undertake Seeloewe!

In summary: the (re)designers gave in to the temptation to add too many bells and whistles, ruining the purity of the old design without adding much to game play.  It's a shame, because there certainly is plenty of room for improvement in the old 3R.

The so called "improvements" to "Rise and Decline" make this game virtually incomprehensible (and unplayable) at times. The chess-like elegance of "Rise and Decline" makes way to an ultra-complicated array of counters, options and fiddly naval rules. Has been surpassed by most recent attempts to portray the whole WWII.

When you have a classic game like Avalon Hill's "Third Reich" and decide to expand and upgrade it, you had better get it right. TAHGC did just that with this game, though I'll admit that its add-on/companion, Empire of the Rising Sun, made this game truly complete, adding research rules and making the wargame global as the conflict it resimulates.

This is a great multi-player game (4).  The research and diplomacy rules make 3R complete.  Played a 4p game last spring.  Played as the Russians.  Allies crushed Germany in '43.

Pretty much the ultimate evolution of hex & counter wargaming for me ... I knew I'd reached a watershed when I took nearly an hour to work out a plan that ensured the fall of Paris (and of France) one turn ahead of historical results, putting together a critical combination of variant chits and bridgehead exploitation. And at that point I also knew that I'd never play this game again. It is just too long and too demanding for me to consider these days. But there was a time when I thought nothing better.

This last edition of TR is great. The new naval air rules are perfect, and all the other tweeks are exactly what the doc ordered. The new diplomacy rules and variants are excellent (although I think the allied 19 assassinate Hitler one is too much). Contrary to many, I think that Russia has it easier than in old TR4, If they can get some steady BRP from the Yanks in 42-43 then they should win that war.

I might be in the minority here, but I actually prefer this game to World in Flames when combined with The Rising Sun.  The game system is polished and relatively easy to learn... over the course of one or two plays and, unlike the newer "John Prados' Third Reich" keeps chrome to a minimum (if that's possible for an Avalon Hill game of this scope).

And don't worry about the rule book... even with its 48 page length, it can be easily learned in a couple of plays.  Many of the rules are exceptions which rarely occur in play.

Much improved graphics and components than the original.  System is also streamlined to assist players during play.  A real update to a game, not just repackaging.  Complexity is an issue here but not uncontrollable. The desginer of the edition also produced "World at War" based on this game and expanded it, a truly modern monster classic.

RATING: 9
As far as I am concerned one of the best wargames of the European, Eastern and African fronts ever made. Though being one of the best ever made, I think the African part of the game is the worst bit and could do with improvement. The Eastern front theatre is probably one of the best parts: as soon as winter 1941 comes, 9 out of 10 times the German advance comes to a grinding halt. After that the losses for the Germans start to pile up. But it is possible to win the war for Germany and it's Italian ally. Succes in Africa is needed for a complete victory to keep American and English forces busy.
Note: Players not too familiar with mobile warfare(Blitzkrieg as the Allies called it) might want to read Achtung Panzer by Heinz Guderian(First Published in 1937) to create favourable break throughs.

This was my first hex and counter war game. I loved it back when I got it and loved it each time I played. Today whenever someone complains about a game's rule book, I say, "yea, well look at this one!" and then proceed to pull out A3R. I don't play much now, because it is just too darn long. Maybe I'll do a scenario again soon.

As far as WWII grand strategy goes, this game is only surpassed by its 'open-source' successor A World at War (now available from GMT).  A3R covers all aspects of the war, dealing with each aspect amply.  But, I'd definitely suggest A World At War over this ancestor game.

I've a cousin that loved earlier versions of this game and really knew its ins and outs.  So when the updated version came out, I bought it with the goal of learning a classic with some "improvements" and new strategies.  Sadly, it didn't live up to expectations.  The diplomacy system sounds great, but really seems to break the game by giving additional early power to the Axis and adding some really heavy swings based on luck, for example.

I like the strategic and tactical options, and enjoyed playing the game regardless.  With some fixes, I'm sure that I'd enjoy the game more, but it's so large and deep that it can be hard to get the game out of the box when gaming day rolls around.

Despite tons and tons (and TONS!) of rules, this game is just too simplistic for me by todays standards. I prefer simple but realistic rules rather than a million detailed ones which lead me to resolve battles on a 'classic' CRT! WTF?! Played this with people that said they knew the rules (but probably didn't). After a few solo attempts I let this fall by the wayside. Still got it but man, I'll probably never play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A terrific and detailed account of WWII. The diplomacy system guarantees that the game will never play the same twice and makes for a great "alternate universe" version of the war each time. Requires patience? Difficult rules? You bet, but it's well worth the effort. Only some actual mistakes in the rules (and no errata!) keep this from a "10" rating.

RATING: 8
A classic revisited. Although sold as a new game it is just a revision about original "Rise & Decline of the Third Reich". But this revision is really deep. Economic system, ground combat, movement, scenarios, and other basic mechanics are strictly the same. Diplomatic, strategic warfare, air and naval combat, are the great differences from the previous "R&D". In my opinion, air and naval combat are better with the new rules, much clear and with a lot of examples. Diplomatic rules are augmented but the difficult is not worth what players get in return. Too much mini-countries to care about. 
Mapboard is not mounted (one step back in terms of quality) but hexes are bigger what represent an improvement. The question is, is it a worth to buy this one? Well, if you are a die-hard wargamer and a collector too, my answer is YES, and probably you will buy "Empire of The Rising Sun" as well. If you are an average gamer, do not waste your money and what is the worst, your time. There are much better strategic wargames out there to play. Titles with up to date concepts and modern approaches. Anyway I love this one for what it represent for wargaming history. This is why I rank it so high.

Oh, how I once loved this game! I've played at least a half-dozen 3-player, full campaigns of this and loved every minute of it. But what did I know back then?

Can't really see that much of an improvement over the original.

I'd rate it lower because of the amount of effort required to even get started on it, but that wouldn't be fair coming from an addicted ASL player. Complexity probably overstates the "realism" as with many other ultra-complex games, but this really is the definitive statement on strategic-level WWII games.

Took the great game of 3R and made it even better.  The diplomacy aspect of the game makes for an interesting and creative game.

Too much complex, practically impossible to play. Maybe the rule book can be easily managed by a computer so I can imagine this would be a very beautiful PC game.

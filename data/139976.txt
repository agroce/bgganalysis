Currently my favorite game.  I love the assymetry, the strategy, the theme, and of course the miniatures.  I am looking forward to getting the expansion factions because I want to play some new factions, but close to a perfect game for me.

An excellently balanced asymmetric worker-placement/area-control game.

With a lot of games, learning all the mechanics and interactions and strategies is most of the appeal, with fun plateauing after a half-dozen plays. Experienced players will only play a set of optimal strategies, and the game calcifies.

Cthulhu Wars, however, gets more fun the more you play it, and the more experienced the people you're playing with. After more than thirty sessions, I'm still encountering new strategies and interactions!

The expansions take all that, and ratchet it up by an order of magnitude. Between the High Priests, new factions, new maps, and independent elements, I can't see this game ever outstaying its welcome.

FAVOURITE GAME - A great area control, action point allowance game. You control one of four available Great Ones from the H.P. Lovecraft fantasy universe, and of course their respective army of monsters. You are trying to open as much gates as possible as their number will score precious doom (aka. victory) points at the end o each turn. This game is focused on combat and it is an imperative to grab as many gates from your opponents as possible. Driving the strategy are a player's wish to expand his power base, and his need to accomplish six tasks to acquire his faction's spell books. Each faction has a unique set of monsters, spell books, and special abilities, and has different requirements to acquire its spell books. It is a great game with huge miniatures, athough their quality is not the best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Wow, what a piece of art here. The components are huge and very beautiful, the artwork and quality of components are excelent, the game itself is very interesting and reminds me of Chaos in the Old World, but with only 2 different ways of ending the game and winning is only possible through victory points, what makes Chaos in the Old World a little better game design, in the other hands, Cthulhu Wars has different appeals and plays a little bit faster.

One of my favorite games - I give very few 10s. I am waiting for Onslaught 2 to add the expansions, though frankly, just the core set has plenty of replayability. It's an exquisite blend of theme and strategy, with elegant balancing mechanics for an asymetric game in which at some point, everyone will be convinced that one faction or another is overpowered or underpowered.

RATING: 9
The game it draws the most immediate comparison to is blood rage, but without a draft (the asymmetry instead coming from the faction themselves) and with WAY more incredible minis. The spellbook mechanic is fun and in general ensures that there will be lots of interaction, and the game as a whole plays surprisingly quick. The price point might be hard to stomach for some, but there is a great game in here, not just eye candy
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So here we are again, competing for turf on a crowded world map.  The factions are asymmetric, as in Chaos in the Old World. They gather special abilities as the game progresses, as in Blood Rage.  Cthulhu Wars achieves this with fewer rules (hurrah!), but less strategic depth (I suspect). A second game, this time with Yellow Sign, a faction that runs on absolute strategic tramlines, confirmed my opinion of this one.

The miniatures in this game are so big that I hesitate to call them that;  they are the best I have seen.  Everything else is well produced.  The artwork is evocatively dark.

Interesting gameplay, I enjoyed the game but nothing more. I suppose I'm a bit biased because I don't get all this Cthulhu fad. Anyway it's fun and I won one time at a ludicrous 44 pts with the Yellow Sign - the only one not HPL Greater One - considering my bias about HPL it's kinda funny that I won with it. Gamewise beware of yellow player, he has a sneaky road to victory easy to pass under radar and eventually win the game. 

All in all a bit repetitive and dull, waiting for expansion deliver this summer to try it again ;)

My FLGS had a copy sitting around in December, and I couldn't resist buying it for myself as a Christmas present.  

Chaotic but a blast to play.  There is more strategy here than meets the eye, but one must understand each of  the factions fairly well to play well consistently. Very much like Chaos in the Old World in that regard.

Each of the Great Old Ones play very differently, which is a big part of the charm.

Full disclosure.I played 1 8-player game . The core 4 factions  feel more balanced and playtested than the remaining 4,with tcho-tcho being the  clunkiest faction.  It was a fun game with the occasional appearance of balance issues. Even with a board specific to it, I'd never play 8 players. I can see the heavy influence of chaos in the old world in this game. From this one game, I'd still play chaos instead.

Incredible game! Since my first play through about 9 months ago I've thought about nothing else and I compare EVERY area control asymmetric game to this. Even with 4 players it only takes about an hour+ if everyone knows the game. Add in all the expansions and extras and that time ramps up. This is a crown jewel in quality and production value. The only thing that stops it from getting a 10 is the fact the game costs a small fortune.

Una vez que los jugadores dominan las reglas se convierte en un gran juego de control de territorios con algo de batallas. Las "miniaturas" son impresionantes. Las diferentes habilidades están bien balanceadas y no se siente que una tenga la ventaja. Aún cuando ya no tienes las de ganar es entretenido arruinar la estrategia de los demás.

Update: After a dozen plays I have raised this to a "10" rating. While some games are richer, they also last four times as long and demands at least that much of an investment. Pound for pound, this game offers so much of what those epic games offer in a fraction of the time; it almost feels like you're cheating in getting that kind of experience from such a smooth, short game session. This is without any of the multitude of expansions which offer a crazy amount of variability. Add in the terrific community led by Sandy and Arthur and the scope of the Mythos this game covers and there is no argument left for me make for myself for this not being a "10."

1st play was quite mediocre. We were 5 players and the game took 5 hours and the mood around the table got a bit disagreeable at times because of rule confusions and the fighting on the board. I played as Cthulhu and made a huge blunder right from the start of me not going on the offensive. Midway through the game I was practically out of the game. At the end of the game I controlled one measly region.
Rating: 4

2nd play was much more enjoyable at 3 players, even though there were hardly any fighting (maybe 2?), the tension was at least there. Sleepers vs Wind Walkers vs Crawling Chaos. I played Sleepers and won quite fast by rushing ahead on the Doom track. Much of it was caused by the table diplomacy and that Wind Walkers didn't feel like capturing one of my lonely Cultists (in the pacific). Wind Walkers were on his way to the North Pole to summon his 2nd Great One. So, later in the round (I was successfully stalling with Lethargy) I built a Gate in the pacific for my cultist which overall gave me a net-gain of 6 extra power over the two last rounds which gave me enough power to rush the Ritual twice. 
Rating: 4->5.5. 

I'm still iffy about how the game handles the Spellbook and unlock-requirements for each Faction. The game is really slowed down if you have to consider what every faction needs to unlock a new spellbook and all the spellbooks they have. Instead of being clever about it the game just overloads you with small stuff you have to keep track on. And since everything is open information, why not check?

I much prefer Kemet's style of ramping up ones power level. Sure, there's many tiles to keep check on, but you always know which tiles your enemies can access and which tile combos they are likely going for. And once again, the geometry in Kemet is equally worth for everyone; you know why someone wants to control a temple. In Cthulhu Wars, the value of geometry is solely dependent on the adjacency factor and the rulesets for each faction (e.g. the poles for Wind Walkers). More minuscule stuff to keep check on.

Played today with my game group and I loved it.  My group mostly gave it a 6.5 but I really enjoyed it. After one play they felt that their factions were under powered and other peoples factions were overpowered.  I did not win but I realize that the faction are balanced when you play to the faction's strengths. The problem is people dismiss a game as broken when things do not go their way.

Not a bad game, but it offers less interesting choices compared to a game like CitOW, and it didn't engage me enough to try to sort through all the different rule breakers and faction abilities of opponents.

I've played this game more times than I can count. This game is never NOT dramatic. It always provides good stories and yelling and mirth. It's cutthroat, but the throat cutting happens so often that no one ever feels like they're out of the game. The theme can be rough around the edges, but the whole game is designed in such a way that it feels more like playing with harmless toys than corrupting and annihilating the populations of the Earth. It's just fun. Play it with all types of people. No regrets.

Admittedly I haven't played a lot of dudes on a map games, but this is my favorite. It's easy to teach, you get a sense of strategies you want to try out pretty quickly, and games don't take very long either. I like it better than Chaos In The Old World because there are fewer fiddly rules to remember and no swingy turns due to randomly drawn cards.

That being said, it does require players to team up and counteract certain strategies when they get out of hand. So it requires players to realize what the strategies of opposing factions are and what they can do about them. New players might be frustrated when one faction or another takes an overwhelming lead. This is just another way of saying that the game rewards skillful, repeated play.

This is a great game. It is a "Great" game, too - huge and demanding of table space (as well as human sacrifice, blood and sanity). Faced with the prospect of a sprawling monster game full of game monsters, I did what any sane investigator would do - built my own. Of course, this carries risks... dark risks. The sound of scrabbling from the back of the house is, even now, calling me towards it. I resist, but I feel it eating into my very core, pulling me into the endless vortex of game after game. I have scribbled some hasty notes on the construction of the final gates, but as I watch, the ink flows into tendrils of scarlet ribbon, rising from the page in dancing webs of intricate patterns. They form new words, words that were not meant for human tongue, written in symbols no eyes were meant to see, save the unseeing eyes of a gibbering Idiot God. The letters race towards me, burning into my mind and onto my retinas - I stagger, thrown back by their force and power... "You owe Sandy Petersen, big time...". What can I do? What was that? You heard it? In the corner, where the shadows draw tight... where there sits an unknowable knot of creeping nameless horror....

Note: I have NOT played this game, and I likely won't ever. 

First off, it's an eyesore with the overly large, overproduced miniatures. Those things are ridiculous. It's the same reason I will never go the The Heart Attack Grill to indulge in their burgers. I'm a fan of "less is more", and this defies that in almost every regard. 

Second, I've overheard folks playing this game, and it's jarring to hear them saying "Niggeroth" or whatever the name is (I don't care if it's spelled different)--one of the monsters/factions in the game. Normally, I can distance myself from a designer's/author's political views, but in this case, it comes out in the game itself. 

Perhaps the Cthuhlu theme and names are due of an updating to make them more modern and apolitical.

RATING: 6.5
With Michael Barnes naming this his Game of the Year for 2015, my expectations were high. It looks great on the table, but each asymmetrical faction feels very scripted as to how it plays out. For example, the Yellow Sign allows you to gain extra Power through moving the King in Yellow and Desecrating lands, but this just means your initial strategy essentially must be to do this, or else you fall behind the other players, who are all using their singular special ability to gain extra Power, etc. And too few options to score VPs means the endgame feels equally railroaded.  Disappointed. (March 2016)

I assumed this game's popularity was solely due to the miniatures, but was mistaken. It's a much more solid design than I was expecting. However, while the base rules are actually quite simple, learning even your own faction's abilities and how to best use them can be tough. And figuring out the abilities of the opposing factions can make for a really steep learning curve. I'd like to get this but the $200 price tag just seems crazy for any game, no matter how good.

I was a Kickstarter backer for this game, and I have played it with different groups of friends about a dozen times now.

This is an ingeniously-designed area control game, with mechanics that perfectly fit its Lovecraftian theme.  Each player controls a group of cultists, who vie to destroy the world.  To accomplish this task, players compete by constructing extra-dimensional gates, which they use to gather power, summon monsters and, eventually, summon their Great Old One.  

The source material is intricately researched, and thoroughly incorporated into the gameplay.  Different factions have different abilities, which are lovingly drawn from the short stories of Lovecraft, Chambers, and other authors of cosmic horror.  When you play as the Great Cthulhu faction, you have a strong connection to the ocean; your cultists can transform into monstrous Deep Ones; and you can drive other cultists mad by sending them dreams, which cause them to convert to Cthulhu worship.  When you play as the Black Goat faction, you can spawn huge numbers of monsters at once (as befits a fertility cult), and you can accomplish special feats through sacrificing your own cultists.  And so on.  

The game play is sufficiently complex, and the available strategies are sufficiently numerous, to guarantee that no two games will play out the same way.  The rules, though intricate, are nonetheless accessible to beginners and experienced gamers alike.

To top it all off, the *colossal* playing pieces are beautifully detailed, which makes gameplay all the more fun.  It feels like a momentous event when Cthulhu (who is larger than a 12oz soda can) gets placed on the board for the first time.

If you enjoy Lovecraft and board games, you should own this.

the Old Ones (makes one feel a little younger, doncha thunk??) -- this rather HEAVY game (literally .. get in shape by pulling it from the shelf ..) .. plays rather smoothly and differently every time, and time is needed if one is ever to master all the factions -- great care & craftsmanship has gone into the making of all the models, but expense was spared with some flimsy cardboard tracks and game boards (sorry to say) and these would have a tendency to become beaten up over time -- each and every faction, though, if played to its strengths, is able to, not only put up the good fight, but can win (despite the perceived strength of Mr C hisself) -- there is a balance here with each faction's special power ensuring a more level playing field than what meets the eye -- unlike other games of power and battle .. 'subtlety' .. surprisingly plays an under the radar part in the outcome, as the overall winner can be a deft, well played, diplomatic "how's your father" mouse squeak, rather than an elephant "damn you" foot stomp -- always interesting, and not always is the most aggressive player the winner , this game calls for some shrewd thinking, timely dipping into the 'doom bag', and oftentimes, can see the low flying dove soar over the high skying hawk -- nice to see a very perceived 'aggressive' game, not rule out victory for 'under the radar' skill

This game is beautiful and plays very well. The rules are fairly simple and pretty easy to pickup for newcomers. The spellbook system is fantastic and makes playing each faction a unique experience. The combat system is good but not great. Sometimes combat feels underwhelming, but any changes would add unneeded complexity. Even when losing, the game feels balanced and always enjoyable from beginning to end. This game is best played with 4 or more players (expansions are required to play with 5-7 players). Expect to add an hour to the expected playtime for newcomers, or when playing with 6-7 players. Did I mention how stunning the figures are? The board looks very impressive when multiple Great Old Ones are on the field. People who have never seen the game will always come up to ask what it is, they truly did a great job with the figures. 

This is a must have for Cthulhu fans, the price is steep but worth it. I love Arkham Horror, but it's satisfying to be able to play as something beyond an Investigator. When people ask me what the game is like I tell them it's like Risk, but on some serious steroids.

The expansions are pretty cool adding new mechanics and more stunning figures, but they are expensive. If you are going to buy any of them, buy the playable factions. Each faction brings a new uniqueness and I thoroughly enjoy all 3. Whether using them to allow for 5-7 player games, or changing up the original roster, they are a great addition to an already great lineup. The other expansions I would only recommend if you have a gaming group that will play the game often. At $15-$60 a pop, they add some fun new gameplay elements, but I've always been satisfied with the base game. 

*I own all of the expansions from the original Kickstarter bundle. Sadly I missed the second Kickstarter so I do not have the Tcho-Tcho expansion.

This game blew my mind. I bought it for the miniatures when I got a chance to have it in sale. After opening the box, I just snuggled with the miniatures for an hour. And man, was I affraid it wouldn't play well. But when I finally got it on the table (after 5 long days of waiting), it was amazing. People got really engaged (for example made a lot of sounds while moving). 
If I could I would play this game every day, deffinitely my top 1. I love Chaos in the Old World, and untill I played Cthulhu Wars, I didn't realized how luck-based it is. CW removes a lot of this luck - there are no cards. It is much more strategic. If only there were no dice...
I love all the options, I love how each faction is so unique and yet so well ballanced with the others. I love how many strategies exist for each faction. I cannot wait for the expansions!

This is one of those games where you need to understand everybody else's special powers in addition to your own in order to avoid getting blind-sided.  Fortunately there are only six per player.  It's not really a dudes on a map game; it's really area control with a bit of dice tossing in the combat resolution.  And of course the components are literally works of art.

Out of six games played, I've seen blue win four times.  Two elder signs for paining an Old One really adds up.

Brilliant. I need a few more plays, but this is EPIC dudes on a board trashing each other. Everything is done so well. straightforward rules with deep game-play and asymmetric powers. 

bad point 1: EXPENSIVE.
bad point 2: too trashy for my euro friends. (Meaning I can't pull this game out every single time someone wants to game. :P)

I am not sure how I feel about the action phase version of the game end. I want more of a climax instead of "oh look. I just broke the world with my hidden points of random values I accumulated. Neenerneenerneener" I suspect a stronger focus on the doom phase will counterbalance this.

Beautiful in its own way, but wow is this game overproduced.  The game play is solid, and is elegant for this type of game.  It also has asymmetric player powers and great theme, which I think add considerably to the game.  There are a couple knocks on this game for me.  1. The astronomical size/price.  While I can appreciate the sheer geekiness of the game, making it oversized and full of plastic brings in a number of practical issues. 2. The Eldrich tokens are lame.  You fight for points (gates), only to have the game determined by who gets the best token draws.  You're probably gonna draw about 6 of these during the game, with values of 1,2, or 3 VP.  If you're unlucky, you're at a huge disadvantage, as the only way to win with bad draws is with a large number of public points --ain't gonna happen.  Players make the game, and if the rest of the board gangs up on you, you won't have much, if any gates to score.  If you're lucky with token draws, your chances go up massively, as having a couple of hidden bonus points is an enormous edge in this type of game.  The finish also feels anti-climatic, as you can't really know when someone has achieved the rather arbitrary victory point condition.  Despite those problems, much of what this game does, it does extremely well.  I expect for fans of games with high direct interaction, this game could become legendary.

A note on the production.  This one definitely goes to 11 --it's insanely overproduced if you don't mind the pun (sort of).  Despite the thick cardboard, oversized board, and huge plastic minis, there are some questionable production choices.  For example the tall tiny markers for power points which aren't hard to knock over, and are easily slid off their space. Functionally, this game isn't especially well produced.  It's all in the eye candy and large size.  And on that front, it delivers.

It's like Chaos in the Old World, but with more chaos and it's not as good.  Wow does that make CitOW not sound like it lives up to its name.

From a gameplay standpoint, it's ok.  Similar to CitOW and City of Remnants in that you play as 1 of 4 factions with different abilities who all have bad intentions and wish to win the game on your own.  Each faction has to use their unique abilities the best they can on whom they choose (a gang up on the leader solution, if you will).  But the lack of card play that CitOW brings makes it less strategic in its options.

That said, the figures look really cool, and the world looks really messed up when enough of them are on the table.

Love this game! Well worth the price! It feels amazing laying the smack down with huge beautifully ugly pieces. There are no strategy cards like other great board games, but the acquisition and use of spellbooks as well as great ones special abilities more than make up for it. Figure placement is very important in order to gain victory. The only problem I really had was I feel the rules could've been better organized

Complex: easy rules but lot of things to understand
Weight: medium
Players: 4 or 5
Length: around 2 hours
Mechanics: area control, dice rolling...
Decisions: a lot, the main one is the table talk ;)
Opinion: first of all, this is not usual kind of games, but I have enjoyed this one a lot.
About the game, really liked it, you have your own faction with your special troops and have to fulfill several things to achieve points. I love asymmetrical games, so this part was good (well, the rest were also good). During the game each of the factions have to do different things and their objectives interfere between them, otherwise...
About the theme, I'm not into Lovecraft and Cthulhu, but I don't mind playing this theme. Indeed, mid game I was talking and naming my troops by their appropriate names, so the game is immersive, no matter if you are into this theme or not.
Although this is a game I know I won't have in my shelves, wouldn't say no to play it if I have the chance

I love war games, and I love Cthuhlu, but I only liked this Cthulhu war game. There is much to like -- a fairly clean system, big crazy-ass miniatures, and a game system that ticks along thanks to minimal hidden information. There is a bit of a learning curve, mostly owing to understanding how the spell books fit together, but it is a game you can comfortably learn as you go. But there are drawbacks, too ... those big minis can make it hard to see what is exactly where, and Lovecraft monsters are probably better imagined than seen. And while I enjoyed the combat aspects of the game, I found myself missing the more granular elements common in other Cthulhu games -- the named heroes and crazed cultists, the bits of lore, the loopy plans and desperate last-stands are too small to register in a game this high-level. So my criticisms are down to taste more than substance. I'd play again (but probably won't ask for it).

Not that great for what it requires.  I think it's better than Risk, but really the only thing really going for this game is the look.  It looks super awesome!  However, the way that the game plays...just flat.  Nothing new or interesting, with small buckets of dice, huge areas with too many connections, and the need for control in a game that it's too hard to do.  The spell book is a cool idea but I disliked the implementation.  I'm just not visual enough to allow that to drive my experience.

Great game.  Players do need to know up front that it is not a combat heavy game, or they might think they are going to play Mythos Axis and Allies, leading to potential disappointment if their opponents wisely flee an overwhelming force attacking them.
Definitely like the doom track progression.  Some might think it goes too fast, but I like it.  If everyone is playing it safe and not roughing each other up, the game still progresses to conclusion and does not stagnate into a quagmire.
Miniatures fantastic, board and play excellent as well.

Not counting the first game when we did not get all the winning conditions right (Humanity technically won), the faction win rate for games I played in has been:

Ancients - 0/0 = 0% (not released yet)
Black Goat - 0/11 = 0%
Crawling Chaos - 6/10 = 60%
Great Cthulhu - 2/9 = 22%
Opener of the Way - 0/3 = 0%
Sleeper - 0/5 = 0%
Tcho-Tcho's - 1/2 = 50%
Windwalker - 2/6 = 33%
Yellow Sign - 2/7 = 29%

Decent game, but definitely a triumph of form over functionality, with huge miniatures that easily overcrowd regions of the map. Even the cardboard portals are ridiculously large for no apparent reason. Its most interesting gameplay feature is the almost complete assymmetry of the various factions. But there are also some weird design choices, like the use of random amounts of victory points drawn from a bag.

This has no right to be this good. Fast-moving and fun, and improves on its obvious inspiration Chaos in the Old World by being more fluid and open.
[EDIT] Add the extra factions into the mix, and the rating probably gets upped by a point. Granted, at that point you turn an expensive proposition into an insane investment, but I think I failed my sanity check a while ago.

Skipped the first Kickstarter, as I thought something with miniatures that huge and cool-looking could not be much of a game--and who needs another Lovecraft-based game anyway?  I ended up buying it from a vendor in the BGG Marketplace at a good price--then drank the Kool Aid and got hooked!  Has become my favorite game, and I am anxiously awaiting a number of expansions from the second Kickstarter.  For non-cultists, this is a chess-like competitive strategy game, but one where every faction has completely different abilities and paths to victory. Oh, and the miniatures are freaking awesome too...

RATING: 3
Rating of a 5 after a single play through. This game is clearly overproduced, and I always wonder how much of the budget is taken away from other elements of the game, like play testing. It feels like sloppy and unbalanced design, and there is a minimum of interesting choices to make on any given turn.


Would be willing to try 2 or 3 more games before I am done with this game, but the level of love shown to the game's components sadly can't make up for a very basic gaming experience. 


Update: Played this some more, and dropping it to a 3. I feel that at its core, this game's mechanics are undeniably outdated and clunky, and the experience felt underwhelming, especially for the play time invested in a session. I don't see myself exploring this title any further.

Very interesting game, and hard to categorise.  First of all the miniatures and the overall production values are fantastic.  Initially the game play seems to be a standard dudes on a map combat game but actually it seems much more complex than that.  Each faction has things they need to do to win and this is different for each one.  A player can take a risky move to achieve some goal early in the game to get a leg up instead of waiting until they can achieve it safely later.  Making a direct all out attack on someone may actually help them and you should have taken a more subtle action to choke off what they actually need instead.

RATING: 10
The hype?  She is real.  Cthulhu Wars is outstanding!  The asymmetrical and unique factions have their perks and ulterior motives, but what really makes this game stand out is how easy and fluid the gameplay feels, without sacrificing (no pun intended) dense and thematic strategery.  My wife (who despises board games, mind you) and mother-in-law sat down for our first session, understood the objectives after two rounds and they both really enjoyed it!  The plastic…c’mon, need I say anything more complimentary that hasn’t already been addressed?  After a few more rounds with my brother, this cemented the status of my favorite game in my collection.

The game isn’t perfect.  If all six spellbooks haven’t been obtained, battling seems like a ‘cat and mouse’ game.  The box, as big as it is, doesn’t seem to quite fit all the plastic goodness, at least in a way that seems obvious. I have to put away the pieces into the GOO plastic holder upside down in order for them to fit underneath. I’d also prefer with the upped production that the faction sheets and tracks would come with thicker card stock.  Oh and price tag, but that’s TBE.  None of these minor annoyances detract from the overall game.

UPDATE: Pandemic Legacy has dethroned the Great Old One as my top pick but this is still one of my favorites! Also many of my nitpicks above have been answered with OS2 KS updates. Much thanks to Sandy and company.

Outstanding production, of course. I am a bit biased here since I feel like the publication of this game is the end of a long journey for me of playing Call of Cthulhu for years and then having Sandy Peterson also shift into board games as I have. The sculpts are amazing and authoritative given Sandy's involvement.

The game? It is an area control game with HUGELY asymmetrical sides. It takes a few plays as a faction to get your head around how to approach it. The faction notes in the rulebook are helpful, at least.  The game is dynamic and does not allow for turtling. You need to have an aggressive plan for every turn or you will fall behind. It is interesting that factions can co-exist without fighting. When fighting does occur, it is more of a disruption or setback than a devastation. Its purpose is to dislodge people, push them around the board, and slow them down. I was afraid it would be too wargame-like for my fiance to like it, but it really wasn't.

There is a barrier to learning this game for folks not accustomed to Mythos terminology or asymmetrical powers. It can be overwhelming. Also, a newbie at the table will have a very rough first go playing with veterans. A larger amount of hand-holding and patience is required to not alienate the "outsider". In my experience, patience in this regard will pay off. It is a far better game than I expected to get from an old RPG guy!

What would I score this without the history and the crazy sculpts? Honestly, I'd give it a 7. The game is fun, but it isn't without issues. I do think too many of the points are tied up in secret tile draws of 1, 2, or 3 points. Given the wide point discrepancy possible in the "hidden" point track, it can be a bummer to draw more and still lose by getting lousy numbers. Superior play can be punished, which is a shame. If this bothers you, just remove the 3's to reduce the impact of luck, but it will probably make your plays a bit longer. Best to just enjoy the ride.

Admittedly, I play it terribly, but it's often felt as though the winner were decided in turn 2 and that there's a potentially severe and accelerating negative spiral for a power that gets behind.

RATING: 7
I was immediately addicted after one play (9), but a second one exposed some flaws (8). Things started getting repetitive after just three plays (7)! I felt the game desperately required the of expansion neutral recruits, and without them it was getting dull quickly (6). Errata fixes didn't seem to help with balance, and in my next play I felt like I was plunged into never-ending drudgery (5).

Then, I changed things up. On my sixth play I used the the 5-player board. Some territories being more than two moves away from each other balanced Blue adequately to make it more of a challenge, which also resulted in the other colors using more of their spellbooks since they weren't constantly chasing blue down (6). The increased reliance on a variety of spells carried over to the next game, which was by far the most cutthroat and close one I've played so far (7). Games accelerated from that point, but the forced "play this way or else" asymmetry really dulled things - especially in everyone having to constantly chase Yellow in order not to lose the game. 

If it wasn't for impending expansion content to take Yellow out of the mix, this would be stuck as a 5-6 for me. However, the brilliance of the mechanics allows me to forgive the transgression and leave it at a 7.

The bottom line for me is that every mechanic in this game is a fun one, but it repeats itself very quickly with four factions and a single slightly-modular board. Any minor expansion would make it feel a lot more interesting and durable to me.

PRO

Pretty much every single thing I love in a game:
- Easy to play, hard to master
- Area control
- Variable turn order
- Asymmetry
- Buying / Bidding / Bluffing
- Tech tree / leveling
- Multiple win conditions and/or victory paths
- High quality, diverse miniatures
- Combat with only moderate negative consequences
- Minimized luck

NEUTRAL

- It feels like the box is overly large and overly heavy due to the massive hard plastic shell that holds the Great Old Ones. It feels over-engineered, or at least a bit space-wasting. Plus, it's hard to puzzle back together.

- Aside from miniatures, what's in the box felt underwhelming, since this is not really a cards/components game. The depth of gameplay somewhat alleviates that, but it's hampered by other cheap components.

- The recommended 5P East & 3P West board set-up isn't as fun as the reverse. 5P East gives too big a boost to Cthulhu due to the double-isolation of Australia as two territories. The 5P West gives each Western faction a chance to move, but limits Cthulhu's opportunities. Play a 4-player game with the full 5P configuration is also fun.

- I don't get why people print self-cover glossy manuals. They're harder to read and get marked up quicker. Give me a nice matte sheet and a heavier cover!

- Despite all the Pros, the asymmetrical play begs for neutral monsters, which aren't yet available. This should have shipped with at least one!


CON

- The unfortunate truth of asymmetrical games is that they wind up being a lot more prescriptive than games with more symmetry. That is because each player's strengths work well against some foes and not others. This is as much true for board games as it is for video games (CCGs tend to mitigate this by watering down asymmetry over time). The result is that the game starts to feel very LOCKED IN, and that's the case here. Fans dispute that it's not that one color is overpowered, it's that another color is not playing optimally. That sucks. You could argue that Chess has a number of locked in opening plays too, but there are dozens of permutations and that's coming from a place of utter symmetry.

- To that point, there are just certain ways you have to play the four-player, original factions version of this game due to the spellbook conditions (which are, effectively, win conditions). Yellow and Red can not be allowed movement. Blue must have access to gates restricted. Only Green gets the chance to make its own fate. Some might call this balance, but without other factions to choose from it feels like the game dictating your actions.

- Blue's Harbinger can lead to seemingly unlimited turns where he wipes the entire board while other players sit at zero.

- Yellow is helpless once the board is filled with Gates due to their inability to summon King in Yellow in a gated territory. I had to house-rule this into being summonable on an abandoned gate to give them any chance.

- Doom track and player boards are a lightweight cardstock - barely more than just paper! I was afraid to damage them on my first play and hyper careful, yet they still got marked up by the time I played a second time.

- Some poor graphic design choices as it relates to text.

- As much as I love the size of the miniatures, there are points you just cannot fit what you need onto a territory and it's annoying. The board should be a bit bigger.

- The box approaches impossible to re-pack - once everything is popped out of punch-sheets and unsettled it's hard to make it all fit again! The plastic shell that holds the GOOs should have slots built in for some of the cardboard components.

(For the record, here's the best way to pack the box using only existing components plus three plastic zip bags and two sheets of small bubble wrap cut to slightly less than the surface of the box.

- Place all the GOOs in their plastic tray; add King in Yellow in with Hastur. Place a sheet of small bubble wrap above them. Add one of the punch boards for stability. Stack the game boards on one side. On the other, stack various sheets and tracks, instruction book, and spell cards in a plastic zip bag atop the tray. (You might also add a plastic zip of Tokens or signs.)

- Fit the box top over this assemblage. With one hand beneath to press the plastic tray into the box, flip it over.

- On the bottom side, fit the rest of the components. I suggest bagging all Acolytes together, all other green figures together, and then all remaining figures in the large bag. Nest them into the spaces in the tray - the large bag on the side with more space, the acolytes in the widest side-well. Fit all other components into the remaining crevices. Gates fit well in the slimmest wells of the tray. 

- Add a sheet of bubble wrap for cushioning. Place at least one of the remaining punch boards so that it nests inside the plastic tray with the bubble wrap securely beneath it.

- Carefully lower the bottom of the box onto the box. Then, with one hand on the bottom and one on the top, flip the box over.

- Ta-Da!)

RATING: 5
I finally managed to play the game, another player mentionned that it had some resemblance with Chaos in the old world. I think it's partially true, but there are some issues that does not make me love chaos more.

First, as you all know, the game is  amazingly expansive 200$+ and the box is huge in height (I still think that battle master could have a bigger volume) but is it a game worth that amount of money? I don't think so. The game is not that complex and could be considered good, but there is no reason to pay that much unless you are a collector or want miniature decorations for your house, or want to do some painiting. Because the price of the game is the miniatures, and cool mini won't make the game better. A 200$ candy land with cool mini is still horrible. 

But the "worst" part about the price, is that it comes with a shit load of expansions which are also very expansive. Now I understand that you could make some sort of collector editions that supplies cool mini, this is why there is a 300$ settlers of catan game in a wooden chest. But there are people that buy games to play them, and they won't pay 200$ for it. I think that having a version that replaces all minis with simply think card board tokens, and have mayby ancient ones have their token stand up would have been enough to cut the price of the game by half.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OK, so now let gets to the rules of the game, I managed to win the game, but I am not really sure how I managed to do this, it was almost a surprise: "So if I do the ritual, I win?" Not sure if the ritual system is broken, it's sure a way to end the game faster, which was getting pretty long.

The asymmetry of the Ancients seems interesting, not sure players were able to take advantage of it. A problems is that there many special abilities and exception, so a lot of the time, we simply forgot to apply certain rules. In chaos of the old world, there is little permanent upgrade, so it's harder to miss a rule.

Also, the game force you to get all your special powers, so acquiring them is pretty easy, because it's part of the objective, so you'll get all your spell book pretty fast. Which mean that you cannot focus on a specific ability path like in Star Craft or In Chaos, you are going to have everything. So you get in a situation where you get new abilities but have little chances to benefit from it that the next ability is already available. Giving 1 or 2 extra abilities would prevent the player to get them all and could force a strategic path.

We never ended up having much units on the board, there is a lot of territory to cover with few units, lots of cultist with little protections. Also all units has 1 HP, yes killing Cthulhu is as easy as killing a deep spawn. I though that the Axis and Allies days where over and the need to bring troop padding was replaced with something better, but in this case it's worst, because there is little padding. My entire army pool for cthulu is 2 star spawn, 2 shogoth and 4 deep ones. How much cover can I give to cthulu if I need to control multiple territories? Controlling more than 3 areas, is very hard to defend. But it seems like if the game would need more, the whole americas where empty for most of the game.

The other issue is the action system. You have a lot of action types, and movement is very expensive. Unless you are in the late game, you cannot move and attack immediately, you need to wait an entire turn before declaring your battles. So any player who does not want to engage you can simply move out before you declare your battle. This has also the issue of locking most unit in place, because there is not much mobility, units spawns and remain there which creates a very bad dynamic.

I think that they should have made their action other wise. First separate power (resource) from actions. You get a certain number of actions per turn, like 3-5, and the type of actions are probably more limited, something like: Produce Units, Move, Build Gate (They could be tokens like in Star Craft or Game of Thrones). Actions like war should have been implicit to movement, when you move, you can trigger a battle after movement. Also a move action could allow you to move any amount of units in a target area, so that it does not cost you a fortune to move units. While the build action, you would build as many units as you like in a specific area. As for capturing cultist, it would be an automatic effect of battle resolution, you capture 1 surviving cultist if undefended and the rest retreats for example.

The game allows you to share space with other players, but I am not sure it's actually a good things because if gives more rooms to players and we were not lacking of space. By forcing retreats after movements and battle, you get much more movement on the board increasing possible strategic maneuvers.

So in the end, it seemed to have some potential, but there are some issues with the game that does not make it appealing to play and cool miniatures does not make the game betters from my point of view. Does it worth paying 200$ for it, maybe if you need miniatures, but other wise, the game is far from being a master piece. 

If you are looking for a cheaper alternative with a similar theme, chaos in the old world could be the game for you. I did not like chaos much, but some parts were still interesting, lot of people like it, there are miniatures and of course ... it is much cheaper.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I enjoyed my first play although I realized I erred on my first turn and there wasn't any coming back to win from the mistake. Still finished second somehow. The different powers and abilities of each of the ancient ones really were difficult to remember out of the gate - this game would improve with repeat plays by veteran players as one learns how to best work the different powers and combos. Huge, overwrought minis but it does add to the charm to some degree.

Cthulhu Wars is a game in the genre of Chaos in the Old World that seems to offer more options to players and a heck of a lot bigger minis. The factions are all quite different due in part to the variety of spellbooks. It would take many plays to understand how to play and to react to each factions. The components are awesome in parts, but the tiny dice are ridicuous for such a game, as well as paper-thin faction cards. Overall a very nice game.

Light area control game. Production values are over the top as is the cost of the game. This i think results in people rating this thing higher that it deserves. Good game but nothing earth shattering here. 

Also not sure this thing is balanced and not scripted. Play follows the steps needed to get spells, then the game ends 1 turn later, each faction kind of has to do what it needs to do to fill out its spellbook with no variation (the conditions are set) Then its a race for points and i think certain factions have an edge here.

Rating based on 5 players.

An enjoyable game, with straightforward rules and huge, cool-looking miniatures. However, the asymmetry between the factions is huge, with multiple rule differences that change over the game; for the casual player or beginner, the variances are so great that it's almost like everyone has hidden goals--certainly not the case, but it feels that way when you're not familiar with the game. This game would definitely take multiple plays to get the full appreciation of the strategy without the game feeling chaotic. The miniatures are wonderfully detailed, but are so large it can be difficult to tell what's going on in the map, which is a bit annoying.

Always fun to play! Every game is different from others. And I love those great over-sized figures which are so beautifully done. The view of the board after few rounds is enough to have a play of this game!

The factions are so different and every faction has it's own over-powered skills, but still the game is balanced.

Overall, Cthulhu wars is a good game, but not great.  Massively overproduced with some interesting upgrades and asymmetric play are all positive.  But the game really drags.  It doesn't have enough in it to stop it becoming a case of punish the leader, and the built in timer of the doom track was ineffective to limit the game time.  Need to budget at least twice the time the box lists (120-180 rather than 60-90).  Plenty of other games in this genre (Ameritrash /euro hybrid) I'd much rather play.

The most amazing production value -- beautiful looking game. Gameplay is interesting...but definitely seems like a 3-player minimum but ideally 4 player or more game.

Played it again - w/ 3 players -- so much fun. Still a pain to get it out and put it away. But worth it.

"the rule book even provides suggestions on how to best maximize the powers of each faction, suggesting specific play styles, tactics, and strategies. The combat was probably the weakest element, as lowly monsters can eliminate the Great Old Ones with a single fortunate die roll, wiping out an entire turn's power investment. ... I would definitely play again, just to try out other factions."

RATING: 6
Mini's are too big.  The proportional differences are nice, but it's too big.  Their size also requires them to come in pieces, which looks cheap when assemblemed in contrast to a solid mold.  Despite all this, the gameplay, which is far more important, is fun.  Still a good game, which is surprising for a "not-mini-minis" gimmick.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Pretty decent for an asymmetric dudes on a map game, but that's not my style. I have serious doubts of real faction balance, but the bigger problem is the rich-get-richer aspect. The first turn can unbalance the players and leave one speeding ahead (requiring the other players to gang up on him) and one languishing, unable to get a foothold unless he risks leaving himself defenseless to rebuild and is lucky not to be stomped in intervening turns. But the game rewards picking on the weak. Not for me.

Game advertised as a 2 - 5 player game, bought it for my wife and I to enjoy, finding out that you need to have each player play 2 different factions in a 2 player game... huge disappointment. Then, official 2 Player rules are released and the game was very boring, and the 2 player rule variant was less then entertaining. The combat mechanic was also something that anyone I played the game with could not get behind.

RATING: 6.5
(Base game only, 3 players) This is actually a fairly light game and easy to learn, though not understanding the other factions (which is likely when you first learn the game) makes it hard to know how to counter them or really recognize threats.  You can learning to correct for that but it makes the amount you need to learn before play significantly more daunting.

The pace is quick and almost breezy and understanding what you can do on each turn is simple (Understanding what others can do, as mentioned above, is less so).  It's also a little less mean and in-your-face than I would have expected.

The production values are insanely over the top, but actually practical to get to the table so there's that.

Well, after months of waiting, the first tranche of this monster game arrived. The kickstarter campaign funded in July 2013, the (tentacle waving) insanely overly optimistic estimate for delivery was December 2013. After several delays, including changing production company, it actually arrived in Australia in February 2015; it’s fair to say I was very keen to get this out of the box and onto the table of honour. Fortunately, that was true of several other local backers and it wasn’t very hard to find other folk up for a game.

As one would expect, the production values are fantastic and the monsters, cultists and Gods sculpts are magnificent and very imposing on the board. Hats off to Green Eye Games for ensuring that a high quality product was delivered in the end, rather than something they weren’t quite satisfied with. My overall verdict is that it was worth the wait.

The game plays very well and after a couple of turns play becomes quite intuitive. Cthulhu Wars is a game of asymmetrical factions which, for mine, really adds to the enjoyment, challenge and replayability factors. The goal of each faction is to acquire over thirty (and the most) Doom Points as well as getting all six of their spellbooks into play. Spellbooks are acquired through meeting faction-specific goals whereas Doom points are acquired (usually) through ‘universal’ goals such as controlling gates or performing rituals of destruction. Players have a fine balance between attacking others and meeting their own goals. From my limited experience, a player who ‘turtles’ won’t win whereas one who is bold with their play, makes the best use of their faction-specific abilities and judicious in their attacks is as good a chance as anyone else.

In my first few games Great Cthulhu (who is probably the most straightforward of the factions) romped it in, but as players began to understand the abilities of other factions the Crawling Chaos did well. Yellow Sign seems to have a lot of potential while The Black Goat faction hasn’t really been fully explored as each time I have played it was run by quite conservative players.

All-in-all I have no regrets at all in backing this game as it looks great, plays well – it has a heap of replayability – and really hits he spot. I look forward to receiving another ten kilograms of plastic and cardboard when the second tranche ships sometime in the next six months or so.

If you look beneath the completely over-produced gloss this is actually a very good area control battle game. The pieces are just fantastic but you pay a heavy price for them.
Would the game work just aswell with smaller or cardboard pieces? Undoubtedly yes. 
Would it be as much fun to play? Definitely not! Being able to place massive "miniatures" on the board is tremendous fun, even if a single roll of 6 sends them back to the abyss.
My only concern with the game is that if a player suffers a major defeat (near annihilation) in the first couple of rounds then they are really out of contention for the rest of the game. This happened in both of the 2 games I have played. There is a catchup mechanism of allocating half the power of the leader, but this never covers the huge cost of rebuilding your forces and recovering lost ground.
Despite this concern, this is a fine game and one that I look forward to playing again.

An asymmetrical slugfest of epic proportions. Really enjoy the feel of every different faction. 

One of the pros and cons of this game is it is relatively short. I would have preferred a longer version of the game since it seems like it takes a while to get a strategy in place. But as a result this makes you have to create an extremely tight plan in order to stay ahead.

An amazingly excessive collection of bigatures that clearly shows the unwillingness to compromise.

The game improves very much when played frequently as strategies are learned and improved constantly.

The best part of Cthulhu Wars is how different the factions feel. Each one of them change your strategy so much that it is necessary to play with them a few times before fully understanding the strategic options you have.\

The production, of course, is also amazing. The figures are huge and well-made, so your inner-child will do somersaults when you finally summon one of the great old ones.

Finally, luck counts, but not as much as it seems. Sure, the dice may hate you and ruin your immediate plan, but, if you really prepare your faction well, you will win without a doubt.

The bad thing: the point system feels weird, especially the ritual thing. It makes a very thematic game feel suddenly very artificial. Other winning conditions could work better here, maybe even making winning the game a bit more engaging. Many times, especially with beginners, I see players focusing on conquering areas, summoning monsters, gaining power and having fun... but they forget to win.

The minis are spectacular and the rest of the components are very good. Surprisingly, the player mats are made of paper and not cardboard. Of course, big minis, big price.

It’s an All vs All combat and area control game, much in the vein of Chaos in the Old World. I’m not a huge fan of these games, where good performance is rewarded with a royal bashing by all your rivals.

It is asymmetric: all the factions have different units with many different powers. I don’t think this is as unbalancing as some claim, but it’s true that they are not very adaptable: they force you to follow a specific path of tactics and strategies in order to be able to win.

The theme (even as unlikely as a Great Old Ones battle for the Earth might seem in the Cthulhu Mythos context) and the minis are its most compelling features. But it doesn’t mean this is a bad game. It just isn’t a game for me. Players do not have enough control, they are too dependent on what others do, and trying to stay in the pack for 2 hours and pull off a surprise move at the last turn is not what I seek in a game.

I've played this twice, the second time straight after Blood Rage. In the shadow of Blood Rage, it really felt like a vastly inferior game in very similar territory. CitOW is one of my favorite games and Cthulhu Wars feels like an expensive knock off. Apparently CitOW was no inspiration for the designer... That sounds like bollocks. If this is true, maybe if he'd played CitOW he might have made a better game.

I am not a child, big plastic toys don't do it for me anymore, there has to be a game there too and I feel that Chthulhu Wars can't compete on its gameplay merits. If it was published with regular sized minis I doubt it would have made any splash at all. The trouble with games like this is that due to their price, people don't want to feel like a mug for having spent so much on it. People don't want their friends to feel like mugs for buying it. It's easy to diss a game that cost you $15, no one's that invested, but if they spend $150 you have to treat the damn thing like a painting their beloved Great-Grandfather.

Still, this game is not totally without merit. If you like big minis it's great. The Cthulhu mini is really nice, but not so sure about the other ones. Like a sapphic focused H R Geiger. I could be convinced to play it again on occasion and to be fair I've only played it twice, maybe, hopefully, its merit will shine through?

I was a KS contributor for this game, but it took me a couple of years before I played it. And after first try I was quite disappointed. After reading comments about the game I was under the assumption it was a great game not only nice figures, but unfortunately I was wrong. 

It's a decent game, but nothing special.

Fantastically beautiful game.  It's a show-stopper.  Had tons of people coming over to watch us play at IndyCon.  Owner generously ran multiple games.  Everyone enjoyed it and wanted to play again.

RATING: 10
Completely absorbing area control game. The stars of the show are the GOOs - their distinct abilities ring true with Lovecraft lore (as they should with Sandy Petersen at the helm) and provide a genuine asymmetrical experience. 

My only complaint would be that games are pretty short, but by all accounts this is a design choice and the idea is that you play a few games back-to-back in an evening, rather than one mammoth session. I can go with that - especially considering it's a game that really rewards multiple plays. You need to spend time experimenting with each faction to understand how best to play them.

Production quality is off the scale - fantastic miniatures (assuming that's a word you can use with models this size). It's so clearly a labour of love, from one Lovecraft fan to another, that if you've got the look, you're the target audience.

The sheer depth of strategies means that I can't imagine ever getting bored of Cthulhu Wars. And that's without the raft of expansions available. 

It's a very different take on Lovecraft than your usual fare - in Cthulhu Wars, humans play little or no part. There's no investigators left at the end of the world. Mankind is spent - we've already lost. This is where you go to immerse yourself completely in Lovecraftian lore and play out your fantasies, as the Gods and monsters that walk the remains of the Earth. This is the time of the Great Old Ones.

I made fun of this game when it first showed up on Kickstarter. But after seeing it for a good price on Amazon, I impulsively decided to take the plunge. Wow, was I ever surprised. Behind the simple rule-set is a game with huge amounts of depth. Each faction feels completely different, yet you need to understand each faction to be competitive. As such, I went all in on the second Kickstarter. 

My biggest surprise of 2015.

RATING: 10
Excellent game, very well balanced, faster than other similar games. I particularly love the theme.
A lot or variants in play, different options and expansions that are not necessary but enjoyable.

The two (kind of) minor points why it doesn't achieve a perfect 10:
- It is slightly overpriced; while the miniatures are excellent quality, the paper stock for faction sheets and trackers is rather thin and prone to breaking.
- The huge miniatures are really a work of art. Beautifully designed and they really give you the impression of being Great Old Ones... but they are either too big or the map is too small. Some of the times that I played we couldn't quite tell what region some figures where at as there was not enough space for all of them.

Other than that, the game is extremely enjoyable and I am always anxious to play it again.
Some people have said that its a knockoff of Chaos in the Old World. They do share some similarities, but at no point it feels like one is based of the other. Similarities are common in the gaming world but nobody calls Checkers a knockoff of chess.

This is a really fun dudes on the board game, where each player takes control of an elder-god cult. The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end, but each faction has a different set of 6 things they need to accomplish before they are eligible to win at all. Each time you accomplish one of the goals, you get to unlock a new faction power, which gives you different strategic paths you can follow as you play. Combat does involve dice, but one of the nice things about it is that the results are kind. A 1-3 is a miss, a 4 or 5 means one guy flees, and only a 6 is a kill. Defender assigns damage, so you can have your weenies eat the hits like in Twilight Imperium. It has beautiful miniatures, and just the right level of complexity for my tastes.

I finally got enough people together so I could play CW over the weekend. After 7 games (5 the first day) I think we all decided it was our favorite game. It is incredibly addicting and so much fun, when we weren't playing we were discussing opening moves and tactics. There is a ton of strategic depth, and we still kept finding new tricks and counter moves every time we played. 
The fact that the game was so quick to take down and set up meant we got in extra plays.

RATING: 6
Standard area control game with over-sized figures and too many expansions that do not seem to be properly balanced against each other (some combinations result in uninteresting games, for example discouraging combat). The basic mechanics are okay, but not brilliant, and the combat part is the least interesting one (one-shot kills for Great Old Ones is just thematically and mechanically boring).

The worst thing is the game offers no catch-up mechanisms despite having high degree of early-turn random that can put one far behind others (losing a gate in the first Doom phase based on a single die roll, for example).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.66
A tactical, but not very strategic war game with very nice figures.
In fact, the figures appear to be the entire selling point while the gameplay somewhat stagnates.
It's not bad, mind you.  Just run of the mill silly bash-the-leader-with-crazy-abilities nonsense fun.  
Like if Cosmic Encounter ripped off Chaos in the Old World, then turned the ridiculous asymmetric powers up to 11.

deep game with simple Mechanism.

Bad :

other:

Blood Rage is over ranking very much.
If Blood Rage is 25 rank, Cthulhu Wars is 10-15 rank.

Game play is very very fun.Quest,control gate and war.

This is a well designed and thematic game. It plays competitively and each faction plays differently. Mastering the game is related to the interplay of the strengths of the factions. Each faction is competitive. One bonus is that it is a simple enough game that after a hiatus of 6 months from play, you pick up the rules quickly without have to make a renewed study of the rulebook. The figures are very nice. (First reviewed: July 20,2017) Update: This game continues to hold up after repeated plays. Increased rating half-a-point.

Huge components and solid Cthulhu vibe from the creator of the original RPG. In my two plays, the game did feel way too long.

I've played this several times now, and I am thoroughly happy with the game.  I was thinking that the game would become this predestined charade very quickly, because the factions always start in the same area and they don't alter from game to game, but there is a depth to discovering the strategies and the turn-to-turn tactics in the game which make me believe that I'll be playing this for many years to come.

I'm impressed.  I was afraid the game would be all glitz plus random/political play.  But it's quite well done.  The core game is very simple, but the asymmetric factions add a lot of variety.  There is enough politics to provide balance to the highly asymmetric forces, but most interaction is driven by goals to further your own agenda (not just leader bashing or kingmaking or spite).  The whole thing is a lean 90 minutes despite looking like it will be an overwhelming time sync.

And the minis are great, especially the ones that are not so mini.

Blue (CC) is probably too good, but I'm willing to house rule it.  Technically, you can balance it with pure politics, but I don't like it when the entire game becomes just bashing the broken faction.  I'm sure minor fixes can solve the problem.

RATING: 7
21-05-2015. Rated after 1 play. Cthulhu Wars is a fun game with awesome components. 

The game itself is relatively straight foward and as such a little light for the huge amount of high quality components. The aim of the game is to end the game, have 6 spellbooks ánd have the most 'doom' points (ie. your VPs). 

During the game, you gain 1 power for each cultist you have on the map, 2 for each gateway you control. You then can spend that power to buy doom points and elder signs in the doom phase. It is here that one of the end-conditions of the game can be reached.

Afterwards, you go the the action phase where you can summon monsters, move, attack, control gateways etc.. Combat is incredibly simple. Count the total power of your units, roll that amount of dice. 4 or 5 is a pain, and people have to retreat to another area that doesn't contain the guy you are fighting. A 6 kills a unit. 

The game is fun, it's quite a good game. To me, it's a little like Chaos in the Old World light. I really, really like Chaos and this feels a little lower in complexity than I would have liked. The game in addition is incredibly expensive and way overproduced.

RATING: 7
This game brings memories of sitting at the table with an overview of the desolated wasteland that earth has become, while absurdly large monsters fill up the board preparing for what will inevitably be the gamewinning battle. That is how you know you are playing a great tabletop game.

I really wish I knew more about the Cthulhu lore to truly emerse myself into the theme of the game, but it is not really a genre that appeals to me. Despite my lack of interest in the theme, I have thoroughly enjoyed playing this game on a couple of occasions now. 

One minor flaw with the game, in my opinion, is that it is fairly easy for the leader of the game to rocket ahead without the other players being able to do anything about it. In our last game I spent my last turn of the round (as the last player with power) to take over 2 gates, leaving me with a total of 6. That gave me 6 points + a bunch of power, which I of course spent on the Ritual of Annihilation to gain myself another 6 points and an Elder sign (which turned out to be a +3)... So in one turn I scored half of the points needed to end the game, and there was nothing anybody could do about it. In this case it also ended the game in a very anti-climactic way.

So there might be a need for some house rules regarding the Ritual of Annihilation, so you can't buy your victory unhindered. But other than that this is a really fun game.

The allure here is the ridiculous and amazing miniatures. They're huge and well detailed. Perhaps a tad too big for the board when there are some big battles going on and you're trying to work out which pieces are in what region. So just playing it is an honour because those bits are so over the top.

The rest of the game is decent enough. Asymmetrical abilities will steer you to play in a certain way and it's well done. For instance, one ability makes movement cheap and easy and encourages spreading over the board to acquire your spell abilities. Another will add to your energy level unless your opponents agree to divvy up an energy loss between them. So it's fun dealing with all these extra battle abilities and whatnot.

That said, the rest of the game is your typical race to victory conditions game and deny it's ever you, least your opponents gang up on you. There's some hidden victory point tokens you draw throughout the game and that's meant to keep opponents guessing as to your true score. (In practice they don't really matter that much - average them out at one and a half and you're probably there.)

I'm not a big fan of the theme and the abstract nature of it. I can appreciate that by not giving the game a real world setting with some sort of historical theme it allowed the designers to be a lot more free and easy with the abilities of the sides, which is a bit part of the attraction of this game. So it makes sense. I'm just a bit dull and boring and prefer a real world setting as a personal preference. So if you like the whole Cthulhu scene then I highly recommend this. The bits alone will leave you drooling.

In a four-player game there are 4 players x 6 spellbooks so 24 variable conditional (have they been activated) powers. Additionally, about three  units per player may be different than other people's, meaning we are at about 36 player powers. I cannot keep track of them and, therefore, cannot play well.

Not much rules overhead, but a good amount of strategic depth. Each faction feels and plays very differently from the rest. The "miniatures" for this game are the showstopper!

RATING: 8
Like Chaos in the Old World without cards, and not just because it's about monsters corrupting the world. The action system is similar, 6 faction-specific spells/upgrades are key, there are 3 minor unit sculpts and the asymmetry is mind-boggling. Feels a bit like CitOW generalized, with variant factions, maps, turn order etc.

It's like Chaos in the Old World, only more epic, quick to teach, and able to hit my gaming table. 

Expansions provide a wealth of permutations and the sheer scale and quality of the game, from both a design and production standpoint, make it worth the cost of ownership.

I'm dreading Petersen games' next 'epic' release and the resultant destruction it will wage on wallets across the globe.

Not a bad game for this type of game.  Asymmetric nature of the different faction create interesting dynamic.  I don't know how balance each factions are but it is reasonably quick and fun enough that I don't mind it.  Would like to try different faction next time.  It is completely over produced and it is one of those game and I would much prefer smaller more portable version with the same rule.. if available.

Has good strategic depth and plays quickly.  While I normally shy away from die rolling, I find luck is seldom the deciding factor in this game.  The production values for the figures are terrific, my board showed a bit of wear and tear at the folding corners after a few uses.  I prefer this to blood rage which I also own and is the other hotness in this genre.

RATING: 10
This game is a Rush.....With an unbelievable toy factor.  The whole thing is overproduced but I wouldn't have it any other way.  A very fast paced area control game that encourages aggression.  You have to pick your spots for aggression wisely to not expose yourself but you will lose if you turtle.  Each faction plays differently and has multiple paths to victory and the interchangeability of the factions keeps things fresh and fluid.  I have yet to have this game flop and it is simple enough to use as a gateway with the four base factions.  

If you are looking for a centerpiece game that draws a crowd this is very much worth every penny.

Great game and the asymmetric play is wonderfully fun.

The expansion factions are well balanced (if requiring a shift in tactics both to play them and fight them)

The only criticisms I could level at it are the cost (but to be fair for the number and scale of miniatures, ready assembled, its pretty good) and the sheer amount of space you need to store it (note this is a storage issue, game play a reasonable size table is all you need)

I have such a high interest in obtaining this game.  Cthulhu Wars made me sit down and learn how to spell Cthulhu.  It takes one of my favorite games ever, Chaos in the Old World, and flips it on its head by making it more approachable and less fiddly than CitOW.  Cthulhu Wars has replaced CitOW for me, and I can't believe I said it, but I did.  The components, of course, are insanely gorgeous.  There's tons of expansions and it's a huge money sink.  But I want the game badly, because it's great.

RATING: 9.1
After another play, I am bumping this one up to a 9 and could go higher. A good friend said after an initial play, "This is the game that fired Kemet and Blood Rage." I couldn't agree more. It just hits all the right notes from a simple learning curve to getting up and running, to the deep strategic play of the assymetrical powers of the factions. The sculpts are simply amazing and it is also really fun. You really have to know the factions inside and out because one wrong move will wreck your game. So much fun. Highly highly recommended if you are will to spend the money. IMO, best investment I have made recently.

This is an amazingly balanced, asymmetric powers, Risk-ish style expansion and conquest game.  It quite literally fixes everything mechanically that I hate about Risk and does so with beautiful components and while keeping everything literally drenched in theme.  Initial games will not play fast due to the amount of reading you'll need to do whenever you change factions, but may well speed up to the stated play time once players know the faction spell books and powers.

This is just an initial rating, and based on the potential I could see, my rating may well rise with further plays.

RATING: 7.5
Dudes-on-a-map area control game where each player controls one of the Lovecraftian Great Old Ones (and thematically appropriate minions) -- which lucky cosmic horror will be the one to get enough doom points to consume the Earth?

Most of the charm is in the unique and thematically distinctive factions. Cthulhu is strong early and emerges from R'yleh to fight; Hastur focuses early on desecrating sites before becoming a late-game powerhouse. Nyarlathotep specializes in preying on the weak.  Each has six special abilities, which are unlocked for completing various achievements ("capture a cultist", "control 3 gates") and must all be unlocked in order to win. The order of doing so and requirements for completion are both strong drivers of strategy.

Combat is surprisingly de-emphasised: it's a valuable tool, but players have a lot to spend their action points on and may have more efficient methods than vulgar brutality.

My biggest concern is that this early flush of enthusiasm is being sustained by the breadth of content to explore. As in other games with distinctive factions (I last experienced this with Terra Mystica), you want to try every faction and you want to keep trying until you get it right. The big question is always how well the play holds up once that early exploration is over; I'm worried at its potential to become scripted.

At this point I expect that most games will be fairly close, at least between the front-runners, which means that luck (particularly in the elder sign draw) can and will be decisive. Perhaps more serious a problem is the potential for runaway losers: there is every incentive to prey on the weak and the game length seems such that the catch-up mechanism will very rarely actually put someone back in the game. That isn't a problem per se, but could easily result in a poor experience, especially for a new player.

I have a troubled history with this genre so I'm shocked by how much I like Cthulhu Wars. I hate Risk; I traded Nexus Ops; I sold Fortress America. Whenever I finish a game of this one I want to immediately play it again.

---

More plays in, it's still very enjoyable. The game scales remarkably well to higher player counts, and the downtime is the only reason I would rarely choose to play with more than 4 or 5. 

I can scarcely recall a game where the winner was not decided based on variability in elder sign draw, however -- there are usually two front-runners and the rest further behind.

Simple rules, but there is a lot of variety in the different creatures and the factions seemed very distinct. Good battle gameplay with a focus on improving your own position, and a need to occasionally trade off power for extra points. Great minis. Easy to learn and relatively fast-playing for such an epic game - games typically take about an hour and a half or so.

Area control game where players attempt to conquer the world and various gates.  Spectacular components and a good ruleset, but the size of the pieces compared to the board can be a problem when trying to place them within an area.  The monetary cost and that I find Conquest of Nerath to be a better game with a similar feel stops me from adding Cthulhu Wars to my collection.

RATING: 8
Somewhat similar to Risk, but much more interesting and takes shorter time. The wide range of special abilities and differing play styles for the factions is the main draw.
The main problem is that the game, at least when the 3 expansion factions are in play, requires players to be at a similar skill level and pursue aggression.
The Sleeper faction needs reworking as it's overpowered and bland.

Fun game, well designed, with rules that are clear and simple. The complexity lies in the factions. I would say that it takes a handful of plays of each faction to 1. learn the best strategy to succeed at the faction and 2. learn how to thwart the other factions. For this, only, does it get 9 instead of 10. You have to commit to play consistently, with people who also play consistency to have good balance.

Also, the "miniatures" are awesome and give the game a great look and feel.

RATING: 9
An impressive game, and I mean the gameplay, the game pieces and its price tag of course.

The ruleset is not too complicated. However, there is still a lot of information to digest: each faction has its own set of special actions.

Surprisingly good game - a well thought out, simple and clean design, that is still complex and has a reasonable play time for it's ammount of complexity. I also like the asymetric design of the factions.

BUT - the game is massively overproduced and the "miniatures" are ridiculously big. I am not sure, what the myriad expansions are really adding to the game. And the Theme and the game don't really match all that well.
The price point is laughable for a board game. Even with the "miniatures" I might be willing to pay 75 Euros for this - not 200. I assume, this production was more about getting the miniatures than practical game pieces - which of course justifies the price if you are into that sort of thing.

All in all Cthuluhu Wars is the perfect example of what is wrong with Kickstarter-Projects with thousands of Stretch-Goals and Expansions and Bulls***.

TL;DR: Nice game - for 50-75 Euros I'd propably buy it. For 200? Not a chance.

RATING: 6
I'm not sure how I feel about this one.  I have a decent amount of fun while playing it and the bits are probably the best (and certainly the biggest) I've seen, but the game play itself doesn't really stand out.  The balance between factions seems off (Cthulhu should be tough to beat most sessions) and the pacing is off (the game seems to abruptly end just when the action is ramping up).  Combat is really simple; that's not necessarily a bad thing for this type of game, but there's not much incentive to engage in combat.  I also think there isn't much cohesiveness with the spellbooks -- some of them conflict with each other rather than complement each other.

Overall, I wouldn't say it's a dud but this game really needed more thorough and extensive playtesting so that the gameplay could be even close to as marvelous as the minis.  As is, Chaos in the Old World is a much better game for a much lower price if you want to wage war between terrifying gods.

I should give a disclaimer that I do like that each faction has different goals that are reflected in how players should approach their actions.  The fellow newbie players I've played with so far perhaps didn't adequately take advantage of their factions' distinctiveness, which may have negatively affected my appreciation for the design.

The trademark of a good game is the discussions and stories after the game. This game has plenty of this. Simple and clean design with amazing components. The different Old Ones bring a layer of complexity until all players are familiar with them, but they are Great Ones after all! It has luck, so it is not for Euro-centrists. Players need to coordinate against the leading player, and this element is key for balance. No, this game is not for everyone, but it is a blast that like these kind of games!

RATING: 7
I start with separated comments about each play until I round-up all the base factions. Then, my overall thoughts about the game itself.

***

[b]Comments after first play, with Shub-Niggurath:[/b]

It was, at best, just an OK start for [thing=139976][/thing]. There are thematics bits throughout - like the easy time the Black Goat has to put units in the board, since it has a thousand young. Though is a little weird that the shoggoth went to work for Cthulhu, but I guess the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Anyway, the game itself do have a lot of resemblance to [thing=43111][/thing], but doesn't seem to be a better game.

It is indeed easier to play and to teach, which are definitely pluses, but for gamers, it offers less than [thing=43111][/thing]. I don't find all that depth that I read some write about - but I did play it only once, so I won't say it isn't there. But Chaos sure have more to do, a much richer game, and seems less scripted. Once I read the spells of Shub, I put them in the order I wanted to take them, and I guess, in a second play with it, I would use the same order, maybe changing the fifth and sixth spells.

I will see if the same happen with the others.

So far, to me, in [thing=43111][/thing] the game state changes more. There are events, and the several cards each has make the game a whole lot different each time. Not only in response to others, but also by the game itself.

Without events and with fixed six spells (it would be better if each faction had like 10, 12 spells, you you have to choose among these to pick six, so then you would have really different games - but I know that this would be crazy hard to balance, however, I blame KS for part of this, since with a big time in development, that many games have, it wouldn't be impossible to have a bigger number of spells).

***

[b]Comments after second play, with Hastur:[/b]

This faction seemed, after the first play, the hardest to play. It do appears to be true, as the King in Yellow requires a good deal of luck, at first, to do some early desacrations. And, aftwerwards, it needs to travel with the whole gang of ghouls, which leaves guarding the portals though for the faction (and it has to have at least one cultist or monster in a place with a desacration for it to be worth a power). Also, it has to "travel de world", as the desacrations, that are worth spellbooks, have to be made in some spots on the board. But is still indeed possible for it to win, it just require a longer game, without much fighting. And, once Hastur is in play, almost every GOO will flee from it.

For the game as a whole. It is really different to play with a different faction, as one has to do different things to gain spellbooks, and also to behave differently, as the monsters and spells allow for other approaches to several things. To add to this, I didn't felt as much with Hastur as with Shub that the spells are basically meant to be taken in a set order, still, some are much more useful than others, and I will probably take one of two first in most, if not every, play (as what I took first, was basically the same as the player that used Hastur in our first play).

The play itself did wasn't similar. This time we fought more, and did way less annihilation rituals (only one in the whole game, in the first, the track went all the way until the end).

***

[b]Comments after third play, with Nyarlathotep:[/b]

With Nyarla I felt the need to expand slowly, building only portals after units were there to protect it. I didn't found one of its spells to be way better than others - the best, to me, was the one that takes power from others, but it requires Nyarla itself on the board. I also enjoyed the one that turns the Nightgaunt into kamikazes - some powerful moves can be made with them this way, specially together with the Hunting Horrors ability (with a spell) to join the fight from anywhere.

I probably would have a tough time to power up enough to gain all the spells and still have a strong presence in the board if wasn't for the spotlight that went to Cthulhu, once it jumped in the score track. I also saw an amazing bash the leader, as the other three factions got together and took almost everything from Cthulhu, except for one portal - and this was even with Cthulhu winning two battles against Shub.

The Hastur player struggled most of the game, failing in the desacration rolls and overall playing badly - he also felt that this faction is the hardest to play (but, by now, might be a little of groupthink, still, he is, as far as I know it, right). Shub did his thing, sprawling through the board, and, as I did, and the player in the second game did, the first two spellbooks were the one that allow to bring monster cheaper and to use Dark Youngs are cultists. No surprise at all here. The Cthulhu player didn't follow the same path I saw, mostly because the player that used it before were seriosly lacking in the "using spells properly" department, but I was warned that, in a play I didn't participated, the spells followed mostly in the same order. Hastur didn't used the spell that allows for Ghouls to change Cultists of others into Ghouls - this was the first one I took, as the cultists, early on, aren't well protected yet (however, you do get some enemies early, but is not like anyone is really your friend).

This play also didn't had much annihilation rituals, as I was the first to play in the round, and usually passed to save power, and the others followed suit - only the Cthulhu player did one, and you saw above what good this did to him. The first player do sets the mood of the round.

Playing Nyarla was, as expected, different from the other two. The overall play was also - mainly because the sea battles of Cthulhu and Shub (four battles, not one with conclusive results), and this leave Asia, Europe and the Artic all to me. Hastur itself didn't appeared in the game.

***

[b]Comments after fourth play, with Cthulhu:[/b]

Well, Cthulhu is easy to play with. Very straightforward. I started with the spell that allows Cthulhu to gain power from other factions portals that occupy ocean spaces. The next was Devolve, that can turn cultists into Deep Ones. My third that I got when Cthulhu appeared on the board, was Submerge. Seems like a usual opening, as the other books, though useful, revolve around higher cost monsters - Starspawns (cost 3) and Shoggoths (cost 2), and I can't imagine they being much of use early in the game. The Dreams book I can see beign nasty at a proper time.

Anyway, Cthulhu sure gets easily its spells. The easiest by a country mile. I understand this as a balance issue, since Cthulhu doesn't get as much power as Shub-Niggurath with its Dark Youngs as cultists and discount on monsters; nor Hastur and the free monsters when desecrating; nor the boost of power that Nyarlathotep can get. So the monsters of Cthulhu faction appear slower, but, coupled with the easier spells and the lower cost to put Cthulhu back in the game, all balance out, which is nice.

What I discovered, while playing Cthulhu, is that he has no business fighting against Nyarlathotep - this is their nemesis faction. The Flying Polips can prevent the attacks of units, the Nightgaunt can eliminate even the resilient Starspawns, the Hunting Horrors basically nulify the Submerge power of showing anywhere, and if Nyarlathotep is involved, chances are it will get a boost, either in power or ir elder signs. Not good. I tryed three times and failed everything in being effective (though I did went to battle not all that well prepared, but this usually don't matter as much when fighting the Hastur's or Shub's faction).

Shub did nothing the whole game, losing portals early and never recovering. Hastur could have went better. Nyarlathotep trounced, putting Cthulhu to sleep and winning over a battle against Shub-Niggurath, for a total of four elder signs. Turtling sure works well for Nyarla. With its portals well covered, no one could stop its run to the 30 doom points and the win.

***

[b]Overall thoughts:[/b] [thing=139976][/thing] is a good game. Not an awesome one - three of the four players that were in all the games above, were a little tired of it - the plays are different enough, but the feel is mainly the same, and a bad start usually meant you lose - not once someone that started behing made a comeback, as no one will help you get up (it is more likely that you will be kicked while down). The rule that the player gets at least half the amount of the person with the most power helps in this, but not all that much.

Luck plays less of a part in the game than one could expect. I can say none of my plays were decided by luck (though, in the second game, the King in Yellow failed a lot in rolls needing 5 or less). Only one play that I heard of was decided by good luck, as one player, with Cthulhu, grabbed 3 elder signs for a total of 8 doom points, and other, with Hastur, took 6 elder signs, for a total of 7 doom points, and the game ended 30 to 28 for Cthulhu. Not the usual stuff, though, and I mention this only to say it is clear that the game do have luck built-in, but it is a feature, not a bug.

The components, oh, the components. Really nice, specially the talked to exhaustion miniatures. I sure can see where the price tag comes from. Miniatures are expensive, and considering the amount and size, it is probably a better deal to buy the game, throw out the rules and tokens, and only keep the miniatures for other purposes than to buy them separated. Basically the game is a bonus. Well, almost.

As the game is what this is all about. So, after four plays, is better than my initial impressions let me see? Yes, it is. There are more possibilities, and the balance of the factions is there - a commendable feat considering all the variables between spells, type of monsters, GOOs and powers. I was sure surprise to see a remarkable level of polishness CW has, as KS games usually lack in this department. Can't vouch for the many, many expansions still to come, though, but now I can give the Petersen Games the benefit of the doubt.

Still, [thing=43111][/thing] works better for me. It seems to contain, and sustain, more game, while also having a much - MUCH - lower ticket price of entering. As things are, I played, not long ago, CoW two times, and in both I had more invested, with the gameplay beign richer in options.

I'm a big Lovecraft fan (and have several games with this theme), and have plenty of Sandy Petersen's material for CoC RPG, so I know this dude knows the Mythos and care for it, which is pretty good for the game. If I found CW really cheap (like, say, US$ 75-90, probably someone owning to the mob and in need to pay them in 24 hrs) I would buy it, since the game is good enough for casual play, and the minis are sweet to look at. As is, I not only won't buy it, as I will also not recommend it for those buying it for the [i]game[/i] inside the box. No need to go crazy, there are plenty of awesome choices around with a fraction of the cost. They won't look as good, sure, but will play at the same, or higher level.

Horrible bloated dice fest with overblown minis. Seriously needs a catch-up mechanism. If you let someone get ahead they not only get more points next round, they also get more power points which makes it easier to stay ahead.

Ramped up version of a Risk style game.  Cthulhu Wars is more about the miniatures than the game play.  The strategies for each GOO faction are monolithic so once you figure them out there is not much variation on how you play, other than reacting to opponent's moves.  The action point system creates situations where players may wait 30 minutes between turns or have a series of actions after everyone has passed.  Add 40K level dice rolling and you have an Ameritrash game to the core.

Fun area control game. I hear a lot of complaints that it's just a simplified version of Chaos In the Old World. Which makes it a perfect weeknight game. Easy to explain, plays in under 2hrs. Factions are asymmetric. Lots of variety with the number of factions available, different maps and independent monsters. 

Miniatures are overproduced, but for me that adds to the fun. Overpriced? I don't know how people objectively value games.

Cthulhu Wars is really a beer & pretzel area control game with dice combat and special player powers. Not sure why some people refer to it as some sort of "Chaos In The Old World Light" - CITOW's gameplay feels completely different, focusing more on majorities and subtle card play. The oversized miniatures of Cthulhu Wars are nicely made, even though most of the monster sculpts do not appeal to me. As for the sculpts of the Great Old Ones: those are really, really strange, except for Cthulhu himself - that sculpt is one of the most impressive I have ever seen. Cthulhu Wars is "just" a fun game that plays fast and is easy to learn. Just not terribly engrossing, and certainly not worth the price. Also, I am a bit concerned about the replayability - at least without the expansions. That is not a lot of room for experimenting with the factions in the base game, as each spell and player power almost dictates how the faction should be played.

Holy Moly, what a design! The giant minis are merely icing on the cake to an incredible asymmetric game. Blows Chaos in the Old World out of the water (which wasn't that hard for me to begin with, as I don't have super high opinion already).

This is one of those spectacle games that looks really intimidating but it really is an asymmetric Risk that happens to be much better than Risk.

Every faction plays different and every faction is fun (except Red/The Black Goat, which sucked until a friend told me how to play it properly).  Whether you're playing with experienced players or new players, it feels like every faction has a good chance of winning assuming they play well.

My biggest complaint about this game is the game makes the winning player win more.  They always get to go first, determine the player direction, and have the most options.  It's not a huge negative, but you can generally see one player start to win, and then they keep winning because the game reinforces that.

RATING: 8.5
The game is surprisingly lighter than I thought, and this is a common reaction.  You think this is going to be a sprawling dudes on a map game, but it's fast and aggressive, something you can teach and play through in 90 minutes with lots of actions and reactions, and that's something special.  If you want a very tactical game where you're chucking dice at your friends, you can't do much better than this.

That's not to say that the game is simple.  It's simple to teach but with a breadth of variability and strategies.  You could play this game regularly for months and you'd just be fine-tuning strategies, building opening moves, then  having your friends learn how to shut down those moves and you have to find new strategies.  There's just a ton here, especially if you dive into the never-ending expansions.

Nothing groundbreaking, but the miniatures make this game a work of art. I dig the theme, and frankly, don't mind the similarities to Chaos in the Old World. Both have their share of scripted openings, but the rules here are easier to teach for new players less fiddly between rounds. I've seen a lot of reviews gripe about the cost, but compared to X-Wing or Armada, I don't see this game being more expensive. Those games do offer more variation upon repeated plays, but this is still a solid game.

Very fun asymmetrical area control game. Think Blood Rage on steroids. It has a lot of moving parts and lots to keep track of. The components and among the best out there. I feel it's a game that will shine after many plays. It can be overwhelming to keep track of your own upgrades let alone everyone else's. The gam play itself is pretty basic. The complexity comes in the variable powers. Still lots of fun. Not for new or novice gamers

[i]Preliminary rating after one 3p game (it might go up after more plays):[/i]

Pretty cool area control game. Asymmetrical factions guarantee a high replayability value. The core rules of the game are simple, but it will take a lot of plays to fully understand the intricacies of how each army works - the tactical possibilities are quite overwhelming at first (which is a good thing). 

I can't say that I like the combat system (which is too simple and random for my taste), but battles aren't central to the gameplay - Cthulhu Wars is not about brute force (or at least not always), it's deeper and more interesting than that. 

Unfortunately the component quality is really disappointing and I find it unacceptable for this price. The player boards ale ultra thin and the overall look of the main board and cardboard tokens is very underwhelming (I wouldn't go as far and call the components ugly, but I find them to be rather dull). The miniatures' size is ridiculous - there's no need for them to be so big (apart from justifying the price of the game).

I’m always on the lookout for hybrid euro-ameritrash games. I’ve generally found that they scratch my particular itch of wanting theme married with good mechanics. On the other hand, the Cthulhu Mythos does absolutely nothing for me. I’ve tried Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror, and Elder Sign before and the mechanics were never enough for me to keep playing. When Cthulhu Wars came around people kept talking about Chaos in the Old World whenever they’d mention it, and the designer—Sandy Petersen—claimed that Chaos was influential in it’s design. Well, Chaos in the Old World is one of my favorite games, so I was interested and decided to pick it up.

In my first (and only game so far), we had four players. I was The Black Goat, the fertility cult that reproduces very quickly. My game was different than everyone else’s: turtling at first, getting more power gradually, and using my Great Old One to provide discounts later in order to get points through elder signs and rituals of annihilation.

On the one hand, I had a good game and won. On the other hand, I was expecting a game with a lot of combat and dice rolling, but I managed to stay almost entirely out of combat and did very well as a result of it. I enjoy games that promote various strategies, but I would have liked to see combat bring more advantages to the winner.

Oh, and the miniatures are nuts and the board is beautiful, but most of the other components feel junky for a $200 MSRP game.

Tentatively recommended. Needs more plays.

Ordered (online store, not Kickstarter) - Could resist no longer. I have a soft spot for HP Lovecraft after discovering a faded paper back short story collection at an Uncle's house as a kid (the perfect way to discover Lovecraft), but I'm not a Cthulhu nut, and the only other Mythos game in my collection might be Creatures and Cultists.

So Cthulhu Wars wasn't a must buy, and Chaos in the Old World may be a better game. But Cthulhu Wars is more likely to hit the table with the people I play with, given its accessibility and quicker playing time, and those minis look good. So it wins the indulgent let's-hope-I-don't-regret-this purchase of the year spot.

Update: Mini's are pretty good but some of the joins are pretty huge. Player boards are cheap thin cardboard, shame. No regrets, but no need or desire to purchase expansions, etc.

Excellent game, way more than miniatures. The game seems extremely complicated at first, but then after the first few rounds you understand what you're supposed to be doing. I love the fact that each faction plays completely different. If you use the same strategy that has worked with Cthulu using Yellow Sign, you will definitely lose the game. 

For a $200 game I was disappointed with some of the quality of the components. The trackers that you get with the game are on thick paper and have already bent. The big miniatures look awesome, but they seem to be pretty poorly put together.

That being said, the gameplay of the game is fantastic. I love playing this game.

After decades of Cthulhu games (which to me always fell flat on the grandiose nature Cthulhu being some planet killing creature deserved) finally we get one where Cthulhu rising to destroy the world really plays out with feeling.  At first the big miniatures made me avoid it (with over produced plastic like that how good a game could it be right?)  But my trepidations were false. Its insanely good (this is not Mythos Axis and Allies but a game with rich, yet tightly tuned, asymmetry capable of deep strategic exploration -- it makes Terra Mystica or Cosmic Encounters feel symmetrical such is its wildness).  Plus after a bit the big plastic becomes comfortable.  

Kudos to Sandy Petersen and his team for raising the bar on our hobby.  Can't wait for Glorantha Gods War!

What I like the most about this game is that it combines an Epic kind of feeling with a short gameplay, but still having variety and high intensity in the gameplay. Few games do this. CW is fast-paced, highly strategic and visually stunning game. My only negative point is that the game is not as much enjoying when played with a mixture of experienced gamers and total newbies. You cannot possibly win unless you know exactly what you´re doing, which is impossible to teach and leads to the first few games being more of a trial experience to everybody.

Gameplay feels a metric ton different to CHAOS IN THE OLD WORLD, but would I want to own both? No. So I sold Chaos.

VERY easy to get blind-sided, until you understand the various killer strategies each faction can thwack you with.

[b]Our win/loss results:[/b]

Yellow Sign: 1
Crawling Chaos: 2
Black Goat: 2
Cthulhu: 4
Opener of the Way: 1
Tcho-Tcho: 1
Sleeper: 1

[i]Our results being dominated by Cthulhu are the end-point of groupthink, and the fact that Cthulhu is the easiest, most straightforward Great Old One to play, IMHO. Interestingly, everyone else I've met thinks that Yellow Sign is the most powerful - yet no one can pull off a Hastur victory. UPDATE: Until April 2015 - when Andrew nailed it![/i]

It's a funny old game, I think, in that at some point you WILL get punched in the face by an opponent - probably when you are at your weakest. This is a game in which you must be prepared to take your licks, and sometimes the game feels unfair - it's just the nature of [i]Cthulhu Wars[/i].
If you don't like direct confrontation, or other players ganging up on you, I advise you not to play this game. It's less fighty than you expect, but the skirmishes may very well upset opponents (I've seen it happen).

In the game's favour, any faction has the ability to pull back from very bloody early defeats. You might feel like you will lose, but this is anybody's game, actually.

This is one of the rarest of games, in that I actually fear some of the other players' spellbooks (powers & abilities) when I play. Each faction has ridiculous game-breaking super-powers, that feel less powerful when you're actually controlling them. BUT, if you're on the other end of that power? Well, it's another story!

[i]I Kickstarted this bleeder for the giant unholy miniatures, and the hope of a great game - luckily, I received both in the box after a long wait![/i]

DEC 2015 UPDATE: Raised my rating from '9' to '10' - the extra factions (beyond the initial 4) have added so much awesome sauce to the experience, I can't rate Cthulhu Wars any lower, at this point.

RATING: N/A
Unpunched & great shape (excepting standard shelfwear)

Nov 2014 - Traded to George S. (Gunsarge) for Yaquinto's Swashbuckler that turned out to be missing counters. Only justification I can make for that is that I had rewatched the 70's Three Musketeer movies when I put Swashbuckler on my "wanted" list. But I do like Tactical games, and a game about brawling and is about as tactical as one can get!

If the second edition makes this one look like old garbage... then how come the map palette on this first edition is superior? I don't want MBT maps that look to be interchangeable with IDF. This first edition actually looks like Central Europe (and fits the counters on the hexes).

That's about all you can say for it, though. Tactical boardgaming of high-tempo modern mechanized warfare won't teach you much that you can't learn from some simple reading. The number-crunching is fine... if you're using it to create/test a computerized game.

I'd stick to computers exclusively for high-tempo tactical... and then get into board wargaming at the grand tactical and operational levels, where there's more meat to chew on. But if you like miniatures (more than simulation), MBT could very well float your zodiac.

Tried to play it and like it, but was discouraged after reading the rules : Too complex and heavy for what it does. Too much looking at tables and too many die rolls.

With Panzer back in circulation, been revisiting this. There are a couple of ways in which I like the MBT/IDF system a little better (cleaner spotting rules & the simultaneous fire phase mainly, but the artillery rules are also a lot more interesting but but probably specific to the modern period), but in general Panzer is a better and cleaner re-implementation of basically the same game. Still, this is a very fine and fairly playable (by grognard standards) classic that has a really nice feel for the super-lethality of the (putative) cold-war era battlefield. As I mention below, it feels pretty hardware-centric when you initially look at it, but the modeling of morale factors is actually pretty good, and remember the scale (hexes are 100m, 3-ish times the size of (A)SL hexes, with average gun duels taking place at ranges 2-3+ times the range of the longest shot you're ever likely to take in a non-desert ASL scenario). The suppression mechanic makes a lot more sense at this scale. A lot of really admirable game design decisions in here, this was from the period in AH's history when they were making some of their finest games: Turning Point: Stalingrad, Breakout: Normandy, Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, Republic of Rome, ASL, and so on. It's not all completely awesome: you'll probably want to house-rule a couple things; if you do DYO you'll want to experiment with Soviet forces that don't use the sometimes frustrating doctrine rules; and utter and complete awesomeness of the M1 tanks does raise eyebrows (I've enjoyed German vs. Soviet scenarios more). But these aren't major issues. This is still a very good game.
---
One of the great tactical games that didn't quite seem to make it the way it deserved, probably because the topic isn't quite the major draw. Gets sold short for being too hardware-oriented, but I quite liked the excellent, simple, command & control rules that do a much better job even than SL. Not a true classic, but a very nice game.

I weighted this as Medium, but that was with basic rules only.  Playing with all the advanced rules would definitely add weight/time to the session, but it would also allow for a wider range of tactical options.  Actually, I think that more play time, and familiarity  with "da rulz"  would probably lower the play weight.  
One thing that is confusing is that you can't move, then fire, or fire while moving.  All firing is done at the beginning of the turn, then movement.  Unrealistic, and confusing. Plus, I'm just not that much of a Grognard.

RATING: 7.5
Lots of manuever and thinking before firing.  The command phase makes one think more and act in a judicious and sound fashion.  Simultaneous combat keeps things fair, even when you do not have initiative.  There are just as many ancillary counters for: marking fire/movement/spotting, turrets position, command and control, wreckage, smoke, artillery spotting, etc. than there are MBT and weapons counters. Cannot wait to get beyond the basic game and introduce artillery, fire teams, and AFVs.  The inability of the Soviets to adapt individually to changing battlefield situations allows the NATO player to engage larger numbers of opfor tanks and still have a balanced game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Same rule set as IDF, but set in Cold War europe.  It is a lot of fun, but be prepared to do some hardcore reading, or have a patient friend play it with you the first couple of times.  I would not consider this an entry level game.  Still once you pick it up, it is loads of fun.

RATING: 8
Very Good: Tactical - Modern - Medium / Difficult

Plus:
-Fantastis topic: WW III armor combat
-Amazing components
-Combat system works very well 
-Great orders systems (fire, overwatch, movement, fire/move etc.)
-Scenario generator ensures unendless variety of games 
-Very tense and reminds me of the computer game 'Steel Pantherss' from SSI

Minus:
-Rules are not easy togasp and it takes a couple of times before everything falls in place. However, I guess some won't reach this point and give up.
-Turret counters are cumbersome.


Elements of ATS and ASL but simpler. If you like the cold war and if you like a tctical game,you will love this game.

It's tank-on-tank combat in 1980s Europe!  This game and it's sister, IDF, are two of may absolute favorites!  I LOVE THESE GAMES!  Rules are similar to Firepower, and to an extent, to Tac Air.  The rules can also be used with miniatures.  Endless scenario variation and skillfully designed geomorphic boards make for a masterpiece!

RATING: 7
The basic game isn't complicated, 1 tank vs 1 tank is easy enough, and fun.

Command control is good, I would give Soviets extra points if they keep their tanks in adjacent hexes, as per Soviet "100 meters apart" doctrine. "Panzer" does something like this with 6.2.1.1.3 Sharing Available Commands. The rules are online, so you could reasonably add some Panzer rules to taste.
The "1 vehicle is 3" Doctrine sounds stupid, but actually does simulate Soviet Company formations.

There are no Morale rules or Hidden rules. Again, "Panzer" fixes these egregious omissions under "Option Rules", as well as fun rules about starting fires, and a "Kelley's Heroes" rule about tanks will long barrels in alleys.

The data cards are good.

You could make a simpler game that is more realistic.

Overall, it is workable.

A great tactical AH wargame. Very detailed at what it does, possibly at the cost of some playability. Lacks maneuvering room on the map compared to the force levels (at least with real life doctrine), and has a somewhat 'chessy' feel to it - read this for my full opinion: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/185916

Some of the home made material, found referenced here on BGG is truly excellent!
GMT Games hes released an updated version, which addresses some of my complaints, but not all of them - but based on the playtest material, the new version is clearly a better game

A fun game with a fair amount of detail on modern armored combat.  Not nearly as detailed rules-wise (chrome) as ASL, but lacking some of the 'flavor' due to the lack of robust/involved morale rules.  The simultaneous placement of 'hidden' orders imposes some command & control limitations unlike the omniscience of ASL.  The Gamers' TCS series (now MMP) offers even more C&C limitations for those looking for less player control.  My one 'beef' with MBT from a [b]game play[/b] perspective is the near invulnerability of the M1A1 tank, which makes IDF, MBT's sister game, more fun to play at times.

The game mechanics are quite good, but then I always liked order chits games. Surprisingly, the firing procedure, while involved, is not so difficult: the tables are intimidating, but the process is quite straight-forward. I've found the movement more difficult: while mechanically standard fare for a hex-and-counter wargame, the densely cluttered terrain makes things hard – moving your tank a single hex, you could find yourself factoring elevation changes, road fractional bonus, terrain cost and other things, all together. On the other hand, the difficult terrain makes battles more interesting, with an emphasis on maneuvering. Look for those weak spots on that Abrams' armor, and hit'em hard! Final note: did everyone have fingers so nimble, back in the old days? I've found the turret counters really hard to handle!

I remember having a lot of fun with this when it came out. However, by modern standards, it's fairly involved and definitely involves a lot of moving parts. I wouldn't knock most games by that standard, but because this is a tactical game, I thought it dragged a little bit. Very table heavy, but par for the course considering the large number of vehicles that were in play.

All in all, I think it'd still be fun, but it's less appealing given similar computer games like Steel Panthers/Combat Mission. (In fact, a modern version of the latter would be the perfect replacement for this game.)

This rating partially accounts for the "nostalgia/days when I had a lot more time" factor. Of course, if I were transported to back then, I would rate this an easy 10.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  Tactical.

Taught me that the M1 really is a badass tank (and this was back in the 80s I think).

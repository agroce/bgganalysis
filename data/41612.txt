This is a great solitaire game on creating and maintaining a powerful galactic empire while the forces of chaos try to bring it all crashing down.  You put out a lot of random fires, but it stretches your resources thin.

The rule book is clear, but the layout sucks.  Once you understand the game, it is easy to pick back up and find stuff, but it is kind of tough wrapping the mind around it for the first time.  I created an enhanced sequence of play you can get from the files section to iron it out.

The game has a lot of variability from game to game and a number of scenarios to make it a great value for the money.  I own the first edition and it is fine.

RATING: 8
A really excellent science-fiction game. It's like sitting on a table back in the early eighties with all the wonders of the universe coming to life with just a paper map and some cardboard counters. Wonderfully old-school. It's not easy at first and it will take you two or three lost plays to get into it, but then it works beautifully.

An uninspired and dull solitaire system. 90% of the time you are admining the AI, and there's really nothing to hang your imagination onto to make it interesting, as the scope is so gigantic with nothing to really tie it into anything else.

RATING: 7
Solitaire games are tough to rate because you generally only get out of them what you put into them, especially when there is no actual history to compare against. Assuming the rules mechanics are sound, and in this game I believe they are, the only real question is whether or not you have fun.

So far, yes, it's fun. The random events can be interesting, frustrating and hilarious all at the same time. The map looks good and is nicely laid out, with all the relevant charts easily accessible. The rules are pretty clear, with a few trivial ambiguities which you can easily decide for yourself how to handle.

Update: After playing again for the first time in a while, I decided that there was too much narrative, not enough decision making. It can still be fun, it's just not what I'm looking for any more. Sold.

RATING: 4.5
I really, really wanted to like this game. I very much enjoy science fiction and the thought of managing a galaxy-spanning empire sounded like fun. Instead, at least for me, it was just a bunch of random, unrelated tedium. The spiral map, while amazingly thematic, could be confusing as you count your way towards the galaxy center.

Acquired Feb 2010 - Good Solitaire Game with a relatively decent rulebook.  Some things are hard to find, but I've seen much worse!  Game play is chaotic but fun and quite tense at times.  Numerous scenarios make this one a winner.  I suggest using all the optional rules from the onset.  Nice Production Value.

Just picked this up in the discount area of my local boardgame store.  Played through the first scenario and I really enjoyed it.  A lot of your strategy revolves around deciding how to react to various random Chaos events that pop up each round.  The good news is that there is a diverse mix of events that can occur.  I also like how the various enemy factions act and function differently. There is a lot of book keeping and chart consulting involved, but overall, a very enjoyable solo game that I will be playing for a while.

Update2: Finally played it, it took me about 5+ hours to handle this beast for the first 10 round scenario. I liked it a lot, a perfect chaotic empire managing gameplay, it remind me a bit of the total war series, overall an excellent unique gameplay experience that has no match out there, i really need to buy a clipper for the chits..
============================
Update1: I m ready to begin the game (after 2 years that collects dust on the shelve), the countersheets are the worst i 've ever seen until now. It also needs an extra d10, and 3 bags to draw the chits, awful production values for such an expensive game...

RATING: 6.5
I contrast this game to owning a 40'-50's car to a modern one. No power brakes, steering, windows. The radio has mechanical station buttons and on the list goes. Frequent maintenance & much physical interface required to operate.  
If only this game could be given something like a Victory Points Game treatment_ Cards with info for chaos events, a friendly rule book. Sized Tokens with info and attractive graphics. And much less charts & tables. (can't believe some of the odds & randomness couldn't of been handled by hidden mechanics through cards and procedure) 

Game has great theme and enjoyable unit/event variety with play. 

Not being a wargamer I can't appreciate the small chits, and multitude of charts/tables and war game style of rule book design .
 I enjoy playing, but 'gawd' the work micro-managing the story forward takes the story enjoyment right out of it. 

Maybe someday a modernized version will be created. 
( do Trans-humans dream of electric sheep ?) 
Something to move it along...
I'm afraid once this game is shelved it will never be played again .. a pity really.

RATING: N/A
after a video review and reading comments.

It seems to be a pretty heavy games which is not elegant in any way. There is a huge amount of tables and check to do. The rule book is very procedural and seem hard to remember. 

The quality of the components is questionable for it's price. Why thy used event chits instead of event cards with the results directly on the cards instead of digging in the rule book.

I think the idea is interesting but it demands polishing. 
---------------------------------------------------------------
After reading some comments

Seems very complex and most of the time is spent in the rule book. There is no forward planning and most of the game seems about handling tons minor threat, and making a lot of dice rolls. the game feels boring and repetitive.

Many creative ideas from Joe Mianda on this sic-fi wargame design...!  What Struggle of Galactic Empires strikes me is the solo game design (pretty much on your own in space), randomization of the story (invasion from the outside or internal turmoils), and Joseph the designer's creative solution to people's imagination about space, in association with Issac Asimov's Foundation series and Galactic Empires series freely, vaguely and ambitiously. I always love Joe's idea to demonstrate two assymetrical sides how to dealing with each other with their own advantages. Pretty much looking forward to it.

RATING: 4
This is a solitaire game with an obvious genealogy back to Fall of Rome (which is neither good or bad, just a little uninventive I guess).  The rules are really badly organised with every action you take being dependent on bits that are described five or 10 pages apart (e.g., for most events you look at the back of the rulebook, and then back into the middle on how empires, usurpers etc operate). However, they're not very long either, so the deficiency is not crippling.

In play, this proved to be a disappointment. The game is almost completely random. As the galaxy is typically swamped by events every turn (a usurper, and independent empire, a couple of invaders, and a couple of aliens is not unlikely, and [i]all on one turn[/i]), there is no real sense of planning. There is zero strategy on the other side (although at least the tactical moves that some of the opponents, e.g., usurpers or independent empires, make are sort of reasonable).  Combat is essentially a crapshoot, and a mere -2 die difference at [i]any[/i] differential, even the maximum +6, will completely kill an attacking force, so optimizing force mixture is completely pointless.  Since you can expect to lose your force in about 40% of attacks even with maximum force advantage, and your leaders are at best average (usurpers are always better than anything you have), it's best to blanket the galaxy with thinly spread units, stay largely on the defense, and hope that an attacking force rolls badly.  Overall, there is no narrative to speak of, as the situation with always five or six threats at the same time is just so wacky, and at the same time repetitive.    You just deal with about 50-80 faceless minor threats per scenario and that's it.  

Still, for people who have lots of free time and don't mind endless dierolling and being at the mercy of the dice, this might be a way to while away the hours.  A good game to take with you on an antarctic expedition or to a military outpost but perhaps not much else.

Summary: not very nutritious fare, makes me long to play SPI's Sword and the Stars instead.

RATING: 5
Doesn't work for me. It seems that I spend most of my playing time working through game systems for the AI and checking all the rules for the little differences and details between chaos groups. When it comes to my turn, I have a number of straightforward tactical choices. I feel almost like I am an observer in a semi-random story rather than an active player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An enjoyable solitaire game and it manages to be fun even though it lacks a little bit of soul. It is so procedural as to make the play experience a little mechanical. I would have liked to seen some sort of tech tree but the game isn't about creating an galactic empire/civilization. It is more about maintaining the peace. It's a struggle for sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I give this game a 7.5, because I like the gameplay and the old sci-fi theme, and I think the game make you feel how an empire try to maintain balance in a galaxy where chaos dwells, wich is the goal of this game. The map is awesome, and does a good job of having everything you need to play the game, without being clogged.  The counters are nice. It would score a little more if the rulebook was better.  However, I bumped my rating a little, because I learned how to play the game much better now, and learned how to use the rulebook properly. With some strategy and planning during combat, the all or nothing, fatal roll of one die, can be avoided most of the time (with a strong leader in your stack, and an illumination marker).  It's too bad this game seem to have passed under the radar.  But if you like science fiction and solitaire gaming, this game have a lot to deliver.

[u]10-Sep-2016[/u]:  I only got in one play of this before sending it to another gamer, but I did enjoy it.  It's a pretty interesting sci-fi game with a decent amount of chaos, dice rolling, and rules checks.  The theme is pretty strong, but the gameplay did not bode well for me pulling this off the shelf often enough to keep it, especially at several hours for one session.  The game comes with several scenarios, so some of the others may have offered a deeper experience.  It's definitely worth a look for solo gamers with a strong sci-fi leaning.  But it does have a wargame's rulebook, and you'll be chucking dice a lot.

neat attempt at solitaire sci-fi setting.   plenty of scenarios included out of the box.  

gave up on it after a couple of plays mainly because of a lack of interest in much solitaire board gaming, but i think this is a good system and an undercovered setting - especially for solitaire gaming.

A fun solitaire wargame. The rules are fairly simple (by wargame standards, anyway) and the game proceeds at a brisk pace. There are a couple of disadvantages, though - there's a ton of bookkeeping to be done, especially if the player is doing poorly (in other words, more enemy units are on the board). Furthermore, the chaos events that start every turn are interesting, particularly the flavorful ones such as "Don't Forget to Crush the Empire" and "The Institute," their random nature means that there's not much in the way of a narrative structure, which is disappointing.

Thematic, epic, immersive and a must-have for fans of Asimov's Foundation series. Rules are a bit confusing when dealing with some key concepts. Moderately complex.

I do not usually go for solitaire games, or 3DW games either for that matter, but I bought this as I wanted a space war themed game. The map and counter are pretty and it has a simple enough system where the player has to restore order to the galaxy. Under your command are spaceships, colonies and psy-controllers, which are blue on the front when controlled by you and red on the reverse if they turn to chaos. There is a chaos level and the higher the chaos the more counters are drawn to provide usurpers, invaders, rebels and the like, which you then have to defeat, but if chaos rises too high you lose.

RATING: 8
A solitaire game of managing a galactic empire in decline. You try to staunch the loss of your empire and combat your enemies to restore the glory and span of your empire by the end of the game.

[b]What's to like:[/b]
:d10-1: 7 different scenarios come with the game. Each seems different thematically and puts the player in a different position, some more difficult than others. This should help the replay value.
:d10-2: Tons of randomness. You can play the same scenario multiple times have have very different narratives each time. This is accomplished in large part due to the random event chits, of which there are many. The tables & charts in the game are resolved by die rolls and also add randomness. This should also help replay value.
:d10-3: Theme! What's better than trying to save your despotic (or free) galactic empire from your enemies? Well, lots, but this is a great theme. The different types of forces at your disposal, morphogenic combat, independent empires, rebels, alien invaders, etc., all add to the theme and variety.
:d10-4: The components are cool. Okay, so they're not spectacular, but I think they fit the game and I really like them. I really like the map, even though it's unmounted paper.

[b]What are the turn offs?[/b]
:d10-1: Too much randomness for some people. Some players may feel like they're just responding to multiple fires without any pattern or strategy. It doesn't bother me, but others have complained of this.
:d10-2: The theme may not grab you. If it doesn't then don't try this.

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I really like this game. I think it's fun. The random events constantly throw kinks into my plans. The big force I was going to use against the large independent empire near my core? Well it was just converted by a usurper and is now moving toward my capital worlds. I've also lost massive fleets to improbably bad die rolls, but hey it was fun and thematic once I got over the shock. I dig the theme and I recommend this to solitaire gamers who don't mind sci-fi and have a few hours to play it through.

The generic designations for the actors in the game, such as "usurpers", "invaders", reminds me of the austerity of Outreach.  Basically, an SPI approach.  I like it.   Let me fill in the details with my own imagination.  The automated Chaos enemies in the game remind me of the Raiders and Outworlders of Sword and the Stars.   I'm enjoying this game, so far.   It's a lot of work to facilitate all of the automated elements, but that is to be expected in a solitaire game.

I found this game to be a procedural slog through turn phase after turn phase of drawing chits and checking and re-checking spaces on the map in order to apply various effects, with the added problem that the game state is often difficult to grasp visually. The game even shorts you a second d10, which you'll definitely want to have, as well as spare tokens to use as reminders of what's going on when and where. Oh, and there's the usual difficulty punching Decision Games' substandard counters. All in all, just not a very user-friendly game.

Acquired 12/10/2010

Review 12/14:

A promising concept for a solitaire game not well realized. 

There are five primary problems with Struggle. First, the CRT yields only all-or-nothing results, which means entire stacks are lost or converted without inflicting any damage on the enemy. Thus, "wars of attrition" are an impossibility. This makes the only strategy for dealing with any threat to build up a huge fleet in hopes of taking it out in one roll.

Second, the nature of the threats are all very similar. The way you deal with an Usurper or Rebels is practically the same. The Aliens are all so similar except for one niggly rules detail that you will find yourself constantly referencing the guide for them. These combine to make a game that requires frequent rules references and large maintanance times for very little gameplay progress. 

Third, the random sector table is terribly designed. 43% of all rolls on the table will require re-rolls if you are trying to determine a system sector. There needs to be a separate table for system sector randomization, or at the very least, color-code the table so you can tell that you've rolled a non-system sector before finding it on the map.

A fourth problem is the old "double-book accounting" problem, as you need to either very carefully keep track of your losses and gains in systems and soldiers constantly throughout the turn, or you need to reevaluate the board each turn in order to keep track of the numbers. I came up with a system involving colored stones to ease the accounting chores, but still: YEARGH! There must be a better solution, and for all the effort it takes, the accounting subsystem isn't even that deep.

The fifth problem is the death spiral that is easy to enter. Failed combats or bad events lead to a loss of income and increase in Chaos Index, which in turn result in the loss of ability to deal with problems and the increase in the growth of Chaos events.


The third problem is easily overcome by creating a new table; the second problem can be moderated with experience with the system, but only so much; and the remaining are unsolvable without serious game re-design.

And, this is only a personal preference now, the game mostly supports only one of the four Xs - Extermination. I would have liked more focus on Explore, Expand and Exploit. Solitaire games can be about much more than reacting to randomly generated problems, and while it can be difficult to create an engine that allows for meaningful choices and goals, Struggle does not strive to be more than a reactive game.

All that said, there is a good game underneath all of this, and if I had the wherewithal, I would spend time reworking it into the fine gem of a game I can see underneath the cruft.

Tedious. Soulless. Any solo game will require some degree of bookkeeping, but this is just nuts.

It's interesting, but I'm not sure yet if its "fun."  Lots of slogging...which I enjoy because I expected that in this game. However, I am wondering if this is a "game" or if it would be better classified as a solo "experience."
I can't even rate this yet.
I am having fun discovering what this has to bring, but the jury's out.  If I can ultimately find ways to get tactical and use strategy it'll be a thumbs up. If it's always just going to be "throw dice and react" then, meh.

Need to setup for another round. Really interesting game that is fairly methodical and laborious, but has potential to be something unique.

It's a particular game. Seems an unofficial version of Asimov's Foundation, and the game really conveys that theme. The problem is that such a big empire sometimes turns into a huge book-keeping task, but the IA is great and the scenerios give you different gaming experiences. It's an old solitaire wargame, and if you accept it, you will love this game. If not, it will be just a 240 minutes game of rolling dice and moving counters.

Rating after 1 play.  Maybe I just got off to a lucky start, but scenario 1 was not remotely challenging.  Turns mostly consisted of swarming the hostile units that randomly appeared each turn and converting them.  Not as interesting as I was hoping.  Since you were basically just chasing down random events, there was not really any strategy.

I hope I could like this game.
But, I feel this game is too dry for my taste.

I had a hard time with this one.  The design-for-effect works, but it creates a lot of rules exceptions for front line battle hexes.  This plays a lot differently than your typical Hammer of the Scots-style Columbia block game, and in this case, that is a good thing.
The best part of this game is the command structure & supply rules.  They are the best one I have seen from Columbia yet: it's better than Bobby Lee AND Eastfront.
It is good, but I just like Gettysburg 150 a lot better.

RATING: 6
Just in and straight on the table! First impressions: rather a lot of poor quality blocks but with plenty of spares (allowing for those 'fallen' labels - what ARE they for?) this is not really a show stopper. The other components are up to Columbia's high standards. My copy came with v1.1 rules, so I needn't have bothered downloading the v0.7 from CG's site, but its handy to be able to search a PDF.(March 2007)

RATING: 7.5
A very good and simple Gettysburg battle game. The HQs are the heart of the game and it uses simple rules to derive a similar problem that comanders face during the heat of battle. 

Both sides play differently. A big plus point in that.

Once upon a time, Columbia Games produced amazing games with very good art and quality components.

Now they produce cookie cutter games that, sadly, are unsatisfying.

The rules are clunky, the game is... needy, the art isn't, and it uses the same mechanics games set up in the Middle Ages, antiquity, and World War 2 use. They are no longer creating new games. They are like Marge Simpson modifying the same dress every time she went out with the socialites.

And the socialites knew it.

Is [i]Gettysburg[/i] bad? No. But make no mistake, [i]Gettysburg[/i] isn't good, either. At best, it is pedestrian, ugly, and average. From GMT, sure, what would you expect? But from the makers of Napoleon (3rd Edition) and the Front series, I expected greatness. Not this.

RATING: 8
I really like the command rules in this game. You can't attack with every unit you have all the time or you will deplete your ability to attack and resupply comes too infrequently. Efficient use of your leaders is an absolute must. This aspect turns a regular wargame into almost a puzzle as you try to keep fresh units in the hotspots. Very different kind of game if you haven't played a wargame with some form of command or leadership rules.

Once again Columbia has done a great job of distilling a conflict down into an easily playable game while retaining many of the important factors that came into play in the conflict. Who would have thought you could get step reduction, command & control, LOS, linear formations, cavalry and supply all presented in 9 fairly easy pages of rules. Maybe this isn't the definitive presentation of this battle but it's a great, [b]playable[/b] game that doesn't bog you down with tons of rules. It's by no means a fast game but what game covering the three days of Gettysburg at the brigade level is?!?

Latest version of the rules - 1.1

Not a hack-and-slash game, but somewhat chesslike. Play with care. Too many headquarters I think. This limits a good view on your fighting forces.
The use of the optional Column & Line rule was not a success. But without I believe I'll miss something. This is one point that could be improved. Another one is that initiative is too random and there is no relation with the battlefield situation.

RATING: 5
Well, I must say that this was rather dissapointing. I am a huge fan of block games, and a huge fan of this battle. But this game simply does not do a great job of simulating this battle. The only way the Confederates can force the Union to engage is the double turn. But to set themself up to exploit the double turn, they have to put themself into a vulnerable position if they do not get it. This makes Day 1 an exercise in the Rebels chasing the union back, and hoping for a double turn. If they do not get it, the union can either simply move another two hexes, or likely blow away a rebel block or two with little hazard to themselves.

it is simply far too easy to execute an ordered retreat. You cannot shoot at someone unless you are adjacent, and you cannot melee them unless you start the turn adjacent. So the union simply backs up two hexes, safe in the knowledge that there is nothing that the Confederacy can doa bout it. I am at a loss to explain how the Rebels can execute a historical first day attack against a Union player who realizes that there is no reason to ever stay on the ridge, and simply moving back until the rest of the Union army arrives is the best course.
There is no flanking in the game. How can you fight a civil war battle without flanks? Or morale?

The Confederate attack from the north on Day 1 into the flank of the Union trying to defend from Heth? So what, there are no flanks, what does the union care?

Unless I am mssing something, and I hope I am, this might be my largest disapointment ever - my expectations were rather high, and I doubt I will play this again.

Initial rating based on a single solo play.  I have recently become enamored of block games...something about the tactile feel and look of the blocks that I really like.  This game has the benefit of being one of the few tactical level block games with a modicum of depth and complexity.  The full three day battle looks like it will take multiple sessions.

RATING: 4
(2008-10-17) I like certain elements -- the hidden strengths, the divisional and corps integrity and command control, for instance are nice features.  However, the activate for combat or rebuild mechanic just doesn't work for me.  I also felt the roll each turn for initiative introduced to much randomness into the game.  This evening I played for the first time against a guy who has played it several times and always won as the Confederates on day one -- I can see how if the Union player makes the mistake of actually trying to attack anywhere.  I passively defended and used all my activations to rebuild depleted units and by the end of the 7pm turn it was obvious that he was not going to have a remote chance for a day one victory, and I was actually in about the historical position for the Union for Day Two.  As far as I'm concerned, it's a boring game for the Union player if that is the way he has to play it.

Brigade level Gettysburg block wargame.  Very simple mechanics for fire, movement and melee which anyone familiar with Columbia block games will pick up very quickly.  However, division HQ command steps are required to bring your brigades into action, and to resupply your spent troops.  Corps and Army HQ steps prop up the divisional HQ's.  Extremely elegant design that makes you worry about command and control, and not the rulebook.  Early days, but an exciting new design.

Very, very impressive. Really keeps the excitement going with its simple rules and yet, the game also has a lot of tactical and operational decisions for both sides to make. The way the game does the command structures of both armies is simple, innovative and really brings out the flavour of how to manage the 2 armies. The game is quite long though if you attempt to play all three days in one sitting.

RATING: 7.5
My rating is after first play!
The game was real fun to play, we started reading the rules at 9:00 Pm, we ended the first day of battle at 01:00 AM.
It was a Union near victory.
The game mechanic is very simple abd easy to learn, but as all the columbia games there is alot of strategy here.
The fog of war given by the blocks work particulary well.
This game uses a variable initiative and the possibility of the enemy to have a double turn must be carefully considered when u draw your line of battle,a double turn for the confederate expecially in the first day can be really devastating for the union expecially if u place your  line one hex from the enemy.
In this game the fire phase is before the movement phase and if u fire u cant move.
So normally the confederate moves forward, it get hit by the union and on a second turn it get to shoot and melee on the units the union used to fire on him. 
So the union player must decide if he want to stand and shoot or move away from the confederate units.
In the case of a confederate double turn , the CSA units can make contect with the union line and in the second turn shoot (but u never know in advance if u will get a double turn).
Normally u can make road block with units to prevent this double move.
Units have zocs so if u place some units  
out of your line, u sacrifice them, but u make very difficult for the enemy catch your main line.
Another very important apect of the game is that u can move freely your units around the battlefield but to attack u must use up a step from your Divisional Hq, so the attack possibility is limited 
Corps Hq can use  their steps to resupply their Div Hq making the offensive go forward where they want. (very nice system)
Confederate have better Hq (more steps) than the union player.
In the end a very deep game with simple rules highly recommanded, i think that with some expertize u can play a day of battle in 2-3 hours.
I look forwar to lay again this game!!!

RATING: 7
The command system is a gem and reproduces faithfully the tempo of the battlefield, with long period of inactivity and 2/3 turns of mayhem from time to time.

Still, I was a bit disappointed by how much of the end result depends on the initiative die-roll. Basically, the camp without the initiative has a 50% chance of a double-turn. While you are not attacking and in contact with your foe, it does not matter much. When you are, it can be decisive as you only fire in your turn. So :
- Always launch an attack when you do not have the initiative
- Pray that you will loose it quickly.

I am not sure what that represents. As a game, it is frustrating to see all plans go to moot because of the lack of double-turn.

RATING: 6
An interesting interpretation of the famous battle with a great command/control system. However, there are too many blocks and not enough room to move them around. The system will shine in smaller battles or just with a bigger map. One big problem with the game is that Law's Alabama brigade cannot mathematically take Little Round Top from Vincent's brigade. That is a HUGE problem.

Good: Tactical - American Civil War - Easy 

Plus:
-Innovative system with Supreme and divison HQ's determining the amount of action 
-Great quality components
-Accessible 
-Tense & bloody
-Quite good historic feel.

Minus:
-I wonder if areas would have worked better. The hexes give a cramped feel and functinalityof areas would have meade it more functional and evocative if you ask me.
-The blocks as limited intellgence have hardly any function here.
-Replay value rather limited; you can play three days but the options available are more or less the same with each play.  

One of the best playable and fun games on the battle. 
I am not particularly interested in the ACW but picked it up as Columbia had some special offers. It was the game I was leased interested in of the ones ordered but that quickly changed. So far this is an excellent game that is playable, tense, fun and a reasonable simulation too. Top production value. Backdraw would be the block density at times but I prefer this to a stack of counters (there are 19 USA Divison HQ's...). Recommended. Played again and had lot's of fun again. Easy system that promoses lot's of action. I'd love to see a Napoleonic title but for God sake not Austerlitz. This hads been done over and over again and I would suggest Columbia to do Eylau / Waterloo / Wagram or so but I guess except waterloo these names are not well known enough for a publisher like Columbia. Anyhow, I would be happy to see Austerlitz but honestly it is absolutely not original. See review.

Revisited: when I replayed it was not a good feel; the hexes and systems felt wrong somehow. 

Sold it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Nice implementation of the Eastfront/Westfront system to one of ACW's most famous battles.

Corps and divisional integrity play a major role in this one, and frontline hexes quite often turn into logistical puzzles.

My only concern so far is that replayability might be not very high given the map's pretty limited size and the scripted reinforcements.

I love block games, but this one doesn't work.  While not an authority on the Civil War, I've done enough reading to realize that the system does not portray the battle well.  The block fog of war does not work well here, the lack of flanking penalties, the way the union retreats one hex per turn and the confederates try to get a double turn - it just doesn't work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Turned off by many of the aspects of the system - units felt too slow and undersupplied compared to their historical counterparts.  Also did not care for the effect of the double turn (which could result in Pickett's charge taking no casualties on the way in), though it is necessary for the Rebels to have any success with their attacks. (otherwise the Union just keeps backing up because disengagement from the enemy isn't penalized enough)  All in all, I feel it's pretty undercooked.

This is a FUN game.  I like the blocks, but they take up a lot of room, so the hexes are over-large.  It plays well, but the supply/ammunition system is too tight, so you can't really recreate the actual situation of July 1-3, 1863.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game adds a command dimension to the typical Columbia block game system that I have come to know through Hammer of the Scots and Liberty. Since read Killer Angles and visiting the battlefield, Gettysburg is a subject that I enjoy exploring.   Melee attacks without outflanking the opponent or softening them up with fire attacks can easily backfire.  The command mechanics add an interesting element to the game on one level but they also contribute to the fact that this game just feels much less elegant than the other block games I've played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Painless told me this is an excellent game...just that he is not playing it with me.  The subject had been gamed, simulated and tested to death.  But the fog-of-war, with the use of blocks, perhaps is the first time it has been ever done.  Again, I have been cautious about the use of blocks to simulate fog-of-war, because you know the positions of the troops once they are revealed.  And you can memorize them by heart.  There is simply no point to be back on, unless you have the place to manouver and mix your troops often so to confuse your opponent.  Anyway, that's another long topic.

First play solo. Rules were reasonably well-written and very manageable. So far, it's the best block game I have (others are HotS, Wizard Kings, Bobby Lee, and Sam Grant). The Union got trounced by the Confederates after only one day (probably due to dumb tactics). I'd like to see more "what-if's" scenarios--the free deployment is a bit limited.

The game is rich in theme and plays very well as a historic simulation. I like how the brigades are rated. They are for the most part pretty accurate which helps recreate how they performed during the actual battle. So you get units such as the Iron Brigade and Barksdale's brigade being strong while units such as Iverson's being weaker. 

The rulebook could use to be a bit clearer however.

Only played solitaire so far, but I do like the game very much. It may seem odd at first that about one quarter of your units are HQs, but the command system is what makes GBoC so interesting. It imposes restricions on movement and attacking that appear (to me) realistic, but is not cumbersome.

1 play. A very accurate feel for the battle without the 40 page rule manual you might get with other games. I really like Columbia's games, sold this one only because I just couldn't imagine getting it on the table more than once a year, and I like so many of Columbia's games just a little bit better.

Also A House Divided is a better Civil War game for me. It is more fun and less complex at the same time.

Update 2012:  Playing Shiloh reminded me that I shouldn't recall this too fondly. I'm not a fan of the command system seen here, in Shiloh, and in Eastfront. When kludged up with the corps and division command restrictions, you don't end up with a more meaningful simulation, but you do end up with more frustration and time consuming play.

Love Gettysburg, Love this game. It may need a tiny bit of tweeking. but sure is a good game. I'm always worrying about my leaders being sniped at by artillery. Then there's the problem of stacking a group of leaders together so your opponent thinks it's a strong position. Plus the fact it's hard to believe this scale and fog of war. You could see the units. Still working on house rules. I'm sure everyone has a couple for this one. But it's still loads of fun.

A good example of how simple mechanics can reflect tactics, instead of lots of die-roll modifiers or tables.  Take flanking, for example - there are no rules for flanking in the game.  And yet, due to the mechanics for firing and meleeing, protecting one's flanks is essential.

I also like the need to keep divisional integrity and to not waste precious command capability.

If I had to choose one Gettysburg battle game this would be it.Why?  Simple, good simulation, fun to play, few pieces and rules.Yes contrary to some, the blocks add a great deal of uncertainty, especiallyconsidering command limitations and supply exhaustion. Union playerneeds to be careful on day one as reinforcements don't have to enter the exact entry road.  Rules allow enough wiggle room here to allow reinforcements to suddenly appear on adjacent entry roads.  This helpseliminate the gamey feel found in many other Gettysburg battle games.

Pretty fun.  The activation system really makes you think about what you want to do, as moving units causes leaders to lose steps.  Very limiting and an interesting way to replicate the logistic difficulties of the time.  I waged a vicious battle right in the middle of town, and the street outside my apartment (High Street) ran red with blood.

Never played; unpunched counters, clean map.

Some interesting stuff in this "Aliens" inspired game. But it isnt enough to make up for the steep price and (as a solitaire anyway) poor replayability. Could be better with an expansion, but total that with the costs of shipping etc. and you've easily spent over $40...there are better games out there for the price...

Its plays just as well solo as it does against a human or alien player. The battles are quick, intense and dirty.

It seems to cost too much, to move the marines as a group. Dosen't feel like a there is a team trying to enter a space station (there is a variant posted from the designer which addresses this, with this variant this game is a 7 for me). 

Very heavy on the luck side (extremly variable number of aliens spawnn every round, lucky card draw for the alien player can mean victory or loss right from the beginning, marines are killed with just on lucky die roll). 

For me Space Hulk has more tactical depth.

Still a nice game.

I like this game, but it is tricky to rate.

It is a tense, fun game for those times when you have the itch to play Awful Green Things or other Alien shoot-em-ups, but want a faster, slightly darker game that tells a decent narrative.  

This title has a couple twists that really add to the narrative ... the Adrenaline Surge and Marine Counterattack particularly.  

The game is well thought out, with rules that "make sense" for lack of a better term.  For example, rolling low is bad, rolling a "1" can be especially bad.  Rolling high is good, rolling a "6" can be fantastic.

The rules regarding doors are a notable exception.  The way door opening interrupts movement and the impact of adjacent aliens takes a bit of getting used to, but to be fair I'm not sure they could have been more clearly presented.

The interplay of action points and movement in general is a bit odd as well.  It is extremely expensive to quickly move your marine squad as a group, so games tend to degenerate into a few heroes running around the space station.  We found with repeated play however that we became better at managing the marines as a group, which includes sacrificing squad members and using the clock.

The artwork is very well done, both the counters and the map.  Unfortunately the components' physical quality (other than the counters) is poor for the cover price of $35 particularly when compared to the professionalism seen in Battles or MMP Special Operations Magazines, or for that matter many boxed games.  Would it have killed the bottomline to laminate the maps or print them on heavier card stock so they stay flat?  

The component quality simply doesn't do the artwork and game play justice.

While I like the game, it faces two hurtles in getting onto my table.   I have to be in the mood of a quick, light Alien Shooter to play.  Within the genre I'd give the game play of this title an 8, maybe even a 9.  I don't like the genre, but I like this game.

Realistically though I would never buy this game for $35.  I'm sorry, there are too many other, very good games I would buy for that price.  How did I get a copy?  I got lucky when I acquired a box of half a dozen magazine games ... ironically for $35.

I had never heard of this game, but I am glad I have a copy.

It is a perfect example of the love-dislike (hate is too strong a word) relationship I have with Victory Point Games.  VPG brings us titles that others (perhaps for economic reasons) choose not to publish, but these oddballs come at a price.

If you are a fan of the Alien shoot-em-up genre you should very seriously consider Forlorn: Hope.  If you like games with colorful narratives, particularly if you find yourself humming tunes from related movies while playing, you should take a good look at this game.  

Particularly if you find it at a sale price ;-)

Might just be everything Space Hulk is mechanic-wise, but no hassle. Doesn't have the wow toy factor, but not sure how important that really is for me.

tactical combat game. Think space hulk, space marines vs Aliens.

Only played the solitaire scenarios. Liked the game and appreciate the support from Christopher Taylor, who obviously cares about replying to inquires on the game. I like the concept of the team of marines working together with limited action points to accomplish the mission.  I think it works well as a solitaire game - lots of planning involved to figure out what to do during the turn.  Marines have different abilities so it's fun to plot the turn and then execute it.  Xenos are rough on the Marines though - one hit (if not heroic) and your Marine is gone.  I would have liked to see more objects to grab and it would be cool to have them face down so you don't know what they are until picked up.

RATING: 7
Wow! did they ever name this right.  The humans are really up against the wall in this game.  My first play, and I got totally smoked by the Xenos.  I know we got some things wrong, but it was a learning experience.  Kudos to Victory Point Games - this is a lot of game in a small package.  I like it.

RATING: 9
Lots of fun in a small package!

It plays more tactical like Doom (which is a good thing)and it has some smart rule mechanics (like no Action Point limit for a single unit).

Furthermore it has solo rules (which becomes more and more important)!

So, you want to toast some Aliens, but without needing a giant table and painted minis?
Get Forlorn Hope!

I've solitaired a scenario and it was good fun. Components are less outrageous than Space Hulk, of course, and gameplay in many ways comparable. The use of action points AND movement points (some actions require the one, some the other) is a bit confusing. Also, with the APs given, reaction fire isn't very strong.

Oh, I so want to like this game more.  I traded my copy of Space Hulk away because this game is better.  BTW, it is better, but it suffers too much from being able to put all of your points on one guy.  You end up with Sergeant Fox, track star, too many times.

Rock solid game!  Portable, fluid rules, lots of tension with the dice rolls.  If you're into this type of game you'll see it's a credit to its genre.  There is a high luck element and units are fragile, which can amount to games that are over quickly.  Check it out, especially if you love a game that plays well solitaire.  Expansions please?

RATING: 6
Maybe this would have been more appealing if it had been something like a Fantasy Flight production (for component quality), but as for the game itself, although I like the theme, I didn't find game play engaging, even though I think designer Chris Taylor is very clever. Not that there's anything wrong with the rules or conceptualization of the game; it simply didn't hold my attention or give me a sufficient dose of fun factor, as I thought it would before I bought it. Maybe that's mainly because I played it solo and this is the type of game that would simply be more fun played head-to-head.

Can be played solitaire, and since "Aliens" hasn't been reprinted by somebody, I thought this may have scratched that itch for me, as I love the theme. Even though there are only about 6 pages of rules here, there is a lot to keep in mind, so one can reasonably expect to retain rules through repeated play. The learning scenario, though very simple, is effective at giving players a feel for the basics of movement, combat, Xeno reproduction. 

Purchased new, December 2010. Sold December 2011.

I made my own PNP. Not a pimped out version...but I did have to come up with most of the cards, so while I was at it I created a bunch of new Xeno units, too. Would be happy to send or upload the files for the cards I made (not many) and the new Xenos (including Plaguelings, Queens, Spinecrawlers, Infested Marines, and a Defiler-like unit).

I’m a sucker for these types of space combat games and Forlorn Hope is no exception.  This one is very simple and straightforward and is very easy to solo.  It really doesn’t have a lot of tactical depth, but it does have an interesting story and some of the missions are fairly intriguing.

I liked the rules but my son was turned off by the components.  Once we had some games with miniatures I couldn't get him interested in it.

It does have a few solo scenarios but once  I was able to get Space Hulk for a reasonable price I couldn't see keeping two  games that cover the same ground.

I think that playing the aliens in Forlorn: Hope is more fun than being the genestealers in Space Hulk...you have more options.

Neat game.  Everybody wants to play Aliens versus Space Marines, don't they?  Easy to learn, fun, and tense.  Victory Point Games was clever in making this both a solitaire and two-player game.  The quality is pretty much a high-scale print-and-play style baggie game, but the price is a boxed-game price.  You be the judge of whether it's worth it.  The game is excellent, and although I" like it a lot, due to the price vs. components  quality ratio, I'm of mixed feelings about whether it was a good value or not.

Solid bug hunt game that includes both two player and solo variants.   Gameplay is straight forward with the human player determining how many actions they get then taking up to that amount of moves/special actions/firing.  Next the Xenos move/attack.

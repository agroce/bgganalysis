GAME: Burger Up
RANK: 2568
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Burger Up has an amazing theme, cute domino-like doublesided cards, nice aesthetic, great graphic design and...a huge glaring strategic problem.

The First-Order-Optimal Strategy in this game is to build a Colossal size burger as fast as possible. Why? Let me explain. You get 4 cards a turn and can only play 3. But when you build a Colossal (10+ cards), you can either upgrade your restaurant, giving you +1 card to PLAY each turn or just gain +10 coins. You should ALWAYS
ALWAYS
ALWAYS
ALWAYS
ALWAYS
Do this. Your first burger should, I repeat, ALWAYS be a Colossal sized and upgrade your restaurant. If there are 30 turns in a 2P game, which is how I'm reviewing this, then that's +26 cards you got to play assuming you get the Colossal as soon as physically possible.

Getting to play that many extra cards is FUCKING INSANE. That's basically 2 Colossals and an extra Tower almost every game (25 pts ignoring Perfect ingredients and Top Bun bonus).

Any player who completes this alone will instantly alert everyone that there's an arms-race for another Colossal. The problem is that they now have the initiative to be halfway done with ANOTHER Colossal size burger. Those are large enough to meet almost any requirement, so Top Buns don't really stop you here. If they just keep making speedy small burgers, then you can now make Gourmet sized every single turn, remember you're laying 4 each turn. You always have the advantage.

This is a Prisoner's Dilemma. No player wants to have to upgrade their restaurant instantly because it bogs the game down into a boring grind-fest of huge burgers. But everyone has to immediately because the ugpraded restaurant strictly dominates all other strategies. Thus, Prisoner's Dilemma.

This is going to be the entirety of my review because it's the most major aspect of the entire game: scoring burgers. And it's completely broken. In the sense that now that everyone is building Colossal, it's just about pure luck as to who gets them first and with how many coins.

Also the +5 points from scoring more Top Buns is super deceptive: you will almost never get that even if you try to speed through burgers, due to the way the final turns work. Not only that but +5 points is a tiny amount and shows the designers had no idea how gamebreaking the colossal strategy was.


SOME MORE DOWNSIDES:

-Once a player pulls ahead, you can NEVER overtake them. They're ahead for eternity unless they do something extremely boneheaded.
-Getting a little bit more luck in this game than your opponent means you straight up win. This is mostly manifest in terms of drawing more perfect ingredients. Since perfect ingredients are zero-sum (you deny them one just by having it, and gain an extra if you actually use it), they essentially count as +2 score for each played (using relative terms).
-Scoring a burger makes your opponent's burgers BETTER, so the First Player can't afford to ever score less than the highest Top Bun available. Otherwise, the opponent will dramatically overtake their score with zero ability to come back. MAJOR problem.


IN SUMMARY:

+Great visuals
+High quality components (even if the money is uninspired)
+Fun light theme
-First Order Optimal Prisoner's Dilemma strategy. Ouch.
-Perfect ingredients cause very luck-based results
-No catchup mechanics to offset the previous two problems.
-First player disadvantage

The game is way too long to have an overtake problem. You see it happen and no matter how perfectly you play, you now have to sit there for 45+ minutes knowing you will have less points at the end. It seriously needs a rule change to prevent the Colossal problem and a catchup mechanic added.

(I haven't tried any of the variants on the site. The game should stand by its box-shipped merits)

A very unique game that makes you laugh at the abomination of a "burger" you just started selling. I love to imagine that your restaurants are the only ones in a town full of disdainful individuals, with children moaning "Why do I have to eat the Kids Burger that is just Bacon, Middle Bun, Swiss? How is this even a burger?" It's just so great.

Played at Go-Lounge in Brisbane.

My son loved it, I though it wasn't a bad pattern making game.  Maybe a little long (but that could be because there was an expansion mixed in, fattening up the "Burger Top" deck.

I'll be on the look out for a copy!

What to say about Burger Up... A game about building hamburgers and completing orders. You need to be quick though as your opponents are trying to complete the same orders before you and you could be left with a burger no one wants. This was a decent game, but it was long for its depth.

Very good production quality. Fairly fun but somewhat prone to analysis paralysis.

Pros
* Nice linen cards
* Really good art
* Box has expansion slots but is not overly large
* Well-written manual

Cons
* First player has always lost in every game we've played (dramatically) - don't know if this is luck or a game flaw?
* Game is a tad long - our shortest (with 2 players) was 80 minutes - nowhere near the 45 minutes on the box. It would be nice if the burger levels were shorter by a card or two.
* Box cover was a little too snug
* Could have used less 10 chips and more 1 chips

The novelty of the game is great, and I've been able to pull in family to play this game rather easily. The game is a straightforward set collecting game but it looks great and you definitely laugh at some of the ridiculous burgers you can create.

Too much unneccessary steps which prolong the game

RATING: 6
The ingredient mechanic here is really quite nice, each ingrediant card has two orientations and a requirement for what type of ingrediant MUST be placed on top, so you really must carefully consider what is in your hand, the order in which you play them and which customer order you are hoping to fulfil.

Some customers orders require burgers of a certain size i.e a gourmet burger has 4-6 ingredients whilst some stipulate no meat or no mayo
Money is quite tight and you cannot afford to actually buy many of the ingrediants on the display, so especially after this first game it feels like a lot of luck of the draw, but overall it is a nice longish filler game that is simple to pick up and play.

This is a 2-4 player card building game.  My kids 9 & 11 years old keep asking to play this with me.  We love it as it is a game of chance, planning, order, and it has fantastic illustrations too!  We play with the 'Burgers of the World' ingredients but only the '2 BOTW ingredient' top bun with the rest of the top buns that have to be fulfilled. We have won the game each once, my son won twice, and we it's easy to learn and teach.

I'm a sucker for food themed game and great artwork. The artwork and graphic design in this game is outstanding in my opinion. Card quality is great. Tho the price point of this game is bit steep for what you are getting.

The game is a fun set collection and card/tile placement. Luck plays some factor tho it is mainly about planning ahead with consideration of what set is other players going for. 

Played with 3 and it worked very well.

I like this game. Got GB to play it with me. Probably would've enjoyed it more had she not rushed me through my turns (I guess I AM prone to AP after all, but in my defence, it's those two-sided cards that get to me and I'm old). The burger names are funny and the art is vibrant and fun. Super simple mechanic and loads of choices. Played unwittingly with the Burgers of the World expansion and was stymied at first by the globetrotting ingredients. Will have to read the expansion rules later...

I hope more people choose to vote on BGG for how each player account works with this game. Our first game was 4 players and it was not a good fit. Too much downtime and we went through the ingredient deck two often due to building lots of tower or colossal burgers. I suspect this would be much better for 2 or 3 players.

The burger stacking mechanic is really unique with the way you place the cards and takes some getting used to. This game is great fun but seems to last a little too long with the default rules so we usually take out some extra recipe cards. In the end it's usually pretty close, which is alwys exciting.

A simple and fun little game.

It has a nice little puzzle element where the first card you play dictates what the next card has to be.

the component quality top notch and the art is solid 

The only downsides are its a little dependent on luck of the draw and if you spend all your coins on ingredients and someone else finishs the order it can be hard to catch up

I like the idea of building your own burgers and the game is fun but I think it drags out a little too long. You can fix this though by reducing the amount of burgers in the deck but this does cause problems with points scoring because the game is already too tight with the amount of available points on the table and this will further reduce the need to flip your bun. Components are great and the burgers look good, I always crave a burger after this game!

I jumped right onto a first order optimal strategy in my first game, It basically caused the other players to have to do the same or lose. The players that just couldn't make it happen lost because of it and no one had fun. The Colossus burger is the ONLY strategy in the game. I made one on turn 4 flipped my restaurant and never looked back ending the game with 95 points, pumping out a tower every other turn or if I was blocked turning that into a Colossus. The 95 was taking into account just buying and dumping trade row cards to artificially inflate my hand, or just to get a better shot at the card I needed right at that moment. I could have broken 100 if I had played a little tighter.

If you can't make a colossus by turn 4-5 you WILL lose this game, every time NO fail. there's no way for someone with out a flipped restaurant to combat a flipped one. and every turn that you go without is one more turn that your opponent gets +1 card/ +1 play. It just builds up against you like a mountain that you cant overcome.

I liked this game but unfortunately I can't give it a good score as it is solved and therefor no fun, and i can't play again. hopefully the expansion fixes this but if all it dose is add more burger tops it will only compound the problem.

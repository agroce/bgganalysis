Some interesting mechanics and it manages to recreate the historical campaign pretty well.

However, Case Yellow is also a fairly typical Raicer affair in its oppressive scripting. Even the variant scenarios play out in similar ways, the Germans always trash the allied armies in short order and seize France with the only question being whether they can make up the VP deficit.

In three plays (scenario one and two) it seemed abundantly clear that competent German play will prevent the allies from ever mounting a particularly meaningful defense, nor did any of those games see any viable oppurtunities for the allies to counterattack.

Maybe its better solitaire as then one can smash, stomp and run wild with the Germans to one's heart's content.

I thought I was getting a rehash / reprint of the old "France 1940" but was I surprised. This game combines very flavorful and varied rules, well-proportioned counter mix, highly functional map and graphics. The game is sized so that all the special rules and situations have game impact rather than being distractions.

The historical scenario is ideal for solitaire play as both sides are to one extent or another bound by the decisions, good and otherwise, of the historical commanders. Two additional what-ifs are more game-able, and a small intro one-turn Holland scenario complete to package.

We found that we could easily play a game turn in under an hour (except perhaps the first turn, which took more preparation), so the full 10 turns is easily completed in two gaming sessions. Very enjoyable and engaging.

Loved the included mini game (played it several times) and the components look very nice. I played through the game twice and wanted to like it, but I could never master the movement rules (and their exceptions) nor could I remember that I needed to trace two kinds of supply. Maybe I will give it another try someday.

Mark Simonitch now has done this campaign right with his France '40 game. There is absolutely no reason to play Case Yellow now that Simonitch's game is available.

Last comment, I think the well-done thing about Case Yellow is that the "historical" campaign is interesting to play. Yes, the French are going to lose Paris, but there is a lot of variability in how it plays out, a fair amount of interest to the operational details, and the Germans are under a huge amount of time and efficiency pressure to get the job done. If the Allies can do a decent job of dinging the German panzers, making the coastal pocket more troublesome, and generally forming up a second line, the Germans are going to be under the gun. So while the historical outcome isn't in doubt, the results of the game - in terms of counting VPs - maintain a lot of tension. Which is good. I am actually less interested in the variant scenarios, just because they look like they'd take longer to play, and Case Yellow already overstays its welcome.
---
After a couple plays of scenario 1, my opinion has solidified. This is a traditional Raicer game: clever, with a very nice historical feel, and far too long for what you get out of it. I like how the chit picks work, the ZOC-negating and force-focussing powers of the German mobile units work great, and the crossing seizure rules are a nice thematic touch. But even scenario 1, which appears to be the fastest-playing one, will be hard-pressed to come in at under 8 hours, even with familiarity. There is just too much micromanagement, and too much can go wrong if you fail to advance that one extra hex in a timely manner. I think opportunities were missed here for playable, somewhat shorter scenarios that would have added a lot of interest. It seems that for scenario 1 at least, a turn or two could easily have been trimmed from both the beginning and the end: conquering The Netherlands and Belgium and traffic control in the Ardennes is not compelling gaming, and neither I imagine is the race for the board edge after shattering the last defensive line.

Anyway, for me a near miss, but the typically extravagant playing time definitely makes it a miss. I've heard rumors Mark Simonitch is making a game on this topic, Case Yellow has whetted my appetite for that game, but I don't have much desire to play this one again.
---
Played once. It has the traditional annoying features of Raicer games: crucial special rules that are easy to forget and lack clear reminders, and excessive playing time. Budget at least 5-6 hours for your first game of scenario 1, and the big one - scenario 3, with a lot more maneuver capability and propensity to get into a slugging match - looks to me like it could be a time sink.

Still, a lot of good stuff on display here, and it manages a nice balance between having a good historical feel and remaining a playable, interesting game. Yes, the Allies are going to get clobbered in the historical scenario, but there is interest in how it plays out - can the Allies manage to cut and run in time from Belgium and can the Germans tighten the noose, and then can the French re-form a plausible defense line. The outcome is inevitable, but the journey is interesting. Nobody would mistake this for a Simonitch game, but it's still pretty clean-playing. The chit-draw system isn't entirely satisfactory in some ways and can be very swingy for the Allies, but this particular flavor of it works as well here as anywhere I thought.

The long-term viability of the game will come down entirely to playing time, I think. If it can be finished in the 3-4 hours sort-of advertised (I notice GMT has put no time estimate on the box), I think it'll be an interesting addition to my collection. But I am dubious that this is at all reasonable. I suspect the actual playtime will be 6+ for most folks. Which I think will be much too long.

Rating based on a partial learning game of the historical campaign scenario.

Very good (and not so difficult) system which highlights the particularities of this campaign (efficiency of armored divisions, attrition, bridgeheads across the rivers, as the Meuse, et cetera).

RATING: 7
Many good concepts go along with this game: chit activation (no perfect planning), random mechanical breakdowns of motorised units, ...
Nevertheless there are too many special rules for my taste, which just help to reproduce the historical results (e. g. a chapter on two poor french cavalry divisions in the Ardennes - they'll die regardless of this chapter).
Definitely "the" game if you want to get a feeling for the problems and the course of the Westfeldzug. But I do not want to play the historical scenario with two players, the allied one has too few to do.

RATING: 6
Some interesting ideas here, and the right scale for a playable France '40 game, but Case Yellow has absolutely the slowest playing impulse system I've seen yet. When you draw a chit, your entire army is activated - but only for movement OR combat. So, every impulse you're fiddling with your whole front - which is pretty time consuming - but any type of movement to contact requires multiple impulses. Admittedly, impulse systems usually take longer to play than IGO HUGO, but this is the worst of both worlds.

[b]Case Yellow, 1940: The German Blitzkrieg in the West

A Little Gem on a Fascinating Campaign.[/b]

Case Yellow has one problem: If it is to be a good simulation of the German invasion of France and the Lowlands, it has to be a pain to play for the Allied player. Many of the reasons why the Allies suffered such a catastrophic defeat are rooted in the higher HQ level, which is represented by the players themselves. Thus, the Allied player would either have to play stupid, or be forced to do things he wouldn't do. Ted Raicer went with the latter, and scripted much of the initial Allied deployment. Accordingly, the historical scenario is more of a case study, the more and more ahistorical scenarios #2 and #3 are nailbiters, most enjoyable for both players.
The system itself is fantastic. The soft handling of ZOCs with emphasis on mobile and elite formations does a great job at recreating the deployment of Blitzkrieg tactics, while attack supply and armor attrition constantly endanger the vulnerable exploiting forces. The air support rules work well in highlighting the different doctrines that commanded German Close Ground Support and the more operational/strategic thinking of the Allies.
I feel, though, that I should mention the following: This was my first hex&counter game, so I might be extra sentimental in my opinion!

Pretty good treatment of the campaign in the West.  Like many "France 1940" games their are idiocy rules for the Allies; at least for the historical scenario.  There are other versions that give the Allied player more flexibility, and a Holland scenario as an introductory/quick play game. Yes, there's some unique rules like units ignoring SOME ZOCs, and a lot of writing about river crossing/bridgeheads. Personally I like an innovative system-and this is, chit pulls and for the first time I've seen a representation of the logistics/maintenance issues the Germans had.
If you want something different, challenging instead of the same old add-up-the-factors type game try this.

Arrived 13/7. Simulates operation "Fall Gelb" in a very playable way. Chit pulling and the announcement of operation "Dynamo" or operation "Fall Rot" makes the turn order unpredictable and adds to the tension of the game. The better equipped, trained and led German army will destroy the Allies rather quickly but operating out of supply and having to run against time makes playing both sides interesting. Two "what if" scenarios add to the replayability of "Case Yellow". The game components are of the high, GMT quality. 

Case Yellow includes the Dutch army! At last....

A very unique "Beer & Pretzel" game that tackles the "Dyle Plan" very well, has several what-if scenarios, and small dinner plate sized scenario that explores the German Fallschirmjaeger assaults. Coordination of forces and bridgeheads, Refugees getting in the way and much more make this game challenging fun. Well written rules, great maps and counters only make the game that much more of a joy to play. A game I highly recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

Have always been interested in the planning and execution of Fall Gelb.

Another Ted Racier pre-programmed game. As usual he has marked areas on the map that you have to move to no matter what on assigned turns rather than composing victory conditions that may give incentive for the historical thought of actions.

Operation Dynamo can only be played on two different turns no matter what the situation may be.

These are a couple of examples of yet another game that showed promise but in practice was tedious.

I think he may a bit OCD about recreating every historical event.

For an exciting game try Mark Simonitch's France '40 instead.

RATING: 8
The WW2 French Campaign.  I have always been looking for a playable simulation of the campaign.  With Ted's medicore designing quality like Grand Illusion or uneven quality like Stalin's War before, he is my personal disappointment with my expectations towards his games.  With credit like Paths of Glory, one of the best wargame designed ever regarded by the general, I tend to have high hope with his games.  However, many times I feel they were over-hyped.  With a traditional WW2 subject matter like Case Yellow, I am hoping this is the best game on the campaign in my book.  Let's see if it delivers its own promises...if this game is sufficiently tested before release.  

Ted Racier develops a rather intricate and delicate units and Attack Supply system, i.e. in addition to the normal supply rule, units are required to check for Attack Supply at the instant of combat. Motorized and panzer units have relatively more freedom in attack and movement than the infantry, as they retained much WWI operational planning and doctrine, as the designer says.  For example, they can ignore enemy ZOCs for movement and retreat if all the adjacent enemy units have lower Tactical Rating by comparison (TR check).  When they are forced to retreat through enemy ZOC, similarly, a TR check would determine who is allowed through.

Mucho chrome, y a riesgo de ser bastante dirigido en el sentido histórico tiene un " gran sabor ".

RATING: 5.8
A bit of a disappointment. We played Scenario #2, Variant #1, and I'm really not sure what Raicer was going for here. The game seems like it would be a perfect low-complexity, introductory boardgame about the fall of France. Instead, it's over-long, fiddly, and far more complex than the box indicates. And a lot of the fiddliness is due to rules being shoehorned into the game to show how Holland, Belgium, and Denmark fell so precipitously, but it wasn't even very educational. As the Allied player in Scenario 2, I had precious little to do as the Huns swept all before them. 

I don't know. Maybe this should have been a low-complexity What If? game from the start. I really don't know if I have it in me to dredge through the VP tables, or Supply Attack rules or Dynamo again.

Not a horrible game if you want to recreate or learn more about this battle but not terribly exciting.

Because the Allied have to follow to Dyle plan, the game is mostly a solo exercise with very little replay value or meaningful decisions. The problem is that it is not simply one but actually both sides that are put in a historical straitjacket. It is heavily scripted and in practice it forces you to follow a very narrow course of action so the game almost plays itself. On a strategic level, the game is basically on rails and it is designed in such a way that there isn't a whole lot of micromanagement to do either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Rating of a 5 if you play the historical scenario.  Only play this just to see what happened in history.  Beyond that, it has little pull for replayability.

The ahistorical scenarios make this more of a fight.

System seems pretty solid.  There is some chrome, but most of it is to get the historical campaign rolling along the historical lines.  Plays very quickly with the chit system doing a pretty decent job of recreating the less than efficient C&C systems fighting one another.  Armor attrition is a nice add on that captures the burn out of both armored forces.

RATING: 7
It’s more of a simulation than a game - that’s good and bad. It’s not hard to understand that the allied planning in 1940 was worse than bad. The central position that the German army will achieve is extremely strong. The draw of the initiative counter is very critical to the game outcome.

RATING: 8
A well done portrayal of the 1940 Campaign.
Some things I like - the chit draws providing variability each turn with the Germans have more flexibility. The armored/motorized units are very powerful they are your main striking forces, but begin to bleed away pretty quickly. 
There is a lot of special rules - expect to be referring to the rule book. Most have an dramatic impact on the flow of the game. 

The historical scenario is difficult and is best solitaire as an historical study. The Allies are hamstrung, but I like the way the Dyle plan and the Ardennes was set up in the rules. The Panzer refit and the Case Red requirements to complete the Fall of France helps capture the dilemma facing the Germans keep pushing to bag the northern armies and perhaps not have the strength to finish the job, or refit for the next phase.
For 2 player the other scenarios are better. I'd like to try Plan E where the allies only advance a bit into Belgium to hold the coast.

Good for History accuracy lovers. Too many small details to remember in order to follow every Historical event. Interesting what if situations. Not the best Ted Raicer´s game but it is a standard high quality GMT game so it is a good investment. Some strategic siuations are really appealling. Supply planning, rivers and forest effects on movement and using armored units are some of them. It is a good game but not for my tastes.

Have played historical scenario. Works well for solo play - chit pull gives randomness and Allied movement requirements allow for some opponent A.I play - always helpful for solo. T.R ratings give nuances to armour breakthroughs. 

Given the historical success of the actual German attack and invasion the game's victory point allocation are set high for the Germans - must be double that of Allies (in historical scenario) - therefore quite tough for German 'win' - even with Paris conquered and fractured French lines and losses.

Decent and enjoyable game.

The swift German victory in France in 1940 is a difficult situation to simulate and this game does not succeed.  After three playings it does not appear to me to be even remotely possible for the German player to accomplish what was done historically - to reach the English channel in essentially three player turns.  The main issue for me is the counter density which allows the French player to create a continuous line that the German player cannot break through swiftly despite his advantages in armor and ZOC penetration.  I especially did not like the armor attrition rule which is tedious and unnecessary (why not just factor it into the combat results to streamline play) and also further inhibits the German player from having any chance to accomplish his blitzkrieg. Although physical components were attractive and pleasing to the eye, the game fails in its attempt to recreate the German blitzkrieg,  resulting in a game more like 1914 than 1940.

This is a very clever design, with a great and elegant chit-pull mechanism at its heart. Its usage of ZOC is very smart. The Tactical Efficiency factor is also very elegant. There's a lot to like about this game, which really comes alive when Operation Dynamo commences.

I don't think the game is overly complex or fiddily, but the way the rules are organized makes it appear that way-- I searched in vain for a couple pieces of information in the rule and play books, only to find it on one of the player aids. It makes it difficult to look up the special rules or exceptions and easy to misplay, which discourages getting it on the table.

Punched & played but in good condition, for trade with counter tray included.

played once so far, passable effort to learn but the rules are fiddly enough and the play is different enough from what I'm used to that it will take a few more times to nail down a strong feel.

But that could be overcome in good play by the French player I think. It appears pretty solid fun to me.

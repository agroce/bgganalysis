121124 Simple dice rolling / speed recognition game.  Only played 2P, and it most likely should be played with more.  Not half bad actually, now that I think about it.

Juego frenético muy divertido!, para chavales jóvenes y no tan jóvenes xD Consiste en memorizar lo antes posible símbolos en dados, para representar con ellos fórmulas con los símbolos en cartitas, que te permiten avanzar en una carrera de brujas en escoba, si consigues recordar parte o todos los símbolos sin añadir ninguno equivocado. Si consigues recordar todos los símbolos naranjas o negros obtienes además un bonus. La presentación y su forma de jugar en su caja-libro con cierre metálico, es de lo más original y visualmente más bonito de lo que se ha editado!

I enjoy puzzle games and this is close enough (with its "quick memory" aspect) and different enough for me to like it. And if you don't like it, the game is over pretty quickly. I also think people are generally better at this than they think they'll be.

FANTASTIC production, the box and component art is fun and terrific.  The game itself is nifty and entertaining.  It's just not a HUGE amount of strategy, but I do see it getting a fair amount of play in my household.

{1 play, 5 players} I wanted to like it more, as there's some cool stuff going on here - and the bits are quite nifty, but it's just left me wanting at the end.  The ability to hinder the better action/memory players is nice, but the chaos of the cards can still screw you if you're behind.  Also, the scoring track was a bit confusing (but I like the loopiness of it).  I'd play it again, though, just to see... and maybe my rating would go up.

C-- was predisposed to hate this game, but I soldiered on, determined to at least give it a try. Finally everyone got the hang of it and we were off. Despite the fact I was way ahead for the first half, and finished first, J-- won and C-- was right behind us. Dang ol' acrobatics cards.

A victory! C-- said she would play again.

Has turned out to be an improbable hit with everyone I've introduced it to. I underestimated the game!

This is a kid's game that can be played and enjoyed by adults as well.  It is a nice memory game that requires quick recognition and recall.  Good brain exercise and it plays fast as well.  Afterall, it is a race game.  If your really bad at memory and recognition you may have trouble, but even those not overly skilled can opt to take a less risky path which, while slower moving can advance you.  This option keeps all players in the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A really innovative racing game which uses the players' abilities of fast paced memory retention to remember and eliminate icons from a rolled dice pool. The bigger the spells you can remember (after mentally eliminating duplicate die icons), the further along you can move, and if you get something wrong you are moved back. So you've got memory and dexterity at work, plus there are reward cards that can further alter the game. I can see that this would prove frustrating to some players who don't like that, but with lovely artwork and a fun theme I have no choice but to admire it for what it is.

It's light fun, and quite enjoyable. The cards seem to be the only way to add any depth to this but, during our play at least, it seemed difficult to get any as the only person who was matching a whole set of dice was in the lead and hence prohibited from collecting cards.

Could be just a simple race game but the movement mechanic is excellent. You have to be able to review, analyse, discard and remember the results of a host of dice rolls accurately and quickly. Often you are balancing playing the few symbols you are sure of for a certain move forward or taking a chance on going for more - risking a bonus for getting the full set or losing the move for playing something wrong. However, as speed of analysis and memory are key deciding factors you need to play with people of similar abilities. Not one for a mixed group of kids.

This is actually a pretty fun and well-designed game, suitable for kids and adults, but two core mechanics kill it for me: memory and real-time deduction. I am terrible at both of these, and no matter how much practice I have, I never seem to get any better at them. As such, this is not my type of game.

If you like games like Geistesblitz or Set, you will probably love this.

Enjoyable game of quickly deducing and remembering formulas.  Unfortunately that skill varies in people and some will be completely put off by the game because of it.  It is somewhat easy to handicap players to even out the skill level though, which is nice because my kids enjoy the game but are not quick enough (yet) to compete with adults.

When I saw this game was a combination of speed and memory, I totally wrote it off, as I hate these two genres.  However, I was very surprised to see I didn't hate the game, and actually liked it a little bit!

The speed portion of the game is actually more to do with how fast you are at the pattern recognition.  And the memory game is simply being able to remember the pattern for about 2 seconds as you play the correct cards, so the memory element is almost nonexistent.

Overall, just a plain cool game of pattern recognition that I think would be fun to pull out once in a while.

Highly original visual memory game. Nice bookcase design for rolling dice and holding components. Being in the lead (and therefore being cursed) has some serious disadvantages so trailing the leader nearing the end is probably an effective tactic. It's amazing how quickly I can forget everything I was just looking at. Definitely not one of my strengths!

While I have enjoyed this game, I think it has a deep and unavoidable flaw -- the skill required to do well in this game (memorizing dice faces quickly) will vary and, to some extent, can be learned.  As a result, it is really unbalanced both between experienced and inexperienced players (based on experience level) and also between people of similar experience levels (based on innate ability).

RATING: 2
I'm too lazy to read the rules to games before I buy them, instead relying on ratings from geekbuddies and to a lesser extent the general BGG population. But sometimes I ignore that when a game is like 80% off. This game is a reminder of why 80% off is still too expensive. And that's just from reading the rules. This is going straight to the give-away pile (since clearly no one will buy it).

Components: The board score track is very difficult to follow, with all its bends and double-backs.  The dice are a mishmash of images that make it very difficult to recognize symbols, but I suppose that's the point. Still, I think I would enjoy the game more if there were symbols that I could more easily articulate to myself (e.g. I don't have a word to describe the difference between the two lightning bolts).

Experience: Very frenetic.  I don't think I've ever played a game like this, combining memory with speed, with pattern recognition.  Players have mere seconds to decide on a color and eliminate or confirm a few ingredients.  The 'curse' rule seems like a good balancing feature.

When played with two fixes - the closer must get a full set or he gets nothing, and a failed box closer cannot close the box the next turn - the game really shines.  People have enough time to look for whole sets, and the special powers come into play a lot more.  What elevates this game above a lot of other speed recognition games is that you can still get something even if you aren't the fastest on a given turn.  It's not all or nothing.  Very nice.

Very enjoyable memo-game that looks childish at first, but reveals itself as deeply tactical. We went from trying to get perfect formulas, to just trying to get 1 or 2 cards correct and closing the lid as fast as possible. The symbols are fiendish, they confused in my brain, I kept thinking spider but was that the spider or the spider-web, which flash was it, very very muddling. Very high quality graphic design on the cards, poor design on the board and a simple amazing box shaped like a book with a rounded spine. Stunning production, but I'm bothered that they put a set of replacement symbol stickers in the game as is, they must really expect the symbols to wear off.

This fast observation game is very well done and plays smoothly. It is fun and exciting and you risk playing that one standing up. I am not fond of some of the action cards. Although they throw in some needed chaos and leader equalization, some of them are hard to understand and complexify the game by requiring the players to play in a specific order. This is just too bad because it hurts the game a lot.

Production-wise, the box is very nice but you really have to ask yourself what was the point of making all these twists in the score track. If the goal was to make it unreadable, mission accomplished!

Simply not our style of game... dice rolling with a unique form of memorization. I can appreciate the packaging and even the concept but the game doesn't call to me. I do like being able to issue handicaps to adults and a headstart for younger players... but just try explaining this game to young kids... groan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game that relies entirely on the players' pattern recognition skills. A number of symbol dice is throw each turn that according to certain rules makes up a spell (or two). The players try to recognize and memorize that spell as quickly as possible. The witch who thinks she has figured it out closes the dice tray, thereby preventing anyone from looking at the formula any more. Now the players must reproduce the spell with cards from their hand, and then score points according to how well (or not) they fared.

Strangely enough, this is a game that prominently features both a memory component and real-time play, both elements that I normally detest, yet I don't mind them here. The game makes for a nice filler, although it may be better for warming up than for winding down since it can get a little exhausting due to the time-triggered memory scheme.

This is a fun game with a creative presentation. It's a simple racing game with the twist that in order to advance on the victory track, you have to identify spells on the rolled dice by remembering which symbols are not repeated on both the orange and the black. Whoever thinks they have successfully identified a valid spell closes the book so no one can see the dice. At that point everyone has to lay down the cards to show the spells they found. It's not as easy as it sounds. So it's one part racing game, one part memory game. It's enjoyable and would be a good one for the kids. It's not something I'll be compelled to play on a regular basis, but I wouldn't mind playing it with the kids for the fun of it.

Very simple race game, but with a really unique and thematic movement mechanic that involves rolling dice to determine the proper 'magic formula' that will move you forward (and then having to execute the formula correctly without being able to look at the dice). Despite a significant shared aversion to speed based mechanics, my wife and I both really enjoy this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Looking at the rolled dice and trying to memorize them as quickly as possible is fun and done well. The faces on the dice have similar image connotations, so you are forced to uniquely identify each image when frantically noting the roll. Travelling the entire length of the board, however, makes the game outstay its welcome by a few turns. We also noticed that no one wanted to be the "dice roller," because of the disadvantage it creates in dividing your attention between memorizing and rolling.

I'm not that good with memory games, but this one has a rich theme and is quick and fun enough for family enjoyment.  Good idea to include the stickers, as we got one dark wood coloured die that is a bit hard to see.  We will likely use the stickers.

I tend not to like games where you HAVE to act quickly.  And I don't like memory games.  But there is something about this game that makes it a lot of fun.

I'm against house rules normally.  But, we do play that the person that closes the book has to at least try to make a spell.

Best speed game I've played so far.  Provides enough ability to slow down the leader, which is needed in games like this where one person may just be faster than the others.  Adds some strategy in chosing which colors to go for, and holding yourself back to stay out of the lead.  Very fun, nice production.

[Initial Impression: 7]
A quick and easy race game where you have to balance speed and accuracy. Players roll a set of dice and quickly look for valid formulas among the dice (they come in two flavors), until someone slams down the book cover to hide the dice. Then everyone tries to reproduce a valid formula in order to advance and, hopefully, earn a bonus. Slam down the book cover too quickly, and you'll be penalized if you get a wrong answer, but if you're quick enough to find at least one valid die, you can keep others from advancing by moving fast. There is a curse that prevents the leader from earning the bonuses, so moving fast when you're in the leading position can be a good thing (I've even seen people purposefully take the penalty in order to lose the leader's position). Cards (earned through a bonus action) can alter play in a variety of ways, but the best cards give you bonus points at the end of the game. Probably best without a full complement of players, but it is good group fun. Because of the perceptual speed element (a la Set), not a game to play when you're tired and bleary-eyed. One of the best things about the game is the lovely packaging, which doubles as a play area. You'll also be obligated to wonder about that red witch...

First played September 20th, 2007.  This was a quick learn (<5min) and quick play (~20min) for 5 players.  The number of players doesn't impact time of play so it's a great 6 player game.  With the time, it's a great filler game.  The box is very cool.  Each witch has a set of 9 unique cards with symbols on them.  You roll 9 dice which have 9 type of matching symbols on them (they can be duplicated) in two colors (multiple of each color as well).  Matches (one or more symbols of both colors) are considered invalid spells.  Everyone looks at the dice rolled and determines what "spell" they are going to cast.  The idea is to get the most symbols to make up your spell of one of the two colors without playing an invalid symbol.  If you get all of black, you get a special card which can help you out in different situations.  If you get all of the red then you move forward two extra spaces.  Each correct spell moves you forward one space for every sybmol in your spell.  It's load of fun and I would recommend giving this some game play, consideration for purchase and consideration in keeping in your stash of games to play on a regular basis.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (July 2012)

What a surprise game. I was going to sell my copy in shrink when a friend brought this to our game nights and I’m glad he did. It is a very light game but with novel mechanics (memory and pattern recognition under pressure GREAT) and short play time. I had lots of fun playing this and it is perfect to introduce new gamers to our hobby or to play with the family. 

The game components are great, although I have heard the dice peel off rather easy (a huge minus for me). The game box is very well designed and very beautiful too. The gameplay is great (and quick) and (important for me) the best player will usually win (although there are some random cards).

I’m downgrading its rating because I’m trying to unify all my ratings according to the BGG recommendation system. Wicked Witches Way is a game I would like to play from time to time, not every day so, for now, it is a 6.0.

Bottom line, a light game I really like. I reserve it for when I have new players at hand. I got it cheap from Tanga.  

Current Rating: 6.0

This one has a little merit just because it was so different than anything else I've played.  A decent filler every now and then...pick it up if you find a copy deeply discounted otherwise stick to Incan Gold, For Sale, No Thanks or one of the other highly rated fillers on the Geek.

Very decent for what it is - emphasis on the "for what it is".
It's a speed pattern recognition game which is very simple.  What I like about it is that, unlike other such games, everyone can score.  Usually, games like this just award the point to the first person to get the pattern - but here multiple people score, and it's possible to get points without getting the best pattern.  So there are multiple ways to play: high risk or slow and steady.  There is also a catch the leader mechanism.

But all that said - it's still just speed observation.

Very light and whimsical game.  The dice rolling/speed/memory element of the game is very unique.  Chanting out each spell is a must too, for maximum silliness.  I'm not sure there's too much room for good play, but the production is very nice - especially the "book of spells" in which you roll the dice.

Rating might go up once I've played with my kids, which is probably the target audience.  It's a little too simple with adults, and the catch-up/slow-down mechanic is a little annoying and unfair to the leader.  But it plays quickly and is unique.

Interesting twist on the memory game. This game is lots of laughs and great for non-gamers. In order to handicap those with better memories, this game incorporates some catch-up mechanisms which I find unnecessary (in particular the Malediction rule).

Great components, especially the box, which doubles as the dice tray. Note however that the Black Magic cards are in French.

Quick memory race game, where witches compete in a magical broom-flying contest.  Special dice covered in various symbols in two different colors are rolled.  Players attempt to memorize the pattern of one color, but anyone can close the "lid" when they think they have it.  Everyone then reconstructs the "formula" from memory.  It's simple, but the Black Magic cards add enough variety to keep it fun and interesting.

Theme will scare some people away with the witches theme and brewing spells.  As well, this game will work very well with anyone who has a great memory and can see patterns quickly before anyone else and shut the box.  Roll 10 dice, everyone studies the dice and quickly decides whether they memorize the orange or the black spell formula, first person to memorize slams shut the box, then everyone reveals the formula.  Not included in the formula are any ingredients that are the same for both the orange and the black spells.  If you are not in the lead, you can get a bonus for getting either spell completely correct.  Getting the black spell totally correct grants a black card which will grant extra victory points or special abilities.  Getting an orange spell totally correct grants you two extra movement points on the race track.

Juego de rapidez y memoria visual. Se lanzan los dados con los iconos de los hechizos y tan pronto se visualizan los componentes del hechizo se cierra el libro. Los jugadores escogen sus cartas y organizan los hechizos. Se revelan las cartas y se revisa las posiones. Aquellos que aciertan con los ingredientes de la posion, pueden avanzar tantos espacios en el tablero como el numero de aciertos de los ingredientes. Aquellos que aciertan en exacto numero de ingredientes de color naranja avanzaran 2 espacios extra y el que acierta los de color negro adquieren 2 cartas especiales.

If you do enjoy these types of games, this one is would make an awesome addition to your collection.

Found it very difficult to rate this game. On one hand it can be really fun and stressful to try and figure out which combinations are available, but on the other hand it can be very frustrating to play against opponents with a photographic memory (one player literally flipped the lid after two seconds and didn't miss a shot). Worst scoring track EVER. I like how some of the symbols are related (two lightining bolts, two spider thingies, etc.) which sometimes causes confusion in the memorization process. In the end, the game lasts a little too long for what it is.

Plain visual memory filler with a random element (cards) and a catch-up mechanism. 

The game is very repetitive: it's a race, but you do the same turn after turn, from the beginning to the end. I don't see this becoming a regular game for almost any group. Replayability would be a issue for me, I would get tired of it very soon.

The components are great except, maybe, the dice.

The game seems almost unfinished to me. It's just having a look at some dice results and trying to memorize it. I think adding some other elements would have improved the game.

I think the catch-up mechanic works very well and ensures a tight competition, but the cards with the points spoil the final result. In the game I played, the final result was determined by who had most cards with points. I crossed the end line first, but I had 0 card points and 2 other players overtook me with their cards (3-2 points).

It was nice to play a game, and I could agree to play it once every once and then if there's nothing else, but that's all.

Giochino con una scatola molto bella; utile in fase di gioco e carina da esporre riproducendo un libro; anche le dimensioni sono appropriate.

With all of that said; the [i]only[/i] complaint I have about this game is that it's a little bit too long. Games that rely heavily on the fun-factor shouldn't take more than about thirty minutes and with the scoringboard used in this game it can take over an hour.

A rare dice based game in which all players have an active interest in what is rolled: here there seems to be similarities from a different Bruno design "Bongo" in that from the dice rolled, all players speedily work out valid dice. In Witches Way another speed element is that a player can cover up the dice, causing some giggles and gnashing of teeth.

Nice trade off between the skill of remembering the dice symbols and the luck of playing the cards that quickly brings leaders and losers closer together.

This is a pretty cool mechanism and is executed well, if you ignore the extremely non-functional score track.

[b]Unique Component[/b] - The book/box is the biggest part of the game.


[b]Unique Mechanic[/b] - Basically the game is Memory.  But it is more like speed Memory with a twist in a race.  Players roll dice inside the book/box to produce random figures.  The book/box then becomes the biggest component as players can shut the book to make the players recall the figures.  


[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - Excellent fun and much harder then it sounds.

I found this to be pretty engaging.  Most gamers I know shy away from memory games, but this one mitigates pour memory play by adding chaos and speed to the equation.  Inevitably you will fight to memorize the symbols quicker as other players will play the safe play  (getting one or two of the Orange symbols correct.)
This makes getting a complicated black spell correct really rewarding.
Nice little race game that I will pick up if the price is right.

A pretty entertaining game of memory and speed. Not many people enjoy either element in games – let alone a combination of both – but I do. (I say this in spite of my laughably poor skills, so it has to count for something.) 

The dexterity aspect of deducing the spell symbols needed as quickly as possible and shutting the book ties up very neatly [i]as long as[/i] players don't shut the book purely to block others. (The house rule proposed by Scott Nicholson – that the player who shut the book must make at least one guess – helps mitigate this problem.)

There are two issues though. The first is that the racing aspect is a little drawn out, but that can be easily fixed by bringing the ending line forward by a few spaces. The second is that there are a few rules ambiguities in resolving endgame ties and the timing of special cards. In other words, this game needs quite a bit of house ruling (and the right crowd) to make it shine.

Wicked Witches Way is another variation on Memory, but a quite good one.

RATING: 7.561
This game is essentially a speed memory game that uses dice-rolling as the primary mechanic along with two sets of cards and a scoring track.  The game consists of rolling several six-sided dice in a spell book and closing the book.  Each player then uses a set of duplicate cards to remember the best "spell formula."  There is also another set of cards that are awarded to players that remember a formula that utilizes the dice with the black symbols.  Like many memory and speed games, this can feel more like a brain exercise than a game.  Fortunately, the game only has an advertised playing length of 30 minutes, but I think the game may actually play faster than that.  Some people won't like this type of game.  I probably won't want to play a lot of it in one setting, but everyone probably ought to try it at least once.  I think this game could appeal to both parents and their kids.  It might be a neat thing to have for a Halloween party or something like that.

It's a speed memory/pattern-recognition game. The box is very cool: looks like a spell book with one page that flips to cover either half of the book. You roll 9 dice marked with various combinations of weird symbols in either black or orange. Everyone looks to see what's there: like symbols in opposite colors cancel each other out. Someone flips the page and covers the dice, then everyone uses their play cards (9; 1 with each symbol) to indicate what they remember. Valid plays include any subset of either the orange dice or the black dice, using symbols that have NOT been cancelled out. If you're right, you advance on the score track. If you flipped the page and are wrong, you move backwards. There are bonuses for getting all orange symbols ( 2 points) or all black symbols (draw a bunch of cards and choose 1 to keep; these can be extra VP or special spells with various effects).

The game takes a while to get the hang of -- you mostly have to become familiar with the symbols (there are some similar ones, e.g., lightening and bolt in clouds; skull/crossbones and cross; spider and web) but you do improve with practice. A fun, quick game!

I strongly dislike pattern recognition games like Set! and Bongo, but actually quite liked this one. Unlike those other games, there's actual room for choices and tactical play here. So no, the players who are very proficient at true pattern recognition games may not always win here. For me a plus, for them probably a reason to prefer the drudgery of Set or Bongo.

[Asmodee 'Du Balai!' 2006 edition] {party, fantasy, racing; perception, dice-rolling, utility cards} Du Balai! is a nicely produced game! It's absolutely beautiful.

Game play is very fun. It has good player interaction, too. It's quite chaotic due to the magic cards. Players with the best perception skill may not win readily due to the handicap and leader-bashing (magic cards). It's especially fun for a group of similar skill players.

[New edition and new rule] It's good that the English version is available. Nevertheless, I am still happy with my French edition. I prefer the original French rule. The game becomes too casual if only the player who closed the book will move backwards.

A surprisingly charming little speed recognition game with frankly wonderful production values.

The cards are a little wonky, with one player scoring 8 hidden VPs in our play which took him from 4th to first, but that might just be sour grapes on my part (I was robbed!). The number of take-that cards is also perhaps too many for my tastes as it seemed to add about 20 minutes to the game, but it's still a game I enjoyed and one I'd play again, though perhaps I'd warn people about the value of the cards.

I love this game as a longish filler!  My quick description of it as a "photographic memory" game never really excites anyone, but once we get going it's a laugh-filled game every time.  The power cards are pretty variable, and a lot of them are designed to catch the leader.  In this game, that works well, since one player is usually just more skilled than the others.  That player really has to earn it.

I rather enjoy this game but at the same time I'm more than happy to see it come to an end when it does.  Usually one more round feels like it would be too much.  The game itself is not a lot of a game at all really.  Almost feels like it should be a small mechanic that gets worked into a bigger game this kind of thing get 'triggered' ever so often throughout the game.  This one mechanic over and over again while not boring would be if as I said it lasted any longer than it did.

Wicked Witches Way is like a cult classic made with a Hollywood budget. It's gorgeous to look at (even the box was lovingly designed), but you definitely need to be in a certain mood to enjoy it. The funny artwork disguises a memory-type game which requires quite a bit of concentration to play well. Therefore, the game is perfect as a filler while waiting for the last players to arrive, but not really suitable as a quick game to end the evening with. Fortunately, it can be explained quickly - I play it sometimes with my six year old son (without the special cards), and he enjoys it quite a bit.

Your goal? Win the race by passing the finish line first! Spot the dice, recreate the proper formula and advance... But don't forget that two kinds of combinations are possible, depending on the color: orange and its turbo mode, or black, with its special cards filled with spells and sneaky tricks! The choice is yours! Memory, audacity, and cunning will be your best assets to take the victory.

german edition. The hex tiles are just overproduced, a simple scoring track would be enough. As it is, the box is hard to close with all that stuff inside.

Very creative memory game. You roll 9 dice with various symbols in two colors (orange and black). Any that have a match on the orange and black dice are eliminated. In the end, you will have from 0 - 9 black symbols and 0-9 orange symbols left (usually a few for each side). Those form the 2 witches recipes. You then play cards from your hand to match the symbols on one recipe. But it is a speed game. The first person that wants to can shut the box. You then make your recipes from what you saw and remember. I really like it.

I suck at memory games. So how do you take a genre you're terrible at and make it worse? Add an element of speed -- forced speed dictated by your opponents... and visual recognition/acuity. Cute idea, but this simply does not work for me and the way I process information. An extra 1/2 point for the neat box that functions as an integral part of the gameplay. There are some neat concepts and ideas here, but I just can't play it well. I mostly want this cuz I think my kids would love it!

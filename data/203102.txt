What felt like another "run around a map and get played by the game" co-op.  While plenty thematic, it didn't feel like it offered anything new.  Lots of rules checking.  Meh.

RATING: N/A
Hmm.  Didn't really enjoy the way it snowballed quickly and overwhelmingly when I had played.   The character I picked seemed not so useful (Willow), as her special scaled with items, but inventory felt incredibly limiting.

Part of it was that our group all used our Specials on the final action of the round, which meant there were effectively 4 events that we could not respond to, and then we were at large risk of being overwhelmed.  That said, staggering specials was not very useful, because our specials revolved around defeating stuff.

Felt like the game had some good ideas, but the balance was a bit off and I didn't feel like it was that fun.

This is almost like a buffy version of Pandemic. There are some missing rule clarifications in the rulebook (can you do the same action twice in a round?) but the game itself is very enjoyable, if hard.
The box does really underestimate the playtime though. If you are playing solo, then you may be able to get this done in a hour. If you are playing with more players, then it will take several hours (both 3 player and 5 player games took 3 hours, as they were both with new people). Though some of this is likely due to trying to understand the nuances of the rules, as things like the combat system are rather different.
Would definitely recommend for a Buffy fan (many favourite characters are missing, like Faith, Oz, Cordelia, these may be in a future expansion) but as a game I would say it is great if you like cooperative games that are tough. Even playing solo with Buffy and Angel, with unlimited hand limits, I only just won the game. The normal hand limit (if solo) is 4.
One thing that is missing (big time) is a cheat card for the turn order, or to have this on the board (there is enough room on there for it). This would help massively towards first time players getting used to how to move monsters etc.

Might feel a little redundant if you've got multiple of the Pandemic games, however even as someone who is not a fan of the Buffy TV series, I had a good time with this. The villains can prove surprisingly thematic, occasionally silly, and the game does possess the right amount of tension for a co-op. Characters all have individual powers and there are a number of villains and sub-villains to mix it up and add a lot of replay value, before even an expansion is added.

Functionally, struck me as a slightly distilled version of Black Orchestra. Problem is, it distilled some of the things from BO that I like very much, i.e. Dice.   I also prefer the historical setting of BO, so I'd almost always choose it if given the option when going to this genre.

This game has a very Eldritch Horror feel to it... one could even say this is Eldritch Horror Extra Extra Lite.  Unfortunately, while it plays immensely faster than Eldritch, it loses that wonderful narrative and storytelling aspect in the process.

Bottom line: If you're a fan of Eldritch Horror and like Buffy, then this is a no-brainer. This box contains a great little coop game that provides an intense, interesting, and satisfying puzzle to solve at a very reasonable price point. I look forward to playing more of it.

Finally, a good Buffy game.

Took me about 6 plays to see how awful this game is. The draw mechanic for resolving tests and the special abilities setting off the event cards to summon enemies and have bad things happen is horrible. You can't plan out anything since your penalized for using your special abilities and when you do it just summon more baddies after you just used your ability to clear some. I wanted to like this game and did the first 2 plays then it was all down hill. Doing the same thing, dragging on with the slightest of bad luck, having no control over the accumulation of the Apocalypse track, and having turns where you had nothing to do but wait for the other player to get the items and go try his luck at drawing the right card to cash those items in to defeat that monster or big bad card.

Very repetive. Collect items to kill the monster of the week 3 times. Collect more of the same items to kill the plot cards which were attached to the big bad which kills the Big Bad.
Fiddly, the baddie activation phase is too fiddly and too much book keeping. So many other games i would rather play.

A light co-op game. Nothing mechanically interesting or new if you've played other co-op games, but the theme does keeps the game going and the length is just short enough that it doesn't overstay it's welcome (2 games with 2 players is under an hour each). It's rather fun to see old characters facing off the big baddies. The theme comes out more when the boss comes out - (The Master easily swarmed the board with vamps!). I just wish it had some more decisions or mechanics.

The only negative that irked me was the randomness involved in trying to beat the mini-bosses and bosses. You have to collect items and then randomly draw a card to see if you succeed or not - more often than not you do, but I had a string of 4 failures once which made it a chore. Failures which meant you had to discard the items collected and have to go and collect it again and retry. It would have been nice if they made the requirements harder in the beginning but easier for each failure - or some other way to mitigate the randomness.

This is an ok co-op game, but it was very disappointing for me overall. The theme doesn't come through well at all. The gameplay feels very dry and detached, and also very limiting. Most of the actions feel the same - most of the locations feel the same - most of the event cards and the monsters feel the same. Everything you do feels too small and the fiddlyness of controlling the monster ai (and constantly having to make decisions for it as well), and also the constant reshuffling and token flipping make the game feel almost tedious at times.

There are some interesting ideas here. The game looks quite nice and all, but it just doesn't feel complete or engaging. I honestly have more fun playing the 20 year old Buffy: the Game, despite its heavy randomness.

WARNING: These comments contain spoilers about some card effects in the game, strategies, etc.
1. Solo play first game, with Buffy against The Master. Monsters of the Week were Dracula, Machida, and The Trio. Dracula is tough in solo play with only one character. Still, Buffy was taking care of business and up until The Master's reveal, who needs the Scoobies? Then Sunnydale was quickly overrun and Buffy had to agonise over acquiring items to take him down or protect Townies. Two consecutive Event Check fails against his Plot Cards had fatal consequences and a third would have been catastrophic, but she nailed it in the end with a Scoobie level victory. Well, it was her first attempt ...
2. Solo play with Buffy and Giles against Mayor Wilkins. Monsters of the Week were Luke, Der Kindestod and The Gentlemen (lost a Wound for talking to myself!). No Event Check fails against Plot Cards in this game, but two early fails against Monsters of the Week. Finished with another Scoobie win, with Buffy killing Wilkins and Giles standing by with the necessary Items to attack the last Plot Card if she failed. Which sounds comfortable, but the Apocalypse Track was at 10 the turn before. Four demons at City Hall. Somehow, those three Townies that were holed up in Glorificus' Mansion (captive?) for several turns managed to survive, thanks to some garlic, Buffy, and some good fortune that compelled them to separate to player choice locations at just the right time. That, combined with Event Cards which put more Baddies on the board than Townies, helped a LOT. This could easily have been a defeat.
3. Buffy, Willow and Giles against Adam. A Slayer win, in round 5. Monsters of the Week were Acathla (who didn't get the chance to activate), The Trio, and Machida. Used some rare downtime actions to heal wounds - 6 total. Didn't seem that important at the time, but the Apocalypse Track would have been at 10/11 at the end without it. No Event Check fails at all in this game. Lots of other things went right, like Event Cards converting doomed Townies to Vamps or Demons, and Baddies being equidistant from Townie locations where choosing the least threatening option was extremely helpful - both happened multiple times - plus nobody turned evil.
4. "I'm afraid we have a slight apocalypse." Buffy, Willow, Giles and Spike against Glory. Monsters of the Week were Luke, Machida (who killed two precious Townies) and Kakistos. Things went well at first, with Luke dusted and no wounds on the Track. Three consecutive Event Check fails against Machida were costly, but Sunnydale seemed to be under control at that point. Not for long. Glory's reveal, putting 4 demons on 4 separate character locations (when they should have all been hanging out at the same place; maybe Revello Drive drinking tea) coincided with the Event Card where demons had to be stunned before they could be slain. Bad combo. Another Event Card put a demon in Glory's Mansion where 3 Townies were holed up with double garlic protection, a vamp in Buffy's house with an unprotected Townie, and the card effect also caused a wound. Three on the Track with one card! This was a rare case of leaving the Special Action til last, and paid for it that time. Another ill-timed Event Card: just after three fails against Machida, where characters lost 6 items in their combined attempts, the next card effect compelled all characters to discard an item unless one could discard an artifact, which we couldn't, having just thrown out the Holy Bible. Perhaps surprisingly, given all this, the game was still close: One Plot Card was taken out and two characters had the Items to take out the other two next round, but the next round never came. Because, apocalypse. Fun game, very tense. Learning points: the City Hall location use action can sometimes be efficient to save lives, and must explore artifacts more (though haven't played with Angel yet).
5. Buffy, Willow and Giles against The Master. Epic! All three characters arrived at the Hellmouth with the items needed to take out one Plot Card each. The Track was at 10. Three Townies would have been insta-killed in the upcoming Monster Activation phase. Two of the three actions needed to take out the Big Bad were Special Actions, prompting events and Big Bad special attacks. If any one of them failed: Apocalypse! But one by one they got the job done. Phew! Monsters of the Week were Rack, The Gentlemen and Bezoar. There were 4 consecutive fails against Rack which nearly ended the game early, but the luck turned later on with Giles slaying 6 Baddies with D'Hoffryn's Amulet just before The Master's reveal, and then the three consecutive successes at the end.
6. Buffy and Spike take down Glory! And not a moment too soon: the Townies were stacking up, plus we had the Box of Gavrok in play. Monsters of the Week were The Trio, then (just after we discarded the Rocket Launcher) The Judge, then Ethan Rayne, who became Eyghon. It was a shame that Spike didn't get the chance to use his special against the 9 demons and 2 vamps holed up in The Magic Box.
7. Buffy, Willow, Spike and Xander take down Caleb. Just. Almost lost with one Plot Card left, with 12 wounds on the track. Very close! Monsters of the Week were Machida, The Judge, and Ethan Rayne/Eyghon. That pesky Box of Gavrok was in play most of the game; there always semed to be more important things to do than getting rid of it, which was perhaps unwise. Will return to this one to take on The First, continuing the game state with the same characters.

We hired Lynnvander Studios to make this game for us and they delivered everything we asked for in the Buffy Game. I know we make the game, but personally, this is one of the only board games that I desire to play over and over again! Absolutely love it, and great job Team Lynnvander for working with us to make this dream come true! 

P.S. I plan on releasing "Hard Core" rules for players that want a nearly impossible version of the game at some point. Not sure if it will be part of the game, or just a fun thing we post somewhere for people to try the challenge, but I know I, for one, want to see how hard this thing can really get!

Have played twice but the family are all big Buffy fans.  I enjoyed the second game even more than the first, of which I was jonesin' to play again.  Good sign.  Can't wait for the expansion!

After 8 plays, I'm still loving this game.  Added a small "fix" to mitigate some of the luck that has made it more enjoyable.  I know there are better games that accomplish the same thing (looking at you, Pandemic) but the Buffy theme is anything but pasted on and that makes this a win for me.

This is a really good board game.  I love how thematic it is and how the game play supports the theme.  The rules are their own thing and it's easy to overlook some of them and feel like the game is "too easy" or "too hard" or "not thematic" but that's mostly human error.  The rule book isn't terribly hard to read, it's just a lot of people expect the rules to be copies of other games and therefore they get misread and remembered incorrectly.  Expect to spend the first game with your head in the rule book if you want to play it correctly not because it's complicated but because it's its own thing.  

That being said each game is like a season and each turn is like an episode.  Everyone has to bust out a special move during each episode and it's got to look like the Scooby Squad bit off more they can chew at some point.  The tension builds to the final show down which can be brutal or not depending on luck and other things.  Because the show made all the characters important it doesn't breakdown like other games do when you play a character besides the main one.

A good example of a well-made licensed game.  They put some nice details in the game for fans of the show. The game itself is on the lighter side and plays quickly.  This enables me to play the game with those I know who are fans of the show but not necessarily gamers (This is a problem with longer games like Battlestar Gallactica and Firefly). The fact that it is cooperative helps get non gamers interested as well.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game!  Usually games based off of fanchises like this are passable at best..... but this was EXCELLENT!  It reminded me of Pandemic where you would travel to locations trying to slay demons and vampires while keeping the civilians safe... All the while getting episode cards that alter the game quite a bit... sometimes hilariously (queue the musical episode!)

Note: I am a big BtVS and AtS fan. 
Thematic, but no graphics for the various monsters of the week. Fixed by another user's graphic file in the files section. Wish there were additional characters.
The game itself is very simple. I wonder if the mechanism is too simple. I find that the game is easier to win than I expected. Played against The Master, Mayor Wilkins an Caleb so far. They are differently flavored, but not by a huge amount it seems. Need more plays.
Wanted to love it...but I don't. It's merely okay. That said...I will not trade it. It's Buffy. Will get any future expansions for completeness.

Played this once and will probably never play it again. I didn't find the game fun and felt (as most co-ops do) it suffered greatly due to the co-op quarterback.  

As for gameplay, the people you tried to rescue were frustratingly dumb and it was a grind to save them as wave upon wave of baddies would arrive and delay things.  When you weren't saving people, you were grinding out cards to attack the main bad guy.  We could only hold 3 cards a turn and always had the wrong cards which caused you to go replace them with the right ones.  Lots of grinding, not any fun at all.

When I first played this game I was not sold at all, being dragged in by a buddy to play the game, and Spike felt kinda weak and I hadn't seen the show. However, I loved it when I got to murder 8 demons and 4 vampires in one shot and saved the day for everyone! I felt so useful, and when we faced off against The Master, the card flip thing felt so fulfilling, I hadn't realized how suspenseful it could be, more games should be like this.

This is really a cooperative pick up and deliver game where you go to locations to get items which then defeat the baddies at other locations. Apart from the Buffy theme the gameplay is pretty mundane.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed this more than I thought I would, given Jasco's track record. This is a very Pandemic-like cooperative game where you are overcoming Monsters of the Week (Think underbosses) in order to reveal the Big Bad villain to be taken out, all the while keeping Townies from dying and accruing too many wounds. I'm a big fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and they certainly got the terminology and abilities of the various characters down pat (Though a lot of the Big Bads are slight variations on each other, such as The Master making vampires stronger and Glorificus making demons stronger). I like that there are vampires and demons wandering around town to take out, and a lot of the iconic locations are represented well.

Having said all that, I don't know if this design was done with the Buffy theme in mind to begin with. The gathering of item cards, which represent things like crosses, stakes, and the catch-all "weapons," and matching their symbols to obstacles feels very abstracted. I get it...obviously stakes are going to be more useful at overcoming challenges with vampires, but why not inject more theme into a game that should be ultra-thematic? The matching symbols thing was cool at first, but now it feels like a cop-out for when designers want to keep a rule set extremely simplified. There are even moments where characters will turn evil, but this amounts to losing one action that is used to advance the evil side's agenda. Very disappointing.

Along with this, there are a ton of corner cases that aren't covered in the rules, though the rule book seems to be pushing players towards doing what will make the game easier for the them. Speaking of which, this game is incredibly easy for a cooperative game. Each character has a special power that you can use in dire situations, though you have to resolve an event card that might spawn more monsters and townies. I never felt compelled to use them though. The game is already very easy without them. To be fair, it comes with ways to make it more difficult, but I barely broke a sweat during my first game, and this was with only 3 characters. I feel like this is definitely a game that is more difficult with less players, similar to Arkham Horror (Especially since there's little in the way of scaling for the number of players), and playing with more than 3 or 4 pretty much ensures that you're going to have a much easier time.

Probably the biggest problem I had with the game, overall, is the exclusion of many important characters from the show. Nowhere is Oz, Terra, Anya, Cordelia, or many other characters I could name to be found. Angelus and Evil Willow aren't that well represented either with how lame turning evil works. Even the 2000 game from Milton-Bradley had the chance of turning good characters into vampires. These are yet more reasons why I'm not sure that this game was originally designed with Buffy in mind.

There are things to like here, but overall I was left pretty dissatisfied. It seems like most of the fun comes from taking out the Monsters of the Week, but when the Big Bad shows up, the game slows to a crawl as you're trying to gather up items and overcome their agendas. I wanted to like this more than I did, being a big Buffy fan, and I was really hoping that it would unseat the old Milton-Bradley game from my collection. While I think this is a more modernized design that also covers more of the show's run, I find the game from 2000 to be way more thematic, even if Oz is overly-represented as one of the good characters. Those who aren't fortunate enough to own a copy of that, however, may find something to like here. I'm just worried that those who like Pandemic-style co-ops may find this too random, and those who like thematic co-ops may find this to be too abstracted.

UPDATE: I was recently informed that you must use all four actions on each character every turn, but I don't think this changes my opinion of the game that much. I was still drawing an event card for each character every turn despite not taking advantage of the fourth action. This game is still just okay, and I prefer the 2000 game from Milton-Bradley more. Still holding out hope that the Buffy Legendary set to be released later this year fires both games though.

Lighter game in the style of Arkham Horror.  However, I found the game lacked that spark to really make it click with me.  The mechanisms are good and the IP is one I enjoy enough, but something felt a little unsatisfying.  I will try it again for sure and hope the next game clicks.

Played this at the local cafe with my Super Fan friend. I didn't know anything about the theme but she loved it. The game is a very forbidden Island with Vampires and Demons. I talked to a developer who worked at the cafe and got a chance to play a 2nd game with expansion content after losing the first game. Much Enjoy. Very slay.

Not quite difficult enough, and missing some of the "fun" that I expected from this license. But it's a solid cooperative (or solo) game with low complexity and a lot of respect for the license.

If I weren't a Buffy fan, then this game might not stay in my collection. I am, and it is.

Eager to see if the upcoming expansion adds a bit of spice to the gameplay, or simply increases the variety.

Buffy:The Board Game - the latest iteration - is far better than I expected it to be, and as good as I hoped it would be as a fan of the franchise. It has teeth. On the surface, it's similar to Pandemic or, especially, Ghost Stories. Vampires and demons are spawning all over the place, and you need to be efficient in your use of actions to control them, while preparing for a bigger threat that's looming over the proceedings and that you'll have to face eventually. 

There's nothing particularly innovative here, but it has that magical ingredient - the enjoyment factor, a fantastic injection of theme - that just makes it so much fun to play, especially with a team of 4 players. I love it and it's a great family game to play with my wife and 2 kids. I really hope we'll get an expansion or two that add more depth and characters in future. 

My only complaint is that the rulebook is dreadful and, for such a simple game, we've had to look up stuff on BGG and house-rule borderline cases way too often. That's usually a deal-breaker for me, but this game's so much fun that I'm prepared to let it get away with that.

RATING: 7
Well produced Buffy game that while feeling thematic at times also felt very thin compared to the old MB version.  That version was covered in Buffy quotes and theme.  

This game has a lot of the monsters of the week that bring some fun twists and the locations you know and love from Sunnydale but after that, you're just matching a few items and hoping to draw the correct symbol to defeat the monster of the week or one of the Big Bad cards.

More Buffy quotes sprinkled throughout the decks and a wider variety of items would improve the thematic elements of the game.  For example instead of having "wooden stakes" and "weapons" they could be replaced with a bunch of different stakes and a bunch of different weapons.

Overall this is a simple and fun Buffy themed co-op.  Great for Buffy fans.  For non-fans, I'd still recommend Forbidden Desert or Pandemic.

Fun for a couple plays but lack of variability means limited replay value.  Monsters and events all feel generic.  I prefer the Milton Bradley/Hasbro game as it has more Buffy flavor and tension.

After one solo play, I like it.  There's definitely love for the source material, and the game is pretty easy to learn/teach.  Many nuances of the backstory will be missed by those who haven't watched the show, but if you're a Buffy fan you can point them out to newbies, and if you've never watched it may spark an interest in checking it out (worth it... Promise).  Gameplay is straightforward, logical, and should be easy to teach.  If you don't like using the symbols for tests. it's easy to use a D6 instead. Looking  forward to more plays, and the expansion(s).

7 Initial rating. Played once today and need to play it again.
Pick the Big Bad, fight 3 Monsters of the Week and slay demons and vampires.
Set-up involves a number of events per player and picking the current Monster of the Week. Each player takes 1 of their 4 actions in turn, either searching, fighting, moving or using a location effect.
By defeating the Monster of the Week, reveals a plot token for the big bad.  Resolve the 3 plots to win !

Would be nice to see further expansions which include Darla, Faith, Drusilla & Anya for starters.

RATING: 7.5
There's no "night and day" track, which seems a bit wonky in a game about a vampire slayer. Also feels like the Event deck could use some side quests from other characters like Cordelia, Oz, Dawn, Quentin Travers, Faith, Anya, Riley, et cetera to flesh the story out a bit, as it's a bit dull. 

Otherwise, it's a pretty solid and easily explained co-op. Even with the completely lame cardboard Character stand-ups... and nothing special for the Monsters of the Week.

It really needs to be fleshed out.

10.1.17 - (1 play, 5p) This was kinda fun. My least favorite thing about the game was the artifacts. Components were fine (though thin cardstock) and I don't mind the standees.  I'm nota big co-op fan but I'd play this one again.

RATING: 6
It is a giant game of do the obvious, like most coops of this type. This is pandemic's cousin, with added in pick up and delivery. It's not awful, it's not great. Theme doesn't really shine, despite some good attention to detail. The game is laughable easy. Even for your first game you should throw in some of the hard variants. Hype was high for this one, so it's a huge disappointment. I'll stick to my Rob Daviau designed buffy game. 

:) Better than pandemic
:) Buffy theme tries hard to be there
:) Singing was fun

:soblue: Do the obvious

This game was such a disappointment! I had seem favorable reviews for it, but it just does not live up to its source material. Some of my issues are:

- The lack of art. What art is included in the game is very well done, but several of the cards have the exact same art. The Monsters of the Week all describe different characters from the show, but all just have generic art. The event cards just have small pictures of buildings. The item cards just have tiny pictures of the item at the top. Boring.

- The event cards. The event cards are super boring and just tell you where to put vampires and demons. They offer no theme. With a game like this based on show that was on for 7 seasons, they had a great opportunity to make event cards based on events that occurred in the show. What they chose to do was to make the "events" boring "place the generic bad guys here" cards.

- Combat. I don't like the event check, see if the symbols are matching combat system. Some people may be okay with it, but I feel like combat was a great opportunity to add some dice to make combat a little more exciting. Also discarding stakes and weapons doesn't seem to make a lot of thematic sense. It feels like that was just tacked on to make the game more challenging.

- The item cards. The item card mechanics don't make much sense. Why does holy water or a cross hurt a vampire across town?

It's too bad, because I would love to see a great game using this IP, but this game completely fails to capture the thematic elements of the show. It doesn't feel at all like you are experiencing Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Overly simplistic, limited tension, limited decay. But the real problem is in its total and uncontrollable randomness which can keep you repeating the same actions again and again. Literally, forever. (Or until you lose.) We were forced to give up on this 40-60 minute game after two hours of play and many "unlucky" card draws had us less than halfway through the game.

RATING: 4
"Eldritch Horror" light.

Being a fan of the TV/comic series makes me seek out all things Buffy. I've played some other BtVS board games, and at least one card game,  this is by far the best. 

That doesn't mean it's good! It's very random and has some wonky mechanisms: every player must use every action every turn - why? Despite it's many flaws I wasn't offended by it and did enjoy my time with it. Not sure if it will ever see much play but it will stay in my collection because I'm such a fanboy.

Theme comes through wonderfully.

RATING: 5
At first glance this looks like a smaller Arkham Horror-like coop game.  I am also a fan of the Buffy television series so I might be more inside the circle of potential fans for this than some others.  But I thought overall it was a pretty weak experience.

Every round in this game players take turns performing one of their 5 actions.  4 are basic which means they can move, attack, search, use their location's ability, or an item.  They also have one special action unique to each character.  The locations usually just give players specific items and the items each usually do some variation of the basic actions as well as are used for win conditions.

Honestly, the game is just really uninteresting.  It's easy, which is usually a death knell for coops.  There were several turns where I felt like I didn't have anything worthwhile to do.  There's nothing interesting in terms of events, items, or locations.  And the theme isn't really here at all.  Not to mention the art is some grotesque facsimile of the characters that was really off-putting.

All in all I would avoid unless you are specifically looking for a light and reasonably easy coop with this particular "theme" to draw people in.

RATING: 9
Great art work.   The game is challenging and has a good amount of replay value.  The quality of components is good, great line cuts on the push outs.  Every turn felt like it was progressing the game and there was a sense of urgency.  I never felt like I was wasting a turn doing nothing.  Wish the Monster of the Week cards had artwork instead of the basic background and really wanted this game to have figures.  I am a fan of the show and I was very happy the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A decent co-op game that seems reasonably balanced, but has a few major issues. Like many co-ops, it's possible for one player to dictate to everyone else what to do. It's also extremely random, which means that you can waste turn after turn if you get unlucky draws. The theme didn't come through as strongly as it could have, but maybe I'm just not a big enough fan of the show.

I like that it seems to be a very simplified version of Arkham Horror but with a Buffy theme. 

The game takes a good amount of time to play (not too long and not too short), there is a good selection of characters included, the only part of the game I don't particularly like is that checks are done by turning over a card.

RATING: 8
A great deal of fun for fans of the show, as well as people who just enjoy a solid cooperative game. The different Big Bads add some variety to subsequent playthroughs and the characters you can choose from have interesting abilities. Being a fan of games with story, it would be nice if the "plot cards" had actual text describing part of the plot in addition to the negative effect it provides, but that's a minor nitpick in an otherwise solid game.

Initially has a pretty steep learning curve but only for the owner/host--once you have a good understanding of the game, teaching it is not overly difficult.

I can guarantee that we didn't play 100% correctly.  My colleagues rarely study rulebooks or FAQs intently, and with Buffy the rulebook isn't great anyway.  So even if we did buckle down and consume every word it wouldn't matter.  We'd still be guessing at some things.

Anyway, as a buddy stated, this is more like Pandemic than anything else.  Or [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/65532/defenders-realm]Defenders of the Realm[/url], perhaps, since Buffy and DotR share the same mechanic of luck-based "combat" (a cardflip in Buffy and dice in DotR).

Buffy is a light game of containing evil before it gets out of hand, and as such it wants to be short and sweet.  The game would suck, for instance, if you kept getting unlucky and flipping the wrong card symbols. A increased game length - and a random increase, at that - would not be in the game's favor.

I think this fits very nicely just under One Night Werewolf. It's much quicker and easier to teach, and is just a nice bit simpler. I like Werewolf for the craziness of the roles, but this is pretty fun too.

This game felt extremely random. You know possibly where a couple of cards are (scattered between a couple of people at the table) and that's it. The bad guys don't know who each other are and it's all about sharing information with no clear incentive to do so. Felt like a step down from One Night Ultimate Werewolf or Secret Hitler.

This judgment is based on just base roles in standard mode, taught by an Asmodee employee.

Great fun, unique enough to merit picking enough. A nice twist on the genre, though hardly revolutionary.

Light social filler. Simpler than One Night and leads to some good interaction.

Minimum player count should be 6, which is needed for Sniper mode. Only play Sniper mode. It's fast, it's fun, it's great!

It was better than I expected. It was also much shorter and different than I expected. Biggest complaint: the claim card doesn't list 'Assassin' or 'Decoy'! And I was not the only one complaining about that. No matter, we claimed it anyway! Many times. And it worked as many roles. You need to do a lot of quick face reads on people around the table and coordinate your shots openly to win. So of course claiming Assassin is a viable strategy as any role imho. Not a game that would make sense logistically for me to buy, but would play again.

I really enjoy this it is very light, simple and fast but I see that as key strengths. You can play 5 or 6 games in half an hour easily. It's incredibly easy to  teach and I've played with non gamers, but it's still interesting for me to play.

This is a decent game, but I don't think it's better than others in the genre. I would never choose this over One Night Ultimate Werewolf, for example.

I have no idea why this is rated so low here.  It is a fun social deduction game in which you are in and out in a few minutes.  Great ice breaker or filler to kick off game night on.  Doesn't overstay its welcome

This is a fantastic, quick social deduction game. It's super easy to teach and is very light- rounds only last 4-5 minutes total. It hits a similar itch to Time Bomb but is even easier to carry around with you.

My biggest complaint is that I don't like the bystander role because it's pretty much an autowin unless the right role scenarios line up where a role that could/should claim bystander is in a block of cards where the bystander could be.

This rating is a bit lower than I think it'll end up.  So far it fell totally flat with a 5 person group and went over okay with a 7 person group, but neither seemed to be the ideal group for this game.  Conversations were very stilted in both cases.

This game avoids two things I hate about social deduction games: (1) the initial phase where people shut their eyes and the traitors get to secretly identify each other; (2) the endless, endless bickering. It solves this by (1) instead just having everybody have limited information about their neighbours; (2) a three-minute timer.

Also, it doesn't joke about the Third Reich, so there's that too.

Still don't much like social deduction games, but 7 stars for anything I can play in 3 minutes and which doesn't feel merely random or mean.

A competent, if derivative hidden-roles/social-deduction game for 5-10 players.

Although it doesn't really introduce anything terribly new or exciting to the genre, it does what it sets out to do admirably and plays very fast (3 minutes or less per round)!

The setup/shuffle dance is a bit odd, but it works. Picture a table full of people with only a 33% clue of what is going on, shouting about who shuld get shot. Not a lot of strategy. Mostly social gymnastics with a fair amount of luck. Reminiscent of One Night Werewolf but with better art direction.

It was OK.  However, at the end of the day I would rather play any number of similar games (Resistance, Secret Hitler, One Night werewolf) over this one.

Hard to tell on a few initial plays, but I'm interested to try more of this.  I'd like to try some of the variants and other roles.  As a superquick filler, it seemed to work pretty well.

Crossfire shares several commonalities with other social deduction games.  Mainly, there are two teams and players are trying to figure out who is one each team and who has the key roles.  Each player is dealt a card, you pass that card to your neighbor, then cards get collected, shuffled, and redistributed in groups of 3.  So you will see somewhere between 2 and 4 cards, and have a sense of what typically 2 other players have for cards.

I felt like the game needed one more layer of chaos.  There just wasn't enough information to make interesting bluffs, and the incentives to tell the truth were low.  It wasn't terrible and it was super quick to teach and play, but IMO there are much better social deduction games out there already.

Sorry, but this is just way too abstract, and doesn't improve on the genre in any way. The most enjoyable moment while playing this was seeing Colby's reaction to the typo on the back of the box (at Nerd Night, Gencon).

RATING: 7
While it doesn't make a smoking wreckage of better social deduction games, it's easy to appreciate how Crossfire presents a rapid take on the genre that manages to present a solid mystery in just three minutes.

I really, really like this game. It's a quicker, more interesting, more streamlined version of The Resistance. Plus, they've included loads of optional roles for keeping the game interesting.

Feels very Twilight-Imperium-y to me, but since I really like that one that isn't a bad thing.  The heroes and questing were an interesting side-game that turned out to be very important, as a possible source of additional Runes or other valuable reward cards.  It was nice to see combat resolved with something other than dice.

it's a grand strategy take on WarCraft III, only with demons instead of orcs. And instead of trying to simply destroy everyone else's base, you have to find the dragonballs before the other players do (6 of them anyway). I'm not really familiar with the setting, but it seems like your normal high fantasy fare, with every hexagonal acre of land having either a dungeon, a dragon, or a town of evil sorcerers on it.

I think I would like it more if heroes interacted more with armies. And if the event/combat deck didn't make me feel like I should be card counting.

This game has "epic" written all over it -- especially with four players (not so much with two, but it's still a good game -- just not "epic"). This will hit the table more often than Twilight Imperium will.

This is such a big game in certain ways that my opinion will be swayed over time. Right now, I'm enjoying it a great deal, and it certainly has a strong element of immersion to it -- my favorite part.

RATING: 8
Good game, a bit fiddly due to the removal of dice and replacing with resolution cards (which almost always slow down a system). Seemed like a more streamlined fantasy version of TI3 and works quite well (and at a quicker pace), but will have to give it more plays to find out.

It's so over the top, it's funny.  Seriously, you couldn't get more Ameri-Trash if you flew the Stars & Stripes in a landfill.  Tons of plastic, cards, and counters.  Even plastic mountains!!!  Yes, plastic mountains you insert into the tiles.  How A-T is that?  Loads of eye-candy and mega-goodness.  I imagine Mr. Konieczka taking this to the bosses at FFG and them saying, "That's nice -- but you aren't there, yet.  More plastic!  More pieces!!!"

As far as game play, I enjoyed it.  Lots of decisions and balancing-mechanism that make the game see-saw.

It is a good game and many aspects of it feel well designed. The heroes are important and can win you the day but for me the hero aspect feels a little like a second layer of game pasted on the base. Strangely, I don't mind this while playing but when I think about the game afterwards it strikes me as a not so smooth kind of integration. 
Combat is tense and fun and the 4 races are interesting and play differently. Unfortunately, some races are just better (or rather: more interesting?) than others. It might not hugley affect your chances of winning but it does to some degree and it also affects the fun you get out of the game. 
The order cards combined with the season mechanism is very good design and makes for interesting decisions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fantastic miniatures and great concept to use action cards to dictate what a faction is going to do next. Beats lots of game using a standard set of play sequences. This idea used in this game is pretty good.

Ultimately, it's like Risk game without the dicing part. All using a deck of cards with a predetermined set of results. Players that are not tired will card count. The game also mixes the elements of world of warcraft card power-ups to give flavor. Unfortunately, this often ends up having a very cluttered table. ( not an issue, but cards get flipped away sometimes.) 

Because of variable powers, it's impossible to know what your troops can do.....this is actually the good part of the game. 

An upgraded Risk game that is both fun and re-playable for all gamers. 

May not be for Wargamers that wants more control.

Much better than Eclipse (Sci Fi look-a-like) in terms of playable fun and senseless battles.

Runewars is a game that I have...complicated feeling about. So let's start at the beginning:

QUALITY:
Typical great FFG quality on components. Nice minis for the price (about Kemet quality), crisp linen cards with satisfying coatings, thick linen chipboard everywhere, hero minis, and tons more, All very good quality, with the minor nitpick that the map tiles were overly-matte feeling, like they weren't coated enough maybe.

UI/UX:
The design of the game is what can be described as typical early '10s Fantasy design, with wrought-iron and gold filigree everywhere. Obviously, this is inspired by other older Rune* games and gets a pass. It does the job, looks how you expect it, and doesn't get in the way. The Fate cards are a bit cramped but that's understandable since they embody every randomized check in the game.

RULES:
Terrible. The rules themselves make sense to a degree but they're written terribly. There was no careful thought to how it would be presented to a first-time audience at all. The first thing you do in this game is set up the board. That would seem normal except setting it up is an ordeal of:
1. Take tiles assigned to you randomly
2. Place those tiles strategically not to advantage any player unilaterally, in turn, after other players.
3. Have the first-player mark where home tiles are allowed to be placed next (I split; you choose mechanic) then everyone selects a home strategically and places their tile in a specific orientation.
4. Place your starting units in your controlled areas strategically.
5. Place your starting stronghold strategically.

All before you even know how units move/attack, what strongholds even do, what the icons on any hex represent, or what monsters will be spawning on any of them. The first impression for this game was permanently ruined to a catastrophic level as we threw pieces around randomly, feeling cheated out of what was clearly intended to be some intense mind-battle with other players. It set the tone for the entire game overwhelmingly negative. The designers NEED to add a starting board setup for 2/3/4 players with starting unit suggestions and an explanation of what to expect from each players' surrounding tiles in italic tipboxes. In fact it just needs more tipboxes in general; such as not being so attached to getting Supremacy bonuses eary on. Things you can only learn by BLINDLY poking at the game for 2 straight hours until it starts to make sense; except instead of going "ah hah!" you just go "FUCK. Guys, this move I made 8 turns ago pretty much screwed me" and everyone else looking and going "FUCK, I did that too". All this because of shit rules. 

You will waste hours reading, re-reading them (after forgetting the earlier rules), referecing them, re-referencing them, trying to make heads or tails of the setup rules, and ultimately feel like there's zero strategic depth to the game because no one knew enough to actually give it any. This is a game that heavily relies on the players being knowledgeable and strategic at literally every turn for any depth to exist.

GAMEPLAY:
Overall the gameplay is as expected from the cover and plays similarly to Kemet and Twilight Imperium, like a cross-breed: Make dudes on a map, move dudes on a map, fight dudes on a map, control points on a map, win game. There are a few nuances shoved in there like allying the monsters that spawn or completing quests with heroes but that's the gist. It's quite fun and quite a good premise once the game lets down its hair (read: once players have played for endless hours and finally understand the basic implications of actions).

Where it falls apart for me here is the constant all-pay bidding. This, for me is a complete dealbreaker and I don't have many things in games I can legitimately and without jest call "dealbreaker" more than an all-pay bid. What's an all-pay bid? In Game Theory terms, it's basically an auction where every bidder pays what they bid, regardless if they win the auction. It's incredibly stupid and actually a solved type of game with only two outcomes: Is the [thing] optional? If Yes: All bid 0. If No: Player with the most resources bids all, rest bid 0. I'm sure Corey thought players would try to outsmart each other by paying different amounts than this (and IRL, that's how people unfamiliar with the solution THINK you do it; because people are bullheaded and think they're so clever) but in reality, mathematics says it's not interesting. You bid all or nothing. And many times, it's over a victory point so you just bid all if you have the most resources. It's basically just a heavily draining tax on the rich (which makes them win faster) and changes everyone's playstyle to spamming influence gain for Winter; at least in the case of the Winter dragon rune bid. Every other bid in this goddamn game is all-pay using influence so it's hard to argue there's any real depth or interest here. It's the largest flaw in the game, worse than the lack of proper first-time setup rules; because all-pay bids are a completely broken mechanic (and illegal in the real world) and have been broken and uninteresting since they were first created. Dressing it up with fantasy gems doesn't change anything.

Overall, the 8 order cards are interesting since you can only play half of them and you get bonuses as long as you play them in ascending order. Granted, most of the time half their effects are useless unless another specific order was played just before them but they're a great mechanic nevertheless and a workable alternative to the Twilight Imperium public strategy draft (let's be honest, if that was in Runewars it would be another all-pay bid). Since it's simultaneous action selection, it adds another layer of depth in theory. In practice, no one really cares what anyone else is doing unless attacks are happening.

One good thing in the game is how it seems to welcome open player diplomacy by allowing players to trade hero treasures and influence (etc) for favors or other goods in the game. I love stuff like this because it really brings the table alive. It's a bit rarer in Runewars than TI3/4 just because there's more open and constant conflict in this game, but it's still there and very appreciated.

A prevailing thing that needs to change in this game is the never-ending BLIND payments/bidding. Not just the all-pays, but even when you try to ally neutral monsters (aka "diplomacy", though I've never understood how diplomacy is blind random chance). Since everything is resolved by this elegant fate deck, you get to spend those precious influences for more draws in the deck to diplomaticize monsters. However, there are only 4 successes in the 30-card deck. Which is another flaw...

The Fate deck is not very well executed. The idea is pretty good: draw X cards (where X is equal to units in battle, or a skill being tested by a hero, or influence spent for diplomacy, or really goddamn anything in this game) and check the correct area of the card for your resolution. Outside of combat, which unlike some other reviewers I actually believe is simple, elegant and quite well-executed; many of the other checks are just a goddamn nightmare. Unless your skill check for your Hero's quest allows both the success AND neutral case to get the treasure, you're probably taking a negative outcome. 4/30 chance is not good and it gets worse if other players have revealed more of them sooner than average. Worse, the diplomacy has you blind-bidding for cards. I haven't been entirely honest about the 4/30 since really that's just the *good* result; you can technically get a neutral result which isn't bad. But in a "war" game, you generally only take actions that are advantageous for you from an overwhelming standpoint before attempting actions with a chance at neutrality. That's called a FOOS or First-Order-Optimal strategy.

CONCLUSION:
Should you buy Runewars? I think if you enjoy TI3 for the expansion and strategic nature, it's a great buy. If you go for the political side of the game, maybe consider a different game that scratches the itch at a shorter time frame. If you haven't played Twilight Imperium, don't mind longer games with some obvious flaws, and really want a deep area control game, Runewars probably has Star Wars Rebellion beat (especially since it can suit 4 players and has more interesting faction asymmetry). The factions all seem relatively balanced, save for the horrifically overpowered Latari Elves (who win practically every one of the numerous ties in the game until a Wizard's Council who isn't them exists). The units are all cool and interesting. Fights can be dynamic and multidimensional, though once one starts there isn't a whole lot you can change.

If you're willing to put in some (a lot of) effort, Runewars can very well become a favorite. And if you're a Rune* game fan, this should probably be on your shelf at some point.

Somehow I expected Runewars to be more than a Columbia block war game (card-driven action, initiative, different capacities to take damage) seen through a Fantasy Flight glass (cards, loads of them, nice plastic miniatures, bloated rulebook).  

That's a little unfair. The fate deck is a clever idea, giving the different unit types their own feel with a minimum of fiddle.  The sequencing of orders is quite challenging, with the need to balance board situation with a desire to get supremacy bonuses, and whatever the season's event has thrown at you.  The game is far from a simple slugfest; influence auctions and questing heroes are at least as important as grabbing territory.

On the debit side, the modular board set-up reminded me of the random distribution of resources in Nexus Ops.  Resources you need within easy reach are the launchpad for the win, nothing much infront of your troops makes for a painfully slow start.  Those (nearly) impassable mountains also do much to determine who you can attack and where.

In the good in parts category is the limited game length.  Through this, Runewars keeps playing time manageable and avoids endless turns of bash the leader.  However, I've had the experience shared by several commenters of the game fizzling out just as it seemed to be reaching a climax after quite a slow start.

Component quality is what we've come to expect from FFG.  Artwork is both quite good and entirely functional.  Do yourself a favour and download Universal Head's rules summary.

Not my type of the game. I admit there are very elegant mechanics - great resources dials, nice use of Fate cards and differentiating types of units with triangles, circles etc, having Heroes next to units, Season cards - yet I don't find the pleasure in assessing "is it the moment I have to attack you or not yet?"...

I do think it's very good game in its category, thus the rate, but I don't plan to play it more.

this is a good idea let down by lousy graphics and too much down time.  i got too tired/bored to continue after 5 hours in our 4 player game.

Easily one of my favourite games. I absolutely love it. Unfortunately I haven't managed to play it for a long, long time as the game is quite long. The fate deck system is amazing. I believe it handles battles amazingly well for a game of this type and I like the questing "game-within-a-game". The seasons mechanic also kicks arse.

Classic FFG-game with lots of stuff in the box. I one way I like the asymmetrical factions, but I dislike that it's so difficult to "control" the game, because of the many abilities (of heroes, factions and cards). As any multiplayer wargame it also suffers from the "who to attack questions" that often turn into kingmaking. Anyway, still an exciting game with lots of stuff going on.

Played once: was terribly underwhelmed.  
I actually tried to make it easier for the winning player to win just so it would end faster.  This is a very, very rare thing for me to do.

Too many things going on at once that I just don't care about, and heroes seemed very lacking.  On the plus side, it was visually appealing, but that was about it.  The card mechanic was worse than dice since you could actually count some things (such as knowing whether all 3 successful diplomacy cards were out).

No urge to play it again.

Has everything I could want in an epic battle / adventure game. Fantasy setting, heroes (improvable), questing, resource management, army building, etc.

The only drawback I can mention, is Heroes do not directly affect combat between armies. But that is minor compared to the other aspects of the game. Each turn must be considered and if you want to be really good you must plan what you are going to do several turns ahead.

The finest fanatsy strategy boardgame one can find. 
Top-notch components make it visually striking, but more important it is a game with wide options to win.
Winning means not having conquered most territory, it is about getting runes and controlling the aeras with your units. 
The layering of battles (fought by four very different races), heroes, quests, diplomacy, economics, politics, randomness works  very well. Even the setup of the Terrinoth maptiles requires strategic thinking
The base game leaves a lot of potential for some expansions. 

Get the Banners Of War xpansion and you'll have an even broader spectre of options and events, more units and so on

A fun fantasy setting TI with Heroes instead of Politics.

A solid game all around, I like how the fate deck gives you some information on the odds you have of drawing a success out of a given action, but the game is not without its faults. Notably, heroes determine whether a game is won or lost, but they can really only be countered by other heroes. There needs to be some way for basic troops to attempt to hunt down heroes. Even something as fiddly as being able to spend influence during a mobilize to attempt to "see" a hero and battle it - as it is, heroes determine too much of the game while having too few weaknesses.

Game is best played with two players - larger games too often lead to troop standoffs while the heroes run around and do their business.

After 5 plays of this game, I have to say Runewars is an incredible game.

Let's go down the list.

Components:  I'm not much of a miniatures guy, I simply just don't care what represents my army on its path of annihilation.  That being said, this game has some nice miniatures with some being a bit brittle.  The hero miniatures are awesome though.  The components overall...great.  Cards are nice (they're cards, not too hard to screw that up) and the army resource dial thingy is superb (tough cardboard). 

Difficulty:  The game is fairly convoluted, but you'll be able to pick it up after 1 or 2 plays.

Strategic Depth: Awesome.  Focusing on Dragon Runes is important but maintaining a large and healthy army is needed to acquire the Dragon Runes.  Meanwhile, you need to use your heroes effectively for scouting and completing quests.  There's a lot to this game and the constantly changing map varies the strategy each play.

Gameplay: Really fun!  The season system is a great way to keep the game pace moving, to vary turn from turn, and to keep the player thinking ahead.  The card system for choosing your action is another exciting mechanic.  Army battling is unique and a nice deviation from dice rolling.  Dueling is OKAY, but it's not a huge focus anyways; although one would be wise to make sure his heroes are fit and ready for any future duels.

Theme: Artwork is very good and the theme for each team is well represented.  Each team has something a unique inherent dynamic mechanic at play.

Overall I'm really impressed with this game.  I hope for an expansion, although that'd be a bit hard to do.  Let's hope FFG finds a way because this is a killer game.  The price is steep, no doubt, but it's well worth it.

RATING: 7
Nagyon tetszik a játékrendszer, és sok jó ötlet van a játékban. A 8 kártyánkból minden évszakban 4-et használhatunk, de bizonyos sorrendben kijátszva többet érnek a kártyák, ez  egy nagyon elegánsan megoldott dilemma. A játék legszuperebb újítása a "harvest", amivel a rendelkezésünkre álló erőforrások pillanatnyi állapotát menthetjük, és az erőforrások termelése ez alapján történik. Ez a rész kiugróan jó szerintem!!! A grafika is bejött, nincs túlbonyolítva, cserébe viszont nyelvfüggőek a kártyák. Az egységek kialakítása is tetszik (talpak alakja), és jó, hogy egy erősebb egység általában lassabb, tehát a leggyengébb egység is jó lehet valamire... A szabály meglepően egzakt és nem is túl hosszú (kevesebb, mint egy óra). Még hangulata is van a játéknak, pedig nem vagyok egy rúna fan. Ami külön tetszett, hogy nem csak ész nélkül magunk előtt gyűjtögetjük a rúnákat, hanem hexánként csak 1 rúna lehet a pályán, így a sok rúna birtoklásához nagy terület is kell. Szintén nagy ötlet az, hogy a 6 rúna (ez a végcél) bejelentése után 1 évig meg is kell azt tartani a győzelemhez! Csak úgy bemondásra nem lehet nyerni. Az utolsó 1 év élethalálharc, nagyon izgalmas! A 4 faj elég jól kiegyenlítettnek tűnik, épp azért, mert nincsenek rossz egységek. Amelyik gyenge, az cserébe gyors.
De hogy ne csak jót mondjak: a játék elég hosszú. Minden év kb. 1 óra volt hármunknak, szerintem 4-en még a haladóknak is van ennyi. És 5-6 évnél hamarabb nehezen lehet vége (7 év a max). A hosszához képest viszont durván szerencsefüggő. A szerzett rúnák döntő többségét közvetlenül valamelyik kihúzott kártyán kapjuk. Van akinek 10-ből 0 ilyen jut, van akinek 10-ből 5... Tehát nem igazán érzem, hogy tenni lehet érte, inkább vakszerencse... A másik, hogy az évszak lapok (és általában az előforduló kártyák) ismerete szerintem nagyon fontos, ezek ismerete ill. nem ismerete óriási előny/hátrány lehet! Megdöbbentő, hogy milyen erős lapok vannak, ahhoz  képest, hogy 6 megszerzett rúna a végfeltétel, nagyon könnyen lehet hozzájuk jutni, de könnyen el is veszthetők. A játék hossza és nehézsége nem áll arányban ezzel a random szinttel. És végül: nekem a hősös dolog nem tetszik, mert a hősök kis küldetései kicsit erőltetettek, és feleslegesen sok szerencse kerül így a játékba. A rúnák java részét ők hozzák be.

First game flavor: good, complex area control game , left me with a hint of one too many rules and mechanics stuffed into it without actually being able to put my finger to what exactly was amiss. Needs immediate improvements or house rules to somewhat change the role of heroes in the game (kinda lame imo as the game officially stands with the base ruleset). Overall good quality of the huge amount of components included. Strategies a bit elusive for now but definitely worth looking into.

The verdict is still out...the setup of the board stinks, as it can take half an hour to find a map that works. Also, I think the game ends too soon, so will probably use the variant rules with more runes needed. Still, it is in many ways similar to Twilight Imperium, which is always a good thing in my book :)

RATING: 9.1
Although initially I was disappointed at the relatively small size of the army-scale miniatures, play has proven this to be a smart call by designer/publisher: the figures just fit the hexes, especially with a Dragon in company.  The whole package is well-produced.  I like the complexity level, scaling and balance between narrative drama and color on the one hand, and manageable duration of play and scope of game detail. I predict a rapid sellout and reprinting.  This is the fantasy empires game I've been waiting for, and more.   Exceeds all expectations.  I could write a fantasy novel based on the events of a game of "Runewars."

Enjoyable empire building and hero questing game.  This game combines mechanics from many other games.  The map set-up is a bit tedious and the game can run long, especialy with 4 players.  The gameplay itself keeps players engrossed.  Most of a ll it is fun.

Lots of different things to do and the game with heroes feels parallel to the main game. I couldn't help feeling a bit commercial about the game: I am not so sure how well all those mechanics tie in together. The modular board is beautiful, the combat mechanics work well. I would also prefer to gain immediately resources from conquered areas and then my opponent should force me to lose income by playing the Harvest action if my income does not correspond to my areas. Lots of other ideas about the game exist, but this is one of the epic games of choice.

This game took us multiple attempts before we understand the game better to even know how to start. However, once we understood the mechanics better, we were able to really enjoy the wonderful fantasy world.

Too bad it is only for 2-4 players. It would have been interesting if there are more choices of the races to play and more players can be fielded.

If you ever want to write your own epic fantasy trilogy - then play this game. Every game is like a new story with everything you need: armies clashing, cities ransacked, heroes on quests and duelling, while the manipulating forces seek the powerful runes.

RATING: 3
Runewars is for the gamer who wants theme above all else, like a roleplayer. Even though it uses no dice, this territory control / resource collection game feels chaotic due to all the different decks of cards used. At least that is my initial impression. With so many cards just about anything can happen. Aesthetically it is superv, but the combination of chaos and length of play kills my interest. Honestly these type of multiplayer games with a bunch of plastic miniatures and all sorts of pieces are not my thing. I also do not care for the fantasy theme.

Brilliant game, love the seasons and having to open the new world and getting side missions on top of the actual beef of the game.

Good quality components (as always with fantasy flight I have 1st edition I always hate the less pimped up 2nd editions) my only complaint on the game is some armies deffinatly feel a little more overpowered but hey that's life lol

Rating based on a very few plays (3 so far), but I'm very impressed so far.

Fantasy-themed and simplified version of Twilight Imperium 3. It's also shorter. My two quibbles with it is that it doesn't seem to encourage interplayer conflict and the heroes mechanics feel a little bit disconnected from the "empire" part of the game. Needs an expansion to add variability.

RATING: 8
Great game but I wish they streamlined things even further and maybe even removed parts. The heroes for instance seemed tacked on, even if I enjoy them being in the game.

I loved it but the reality is that I will almost never play it due to the length  which is  unfortunate because I don't think it needs to be this long.

An epic game of empire building. It has a lot of similarities with Twilight Imperium while being slimmer and faster paced than said predecessor.

Always had an awesome time with it, and the expansion just makes it that much better.

Really disappointing game. Only the art and large amounts of good miniatures makes up for it. I wanted to buy this game bundled with expansion (Banners of War), and I'm glad I didn't. The base game experience was not what I've expected. If you think this game to be a mix between Heroes of Might & Magic (videogame series) and mechanics similar to Forbidden Stars...give it a pass because it will not deliver. There are some good systems inside, but you can tell and feel it's a dated game, and all of it mechanics have been done better in more recent titles. I will be very happy to see new revisited version but I don't think it will happen in near future.

RATING: 7
After one mostly completed game (5 runes)

Good stuff: 
- Not too complex, 
- multiple tracks to improve
- not too unit dense, 
- avoids analysis paralysis by keeping choices straightforward and goals mostly clear

Not so good:
- Might be difficult to get a handle on which decision are actually helpful and which aren't (board changes less than one might expect in this genre)
- Luck might be a little too heavy for length of play
- Rulebook might not be up to the task of the game play.

Overall:
- Seems more solid than a lot of games in this genre
- Managing questing heroes in addition to armies was enjoyable and theme-y (the overlap between both was enjoyable also
- I thought the factions and resources were well done without being unnecessarily tedious to track
- The fate deck was a nice alternative to dice, but I did miss the tactile experience of rolling dice

RATING: 9
Deep, complex and thematic, Runewars is everything you can wish for in a game, even though sometimes it slows too much and in the end lasts way too long. 

Anyhow, the one real big flaw I found in Runewars regards the heroes: they just feel like a late and forced addition to the game as they’re disconnected from the rest of the events. They simply wander through the map looking for quests (and they can really do the difference here) but otherwise have no other real use in the game: in fact they don’t join regular units, take no interest in battles and don’t assist you in anything you’re doing. They simply don’t care.

The game could also greatly benefit from a wider number of season cards to make every game really different and unpredictable rather than just slightly varying the order they appear. (December 2012)

[b]Update[/b] - After playing with the revised rules I’ve noticed most of my concerns about the original game have been worked out: most important, not only are the heroes better integrated into the game now but they also play a major role in battles, as each of them allows a specific unit to draw one more fate card, which is both thematically appropriate and a huge aid to turn the battle into one’s favor.

Another big improvement is the prospective winner now has to state he’s collected six runes, show where they are and hold them over a whole year in order to get his victory: on the one hand it causes a «bash the leader» endgame, sure, but on the other hand it also prevents the much worse «the onlooker gets the best of a fight» effect from suddenly occurring.

Since the revised rules really improve on the way the game plays, in May 2013 I raised my rating from 8 to 9: although very long (and likely a bit longer than before), Runewars is a very enjoyable game now.

Rating after one 4-player game. Epic for sure. In the parlance of Joe Huber, I think there is "lots to do", in only a max of 24 proper actions. Different directions to go. Each event is something to do or react to, and the orders are typically multi-faceted. I was pretty happy with the lack of downtime as well, with the threaded turns, and simultaneous events. Afterward I was thinking about the different ways I could have played it. The combat system is interesting, and quick, which is a nice combo. I had worries about the heroes not getting to do much, but really, there is plenty to do in the game already. The "supremacy bonus" system is very interesting for creating some competing incentives for orders. Also, since there are several paths for victory (battle, bids, and heroes) and several supplementary mechanics (cities, developments, tactics cards, objectives) you can focus on just a few, almost ignoring others. This is pretty cool, in that everyone isn't doing the same stuff all the time. Plus, the asymmetrical factions really have different feels, based on their armies, dials, and available developments. I really want to play again, and I also think 2-player will work really well. Good stuff.

Edit: Played a 2-player game, and it worked very well. Map setup will determine whether you have a bottle neck, or a multi-front war. If my next game is as fun as my last 2, this might go to a 9.

Edit: Played a 3-p with exploration tokens. They are a nice addition, not too complex, adding flavor, but adding a bit of time. After a few plays, the heroes are integrated into the game just fine. Lost this game when I lost about 4 battles by a few points each. By the end, I had almost nothing left at all. Still fun though. I think this is going to stay an 8 for me.

Runewars is the sort of full-bodied, epic-fantasy game that does a lot in four short hours. Four distinct armmies and their heroes stride across a world full of magic, creatures, and treasures. Everything is handled through several sets of initiative and combat resolution decks that allow players to fight battles with surprising results. The  figures are also a treasure: many different types and plenty of them. All geared for players familiar with the Runebound-Descent universe. If you missed out on the old TSR Classic "Divine Right", then don't let Runewars get by you!

Enthralling game but with steep learning curve and long play-time. Lots of player interaction. Kept the kids and myself occupied for about 7 hours.

A further play with an adult group confirms the game play takes about 1 hour per game year for 4 players. With a full game taking 6-7 game-years, this one really does need a whole afternoon which is going to limit play-opportunities (sadly).

RATING: 7.5
Seems like a good game.  Took a bit of time to figure out all the rules, but once understood they made sense and worked well.

Not having dice is a good thing, but the fate deck still adds a bit too much unknowing randomness to the game.  The instruction book could have been worked out better, trying to page through to find things was annoying.  It has a lot of information, the index usually works, but with so many possible different tiny things it was hard to find answers to certain situations.

Biggest negative will be length of time, not sure how often I will have three-five hours to spend.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
In my opinion best with 3 players, since everyone will be able to interact with each other. But the players will need to balance themselves, and not all people are up to it.
With four it often gets down to 1vs1 and 1vs1 or 1vs1vs1 and 1, where the singular player has the best change of winning since people cannot interfere in time when he is getting close to the six runes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Inital rating - will alter as I play more.

Like it - main beef is it should have a recommended first game setup, as you have to build the map at the start and place the starting realms and you have no idea what is 'good' or 'bad' at that point. Game is quite long (especially at the start before you know what you are doing) and it's not great if you've messed up before even taking your first action because of a lame starting location. A 'quick start' preset map, maybe with reduced runes etc as a learning experience would really help.

As for what I like, everything else ... like the card driven action system, like the card driven combat, all feels a bit overwhelming at first though.

** Update, played it more, and still like it. See my review for more comments.

** Update, played it more, like it more ... and playtime drops quite significantly once players know what they are doing, knocking 2 player games out in about 50 minutes now ...

** Update, still playing, still enjoying it - rating increased to 10. Saying that really would like more races and quests - seeing the same ones over and over. Definitely prefer it with the encounter chits.

Very good remake of Battlemist. The remake adds a lot of hero/army interaction and adjusts the play area for the number of players. It also has a time limit and is quite a bit faster (less than three hors with three players).
It seems a bit expansive for whats in the box ( and the box a bit big).
Overall the game is over a bit to quick. I´m looking forward to try the epic version (hopefully soon).

RATING: 8
As an empire-building wargame, it's great.  It's fun to take a single race and begin conquering the world.  Map-building and race selection is an exciting exercise in asymmetric design.  The battle mechanism is great to play too, though not as fun to watch.

Biggest complaint is the heroes are a bit peripheral to the experience.  Integral, but not integrated.  Downtime can be large in a four-player game, but this seems to be a game that will scale extremely well.

Is this the closest I'll get to Heroes of Might and Magic in board game form?  Hmmm...

Juego ambientado en el universo de Descent. Hay cuatro razas (Elfos, humanos, no muertos y uthuk) que deben competir por ser los primeros en obtener el control de 6 runas. 

El tablero es modular y cada partida será diferente. Cada jugador controla una raza, y dos runas iniciales. Hay varias formas de obtener runas. Cada jugador durante la partida, también puede controlar uno o varios héroes que le permitan realizar aventuras que pueden tener como premio una forma alternativa de conseguir runas.

Es un juego muy entretenido y con muchas variables en todo momento. Cada turno representa una estación. Si en 6 años (24 turnos) nadie ha conseguido controlar las 6 runas, el juego termina igualmente.

Como siempre ocurre con fantasy flight games, materiales  y presentación sobresalientes.

Played 3 times. At first the game is quite appealing as many stuff are going around but eventually most of them are noises. Game may terminate in anticlimax fashion when one player claims several dragon stones at a turn.

Own Banner of War exp.

Very nice game with a smorgasbord of FFG game mechanics that do end up working well together (once one gets past the individual gears to see the mechanism as a whole).

As a fan of the Heroes of Might and Magic series on the PC growing up (my sister and I played nos. 1-3 to death), I was sold on Runewars as soon as it became available.  Modular boards, unique races with distinct units, fortresses, resource management, questing... it was all there.  What brings it all to another level for me is that this is basically a Euro hybrid.  Ameritrash wrappings, for sure, but the mechanisms that run this game are pure Euro.  The way the fate deck works, along with the one-per-season actions, assures that you have to take care sequencing what you do, and provides a very nicely balanced set of limits.  Do I take the action I need now, and give up future bonuses?  Do I push forward with that assault now, when it is advantageous for me to do so, even though the fates might be against me?  Such questions arise in dice-fests too, but the cycling of the seasons in this one adds a level of predictability and structure that is a hallmark of many Euros.  The seasons also prevent the game from going on too long - indeed, every play we've had of this (except for one game that was a bit of a route) has ended before we were ready.

If you come to this expecting a slug-fest, you might be disappointed.  Yes, there is combat in here, but the battles are less than frequent.  This is fine with me, because it makes battling more meaningful, it gives the game some weight and narrative pull.  This game throws in a little of everything, but blends all these elements to the point of perfection.  All we need now are expansions - more races and units would be nice for sure, but definitely more cards and land pieces!  This game (and many of Konieczka's designs) should become landmarks, simply because they can satisfy all kinds of gamers, from the light to the serious, from the fan of plastic and conflict to those introspective Euro lovers.

UPDATE:  Played a whole bunch of games.  Want to keep playing it more and more.

Runewars is so, so good.  Represents all that I love about tabletop gaming, but keeps the playtime in a good range.  Played four-player, which is the right amount to ensure that you don't end up in a two-gang-up-on-one three-player situation.  Will happily play with two or four in the future.  Would play the game again, right now, if I could.

Orders mixed with a random map, assymetrical forces, flavor, theme, a little chrome, good bits and some interesting mini games, but all in a digestible format.  Yikes, what a great mix.

I never thought a fantasy conquest game could knock off Wizard Kings... was I wrong?  Too early to tell, but I sure do love Runewars.

Can't wait for expansions, as long as the expansions offer additional nations/races to play.

All that said ONE CAVEAT - I don't like the fate deck for diplomacy... counting the cards, marking off the positive outcomes.  It takes a little bit of the fun and adventure out of the whole thing.  

UPDATE:  I think the fate deck works great for combat and questing.  It's a stroke of genius, really.

liebevolle Aufmachung, leicht zu erlernende gut strukturierte Regeln mit vielen Beispielen.

Das Spiel stellt eine gute Mischung aus Questen und Schlachten. Bei den Kämpfen entstehen kaum fühlbare längen selbst bei Massenschlachten, gut gelöstes Kampfsystem.

Tolles Spiel in einer etwas zu groß geratenen Box. ;)

This game is dependent on who is playing and what they are using as a strategy.  It can be hero heavy, or army heavy.  Managing secondary objectives makes a big difference, and the influence bidding is quick and easy.  Lots of things to manage, but once you see how it flows together by playing a game, it actually has good flow and makes decided sense.

Epic fantasy game - put aside 5 hours or so for a full game!

Love the quest system with slices of narrative punctuating the overarching strategy game.  It's a solid, interesting design.  The seasons element is great.  Also dig the way order cards work and the supremacy bonus.  A lot of stuff to like, although it is a rather long game and heavy/complicated, perhaps unnecessarily.

Two plays. Once as the Undead and once as the Elves. There is a lot to like in this game but there are also some questionable design choices that I think could be improved upon. None of the mechanics are difficult but the game feels rather cumbersome and overburdened with too much stuff going on.

What I liked: Multi-player fantasy. The theme. The nice hex pieces with fantastic integrated moutain ranges. The armies and neutral miniatures were quite well done. I liked the order card mechanic with four cards being chosen each year (one per season) and the lowest ones going first and receiving a bonus if the highest yet played. It produced the right kind of excruciating decisions that I love about gaming.

What I didn't like: The large number of decks of cards with occasional hugely overpowered cards. The fate cards should be scrapped and replaced with a d20 or d30 as the deck is too small causing the odds to change considerably between draws (see files section for creative solution). The 'heroes' didn't add anything to the gameplay, just another gamey/random way of earning a dragon rune or two. I wonder if they were shoehorned into the game because of FFG's previous games. The scale of the hero miniatures also makes them look as if they were just tacked on as an afterthought. I would happily chuck out the heroes and their quests and make this a military conflict game. It would have been nice to have stronghold miniatures instead of the rather plain cardboard tokens to match the great 3D mountains but that is a very minor complaint and I'm sure it would be possible to find some from another game (such as Kings & Things). The ability to ally with neutral monsters was game-breakingly easy (for those with influence) and must surely need some house rules to take into account the number and type of monsters being encountered? Finally, why is the box so big and the icons on cards, etc, so small?

Fragile minis; it's very fun to play but I have a little bit of an issue the way cards come up that cause runes to just start popping up all over the place.  Happens a little too much, injecting too much luck and artifice into it.  Still, I'm enjoying playing.

Runewars is a very ambitious game which tries to combine the element of area control, wargame with mission-based RPG system, results in a complex and time-consuming 4x(explore, expand, exploit, exterminate)game. The game takes seven turns(years) with four phases(seasons) per turn, which means an entire afternoon plus maybe half of evening in real world. 
  
Despite of its exhausting gaming experiences, Runewars is actually an interesting game with four distinguished races, various units and random map which make you want to play it again and again...only if you have enough time and willing to spend.

A fantastic strategy game with resource-type development and in the nice runebound-terinoth setting. Great components (I have the first edition with the mountains and thick board player cards) and smooth playing inderraction. I prefer the battles to be started faster, at 3rd year for example than 4th to 5th year (at least at the times that I have played it).

Plays great so far.  This new revised edition doesn't have the mountain terrain the previous version had along with some split up map tiles and some streamlined rules.  I'm actually happy without the mountains.  Just cutesy fluff that's not needed in this already huge game.

I really like this game.  It has it all, empire building, combat, and questing.  If the questing was a bit more developed it would be a ten, but there aren't enough turns to allow the heros to accomplish enough.  Probably my favorite FFG coffin box game.

This is the game I find myself pulling out these days when I used to pull out Twilight Imperium. TI is still a solid 10 in my book, but it just takes so long to play and it's difficult to get people to commit an entire day to it.

Runewars manages to distill the essence of TI and turn it into a very smooth running game you can play in two-three hours. Also, it looks smashing!

Update: Just played my first game using the Epic variant yesterday. People around here claim it's the way the game should be played. I don't think I agree. We played for over five hours and had only made it through five of the eight years before having to call it quits.

For me, one of the best things about Runewars is that you can get kind of a Twilight Imperiumesque experience in two-three hours. If you use the Epic variant this goes out the window and Runewars becomes just as long as TI and then... you might as well play TI! :)

Good game overall but I removed it from my wishlist after the 1st play.
There are various reasons like:
-extremely long
-even more longer setup time compared to a normal game
-very very unlikely people would play it among our group
-another playgroup of mine has already a copy
-some stupid rules (mainly the win condition both the 1st and 2nd are bad)

Even if I won't buy it I'm in love with these things:
-thematic
-amazing component, really fancy, looks amazing on the table
-fast paced turns after you catch up the flow

An interesting one this one... In some ways it's a war game but ultimately victory relies on the sub game of the questing. I can't really put my finger on how I feel about that yet... I think it was a good idea to put the game into the same world as Descent. Production is good although I'm not sure it really needed to be in the epic sized box. Based on one play as the vanilla humans.

I like this game very much. This game fits perfectly the complex-strategic-conquer-the-world-or-do-shrewd-diplomacy genre. I like to play it. Actually I like Twilight Imperium 3rd ed. more, but this game is much shorter and almost as complex. Each play lasts about four hours with four players even if some of the players have to think long on some of their turns.

The different factions in this game are not perfectly in balance in my opinion but closely so. I've won with all of them even though some of them work better as aggressors than others and my playstyle is often very aggressive. In recent games I've concentrated more on farming influence and then using it to generate Dragon Runes to win the game and I've found this method to be very efficient. What a shocking finding.

Pros:
- Plastic mountains. Say what you will, but I have the original edition with the plastic mountains and they rock! Pardon the possible pun. I like to push around figurines in these kinds of strategy games and the more the merrier.
- Map generation. I'm totally in love with how the map is generated from larger pre-assembled hex combinations for each play. 

Cons:
- The heroes. Their involvement in the game is not perfect. The expansion tackles this a bit but still not enough. I think they could use another questing phase during each game year. Games usually end during the sixth year and this means that the heroes get to act only five to six times during the game. This makes the training action for the heroes sub-optimal.
- Diplomacy. In this game you don't really have anything extra you could trade with the other players. Everybody ends up being a mortal enemy of every other player since turn 1.

I gave it a very subjective rating of 10, it is based on all I read and on the look. The rating may change  after a few games.

I played this game three times so I think I can justify my rating.

In each game, most players had 5 runes and were trying to get the sixth. It always came down to an "epic battle" where the randomness of the cards determined the winner. 

Nor do I care for the ruling that when multiple players select the same action card and none has influence points, then the player who started the game with the most influence points starts first. That's broken to me. I think it should then go by tactic cards or some other resource.

10 games now, 2 with 3 players. The extra player makes a big difference & adds both extra time & depth to the game. Very enjoyable.

First impression: 4 games, all 2-player. Plays fast (only one game got to 2 hours), well for 2 players and it seamlessly packs a lot of building, questing & fighting into that time.  I look forward to going the full 6 turns with 4 players but for now I like the fast play time for learning the game.

Wow...what a game!

A superb blend of tactics, heros, area control, and luck (love it or hate it....I love a bit of luck in my games). A truly great blend of fantasy, battles, heroes and some luck. No two games are ever the same with Runewars. There is plenty of strategy, tactics and luck and you have to be a gamer who is adept at modifying your strategy based on the current game conditions.

Most players either love or hate the game. From a family standpoint, there is much to offer. We've played individual games and had fun, and also tried some team varieties to help teach my younger kids (5 to 8) the game. The end result, win or lose, is that everyone really likes the 'whole' of the game. The look, the flow, the battles, the strategy...all have enjoyed it. 

It is the best game ever? *shrugs* Who cares! It is a fun, deep yet easy to learn game that serious gamers and families alike can enjoy. A must buy in my book !!!!!

Runewars has variable board setup that I like.  All players participate in forming the world as they like it.  The cards that are drawn before each season also makes sure that every year (round) in the game is unique.  You do need to plan a little ahead, as the activation markers limit your movements (as Twilight Imperium).  Quests range from simple to impossible, based on game conditions.  So luck of the draw can make some of the cards in your hand useless.  This was not too much trouble though, as it seemed to balance out.  Battles are interesting, but they can also be very costly for both sides.  The game is a little long, but my only complaint is the half-sized cards.  Runwars is a fun time, and has lots of replay value.

Only two plays so far but the game has really impressed the heck out of me. Even more fun that I was expecting, which is surprising! Armies, heroes and resource management all compliment each other really nicely. It is a more laid-back game than Twilight Imperium or Conquest of the Empire but decisions are just as deliciously challenging to make.

Won't be surprised if this becomes a 10 with future plays.

EDIT: Yeah, it's a 10.

I love this game!  It's like playing Warcraft III in boardgame format:  You collect resources, build strongholds and developments, recruit soldiers to battle enemies and neutral units, engage in combat, collect treasures -- it's got it all.  There's also a completely separate element where you control heroes who go on quests and duel other heroes, which is also really fun.  The components are top notch -- the figures look great, the art is some of the best I've seen in a game, and there are tons are cool tokens and cards.

The only thing that can potentially suck is how luck-based the combat can be, since you randomly draw cards, but it's still better than just rolling dice. Knocking some points off because it's so complex that we never play it.

RATING: 7
"Descent: Journeys in the Dark" just got fired.  The Epic scale of this fantasy game makes it better than the other games in the Terrinoth setting.  It's got the conflict, plastic, asymmetry, and theme, but none of the downtime.  Game length is reasonable for a game of this scale.  I won't need to schedule an entire game day months in advance in order to organize a play.

It will be fun to try different map setups, different factions, heroes, and objectives.  Nice job, Corey Kneicz…ahem.

Cool take on a strategy war game. Order cards with turn order and bonus abilities should be planned out in order to maximize potential benefits on the board. Card combat system is a nice change of pace from the usual dice mechanism. Routing units and army strength add additional layers to strategize through when deciding battle outcomes. Hero questing phase important to the flow of the game and victory point placement via runestones make the area control aspect of the game unique. Unique army units give each faction a different playstyle.

Great FFG components as usual with unique minis for the heroes, factions, and various units.

It's like going to a drive in movie (yes that still have those) and watching a movie with someone's car antenna in the way.  As annoying as that is, they have this hero that plays the same role in this game.  What were they thinking!?  That single aspect ruins this game.  Either make the hero a part of the game in FULL or remove him.  What a terrible decision!

I was soooo looking forward to this game.  Everyone at the session felt the same - bad idea.

I love this game, but it rarely makes it on to the table as of late. Problem is pretty long play time and very tedious set up. But when we do bring it out it's a special moment and we can be sure to have an epic evening of play. It really is grand epic game, maybe it even tries to be too many things at once, but I can't hold that against it. What it does, it does well. It's engaging and it's war!

Typical FFG production: Good art & pieces, blend of "dudes on a map" combat with questing for artifacts, lots of chrome by way of text on cards and a mid level playing time. For a moment I thought I was playing one of the other FFG games, but I'm not sure which one since they seem so alike.

Its good fun as usual though with jostling for space, back stabbing, retribution and plenty of claims by players that they're not winning. I prefer TI3 & AGoT in this type of game, but Runewars is OK.

[2013-11-11 Rating: 7.3 -> 6]
After playing Runewars again, I feel the need to adjust my rating. This isn't because there was some flaw in it that I discovered recently, it's just that my gaming preferences have changed since I had last played it. I don't really like direct conflict and "Dudes on a map" games anymore. I would still play Runewars if everyone else would want to play it, but I wouldn't propose it. 

But: If you do like this genre, I would recommend you give Runewars a try. It does a lot of things right. Alhough I still think that I could do without the tactics cards. They do feel too random to me.

[2010-07-10 Rating: n.a. -> 7.3]
Runewars is a quite epic game playtime-wise. Every player controls one race with some distinct abilities. Over the course of the game (which seems to last about one hour per player) you build your kingdom on a modular map, hire some heroes and attack your opponents. You do all this in order to be first the one to possess six dragon runes and win the game. If no one manages to get six dragons runes after six years, the game ends with the winner being the player with the most dragon runes.
The players plan their actions simultaneously by using cards. This mechanism is comparable to the one used in Wallenstein or Dungeon Lords. Per year, you play four actions. So you have at max 24 actions before the game is over.

Comments:
--------------
* I enjoyed my first game. I had a lot of stuff to think about and I felt like I had some control over my destiny, despite the myriad of cards that are drawn each turn and which affect the game quite a lot. The game is fun to play. But I also had the feeling, that the game could be a lot more streamlined. One of my favorite "wargames" is Wallenstein. And Runewars reminded me a lot of it. In some regard, Runewars seemed to be the more complicated brother. And I'm not sure sure that the additional layers (like the tactic cards) made the game better. Because of the easier gameplay of Wallenstein, you discover the important things that are needed after the first play. From this point on, the player who manages their actions better wins. I'm not sure yet, how long it takes until I reach this point in Runewars. There seems to be too much chrome. 

* I'm not sure whether I like the fixed resolving order of the action cards. Recruiting always comes after Attacking, so you can't add strength to your lands before an attack if you forgot it last year. While I can see why this design decision was made, I really like Dirk Henn's more flexible solution of the same problem in Wallenstein.

* The long playing time might be a show stopper.

Oy... how many game mechanisms can you fit it one box? Waaay too many...

There was one deck of cards, the ones that gave my race special unique powers, that I never even used. I turned them over once or twice while wading through the sea of possibilities between my turns and had to check my gag reflex. Clearly the designer aimed for 'epic' and landed on merely 'huge'.

Playing with a random tile set-up it was clear that one player got hosed and another had a very favorable opening position. Hours of dissatisfying grind later, the result was exactly as predicted.

I think if you gave a copy of this to teenage boys with nothing else to do (and no other games in their collection) they could house-rule out the flaws and play it enough to actually use all, or most, of the chrome. I think I would have loved it at that age. This explains my rating of a 5 even though I'll never play it again.

Pretty much your typical FFG plastic-fest.  Lots of pretty little bits, cards, counters, etc..  A very long, complex game.  Interesting, but I don't really care for games that run over 2 hours max.

RATING: 5
Long complicated diplomatic war games are not my favorite type of game.  This one is a more complicated version of Diplomacy (or Risk) set in a fantasy world.  The graphics are awesome, and the bits are cool, but the rules are overly complicated for my taste.  It seems like you could cut out nearly 25% of the rules and still get the same depth and the same sense of theme.  For starters, I would get rid of the whole Hero aspect of the game.  It is a weird subgame that doesn't belong.  I would also reduce the number of units.  Too many of the units are similarly bland (like all the different version of the triangle units).  It adds a lot of noise when learning the game, but I don't change my game play decisions depending on which triangle unit is in each space.  For strategic decision making, they are as good as being all the same.

With that said, there are many cool things going on in the game.  The core of the game is well thought out.  There was a time in my life when I would have absolutely loved the game.  (though I would have only found people to play it with on 1 or 2 occasions)

A game with a lot of subsystems but great overall mechanics. It's a wargame more than a eurogame - so expect conflict.

Actually quite easy to play and less convoluted than many other FFG games. I can understand the feeling that you seem to be playing two games at once. One wargame and on top of that some sort of Runebound light. Didn't really bother me but wouldn't say no to more interaction between the two.

Really fun, but just doesn't deserve the title (or price) of a Big Box game.  

Literally, the box is 80% air, the minis come up to Descent minis' knees, and the cards are baby-finger sized.  Figuratively, it doesn't have the scope of a game of Twilight Imperium.  It's a euro-war game like Warrior Knights or Shogun.  Can't knock off points for what it isn't, though.  Just feel ripped off.

Hero questing, armies fighting and neutral units in between. You just need to get the runes and control it. No dice but "fate" card driven fight solution. For the ones that don't like fate cards - in file section on BGG you have an option to use dice.

RATING: 4
Typical multi-player wargame issue.  In a four player game, if 2 opponents decide to beat on you, the 4th player will likely win.  Probably even worse in a 3er game.

I really wanted to like this game.  It had a lot of cool ideas.  It is however a very busy game with a ton of different cards, pieces, random "take thats" and moving parts.  But underneath all this chrome lies the same game redone a million times with the same problem therein.  It's no different than Risk, TI, Shogun, and the countless others.  You win by getting opponents to attack others and leave you alone.  The theme is good however and helps to suspend the disbelief that the game is unique.  If it wasn't chock full of it, I think it would rate lower.  I don't see it moving in either direction with repeated plays.

My history of Runewars play is a tale of initial piqued interest slowly declining over time into general disappointment. I enjoyed the initial phase of investigating the ins and outs and what have yous of the game’s mechanics and strategic structure, but ultimately I found the game a bit hollow. The armies and castles were only of marginal interest, with the true source of power being influence and adventurers, as they are the true tools in getting access to the game’s victory points. The game that is involved in pursuing these dragons runes is not interesting enough to sustain the game’s play time and frankly there are better 4X games out there. Additionally this game was the first that caused me to get tired of all of the chaotic mountains of components that come with Fantasy Flight games.

RATING: 4
A Fantasy Flight version of Columbia's Wizard Kings.

Here VP's are called "Dragon Runes", and obtaining them hinges on a very luck-dependent subgame. Like all of FF's oeuvre, it is all about talking smack and which tiny cards you happen to draw.

Lots of moving parts but none of them are particularly fun or stimulating. It does deserve due credit for removing lots of the typical defensive play and freewheeling politics of other empire games.

I really wanted to love this game because it has so much cool stuff going on.  But in the end I found it too restrictive and it just didn't all come together for me.  
Or it may just be that I always lose badly.  However, if I am going to spend so long playing a game, I think I prefer it to be more focused in scope, with freer choice of actions, and less luck dependent.  I actually think Conquest of Nerath does the hero side-quest thing better. 

I am also troubled that the map setup is so critical.  You can easily lose the game before the first turn if you aren't very careful with the positioning of your home realm. 

UPDATE Jan2017: I have found myself contemplating this game again.  I really did enjoy the unit and combat system.  I wish it would be reimplemented in a more cohesive design.  I would love to see Runewars get the FFG second edition treatment.

If this game had come out before Nexus OPs, I would have called Nexus Ops "Runewars on Rails".  That is a compliment as I really like Nexus Ops.  It takes what Nexus ops has and adds options.....great units, combat resoution and tough choices throughout...good stuff. Not sure if I like the Hero play or not yet...at first blush it seems to slow the game down without adding much flavor and the quest cards vary quite a bit in how hard they are to complete.

1st Play: Entered w/ the intent of it being a learning game.  After 4hrs. (including rules explanation, setup & play) we were ½ way through (3 of 6 years complete), and we did not want to stop!  But...it being a week night, with work the next day we called it quits.  The game flows very smoothly.  The most time consuming (and obviously the most important) action is the the role selection.  A lot of time is spent on analysis when determining roles.  This is at the top of my 'must play from beginning to end' list.
2nd Play:  3-player game & we finished in about 3hrs.  I like games that implement set-up as part of gameplay & RuneWars does not disappoint.  It was 2 evil forces & 1 good force - of course, an evil force won by capturing the last Dragon Rune.  Now at the top of my 'Must play again' list.
'Must play again' fulfilled! Another 3-player, 2 evil/1 good. With a short lunch break it took 4 hrs.  Still at the top of my 'must play again' list.
4th Play:  3 player game, 1 evil + 2 good.  After five hours we barely made a dent.

Each subsequent play I have dropped my rating by ½ a point.  I become less enamoured with each play.

RATING: 9
Although it will often be compared to TI3 (or starcraft), runewars is its own game, with a distinct style and elements not found in its other FFG big-box brethren.  Heroes and questing is one of the main things, as this gives you an alternative way to get points.  The events are another, although once you've seen them a couple times, you start to get a feel for what's coming up (there aren't many unique possibilities).  But direct conquest always remains an option.  Unlike many games where your points are stored on the VP track, safe for the whole game once earned, in this one they have to be placed on the board in a specific region.  Lose control of the region, and you lose that point.
The factions are fairly asymmetric, and it plays just fine with 3 or 4, where TI really needs 4 at a minimum and preferably 5 or 6.  You do have options for play length, as well.  The 1st edition had a short race to 6 points, starting at 2; the 2nd is still to 6 points, but you start at 0-1 and have to hold on to them for a year; and there's always the 1st ed long game if you're feeling really ambitious.  The map, made from modular tiles, is completely different from game to game.  Quests tend to be pretty same-y, but there's still a bit of excitement in seeing whether your hero can beat the odds and recover some treasure.  The actual items are kind of the least interesting part, because they get used so infrequently.  Most players seem to be unwilling to risk their hero in a deadly duel, esp. when some 3rd party could just swoop in and steal everything from the victor.  Picking on a badly-wounded hero is obviously a different matter, but it doesn't matter how much cool gear you have: you're unlikely to win if you're at 1 HP.
The staggered combat with initiative, routs, and damage is a little cumbersome, especially when the larger army will still usually trample the smaller one.  It works, though, and allows the factions some flavor in the units' special abilities and such.  It's also nice that killing guys or surviving is no guarantee of winning the battle: you have to have more strength left than your opponent, and if he's got a fortress, that's a hurdle to get over.
So, this is a fine fantasy empires game.  Lots of moving parts, but then, it's an FFG title.

RATING: N/A
●Was about to get the game last year (2011), but put it on hold as I'm getting starcraft (another big box) as well.
●Maybe 2011 will bring something new to runewars, like expansion.

Luckily my copy of Runewars is not suffering from any bent figures, although it can be easily fixed. Also, my copy was an old one (the game must been sitting on the shelf for a long time), judging by the game catalogue included inside. But I guess, all copies available at all FLGS are old ones as well (not that FFG is doing a reprint or something, just wish mine is a little "fresh").

After playing the game, I'm really digging the Terrinoth universe now. I wasn't when I played DungeonQuest (third edition), probably because Runewars is more heavily themed with the artworks and massive components. I'm eyeballing on Runebound (second edition) now, which falls in the same universe.

I'm surprised to see how many influence bidding occurred during the game. Feels weird Ameritrash game having that amount.

I love the size of the hex, it's not too small and not too big. Although the figures are small, the sculptures are highly detailed. Also, there's toooooo much air (but I didn't mind) in the coffin size box, it's totally unnecessary but I can imagine if it's for the box arts.

But all in all, another game that I'm inclined to, and luckily I'm made the right purchase. Now waiting for the expansion, which allows Heroes to be commanders to lead the army!

This game should be without heroes!
Why?

1. Heroes in many aspects are mini-game in this game. They don't interact with armies, just make some quests. It can be easily removed.

2. Game have a significant downtime, that could be cut by removing heroes.

3. Heroes can earn victory points more random, than you can do it other ways. Someone can "sudenly" win, thanks to his hero and some luck in cards.

Beautiful game and it kills me that I gave up my partially painted set during a move. Need to get the revised edition. I normally prefer scifi over fantasy, but this is really my preferred game over TI3. It's on the same level of complexity, it just plays in about half the time with half as many people. There are politics, seasons, free cities, and little heroes faffing about on quests throughout the game, and I love it.

I call this one fantasy Twilight Imperium.
Modular board is cool, 4 different factions are ok, season mechanic is decent, combat is half-decent (card draw instead of dice rolls) and heroes with quests are a nice touch. 
On the other side, graphic design is (as in many FFG games) awful. There is a ton on different cards of different sizes with art that is just generic fantasy art. The game can drag on pretty much, it is definitely all-nighter. And notorious world or Tardinoth is not my favourite setting.
One average 4x game in essence.

This game is incredibly long, but it never feels like time is passing at the correct pace.  You think, "Man, we must have been at this for at least 3 hours," when in fact you've been at it for 5.

The only hit, then, is that you have to make a day of it, like TI3.  Otherwise, you'll never finish the game. I can only recommend new and veteran players alike to keep the game aggressive or it will be a long walk to the 7th year.

This had potential for me as being 'The Epic' without the epic playing time.  In my three games, unfortunately, the game has been either longer than I would like or short without much player interaction.  My plays may have been a bit atypical in that one game we made a triangle-like map for three players but created a huge mountain range starting in the center of the base of one of the sides going towards the center of the map which caused all of us to funnel into one area without much interaction until late game.  The second game I played was a four player game in which the game ended on either round 3 or 4 and ended before there was one army battle.  The third game, I was determined to have more player interaction so we played the 'Epic variant' and I we were a lot more careful with the map creation.  Well, I did get my player interaction but after over three hours and being on round 5 of 8 we just decided to call it quits.

The five major things I didn't like about the game were as follows:

1) I don't like the pacing in the game.  The game feels too long with the Epic variant and too short without it.

2) Map creation can mess with the game a lot, especially with inexperienced players.  There should have been some pre-made maps included within the games rules which could be used until players become familiar with the game and realize how important the map creation is to a balanced and fun game.

3) Heroes.  It's been said before but here's my take: I find the heroes phase to be jarring in that it distracts me from the more interesting resource acquisition, tile conquering game.  I understand Heroes are needed as another way of gaining Dragon Runes as well as serves other functions with tactics cards and rune scouting.  It doesn't change the fact that I didn't enjoy what could be done with them and took me away from what I did find interesting.

4) I like the neutral units in the game but wish they had been delegated to recruiting in cities and not littered all over the map.  Like Age of Conan, it bothers me that part of the early game sees little player interaction because of the neutral units that are in the way.

5) This game is very random.  Some tactics cards are amazing but others a kind of ho-hum.  The quest rewards can vary an where between very poor armor to one of your victory points!  You only need 6 to win the game!  There is strategy to building your army a certain way versus certain opponents but combat feels very random.

Overall, I'm sure I sound quite negative about the game but I still actually enjoyed playing it... for at least some of it's duration anyway.

The dual aspects of warfare and questing makes this a more nuanced game than it first appears.  With the revised rules there is a shift towards the war aspect which is welcome although heroes still provide a viable strategic alternative.  This game obviously requires a number of plays to achieve familiarity but I suspect that it will significantly reward that investment.  The best 'dudes on a map' game I have thus far played.

Playable in under 4 hours, even with 30 mins to teach at the start.

I like how Runewars manages to fit such an epic game into such a short play time.

I'm not a fan of the map setup. It is so vitally important that the map is balanced, and i don't think the mechansim for building the map is balanced. I think the map should be built collectively or something before any determeination of races or order of picking the home realm is determined. Maybe a database of balanced maps needs to be created or something, i don't know.

True gem.
At first not as impressive as Twilight Imperium, yet after few plays I realized how good this game really is.
As of now it is my favourite "heavy and epic" ameritrash boardgame.

EDIT: after 50 plays still a solid ten; yes, I am completely sure this is an everlasting classic. Best game in my collection. I will play it anytime, with anyone and anywhere. The last truly great game from FFG, complete as a base set, just before they started to forcing DLC-like policy for their new, shitty, watered down turd, dressed up as board games.

RATING: 9
A very nice and good-looking area control fantasy game. I like the thing that this game is not a pure wargame. Your object is to gain Dragon Runes, and there are many ways to do that: a) recruit a huge army and conquer, b) gain influence for biddings, c) your heroes can accomplish quests to gain a Dragon Rune, and even d) there's one tactics card that let you place a Dragon Rune on the map. At first I found the game quite random, but when you get to know the Season events and benefits of Factions' Units better, Runewars doesn't taste that random anymore. One of my favourite games at the moment, I like Runewars a lot!

Updated 2013-11-19: Runewars, I still like it. Odd thing is that I prefer playing the base game without expansion.

RATING: 9.8
Great game, has elements from several games combined into one. I can't remember the last time I've had this much fun playing a board game, even the setup was a blast! Overall, the game is very well balanced and we ran into very few problems.

One thing I feel needs to be improved about this game is the hero dueling; it is far too simple and has no strategy involved. My biggest disappointment about hero dueling was that the hero's stats did not have any effect in combat.

Therefore, to improve hero duels, some house rules should be added to give an effect in combat based on a hero's stats. For example, strength could increase the amount of damage a hero deals, agility could make a hero more accurate (look at a different section of a fate card), and wisdom could increase the amount of cards a hero draws.

Comments are after only one play so far, and played using all of the stuff from the Banners expansion.

Lots going on with a lot of chrome and extra cards and events to keep track of, almost too much.  A lot of the game, like other FFG games, rests with the card text, in this case tactics, quests and season cards.  Consequently, the first game seemed a little daunting given the multiplicity of interacting card events and actions.

Hope to play more to further assess, so my preliminary rating is 7.

Played once, four players.  The event decks drove me crazy with the chaos they brought to the game, which is a shame because the game had some interesting ideas.  This was another game (Dungeon Lords being the other) I've played recently that seemed like two completely different designs (here, the main 4X game and the heroes subgame) duct-taped together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's surprising to see how elegantly all the different parts of this game work together. Very impressive design. My favorite aspect of the game is how well the heroes interact between questing and helping to conquer areas with your armies. It's also neat to be able to recruit some neutral units to your army for some additional special abilities to diversify your basic units.

Sadly, the randomness of tactic card abilities and card combat resolution frustrates me quite a bit given the length of the game. That and I just generally don't quite understand how to best engage in combat. I tend to either over commit my troops and then have to lose stuff to the "8 troop max" rule... Or under commit and am then forced to retreat a lot of my troops who wind up getting autokilled by whatever opportunistic opponent happens to be the next to act (since retreated units become routed and routed units can't defend themselves or move, therefore they all just die...) 

Ultimately, the game is just not for me, but I did enjoy the journey of it.

RATING: 7
Really nice modular board and the 3d plastic mountains are a really nice simple but effective touch. The hexes are large enough to contain all the mini's and tokens that may be required which is frequently an issue for other similar games.

The four different factions play very differently with the 'evil' factions caring less about influence and more about cards for random events and the 'good' factions more about influence and thus ability to dictate more the effect of lasting game changing events.

Within each faction there are several types of unit and this leads to several different ways to play the faction. Do you go for the elite army of few units that 'should' hit hard and fast or do you plough ahead with limitless skeletons that will keep getting up but are slow and pretty weak individually?

The combat cards are a really nice idea as it removes the die aspect. A card is turned over for each unit and dependent upon the shape of the units base dictates what that unit does this turn be it damage, magic effect, rout a unit or simple missing.

Neutral units may be fought or may be coerced into joining your army which has its risks. Quests also rely upon a similar mechanic whereby no die are rolled to see if you are successful.

We always play to a certain number of turns rather than to a certain number of dragon runes as this helps to moderate the game length.

Our first game took 8 hours, but what a great 8 hours. The rulebook is horrendous but there is an amazing game here, probably my favourite at the moment. I love the theme, the minis, the board, the cards. There's a lot going on but the system is very streamlined, elegant I would say. I got this for a steal on ebay, I can see the price tag putting people off, see if you can trial a game first, if it's your thing what you actually get for your money is very reasonable I think.

Have been recently updating my ratings, mostly taking down my previous 10's because of other games and enough plays. But this one is still a 10, don't ever think that this will change.

RATING: 5
Strong game, with no major problems for me except that it's too long and requires a bit of deck knowledge.

Duration: Simultaneous orders is good, and players should be able to run their turns without too much AP. However the game runs much too long.
Design: The seasons are great, the order supremacy and production dials interesting though a bit gamey. Combat is fantastic, though swingy (leaving a routed army completely vulnerable); I don't mind the bolted on hero game. The activation token mechanic is non-intuitive at first; the titles are mostly pointless; and the neutral diplomacy swingy and theme-crinkling.
Production: The evil mountains are fantastic, the miniatures good but fragile.
Theme: It's more generic fantasy plus some demon-worshipping barbarians, but the necromancer mechanic is good. Some elements are gamey (order supremacy, influence).

Update: It takes way too long, and is ultimately a who-attacks-whom game under all the mechanics.

RATING: 9
- Twilight Imperium 3 meets Game of Thrones the Boardgame. Combines elements of both games. VERY good game and quite underrated. 
- It's not as long as TI3 but still takes 4-8 hours in a four player game.
- Plays nice with two players as well! Three players is not recommended as it seems more balanced to an even number of factions.
- The downtime is not bad if all players stay involved during the battles and help setting them up & resolve them. But if you have lazy players who get easily distracted, playing on their phone when it is not their turn etc, then the downtime during battles can be high. Just keep everyone involved during battles and it is no problem...
- Expansion is heavily recommended as it adds a lot of interesting features.
- Fate deck is awesome if you understand how it is intended to be used. (It lets you anticipate the changing probabilities of success which change during the game depending on how many cards have been used, which is really nice and adds to the fantasy setting IMHO as it gives almos a prophecy or omen like feeling...)
- Go get it if you like a good heavy wargame now an then.

In many respects Runewars is very similar to Warrior Knights by the same designer. There are a number of notable differences (modular board, asymmetric player powers, and the victory conditions to name a few) but they do share quite a lot of the underlying mechanics.

Consequently, they also pretty much share the same verdict: Both are fine games but they are just too long for what they provide. The fate cards are probably the single most important factor in Runewars, and the difference between success and failure - heads or tails, basically, except failure is often much more likely - can be so ridiculously huge it's not funny.

I was looking forward to this when it was first announced and it didn't disappoint.  It squeezes the essence of what is great about TI:3 and really streamlines it into a game that can be played in a reasonable amount of time.  Maybe not the best value compared to the other coffin box sized games.  Feels like 2 more races should have been added (no doubt there will be an expansion).  I don't see the problem with the army units/hero units being disconnected.  As long as it is explained up front that they serve different purposes, it should be no issue when teaching it.  Another winner from FFG!

Yeah, Runewars is a pretty cool Corey K. game! I really love the look of it, and just the whole layout is super pretty. There's lots going on and many paths to victory.  Lots of delicious decisions to make as you play. Almost everything comes together in such a great way: the bidding, the Order cards, the season effects, etc. While the Quests feel like a separate thing that is not entirely integrated into the rest of it, they don't bother me too much. And combat might appear random at times (and why not use dice instead?) but I don't think there's much of a problem with the Fate deck as it stands. I think with everyone taking their turns quickly this is a wonderful game. But it can be a slog fest if there is even one player with AP. Overall, this might be my favourite epic "dudes on a map" wargame for three or four players.

[b][i]Runewars[/i][/b] distills my favorite portions of Twilight Imperium and adds a few new elements to make a concentrated, though neither simple nor short, game of empires clashing. Multiple aspects of the game--such as the action selection mechanism, the battle system, and resource management--reward planning and smart play. Distributing event cards by season adds a thematic flare that I appreciate. My biggest complaint is that the heroes feel a little out of place in this war game, but this is substantially improved in the Banners of War expansion.

I could go on, but, really, these mechanical aspects are just the backdrop to an epic clash of skeletons, gryphons, and dragons; what's not to love.

Well rated multi-faction area control fantasy game set in the Descent universe.  I picked up my copy at a local auction and glad I did.  Very reminiscent of the mechanics seen in Twilight Imperium (i.e. order cards, influence bids, secret objectives, area control) in condensed form combined with hero questing as seen in World of Warcraft the board game.  Beautiful modular board and miniatures.  Not a short game by any means, but with a strong grasp of the rules it could be played in one sitting.

Runewars in an excellent way of scratching that fantasy conquest itch. It has relatively simple rules (10-15 minutes to explain), four interesting and distinct races, a lot of variety, nice play time (2-3 hours) for its kind, and it scales well from 2-4 players. For me, the sweet spot is probably 3, but I'll gladly play it with any number. Reminds me nicely of Heroes of Might & Magic games.

The biggest flaw of the game is that at times the ending is bit anti-climatic, but even then the ride has usually been great.

RATING: 8.5
Enjoying this quite a bit.  Most of the 4X I want in a much more compact package than TI:3.  Pretty fair amount of battle and I love the orders system, much better than TI:3's Puerto Rico system.  I'm seeing a number of possible paths to take to win--influence vs. battle vs. heroes and some combination of those.  Will that be enough or is one better than the other?  Time will tell.  Heroes are mainly a rune generating mechanism but that's ok with me, I didn't have any other expectations about what they should do.  Nicely differentiated sides too.

I see more combat than most seem to in my games but I really need to play Epic.  Basically everyone I speak to says it is the real game in this box.  So if the normal game is getting an 8.5 for me, I look forward to the Epic variant!  As for heroes, I find them very interactive.  In most of my games there are a huge number of duels once rewards start coming out and I have run out of heroes in most of my games.

I agree that it should have 6 factions in the box.  But what it really needs more than that are more cards.  I never thought I'd say this about an FFG game but there just aren't enough cards in this box--quest, fate, reward, hero, season, etc.  Most of the decks, save the tactics deck, are suffering from too few cards in them.

The more I read about this one the more I want it.
I will definitely pick it up eventually, regardless of how expensive it is...it just looks and sounds way too cool. But, once again I have stopped myself from buying this simply because of the playing time.

Traded for Fresco and expansions.

At the very least, this looks pretty. Getting ready to dig-in.

It's a really good, solid game, and much less complex than I expected it to be. It's full of difficult decisions and often conflict happens after the first year, which keeps it from slowing down. But, it also creates even more difficult decisions.

It's what you'd expect from Runewars, and if you're looking for a good fantasy wargame/civ builder it delivers on all fronts.

The thing it could benefit most from is the addition of another race or two. Not that four isn't plenty, I'm always one for more variety in play styles to keep the game fresh for a really long time.

This one's definitely a keeper, as it scratches all the right itches when you want a good, meaty area control/conflict game.

Unless you play with AP prone players, the game clips along at a really good pace. The average 2 player game has clocked in at about 2.5 hours for me so far. With so many difficult choices presented to the player every turn, this could really bog things down if certain player types are confronted with Runewars.

Fun game. Feels like a good amount of chance is involved in the luck of the draw. But there is still alot of other things that are cool to manage. the order cards are the best concept of this game :). I do not recommend playing this with less than 4 people and I did suggest the longer version to experience the spoils of war! 
Their are some other flaws as we felt the heroes didn't add to much, but I've heard this is corrected in the expansion..

I recently reduced the score for rune wars for a couple of reasons. This game is long without a huge epic feeling of battle. I feel other 4 player games come out alot more because it isn't worth the setup. While it is fun deciding what cards to play and bid with each other, I feel other games do it better.

This game is more than a toy. While this is a typical Fantasy Flight fare with lots of decks and other components it feels more coherent than older epic FFG games, like Twilight Imperium and Warrior Knights. Actually, I think this game in many places will replace Warrior Knights as while it has the same feel is nicer looking and is more engaging. There are many things to explain when playing it the first time, but the mechanics are pretty straightforward. After you have chosen what to play during this round, most actions are pretty obvious, even though it is quite often disrupted by events.

I see a positive trend with Fantasy Flight Games with this and Chaos in the old world. The games are shorter in play time, while still feeling epic (maybe in both cases the games should last a little longer than they do). They both seems to be pretty balanced, well at least there isn’t a critical flaw with it.

Certainly it has reinvented (for the better) many liabilities of this genre, with nicely streamlined production and battle systems. Longish but the game speeds up with familiarity. Lots of moving parts and maybe could have been improved by one more paring pass to eliminate some of the sub-systems but the game is what it is and it is fun enough, generating a narrative and offering some conquest and expansion satisfaction for multi-player game night. Will play again, if I can find the opponents and the time.

RATING: 7
Pros: 
- the game after setup moves surprisingly fast, and faster than Twighlight Imperium, the game you cannot avoid to make comparisons with; 
- it gives you the idea of vast armies marching and amassing, clashing in spectacular battles (combat is very so better than TI3);
- it has many levels of interaction, Tactic Cards are important, more so Influence, and the "x" weapon, the Dragons or the Giants you can actually try to recruit!

Cons: 
- initial placement and map conformation are too important. A player who is in the wrong path of two other players or in the path of just one, while the other two amass riches, is DOOMED. There is no amount of dealing and wheeling that can save you from certain elimination. Thus house rules for the map making need to be devised.
- the hero mechanic seems just "placed" upon the game, with no real interaction with the true action. I didn't feel compelled to go and hunt the other players' heroes as they were a little threat compared to the massive armies that were about to clash. They could have used a "War of the Ring" approach, where heroes may command armies and do stuff that is truly meaningful. 

Random thoughts: 
- as with Twilight Imperium, the game is not about combat, but about making the more "points" to end the game. But there are two things that make it better: 1) you can gain more runestones in one turn without having to choose from a certain order to get more than one per turn; and 2) you may have to attack or use heroes to take the runestones from the territories of other players, thus making a war worth fighting for.  

What do I think: 
It is a game I'd give a solid "7". I'm usually willing to play this game, but I don't care much if I don't play it and I'll play it only if other people come up with the idea. 
It is better and cleaner than Twilight Imperium, so if you like that you will simply LOVE Runewars. 
If you do not love TI3, you still will think of the game as a very good design despite it may not be your cup of tea.

Great game, but the quest aspect takes up too much time later in the game. The Exploration variant added a tiny bit of theme, but otherwise questing just got in the way (no one used a single reward during the game, only at the end when trying to get that 6th and final dragon rune). The resource management and war mechanism is top notch, however. We'll definitely be playing this again.

I playtested this and it is a good game for what it is.  Components wise, it's the game I playtested that I most wanted to see the real components for because I knew they would be cool.  I don't really like the fake runes and am glad that Corey included a version to play without them.  I think they take away from the wargame feel and make for many "surprise" wins.  There are many comparisons to Twilight Imperium, but this games is much faster and shorter than TI:3.  Exploration tokens are a good idea, but they add clutter to the board and lenghten the game considerably.  It is a pretty game and fun to play, but really only with serious ameritrash gamers.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This could be great, the ultimate Fantasy warfare game, with the beautiful art and fantastic miniatures that you expect from FFG. But unfortunately it also comes with their usual excess of tokens, card decks and rules. I enjoyed my first play but was not very impressed.

I liked the action selection system. You want to play your cards in a certain order to get bonuses, but that order will not always be the best for your plans or to react to a game situation. The other mechanics, however, bring nothing new or particularly interesting.

There is an attempt to look original in the card-driven combat, but it is just a gimmick. There is no hand management, as you just take cards from the deck and check the results for the corresponding unit types. It is good that it is fast, but it could have been easily implemented with dice.

The luck factor seems excessive. The "diplomacy" mechanic used to gain control of neutral creatures is terrible. The relative forces of your army and the creatures mean nothing. You just commit influence points to flip cards, and if you are lucky to get one of the four good cards in the whole deck, the creatures ally with you. If not, you just wasted your valuable influence for nothing.

You win by controlling more runes than your opponents, and heroes are the most important means of bringing those runes to the board. That is awfully dependent on sheer luck, and the heroes feel completely detached from the rest of the game, barely helping in battles. The game might actually be better without them.

A few other elements could also be left out and would not be missed. I fail to see the purpose, for example, of the title cards, just one more thing to keep in mind that adds nothing to the gameplay. And yet another huge luck factor comes in the form of tactics cards, which carry all sorts of surprises. Of course, they are also largely unbalanced and their usefulness depends on circumstances. But unfortunately this bloated approach to game design is the modus operandi of this Corey guy.

All in all, although somewhat spoiled by excessive luck and complexity, it is not a bad game. It just had the potential to be so much better! But then again, my rating is probably a little generous, because the game is so beautiful and I'm a huge fan of Fantasy.

Primera Edicion en caja grande y con montañas en 3D. 

Gran juego 4X con una cuidada ambientacion y mecanicas de juego, destacando especialmente el sistema de combate con cartas de destino prescindiendo de dados y el sistema de acciones que a la vez condiciona el orden de turnos de juego por cada ronda. 

Otra ventaja es que es muy dificil (aunque no imposible) echar jugadores durante la partida. 

Su desventaja principal es que se hace muy largo. Aun realizando acciones "simultaneas" y poco paralisis, se va por encima de las 4 horas (y mas alla) muy facilmente. 

Top 5 y duro rival a batir en su segmento.

Not 100% sure yet on this one. It's thematic, and fun, and beneath its overly baroque exterior beats the heart of a moderately clean system. If experienced players can knock it out quickly, worth playing lots more.

Joc de conquista amb exercits de temàtica fantastica. Mecàniques molt bones. Unitats diferents i bàndols asimètrics. Atzar controlat excepte per algunes cartes que poden ser massa poderoses.

El sistema de victoria amb runes pot resultar anticlimàtic a vegades... Els herois son un minijoc a part... 

L'expansió millora el problema del final de partida, ja que ara el jugador que aconsegueix el nombre suficient de runes per guanyar la partida les ha d'aguantar un any sencer.

Actualització després de més partides: el joc m'agrada, les noves condicions de victoria estan molt bé, però els herois segueixen sent molt poc interesants i allarguen la partida molt, a més d'afegir atzar per que si. Després de unes 12 partides, m´he adonat que sempre es fan servir més o menys les mateixes cartes d'ordre, el que fa que resulti una mica repetitiu. Tot i que m'agrada i no em negaria mai a jugarlo, la duració de la partida i els defectes que te segurament no em compensen...

I really enjoy this game. Gives me a bit of a Twilight Imperium feeling in less than half the time. I seem to like it more than a lot of people on-line but I have had lots of success teaching it. I suggest using the 2nd edition rules (it teaks one or two small things).

Quite nice 4X-style fantasy themed area control game with solid simultaneous action selection core mechanic. There is lot of fluff, figures, cards and rules.

It's probably too long, but it's very good. It reminds me a lot of Nexus Ops, with a questing game laid over top of it. You really have to manage both sides and it can feel like playing two separate games sometimes. There's a lot of different cards, and my initial impression is that it may be a bit bloated, but I had an absolute blast playing this and would love to do so again. A few minor complaints in the design don't do much to diminish my enthusiasm for all the good parts.

Quite an interesting game, though not my favourite. The different subgames do feel a bit disjunct, the heroes' doings have little to do with what the rest of the army does. Also, the impact of luck through the cards that act like dice (without any reason as to why they're not actually dice in the first place) is big enough to make some plays riskier than they should be.

Nevertheless, there are some really neat mechanics and the game overall is pretty good.

A welcome respite from endless farming in the Brown Zone.

"Sack up 'n take yer beatin' like a man."

UPDATE:  Rating of 8 based on box contents & rules.  Actual play pending... but highly anticipated.

UP-UPDATE:  First play had the Elves exterminating the Humans to the last child and then erasing them from the Chronicles of All Times & Peoples.  THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE GAME.  Makes [i]Twilight Imperium[/i] look like a steam-powered jitney next to a Lamborghini... with a supermodel who's been eating cupcakes [i]for the last six weeks[/i] draped most buxomly over the hood.*  

[i]Agricola[/i], in its dreams, [i]wishes[/i] it was this nasty.

PS. The heroes are just fine as is.  They act as:

[i]Spies![/i] 
(they allow you to look at Dragon Runes so you know where the real ones are)

[i]Saboteurs![/i] 
(they can pop off spells in the midst of the enemy just before you attack)

[i]Assassins![/i]
(they kill & loot other heroes)

[i]Agents For The Win![/i]
(they can get you more Dragon Runes).

They don't need to lead armies if you're using them to best advantage doing all of the above.  Besides, hero ≠ general... do you really want some homeless wizard who smells like cat pee leading an army it took you two years to amass?

Runewars...finally I have found a game that feels like risk and civilization put together in a fantasy setting.

I finally got a chance to play Runewars and it lived up to expectations.  My rating is based on one playing of the game, but there's a lot of playing involved in a single game.  While the rules are not really complex, there are a lot of them.  We spent a good bit of time flipping through the rulebook during the first four turns (a "year" in game terms), but after that things moved smoothly.  All in all, the game played to the theme well while still remaining a good, accessible fantasy conquest game.  I'm looking forward to bringing it to the table again.

Large in depth game and often ends too soon, There is a lot of build up but not much conflict between players.

RATING: 6
It suprised me that there don't seem to be as many battles as I thought there would be & a defensive strategy seems to be important.  Also, it still feels a bit fiddly & slow moving.

The relationship between battling for control of a hex & winning the game with 6 runes is not straightforward - oftentimes a battle will take place, one player wins & we kind of feel, "Is that it?"

I prefer Warrior Knights to this.

The tie-in with Runebound is nice & the heroes really do add a (minor) level of "adventure game" (although the hero part does seem to interrupt the flow of the game a bit).

Also, the board is very pretty!

And it's quite good as a 2 player.

Update: Played the Epic game with a few players who were more enthusiastic & really enjoyed it.  It's still very long & a bit fiddly but that session has halted my falling opinion of it.

Further update: Played another 4 player epic & I'm just not sure this is worth the effort.  I could fit in quite a few better games with the time & effort required for this.

Extra change in Revised (for Elves): Word of Vaal: Your opponent must retreat one unit of your choice from the battle.

This game is awful.  The thematic flavor is excellent but that is it.  The game takes way too long, has to much down time and provides little enjoyment for the amount of time you spend playing.  A player can easily get pushed into a ruined game state early in the game even with reasonable lines of play.  He will then spend the next few hours doing nothing but awaiting the end of the game which drags on forever until one player suddenly says "Ha Ha, I have won with my secret play, that I have been waiting 3 hours to spring on you"

Hate the the fate deck mechanic, tedious, it is a horrible part of this game. I like the other aspects of the game.THAT'S WHATS MISSING - DICE 
I wanted to like this game too. I have heard many people defend the fate deck in this game, but it's the main reason this stays in the closet for years, because teaching the fate deck to new players is so counter-intuitive, for example, try explaining to a new player why his triangle units cannot hit, because all the triangle hitting cards have been played already, and he should thumb through the discard pile and recognized that.

Note provisoire 26 nov 2016 j'ai commencé à apprendre le jeux.  Au début on est un peu perdu avec les saison et les cartes d'ordre.  Je commence à comprendre un peu la synchronicité entre les deux qui devient plus important plus tard dans le jeu.  

Pour la critique des héros je trouve que parfois je ne sais pas trop quoi faire avec eux en plus que quand j'ai placé mes territoire je l'ai ai placé un peu loin des quest fait que je dois me tapper pas mal de move avant d'arriver à mes fins.

Il y beaucoup de chose à checker et je trouve que les runes sont difficiles à ramasser peut-être que j'ai pas trop la touch mais on va voir plus tard dans un autre partie.  

Les ressources c'est bon avec les plateaux individuelles de les resetter et on ne perd pas sans faire un autre reset.  Difficile d'atteindre la grosse bête fait que une chance qu'il y a les neutres que tu peux ramasser.

Je pense que je pourrais mettre un 9 facile car on travaille pas mal pour gérer les choses.  Je vais voir avec l'expansion.  J'aime bien Kemet mais runewars ajoute beaucoup de choses pour mieux étoffer.  C'est sur que les parties sont plus longues mais je commence à comprendre ce que les gens parle quand on mentionne le côté narratif du jeu.

Pi tant qu'à faire on réduit le nombre d'année si on veux des parties plus courte ou le nombre de rune à trouver.

A lot of different engines going on in Runewars. A bit sceptic at first but really enjoyed it and the asymmetric design of the armies. The only question mark is the mechanic for the heroes. The box is just too big impossible to bring with you without a car. For a wargame it's suprisingly quick.

Wow, way cool game, overblown as expected and overproduced a little, especially the box size but I like the theme and I think FF is slowly improving...

Definitely see the TI3 influence and MEQ too somewhat.  Not sure how bad the randomness is yet, so far it seemed okay, just thought the auctions were dumb where all the losers lose their bid, so basically there was very little bidding, any auction like this in any game I've seen is stupid and gets houseruled immediately in my house. 

Long setup and then had a bit of a slow build up, I wonder if the first few rounds could be sped up a bit maybe not sure but overall I thought it all came together pretty good and experienced players can probably get done in 3 hours which is nice for a game like this.

Overall a solid empire-building game. Seems like Fantasy Flight took the bones of Twilight Imperium, stripped it down and cleaned it up a bit, and viola you have Runewars. Some aspects of the game I really like compared to Twilight Imperium (each player having their own set of roles instead of being pooled betweent he players), but the game comes across as very fiddly with all the separate card decks and dual track hero questing and army movement

Initial Rating: 8.5 (September 2012)

I really like Runewars, it is perhaps the best game I have played in the Terrinoth realm :D. Konieczka has designed some very good games.

It is a big game with lots of cool components which I really love. Also, the art is gorgeous. The game can be long (my plays have been 6 hours and 4 hours) but as I´m immersed in it I don’t mind, and for the same reason, I didn’t feel any downtime. For me, it is very reminiscent of Twilight Imperium (I still prefer TI3). It has a lot of luck, but in most situations you can react to it so I´m not bothered (much) by it. I must confess it bothers me a bit when we draw the Special goals and the heroes missions. It seems the luck of the draw can offer a lot of advantage to some players, however the game is very good so I don’t think much about this.

The rules are a 40 pages monstrosity, but I enjoyed reading them :D. I must be a masochist. The game is not really that hard but it does have a lot of rules so the game is not for the casual gamer. 

The gameplay is great, you have a lot to consider and the decisions always are hard, you can only play 4 cards per year so you always feel the tension in your decisions. The game has a lot of alliances, betrayals and “take that” moments. :devil: It has resource management, control area and lots and lots of battles. 

The battle system is very well done, it eliminated dice and added the fate card deck. I´m not sure if I would have preferred dice but I still like it a lot. 

I feel the heroes don’t play a critical role in the game, in my second play we played with the exploration tiles variant which I feel it is a must, otherwise the heroes feel very plain and boring to me and detract from the fun. I will delve further in this point in later plays.

Building the map felt a little like a chore, furthermore if you have to do it again after making some mistake.

In conclusion, Runewars is an epic fantasy game which I enjoy enormously, if you like that kind of thing give it a try.

I’m not sure anymore that the Exploration tiles variant is the way to go. It adds a lot of uncontrollable randomness. Also, I’m downgrading its rating so my feelings are in concordance with the BGG rating system. Still feel this is a very good game, just not one I want to play all the time.

Today, I still like Runewars a lot! It lends itself to epic battles, that we continue to talk about even months after we play them. Good game.

I would like to own it, preferably the first edition as it has the 3D elements. For now, I won’t say no to a (programmed) game of Runewars as this is not a game we can bring casually to our regular game meetings.

It´s been years since I last played Runewars and in all this time, my desire to play the game has been slowly decreasing. Now, I prefer much more to play Euro games so I don’t think I will buy it. Due to this, I’m decreasing once more its rating.

Games with lots of downtime have been (slowly) purged from my game collection. I also don’t enjoy “take that” games anymore so my desire to play Runewars is low.
 
Runewars is no longer among my favorite games of 2010.

Only one play but pretty unimpressed.  For the playtime, there really wasn't much going on.  A slow start and few runes available kept the opening turns uneventful and then suddenly lots of runes came on at once and it was just a mad rush.  There are alot of games that do that "epic" objective-conquest thing and they are either shorter, handle more people [I like "big" epic games, not 3 player epic games], or most importantly, handle it better like TI3.  Not to say I would never play it again or that is was horrible, it was just "lackluster" for the time and component investment....and combat is droll and not as tactical as advertised.
It looks good and has some good ideas but alot of stuff is just worthless for what they add like the heroes.

This game can be overwhelming in terms of set up and some game play but it's worth it.  It's an epic game that does an amazing job of maintaining action for all characters because you have so many things going on.  Once you get a feel for the game and how it progresses, it gives you multiple game play possibilities.  This is my favorite fantasy themed game.

1st impression, but this is the best game I've played in a while. It's an "epic" game like Twilight Imperium, but I am much more enthusiastic about Runewars for the following reasons:

1) it appears to play much quicker than TI 
2) it seems like it will play very well with two players.
3) it appears to promote conflict. 
4) it has "role selection" of sorts, but I can select whatever role (action) I wish.  I'm not limited by the roles (actions) that other people select.  I tend not to like games where I can't choose some action just because someone else did.

I've played a few more times and my rating of the game goes up to a 10.  I think some people get a poor impression of the game because they try to buld a large empire instead of trying to achieve the victory conditions.  The game rewards agressiveness.  With the standard rules, the game is over relatively quickly.  You have to keep going after the runes whenever possbile.  I lost my last game by one turn because I hesitated instead of attacking.

I'm not easily impressed with a game right out of the box but this game blew me away! It's taken the BEST parts of several different games and melded them together into 1 Super game. You've got the map set-up and unit types like WARCRAFT, the card strategy of RACE FOR THE GALAXY, the resource management of CATAN, the questing Heroes from RUNEBOUND and the movement of TWILIGHT IMPERIUM. The miniatures are great and it's different every time you play it. I HIGHLY recommend this game. The only reason I don't own it is that the only person I'd play it with already does. Update: Got it! Couldn't resist.

Set in the world of Terrinoth, RW is a mishmash of recycled game mechanics syphoned from some of the better FF titles. Yet despite the similarities, RW can still be viewed as a welcome addition to any gamer's collection -because like most FF titles, it offers a rewarding gaming experience that's both fun to play, and pleasing to the eye.

Finally had a game with my G/F.  Unfortunately we were unable to play it through in on sitting due to its length but we both picked up the rules fairly easily and found it to be a really enjoyable game.  Not sure if it's one of my SO's favourites but she'd certainly play it again.  Me?  I love it.  The whole epic feel to the game.  At one point it almost felt as though there were two games going on (the civ building and the heroes) but these seemly seperate tracks do work together and I can already see how I'd play it more strategic next time around. I just need to fine the time...

Another RTS computer game boardgame:  you collect resources and build units and fight.  Pretty simple, but Runewars adds the heroes dimension, in the quest for a better endgame condition than dominance.  It mostly works, but the end can be abrupt.  I like it.  The action cards and the dials are the innovation here - both a bit gimmicky.  This is not a really long game - should take around 3 hours.  Battle resolution is also gimmicky and I am less convinced with this bit but its a noble attempt at a thematically evocative combat system which can be resolved quickly.  The main problem with the heroes is that they add downtime.  Tiles are very pretty but a bit 'busy' in the artwork - its a bit overwhelming and can make it hard to pick the units out from the board - a lighter colour might have worked better.  I think Mare Nostrum is still the leader in the 'RTS' boardgame but this is a solid entry too.

For multiplayer conflict games Runewars is as good as they get and I wouldn't mind joining in again. It has enough well-combined elements such as the order mechanism and the tactical cards to allow a player clever moves to sneak in the win. It's not too much free-for-all leaderbashing and the hero system introduces a nice counterbalance to simple military might. I'm just not crazy for this type of game. After one game I rate it a bit below my two benchmarks for this genre, Civilization: The Boardgame and A Game of Thrones. This is due to the Runewars fantasy setting that's not up to my taste and the ridiculous coffin-sized box and toylike components. In terms of gameplay, I wouldn't prefer any of them to each other without more experience.

RATING: 7
Playing the revised rules with the original edition; haven't really done much with the expansion, which is partially obsolesced by the revision. My initial impression was that the game was a pretty good 4x game with perhaps a bit too much rules overhead. Now having played it six times, including twice recently and once with the "best" four, I largely stand by my description. The resource-gathering mechanism (via resource dials) greatly streamlines what in most games is a length, repetitive round-by-round resource count. The orders system worked great in A Game of Thrones to reduce decision overhead, and it works pretty much equally well here--constraining without impairing. The combat system arose during a period when FFG knew that resolution could effectively be done with cards *or* dice but not, in my opinion, cards *and* dice, and while some would presumably prefer a dice-based mechanic, the range and control of options, and swings of randomness mitigated, by the use of the small combat deck. So why not a higher rating?

While the game isn't heavy or overly long for what it is, I find the effort in prepping, retaining, and teaching a bit much (and there's usually a lot of that because we go for a while between plays). The Terrinoth theme is fine, I guess, and its genericness not really an impediment in a game so focused on broad fantasy tropes, but the factions are, I find, really dull, particularly the humans', and the "evil" factions names and unit types are painfully adolescent in their ersatz Tolkeinism. I'm not sure whether the red faction is entirely balanced with the others in terms of units; maybe the expansion addresses this in its unit additions.

On the revision: I think I might prefer the revised edition terrain (sans the cheapy vacuform hills that don't want to stay in place and weren't used in the expansion anyway), with its smaller, more manageable/storable pieces, and I would, of course, prefer the very minutely updated/errata'd content, but I have to give credit to FFG for tweaking without requiring an update kit (or a revised-edition purchase) for first-edition owners. I think the revisions are almost unequivocally improvements to what was already a solid game (and was far from broken). Most adroitly addressed--something borrowed from the expansion--was the victory condition; in revised, players must hold the requisite number of runes for a year to claim an early victory (and the runes are moved out of home realms, pushing players into greater conflict). I'm honestly indifferent on the role of heroes in battle (haven't yet tried the Commanders of the Battlefield variant from the expansion). It's mostly harmless, and it's kind of thematic in a Conan-y sort of way, but it addresses a problem that wasn't really there to begin with, in my opinion, but was perceived so by some players--namely, that there wasn't enough for heroes to do. I kind of like the separateness of the two "games" going on--armies and heroes--but, again, it's not a dealbreaker either way for me.

I can't believe this is rated higher than Starcraft.  Enjoy wasting your time moving heroes about the board collecting useless treasure between the actual wargame.  Except when the treasures are dragon runes which makes you win the game, so that, uh, all your wargame strategy was useless.  Don't get me started on the weird shaped tiles that end up demanding more table space than they should and guarantee that players will at most only ever interact with one other player.  Somebody thought it would be a good idea to wrap a quest game up with a wargame into one big sandwich.  In this case, a shit sandwich.  But ultimately, for a game that essentially boils to random card draws (and I don't mean the combat cards), it is just too long.  If you are going to make a crappy game, please make it short.  Lesson learned: don't buy Fantasy Flight games set in the Rubebound universe.

* Update: so it's been over a year and people tell me that many of the things I disliked about Runewars have been fixed (somehow?).  I might be willing to play the game again, but the motivation will have to come from an external source.  I still have no desire to revisit this game.

After three plays. Map configuration and neutral creature placement can really influence the game; A 4-player game became two, 2-player games because of this. Our only 4-player game so far seemed to have a lot of downtime. The map and components are gorgeous but the hero system seemed a distracting afterthought; we forgot to do them during one turn.

Fantastic game. My current favourite for 3-4 players.
With experienced players a game takes long but not too long (about 3-4 hours), and this never fails to create an intense epic atmosphere. Also this game just look absolutely gorgeous even for something from FFG!
Also you can convince dragons and giants to fight for you - what's not to like?

Okay there are possibly a few minor drawbacks - sometimes it ends too abruptly, cities and heroes could have more impact on the game (only very minor points though)

First game takes forever and the game isn't all that engaging, because there is a lot of things going on, too much to keep track... So you are simply lost with that much information.

High toy factor, modular board, loads of decisions on your turn, a bit of strategic planning, a questing hero subgame, a bit of resource management, a bit of conflict, it's all there.  And it integrates more smoothly than you'd think...

RATING: 8
For just 1 play, I liked it a lot better than I thought I would. Took a while, but it's because the rules and components are a little fiddly. However, once you get going, it's pretty easy to follow, and I can definitely see the play time reducing a lot.

Great theme, the races seem to play very differently, and there is some nice decisions on the scale of epic games, but it feels a lot more elegant. I would definitely want to give it another go and see how it is without the initial struggle with the rules.

For some reason, I find that this game just bores me to tears.  Maybe less players, a smaller map to force more interaction?  I don't know exactly what it needs, but this game does not resonate with me.

A very good multiplayer conflict game.  Like many FFG games, there is a lot going on and until everyone understands the flow the game can bog down at times.

This game got me into board gaming and I owe it a lot for it. I love the simultaneous action selection, the command system and the epic flair. This one has great gameplay, epic flair, asymetric factions, awesome resource system. What's not to like?
Well, the game is just a little to obtuse to get from good to great. The heroes system feels bolted on and there is a just a little bit too much chrome. Especially the action card system - which can vary from useless to game changing - is does not to the game any favor. The game does not hit the table a lot because of it's playtime. 
However, when you break it out you'll have great time.

Great fantasy strategy (as opposed to smash monster/treasure rpg) game. Clever play mechanics and lots of stuff to keep you busy/entertained without getting too complex. Fantasy Flight nails their production values once again (except for some critical launch errata).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Almost gratuitous in terms of production; gameplay is not overly complex but occasionally seems to verge on overwhelming in terms of options and interactions of other players' selected actions.

Can be unbalanced by random selection of certain heroes or quests which might make obtaining runes easier/harder depending on combination.

Actually well balanced for such a huge game, considering the features and chrome it packs in.

I think I'm biased due to its fantasy setting - were this science fiction or contemporary warfare I would probably rate it higher. Oh well; it's my rating preferences, after all.

Just one play so far solo to learn it.  i'm sure I'm going to like the game.  Going to have to lose two points for Not going to be able to get to many people to play this game and for sure wife is not going to play it with me.  Maybe daughter.....could be to long for her to handle it.  Runebound is on the outside of her limits to being able to stay still and this is for sure longer.

Played this with a group.  Still pretty much learning it.  I liked it a lot.  I was in the lead or sharing the lead till the very last season of the last year and a new comer to the group play a brilliant move and stole the day.  It was really a great move.  And showed a very good fact to the game.  Do not leave territory defenseless.

RATING: 3
The army building in this game is just a waste of time. If you over invest in it you've given up too many scoring opportunities, so optimal play will be to produce just enough to turtle. This shouldn't be hard given the games stacking limits and movement restrictions. The real scoring comes from the questing, which is an uninteresting diversion. Runequest would be a better name, Runewars is just misleading.

It is a mix of all kinds of play things: races, heroes, hex-boards with water and 3D mountains, harvesting, fights with random cards, duel of heroes, spring/summer/fall/winter themed tasks...

I would recommend it for people who like RPG games, with lot of spare time... Which is not me :)

To me, this falls in the same category as Twilight Imperium.  It's a bit shorter, although still very long (I'd say 1h + 1h / Player) and long to setup too.  But plays is a bit lighter/friendlier then TI3.  

The length is capped, there is good theme and naration (through events, quests, heroes, etc.) and solid resource management / euro style action selection while clearly remaining a wargame.  Combat is nice, descriptive and satisfying.  Everything is streamlined without loosing depth.  Of course, Fantasy Flight managed to "summarize" 15 pages worth of rules in 40 pages of text, but hey, at least it's clear and it's sound.  Oh, and lets not forget the bits & pieces: this game is simply gorgeous.  I mean, mountains!

I have a hard time giving super high ratings to long (4h+) games and also to wargames in general.  This being said, both the long game and wargame categories, this certainly gets my vote.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This review is based on reading the rules and closely watching the first half of a game in progress. I also own the original Battlemist game, so I will sometimes make comparison to it.

If you like other heavy and brain burning FFG games like TI3 and Starcraft, you might actually like this game.  If not beware.

Personally, I think the game progress way too slow. There are to much stuff to do and think about to do something. Which in the ends makes a game that there is a lot of work for little emotional reward to the player.

All these stuff that must be done consist is selecting action, making bids and playing cards to eventually get the opportunity to move somewhere, attack somebody or build something. I personally prefer game where your units have much more freedom on their movement.

Another weird thing is that they replaced combat dices with a deck of random cards. I know that there is various possible results (damage, rout, special ability), but the original battlemist game supported the idea of routing. Is it too complicated to implement it with dices. The system works, but for me rolling dices seems more interesting.

Compared to battlemist, there has been a few improvements. For example, the resources dial makes resource management much easier. Having a map with groups of hexes also makes it easier to build the map at the beginning of the game.

Still, they have removed some feature from the original battlemist and it's expansion. For example, you cannot travel by ship. I am sure it would have added a good dimension to the game and prevent players to get locked in their corners. It is not possible to use heroes in battle, that's another thing that could have been interesting. There is only 4 players compared to the original game that had 6. Maybe they will add players in an expansion.

There does not seems to be various path to victory conditions. What was interesting in the original battlemist game is that, where was multiple ways to get stars of timmoran and in the expansion, you had a completely new victory path. In rune wars, there seems to be only 1 way to win, control rune stones.

So owning battlemist and being a fan of the "master of magic" video game, I was wishing that I could get a good game that I would like. Unfortunately it does not match my taste. I am not surprised that FFG have made a heavy game like that since that is what they do with most of their games these days. It seems that all games designed by Corey Konieczka have that curse.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

If a group was committed to playing this for a month or so, I think this one would easily be one of my favorite dudes on a map game.  The length of the game feels long in the first play as setup and rules can take a while but the gameplay is fairly fluid and straightforward once one begins play.  I really enjoyed how neutral units/monsters could become allies/recruited several different ways, each player has different powers and abilities with their race and different army types, and tactics cards really add quite a bit of variance and some chaos to the game as well.

[microbadge=419][microbadge=670]

A fantastic epic war game that dabbles into adventuring and empire building.  There are numerous elements to make this game stand apart.  The multiple lines of victory is foremost.  The creative, thematic, and realistic battle system is another.  The factions all are balanced well against each other, with no one having an advantage that player skill and politics can't blank.

The game is even more impressive in the context of Runebound 2nd Ed, Descent 1st Ed, DungeonQuest, and the always amazing Rune Age.  Terrinoth is an awesome place to game in!!

On the whole I like this title. This is definitely an event style game. After you're done you'll be spent for a bit especially if it's your first game. Everything seems to work fairly well and combat works in an interesting way so that strategies emerge for combined arms combat. The heroes seem kind of ancillary but they can be important in picking up a rune or 2 which can easily mean the difference in getting a victory. Play with the optional location tiles to make getting multiple heroes more important.

Not enough interest from other folks and too large/expensive to keep on hand if never going to get played.  An early purchase as someone trying to get into board-gaming, and a quick turn-around resale when I couldn't get anyone to play this.  I suspect I will regret this sale.

I'm very strongly drawn by the theme, as enjoy the idea of being immersed in an epic fantasy realm, and always enjoy the initial few turns, but ultimately there are big issues with all of the major game mechanics: specifically, too much luck in all areas including combat for such an epic game, and the heroes element is a clunky add-on that often wins you the game and can belittle the epic battles and long-term area control you had been working on. The biggest problem is the extreme length of the game, sometimes taking around 6 hours with 4 players. I have now played about 6 games. If I give it one more try, I suspect it may be the last, but then I think that each time...

Nice game, suffers from turtle strategy (in my gaming group usually combat starts in last year). Too long for too little action, would prefer TI 3 over it any time. Heroes questing feel like not well integrated mechanic. Combat usually plays like huge force is attacker and crushes smaller defender which makes it bit uninteresting.

On the other hand, this is visually most beautiful game in my collection.

An epic, heavy and complex fantasy area-control war game.

Gameplay:
+ complex, yet intuitive and interesting mechanics
+ unique races, with unique unit abilities
+ tactical and competitive
+ various ways to win the game (not only through combat)
+ well balanced in my experience
+ randomized map-set-up, quest cards, events, etc.

- the Heroes and everything concerning them seems to have no real value to the game. they don't contribute much to battles and outside of battles they basically travel around completely independent from the rest of the game
- the fate cards should have been replaced with custom dice for convenience

Components:
+ high quality components
+ A LOT of content in the box
+ great artwork
+ four unique races with separate miniatures

This game has a great strategy at the army level, but I always feel that the heroes aspect is an unnecessary bolt-on which doesn't really fit and just creates a distraction from what I would consider the 'main game'.  This is especially true when players hire 2 or 3 heroes each and that phase takes so long that people actually forget where in the game we are up to, by the time the phase finishes.  It also introduces a significant amount of chance through the possibility of finding and hiding away shards (which are converted to VPs).

RATING: 9
A lot of people, including me, probably did not need to hear more than FFG Big Box and Battlemist reinterpretation to put this in a top spot on their to-buy list. Reading the rules beforehand only whetted my appetite, especially the seasonal approach to the game rounds and the short and sweet combat system.

Since Runewars was one of our most-played heavies last year, the automatic buy turned out to be a good decision. What I find most remarkable about the design is that it handles an epic strategic scope within a playing time that is still compatible with leading a life in the real world. Full four-player games play out within four hours, and as we’ve recently discovered, a one-on-one match can be done within 90 minutes, setup included.

The strongest point of the game might be this: even if you get horribly mangled, you will almost always have a "Yes!" moment during the proceedings. Whether its a battle won against overwhelming odds, a dragon that, perceiving your innate superiority, decides to join your cause or a particularly clever strategic ploy that works out as planned, something good will happen to you. Probably a lot of bad stuff, too, because there will only be a single winner at the end, but still - something good will happen.

And the sheer variety of stuff that happens, with all the seasonal events and tactic cards and unexpected turns of the tide and whatnot, ensures that no two games have played out the same so far. In fact, we’ve not yet felt the urge to try either the longer game variant nor the optional adventuring places for the heroes. In time, we’ll introduce these and possibly will also have a look at the inevitable expansions, but be assured that this is a very complete and rich game in its original form.

RATING: 7
I hope it is out in time for me to put under the X-mas tree for myself! 

Wow.... I will wait to play it before I say it is a good game; but man it sure is pretty to look at. Corey K has had a good track record, I worry a bit that it will not be different enough from Ti3, but just a bit. 

1st play. Give this one my usual 7 after one play. Certainly lighter than TI3 and also a lot faster. I can see this being a 4 hr game even with the epic rules after we get the system down. 

I like whats in here, and I think this is a much better game than things like Quest for the Dragon Lords that scratch a similar itch.

I think we will need to tweak it a bit to make it work for us a little better. It is nice that this is something you can do. I believe that the epic variant would be better just because you will have to fight more to win. 

FFG wish-list.... More season cards with less of the auctions for VP's. These seem out of place in a game like this. Clearly added to keep the play time down It bothers me that 1/6th or even 1/3 of the win can be had via an auction. Addition season cards to thin the mix or eliminate these would fix this problem. 

The fate deck could have been 2x as large. We were rolling through this thing a lot. 

I admit the complains are nit picking but they should also be easy to remedy and I expect to see them in the inevitable expansion.

I love this game save for 3 issues, which is why I subtract 3 points: Heroes are tacked on as an uninteresting mini-game, the hero phase slows down the game too much and map construction is confusing and easy to get wrong. If not for these three issues I'd rate a 10.

A bit of sloppiness in the design of the heroes does not detract from the wonderful tension of securing that sixth rune token while the enemy army masses at the gates of your forward fortification.

Loving the Terrinoth realm, Runewars has an easy path to my heart. But the game itself is really well put together. Playing through the seasons adds some variance, the simultaneous action card selection makes every turn interesting (not to mention managing your supremacy bonus), even the heroes plodding around the map to complete quests all come together to make a delectable package.

There is plenty of action, plenty of decisions, and plenty of bluffing to be had in this game. Probably among the best 2 hours of gaming you can do with a group.

Lets not forget about the different map tiles and random tile placement and the neutral monsters!

Fab game, one of my recent favorites.

An excellent game, if a bit bogged down by having to look up rules and rule exceptions every 20 min (but then I've only played 8 times over a few months, so maybe after a dozen plays it'll all flow smoothly; I could aim that criticism at most FFG games I own, e.g., Fury of Dracula).  Still, if you're playing a 2p game that lasts for 3-4 hrs and you're still having fun, they've certainly done something right.

The heroes part of the game almost runs separately from the rest of it, so if you were teaching the game to new players (or wanted a faster version) you could probably just leave the heroes out entirely.

Great fun with 2 and 3!  [i]Played simulated 4p with two of us--Team Evil vs. Good Guys--a couple times, which was fun, but I still want a real 4 player game, and more 3 player games![/i]

Variants we use:
 - [b]Original win condition[/b] of 6 dragon runes, using false runes
[b] - Free Cities, which makes cities powerful and ups win condition to 7 runes
 - Expansion units[/b] for each faction
[b] - Expansion heroes[/b] (which integrate seamlessly)
 [b]- New terrain
 - Combat: Hexagon units[/b] count as standing even if routed during "Tally Strength" step
[b] - Combat: Hero Support[/b] allows extra fate card draw during battle
 - Most expansion tactics cards, quests, season cards (2 of 3 for each season), and reward cards.[/b]  We don't use anything with desolation or cryomancy tokens, so I've taken out the corresponding irrelevant cards.

Banners of War is a good expansion, but not necessary unless you play quite a bit.  However, it is nice to have 20 heroes instead of 12.

Download the Universal Head rules summary if you haven't--it's in the files section.  He does great work.

The hero game seems somewhat tacked on, although the BANNERS OF WAR expansion expands their role somewhat. And the table footprint is somewhat daunting. Not a game I'd play a lot, but with the right crowd can be entertaining.

RATING: 7
After 5 games (3 4P and 2 3P) I favor the 4P significantly.  I am still pondering my rating since it might vary based on how many are playing.  Will try 2P and then use the epic variant also.

Learning game was long and somewhat painful.  All games since have been excellent and the time to play has decreased.

This game incorporates stuff from: Warrior Knights, Puerto Rico, MtG, and many more  (the good parts in my view).

Overall this game is a 9 or 10 for me.  I am hesitant on the 10 since the results after 11 games are a little more 'random' (hate saying that) than a game like Starcraft.  The exploration tokens didn't change that - they might have heightened it.  We will try the epic version for a while to see if that changes anything.

Now, after 20+ games the rating is still a 9.  This game is a blast to play (about 10 3p and 10 4p).  The tempo is excellent.  But, like WotR some little things keep this off the 10 rating.  The fate deck being tiny is very, very annoying - a large deck was warranted.  When shuffling a lot I prefer larger vs. smaller due to my physical issues.

Highly recommended for people who don't mind a little chaos and enjoy a fast-paced epic-scaled game.  Easily met my high expectations for it - another great game by the FFG folks.

Early 2014 - sadly downgraded due to the replayability issue.  This game needs at least 2 more factions to allow a much larger variety of options.  Sadly, it appears FFG doesn't think this needs anything new.

This is a fun game.  Its epic fantasy empire building with a great replay value.  If you like the theme like me, you'll really enjoy the game from the first play.  Theres quite a bit of setup involved (with tons of playing bits and pieces) so it's best to have all that neatly organized or you'll loose the afternoon just sorting stuff.  It also plays well for a 2 player.  My wife and I enjoyed several games already!

A massive and rewarding game in true FFG fashion. Works extremely well with just 2 players and should be even better with more. It is long, but exciting right through to the end. Very highly recommended!

RATING: 9
The biggest problem for me with Runewars is that the races are too similar. The feeling is like in the computer game Warcraft II where humans and orcs had exactly the same units but with different graphics and IIRC the wizard units may have had some race specific spells. You can play Runewars with the same strategy with every race (the exception is the elves with their 2 starting food).

If I had designed Runewars I would have given every race an own tactics card deck that would make them play differently.

Looks amazing, and seems like a good game even though I haven't completed a play yet. Feels somewhat like TI3 minus a lot of stuff.

The 2 incomplete plays I have were all including inexperienced players and this is a game that takes a lot of time to explain and setup. Besides, I think most people will fail to play well on their first play and only really understand the game after one play.

Really want to get this going again with players that already understand the system.

Another great offering by FFG.  Solves some of the issues I had with TI3 (too long, combat is rarely rewarding) although it wouldn't be FFG if there weren't random cards that break rules and let you do "cool things" to the detriment of strategy and long term planning.  Still, a great wargame that's lots of fun.

RATING: 8
I like this game a lot, but after four plays it is safe to say that I suck at it. I tend to play a conservative, military-oriented strategy, which produces strong defensive positions and impressive armies but doesn't get you many runes. I have so far undervalued the hero/questing portions of the game, much to the delight of my opponents.

I'm not sure whether this means that I like the military aspect of the game more or merely underestimated the importance of the hero/questing subgame. I think it's a little of both.

I have some minor criticisms of the game, the most significant of which is that some of the ways of acquiring a rune seem a bit squirrely. Most of these criticisms, however, are so minor as to be essentially irrelevant. In other words, there's nothing "wrong" about them, they're just either not what I expected or not what I preferred. They still work quite well, though.

It's a beautiful game to behold, that's for sure. Mmmmm, lovely, lovely, lovely. I finally couldn't help myself and bought a copy, even though I doubt it'll get played at home. I can just pull it out and stare longingly at the bits.

A complete fantasy warfare experience which, played by the original rules, requires too much time unfortunately, suffering by analysis paralysis and balance issues. 

The rating would go to 9 if we consider the 2 player variant based on the official tournament rules (timer and points): https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1864083/my-wifes-favourite-fast-and-simpler-2-player-varia
The variant makes the game playable for us, by considerably reducing the playing time and introducing more balanced victory conditions.

Para nada el perro es tan fiero como lo pintan, no es un juego difícil , ni mucho menos. Lo calificaría de ameritrash medio. No es muy denso, aunque las partidas son muy largas, de mas de 2,5 horas seguro. Batallas muy estratégicas y divertidas. La parte de los héroes también es muy buena, ya que complementa perfectamente el juego. En resumen, un juego perfecto para jugar durante toda la tarde con amigos a los que les guste la confrontación directa.

Pretty entertaining 4 player game that really does not overstay.  Lots going on on the table and behind the scenes. interesting use of 'no dice' in a war/political game with the fate deck resolving everything.  

Can feel a bit gamey when players are attempting to stealthily acquire rune stones to win at the end of the game, but not too problematic.  It does open up the possibility for come from behind wins.

I really like how everything just fits.  I think there might should be another title in the game, but the game is clearly ripe for a stellar FFG expansion (but PLEASE make a Middle-Earth expansion first).

Does feel like there might should be a bit more for heroes to do, but they can clearly be used to enhance your position and can be used to grab rewards from other heroes via duels to cash in for runestones and/or do some runestone recon/etc.

A deeply complex game which takes elements of army building, resource management, strategy and area control all into account.  The four different factions have all unique units and feel very different to play (and will largely determine how you will approach a game).

RATING: 8.9
Birthday gift 2010 from the wife.

Brilliant design that seems to take the best bits from Warrior Knights, Twilight Imperium, even Chaos In the Old World (at least the variable player power bit) and boil them down into a refined core.

At first it felt like the Hero mechanic was a bolted-on and unnecessary complication, but in our first game it was the difference between first and second place - the winner being the player who exploited the Rewards to generate not one, but TWO Runes and push himself into the six realm.

I am very much looking forward to playing it again, and would even be interested in trying it with two.

--------------------------------------------------

Second play, three player game - completely tense and tight, and featuring a come from behind victory by the winner, where he swang from having three Runes, to six in one epic turn due to careful play of his quest rewards. I am starting to think duels are WAY more important that I originally thought, since the game is almost made in some instances based on cashing in quest rewards for extra rune tokens. Had he NOT done that, I would have take the victory right then and there by achieving my objective.

+.5 ratings bump. Next to try: two players.

-----------------------------------------------------

Ok A two player game where we punched each other in the face by turn two, and by turn four had torn each other to pieces. I eked out a victory by managing to gain a final Rune in a last ditch push into enemy territory, and it felt truly epic. I think if the starting player placement is right, the Undead are my favorite race to play right now, and the two player game is just about everything I enjoy about the game itself, condensed down into a knife-fight in a narrow alleyway. Another +.5 ratings bump. I cannot wait to play this one again.

--------------------------------------

This is getting constant play, and each experience is not only satisfying, new strategic depths are being revealed about the game - I have almost perfected playing the undead, and I have watched the clever ways that the elves turn their weaknesses (low starting food) into strengths. We are all now at a point where we can see the hero phase for what it is--the lynchpin of the game, and we now see three or four duels per game as heroes compete to steal each other's treasures. This game deserves another .5 ratings bump.

____________________________________________________

Continues to reveal depths in repeated plays. Fantastically intense with a group of four who know the game inside and out. Feels like it synthesizes the best of the current FFG catalog and becomes something greater than the sum of its parts. Getting nonstop play.

--------------------------

Ratings downgrade. Hits the table less and less, which is disappointing. I love it, it will never leave my collection, but I think my tastes are evolving beyond what it offers.

Aquí nos cuesta sacar un puntos fuertes/débiles. Es un juego que en general nos gusta, es muy entretenido y no se hace nada pesado de jugar. Sin embargo es sumamente largo y requiere bastante despliegue de componentes, mapa, etc. Así que no es fácil de sacar a la mesa.
Es un juego muy completo y que requiere un aprendizaje previo a la hora de disfrutar una partida. Si bien es cierto que una vez lo has jugado, es más fácil de lo que parece. El manual no ayuda, seguramente tendrás que apoyarte en vídeos y gameplays para tenerlo más claro (Mi juego del Mes - Gracias Masivi! :D)
Sin duda un juego para jugones exclusivamente. Es caro. Aporta una buena experiencia de juego pero necesitas casi un día entero.
No es una compra que nos hayamos arrepentido de hacer, pero por la frecuencia con la que vamos a poder jugarlo, a día de hoy habríamos preferido comprar otros juegos. Si genera dudas, es mejor jugarlo antes con alguien.

Natus likes a Konieczka design, details at 11:00.

This is the game FFG has been trying to design for a decade now and they've finally succeeded.  The usual bloat of draw decks and components remains, but after the slow setup the game actually takes off and you can make interesting, meaningful choices.  Still lots of nits to pick, but for once the designer created an interface that doesn't impede the players.  Rating likely to rise.

A fun combination of solid gameplay, theme, and pron, however, it doesn't give me that feel of epic fantasy that War of the ZRing gives.

Also, the hero seems like a sub game that adds a needless layer of chrome and fiddliness to the fame.

Take the role of the classic Human race, the nimble Elves, the beastly Uthick, or the evil Undead, as you attempt to balance conquest, resource management, and defenses, in hopes of gaining six Dragon Runes.  Through the assistance of Heroes (and quests for them), Tactical Cards, Rewards, and Fate, the game can change at the blink of an eye.  Another excellent installment by Fantasy Flight Games!

I really like that this game has the ever-changing board mechanic that keeps things things fresh each time you play.  The season cards are also great in that you never know what effect will be coming up that will change the entire way you (and everyone else) will play the next round.  The heroes sub-game is a nice touch since it's like a game-within-a-game that adds another level of strategy.  This one take a bit a setup but is always a blast every time.

RATING: 7
In this epic big box game, players are attempting to earn 6 dragon rune tokens. The game lasts a maximum of 6 years. Each year, in each of the four seasons, players must decide which card from their 8 card hand to play. Cards allow you to move, recruit and harvest. If you play a higher numbered card than the previous season, you are allowed a bonus. You also control heroes that move around the board to complete quests. There are neutral creatures seeded on the board, and you can attack them or use diplomacy to get them on your side. Attacks, dueling heroes and resolving diplomacy is all done from a draw of cards. 

There are tons of cards and modifiiers, but they all seem to fit together reasonably well into this 4-5 hour game. It is a wargame, and you do have to target your opponents. If you enjoy the fantasy element, have 5 hours to spend, buckle up and enjoy the ride. 

It is a wargame, so you have to be in the mood for attacking, being attacked (sometimes unfairly) and using tactics. It is also a long game, though you are engaged the whole way.

I do think the Season cards can be really swingy, so I've just gone ahead and removed a few of the ones that really annoy me.

**House Rules:**

No Generals. Instead the general trait cards are additional rewards for successful quests, combined with the new hero rules in the second edition.

Every second successful quest gives the character a leadership card they can use in battles in addition to the normal hero effect for heros when fighting from the second edition.

Pros:
Theme & components - Cool map with plastic mountains, modular board, nice standard fantasy feel
Orders - I like the order selection, bonus if done in certain order

Cons:
Combat - Map neutrals are handled strangely, battles are mostly random and too short, one round of combat then totaling number of units doesn't make sense to me, battle deck instead of dice is lame
Victory conditions - abrupt ends, can win without interacting with other players

Runewars is a very good mix of different gaming genres. Those who know Descent will find the heroes of that game in Runewars again. Some might think that playing the heroes is a completely different game, which does not have much to do with the moving armies, but they are linked, which you will notice once you get deeper in the game. The game is well made, the components are of very good quality, as you might be expecting from FFG.

Exceptional. Best true empire builder sim since the original 'Mighty Empires' and it blows even that out of the water.

A joy to play, spectacular visuals, wide array of strategy.

This game is a masterpiece. It loses .5 points simply for the how much you need to cycle the fate deck in 4 players.

Seriously... that's my only gripe with this thing.

RATING: 8.8
And I was just thinking to myself, I should get Runebound.  It's a fantasy exploration game of that old Talisman style, the kind I miss from my childhood.  Man, am I glad I waited a week.  This game obliterates it.

Runewars takes the best parts of a LOT of Fantasy Flight Games -- and a LOT of other games as well -- and jams them together into an interesting area-control wargame with a ton of strategy, a little bit of luck, and no dice.  It's easy to lose focus on the winning conditions, but I saw three hours blow right past me and I was completely engaged in 99.44% of the game.  You're even engaged in the downtime as you watch your opponents battle, trying to strategize where to head next after this battle.

Some of the cards are lopsided.  Some of the extras didn't need to get added.  And it's WAY too expensive.  But all in all, this is a hell of a game here.  Forget Starcraft the Board Game... this is Heroes of Might and Magic right here, or Warlords II.  And it's fantastic.

I think I might be losing my enthusiasm for epic games that come with tons of components.  This is ok, but nowadays I prefer to get my empire building kicks from quicker games like Chaos in the Old World or Imperial 2030.  This just takes too long for the amount of fun it provides.

I've also come to the conclusion that I hate the mechanic of using a deck of cards to resolve everything.

Entertaining mixture of wargame and adventure. All in all, gameplay is AWSOME! It has tactics as well as strategy, various ways to victory and many good ideas. 

The artwork, however, is cheesy, cartoonish and ugly; and unfortunarly, it's set in the super lame Terrinoth world. I also dislike most card based combat resolutions, and Runewars isn't any different. Even the 2nd edition is at a price tag of minimum 60-65 EUR (online retailers), which seems pretty high. If only I could become friends with the graphic design...

RATING: 10
The aspect on Runewars I enjoy the most is its progressive pacing that seems to occur as the seasons pass. Initially each faction is essentially scrambling for a foothold in relative safety, but by years 2 or 3 it quickly becomes apparent this town isn't big enough for everyone. The tension as you push further out of your comfort zone trying to snag just one more rune becomes more and more frantic and by the last year turns usually dissolve into a massive explosion of chaos as everyone throws the kitchen sink into the mix trying to make that final push home to win. A consistently exciting and enjoyable game in my group.

Love the heck out of this game. Hard to sell my wargaming buddies on it though, since it's not a wargame yet looks and acts like one and has the word "war" in the title.

I think this is an easy game to misunderstand, and I blame FFG entirely for this. They have a singular talent for setting the wrong expectations on good games (I'm frowning at you, Android), thereby making good games work harder than they should for fans.

Do heroes "matter"? Yes of course, they're one of the three primary ways you get runes, but they're not military units and don't really interact with the game at that level. So that's weird ... but only if you came to the game expecting that your hero bits "should" be military units.

Does conquest "matter"? Yes of course, but only if the other guy needs to harvest and/or you're taking his runes away from him. But conquest itself is not a path to victory.

I dunno...I think the wheels-within-wheels of this game are pretty great. I like the mass combat system, and sort of wish Twilight Imperium would consider a similar system. I like how Influence works. I like how Heroes work! It all comes together in this interesting pastiche of bits I've seen throughout FFG's catalog. It's like a mix tape of my favorite mechanics that stands on its own, like a good mix tape should. (Anyone younger than 35 will have no idea what I'm on about.)

A big sprawling territorial combat game, but with a twist. There's two games going at once. The heroes wander about fulfilling quests and trying to get more VP tokens. Whilst your armies expand your territory out so you have enough space to hold and protect the VP tokens gained. And/or go conquer someone else's VPs if you can. Tricky though because each unit can only commit to one combat each year, and there's only 6 years - they're armies, not marauders. The problem is that these armies and their combats don't achieve a lot by themselves as a result, just gradual expansion, but the time taken to work through the big battles feels too long for their contribution to the game to warrant. As well as introducing downtime to non-combatants. Although the initiative / card based system is clean, it would have been nicer to resolve these more quickly and get on the with the game. I guess it might result in a loss of epic-ness somehow though. Each to their own. The game is a big effort to learn because there's lots of moving parts (although most are intuitive). I'm just not sure that there's enough immersion and enough interesting decisions to warrant that effort and the time required to play.

I must say, that I was quite surprised by this game. I tend to be more of a Euro player, but I found that the mechanics in this game lead to a smooth and fairly strategic game. There are no dice, instead an event deck that determines quests, skill checks and battles. In addition, you only have eight possible actions each turn, so there is less downtime then on many games of this type. The battles are fast and generally won by the larger army, yet the deck does provide some luck/surprise.

Rating based purely on a play a few years back that was not finished. At the time I remember thinking TI3 appealed to me more, much more in fact. 31/12/14

Ok got to play the revised edition tonight. It was nice but the rulebook is still pretty horrible. Corey really needs to work on cutting the chaff from his designs. 21/3/14

Another play in and I am still not sure. Some of the heroes are OP like the one that can trade in quest cards and the other one that can steal cards from other heroes. The races don't seem overly balanced either. Setup can also dictate who will win. Having two giants for example can easily allow a player to buy them over to their side and smash their opponents. 17/4/15

After my second play I can see some flaws in the game. Not enough to warrant it a bad game but enough to make me want to play it less. TI3 with Shattered Ascension is the better game for me.

I'm usually not a huge fan of multiplayer wargames--especially ones that take forever--but the ease of play of this one drew me in.  In this game you're trying to build up rune tokens instead of directly eliminating opponents, but since these tokens are tied to terrain, conflict will ensue.  Players have a hand of 8 action cards of which they will play 4 every "year", with bonuses given when the cards are played in a particular order.  Each action in itself is pretty simple, so the game doesn't get bogged down in administration.  Combat is card-based, which can get a little clunky.  Overall, probably one of the better epic multiplayer wargames I've played, though not something I'd get to the table very often.

Quite the interesting game. It's like a lighter version of Twilight Imperium that plays well with 2-4 players. I think it's quite fiddly with the cards, but there is a lot to do in this one.

The rules really aren't too bad, but since there is so much stuff going on in it, it makes it much more of a chore than it should be.

Update: Alright, after a second play, I still have some problems with the game. Some of the things in the game seem wildly tacked on. Heroes seem like such an after thought and I feel like you could almost completely remove them without much of a problem. The card play mechanics are nice, but fiddly and I feel like dice would have worked just as well. I still think it's an impressive game, but I feel like the revised edition should have cleaned up a lot of the unnecessary bits.

Although initially a bit complex, Runewars gives a great first impression.  My group even had fun during the set-up.  After a couple of plays, I recommend looking into having some minor house rules.  Luckily, the concept is executed well enough that it's not annoying to change things around.

We'll see if this is 10 material after I sit down with it a few more times.

Fairly good game. An experience similar to Twilight Imperium. Game always take a lot longer to complete than the 180 minutes suggested on this site. Setup and take down are as time consuming as Arkham Horror or Twilight Imperium. Mechanics are simple, but there are a lot of tough decisions to make. I would have liked a better scoring mechanic. I'm not a huge fan of the Dragon Rune system. Game is extremely fiddly but satisfyingly complex.

I like the clever order mechanism a lot, but it gets buried under other not so interesting parts. The game is not for me for a couple of reasons: Long setup and gameplay. Races don't differ enough. Quest part of the game is random and not interesting at all. Card randomized combat is less exciting than dice one and there isn't a lot of dynamic in territory control.

I REALLY like Runewars' take on DOAM, combining adventure (questing), player-driven setup, and a great order selection/resolution mechanic. In fact, there's so much stuff in this game that listing all the stuff I thought was great would take too long. The Fate deck is awesome, the title mechanic is really awesome, the resource dials are awesome, etc. The Hero Questing does take a bit too long, though, especially when people may have up to three heroes. I still like it, though! I'm only saying it's too long because I have to hear people complain about it.

RATING: 10
Certainly one of my favorite thematic games. A heavy themed Area Control strategy game with a lot of different things going on. I see myself playing this as often as I can manage. Some real memorable moments in Runewars. Lots of interesting decisions with an epic atmosphere. 

I can see why some may not be enamored with it, but for me it hits all the right buttons. I believe that some of the complaints people have about this game simply have not given it a fair shake. I find most of the complaints simply untrue. There is conflict through war and the heroes are integral and important to the game. I think people just went in with preconceived notions about what this game is and came away disappointed that it didn't match their notions. Definitely a 10. Even if the title of the game is a bit of a misnomer.

My only concern is that the number of plays will stay low. Since it seems like one of those games that will be hard to get to the table. Not because it's bad, but because it's large, has a bit of setup, and the fantasy theme might turn off some of my players. I'm sure it will see more plays per year than Twilight Imperium 3rd edition though.

edit: game is still awesome, but it is hard to get to the table. Played it more than TI3 though or HIS!

edit: one of my favorite games, but very difficult to get to the table. Since it has been collecting dust for awhile, I decided to sell it, seeing as it would probably be years before I got a chance to play it again.

edit: I wish there was a digital version of this game. That said I think Star wars Rebellion has replaced this.

RATING: 8
The game was easy to learn and just as easy to play. I considered many times before I bought this and finally I'm just very glad I did buy this.

The game works great with 2 players. Soon I'll try it with the other numbers. Our first game was tight and awesome. It needs more playing to understand the strategies of all four unique factions. The first game took something like 2-3h with all the rules checking and stuff, so I think it'll be squeezable to 2h.

The only downside was the price, considered how very little you get for that money. But still, since this will probably be a game to be played a lot for me, it's tolerable. I just don't understand why this is a big box game, since a lot smaller would've sufficed. Probably for expansions then.. can't think of anything else.
Oh and speaking of expansions: more of this, YES PLEASE.

Edit1: This game definitely has a potential for 10.

4X without too much of the exploration part.  This game is quick and engaging, but still takes a good 3 hours of your life to get through.  What makes this game interesting is the amount of depth in strategic options and how the game limits how far you can expand with its winter mechanics and discard piles.

This isn't a wargame in the traditional sense, this is a take-and-hold game based purely around having enough territory that you can safely protect your win conditions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was hoping for more of a wargame, I think, or more of a territory-building & resource collection game.  It was all in there, but somehow muddied and diluted.  

I wish there was more of a strategic connection between the heroes and the armies.  It would be nice if you at least had to clear a path before your heroes could get in.  It felt like Secret Agent Laser Obstacle Chess, like 'WTF'?  Couldn't they tie those two elements together better?

I was also disappointed with the lack of difference between different types of units.  Those special powers hardly ever came into play.  It didn't seem like the harder-to-get units really did anything special for you.

I liked the map-building aspect though.  I felt like that was the beginning of something interesting.  I felt like you could make some interesting initial placements for better resources, better access to your quests, etc.  I just wish the rest of the game had lived up to that potential.

I think I really wanted this to feel like Shogun with a fantasy theme.

The first thing you'll notice is how amazing everything looks. The components are durable and beautifully decorated.  The small cards are actually flexible, making them easy to shuffle (unlike Arkham horror's cards).  The units have great sculpts.  I love the resource dials.  Everything has the 'weave' design.  The game has excellent play value, because there is so much going on: you have resource management, empire building, hero questing, neutral unit negotiations, and other things like dealing with the wizard's council with influence.  The order cards are sooo fun to pick out, planning your year's moves in advance and having to sometimes change your plan based on how the seasons of the year pan out.  The amount of strategy involved is amazing.  Well worth getting.

Wow, My favorite game ever, it has too many way to play it and win, it's possible to play it every weeks whitout being bored. Its one of the only game that include heroes, quests, ressources gathering, development, politics and war that i know. 

If you like to invest time in a game (rules and hours of play) you must buy it.

Light-ish Fantasy war game with (thankfully) not many dry, overwrought Euro mechanics that plague many of Fantasy Flight's games.

The Euro mechanic is in the order cards: On your turn, you pick from one of eight order cards that you cannot use again for the current year (there are four turns per year). Depending on the order in which you play your order cards, you may receive some bonus.

I say light-ish since strategically -- it takes maximum 2h to finish a game -- the game is straightforward but there are a lot of fiddly moving parts in the form of special action cards of a multitude of types that are acquired in a multitude of ways. It's unfortunate that a game this light has a relatively steep learning curve. The poorly written and organized rules don't help either.

I also appreciated the easily resolved combat mechanism, meaning that there is no card-based combat like the new Dungeon Quest that simply wastes time.

This is the only fantasy battle game you'll ever need.  The game is simply gorgeous to look at and the components are top notch (I was surprised at the small size of the figures, but they are still very well sculpted). I like that there are multiple paths to victory and that it isn't all fighting.  I think the heroes are very well implemented.  They can definitely contribute to victory, but are not the focus of the game.  The game is not overly complex rules-wise, but has enough depth that it will take a few plays to explore the different strategies available.  If you're expecting a fight to the finish you may be disappointed.  You must keep an eye on who is getting runes and how, as the winner is not necessarily the one with the most military might.

A big "meh" for me.  I wanted to like it, but its just a little too random for me, especially considering its length. Most of the mechanics are just lifted from other FF games. The cards are really random and swingy.  Will pass on replays.

RATING: 9
It might be slightly heavy on the rules, but it is explainable in about 30-45 minutes. After a runthrough, the game runs smoothly and there isnt alot questions about the rules. this usually means that the rules kinda logicialy explains itself. 

I would thou reccomend this as a 4 player game. The interaction is great. maby slightly slow during the summer period, but other than that, its is a great game. I am lookin forward until the next playthrough of the game.

After two games I felt Runewars was another overwrought Corey K game - too many cards, overlong diceless combat and some prolonged mechanics (quests) that had me tapping my fingers.

After our third game, I felt my deck knowledge and decision making improved and so did the game. Enough variety to bring me back and I'm continuing to learn how best to grab those runes - which, for me, is generally with the heroes. 

UPDATE: I think the full "alternative" game starting with 1 and winning with 7 runes is required to try and get the player's thumping each other rather than relying on lucky rune collection. The downside to this is the game takes a fair bit longer to play, as combat player v player strings things out.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite games, though I do recognize it's not the greatest game by any means.

I really like the dynamic in this game which I have never seen done before.  You're given hero(es) and armies.  Your hero is tasked with questing, which will most likely result in finding dragon runes.  Your army is tasked with both protecting the dragon runes you have found and possibly trying to claim your opponent's dragon runes.  Gaining a certain amount of dragon runes will win you the game.

The good:
The game has a very original dynamic and feel.
The game is nail-biting thematic, especially for hero fights.
A lot of the mechanics in this game aren't really seen anywhere else in the thematic board gaming world.

The bad:
Extremely long game, especially for how random it can be.
Very random (though there is randomness mitigation).
Lots of down time when playing with 3, and especially with 4.
Game end can come very suddenly (when playing without the new rule modifications).  For a really lengthy game, for it to just end very unexpectedly, can be a real deal breaker for some people.

Overall, I recommend this game if you like lengthy thematic games.  Good luck trying to find another person willing to play.

Runewars, Runewars... *clucks tongue* I loved you when I first purchased you from the now defunct Boards & Bits several years back. In your enormous coffin box, since replaced by a more reasonable sized container in the new edition. Your vast, empty confines with your plastic mountains and tiny army miniatures. Your seasonal events and awkward hero mechanics. The glazed look on the eyes of everyone I've explained this game to, your relatively small number of plays despite the intimidating shadow you cast over my game room with your enormity.

Runewars, you're not a bad game, you're actually kind of interesting. But grand fantasy military engagements are not what you're made of. Perhaps a few, pivotal and decisive engagements before a winner becomes apparent. I doubt you'll see much more play, moldering on your place on top of my shelves (because you are far too large to go [i]in[/i] the shelves), and I'll never trade you (because the postage would bankrupt us). You stand as a warning about impulse buys, a cautionary tale and a remnant of the early golden age of hobby gaming where giant boxes filled with plastic were still part and parcel of the hobby.

This game gets better and better with every play.
I like the whole system a lot. I hate rolling dice in 4X games (because it is so luck based for what you have planned hours ahead) still it uses cards and you always need a little bit luck to activate your units with it.

While i am missing a little bit the politics phase from TI and the runeboundish hero phase is only a neat way to get victory points, i would still play this over TI now (because it doesnt take forever to play).

Edited to 5. Almost needs epic game to get to see all the features. If you are not afraid of a long game, this might be it. The groups I've played all had at least one player who lost intrest, witch is of course devastating to game and could reflect to my given score.

The seasonal action system is brilliant. Lots of strategic depth to the selection and timing of these actions. The heroic quest sub-system hangs together well. And for such a big game, it doesn't overstay its welcome.

On the downside, the game does end just when things are heating up militarily. And there's a lot of luck in the draw of the special goals. 

Of course, it's massively overproduced and rife with dozens of decks. But with FFG you know that going in.

So far every game that Corey has designed I have thoroughly enjoyed playing and I am sure he'll do a fantastic job on this title. Just need to be patient as we wait for the release.

Had our first game, 3 player, and we really enjoyed it, not to many issues with the rules. Look forward to the next.

Have played 2 more games both 4 player and enjoy it more each time. All the different races have their strength and weakness's and I look forward to trying out all the races eventually.

Good game, if you like that type of games.

It's a good game for expand and conquer, but takes a bit long for the fun we had. Also, it's easy to take on the strongest player, making it one of those games "it's best to be second".
Personaly I feel like "hero part" of the game is game for itself, and that tactic cards are a bit unpredictible.
Combat seems like it has lot of options and strategy at first, but after a few plays I didn't feel that different unit types bring alot to the table.

Played only a few times, it might improve with more plays

--Jan2010-- Better than I'd expected - and I'd hoped it'd be reasonable.  I like the asymmetric set of factions; the minis are well-designed (if minimal) and clear; the dynamics of play interesting.  Happy to play again.
--Nov2010-- After 7 plays, I'm quite enthusiastic.  Our games have been entertaining tense affairs that neither overlast their welcome nor present periods of downtime.  The leaders have been significant; the random factors manageable; the story reasonable.  Excellent design. (And yet, that said, I still think the "mountains" are dorky.)

Epic game that brings you into fantasy world known from Descent, Runebound. Very complex but ideal for strategic players. No place for luck here, only wise decisions will get you the victory. Two disadvantages that needs to be mentioned - 3-4h time needed to play 4 ppl match, plus .... only 4 ppl. I would not recommend this to casual player as this is though one, but if you are really into some serious boardgames (like me!) then you will like it a lot

A very good game. Compared to my other point of reference (Starcraft) for big FFG games with many plastic pieces, it is much more accessible because you don't need to plan out a path of development (which requires knowledge of how the different Starcraft technologies interact). Instead, you are responding to the cards you receive (Quest, Objective, Season and Tactical Cards), and thus it is a much more tactical game than Starcraft (which is more strategic). The influence auctions and heroes add another layer of competition which means the game is not all about conquest. The fact that you need to accommodate the runes, however, in a conquered territory means that there is a quite subtle interaction between the different elements of questing (heroes), conquest (armies) and politics (influence actions). The seasonal events are an excellent method of propelling the action, meaning you can't just sit back and turtle, and add a great deal of variety. The orders system packs much of the foreplanning of Starcraft into a much swifter and easier to teach mechanism that creates a lot of tension.

My only complaints are that I would have preferred having a whole order card devoted to moving heroes rather than just have them all move in summer; this way you would really have a clearer choice between a military and questing route to victory. The ending can also be somewhat anticlimatic, but that's mainly if the players aren't keeping track of who's been picking up the runes. Those who dislike chance disrupting their best-laid plans should also avoid, but personally I find this highly thematic and plausible.

Sold on e-bay.

I *really* like Runewars because, unlike most "conquest" games, it has additional ways to obtain the "dragon runes" you need to win the game, so the game doesn't drag like too many "conquest" games do. 

Additionally, the "role selection" mechanics are a nice addition to the usual conquest game fare, and Influence tokens add some resource management chrome to the game.

Terrific at some things, and unbelievably frustrating in others. I loved the whole resources system, and the system or orders and rewards was terrific. On the other hand, the card-based combat is irritating in that it essentially over-complicates something that is very simple. And the heroes never seem to gel as something integral to the game. Still, I very much enjoyed it. I'd play this one again.

I was very disappointed with this game. This game has loads of potential, unfortunately for me it falls flat in many areas. Pretty much every critical review on here seems to hit the nail on the head for me as to what I don't like about this game. This game is poorly refined and has many awkward rules and game mechanics that don't seem to have a point or suit the theme.

The whole goal of the game is to obtain Dragon Runes. The runes ultimately serve as a mechanic to create conflict between player armies. I found it disappointing that there is no game play benefit for possessing these runes. The concept of Dragon Runes doesn't add much substance to the game, their implementation feels generic and tacked on and doesn't add anything to the theme. 

There are many aspects to this game that seem to be rather abstract and lacking polish. Combat is one-dimensional, each unit figure receives only one opportunity to attack during a combat round. This limits the amount of punishment and badassery any one unit can dish out; which I find to be rather anticlimactic. So the killer dragon you recruit has a huge chance of never even dealing damage in combat (and that's if you manage to get it to the front lines). The one round combats wouldn't be so bad if a battle would last more than one season. It would add to the epic theme of the game if a battle had the potential to last through the spring to fall or even longer. It could give you the opportunity to send reinforcements to the front lines. So many tactical options could become available if the game devs would have tweaked the combat system just a little.

Ultimately, aside from the many convoluted rules, underdeveloped themes, and weak combat mechanics, it is a pretty and fun game. To me many aspects of this game just fall flat and leave me wanting more.

My favorite epic game. Even in the 'epic' variant (I don't play the standard game which is too short) plays under 5-6 hours, which is the most I'm prepared to spend on a single game. A lot is going on in this game, and while in Warrior Knights all that chrome detracted from the war on the map, here the balance between all the mechanics is just right for me. Not very much a thinking & diplomacy game like Game of Thrones is, it strides into adventure game territory where you play as much for living the story as for winning.

RATING: 7
I found one 4 player, 5 hour play of this (epic rules, expansion included) extremely enjoyable, although I have a few reservations about replayability. Only fully realized the importance of questing towards the end of the game (a common mistake I understand); the randomness here, that one player could feasibly get 3 runes through the course of the game (or more?) whilst the others keep drawing nothing but duds has the potential of making a sideshow of everything else. If a player doesn't need to attack to get Runes then they could probably turtle with great effect. Nonetheless, it was great fun, I pretty much liked how all the various mechanisms played - simultaneous action selection, the dilemma of choosing action order, card combat, and so on. As is often the case with FFG, the mechanisms were all half familiar from other games - elements here of Game of Thrones, the first Warcraft boardgame, Runebound-in-miniature, Starcraft TBG simplified: For me, this is a great mix. I am very likely to swallow my reservations and spring for the reprint when it comes out, even if it only ends up seeing play once every year or so.

Another example of overproduction not sustained in the depth or even in the needs of the game mechanics, but to justify and oversized price.  Even so, an OK game.  By the way, it looks like somebody told the FFG's staff that combat resolutions using dice mechanics aren't cool, even when they really are.  It is easier to plan with the cards and the results are somehow fairer, but the twist of the possibilities using dice are simply incomparable.

8.5.10 -  (1 play) Quite an involved game that is a lot of fun. Took quite a while to play our first game. Liked it a lot and am looking forwad to playing again soon.

8.6.10 - (2 plays) Runewars has solid mechanics, great components and some neat ideas. I enjoy the game but feel like there is really too much game there. It's a bit fiddly in places (moving minis around for battles), the bidding rather annoyed me, and I'd prefer to roll dice over drawing resolution cards, but overall it's a solid game. Not as crazy about it as I thought I'd be, and I kinda doubt I'll end up getting my own copy like I'd planned on doing. Would still be happy to play it again though.

2.19.13 - (3 plays) It's fun, but our 4 player game just took 5 hours. I like the game but I probably won't ever take the time to play this one again. Too bad the revised edition didn't make the game a little more playable (to my tastes). This game showed me that I really dislike blind bidding. 

I think I'd enjoy the game more if it had no blind bidding, face up runes, more than one rune to a space, and a simplified Conquest of Nerath dice type battle mechanic.

Al hablar de juego épico, Runewars debería ser uno de los 2-3 juegos que se nos viniera a la cabeza. Toda una experiencia de gestión de imperios, aventuras y confrontación militar.

Dentro de que es un juego complejo (30-45 minutos de explicación) y largo (3-4 horas de partida, más si se juega a 4 jugadores), no es tan complejo y largo como puede parecer por la cantidad de material que trae la mastodóntica caja de la 1ª edición.

Un gran juego.

RATING: 9
A bloated monster of a game. It lacks the one brilliant idea in Corey's other works like Battlestar Galactica (skill checks) and Middle-Earth Quest (life/damage/rest pools), but is remarkable for how it glues the kitchen sink together. The rules are extremely simple, basically resolve a random event for everybody, then everybody play an action simultaneously, but layered complexity makes decisions tough.

Nearly every area-influence, conquest game you can think of is here in some form. Exploration from Nexus Ops, blitzing from Axis & Allies, building and upkeep in Shogun, plus the threat of getting hit before you can exploit. And of course, A Game of Thrones appears to be the mechanical inspiration.

Still, a little too bloated, with all kinds of tiny cards lying around the table, some confusing rules exceptions, and weird dynamics (especially with a bad map) where the game can sometimes end before the battles get going. Battles can be weird -- losing a battle is harsh, but the game gives the advantage to the attacker, creating a lot of weird I-have-to-attack-lest-he-attacks-me dilemmas, which take getting used to. Not a fan of the Fate Deck, since it's very fiddly to pass it around a big table, and is a lot of work just to simulate fancy die rolls.

Two separate mini-games, with the army battles in one arena and heroes/adventure in the other, with limited, card-driven ways to interact between them. The heroes/adventure element is not fully fleshed out (move here to complete quest, boom, rinse, repeat), and can feel like a burden on the game sometimes when you have to spend 15 minutes every game year on the Quest Phase. Though it does provide a nice respite. Mixed feelings about it, but definitely would have preferred a way for heroes to lead in battle.

Lots of tiny annoyances, but you cannot beat the sheer epic scale of pushing dudes around and colliding in big battles. The highs are awesome and allow me to overlook the lows.

A nice set of simple positive changes with the Revised Edition. Heroes are more mobile, making their abilities better and questing easier and more important. It, combined with heroes' leadership in battle, provides a simple way to increase interaction between heroes and armies, far better than the contrived Commanders module in the expansion. Road to Victory was sorely necessary. Defaulting everything to Epic Variant now really increases game length, but I do like that rune tokens start outside, encouraging early aggro and making the Commander of the Warriors Guild title better early-game.

Still prefer the expansion (and playing base again made me re-appreciate it), but I no longer mind just playing base. Bump from 8 to 9.

Note to self: play to fewer dragon runes in future. 1ed was 6 years to gain 4 w/o Road to Victory, while Revised Ed changed it to 7 years to gain 6 + Road to Victory. Think can easily scale it down to 4 or 5. Encourages conflict too.

Base: 4+5
 + BoW: 4+5

RATING: 7
[2 plays] I liked this. It is nicely produced, has some nice mechanisms, and feels like a cross between Nexus Ops and Warrior Knights. I will definitely play it again. The complicated decision tree that develops with so many different card types in hand after a while will scare away casual gamers - or at least it should. Runewars seems like it will probably always absorb the entire evening. Our first game went 90+ minutes for the rules and set-up, and then finished in the third out of six years, after about 3.5 hours of play. I'm not convinced the game really needs the hero component, but I'm also not convinced it would be satisfyingly superior to Nexus Ops without it in terms of game length/enjoyment ratio.

Most recent play 4/19/13.

The definite ameritrash fantasy strategy. This is the game to play if you liked the PC classics Heroes of M&M and Warlords. The components are high quality and the game looks just right when set up. Basiclly the rules are quite straightforward, but with quite many little things to remember a bit too busy for my tastes. Resource management and the battle system both are solid as a rock.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A fun game, lots of interesting components and strategies.  The order choosing system is more interesting than I expected - choosing a higher order to sacrifice future supremacy bonuses is something you really have to consider.  The combat is an interesting combination of luck and risk management - and done in a way that really couldn't be fully captured by dice.

Definitely worthy of the ranks of Twilight Imperium 3 and others of the higher-end Fantasy Flight games.

The more I play this game, the more I want to play "just one more time, I promise". :)

RATING: 6
When I bought Rune Wars I was told that it would be a simpler, faster, and more streamlined experience than Twilight Imperium set in a Fantasy setting. While this statement is exactly what I got I was not impressed with Rune Wars. Rune Wars has a combat system that does not resonate with me or my group too well making it a rare play at best for us. TI had a great combat system but was lacking in the other areas, Rune Wars is the opposite, but it's still not enough to push us into playing it over TI.

I have moved my initial ranking of this game up to a 10. The more I play this game, the more subtle strategies I discover. I enjoy the strategy behind it, the different ploys you can try to win the game, and the back stabbery that the nations must undertake to win. 

I thoroughly enjoy the combat mechanic of the game. The only downside in my opinion is the common complaint of the fate deck. It gets old and somehow. I can't help but think dice would have been a better choice. That observation notwithstanding, the way the fate deck works and has been implemented for multiple mechanics in the game is very clever.

Egy újabb fantasy nagyágyút sikerült kipróbálni a Descent, Mage Knight vonalból. Mindkettőre hasonlít sok téren, van egy kis Stracraft rész is benne, de annyira nem nyűgözött le. Nézzük a pozitívumokat. Nagyon jó az erőforrásmenedzsment rész a játékban. Három nyersanyag különböző mértékű birtoklása mind a játékban játszható 4 fajt különböző előnyökhöz juttatja. A négy játszható faj nagyon jól kiegyenlített, igaz nem sok lényeges különbség van köztük, de jól eltaláltak. Tetszett a harcrendszer is mind a kártyás megoldás, mind az egységek jól eltalált fajtája és azok száma. Alapvetően akciókártyákat játszunk ki, különböző értékekkel, amelyek közül a kisebb számú kerül először sorra. Ebben semmi újdonság nincs, sok játékban megjelenik. Érdekesség, hogy minden kártyának van másodlagos képessége, ami akkor kerül végrehajtásra, ha nincs nála nagyobb számú kártya kijátszva. Ez jó kis ötlet. A játékban két dolog nem tetszik. Az egyik a cél elérése. Hat sárkányrúna birtoklása a saját területünkön. Ez ha megvan be kell jelenteni és egy évig tartani. Egy év négy körből áll. Nagyon sokféleképpen lehet rúnákhoz jutni, de sajnos sok az olyan eset is, amikor vesztünk belőlük. A játék végén már sokszor egy-egy jó kártya dönt, hogy sikerül-e tartani vagy nem. És akkor itt jön a játék nálam legnagyobb hibája a szerencsefüggősége. Mindenhol megjelenik. A csatakártyáknál még csak-csak tolerálható, de sok helyen már zavaró. A hősök az egységektől teljesen függetlenül mozognak a terepen és könnyedén szerezhetnek szerencsével rúnákat, míg mások elhalnak egy-egy küldetés nehézsége miatt. Egysíkú a játékmenet, minél több egység gyártása, kulcsterületek bevédése és a végén bízni a szerencsében, hogy meg tudjuk tartani őket a rúnáink számára. Nem rossz játék a Runewars, de nekem a Mage Knight jobban bejött és a Descent is változatosabb.

Epic! This game sort of reminds me of what Warcraft III (the computer game) would be in board game form: Asymmetrical armies, Heroes, Neutral units, etc

[b]P.S.[/b] Rating is with expansion. Promotes more conflict around the map, and differentiates the races more than what they are in the base game. When I play Revised edition, it will likely retain same rating for also promoting more conflict around the map.

My favorite area control game after Go, thanks to awesome fantasy-theme wargame layer.  So many decisions to make around which order to play now vs later, where to expand, where to attack or defend.  It does run long, and have to accept some randomness, but totally engaging the whole time.  It would be very close to a 10 if not so fiddly, but i have a low tolerance for that, so might not bother others as much.

Great game. I dont know, why people complain about the balance of races. I won with every race so far and dont think they are very unbalanced. it is more depending on the map and the placement of home realms. Usually the Starting player has a tough time, unfortunately.

I only gave 9 points, because it can be pretty long, especially with the 2nd edition/errata. last game took almost 8 h and the winner got only 5 runes. The reason was the 5-8 fights each year i guess. (most players were noobs too).

Nevertheless a great game, that combines nice turnbased strategy with economy, alliances and battles. i absolutely recommend for friends of this genre.

RATING: 6.5
Неоднозначные впечатления. Коробка слишком велика (не люблю неразумно больших коробок), деталей масса, но они красочны и приятны. Механика специфична: стратегическая игра, чем то похожая на Игру Престолов, но в то же время и приключенческая игра, где герои собирают артефакты, котрые в последствии могут дать руны (цель игры - 6 рун в своих владениях). Механика боя также неоднозначна - лично я не понимаю зачем была введена колода боевых карт, когда фактически она имитирует кубики (после обнаружил несколько причин, которые можно считать адекватными: чтобы не увеличивать размер поля, можно запоминать карты, вышедшие в отбой и так рассчитывать вероятность).
Баланс странный :), некоторые фракции получили изначально преимущество, но в силу того, что любой дисбаланс на стратегической карте может быть нивелирован умными действиями героев и проигрывая в сражениях можно очень даже собрать заветные 6 рун (теми же героями), то могу принять таким, каков есть. Кстати, мне достался недокомплект без листа с некоторыми гексами (игровое поле), отчего большой привет дорогому FFG. НО по первому же обращению выслали недостающие компоненты (за счет FFG), за что - респект американцам!

В итоге - 5 баллов за атмосферность, 4 за стратегию, 2 - за недокомплектность (в моём конкретном случае, у других тоже есть странные для такой игры ошибки, но на 4, в моем случае - 2!). Общее впечатление: 4 балла. В свете реакции на недокмплект FFG поднимаю до 4.5.

I have only had one 3 player game. The initial tile set up hampered me greatly, virtually locking me into my own kingdom and only being able to venture out in the winter.  Accordingly the game fell flat for me.

The heroes seemed ancillary to the main game and seemed like a sub game to the main event.  Tons of cards to keep an eye on and components everywhere.  Everything felt a little disjointed and the various mechanics seemed tacked on.

I have been looking forward to playing this for a while and it didn’t disappoint.  FFG simply knows how to fill certain itches and this is no exception.  It has enough diversity for good replayability.  Lots of randomness with the set-up and the races are different enough to allow a diversity of strategies and it makes me want to play it again just by writing about it.  My biggest complaint is not the gameplay but the price and the box.  Yes the components are nice, but the quantity of what you get is dwarfed by the box and really, the only reason I can see for such is big box is to put it in the "big box" $100 category.  Simply ridiculous.

After further plays I have to downgrade this one.  It is like there are three games here going on at once.  There is the world domination game, the runebound-ish hero game, and then the hard to define runestone game.  There seems to be little correlation from any of these to the other.  In a 3 hour game the Winner is the person who happens upon the most runestones or gets lucky with an event or vote.  I have soured on this considerably.

Runewars is essentially Twilight Imperium light with an adventure game smeared over the top of it.  That doesn't make it that light.

It is really a very good game.  Dudes on a Map games are my favorite genre, and this is one of the best ones ever made.  It works very well with two players, which is good.  Everyone familiar with it, except Fantasy Flight realizes it could benefit from a 5-6 player expansion.  It is very well made game, with quite a bit of strategic depth and good implementation of theme.

I don't mind losing, but I think at certain points my repeated bone-headed mistakes were frustrating the poor moderator.  I'll stick to face to face on this one in the future.

I was a bit nervous buying Runewars before the mountain of reviews that are sure to come, but I took a leap of faith and after two play, I'm glad I did. I wouldn't call it TI3 'lite" but it certainly pushes the Twilight Imperium buttons without devoting 10 hours to a game. With experienced players, I can see this becoming an 'epic area control' game of around 3 hours. If I have the time, I'd still opt for TI3, but Runewars is extremely impressive.

I would have LOVED this game 10 years ago.  But now, this beast is just showing its age.  This is a great game for those who have the time and patience to devote several hours to a fantasy civ experience, but these days I just find myself looking for much quicker and more streamlined games.  The physical components are off the charts and are certainly a throwback to the glory days of massive, plastic-filled game boxes.  But in terms of the game play, while it wasn't horrible, by the end of the game I was feeling relieved that it was over.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 6/10

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I had low expectations for this game.  I have disliked other FFG wargames and expected this to follow suit.  However, I was plesantly surprised.  The pace of the game felt quick.  The rules were not too difficult to pick up quickly.  I enjoyed the order system, the theme, and how stream-lined the combat was.  This game just seemed to flow and progress vs when I play something like Twilight Imperium feels slow and tedious to me.  Not perfect, but decent.  I disliked the wide variey in the cards..some seemed very good and game changing.. others worthless.  I felt like the game was at least partial decided on card drawing rather than good play.  Also, maybe because I was a new player but, my hero didn't do or get anything useful the whole game.  Nothing he did seemed to help or hurt me getting any runes, he was like in a different game.  Overall I would play this game again for sure.  I did enjoy it.  At this point I would not pay retail price to buy and own it though.

RuneWars è un gioco da tavolo epico di diplomazia, combattimento e cerche per 2- 4 giocatori. Progettato da Corey Konieczka, RuneWars mette a confronto i giocatori in una sfida strategico di battaglie e di controllo di spazi vitali, dove devono raccogliere le risorse, riunire le loro armate e assediare città molto fortificate. RuneWars include oltre duecento carte magnificamente illustrate e altrettanti segnalini, così come oltre duecento miniature di plastica finemente dettagliate, anche se il punto di forza del gioco rimangono le mappe esagonali componibili. Presentando elementi tridimensionali in rilievo, le mappe assicurano che nessuna partita sia uguale alle altre.

RuneWars è ambientato nello stesso universo fantasy del noto gioco da tavolo Runebound e di Descent: Viaggi nelle Tenebre, e molti eroi e mostri ben conosciuti dai fan dell’ambientazione fanno qui il loro ritorno.
Le guerre per le rune dei draghi sono cominciate e solo una fazione sarà vittoriosa!

Elenco elementi di gioco:
36 Unità Neutrali in plastica di colore beige

Fun game with a lot of theme and flavor. Unfortuantely, there are a few mechanisms which I find pull the game down in comparison to something like Twilight Imperium III.

The whole hero going around doing quests is neat, but really distant from everything else that is going on. They move separately, act separately, and are completely split from everything else. Just feels like it was tacked on to make it fit in the Runescape universe.

Also, the items that heroes get are all over the place. Some are completely useless, while others are potential runes (and thus victory points). If someone manages to get nothing but runes through items, while another person gets other things, it can really hurt the game.

Finally, the "Objectives" are grossly imbalanced. Taking 7 hexes outside of your home base takes easily the entire game, while getting 2 Giants to join your side, or getting a hex next to an enemy base is relatively easy in comparison.

If only the game was better balanced and gave you more avenues to win outside of getting lucky with items or objectives, I think the game would be a lot better.

Still, I thought it was fun, and I definitely want to play it again!

Epic and random fantasy conquest game. Players take the roll of one of four factions (Humans, Elves, Undead and Uthuk), all of which play slightly differently from one another, in an attempt to conquer regions containing dragon runes. As the game progresses and more regions are conquered by a faction, the stronger they become due to a greater number of resources. Each turn consists of an order selection, which allows a certain action to take place e.g. movement, engage in conflict, reinforce etc. There is also a nice feature whereby factions have heroes who operate independently of their armies and attempt to complete quests in return for rewards. Overall 'Runewars' is an impressive game with a lot of commendable features (I particularly like the combat system which involves drawing cards and referring to symbols based on the units involved for results) but I do feel that there is one level of randomness too many here and too often has "I've got this card which..." moments, resulting in the game feeling far too dependant on luck.

Played only once. I really don't like the way battles are resolved and the fact that there are so many rules for the heroes. The expansion sorts out the second issue but the first issue remains.

Even more awesome than I thought it would be. Has everything I have always wanted in a game and even more. Bravo Mr. Konieczka! I still don't get the comments about heroes being disconnected from the game - they are one of the best ways to get the dragon runes and can find pretty funny things like a Dragon Throne or a Portal. Thematically, they fit perfectly. You still complain they can't lead armies? They are adventurers, not military commanders.

Too bad the races aren't more different and that it supports 4 players max.

The first time I played Runewars, it was at a friend's place, and I wasn't entirely sure that this was my type of game. It was long, seemed fiddly and complicated - one of those confrontational games where someone else who knows better would just pound your armies to the ground. War games just aren't my thing.

And then, after the game, I found that I actually rather enjoyed it! I read a little more about the design ideas behind Runewars; the designer had wanted to capture the sort-of Macro/Micro feel of a fantasy story. Like LotR where you have armies of elves, humans and orcs clashing with each other, while on a micro-level, individual hobbits and heroes try to complete their missions which could affect the whole thing.

I really like Runewars, and I will handily teach and play it anytime.

Outstanding. I've only dry-run this but I am drooling for a proper game. So many new mechanics, so much changes from one game to another.
Can't give it the 10 that I'm sure it deserves until I play it, but I'll be amazed if it doesn't live up to expectation.
Edit 28.03.10.Played 4p yesterday and it was very good - so much going on. I didn't realise how fidlly the rules were though with quite a few situations cropping up where we had to adjudicate before looking up Q&A's. However great game - good fun, love the element of surprise that Tactics cards can give you, and hopefully next time we could get the time down to something more reasonable (4.5 hrs 1st go), but stays as a Nine for now...

RATING: 7
I found this to be pretty interesting. Small quibble involves some of the goal cards and some of the tactics cards being much better than others, but other than this bit of imbalance the game is very engaging. The foam mountain and troop sculpts are quite nice, giving the game an epic feel. The battles are interesting and not overly complicated or long, which is a flaw that can ruin a game of this scale. Now that I've struggled through a first game, I need to play this again to see where my rating settles in.

Fantasy combat game with some eurogame elements added. Sort of "TI3 lite" with a focus on combat. The shorter playing time is a plus in my book. Interesting decisions to make, although I would rather the game were a little less complex. This game has the classic FFG treatment - their standard artwork style, tons of different cards, very nice plastic minis, long rulebook. I personally love the 3D mountains - nice touch. Did I mention the great minis? No trash in this "Ameritrash."

It's largely a mish-mash of mechanics from other FFG titles that Corey K has worked on (Twilight Imperium's activation of hexes, Warrior Knights' fate cards, A Game of Thrones' supply and Storm of Swords' cities, Death Angel's setting order for player actions).  Still, it manages to distinguish itself enough from its older siblings to keep it from being redundant.

RATING: 9
I am not so sure on how to rate this yet. I probably experienced one of the worst swings of bad luck I ever had in a boardgame. And though this event (which actually was a chain of events) is very unlikely, I am not so happy with the fact that the game permits this. Admittedly. there was a risk, but it was a very low one. However the effects were desastrous. 

Example: Humans with one cavalry and a fortress in their realm (Me, as the Orc attacking with 7 units, 3 Berserkers, 2 flesh rippers, and 2 chaos demons), fresh deck of fate cards. My flesh rippers fail to kill him, so the cavalry gets to attack and draws - guess what - one of two of the "Route 2"- cards in the deck of 30. 
Ok, I kill his cavalry but have to retreat since my strength of 5 only equals his. 
All my retreated units are routed. But since I didn't capture the stronghold the human - who played recruit that round - was now able to place armies in the fortress which should have been mine) and on the next turn plays a Tactics-card with which he picks up a beforehand played Conquest- or Mobilize-order (he had played both beforehand) card, thus now being able to attack my routed army (which has retreated into a stronghold region of my own) Due to the fact that he was attacked by another player (in a region where he already had an activation marker) and retreated from that fight, he was able to play yet another powerful card with which to place routed armies back to normal. And since these armies were not in an activated region anymore they were also able to join the fight against me. So not only did I not have a massive army and two strongholds in that (those two) regions, but ended up with an almost completely wiped out army and no stronghold. 
I know this is all written very confusing. It's just to give you a clue on the chain of negative events that did spoil my first experience with this game a little. However I still want to try this game again because I am convinced, I actually will enjoy it, because in the end this game has everything I like.  

Rating will probably go up.

Upate #1 from 6.5 to 7.5 - keep it coming. It's growing on me. 

Third game in - I like it more and more: 8.0

This is an epic fantasy game mechanically similar to Twilight Imperium but better realized. Thanks to the theme, terrain tiles are more varied (deserts, forests, volcanoes etc), very beautiful and have interesting obstacles like rivers that freeze in winter and can be crossed. Map setup is vastly superior as it can produce realms of any shape and cleverly balances starting positions. The game flows much better than TI because of new resource and unit recruitment system, which eliminates a lot of upkeep, simultaneous selection of actions via cards (a la RftG) and reducing the amount of troop movement (you can activate at most 2 sectors per year, and game lasts only 6 years). Winning condition (obtaining dragon runes) also has more logic than arbitrary points in TI, and the need to place runes in your sectors creates wonderful tension because they require protection and it encourages more conflict, which is awesome in my book.

It still inherits some flaws like annoying and random tactic cards with effects ranging from useless to game breaking, or combat that plays itself. But I find it much more elegant and enjoyable overall, both thematically and mechanically, so I recommend trying it even if you didn't like TI3.

I like it well enough. Has the same 'and then it's over' thing that Warrior Knights does by the base rules. I like the combat, I like the three council/guild/whatever they're called positions, I like the seasons/orders mechanic.

The economy bit is weak, and it never really feels like I'm building a huge empire. It feels more like a three or four player computer RTS (Warcraft 2 or Starcraft) rather than anything big and epic.

This game always feels...strange.  It has many independent elements that I like, and yet as an integrated whole, it seems hard for me to feel strongly about it.  Probably the biggest "issue" of the game is that the ending somehow always feels anti-climactic, at least in the few games we've played.  Victory seems to just...sneak up on you in this game, even for the victor him/herself!  The set-up alone is practically a game in itself, or so we like to joke in our group.  

I would play more but don't feel a *drive* to play more, which puts it in a middling category for me.

Want a epic, sprawling game that puts you in charge of the destiny of an entire race? Look no further! I have never played a game that made me feel like more of a ruler of a powerful nation than this. Massive armies, powerful heroes, fierce hirelings (yes, you can ally with dragons). However, don't forget to continue to expand your resource supplies and garrison locations to support your armies. Also, don't forget the politics of influence bidding and the wizard's council. There are so many aspects to this great game, but it allows you to manage them all. After playing for the first time, I lost sleep while thinking about the game and possible strategies. That is a good thing, I promise.

While it's big and long and has tons of stuff going on, after a few turns it all came together pretty well. The fate deck, with its combat and other implications, is definitely a cool feature. The asymmetric armies are always a plus with me, they have their own feels without seeming imbalanced. While there is downtime for sure, there are enough interesting decisions in the action cards and their execution, the use of activation markers, Tactics cards vs. influence, and so on that it's a rewarding experience rather than simply a long one.

The components are great quality, though some cards are very small.

Runewars is an epic board game of conquest, adventure, and fantasy empires for two to four players. Runewars pits players against each other in a strategic game of battles and area control, where they must gather resources, raise armies, and lay siege to heavily fortified cities.
Runewars takes place in the same popular fantasy universe as the board games Runebound and Descent Journeys in the Dark, and dozens of fan-favorite heroes and monsters play their part. The wars for the dragon runes are beginning, and only one faction will emerge victorious.

Context: I traditionally like my decisions in a game to a more controlled impact as the length of the game increases. Runewars, for my group, is a 2-4 hour experience (from set up to pack down) and I consider this to be a "long" game.

I like this game.

I find that it fulfills on being an area-control, economic, strategic, civilization game. It scratches those itches really nicely, while providing some excellent decisions through the use of the Order cards. 
I would recommend playing this game to see if it suits you, because (as I have found, at least) it stands relatively alone in this area of the market. For what it does, I see few peers.
That is not to say the game is perfect. I have quibbles with the combat resolution (drawing cards and checking symbols) and would prefer something more in the control of the player. But, this would have increased the time-length and shifted the focus of the game. 
In short, do not go into this game expecting the combat to be a satisfying experience, it is a perfunctory distraction from the real meat of the game: The area-controlling, civ-building, economic, strategic engine.

I love making the decisions and every season that passes has my full attention. The hero phase (within the Summer season) is like a game within a game that I delight in. It gives the game layers and levels, but the caveat is that it can become distracting toward the later stages. 

I can't vouch for the replay value of the base game. But I can wholly say that the Banners of War expansion more than fills this gap. Acquiring this expansion took this game from being a cool part of my collection to a valued member. I wouldn't think of bringing the game out without at least one module in it from the expansion. 

All round thumbs up, the table-talk this game creates is excellent. A lot of banter and threats as secret agendas are laid bare each season.

Things seem pretty balanced between each of the races, to my knowledge, but it is INCREDIBLY important that you do not take short-cuts when setting up the map. Help new players make informed decisions or, like in simpler games like Catan, games will be won in the pick of starting positions. You will get accustomed to this, though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After one play with three, this game left me a little bit disappointed. The main reason for this, is that victory seems to rely quite a bit on luck. Like in most FFG games, there is a ridiculous amount of draw piles (and card drawing) involved, and many of the cards (especially the season and tactics cards) have a lot of influence on your winning chances. With three players, the weakest army was also continuously battered by the other two, leaving the impression that the game probably plays best with four. And then there is the insane amount of rules (40 pages no less!).
Despite all of this, the game is atmospheric and fun to play. Oddly enough, taking turns feels like a streamlined process (quite similar to Warrior Knights in fact), which will undoubteldy ensure a much faster second play. Downtime is not too bad, as players choose most of their actions simultaneously. The game also plays remarkably quickly, taking (in general) maybe three to four hours to complete. Components are good, but the box is mainly empty!
UPDATE: After a game with four players, I am strengthened in my believe that this is the optimal number of players. The game was more fun the second time, but I still find the random factor (and especially the potency of the tactics cards) pretty big, making for big (unpredictable) shifts in balance every now and then.

Initial rating after first play. I like it. The description of the game as 'the kitchen sink' of FFG design is very appropo. That said, it takes a lot of the things I like from the other FFG games and puts it in a stew I enjoy. Some of the aspects are a bit hard to wrap your head around - take the hero aspect of the game. While seemingly tacked on, its an aspect that can suddenly have the entire game wrapped around it. There's a bit of strategizing to this game that I'm going to enjoy digging in to. The rating will definitely change one way or another as more exposure occurs. I'm hoping it will go up!

Just suck up the few more hours and play TI3 instead. Or play BSG instead. :) 

More honestly, I think my big frustration with Runewars is that in its attempts to ramp up the speed, a lot of the more diplomatic aspects get lost (there's a clear beat up the leader, and if you fall behind early, you can't get back). It's still too long, however, to simply set aside all the bad experiences.

Пока что все впечатления будут предварительными ввиду малого количества партий. В целом же я пока весьма доволен игрой.

1. Изначально меня останавливала перед покупкой излишняя пестрость карты - я ожидал что будет сложновато находить на ней ресурсы и вообще. В целом это оказалось справедливо, но не так страшно, как например в последней Цивилизации. (А уж оформление в целом так и совсем лучше. И даже бой несопоставим). Самый неудачный момент игры для меня - относительная сложность подсчета ресурсов, который время от времени предстоит выполнять. Также в недостатки запишу что на части карт всетаки нет картинок.

2. Если же сравнить Рунварс с декбилдинговой Рун Эйдж - которая мне понравилась всем, кроме декбилдинга - то Рунварс для меня выигрывает именно наличием игровой карты (вместо декбилдинга).

3. Итак, это конечно америтреш во всей красе, но как и в TI3, тут отмечается множество положительных вкраплений.

i). Во-первых игра идет на достижение целей (ТИ3), но тока более явно стремление отбирать нажитое у соседей. Отбирать не обязательно - есть выбор.

ii). Как и в ТИ3 - есть выбор ролей. Хотя пул ролей уже не общий для игроков, он ничуть не менее замысловатый. Совершенно другой короче, и тоже заковыристый. Завязан на сезоны кстати (смотреть далее)

iii). Очень много рандома, что тематично и просчитываемо. Например вы можете укрепиться в узком проходе между гор, а вражина используя спец-карту пройдет через горы в обход. Вероятность наличия такой карты можно оценивать.

iv). Сезоны. Не считая того, что это тематично и вписывается в механику (например зимой кормят армию и замерзают реки) - интересно работает связка с выбором ролей, а также каждый сезон приносит свое случайное событие (в сравнении с общим пулом в Игре Престолов).

v). Кстати о Престолах. Тут тоже есть титулы и голосования. Сбор "бочек" также навевает сравнения - только ресурсов уже 3 типа, а случайные события так и норовят все сделать еще хуже (например засуха может заставить немедленно проапдейтить "бочки", да еще с пенальти). 

vi). Герои и квесты. Умеренно хорошо. Не вызвало такого отторжения как скажем было в WoW Мир Приключений (с их "меч +1 если выпадет 6"). Скорее можно говорить о желании большего разнообразия, что возможно решается дополнением.

vii). Баталии. Я все же ожидал, что в них будет некий элемент Warrior Knights (или если хотите Покера), но все оказалось проще. Честно говоря не совсем понимаю почему - имхо с теми же картами сражения можно было сделать более впечатляющими (возможно этим займусь еще).

Итого. Жестко выбирая роли мы пытаемся находить или отбирать руны. Очень тематично, эпично, много случайных событий, конфликтно и напряженно. По времени выглядит приемлимо.

This is one of those games that, when you see it, you think "wow, that looks really amazing, but there's soooo many pieces and cards and I'll bet the rules are super complicated." So, you hesitate to try it over playing a game you already know. But - after a single play of Runewars, it all just seems to 'click' in to place. It's very intuitive and an absolute blast to play, even when it appears someone is winning, there are multiple paths to victory and you still have a chance to claim more runes!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Feels like a streamlined version of Twilight Imperium. The game could have been amazing, but there are some issues. First, I agree with the nay-sayers: There is a slight disconnect between the "main game" and the hero sub-game. Secondly, the game sometimes feels like it "hands" a player victory by allowing him/her to gain runes all over the place without the player even having a semi-coherent strategy. Still, gameplay is very smooth and combat fast. Looking forward to the expansion (and if the expansion does the same for Runewars as the TI3-expansion did for that game, Runewars might be amazing yet). 

Update: After a few more plays, I've increased the rating by 1. This game has grown on me. 

We usually play with an optional rule: Play lasts for six years, i.e. 24 seasons. When the game ends, count runes. A false rune is worth 1 VP, a real rune 2. The player with the most VP wins. The tie-breaker is the player with the most real runes (second tie-breaker: most influence).

Update: Rating down 1. No one I know has really fallen for Runewars. After I got Conquest of Nerath, I have been wanting to play that instead.

Runewars is an epic board game of conquest, adventure, and fantasy empires for two to four players. Runewars pits players against each other in a strategic game of battles and area control, where they must gather resources, raise armies, and lay siege to heavily fortified cities.
\13\\13\
Runewars takes place in the same popular fantasy universe as the board games Runebound and Descent Journeys in the Dark, and dozens of fan-favorite heroes and monsters play their part. The wars for the dragon runes are beginning, and only one faction will emerge victorious.

RATING: 6
Intended to be a reboot of Battlemist, which was essentially a fantasy version of Twilight Imperium, this looked promising  to me. Twilight Imperium is amazing in scope, but the game hasn't aged all that well. It's too long, there's too much down time and all too often the game's action only involves two or three players when it is all said and done. If they could streamline this stuff, I was more than happy to bring this style game back to my tabletop.

Ironically, I think they took out too much. The card battle system is interesting, but it's also tedious. It also rewards card counting, which I understand is considered to be a feature by many, but I think it robs the battles of tension when the outcome is already known before the card is flipped.

Also, only including four races is laughable. There should have been at least eight in this box, to keep it interesting. Especially when you consider each race is somewhat pre-programmed via their unique unit selection to behave in a fixed way, when pursuing victory.

I'm also getting burnt out on Fantasy Flights obsession with printing tokens and cards with no words on them. Draw a card from the fate deck. Which one is that, none of them say FATE on them. Flip a token. It's a tiny picture of a desert, a swamp...or a plate of bacon. I really can't tell. I guess we'll have to look it up AGAIN. Seriously Fantasy Flight, enough with the token and crib sheet model and just print cards for everything already. Oh, and for the love of God, label them accordingly!

Very nice epic conquest game with a lot of twists and turns! Fantasy Flight really got it right with this one! Epic feel and yet a game of four will rarely take more than 3 hours.

More war than adventuring, there's a lot of logistics to keep up with in maintaining your army and recruiting neutrals for an effective campaign.  I like the subordinate role given to the heroes.  Simply put, if you want to play a hero adventure/exploration game, stick to Runebound, if you want a wargame in the Runebound world, get Runewars.  Plenty of room for future expansion to fit in the box.  Love the moutain terrain as well.

For what it is, it is a good game.  But, I am straying farther and farther from any interest in 4 hour multiplayer wargames.

There are lots of choices in the game, but I'm not certain any of them really matter a whole lot.  If you get a good board position and get some lucky cards, you win.  If not, you have a chance, but it is pretty tough . . .

This has become one of my favorite games.  It has a great epic scale, really fun mechanics, and tons of player interaction.  I would advise not to play with an angry gamer though.  I've never tried the expansion mainly because I play so rarely as it is that it still hasn't become stale.

A very detailed area-control/conflict type game with many different strategies. It was certainly fun after a fashion but perhaps a bit too long for my tastes and the learning curve is a bit steep. I wouldn't want to play it all the time but it might be something fun to revisit every now and again.

Bunch of great or average ideas from other games, but final result was somewhat not that good as I expected. Flaws: not much choice in variety of army and no good control over what army to produce; heroes too much disconnected from the rest of game and feel artificial due to the fact that they're mostly not fighting but collecting items to convert to runes; controlling runes enforce defensive play. Usually I'd choose Twilight Imperium 3 over this game.

I enjoy several aspects of this game. The battle system, although injected with a good deal of luck, is still fun and even 'workable', since you draw cards with symbols and hopefully get certain powerful symbols to damage the enemy. You can increase the odds of good draws in your favor by the amount of units you have to represent you in the battle.

Another thing I enjoy is the way this game makes confrontation eminent. Limited resources, which are needed for building strongholds and maintaining healthy troops, are found on the modular map tiles and give everyone a reason to conquer territory, along with the acquisition of cities and most importantly, dragon runes, which are what win you the game.

It is so much fun building troops and expanding terrain that I can sometimes forget that the real way to win this game is not how big or expansive your faction is, but simply how many dragon runes you have. 

The only 'drawback', is the length of play. I play only 2-player, and with full rules we average about 3 to 3 1/2 hours. But if I have that time to spend on this game, it is always a pleasure.

Shorter and more fun than Warrior Knights.  Our game's highlight: Heroes dying randomly due to poor quest-related Fate card draws (landslides, murmuring fairies, dinner gone horribly wrong, etc.).

Combat is a let-down, though, in that there are no choices to make once the units are in place.  In Warrior Knights, at least you get to choose a smaller hand of cards from those that are drawn.

Of the recent Fantasy Flight games, Middle Earth Quest has the most satisfying card-based combat system - primarily because players have real decisions to make across multiple combat rounds.  Runewars battles, in contrast, are mindless one-round exchanges where the players feel like spectators.

Quite good!  I like the interaction between the hero bits of the game and the army bits, it seems relatively well balanced, and it plays a bit quicker than TI3.  We did tweak the game a bit - forcing the placement of Runes out in the "No Mans Land" to increase direct competition - but only in minor ways.  But it's better than its reputation.

This is an odd one for me.  When I look at each individual element I really cant find things I like about the game. However when I add it all together I enjoy it and like playing it despite that.

In particular the combat seems more pointless than it should be. You can have a great army and win every battle and still finish in last place. The purpose of the combat it seems is to carve out enough space to store your victory points on which you can easily do with mediocre forces (the game ends before you can really reach your opponent and fight for his).  However to get the victory points is just some random quests -- making the game a light one despite the heavy systems for troop building and combat. 

Categorically its a strange game too (as are the others by this designer)  The mechanics are fun and novel but not thematic and dont work towards the theme in particular (which I can quite like in a game -- to have quirky fun mechanics that is) However past a certain minimal level of expertise the strategy is out of your control leaving you with a sit back and enjoy those quirky (but non-thematic) mechanics sort of ride.

An epic-feeling game in a package that plays in 3 or less hours. Order cards have a nice mechanic to them, heroes aren't in the spotlight but feel appropriate, and a tricky harvesting/resource system all mix well together.

The game intrigues me. Sometimes I find it quite shallow, other times it's deep but not too complex.
The nasty thing is that you need to plan every move. It's not only important to choose the right order card but also to gain the right superiority bonus and on top of that plan your next move with that same card - accoring to it's number value!
At first I felt that the heroes are a bad idea - didn't see much point in using them. Now I see the point :) - they are a nice tool to get more Dragon Runes.

Massive box filled with Chinese air and a shitload of plastic.

System feels overburdened with waaay too many annoying decks of cards, and spinning plates. The rules governing the heroes are just awful and unthematic, and the most broken thing about the game is the negotiation aspect - which can lead to gargantuan swings in power.

I enjoyed the game, but you put into it more than you get out - over a very long playing time.

There's quite a bit to like about the system - on a case-by-case basis - but ultimately there's too much overhead, for me, and not enough payoff. 

If I'm to play an undead king, make me feel empowered/overpowered - don't have me worrying about how much grain I need to feed my troops (they're freakin' undead - why do they need food!?). Winter is one of the largest threats in this game.

Excellent game. Finally a good 4X game in the fantasy realm. It has some very excellent mechanics.

My one gripe is the randomness of battle with the fate deck and the ability to know how many units to bring to a battle. You can always win a battle..but knowing the exact right amount..is almost impossible to know and can leave you very weak to counterattack.

Runewars reminds me a lot of Twilight Imperium 3.  It is not quite as involved or complex, but RW takes the same feel and distills it to a 2 - 3 hour game instead of a 6-8 hour one.  Each game I have played has worked differently and seems to be dependent on what your objective(s) are, which race you use and what the board set up is.  There were games where the winner was very aggressive, and games where they were able to create a fortress while they built up their rune stockpile.  I like that for every victory point you get (runes), you have to be able to defend it from being stolen away.  This is another great game from a great designer!

I also enjoy the seasons and planning my orders over the course of the game-year.  I’m a fan of long games, and the game-year structure of this game makes each turn feel grandly epic.

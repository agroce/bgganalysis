I like the figures, I like the idea and I like the execution. I only wish you could level up more. I miss that about D&D. I want to level up a character again, but in a board game. I have other games that scratch that ich to some extent but was really hoping this would do it all. Still, a fun game.

This game is pretty fun. I really like how the board tiles are added during the game. Each time we play, the dungeon will always be different which I think is really cool.

Some interesting differences from LOD. The whole game system is amazing. The fan made customs (for all the sets) are fantastic and I have made a load of my own custom beasts from my mini collection. A great, great D&D fix, for those of us that don't RPG anymore.

RATING: 9
Cooperative dungeon explorer with a great emphasis on the unknown and the random as the dungeon is revealed tile by tile as you play...
2nd of the D&D Board Game...

-1 For weird mechanic that make a specific hero 'own' a specific monster. Can be confusing at time, when 2 or 3 monsters of the same type are in play at the same time...
-1 Because some thing are not well explained, like which dungeon tiles are considered standard and which are considered specific to an Adventure... Hint: Read each Adventures and remove tiles with a specific name, these are Special Adventure tiles...
+1 For creating a gameplay link mechanic between adventures: Gathering gold while playing and using gold to purchase items between Adventures, making you feel that your heroes has some kind of progression from adventure to adventure, without falling into the 'Being too overpowered' trap...

See my comments for Castle Ravenloft.

Wrath is basically the same game with some new tweaks, but not enough where I'm going to pick one over the other.

They're compatible with one another for home brews.

Basically it comes down to preference and which theme you like better—the dungeon crawl under the mighty castle facing undead hordes, or the classic fantasy adventure of going after the big bad dragon.

Both are great games.

The "D&D Adventure System" was expanded nicely with this release.

First Impression: This is a lot of gaming stuff for your gaming bucks. I look at it like a gaming sandbox with much potential beyond the official documentation. This is pure RPG-geek heaven.

Final Impression: Just like the first game in the series, it's very light (though a bit more meaty than the first game - Ravenloft). I have some problems with it but I do like theme much better and the solitaire system is unique and it works. If there were more scenarios or other games that you could add to this, I'd be more enthusiastic. (Sold it)

Lots of fun. The action starts from first turn with the first card draw. With the maximum of 5 players there is a fair amount of time between player actions but not too bad because when the action heats up, everyone get in on discussing what to do and who to do it to. Monster and encounter cards are drawn almost every player turn so there is almost no time when nothing is happening.

RATING: 10
Finally played it as I have been going through each D&D boardgame one by one. I noticed this actually has some interesting changes from Castle Ravenloft to include some interesting monsters and heroes power. Those really added some inspiration for those using the system as tool kits or for modification.

Really enjoy the system and this game in particular to allows fluid modification to make the game more fun. At least I have enjoyed the game a lot and spent many hours on it.

1st play: An interesting dungeon crawler. The tile art was pretty bland but the system was fun. It didn't feel like most co-ops, where you're just racing against a deck, even tho that was happening. The theme was strong, and there was lots of treasure. A decent game.

2nd play: Technically we played Drizzt, but it's the same system with different map and heros. I enjoyed myself playing this, and if I end up seeing one of the games for cheap, I'll pick it up, even if only for the minis in the box. One of my favorite co-ops - a short list.

For general comments on the game see my comment for its sister game, Castle Ravenloft. The games are similar enough that most of the comments I made for that game apply as well.

So what about the specifics for this game? Overall I like it and enjoyed it better than Castle Ravenloft. There is enough new stuff in this game to keep it interesting and different enough that if you were a fan of the 1st one this iteration should also be a game you will like as much if not more. The heroes start out a little bit tougher since they also get a racial ability in this game. But most of the monsters are tougher as well. Half the monsters have 2 hps compared with just 3 in the previous game. That coupled with a more deadly condition (Poisoned) makes for many more difficult situations. 

The monsters in this game also have an entirely different feel to them. There are three monsters that can poison a character which is nasty. Two other in particular set a theme for this set with a new category: Sentry. While not especially tough on their own they serve to bring more monsters into the game on their turn. These monsters coupled with new types of tiles (Hallways and Chambers both of which bring in more than one monster at a time) means you will tend to have more monsters on the board at any given time which creates its own problems. Add in the Legion Devil which puts 3 of these monsters on the board with one card and it's not hard to get swamped by monsters. The characters themselves also add to the problem of having more monsters on the board at a time. Most of the characters do not have the ability to attack multiple monsters or do more than one point of damage with an At-Will attack. This is in contrast to Castle Ravenloft. This also leads to having more monsters on the map at any given time. This creates very interesting tactical situations and provides a completely different feel to the game compared to Castle Ravenloft.

Overall, I like this version. It has it's own feel to it which I think is nice and wasn't really what I was expecting when I got the game. I'd be really skeptical about combining this with Castle Ravenloft since I think the two have quite a different feel and balance. They are really each their own game and I don't think either should be considered an expansion to the other.

I'm big into D&D, but for some reason, these games are just ok for me.  Maybe I haven't played with the right group.  I'll never get rid of this, however, even thought the box is huge.  The minis alone are too cool to give up.

RATING: 5
Simplistic Hack and Slash dungeoncrawler.
No sense of adventure, just endless fighting.
You don't get to search a room for hidden doors or treasure. What way you go in the dungeon matters little, as the scenario specific tile is drawn according to it's placement in the stack - not by your choices.
Too many choices are made by the game, not the players.

RATING: 4
Customisation - lots of options available through official and community created content including: plethora of scenarios, custom campaigns with new heroes and even changed gameplay mechanics to include proper leveling. Now I'm not someone who wants to customise their game (outside of sleeves and plano boxes) as I prefer to play vanilla or with official expansions, so I attribute this as the 2nd biggest reason I'm getting rid of them. If you love customising games and using lots of variants with PnP stuff then this may be for you!

Components - Top notch, card stock is good along with the quality of the tiles, love how they lock into each other. The insert is actually quite usable even though I opted for deck boxes and planos  You'll be getting your monies worth in terms of box contents.

Minis! - This gets it's own category! When I first started collecting boardgames I originally wanted games with Mini's and games like Mage Knight seemed so abstract and hard to grasp with it's coloured tokens. I also had plans to paint them which lasted for about 10mins after I got them home. Now that I owned and have played a few more games I've noticed that a lot of games substitute mini's to hide shallow mechanics and unfortunately I feel these games are that, plus I have no issues anymore believing my purple wooden token is a dog! cool

Gameplay - I love complex games but also really simple games like PAGC, Elder Sign and Dungeon Roll... But the D&D Adventure Games were just a chore to play, for the setup time and length of gameplay I really felt like I was just going through the motions to finish the game in order to say I'd done another playthrough and I tend to enjoy longer games like Robinson Crusoe and Mage Knight. Rolling a single D20 is also a bit of a bummer and I like ideas where people have instead used 2x D10's.
Mechanics are too predictable (i.e. A monster WILL spawn if you encounter a new tile) and takes away immersion from the game, games like Galaxy Defenders and Gears of War have similar mechanics but still maintain some unknown elements in them that keep the game fresh and fun (I don't own either but have played them). I also thought about keeping this game to play with my wife/friends but even they were bored with the game after a very short time.

Theme - This was the biggest reason for me to ditch them! For me as Theme can make or break a game for me in terms of creativity and imagination. I had real troubles getting immersed in these games and letting my creativity take over. I felt the theme just wasn't there or at least kept pulling me out, aside from the mini's everything else just seemed... lifeless. 
The tiles themselves are good but all very samey with not too much difference. The cards were the worst bit, very little art or style, the font was bad and I haven't seen many people comment about it but for me the font was the biggest immersion breaker. I'm not looking for cursive text or an aged scroll to read off but at least choose something less... sterile and office like. Theme is one of the main reasons I enjoy Mice and Mystics, if the theme wasn't there on that game I'd probably have the same opinion as I have here. Some of the tokens were also just a coloured background with plain font text saying what it was which just seemed lazy if they were able to print proper art on other tokens. 

Support - I really felt WoTC let the whole team down on this one, they virtually copy pasted their games after Ravenloft

I have only played the game solo yet, som my rating is only based on the solo game experience. 

Wrath of Ashardalon, and the other D&D Adventure System Coop Games, aims at recreating a simplified D&D experience. The first thing that strikes me is how easy and quick the game setup is. If you store the cards and tokens sorted all you have to do is to shuffle the room tiles, and the monster-, treasure-, and encounter-decks. If you want you can spend a few minutes customizing your hero. 

The rules are really easy, and everyone should get a hang of it after a few game rounds. The game AI plays smoothly (at least in the solo game) and the monster card/controlling player mechanism works nicely. 
Gameplay consists of moving you hero around and battling monsters. Combat works like a simplified version of D&D, roll a D20 and add your combat bonus(es). If you equals or beat the monsters Armour Class you deal damage to it. Each monster you defeat grants you a treasure, and treasures can really help you in completing the mission. If you end your turn adjacent to an unexplored room edge you draw and place a new room tile. Each room comes with a monster, and sometimes an encounter. If you end your turn without exploring an encounter happens. Monsters and encounters are drawn randomly from the monster- and encounter-decks.

Different adventures have different winning conditions, and they can use different special room tiles and have different villains. Since monsters and encounters are drawn randomly each game play is different even when playing the same adventure. But since each game play uses the same formula of randomly drawing monsters and encounters it is my belief that each game play will feel to similar after a while. I haven't played enough to test this yet thou, so I hope that I am wrong on this.

So does the game recreate the D&D feeling? In a simplified manner yes. There's no roleplaying element, and the game is extremely simplified. But if you enjoy hack'n slash roleplaying you should also enjoy this game. Personally I would have liked to see a little bit more depth, but more depth would probably have meant a more complex game so perhaps not.

How does WoA compare to other dungeon crawlers? Compared to Decent WoA plays more quickly, is easier to set up and have a better game flow. It does thou lack depth and the adventures can seam to similar.

Do I recommend Wrath of Ashardalon? If you like dungeons crawlers and don't mind sacrificing depth for a quick setup and good game flow, sure I recommend it. If you are after the whole D&D experience you'll probably want to look elsewhere.

I wanted to like this game so much. But it comes down to just the grindy parts of D&D, without the fun parts. I love 4th Ed D&D, upon which this is based, but I don't love or even like this game. Caveat: I've only played with my nine-year-old, and perhaps that is affecting my enjoyment, as it could be going slower than it should.

The D&D Adventure Series of modular tactical miniature games are great gateways to bring video gamers or RPG gamers into the board game hobby. They're a lot of fun, despite not offering quite as much in the way of strategy and storytelling as some other adventure games. [b]Wrath of Ashardalon[/b] is the second installment, and is my favorite of the three, representing the best choice for a classic Dungeons and Dragons feel. If you have to have just one, and are not interested in having a specific focus on undead (Castle Ravenloft) or the R.A.Salvatore novels (Legend of Drizzt), then I would recommend Wrath of Ashardalon as the one to choose from this series, as it offers a broad array of classic monsters as well as a balanced roster of heroes.

One the one hand we have more variety, NPCs, Items-only treasures, more interesting monsters and a light campaign system but on the other hand we have less-exciting quests that ends almost everytime in drawing a chamber card and defeating the bad guys. So the quests in Ravenloft were more interesting and a bit more challinging.

Nonetheless it is an autobuy for the D&D adventure system fans and for players who are looking for a bigger variety!

Read above for Castle Ravenloft. My rating is higher for WOA because of the extra campaign rules. They add even more greatness to this system. I hope that Legend of Drizzt keeps up the high quality of these games. EDIT 7/28/15: Not quite as strong as CR or LOD as it turns out. I feel that the characters are slightly underpowered compared to the other 2 games. Also, I really don't like the fact that Ashardalon can just randomly show up in any quest and isn't part of any of the quests in the Adventure Book. That's just dumb, IMHO.

I'd play with no Healing Surges - makes the game more difficult and increases the tactical considerations since you can't have a hero stay down.

I think the problem is that your decision making is very limited, you basically HAVE to explore since the Encounter cards are so punishing.  This makes the No Surge variant bad in some ways, since the Encounter cards are so punishing.

I have tried playing this a few times solo with variants, but I am not sure if the variants I've tried help.  I sold this game so I'd stop trying to fix it.

I think Doom is a better game because a) the spawn mechanic requires you to do more than run in guns-blazing.  b)  The mechanic that encourages you to move on doesn't FORCE you to move on.  The overlord gets a better hand if you're slow, but you can still set your team up to COUNTER his improved hand.  I'm not saying this is a winning strategy, but it doesn't rely on arbitrary Encounter effects.  c) The rooms are big enough to allow you some options.  d) Allowing the marines to take their turns in any order allows a lot more tactical flexibility - this could be done in Wrath, I suppose, as long as the monsters still activated in the same order.

Only had brief plays of this - I'm currently painting up the minis at a very slow pace - the rules seem straight forward, the modular tiles are good and I like not having to worry about a DM so looking forward to getting more into it when my minis are fully painted.

I like these co-operative D&D board games. However, I prefer Ravenloft or Drizzt over this one. 

There are some cool elements in this game (NPCs, chambers, doors, sentries). However, this iteration has a lot more upkeep than the others: more monsters on the board, more treasures to manage, conditions, curses, environmental e encounter cards.  There gets to be too much you have to keep track of. The other problem with this version is that there is very little variety in the scenarios. 

Drizzt and Ravenloft play better and have more variety in their scenarios.

Nice miniatures, ugly board!  A tough bash as the game constantly throws everything at you, plus penalizes you if you try to play smart by keeping the party together (not constantly exploring).  Not a terrible game, and maybe other scenarios add more flavor?

Really liked this game when I started.  After numerous plays (including the entire campaign mode) I get why the system is designed the way it is, but I find dungeoncrawls like Descent far more interesting.  The D&D box games feel too gamey.  Monster tactics and placement rules work for giving the heroes a chance, but make no sense logically.  Descent gives a far better sense of player progression and an "RPG-like" feel to the game that the D&D games will never have.  Which is disappointing given their source material.

RATING: 7.5
My first foray into the D&D Adventure System back in 2011.  Great miniatures and decent components, but I house rule the gameplay a bit to make it more dynamic.  I added in some monster movement and a few other things similar to Arkham Horror to make the mechanics a bit less wash, rinse, repeat than the vanilla rules.

The game System is a bit boring. The components and figures are really outstanding...but the game does not allow much tactic. You either place a tile or Need to draw an Encounter Card...thats it. There is no Chance to really upskill your heroes, you can only tune your dice luck which is not sufficient in my eyes.

Similar to Ravenloft, I prefer the theme of this one and the game play seems a bit improved. I like the sentry monsters that spawn new tiles and additional monsters.

All in all if you like Ravenloft this should certainly hit the spot too, and you can mix/match the characters and monsters between the two as well.

Deadlier monsters, traps, and encounters than Ravenloft seriously add to the difficulty but subtract from the fun.  Plus,  even more errata with the new stuff.  It's like the designers learned nothing from their previous experience.

Its a good dungeon crawl game on the easy side of the spectrum, it is not Descent but at the end I play this more often because it is shorter. 
Pros: easy to learn, short 60/90 mins, cool minis, fun with kids
Cons: the event cards can be a bit repetitive (damage,damage,damage), the levelling system is unrewarding (why only with a 20 roll?)

I enjoyed the one time I played this game, but then again we were playing the starter scenario, so I'm worried that the next ones are much more challenging. I really don't love super tough co-op games, haha!

What I DO like is that (from what I remember) there is not a ton of maintenance going on between rounds. The thing that bothers me the most about co-ops is when you're getting down to the we-are-about-to-lose part of the game and people sit and calculate out the exact turns, often times taking about 15 minutes to do so, when the reality is that there is only like a 25% chance of the game allowing us to not lose. For me that is not fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Cool concept (refined to great benefit and much better gameplay in The Legend of Drizzt) that is just too difficult using the by-the-book rules.  We only play this one with modified rules to reduce the number of Encounter cards drawn, and we might even give ourselves a couple of extra Healing Surges.  The enemy stats and number of Encounter cards drawn (and the powerful negative effects of the Encounter cards) make this game significantly more difficult than its sequel, The Legend of Drizzt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good game. One of the best Dungeoncralws out there, especially if you combine the different D&D Adventure games. You´ll then end up with tons of heroes, monsters, treasures and events. Wonderful minis and components. I wish the exploration factor and the tiles had a little more effect on the game. The game could have a lot more atmosphere if not for the lack of artwork on the cards and the tiles. They missed an opportunity here. It could have been the greatest Dungeoncrawl out there...

They could do a lot better with the characters, a more classic bunch would be more appealing imo.

I think Drizzt is a better buy if you 'll only get one of them. 

I got this one though and the itch has been scratched :)
Nice minis, item prices, ideas for time spent between adventures and the fast action-non forgiving gameplay of the system all here! 6.5/10

This review applies to both Castle Ravenloft and Wrath of Ashardalon.

I have generally held that, having played decades of real RPGs, RPG-lites have nothing to offer me.  I was wrong.  This game is cute, takes ten minutes to set up, and presents fun little tactical puzzles with fantasy dressing.

The RPG veteran in me chafes at the restrictions, but the general gamer in me likes the simplicity when it comes to playing with neophytes and my children.

Cool game series! I'm happy to play, though there are a few hiccups. First, it needs a very strong campaign mode. Second, it's a little annoying that when you encounter critters, they almost always attack first. There's got to be a better mechanism.

I tried this with four other people, and that might be one or two too many, as it exaggerates the downtime between turns. But, there's a good bit to like here.

The player's stats are straightforward, but there's enough decision making to keep it interesting. The programmed actions of the monsters are very cool. There's very little "fluff" in this game, and for a dungeon crawl, this is very accessible.

Seeing how this game is so effective, it would be hard to fall back to Descent. A game like this needs to move at a good clip, withou unecessary layers of rules. That's why I'd bet this game is really good with two or three players.

One play (2p), Adventure 2.
For six turns or so we didn't even manage to get off one half of the start tile due to monster spawn and movement... 
It's not so much about exploring a dungeon, more surviving an ever growing bunch of creatures for as long as you can before you die anyway.
Well okay, we reached the bodycount and won this adventure, but still, that's how the game feels :)

Doesn't live up to the hype. No atmosphere to speak of - tiles are all the same, and gameplay consists of get a new (bland) tile, get a new monster, get an (almost always bad) encounter, fight.

I can see the reason for the encounter system, but it doesn't fit well with the story of the game. You're in the middle of a big fight, and get punished by some random happening which has no connection to your current location/situation, and which doesn't affect the monsters, because you haven't finished the fight yet.

I'm playing it with my kids, but I doubt my friends will like it.

RATING: 5
So far pretty much what I expected - a little too simple and random. The encounter cards that trigger each turn make it all feel a bit too abstract. In a game like pandemic, that's highly abstracted, a card draw each turn that twists the plot works great - in a minis based game it just doesn't work great.

Still, I took this out to give it a few  more plays, and increased my rating of the game - some of the rule simplifications really are quite well done. The abstracted monster intelligence is fairly well done.

Could be fun if coupled with a few beers. But then again, there are better dungeoncrawlers out there.
It might be the only dungeoncrawler without a dungeon master, available right now. But it doesn't do that part very well, sadly.

Since I've rated Ravenloft a 9 there is no reason to do the same here. The basic premise remains unchanged - a fast cooperative romp through a randomized dungeon.

I played this after playing Ravenloft & Drizzt, and I loved it.  Even with my first play I had a nail-biter.  The character powers & treasure cards really made the experience.  It ended with me against the level boss and 3 monsters at my back.  Thanks to some well placed caltrops and a treasure card that let me turn one of the monsters against the other two, the day was saved.  This system gets better the more I play it.  Highly recommended when descent is not an option.

RATING: 7
Seems to address some of the issues I have with Castle Ravenloft.  Loot!  Real loot!  I like that it's mostly permanent items instead of "insta-use on acquire".  Makes you feel like you are getting more powerful.  The setting and monsters are also more interesting to me; it also helps that many of the monsters have 2 health, which means they tend to stick around on the map longer giving you more targets to deal with.

I found this to be way more fun than Castle Ravenloft.

This game is a stand by for my regular group. We actually haven't played it in a while, but we've gotten a lot of mileage out of it, for sure. Very fun if you're into tactical dungeon crawl style games. Reminiscent of Descent and the like. 

The reason I gave it a 7 is that I can tire of it after prolonged play sessions.

Mazmorrero cooperatiu, que pot resultar tremendament difícil.
Cada jugador porta un heroi, amb característiques i habilitats diferents. Alguns són millors en combat cos-a-cos, altres atacant a distància, altres desactivant trampes, etc.
S'ha de mirar de fer un equip compensat i jugar molt molt coordinats, fent que el jugador més fort rebi les hòsties, protegint el més dèbil (que a més pot atacar a distància), fent que el Rogue (pícaro) desactivi trampes, etc.
De temàtica és força xulo i les figuretes molen!. A veure si el pinto algun dia :) --> Pintat excepte el Drac i l'altre bitxo gros.

Dungeons & Dragons : Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game is een thematisch coöperatief spel voor 1 tot 5 spelers in de wereld van Dungeons & Dragons.

De spelregels zijn heel eenvoudig. Elke speler kiest een held. Deze helden trekken in een duistere kerker. Elke beurt kunnen de spelers een nieuwe kerker ontdekken (trek een nieuwe tegel en leg deze tegel aan je bestaande kerker). Daarna kunnen de helden in deze nieuw ontdekte kerkers trekken en daar monsters aanvallen. In elke kerker zit een monster. Je verslaat monsters door hoge ogen met de dobbelstenen te gooien en door goed gebruik te maken van je kaarten met speciale eigenschappen. Opgepast: de monsters vechten terug! Daarnaast zijn er nog speciale kaarten die jou en je medespelers allerlei onheil bezorgen. Je zal dus goed moeten samenwerken met je medespelers om de monsters te verslaan en zelf te overleven.

RATING: 6.5
An OK entry into the draw-cards-and-roll-dice genre.  The rules are a bit ambiguous (specific monster movement?  lines of sight?), but nothing a seasoned gamer can't fudge. 
The components are very nice though.

I worry that the game could be too brutal -- in a game where your character might have 8 HP, there are a lot of "lose 1 HP a turn until you do X" conditions.  Yak a couple of die rolls and you're screwed.  On the plus side, the mechanics are very simple and the game doesn't take all that long.

Better than Ravenloft.  Tactics on the monsters are more varied and nice to get an actually useful treasure once in a while.  Map develops in a more interesting way with long hallways, chambers, and guards.  Still, I think a mix of the harder hitting Ravenloft monsters and some of the crap Ravenloft treasure to average down, and the game system could be dead on.

Players are dungeon heroes, cooperating in an assault on a mountain guarded by a dragon.  Cooperative fantasy game where players take turns trying to achieve scenario objectives.  Turns are very simple - move and attack; explore the dungeon, attack with any of "your" monsters (ones you triggered).  Combat is standard D&D D20+modifiers against armour class, inflicting hit points.  The game, almost identical mechanically to Castle Ravenloft, is very intense and tough to beat, as monsters typically get first whack at you, and your hit points erode very quickly.  The difficulty can be tuned though, via different numbers of healing surges.  Again, nice components - terrific value for money.  Nice adventure book, with good meaty campaign rules.  Nice bits, great minis, simple rules and 12 scenarios, including solitaire.  Very pleased - solid dungeon crawler.

These games are fantastic especially when playing with my wife(actually all games get elevated to awesome status when playing with my wife but these ones do especially).  Get in crazy situations, blast your way out, or die trying.  I find if I burn my special abilities throughout the course of the game rather than save them for the end I have a much better time.  Great moments in board gaming have been had here.  

Ravenloft seems the most challenging/punishing of the bunch.  If you want to get whooped badly then this one is for you.

Ashardalon seems easier as a lot of the treasures are really sick (powerful).

Drizzt certainly has the most powerful characters and hence the easiest scenarios, but the characters are also the most interesting to play due to the mechanics behind their abilities.  Play without healing surges.

Ravenloft and Ashardalon heroes can be elevated to Drizzt level power with that amazaballs Ashardalon loot, although they still won't be as mechanically interesting.

Great components, the system the game works by is excellent allowing a lot of variation and tactics. it's wonderfully simple, but very variable.

I'd have given this an 9, however i think an opportunity has been missed, this board game could have worked really well with the wider D&D minatures product line, as in essence theyre very compatible, however the tiles that come with the game have tabs to link them, D&D minatures tiles dont have these, so they wouldn't fit together very well. If they did you could buy all sorts of new tiles (which feature the same sized illustrations and squares btw).

Maybe it is a dumbed-down version of D&D role-playing, but it is a ton of fun to play.

This is the first of these D&D games I played, and after playing Castle Ravenloft I realize this one is more steady and balanced (and Legend of Drizzt is the most streamlined of them all, taking all the best points of Ashardalon and placing them around a core of well defined characters), but all the games are essentially the same. Having all 3 is awesome since now I can mix and match my fave elements from all! My favorite hero in this set is the half-orc rogue - he seems to have the most options, which I guess makes thematic sense for a character type who would be essentially a selfish opportunist in all circumstances. Of the 3 games, this one has my favorite mix of monsters with classic D&D types like the beholder, the grell, orcs, the gibbering mouther, and of course a huge red dragon.

Builds on the Castle Ravenloft engine and adds some much needed variety and depth to the monster AI.

I like to play this game with my gaming group when we are in the mood for a dungeon crawl. However, I feel like I can't like it as much as I would like to. The ambiguous rules make it feel like it didn't go through enough play-testing. Also, the never-ending barrage of encounters is brutal and can get annoying at times. I feel like if this game had a dedicated DM who could generate encounters where appropriate and control monsters, then it wouldn't feel like your characters aren't being put through an automated, medieval spanking machine. I have recently purchased Descent and even though I have only read through the rules without a play under my belt, I think that game is going to become my go-to dungeon crawl game.

I'm not big on the D&D ADventure Series games.  My daughter, however, loves them.  I find the setup too much to have one player roll bad and end the game 10 minutes in.  The game seems to lose it's balance because of the random card draws and dice.  Some games seem to flow well, and tell a fun story.  Other games can be brutally evil against the players.  I find that level of variance between plays off-putting.  It definitely though plays better with a group (even if going solo, you want to control 3 characters).

I give it a 6 because of my daughter loving it, and it does really pack a lot into the box for the price.

Okay, I'm a huge fan of D&D 3.5 edition, despite its many flaws ... D&D 5e has returned to its roots while 4e was utter failure, in my opinion. That said, the D&D board games are [i]exactly[/i] what 4e should've been all along!

I've always loved the Dungeons & Dragons board games. They bring flavor and dungeon crawling to the table in an easily digestible package. For a while, however, they ended up taking the back seat to other games in my collection (or on my wish list) since I did not get to play them as often as I would like. But then I started playing these games more and more with my kids and their glory returned to the table once more!

These games are interesting, challenging, and captivating, whether you win or lose. This particular game is probably my least favorite of the bunch, but still a great game!

More fun with other players, definitely. However, overstays its welcome by about 30 minutes. Our plays have run more towards 90 minutes. Just too many details, plusses and minuses, various rule contradictions, to keep track of.

In solo plays, I've been a little disappointed by the monster tactics. I was expecting the different monsters to act differently, but the majority of them are identical. "If possible, attack hero with a ____. If not, move closer." Roll, lather, rinse, repeat.

Which means there not a whole lot of strategy going on here. It can still be fun to see what comes your way, but actual planning is very limited.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Adds minor improvements to Castle Ravenloft.

The game mechanics are almost identical, if you can play one you can play the other, but the components, characters and cards all seem better in quality and more balanced.

There is a ton of potential with the components and system...I guess it goes with the idea that RPGs generally carry, it's what YOU make out of it.

I opt to play this solo more than any other board game it seems. It draws me back in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My immediate impression is that it reminds me of 'Doom: The Boardgame' and 'Descent', which isn't surprising since those two were based on the d20 system.

Anyways, it's not spectacular, more complex than 'Dungeon!' so playing it with the kids is less of a boring slog, and less complex than 'Super Dungeon Explore' so again, playing with the kids (esp. the younger one) means less playing 'for him'.

Although it claims to be DM-less, what actually happens to us is that one player explores, spawning a monster. The other players move in to attack, kill it, comes back around to the same player exploring next round. That player ends up controlling the majority of the monsters/traps/etc so in effect might as well be the DM.

RATING: 6
Fast-paced, simplistic dungeon crawl, but in this case, somewhat too simplistic. Strategy is usually transparent, and tactics are limited, especially after "daily powers" are used. I like the ability to select some of the character's powers (daily, utility powers). Even so, the options are often very limited. Additionally, the lack of depth in monster cards is disappointing - unless combined with other games (Dungeon Command card help substantially). Theme and presentation are nice, but overall, the game system lacks substance. Limited to light play, but does fill that niche fairly well. The "campaign" tacked on to the end of the scenario book is overly-simplistic and repetitive.

Well not a perfect game, to me this is the best of the 3 D&D sets.  Just has the coolest monsters and bosses, the most balanced characters, and the best encounter deck.  These games are fun and can actually take some teamwork and strategy to win.  That being said if you just roll like crap you can be easily overwhelmed.  This is the best system I've seen for a no DM dungeon crawl. I agree with some of the complaints about the monsters attacking first every round, and the annoying encounter cards that smack you every turn.  I play with 3 simple house rules to try to improve some of these problems.
1.  Only draw an encounter card if you don't explore at all.   
2. If when exploring you draw a tile with a white arrow, give the monster card placed to the player on your right.  If you draw a tile with a black arrow, the monster gets the jump on you (it is their dungeon after all) and the active player gets the monster card.
3. To balance the game with these changes you will need to play with the treasure counters and not the cards. I like this better because its easy to get way to many cards then you can keep track of.  This works well if you playing the campaign and you buy cards with gold after each mission.

RATING: 7.12
After a couple of plays, this one continues to fall (especially since Descent 2e came out.)  It feels very much like a tactical miniatures game...not a bad thing, but I find myself wishing for a more story driven, epic campaign driven theme.

Props though for it's awesome components and integration with other titles (which I intend to pick up to see if the variability helps make this one better.)

Dungeon crawler de la saga de los casi inventores del dungeon crawling (Dungeons & Dragons)

Tiene todos los componentes del genero: mazmorra, trampas y peligros, bichos duros de pelar y un grupo de heroes en constante peligro. 

Se juega sin SS. una serie de reglas se encarga de hacer aparecer y actuar a las huestes malignas. 

No tiene el "punch" de descent ni tematica, ni jugablemente. es un buen juego, pero es de esos que cuando has probado otro juego que esta "una liga por arriba"... lo dejas aparcado y no ve mesa. 

En general es un buen juego, pero se nota que en el mundo de D&D los juegos de mesa no son precisamente la prioridad. En cualquier caso, es un buen dungeoncrawler y aconsejable sobre todo para un grupo que quiera jugar cooperativamente, sin SS.

RATING: 7.5
If anything, this is even better than Ravenloft--pure condensed dungeon crawl goodness with no overhead. Sure, combining the two games in a robust fashion is pretty much a non-starter, but it's trivial and awesome to combine the bestiary and heroes. 
The new stuff (doors, chambers), somewhat unsurprisingly, is rather poorly explained. Come on, guys.

RATING: 8
Having only played a scenario in each, I really can't comment on whether this or Castle Ravenloft is better other than to say that dragons are obviously cooler than vampires. These D&D board games function as a very stripped-down version of a D&D dungeon crawl (devoid of any real role-playing). I find Descent to be a much more enjoyable experience as I think the presence of a player Overlord and the increased tactical options add a lot. However, the game length obviously suffers for it, so this is a game you can play a lot faster than Descent.

Each player gets a hero, makes some choices about starting skills and abilities, and heads into the dungeon to start exploring. Tiles are revealed from the stack, each containing a monster with its own scripted AI that it follows (generally running towards the nearest hero and trying to kill it). Combat is handled with a single roll of the d20, compared to the armor class of the target, damage value reduces target's hit points, end of turn. Each player also controls some monsters that move at the end of their turns, mainly following the AI script, but with a few player choices as well. Each game is scenario-based, so the goals and tile layouts will be a little different each time, often even within the same scenario. Working together, the players will find treasure, kill monsters, and hopefully save the day. 

The components are a mixed bag. It's an enormous box, chock-full of tiles, tokens, and plastic. However, the cards themselves, while of high quality, are very bland to look at. When you find a sword, you don't get to see a picture of it (despite the publisher's extensive library of D&D artwork they could have easily used), you get to see a bunch of text. Similarly, the plastic figures are provided unpainted, despite the fact that the publisher also manufactures painted versions. Players wanting to replace their unpainted versions with painted ones by tracking down single D&D Minis will often be halted by the high prices of some of the rarer ones. Even if it was cost prohibitive to provide these in the base game, the publisher certainly had the ability to offer a full set of painted minis separately, which would have helped out its consumers significantly. The game really comes alive using the painted minis. 

I am someone who often doesn't like co-operative games. I see them as nothing more than a group optimization puzzle, or in some cases sheer randomness with only an illusion of control. Because of this, they either lose their flavor once "solved", or simply feel like a pointless waste of time. But these games really are my favorite co-ops ever because they avoid these pitfalls. Yes it is possible to get better at the game, but this is mainly by knowing the monsters and items. And yes, randomness will determine a lot of your success or failure. But because the theme and story are so important, you don't really mind this. Ultimately, this is what D&D is all about: story over gameplay. It really works well here.

All in all a fantastic romp.

I actually like this, but have to drop the rating on the basis of chrome. The dull, dull, dull design of the cards, chits, and other miscellaneous markers is disappointing.

It just feels like a prototype in a way though, as if the markers are just screaming "insert art here".

I was excited to try this game, since it was billed as a shorter, lighter Descent, and length is really what's been keeping Descent off my table. It is indeed shorter.

A slight modification made both: WoA and CA a bit more playable for me. I still thing that they are both great games 'out of the box' and I think that Wrath is a bit superior to its predecessor.

I have probably played this at least ten times, so I have gotten some fun out of it.

Really enjoying this especially after the disappointment of Runebound which this shows up even more. Some nice character customisation, and plenty of action.  Only thing missing is some character development with only 1 lvl up for each character but you can't complain with a game length of just over an hour.

I play this with my young daughters (ages 11 and 9). We have a few house rules, and occasional ignore some effects (looking at you, poison traps), and it's awesome. Playing legit ranges from thrilling to annoying, depending on a lot of luck. Dice roles, bad draws on the encounters... so much can happen quickly to ruin an otherwise great session. With games lasting maybe an hour including set up, I find it best to adjust the rules for our family's fun. 

If you're looking for an RPG game you can play cooperatively, I can easily recommend Wrath of Ashardalon.

das Spiel ist so unspannend und untaktisch. Einfach reinrennen, soviele neue Felder aufdecken wie möglich. Taktik? Gruppenkampf?

RATING: 10
Super easy to set up, with high replayability. It was one of the first board games that I actively sought out to get, and have not regretted it to date.

Miniatures are fantastic quality, and the campaign is easy and fun to get into. Combat and creature placement is slightly wonky, but is easily overlooked with the fun this board game brings.

RATING: 7
Copied from my Drizzt review as the games are essentially the same.

A game with much potential but misses the target when it comes to gameplay. Lets start with the game's strengths, first off this is a fantastic looking game with outstanding and varied miniatures. There is more than sufficient variety in how each enemy plays to keep it interesting from that perspective. The tile placement mechanism for laying out the dungeon works well and does generate a genuine feel of exploration. The heroes are well balanced and each have their own feel and the general presentation is very good.

However, great miniatures do not a great game make. The initial set up can be quite time consuming as each player chooses their action cards, this is surprising given the lack of board set up time. Once play gets underway you quickly learn to despise the encounter deck.I can only assume that this clumsy tool was introduced to keep the adventurers on the move and to help balance the game with multiple players in the party but it ultimately ruins that game as it makes no sense thematically, simply forcing players to spend more time focusing on avoiding them than actually playing the game.


The second major flaw lies in the specific mission set up which is close to being brilliant, yet misses the mark totally. While they successfully create some level of story once you reach the objective, it's far too predictable up till that point, with eery single mission placing the objective somewhere between the 9th and 12th tile. This is a shame, because if some missions were longer than others or perhaps had multiple objective points, (say you find the door but can not pass until you recover the key from a second objective as a very simple example) as it stands you simply plod round the dungeon until the objective tile is laid then you play the specific end game.

The end game itself is always unique, well developed and thematically appropriate though.

I have played some thoroughly enjoyable games of Ashardalon, and with the right friends it can be a blast, but at the end of the day I can seldom get it on the table with either my children or games group who don't enjoy it much.

I really didn't like the lack-luster card presentation but the game itself was ok.  Feels like each game in the series kept getting a little bit better and despite having gotten rid of these games for Descent 2.0 I have recently picked up the 4th one in the series (The Temple of Elemental Evil) as I hear it adds a campaign system and such.  It may be that I'll need to re-acquire these other games if that tips the scales enough in the positive.  I did play some D&D back in the day, not a lot, but I also played a ton of the gold box version computer games so I have intimate familiarity with the classes and spells and such.  From that nostalgic standpoint the game works fairly well and feels a bit like D&D from a combat standpoint anyway.

In my youth, my friends and I would play D&D as often as possible. Many years have passed and there was always a desire to roll the old polyhedral again. Time, or the lack thereof kept us from playing. The D&D board game system's shorter setup and game play time gave us an opportunity to have some fun when a short window of gaming opportunity presents itself. 

Combined with elements from the other two sets and using our house rules.

A relatively light, thematic, fast paced dungeoncrawl. Suffers a bit from too many rule ambiguities, and requires a ridiculous amount of space.  There's a lot of dice rolling, as you'd expect from a dungeoncrawl,  but there are still tactical decisions to be made. I really like it.

Good character mechanics and nice figures meet boring, indistinguishable tiles and a lazy design.  The result is a forgettable game that does not simulate dungeon crawls.  I have played D&D for 30 years and I have never seen a dungeon with endlessly spawning traps.  It is a lazy solution for turtling.  And how pray tell do the monsters stay alive in this lethal funhouse for more than 10 minutes?  And why should monsters always act first, there is a mechanic called rolling for initiative look it up.

D&D plus Wizards of the Coast - publisher of Magic the Gathering.  They really know how to produce the best D&D game in a board wargame format.  Having watched Marco's review, this is on my list to purchase next. Random tile placement, party adventure in a highly thematic narrative story different each time as it goes, treasure items to collect after beating up the monsters, variable characters and class development, plus the visually appealing miniatures, what's not to like?

Everything good about Castle Ravenloft is even better now.  The characters are better balanced, the enemies are even harder, the tile design is even better, and the treasure deck finally makes sense.  The scenarios are a little lacking compared to Ravenloft's varied designs, but scenarios are also largely replaced by chambers, and the chambers are fantastic.  I cannot say enough good things about this mechanic, and I expect that any custom scenarios that come from this box will incorporate them ingeniously.  A better but harder game than Castle Ravenloft; heartily recommended.

Love the random dungeon generation and the potential in home brewing games when mixing all of the D&D Adventure games together. However, I don't have time or the will to create those house rules to elevate it to another level and therefore the game "out of the box" is too simple for my liking. Despite that it's a good gateway dungeon crawler.

I have a soft spot for these D&D dungeon crawls, but I will admit they are very basic. Adding the custom content, extra minis and just tricking it out are really a good time. But that might just be the nostalgia for kicking down a door, killing a monster, and taking the treasure.

Love this. A classic D&D romp, with a simple rules set. My son (5) helps out placing (playing with) the figures (but not the Grell or the Gibbering Mouther - they're too creepy ;)), drawing Monster cards, rolling the dice etc. It moves along at a quick enough pace that he stays engaged, which is great! 

The downside is that, once you get into it, the intricacies of the rules start to reveal themselves as fuzzy. You often find yourself making choices just because the rules didn't specify, clarify or edify in any way. That said, I forgive it. That kind of thing normally aggravates me, but not this time. Why? Probably because the heart of the game is simple and shines through all of that, and somehow you muddle through and those self-made rules choices seem to personalise the game somehow, which is in some way in the spirit of RPG's. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This series (which includes Castle Ravenloft and Legend of Drizzt) solves many of the problems with being a GM-less dungeoncrawl that plagued Warhammer Quest, most notably that there are AI scripts governing how enemies move and attack that are straightforward and easy to follow. The whole solution is rather elegant.

The series is let down a little by being a bit too streamlined. The campaign mode feels a little tacked-on, and there's no real way to develop your character through levelling. I'd love to somehow combine the dungeon generation/enemy AI aspect with the D&D core rules - that'd be brilliant.

Wrath of Ashardalon has a great set of miniatures, including a fairly impressive Dragon. The components are all of good quality and actually fit back in the box insert after punching.

The game seems difficult. My first solo play saw me get to the final room with a half dozen monsters in pursuit, and I'm curious to see whether the difficulty eases off a bit with more players. Certainly one significant flaw with the game is that some of the characters are clearly not intended for solo play, with abilities that mostly affect team-mates (some of the events do this too, by the way).

Wrath is a good follow-on to Castle Ravenloft.  I was really hoping for new character classes, but all they gave us was a Paladin instead of the (overpowered) Ranger from Ravenloft.

Although I wasn't enamored with Temple of Elemental Evil, I really enjoy Wrath of Ashardalon. The enemy theme and missions are fun, the minis are diverse and high quality, and the gameplay is smooth and easy to grasp. The hero abilities are great and range from powerful one-timers to spells that hit multiple enemies, you can even command enemies to attack each other! It's a bit of a bear to set up and takes up a large swath of real estate, but it's a great dungeon crawl that's perfect for when you're in the mood to slay some fantastic beasts.

Makes a few small improvements to Ravenloft, adding treasure, a semi-campaign mode, and more replayability in the form of randomized special tiles.

I love Castle Ravenloft, and Wrath of Ashardalon improves on it in some subtle ways while retaining everything that makes it great, so I love this game as well!

I really like the fact that the new PCs are very different from their CR counterparts, and in general I much prefer having an extra daily power and a weaker fixed ability to most of the fixed abilities CR characters get.

The vibe of the dungeon is more varied and interesting than CR (lots of different stuff vs. more undead), and I particularly like how many creatures add board sections with new creatures when they come out.

Like CR, WoA distills the only thing I like about D&D 4e -- the combat -- into a one-hour play experience, including the classic dungeon crawl feel, excellent co-op play, and just the right amount of randomness in dice, difficulty, and dungeon particulars.

Fantastic game, and inherently scalable: More PCs means more resources, but also more threats and more encounter cards. It's fun with two and with more -- no mean feat in a game like this.

I really enjoy the tile laying and watching the dungeon unfold as we explore deeper. I found the rules to be relatively simple, and a good entry point into the world of dungeon crawls. Characters had unique skill sets, giving the rpg vibe, without the intimidation of having to make one up yourself. I actually like that the characters don't upgrade at the end of the game, it keeps it nice and simple that way. You can take it back out and play where you left off, without having to adjust or remember stat increases. But at the same time, it does give you the ability to go up one level during the game. That was a nice deft touch. The minis add an excellent visual appeal to the game as well, including one Giant Ashardalon mini. I can see how the Flip a tile, Draw a monster mechanic can get a little samey, but i didn't find that it detracted from my gaming experience at all. I rather enjoyed the co-op gameplay, when traditionally i don't. I found that presenting the game as a group collaboration helped the game feel more epic and satisfying. This was my first game in the D&D series; which i chose because of its traditional theme.

5 / 5 - Great

Castle Ravenloft, it's predecessor was very good: a lightweight, open-ended dungeon crawl with tons of narrative and theme and just enough strategy to keep it interesting. This is better: it's more old school, slightly tougher, has a fun campaign system, more tactical hero powers and more variety. Best dungeon game ever in an otherwise stale genre. Excellent though these games in this series are I'm not yet convinced it's worth owning more than one - but currently this is the one to get.

Always love D&D theme, so good there. Great board, components and rulebook. 
But, it’s a co-op (quarterbacking). I like it solo though, so that mitigates this a little. 

The real problem is for all the randomness, it’s not really random. You fight monsters no matter what, and surface when you’re about to die. The dungeon layout didn’t really mater too much. But visually it rocks. 

It’s cool too because you can play it as an adventure or a campaign. If playing routinely with friends or a solo campaign, might be worth the hefty price – but if only once in awhile, maybe not.

Lots of figurines, well made.  Interesting characters and creatures.  Randomized dungeons and encounters and treasures a good idea.  Good number of scenarios to play.  Unfortunately, everything else about the game is terrible.  Bland and sparse art, low number of enemy types (due to limit of figurines), difficult and nonsensical combat and encounter rules.  Worst of all, extremely vague and poorly written rules and card text.  Poor, muddled overall game design leads to constant conflicts and questions, sending you do dig through the rules, FAQ's and online forums to figure out what the Hell the card you just drew actually does!  And then likely again on the next turn.  Slow, confusing, boring - wastes the potential of a great theme and some nice components.

I was completely indifferent to Ravenloft, as it seemed a bland and superficial dungeon-crawler, with low replayability. But because of the glaring reviews of Ashardalon and the promising changes to the system, I took a chance with this one, and I don't regret it a bit. It's a tight, fast-paced adventure playable in an hour, but gives enough variety both strategy- and storywise. The semi-scripted dungeon master works and balanced well enough, especially if played in the spirit of Arkham Horror- if you're in doubt what would an event/monster do, choose the one which screws with the party most. 

I didn't know that I've needed a fast, cooperative dungeon-crawler in my collection, but it's a much welcomed addition. I won't go back for Ravenloft though, but looking forward to Drizzt.

Fairly silly and random, with the typical dungeon that's crawling with bad guys who apparently live within a few feet of each other but never fight.

It's based on the deeply flawed D&D system, so that's obviously going to be a strike against it. It's not terrible, but it's really nothing special. It lacks the charm of, say, Dungeonquest, even though it's arguably deeper and less random.

I'd be willing to play it every now and then just for laughs.

Great intro D&D game.  A some of the mechanics are a little weird, but you get used to it eventually.  Fun intro to D&D for newbies.  Lots of variety in terms of setting up and play.  This game takes a LONG time to play.  Not good for a short gaming window.

This was an 8 for me for the longest time but dropping to a 6 now. I think I've only played 1 satisfying game of this in the last year and all the others have been long grinds where everyone just wishes it was over before we got to the end. I don't think any of the new players that were in any of those games would care to take it for another spin. The system feels clunky to me now that other more streamlined games have come out since 2011 and it's too easy to get in a game state that is a slow death spiral.

Has some interesting play mechanisms and design ideas.  Still WAY too much 4e for me though (narrative anyone?).  I prefer the old school flavors of Heroquest, DragonQuest, FirstQuest, or The New Easy to Master Dungeons & Dragons/Thunder Rift boxed game (or any D&D rpg prior to 3.0).  I liked it more than original Descent, which was way too overblown.  Minis were nice, as was the play time.

Finally, a successor to the glory that was Heroquest and Advanced Heroquest! This is a really good game and I highly recommend it for those who need a dungeon bash fix but don't have the time, the inclination, or the funds to get into Descent which is really for a harder core audience. To me, Wrath of Ashardalon fills the gap of wanting a simple, gorgeous, fun, dungeon cooperative game. Sure there are some small quibbles but all in all this should be a must buy if you like the genre. Get a copy before it goes out of print! In fact, this game could be a Descent killer, bringing fun dungeon bashing to the masses!

A fun little co-op romp. I particularly like that it managed to avoid the one-player-director syndrome of many other co-op games. Still, for the time it took, I would still rather get Descent to the table...

Still, it's a co-op, and yet another fantasy themed game. I have to ultimately go with "meh" here.

It fills a niche for an older D&D gamer like myself. I've been dying to play D&D again, but being a DM seems silly at my age unless playing with kids and nobody wants to be the bad guy against everybody else. A great fast paced game full of strategy. Lots of important decisions on every turn. Where you end your movement, how to deal with monsters, traps, villains and encounters and not wanting that 4hp elf in your party to explore is just part of the fun. 
It is a team game, you really have to work as a party and there is so much going on in each players area, it is impossible for anybody to take somebody else's turn. Generally you know what needs to be done on your turn anyway (some good ol' monster killin.)
 My fav part of this game is EASILY being able to run a campaign, come up with your own story with actual plot, character dialogue and such without having to change a thing about the game.

An OK game I guess? Imperial Assault does this infinitely better though. Also, I kinda dislike the encounter cards. "The walls are lava now! Now it's gone, but wait! Some other random event happens now that you totally couldn't prepare for!"

Game is hot trash. The rules are moronically hard to the point at which this is barely a game, and more of a slaughter. The minis are fantastic. I got this half price for like $25, painted the miniatures (there's a lot) and threw the game away. Now my real D&D games have great minis.

Extremely satisfied with this game. It's nothing like Dungeons and Dragons which is why I love it. Unlike D&D, it's fast-paced, fun, required no arbitrary judgements by an arbitrary and usually unqualified DM, there's constant hack and slash, just enough complexity to feel thematic, doesn't get bogged down by arbitrary rules, there is tactical choices but not enough meta-choices/choices about choices to "math out" and go into analysis paralysis a problem with Descent, a game which I love but suffers from that problem. This game is fun, and fast paced and really feels like you're going in there, killing the monsters, defeating the villian, completing the objective, exploring the dungeon, with just enough fluff and just enough mechanical/special ability differences between the different character classes, monsters, villians, and abilities of each class that it feels totally thematic. 

This is what Dungeon Crawls should have been. We want to get in there and fight the monsters and have enough time that we can feel like we can roleplay alittle without extending a game that's alright 4 hours. With this title, you can do everything and more all in a little over an hour and sometimes less, provided you're not playing with slow-ass idiots. In which case it will still be less than 2 hours.

Oh, and set up is quick and easy, and every component is beautifully crafted. The AI system of the monsters is just complex enough that you feel like there's a DM without being too complex that there's a sluggish gap in between each of the player's turns. I was thinking about Gears of War, but based on research decided to get this title instead. I'm really glad I did. Strongly recommended!

Love this game and am looking forward to the other titles in the D&D adventure system which I can combine with this.

A very distilled DnD in a box. It gets bonus points for doing a fair job streamlining it while keeping a lot of the ideas and excitement on a semi similar level and most of all, for being FULLY co op since most dungeon crawls are 1vAll. I think the balance can be a smidge off but it's still an enjoyable/okay game. The miniatures are cool and the tiles are a good size (albeit a bit too homogenous) and the items are fun to draw and such. Encounters give some excitement and tension, but still inferior to real DnD.

I like that I can use this material to run a DnD game too but not sure if Ill wanna play a lot and may trade still. Time will tell...

They need to start working on a harmonisation program for this game. There is SO much potential - but we need a box which brings it all together.

The lack of easy integration between treasure decks is a problem, as is the potential for super-powered heroes when you combine abilities for the same class.

Regardless, this box is MUCH better than Ravenloft and signals the potential this system has to emerge as THE coop game experience on the market.

Wizards, get some serious grunt behind this system and do it fast.

This is one of my go to games when I am home alone and bored and really want to play a creative, fun game.  For some reason I find it really easy to role play during this game, as opposed to others in my collection.  I also like that the game is flexible and modular, inviting opportunities to modify rules or create scenarios (much as D&D does).

I would have liked better art design on the tiles and cards, but on the other hand, too much specificity could have lowered the flexibility of the game. 

Now if I could just get the dice to stop hating me . . .

It's quite similar to the other Dungeons & Dragons games, [thing=91872]The Legend of Drizzt[/thing] and [thing=59946]Castle Ravenloft[/thing]. They are all basic dungeon delve cooperative games for those who prefer a fast simple experience. They are not great games, but they work.

I think this one has really powerful items as some of the treasures. I really liked it, even if the game might become a bit easier, because now you feel your character improves through the adventure.

This was my favorite dungeon crawler co-op till I played Pathfinder.  Now this is just a game I play if I want pathfinder, but something a little different and more one-shotty.

This game can accidentally kick your ass.  There can be tons of chaos involved.  But unlike Pathfinder, when I get my asskicked, I don't wanna come back for more.  I just pack it up and wipe my forehead.

It's tons of fun though and isn't replaced by Pathfinder.  It's still fun to have a bunch of amazing miniatures out, to have a bunch of spells/abilities to use, and interesting monsters roaming around.

This D&D boardgame series (Ravenloft, Ashardalon, Drizzt) fills a hole for when you want an RPG or dungeon crawl but no one wants to DM or you don't have any encounters drawn up. 

The set up can be a bit time consuming, but it isn't terrible once you've done it a few times. 

I feel like I haven't fully explored these games yet - there is a lot of user created content that I want to try when I get a chance. See: http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/59113/dungeons-dragons-castle-ravenloft-adventure-datab

A fun, simple 1-5 player cooperative dungeon crawler that can be played in under an hour (if everyone knows how to play)!

Unfortunately, there isn't much depth to the mechanics or enough variety in the heroes, enemies, villains, encounters, treasures, or scenarios to ensure any substantial replay value.

RATING: 7
Just as good as Castle Ravenloft. Mix the 2 games together to make the hero, monster, and treasure more varied.
The encounter deck in this set is nowhere near as scary as the one in Castle Ravenloft.
Only down side to this game is the HP counters. In CR they are yellow on one side and black on the other so when you take damage you can just flip them over and it is easy to see how much life someone has at a glance. The counters that came in this game are yellow on back. Very minor complaint.

I am enjoying this as a solo experience. It sets up fast, which is critical, and has plenty of atmosphere, another crucial element for solo games.

However it is really hokey. The dungeon is absolutely chock full of mixed nonsense: lava traps, rolling boulders, a whole menagerie of different monsters; it is reminiscent of a certain scene in Cabin in the Woods.

Also the rules are really sketchy. Pretty much every card you draw involves a bit of common sense house-ruling. I tend to be pretty harsh on myself since the worst outcome would be finishing the game with the nagging feeling that I had accidentally cheated.

Components are good. The minis are a bit soft, but the detail is pretty good. The tiles are really solid if a bit uninspired and samey. The cards a are a bit thin...

It sounds like all negatives but the game is light, quick and full of action. Overall great value and great fun.

RATING: 8
Exactly the same gameplay and feel as Castle Ravenloft, the differences being a different set of monsters plus the addition of some different coloured tiles to be added to the "chamber" tile when it's revealed, to make a bigger chamber full of monsters at the end for some scenarios. As such, it remains a likeable co-op which gets a bit same-y though from turn to turn as you progress through a scenario. Move, whack a monster with a die roll, add a tile to the dungeon, reveal another monster, monsters do their move or whack as per their instructions on their card. The group decisions are to split up or stay together, what to explore, who's going to whack what in what order (ie there's not a real lot there). Life gets more or less difficult for you depending on the die rolls and which monsters get revealed. It's pleasant enough if you ham it up enough. But no need to own both unless you're a completist, and you'd get this (of the two) for the extra bits.

What I liked:
- D&D theme, dungeon tiles, and miniatures
- Pure co-op

What I didn't like:
- Relentless monsters and negative events
- 2 hours felt long (5p learning game)
- Tile-based movement and effects

This didn't really feel like D&D to me. It felt like one long encounter set up by a really mean DM. Even though we barely won (or barely lost if we hadn't forgotten to move the dragon one time), it didn't feel like victory. There was no sense of exploration or progress--it was all about survival.

The BGG-voted weight of 2.6 seems about right.

Pros:
+Lots of minis

Cons:
-Rulebook is simple but very vague in spots which can lead to confusion
-Theme is a bit overused
-Tiles are a little lame looking and don't really show any cool artwork

Comments: Solo is fun but can be a little overwhelming if the board gets flooded. 2-3 people seems to be a sweet spot for this. Also, this game is growing on me. Could see this getting stale without CR or LoD.

RATING: 6.5
I like the newer character, villain, and monster additions.  I also like how it better balances the encounter pile and has more interesting tiles.

The game is a lot more tedious than Castle Ravenloft.  Too many of the enemies and encounters bring out tiles from the bottom of the deck, significantly increasing the game, dragging it out, before the payoff vs the boss.  This has become a huge negative.  Additionally, the treasures are now items and switched to a treasure token to buy them, however that's been a problem for those who don't campaign, which this game tries to force.

Not as awful as I first thought, like that's high praise.

It works, but it's short and tedious at the same time. Average as average can be.

Component quality is an easy 9 out of 10.  Gameplay however is about a 4 to me.  It's really terrible.  Either a monster or an encounter, every turn sometimes both.  For a tactical game, it has surprisingly no tactics.  May have been a great play in 1985 when this type of gameplay came out, but the lack of up to date design in this random-fest is showing it's age in a very bad way.

The theme and the components make me want to love this so badly.  I have completed 2 games.  I have started 10 games...it is painful to try to even finish it's so not fun and fiddly.

This is essentially the same basic game mechanics of D&D Castle Ravenloft, but with some added interesting stuff. Overall the characters on WoA seem to be more powerful overall. Second, this seems more tailored for riches and other extra goodies that people are more attracted to. In Ravenloft, surviving was the main goal of many missions. Here you would be able to collect some stuff to brag, which probably will get some of the people that were on the fence or that wanted some of that Descent vibe of progressing their character. Overall, I bit better of a game than Ravenloft, but not by much.

Fast paced D&D-ing, to be played with a group who enjoys its dungeon crawling. I really didn't like the artwork and quality of the cards.

I'm sorry I didn't get to paint the minis.

brings out the nerd in me =)

If you're looking for a fun co-op or solo game, this is what you are looking for.

The game works by drawing interlocking dungeon tiles randomly to create a new dungeon each time. Most adventures have you place an objective tile in your tile deck. Then when you lay down that objective tile, the adventure rules tells you what happens (usually a boss battle).

The game comes with 13 adventures, but it's super easy to make your own. Or if you just want to kill some monsters, throw a chamber tile in your dungeon tile deck and when you explore to that chamber tile, draw a chamber card to see what happens.

This game is like a cliff notes version of a D&D dungeon crawl. It's fun for what it is, but lacking in depth. I think the fantasy setting benefits more from this system than the gothic horror setting of Castle Ravenloft, where players felt the lack of atmosphere more acutely. 
Heroes, Monsters, Treasure; it's all here and can be played solo in about an hour. Though mechanical, and no replacement for real RPG'ing, it will scratch the dungeon crawl itch if you're jonesing for a fix.

Fun dungeon crawl.  I play solo with 3 characters.  Mechanics of drawing Encounter cards when not searching makes it a race against the clock, often getting you into protracted battles with multiple enemies across many tiles.  Nice minis.  Many people will want to adopt some house rules to get to the right level of fun.

After playing Ravenloft, TOEE, and Ashardalon (no Drizzt yet) I gotta say this is my favorite of the bunch.  They're all good, but I like the minor campaigning found here and I also found the monster and encounter mix to be the best.  

Any one in the D&D series is good, but this is the best.

I suppose if I had to play a dungeon crawler, it'd be this one - it's quick. But you really need to be 14 to enjoy D&D board games. There's just not enough to think about, and killing monster miniatures and co-operative gaming really isn't my thing. Combat is fast, but repetitive. I think I'd enjoy it more with less players.

Is basically the same as the other games in this series, not worth purchasing if you have the other games unless you want the extra minis, or you want to combine the two into a more massive dungeon.

The game is very simple.  
Set up game tiles.
Reveal one per turn, walk a bit, roll a dice to see if you defeat a monster, draw a card to see what event happens to you, rinse and repeat.

There are so many games which do this better, the only reason I think this games sells is because of the name recognition and/or minis.  Unless you're a DnD fanboy/fangirl, or need a game that's really simple, do yourself a favor and look into any one of these games instead for a more interesting experience:
Drakon (simpler, but much more fun with multiple people)
Descent 1st or 2nd edition (more complicated, but also a much richer dungeon crawl)
Space Cadets: Away Missions (way different theme, but much better mechanics)

More of the same, though with some small but significant improvements (Chambers, pseudo-campaigns etc).  Clear guidelines on how to mix and match this with Castle Ravenloft will be the key to getting the best from this system (not sure on the balance of the different heroes, for example).  I like the fact that WoA clearly does not replace CR (and therefore make it obsolete), but simply adds to it.  Worth picking up even if you have CR.

A solid entry level dungeon crawler with easy to learn mechanics and great exploration rules and monster AI.

Beware though despite it being a great entry level game it is also a very hard game and a few unlucky card draws can really destroy you.

After this try Gears of War as it is similar in many ways but more complex and you can control the luck aspects more in that game.

Nice,easy to learn, fast dungeon crawler - well, more like a skirmish game.

10-11-2014. Uprated back to 8 in September. I like the game, but it was not for me. It's left my collection due to tthe little table time it was expected to get, but I've lliked it and ratings should reflect that I think. It certainly fills a niche (cooperative dungeon crawlers) that are not often filled (except by Myth).

02-06-2014. Downgraded to rating of a 7, from an 8.5. I do not have a very large collection, but I haven't played this game in 6 months.. maybe longer. I don't have unlimited shelfspace, and while I still really like the game I've decided to get rid of my copy. Also, I have acquired a copy of Myth, and already own Descent 1.0/2.0 (also nightkit) and Level7: Omega Protocol. While the latter two games contain overlords, I still rather play those over this one. 

20-01-2014. Ashardalon I like best of the DnD games. I am a sucker for Dungeoncrawling and having it in a coop variant with DnD makes it a tough game to beat. I owned both Drizzt and Ravenloft and parted with those 2, keeping Ashardalon. I like the Dragon (duh) and cleric character in this game better than what both other games had to offer.

In general, I will say that I like games like Descent better than I like pure coops like DnD, since you can banter and attack another player and not a board. If I am in the coop mood, this is definitely a game I'll play any time :).

I had high hopes for this D&D series but its really simple. I mean, far too simple. The simplicity doesnt stop there, the way the phases work is rubbish and every enemy having a bonus to hit score just means that the playtesting was never done very well. Avoid this series if you actually like boardgames because this really is nothing other than a pretty box on the shelf.

WARNING: 
If you think this is similar to real D&D roleplaying -- you're wrong, sorry. This is simply a modular boardgame that also implements the D20 die-roll system (e.g. in combat) and happens to include terms you might've heard in connection with roleplaying, although they are not at all used in the same way in this boardgame. 
If you can deal with such premise, this game will prove to be very fun and exciting!

Got this basically for free because of customer discount at my FLGS.
Very nice components, sturdy boards, nice miniatures and a plethora of cards & tokens. Good box insert to store it all. The core rules are easy, but a little ambiguous sometimes. It's a great co-op game to play with kids. Varied Adventures and random dungeon exploration give this great replay value.
It can be fiddly at times, because of the many tokens.

This is probably the happy medium of the D&D adventure games, one with all of the simplicity of Castle Ravenloft, and just a little more flavor. I think I like Legend of Drizzt best still, but they all run together so smoothly and all have the same intuitive no-nonsense approach to a genre that is commonly tripping over its own feet.

Nice expansion - adds in new stuff, but generally more of the same. I can't comment on whether it's effective at getting you into the game.

However, it's one of the few expansions which adds a rule that significantly detracts from the base game - the regulations on where you can move monsters. I don't play with it, and don't see why anyone would!

This is a players vs. the system cooperative game of dungeon crawling and combat. Players choose from 5 different characters each granting a unique ability to the group. Players will select a scenario to play through which will determine the starting position of the board and set out the victory conditions. The map is randomly determined by using a set of square tiles, ensuring that each tome the game is played the experience will be different. 

When monsters are revealed a card is drawn and a figure is placed on the board. The monster's card determines how they act when activated, by listing their tactics.  Players who found the monster "own" the monster and only activate them at the end of their turn, or if another player has an identical monster.  The players lose if anyone dies, and with only 2 healing surges available that is a likely outcome. The game is challenging but not insurmountable nor formulaic.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
More great miniatures, interesting mix of monsters, tweaks to the tiles and the inclusion of doors handled very well. Treasure deck seems to have gone from under- to over-powered, but that's actually perfect for the purpose of combining the two decks. In general, it is impressive how well this game stands on its own AND combines and complements Ravenloft. 

I like the action pose on the half-orc character, and he has some pretty neat abilities. Introduction of gold for purpose of campaigns of multiple adventures is a neat touch - not being able to level up beyond 2? Pfft, don't care. The notion that a 'campaign' would be an evening of 3 or 4 adventures back-to-back makes a lot more sense to me than something of the scope of an RPG or Road to Legend. 

For those who really do want a dungeon-crawler that'll play in under an hour, and which once painted looks pretty, this franchise is going from strength to strength.

What really does surprise me is that the changes from Ravenloft seem to have been made in response to some of the criticisms/suggestions after that game - with the timeframe between releases, that is very impressive, and bodes particularly well for the next game in line.

Edit (July 2011): Shaved a point off my rating of this because, in spite of the improvements, in spite of the more classic D&D mix of monsters,I am finding that I somewhat prefer Ravenloft. One factor is the treasures in Ashardalon, which multiply through the game. The too much fiddling about with cards phenomena is worsened by the things like the Event cards that stack the deck for certain monsters - they seem a bit on the pointless side. The adventures don't feel like they have the same degree of character and appeal as Ravenloft, perhaps just being a touch clunkily and unimaginatively written. Yeah, not like Ravenloft's writing would go up against Vance or Wolfe, but there's something indefinable there that gives me a preference for the first game. Perverse, I know. I do like the doors and the horrid chambers.

Edit, October 2011: Sold/traded to acquire Dreadfleet, Waterloo and Shogun. I am still a bit in shock that I did this, as I really like the game and painting the minis was a labour of love, but faced with the need to get rid of something big to get spousal approval for Dreadfleet acquisition, I couldn't help but reflect that I just prefer Ravenloft, and as good as this is, I just don't need two D&D boardgames. I will miss it, but I think the new games will help me get over that. After all, I've had this 10 months, and only played it twice in all that time. Ashardalon Farewell!

Slightly better than Castle Ravenloft, which I already thought was an excellent cooperative game.  WoA possesses a significantly better treasure deck, even more frustrating (in a good way) encounters (like moving traps), thematically consistent and tactically challenging monsters, and powerful, ass-kicking heroes. The Chambers are also a neat idea, and create a more epic end-game.  I'm not sure about Doors yet, but if you really need something to make things more difficult...

I'm guessing that this will be similar to the D&D 'starter' kits that WOTC have been pushing in various iterations over the last few years.

The only difference? Extra chrome and bits. 

Perhaps the DM will be replaced with a preset scenario that players can regulate themselves. 

Update:
After getting Castle Ravenloft, I'm half-right. It's not so much a D&D starter kit than a D&D miniatures game.

The DM has indeed been replaced with preset scenarios that players regulate.

It fails to deliver on narrative. At least in the first two missions. That is pretty poor when you consider the nature of the game.

Is this game even winnable? 2 players get overwhelmed VERY quickly. The monsters/encounters/traps are just too powerful and fast become too numerous to overcome. Every decision you make = punishment.

Acquired in trade with Arkham Horror, for Evolution and Merchants & Marauders.

Have only played solo, but I'm enjoying it immensely.  To me, this is what a solo game should be:  quick setup and tear down, challenging, fun, flavourful.  Nearly every other solo game I've ever played just wasn't worth the time investment in setup and teardown.  This one is.

Need to go back and revisit the Drizzt version... didn't have the best of experiences with it a couple years ago, but I think I have the rules down pat now and could have a lot of fun with the right crowd.

Very fun game, however it takes quite a long time to play. If it is your first time playing start with one of the early adventures and make sure you have 3-4 hours of time if you want to complete the adventure. I recommend this game for any group that wants a tough, frustrating, and satisfying experience.

Solo play is pretty limited, as there is only one *official* solo adventure, and many of the characters' abilities and monster mechanics rely on there being other characters to work properly. A much better game with more players, though the play time definitely increases.

RATING: 6
A fun dungeon-crawler which doesn't require a player to act as GM. Many of the rules come from 4e D&D, so it's best to play with people who already know that system. It's the most straightforward game in the series. I'd recommend getting Legend of Drizzt first.

I like this one as well!  It brings a lot of new and interesting elements, and a great expansion to the number of potential characters.  The campaign rules are half-baked, but at least an attempt was made to have them.  I think a lot of folks wanted this series to be the second coming of War Hammer Quest and were very let down when it wasn't.  I'm glad I view on its own terms, and I'm more happy with it than not.

RATING: 7
I really wanted to like this game because I want to have a solo dungeon crawl game.  I played the first Descent and liked the tactical options it just took way too long, didn't like how "death" was handled, no one wanted to be the overlord, and did not seem balanced.

The D&D games look great, play solo (no DM required), and have nice miniatures.  I liked the idea, but didn't like the execution.

The game just doesn't offer decisions on a tactical level that I want.  I guess I want to be able to control my hero like I did in Descent but have the game come with an AI that feels more sophisticated.  I have traded WoA for Gears of War and so far I like the AI much better.

Another aspect of WoA I did not like was the encounter cards.  I don't mind getting smashed in a game but the encounter cards felt random (didn't fit in with the adventure) and took away any sense of exploration.

I also did not care for the scenarios.  They all seemed the same.

My search for a tactical solo dungeon crawl continues.  I didn't back Myth because I want to see reviews first.  In the meantime I have Zombicide and Gears of War.  Space Hulk and Claustrophobia make for pretty good solo games as well.

This is better than Ravenloft, and I *loved* Ravenloft. Still, what's best is to own both.

I haven't been this impressed with a box of goodies since "Game of Thrones" back in '03. Piles of minis, lots of counters, hundreds of cards. 

The gameplay isn't as bad as reported: especially since I play the monsters "mean," trying to kill those heroes. My son loves it - it's replaced Heroquest as the "king of games." 

For someone with a child who wants an adventure game, it's awesome. I'm not sure I'd like to play it with adults - it's hard to take it seriously, somehow.

RATING: 5
After playing dungeon & dragons campaign at local store... this Ashardalon cant really be compared to that in terms of complexity and experience.

When I bought this, I want "dungeon crawling" genre game, while this one is dungeon crawling, but it doesnt really scratch that itch... I want to get stronger by exploring and getting treasures also defeating bad guys... but the game made it hard because of the... i forgot... event cards???, they make me cant explore too much.

Its made simple and easy to learn, sure thats a great point, but im ready for something more complex when playing RPG type boardgame.

Also the max level is just 2 and starting from 1... weird... I want more levels and more stats...

while this game had great minis and great campaign from what i read in the campaign book guide, i dont think this is really a dungeon crawling game that I searched for... maybe Im going to try mageknight next or maybe pathfinder ACG.

(After second play, we also just barely wins... i still stand at my point above... while my friend seems to enjoy the experience, i'm not, coz i'm not excited going into new scenario game with level 1 again...)

RATING: 6.5
As a veteran D&D player, I don't find the game itself outstanding in any manner. However, a dungeon that manages itself, leaving all players to work together as heroes is nice and it still does give you a good feeling of a co-op dungeon gauntlet.

I do recommend this (as well as Legend of Drizzt and Castle Ravenloft) as RPG budget start-up boxs. Each box gives you an excellent value's worth of miniatures (both hero options and theme monster forces) and the clip together dungeon tiles are a starting DM's best friend. Much easier than hunting individual minis and repeatedly drawing new maps for your first campaign.

A must buy for a D&D fan. This game features great mechanics. The villains' AI is evolved, as the pre-customised tactics allow the player to control the villains. Solo game is nice, though I believe that a complete party would be more fan.

Beware though, the luck factor is crucial, as a bad draw could end your game very very early.

Well,

its presentation is extremely gorgeous (at least the miniatures). The rules however feel a little rough and "clumsy". What about traits like dexterity, charisma,courage etc.? The die rolls you make are a bit monotonous, which doesn't contribute a whole lot to creating an atmosphere here. What about line of sight? Surely not a bad game for the dungeon crawlers,but there's not much tension nor storytelling to my mind.

RATING: 6.5
I have played its brothers: [thing=59946][/thing] and [thing=91872][/thing]. I can't really say if something was unique to this entry - to me, it all seemed the same as before.

[thing=66356][/thing] is a good cooperative game that has the plus (for me) of the D&D theme. The 4th edition rules, though I despise it for my RPG sessions, work really well in the board game format. It is simple enough to teach and to learn. Basically, the game goes like this:

- Hero phase (walk + attack; attack + walk; or walk twice). The attacks and actions come mostly in the form of at will powers; daily powers and utility powers;

- Explore phase. If the hero ends his turn besides one unexplored edge of the map, a new tile is put in that place. Usually a monster will appear on it. If the tile has a black arrow, an Event card will also be revealed in the proper phase. If a new tile wasn't revealed, an Event will be drawn.

- Villain phase. The monsters that are in front of the player activate, following the AI in the card of them (usually: if adjancent to a hero, do X; if a 1 tile away from closest hero, do Y; if 2 or more tiles away, do Z). Also, an Event card is drawn, if is meant to be.

This repeats until the scenario ends in defeat or victory for the heroes. By killing monsters, the heroes gain treasure and experience. Experience can be used to level up (if a player rolls a natural 20 while attacking or disarming a trap), at the expense of 5XP; or can be used to cancel an Event, also at the cost of 5XP.

The production value is high - the minis are beautiful and the components give your money worth.

There is a good deal of luck in the game (dice rolls, blind draft of enemies, treasures, and so forth), that isn't far off what you will encounter in many RPG sessions.

This, nonetheless, isn't an RPG. No roleplay is required.

Being a mission-based game usually meant that the game isn't all that high in the replay value department, but since the game has a lot of random aspects, I guess this game can have more replay value than usual.

Finally, theme-wise, the game works-ish. The theme sure is there. But some things are less than perfect - mostly due to the mechanics (a normal thing), but the treasure deck causes some shills to my thematic-bones, like a wizard wielding a mace or a warrior rocking a wand. I also don't particularly like that traps only work on heroes, even when they are, well, right there. Sure, the monsters could know that a trap is in place, and won't activate it, but when a huge ball is rolling, it won't avoid the monsters, nor the lava will.

Finally, all my plays lasted way more than 60 minutes - so be aware of this.

WoA takes everything in Castle Ravenloft, and tunes or turns it up. Still true to CR's core: It's fast. It's flexible. It's fun. Still on & off the table in an hour or so. 
It's now an Adventure System with each game compatible with the others in the system. Instabuy for folks that enjoy CR. Great intro/gateway for folks that would like to sort of 'work up to' heavier RPG's like D&D.

I love a lot about this game, but there are two drawbacks that hold it at a 7.  The first thing is the enemy movement; I'm not sure what could be done, I just know the methods of activating and moving enemies was stiff.  The second thing I see as a drawback is that exploration is slow and dull.  Give me less monster generation, less bad events, more incentive to explore the dungeon.

Jury still out on this one.  I keep coming back to it, and once you get the hang of it it flows nicely.  But for crying out loud, those encounters!  RELENTLESS.  How are there ANY MONSTERS LEFT in this mountain with all those bastard traps?  Would like an expansion set which consisted of nothing more than 20 blank encounter cards.  Also, it gets easier when you have more players, as you then have more turns in between each monster's turn.  That's a bit of a flaw - it should scale to the number of players.  And - stop me if I'm boring you - the monsters always get the first hit.  And finally, there is an unnecessary lot of house-ruling that needs to happen to avoid rule contradictions and ambiguity.  

Having said all that, where's my sword?  I'm going in!

Had to apologize to my group for putting this on the table. There's no strategy to it, even though it looks like there is. There's definitely no role play, even though it has the name of a role playing game on it. I can't understand the appeal.

My first entry into owning a dungeon crawl game. The rules are a bit open-ended and unclear which knocks the rating down a notch for me. The game, however, is very fun. The components are top-notch and I felt I got my money's worth. I love coops and this is great with friends or solo. Best part is that most games come down to the wire. Lots of tension and challenge.

I enjoy these D&D games more than I expected to!

Great for something quick and accessible when Descent seems a bit too heavy. It may just be D&D simplified, and there's a lot of randomness but if you can embrace that, it's a fun time. Tough sunnovabeech too.

Edit: Traded. No-one else liked it.

Update (rating down by 2).
After more playtime, it looses some of its charm. Still a good game.

RATING: 7
Initial rating: I knew what kind of game I was getting into when I bought this for my 5 year old son. After playing the introductory mission, I was impressed with how much fun the game is.

I'm an old pen and paper player, so I knew that this game wouldn't be the same, but it sure feels like it. It's organized so well. The game moves so quickly and fluidly. And it gives me the same feeling.

Looking forward to playing with some adults.

UPDATE: Having played a three player with adults, I must say that this really is a fun game. We even played incorrectly, making the game easier, but it was still a blast. The components are great. I look forward to buying the other games in the series. 

And my son loves the game. Perfect.

A well worthy RPG boardgame based on the original D&D concept. Plenty of miniatures, cards and components. Good quality. Even the scenarios are few there is re-playability due to variety of dungeons tile deployment. A best buying game in this category!!!

It's a very standard dungeon crawler. Decent quality minis. Nothing particularly exciting. I'm a huge fan of D&D and Forgotten Realms so I don't mind so much that the game isn't amazing.

After first game: This is fun dungeoncrawling with friends. We killed only small monsters in this scenario and cant wait to get in fights against real badasses. Feels like a game I could even play solo. Maybe I'll buy Drizzt... :S

First impressions are of a fun game, with a very shoddily written set of rules with far too many ambiguities in the book and on the cards. I'm not sure how much variety there is in the scenarios, I suspect it's going to be a similar dungeon bash every time.

Sold at Pasteboard & Plastic 7/7/12.

I like the chamber concept a lot. What is worse than spawning 5 monsters in one exploration and a villain in the middle? The Dragon is cool too. Easier than Castle Ravenloft. Shines when combined with the other games in Epic mode.

After the low water mark set by Ravenloft the boardgame, I will pass here. My aim is to break out the [i]actual[/i] D&D RPG if I get the desire for some cod-medieval fantasy action.

RATING: 7
I find the D&D co-op games enjoyable... and I think Wrath is better than Ravenloft, if only because there are more interesting things in the dungeon (doors, long hallways, chambers), though the heroes in Ravenloft by in large feel more classic... This certainly scratches my dungeon crawling itch very nicely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I really like the addition of Chambers and doors. The new characters and monsters are cool too. They really did a justice to the game by adding much better items and by not including more fortunes and blessing cards. Combining the treasure cards from Castle Ravenloft and WoA is the way to go. The encounter deck isn't as brutal as the one found in CR which may/may not be a good thing.

Kinda cool, fairly simplistic dungeon crawler, with lots of cool pieces, lots of cards, nice artwork etc

However, the game takes a long time to play with little reward. For such a large scale game, it's too simplistic. The "AI" behaves in a very straight forward, relentless manner. You have little time to breathe and reflect on the game, you just get attacked by a constant stream of monsters and traps. The gameplay can actually be quite difficult and I don't find it very rewarding as the character advancement is too limited - You can only level up once.

The best thing is, you don't need a dungeon master as the game uses a kind of scripted playstyle for the monsters. However as previously stated, it's a double-edged sword.

All-in-all it's a decent game, but I'll be trading it for Descent 2 when I get the chance!

Nekem a dungeon crawler 1 játék után nem fekszik, nem is kell túl komolyan venni a pontszámot. Ettől függetlenül majd próbálkozom még egyszer vele, mert az első játék körülményei nem voltak optimálisak.

Not my favorite in the series but definitely a good game.  Played with Sam (chip spitter), Jordan, Steven (new guy) and I.  Jordan REALLY mucked up the rules but we got through it and actually survived (barely).  This version is much harder than Ravenloft; I would rather play Ravenloft though due to the theme.

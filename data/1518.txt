[ESP] Durante el juego se deben comprar materias primas, las que posteriormente servirán para producir bienes. Sin embargo todo se hace en el mercado a base de especulación.
Cada mes se hace una apuesta de cuantas materias primas se desea comprar y a qué precio. Mientras más grande sea la demanda de ella, mayor será su precio, y si lo que yo estaba dispuesto a pagar no alcanza, no podre comprar ninguna.
Lo mismo (pero al contrario) ocurre con la venta de bienes.
Juego interesante pero algo tedioso. Demasiados cálculos involucrados lo que lo hace lento.

ENGLISH:
It's a good game, very interesting. The problem is that after the 4 month you wish it will be over son. Too many calculations involve makes it a slow and exhausting game.

This copy was apparently never played: All the money and certificates were never removed from their pads, the score pad is unused, and the black marker for the board still has its factory-sharpened tip. Shelf wear is negligible. Just an absolutely pristine copy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A seriously under the radar game which showcases Sackson at his most austere and fascinating. The game mechanics are deceptively simple: buy raw materials, create finished products, try to make money over the long haul. The more raw materials of a given type that people buy, the more the price is inflated. The more of a given end product that is sold, the more it devalues. Basic math and economics, but it creates an extremely compelling game experience.

Note that there is significant room for skulduggery in both the buy and sell phases, as it is possible to use otherwise extraneous purchasing power to drive up the price on given goods but demanding them at the minimum price when you know the other players are interested. Similarly, it is possible to drive down the value of end products if you have spare raw materials by "trying to sell them" at outrageous prices.

This is a nasty game with interesting player interactions. My only real problem is that it seems to play a bit too long for what it is, but the beauty of the long game is that the market has a chance to play itself out fully. Great game though, well worth picking up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Good economic simulation.

However, the designer has put minimal effort in creating a theme. The "product" in the game is a generic widget!

The lack of theme really takes out some of the enjoyment. As a result, the game could also feel a bit too long.

So simple that you can even call it poor. But the idea is clean and elegant. Useful for teachers as an explaining tool. Helps to show how the stock market functions.

Thanks to its polish release back in the 80's it was one of the first board games (apart from chess and checkers) I have ever played.

A stimulating brain bender, no doubt, with typical Sackson thoughtfulness. But too much time is spent in silent contemplation of what each other is going to do than in actual meaningful interaction. Also plenty of logpad work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is not highly rated on BGG, with a lot of people calling the game "work" and "bone dry". There is a lot of math constantly throughout the game. But we found the game to be very dynamic, with a lot of indirect player interaction, opportunities for price manipulation, bluffing, optimization, and numerous strategic options - all tied around a very simple framework that is surprisingly smooth and effective. 

Playing the full 12 months runs almost 3 hours, which is a bit long, but you do want time for the market to develop some trends. 8 months might be the happy medium.

Definitely (like many Sackson games) ahead of its time, and still playable.  Many will tell you that it's dry, and I suppose that it's true, though if not being dry involves fantasy or sci-fi themes, then I'd prefer a dry game.

The calculation is kind of fun and it seems like a chore to be really profitable.  I like the second guessing nature of the game as well.  It does seem a little too easy to purposely mess with your opponents by skewing the market, but doing so sacrifices your own productivity at the same time.

The main problem with the game is that it's too long to play very often.  But every once in a while I'd be happy to play it.

A clever mechanism in search of a game.

There's just not enough here.  Submit a sealed bid, hope you eluded the groupthink.  Sometimes your psychic intuition pays off and you luck into a bonanza of raw materials, other times you're shut out.  Rinse and repeat 24 times.

This might be an interesting mechanism to include in a larger game (imagine this as the market for materials in Power Grid, for example), but on its own it is repetitive and boring.  Drip, drip, drip, drip.

I want to like this game--it's one of Sid's after all--but each time we've played it's been a bust. The game components are bland to a fault and the constant arithmetic gets very tedious. We stopped our last game after only five months (turns), which was a relief to all. I don't often chime in with the "this would be better on a computer" crowd, but yeah, this would be better on a computer. [2 plays; will there be another? unlikely]

Possibly the first word that comes to mind when glancing at Executive Decision's artwork is "drab". The first word that comes to mind when reading its ruleset is "dry". The first thought after a couple of turns might be "boring", and the first thing most people would need beside them for playing might be a calculator. With its stripped-down economic theme, a rock-paper-scissor mechanism and a deliberately serious presentation, Executive Decision is both barren and uninviting.

Nevertheless, something as simple as supply and demand rising and lowering the prices of materials to be bought and products to be sold leaves lots of room for speculation and bluff, and something as simple as the right timing to buy materials and to sell products leaves nearly as much room for planning. Short-term, mid-term and long-term strategies are possible, since players can organize the business year to block opponents' transactions, load up on certain materials or keep all quantities even to disguise future plans, sell products slowly or quickly to inflate the prices, build up a cushion of money towards the end of the game... 

...Executive Decision is a very strong meal - it might be best to start with six or nine months since a whole year can be quite exhausting. Funnily enough, it's more comfortable to play just with pencil and tally sheets. Bank notes and material certificates slow the game down and don't improve much in terms of atmosphere (they can't, really).

Executive Decision is hilariously dry (Sackson & 3M didn't even bother to theme it: you are buying materials X-Fine, Fine, and STD to produce goods A, B, and C). Though at first it was pretty confusing, and we even lost one player due to boredom, slowly the game's elegance showed itself. It's actually a very interesting player-driven economy which I've never really seen before in a game to this scale. Supply and demand fluctuate rapidly depending on your purchases. I would happily play this again.

It's been years since I've played it, but I remember being impressed by the mechanics wherein each player's buying and selling influenced the value of the goods.  I played Palmyra recently and it reminded me of this game.  Update: a serious brain-burner that probably works best with four to six.  With three the possibilities are somewhat calculable, but even then it's tough to predict.  Would really like to play again!

Always seemed like a serious board game for adults when I played it with my family as a teenager. A solid game in the 3M line, but much too dry for me to find it interesting nowadays.

I bought this from eBay on a whim, and because it's a Sid Sackson game. I've played it two-player once. And despite the theme, it was more enjoyable than I thought it'd be. I can't see playing this very often, and it's probably too long, but don't underestimate Sackson's design capabilities.

I have only played this 2 player.  That may explain why I dislike the game so much.  I may give it another try someday with more players.  Or not.

Got this along with a bunch of other 3M's when they first came out.  We played this a fair amount, but liked Facts in Five, Acquire and Stocks and Bonds better.

Considerably better than Avalon Hill's Management (which it resembles), and not without interest. However, it's quite repetitive and dry.

Shows its age in components and ridiculously granular money system, but feels very modern in terms of mechanics.  There's a reason that Sid Sackson is regarded as the best example of early modern game design, and this is a great showcase of his abilities.  There's subtlety here in predicting the actions of other players, and it's a nice balance of being sure to get what you need, while trying not to overpay, and even getting a deal on some spare materials here and there.  Absolutely worth playing.  I'd suggest using the expert variant, because it takes away the temptation to do ridiculous market shenanigans that make the game much less fun.

Best part of this game is the ridiculous guy on the cover.  Check out the mustache!

I was actually surprised at how clever and captivating this was despite being a relatively austere old school game. My initial impression is that the full game is too long- but ostensibly there's nothing lost by playing only 6 months instead of 12. For those who like supply and demand market dynamics this is a must-try.

Ok it does not look good - but what did in 1971? There are a lot of calculations -  I did not calculate everything to the nth degree when I was deciding what to buy and sell, I did it by 'feel'.  I think it is a good game though - bluff, taking chances, trying to tactically change the prices. Would like to play again soon.

This game settles into a sweetspot of being a bit to dry for casual gamers and lacking enough depth to keep the business majors entertained. I wasn't sure what to do to have fun with this, so I resorted to casual sexism and calling my female friend "sweetheart" while suggesting she make us some coffee. She threw a pencil at me, and then we all just sat around wearing ties and tossing the fake money in the air, shouting, "BUSINESS!

RATING: 5
A dry and fairly repetitive game (since you play 12 rounds of it to simulate a year worth of buying and selling).  While I am not adversed to doing math calculations when playing, however, after so much of it I am not sure if there is actually any strategy involved, or if the game simply rewards the better guesser.

Brilliant, light card-play with a heavy dose of delicious chance, but plenty of decisions to be made too. The graphic design looks boring at a first glance, but serves the game perfectly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Certainly charming in its simplicity and straight forward play. Very clean graphic design albeit dark in its over use of reds and blacks. Nice idea with the exchange token but uncomfortable in drawing from the discards (i.e. you can redraw a card just played). So not at all bad and enjoyable in the easy space intended, but not something I need to own.

Decent quick filler game, though it's hard to tell how random it is.  The production value is actually really nice and the game's decently satisfying but the randomness inherent in grabbing cards off the deck can be sorta frustrating.

That said, for it's length you could do a lot worse and the trade tokens work really nicely.  The trade mechanics are clever and I'm surprised that particular bit hasn't been done too much in other games.

Takes the set collection and track placement of Ticket to Ride, makes it more random, and gets rid of the strategic portion of the game, the destination tickets. Furthermore, it adds randomly beneficial cards and an unnecessary card exchange system.

A friend of mine backed this on Kickstarter, and I was happy to give it a whirl – I didn’t expect much, and although it isn’t the next big filler, it’s decent enough. 

It has simple rules (although there was some confusion about the exchange tokens) and plays quickly (like 10 minutes with 2) and those factors are always important for filler games. But obviously the most important factor is whether it’s fun and/or has strategy (and not just pure luck), and I think this game does have some strategy.

On the other hand, it also has a lot of “luck of the draw” – some of the special cards are simply much better than others, and if you’re not drawing the cards you need for your train, you’re going to have a bad time. Sure, you can always reserve some cards, and that makes up for it somewhat, and after all this is not a hugely strategic eurogame, but a short filler which is somewhat enjoyable. I would play it again and would also like to try it with four players just to see how different it is.

RATING: 6
*6* (Initial Plays)
Light card game that fits for a filler or family game. I thought is to be a standard card game with luck in the card draw. I still thought it to be entertaining because of the train card theme and the quickness of play.

Aramini Circus est encore un jeu de la gamme des jeux rikiki pas cher de Iello. La blague du jour : Qu'est-ce qui est plus lourd qu'un éléphant dans un train ? Ben ... 2 éléphants dans un train (ne vous sentez pas obligé de rigoler tellement c'est nul ...). Remplissez votre train avec des paires d'animaux de cirque. Celui qui aura le plus beau train (parce que les illustrations des cartes sont quand même bien chouette) gagnera.  Un bon petit jeu familial de gestion de main.

Pour 2 à 4 joueurs, pour des parties de 20 minutes environ

We played with the caboose and bonus cards expansions which I take to be required for any play. I can't imagine this would be very interesting without those dimensions (and which may explain my geekbud hate for this game). As it is with them, I found it to be reasonably good filler.

Caboose = You have to end your train with this color-2 card so even if you have 18 points, making it match means other players may have time to catch up

Bonus cards = There are plenty of bonus actions to give you extra options and big turn capabilities

Initial Rating: 4.5 (June 2016)

Yardmaster is a very simple game in the vein of Ticket to Ride. I didn´t like it.

The aesthetics of the game is very cool. The rules are very easy, you can explain them under 5 minutes. The playtime is around 30 minutes.

The decisions are very obvious and the gameplay is dull and repetitive. There is almost no skill involved and the luck factor is through the roof. I feel the free action cards are overpowered and unbalanced.

Bottom line, Yardmaster can be a good family game but I really disliked it. It is way too light for me, it has lots of uncontrollable luck and the decisions needed to play it are very obvious.

Yardmaster is an excellent mix of beautiful art and wonderfully simplistic gameplay.  With each action, you feel like you needed just one more action and, in those special circumstances where you get that one more action...guess what!  You needed ONE MORE ACTION!  But I really love that.  Good game with great components (Kickstarter version).

RATING: 3
In this game you use cargo cards to purchase rail cards from a display. You add the rail cards to your train if it matches the number or color of the card previous to it. If it does not, then you just hold it and add it when you can. You can also trade cards 2:1 if you have the right counter to do so. You can get the right counter simply by spending an action to take it from another player. If you are the first to add railcars of a value that hits the target for the game, you win!

The game is dull, dull, dull. There is little skill involved. You decide what card you are going for based on what it appears likely that you could achieve. Then you cross your fingers and go for it. Nothing innovative or even interesting here. In some ways it is too easy to do what you want and when it is hard (ie. the cards you draw don't match what you need), there's not a lot you can do about it without the right action card. The action cards add a bunch of uninteresting additional stuff to do (extra action, pick a card from the discard, sweep the display, and so on...). *yawn*

A good filler game that doesn't overstay it's welcome. Easy to teach, and easy to get into. You know what's going on in just a turn or two. The way that resources map 1:1 into victory points when buying railcars artificially makes the point spread at the end of the game tight every game. So playing optimally every turn is the key in this game, but there are so few decisions to make each turn (not in a bad way, the game is supposed to play through really quick) that you don't get AP. Although it's not horrible with just 2, it really plays best with more players.

Very cool little set collection card game.  Some light strategy but still friendly to new players.  Excellent art and very nice component quality.  Turns generally move fairly quickly, although I wish the game finished consistently at around 30 minutes (usually about 45 or so).

Joué une fois a 2 chez Fred. 
Selon les recommandations, devrait mieux se jouer à 3, mais roule très bien à 2 grâce à un jeton qui permets de faire une cation supplémentaire. Fort sympathique comme petit jeu de carte mais rien d'innovant. On doit construire un train pour avoir un total de 18 points. Les wagons sont de différentes couleurs et avec des nombres de 1 à 3 (pts). 2 actions a réaliser parmi un choix de 3 (piger des cartes soit cachées ou dans la défausse, jouer des cartes pour recuperer des locomotives, ou échanger un jeton de trade 2:1) il est possible de mettre de côté certaines locomotives, en effet elles doivent se suivre, soit en ayant la même couleur, soit le même chiffre.

[b]Yardmaster[/b] was received in a math trade (1/5/15).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Yardmaster is a game I regularly play with my wife (it's a great pub/cafe game) and older daughter. It has also become one of my favorite fillers (probably my favorite for 2p). My wife really appreciates the simplicity of the rules and turn structure, but there is still enough depth to keep us coming back. We have a KS copy, so we play with all the bonus cards which also helps keep the game fresh. Yardmaster is basically a race and being able to create combos using bonus cards can be the difference between winning and losing. On top of that it has some of my favorite board game art; it reminds me of the children's book Freight Train (which won the Caldecott award). 

Obviously I highly recommend Yardmaster, but make sure you give it a few plays. It is definitely a game I've come to appreciate more after playing multiple times with the same people.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Perfect cafe game, small footprint and plays fast.
- This is a great gateway/ family game.
- Easy rule set to learn/teach.
- Plays well with 2.[/i]

Aaahh! Sorry David, this one is slightly better! I do prefer playing Yardmaster over Yardmaster Express. This one is slightly more involved, there are more options available each turn and it does feel tighter than Express. With Express you play each turn, with Yardmaster, you can hold back and it also enables you to do more combo-type moves. Nice, short, tense.

A very enjoyable game.

Had some interesting decisions, but only having 2 actions per turn really limited your options. I liked the theme, the cards looked great and the gameplay felt smooth. It just wasn't as interesting as I was hoping for. Luck also felt rather prevalent, but that may have just been because it was our first game. I'd play it again, but by no means am I going to rush out and snag a copy.

I like this little game.   Picked up the IOS version and played on a recent flight for a business trip.  When I returned I immediately purchased a physical copy.

It a a fine little filler.  Wish there could be more strategy as it seems to be very luck based.  Need to be able to sweep the board.  I guess that card is in the expansion which is unavailable

This game has really striking looking cards, and a beautiful box. The general idea is you collect sets of cards from the deck, and then exchange them for other sets of cards from a central card purchase area. The group I played this with were bored by it, even in the 20 min or so it took to play. They felt that it was more of an activity than a game. I'm not sure how I feel. I really love love the look of it... I found it sort of enjoyable. Am i being dazzled by beauty here?

Doesn't feel too much different than playing rummy with a few extra wrinkles, but those wrinkles add some nice decision making to the game. Having to decide when to exchange 2:1 tokens and when to use the yardmaster token is nice.

One negative is sometimes you might not have any railcars you can use and you just have to complete them anyway and hope the next revealed car can be linked with your current and eventually the one you completed, otherwise you wasted some precious turns and actions. But for the most part you can avoid that if you pick the most flexible option in the lineup to build.

[Crash Games Kickstarter 2014 edition] {Train; set-collection, card-drafting, action-point; optimal 3p} Yardmaster is a solid filler.  Players collects cargo to build railcads to get points.  It reminds me of card games in the 90s.  It is a casual game. There is not much long time planning.  Players just need to make best use of cards that show up.  The bonus cards add some dynamic during the play.

It is easy to explain and understand the rules.  It is very easy to set up too. Good.

The illustration is vintage.  The icons are effective.  Easy to understand.

Get it if you like trains and light-weight card games.

Nice relaxing game that sort of reminds me a little of Ticket to Ride.  Not to say there isn't tension - there is - but it's not a brain burner.  I consider it far superior to some other games of this type such as Jaipur.  Two plays so far, one 2p and and 3p, and so far this looks like a keeper.  One of the rare KS games that hasn't disappointed.

UPDATE: Have played 4 or 5 times now.  Card quality is unfortunately very low.  Cards are already showing quite a bit of wear.  Seems odd that the box the cards came in was built like a tank - one of the sturdiest boxes I've ever seen for a game like this! - while the cards are so flimsy.  Shame on the publisher.  Would have been better to have had a cheaper box and gone with better cards.

I'm betting that the 2:1 trading disks were a desperate fix to cull some of the toe-tapping boredom.  Though they're only partly successful, since - even with the disks - players can be stuck for multiple turns without much to do while waiting to draw the right cards.

Also, there's little incentive to purchase trains that aren't immediately useful, since all it does is open up a new train that might be critically useful for someone else.

Finally, I won because I got lucky with bonus cards. Yay.

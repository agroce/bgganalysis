A beautiful map on quality paper, great looking counters and a detailed game. Moreover it is not very expensive in comparison with other lesser quality games.
There is also a unique historical comment.

The smallest of the BAR series thus far, and every bit as pretty as the others. A good intro to the series, as it's both manageable and the situation and terrain help you to make decisions as to what to do next.

That's also a slight weakness: there's a low level of variety here. There are just two scenarios; the main one kicks off the battle at 8am, when the Prussians have debouched from the valley and are engaged on the Lobosch, the other at 6am, extending the game and giving greater scope for pre-engagement manoeuvre. I think most games will follow a similar pattern, but there is one element that will increase the level of uncertainty and variety. The Austrians start with the bulk of their force off map, and can choose how much to commit to battle. Naturally, the more they commit, the better they must perform to win, but it also means that the Prussian player can never be entirely certain of what will appear, and where and when it might arrive.

Quite a fine game (and a very good series), though I find it difficult to win playing the Austrians. Maybe this could be changed by tweaking the victory conditions; there are some suggestions for this on the BAR-thread at consimworld. Never tried them, though. But the game is still fun to play and excellent for solitaire gaming, too!

I am a great fan of Clash of Arms' BAR series and it is the inspiration for my Geekname (Der Alte Fritz or "Old Fritz" being the affectionate nickname given by the Prussians to their king, Frederick the Great).
This game is one of my favourites as it is of a "manageable" size some of the others being too  much of a good thing considering the richness and complexity of the system.  It's a meeting engagement as both sides advance from opposite ends of a valley. The Prussians are short on infantry but have some great cavalry, including the renowned Ansbach-Bayreuth Dragoons. One division of their infantry is commanded by emigre Scotsman James Keith (sadly killed 2 years later at Hochkirch). The quality of the Prussian units is somewhat greater than that of the Austrians so it is hard for the Austrians to win unless Frederick the Great goes AWOL at the crisis point of the battle to compose a quick flute concerto! (Yes, he used to do this in his spare time in between writing letters to Voltaire).

Paul Dangel developed some good game before, but his track record of being a designer is another thing.  I hope this one would be cooked right. AH's strategic level Frederick game is my favourite.  This is the first battle of the Seven Years War.  The map looks good and scaled to the real thing. Just simply take a comparison between both maps posted up here.

1756, the first battle of the Seven Yearsâ€™ War. The Prussians advance in heavy fog (modelled in the game) on what they believe is an Austrian rear guard, unaware for several hours that they are attacking an entire Austrian army in a defensible position. 
A smaller battle by BAR standards, but still involving, and great fun for those interested in modelling 18th Century battles at this level of detail. After Kolin, this is my favourite situation of the series. The 2nd Edition rulebook is included but files are available on the BAR support site for updating it to 3rd Edition (provided you have a copy of the rules themselves, which are currently only available with the Fontenoy game). Components, as usual for a BAR game, are a treat for the eyes, map is stunning, etc. One issue however is that the die-cutting of the counters, at least in my copy, was fairly crude which forced me to trim and clip more than I am used to.

1 map, few counters, only 2 scenarios though both are variations of the full battle (33 and 39 game turns). Looks great, though. Beautiful map & counters and a great commentary. Just not much fun, unless you define fun as slogging your way through hills, woods, towns and marshes. Not really for the beginner because of scenario length and loads of special rules and tricky terrain. 

Update: expansion set included in Prague adds space, counters, and scenarios. Great addition.

Very handsome game, and great to have a full-fledged battle that's still a one mapper for this, the fifth entry in the most excellent Battles from the Age of Reason series. But I'm going to go against the prevailing wisdom here and suggest that Lobositz actually makes for a less-than optimal introduction to the series.

Both sides are fielding full European armies, with all three combat arms represented. The tactical situation is very open ended; the Prussians have to stabilize their left flank and attack, but there's enough wide open space on the map that the battle can develop along any number of different vectors. The beginner is forced to come to grips with skirmishers and loads of cavalry almost immediately, which makes for a varied learning exercise but is also daunting. Finally, the Austrian has strategic options in terms of how much of his off-map force to enter, which impacts victory conditions. In short, the battle itself is something more than a beginner's situation; a new player simply won't have the confidence and experience to grasp what they should be doing with their army on either side. I'd recommend one of the infantry-only scenarios from Zorndorf to start, or maybe one of the short Brandywine scenarios, despite the plethora of special rules.

Beautiful game, takes a bit to play though.  The smaller scenario was fairly good.  I like this series in general.  The rule set is mature.

Takes a looong time to play, 8-16 hours.  Lots of work involved.  But, fun to play if you have the time.  Likely to have units move around in a plausible fashion.

Good "small" game for someone wanting an introduction to the Battles from the Age of Reason series.  Prussian quality generally wins out over the Austrian numbers, but I still enjoy exploring options for both sides.  The counter graphics for this game are of a higher standard than those of the other Seven Years' War games in this series.

Update, 5/29/2014: Prague, Volume VIII in the BAR series, includes a half-map extension for this game (adding area to the southern edge), revised game-specific rules, and counters to correct errata and bring elements of the game up to the 3rd edition rule standard. The map extension eliminates the need for an off-map display for the Austrian forces, and the rules change the victory conditions.

I don't have the game yet (it should be here in a couple days), so no rating, but I'm looking forward to it. It'll be interesting to see how this game compares to the game I was designing back in the mid-80s. My game was the same scale as the C-o-A version and I was basing the mechanics on the La Battaile series. My project ran out of steam due to a lack of research resources. I also have "Kolin" from the same series, but I've never played it. The smaller size of Lobositz makes it more likely to see some time on the game table.

Fantastic production value, you get a lot for your money. Gamewise no comment yet.

Update: Setup the game, played a few evenings of BAR before that, read the Primer and now into Lobositz. Great, great game and system. Highly recommended.

much fun, much chaos on the battlefield, quite unpredictable, you feel like in the middle of the battle with bullets flying around you... Lobositz gives a much better feel of the "linear system" than prussia's glory for instance ... Lobositz is fascinating and stays in your mind for many days after the playing session. This is very very good. On the downside, it takes much much time to play (currently we played about 25 hours and have finished 5 turns; but we are newbies, who have to check the rules very often), and i am not quite sure whether the better player wins because of the quite chaotic results of die rolls ... Lobositz is a great simulation ... whether it is a great game, i am actually not quite sure ... I also wish the rules would be more precise in some points ... Anyway, for anybody interested in tactical questions of 7YW battles, i guess this is a must.

+ The game is about a topic not treated to death.
+ It really gives you a sense of historicity, the action on the board seems so authentic, as does the decision making of a player as field commander. I think it does it's job as a tactical simulation better than Squad Leader for example.
+ It's fun in an Ameritrash way, because some dice rolls may go awfully wrong and can really screw you or your intentions up. This also augments the former since it creates chaos and confusion on the battle field/board. Luck is not game deciding either, your strategy just shouldn't rely on everything going down smoothly.

- It takes a lot of commitment in time and the rules aren't simple either.

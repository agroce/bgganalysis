Encompasses the whole Asian theater of operation (rather than the Pacific) in an interesting perspective. Accurately reflects the two possible American invasions paths to Japan. Naval battle are completely abstracted. Rules are long and cumbersome.
The game requires a good knowledge of the cards - as misuse can have serious consequences. All in all, an ok game not very exciting.

Drool....

11/2011 - If ever a war game screamed to be played after opening the box, its this one. Can't wait. Beautiful map and counters; play aids could be spruced up though.

Edit: 12/2011 - Lots of moving parts/chrome. I am fortunate that I cut my teeth on the old TK! first. Big learning curve in rules and strategy/tactics. A thoroughly fun war gaming experience though. Playing this while reading "Shattered Sword" has been an enlightening experience. My first impulse is to compare it to Empire of the Sun, because for me, that is the standard by which all other PTO Grand Strategy should be judged. DS! stands up quite admirably next to EotS and complements it rather than competes with it. 

First, it takes stock of the full array of political/military choices confronting the fragmented Japanese. The CBI, is in no way abstracted politically, militarily or map-wise. 

Second, whereas most if not all PTO games use air/naval as the core dynamic, DS is basically a "panzer pusher" as someone said, with air/naval details abstracted to strategic "support units"; the abstraction does not weaken their effectiveness though, as these units (as in TK!) are the keys (and gas) to your military engine. Both of these twists give a really refreshing take on the strategic view of the PTO. 

Why didn't anyone think of applying a panzer pusher dynamic to the entire PTO before? A truly brilliant design stroke! It automatically freed up the design from the trap that other PTO strategy titles get entangled: operational details of forces (air forces and navies) that were not the ends, but the means to them. For those who want to drill down further into the operational level, while maintaining a strategic narrative, perhaps Pacific War Redux (Please hurry Mark H. and MMP!) will scratch that itch.

More than half way through the '37 scenario playing the non-Axis side my reaction is that this is a fascinating game of geo politics and military strategy. The Axis has all the fun at first, with little for the Wallies and Soviets to do (even less so than in TK). In fact, if the Soviets are "pacted" early, than there is near zero for them to do until later in the war. Granted the '37 start time has  lot to do with the Allies standing around staring at their shoes. Things are heating up now that Total War is in effect and the US has entered the fray. Also, the direction of the game is guided by uncertain results from the war in Europe. 

I can't contemplate playing the full Axis Empires campaign (TK+DS) right now, but hope to at MonsterCon some day, as a buddy suggested :)

I would like to give this a 9-9.5, but dinged it down to 8.5 because of the amount of errata present given a new release.

Here's the thing that really bugs me about Dai Senso, that's giving me a hard time in coming to grips with it: Say you're the US in '42, and you want to do an invasion/counter-invasion on Guadalcanal. There are only a couple unit types that create Beachheads - Air and Surface Fleets. If the Japanese have the forces to counter your placements, you simply cannot go there. It's not like if you play a Surface unit, a Carrier, and an Air Force, and then Japanese counter with the same units, that makes your landing risky. It means you cannot attempt it. All the risk in the game is encapsulated in ground combat, and then how much damage you take *after* the naval battle. There is no risk at all in winning or losing air and naval battles, it's all deterministic. If you have the support assets, it's not a question of whether you can, just how much damage you will take in the process - a battle like Midway *cannot* occur in the game as it did historically (in the game, the Japanese would have had the support unit edge and an extra surface fleet, so they land automatically and the battle is decided by ground combat). This is, to my mind, a serious problem. The land-game focus is an admirable thing to have tried, but at the end of the day, risky carrier battles and amphibious assaults were a major part of the war in the PTO, while huge ground operations - while critical to the causes of the war and the only thing going on in the 1937-1941 timeframe - were only part of the narrative after '41.

Having said all this, one does have to give Dai Senso credit for illuminating aspects of the war that were important and other games don't even attempt. The PTO in WWII is a notoriously hard gaming problem, done badly many times, and the only really good entry I've played is Asia Engulfed - but even that misses a lot of stuff. Perhaps the trade-offs Dai Senso! makes are no worse than anyone else's given the difficulty of the situation. Still, as an Anglo-American, WWII in the Pacific without carrier battles is hard to stomach.

PDF rules are now available online, thankfully!

Had some success with the first couple learning scenarios, although honestly they're pretty vacuous and provide almost zero interest other than providing a chunk-wise way to learn the game. I think I may have made a mistake starting with Dai Senso instead of Totaler Krieg (having played none of the current or previous games in the family). It's an intriguing and gutsy game simply because it's a Pacific game that provides almost no thematic attention to air and naval battles, which one would think is a tough way to go. On the other hand, China - frequently given short shrift despite its centrality to the causes of the war - is given fair play, the alt-hist exploration of various "entrance paths" into war is really interesting, and the card based strategic paths seem great. It tries to stay true to it's massive scale (Armies, Fronts, Fleets) but needless tactical details do intrude from time to time. While I am drawn to the system I'll probably try to play TK! before DS!, just because it feels like TK! is the game, and DS! Is the PTO adjunct. That may be unfair, as some knowledgeable folks seem to be fans of DS! and one can't deny the historical detail of the strategic cards, but that's still how the game systems feel to me FWIW (I still have limited exposure obviously). Also, DS! lacks compelling one-map scenarios; just the one for the war in China which, while not frequently gamed, did not always feature a ton of action. One thing war games need to try to do better is telescoping time; the China war should be fought on a different timescale than the war with the US.

It must be said that while the game systems actually seem pretty clean (except for the usual million special cases for politics), the rules almost seem designed to be incredibly daunting due to a completely opaque presentation order, uneven depth of explanation, and excessive reliance on technical terms. To play the first scenario you don't need to know anything before page 17, for example, and if you were to read all that stuff most of the rules would be unclear because they rely on sections later in the rulebook; the core concepts of ZOCs and stacking are not introduced until page 35, whilch seems crazy. I am a long-time war gamer and I admit I found them incomprehensible and could only learn by chipping away through the uninteresting toy scenarios. Oh, and no index, of course. More damning still, no electronic rules, so you can't put them on your iPad and search them, nor can you easily give copied to friends who might be intereted in playing. Anyway, given that the raw complexity here is high, I'm not sure there is an easy answer, but there could and should have been a better way to present these rules.

Struggling through the learning scenarios on this one. Surprisingly difficult rulebook, given the system has been around what, 10+ years? It's surprisingly unclear, for example, how many times HQs can provide support per turn because of a poorly-definied "participated in" modifier. These is core stuff that should have been much more crisply and precisely explained. Also errors in the setup of the very first learning scenario. The Soviet invasion scenario is also odd because the Soviet tank in w5524 can just disengage, drive next to the objective, and attack at 9-1 for an auto-win (with air and HQ support), which seems odd.

Anyway, this is an interesting game which seems like it's up my alley. It'll just depend on whether the complexity of the rules defeats me or not before I get there.

I Played the China scenario.  It was fast. Without the named ships.  I think the game, with the patch to stop the easy Axis win is good.   The expansion pack will make this better.  $80

The rulebook can make the game appear more complex than it is.  The actual gameplay is very straightforward and I find the rulebook to be very clear and without ambiguities.  Quite an achievement for all that this game does.

The game allows you to play from 1937 to the end of World War 2.  The game does an excellent job of allowing you freedom of strategy while keeping you within the constraints of the politics of the time.  There is enough variability to provide a large amount of replayability.

Axis Empires Totaler Krieg is the best world war 2 grand strategy game I have played and one of my top 5 games period.  It's sister Dai Senso is absolutely fantastic as well.

This hits the sweet spot for grand strategy detail for me.

I strongly recommended this to anyone who likes grand strategy.  If you play the grand campaign, be prepared for a glorious 50 hours of gaming.

The best strategic simulation if you are looking for a recreation af the starting situation of WWII and then playing a credible alternate history.  Less interesting for who are seeking for a historical simulation that permit you to take some different decision. The Sino-Japanase war is very well simulated (events and feelings) while the Pacific War is too abstract and the carriers battle  loose appeal and feeling suffer of this. Anyway alternate history is definitely his ground and here there is no better game.

Beautiful Map!  Very nice rule book!  Playing it this weekend with Lawrence Hung!

Dai Senso! Axis Empires, after a haphazard rule learning multiplayer partial game, I went at the game solo. What I can say is it plays magnificently soliatire. There is so much going on that there is no way you can predict any side's turn.

The game is remarkably flexible with history and at the same time has great historical flair about it. The cards' actions and the card titles don't always make total historical sense, but its well playtested and I think Decision games have a winner here!

Unfortunately this system does not work for me. It is too fiddly and cumbersome with lot of exceptions. I also don't like few concepts and handling of naval and air.

RATING: 4
an after-thought add-on to TK. the naval systems are so abstract, and rules impossible to understand.

since for all practical purposes you cannot move units from europe to asia i do not understand why the designers kept a marginal-abstract system of air and naval power from the land-centric war in europe to the air-war in the pacific. 

there is no index to the rules, no cross referencing and so much confusion from my perspective that it is unplayable. IF you are able to sit and absorb with 100% reading comprehension the 64 pages of rules before you start you can play this. otherwise, you will never get the first unit moved out of japan, because the whole convoy and invasion system are terribly confusing

Totaler Krieg in Asia!  

Movement is called "Operational Movement Phase" in the game, nothing really special but just a different name which sounds better. Moving into EZOC stops the units but otherwise it doesn't cost MPs to exit and re-enter another EZOC. Moving on road or rail is based on whether the size of the unit - single or multiple steps unit. Weather effects can affect a unit's ability to move out or into an EZOC.  Overruns can occur during movement - a multiple step unit can just move into, ignoring EZOC the unit it will overrun, a hex containing a single step one and eliminates it if the hex is a clear terrain.  Other unit's EZOC cannot be ignored though.  So watch out those lone units often.  There are quite some rules on beachhead movement, port-to-port movement and off-map box-to-box movement procedures but basically the unit uses its entire MPs to move into a beachead marker or an off-map box.  Unit can travel across different naval zones to another port though.

EZOC rules are simple basically. Units have to stop in EZOC upon moving into it unless the enemy is being overrun.  Friendly units negate EZOC and it is important to remember! That means the unit can continue exploitation into EZOC. Supply line and retreat cannot come across EZOC.  In snow, storm and mud, units cannot move out of EZOC. During reserve movement, no unit can move into or out of EZOC.  

Stacking is generally 3 units per hex with no more than 6 steps.  Supply line can be traced through the first two hexes of any kind of terrain for free to a road or railroad back to a supply source.

There is a Blitz Combat Segment and a Regular Combat Segment. Blitz Combat refers to the special types of combat e.g. airdrop, airlanding, beachhead landing and the most important blitz combat of the "blitz-enabled" units.  The Russian can attack in snow in this combat while others cannot.  Think of the winter uniform for the Russians in a general counterattack!  One thing hard to remember is that you would return the CV Strike units back to Naval Zone's Used Box in this segment.    

Regular combat cannot be done for odds less than 1-3.  HQ can provide attack or defense support within two hexes.  Don't forget HQ also contribute a CRT shift in combat too.  HQ is therefore a thing being encouraged in the game.  Marine units can attack beachhead.  

The "Initial Administrative Phase" is a unique feature in Totaler Krieg/ Dai Senso and this is what distinguishes the gaming system from others.  This phase contains the highly acclaimed Political Events Segment, which integrates the political system with the military system in the game.  The Support Segment manages the Beachhead, Convoy, Blitz markers.  Support units or markers with a Delay Stripe returns to base in the "Delay Box". Lastly, two units of the same no. of steps can be combined into a two step units during the Organization Segment.       

People thought that the game lacked the maneuver part but I am fine with it because I don't think China is a theatre for a mobile war. The terrain to the west is always hill or rough. The only natural choice for the Japanese was to go south attacking Shanghai.

I love the DS game design in which it integrates the political module with the military module very elegantly (as many of you who are familiar with Totaler Krieg! may know). The "Initial Administrative Phase" adds a bit of load to the gameplay but I think the phase is absolutely essential. 

People definitely like the game with so few counters on the map (at least in the beginning) while so many things can happen. The Western player looks a bit boring in the beginning if the rolling dices lead to no result on the Options Card.

Overall, this game is fun and realistic on the strategic level for WWII Asian theatre. China is the focus in the game, the only game that I can think of so far that deals with the Japanese invasion of China directly at this level (whereas Empire of the Sun left out China entirely). There is a lot of depth to the game for many years of enjoyment, with different development of stories every time (for example, in one game Hopeh country may resist the Japanese invasion while in another game it may be ceded to Japan early in the game!). Players' strategy on the board would be obviously affected by it, reacting to different circumstances.  If stepping into the hot kitchen of the strategic command center is what you want, DS is by far the most chellenging and playable game.

The map is colorful enough with the money I spent on the game.  But DG counters remain something to desire with regards to their thickness. The game is perfect for solitaire study and PBEM too. I am going to study it more.

Brilliant re-focusing of emphasis on the Pacific War with naval and air actions taking their place in the greater scheme of claiming and reclaiming territory. Rather than the Pacific War acting as a backdrop for carrier battles, Dai Senso! demonstrates how they were the means to an end: the wielding of power over the whole region.

Wonderful grand strategy WWII game. This is the Pacific game that links to Axis Empires: Totaler Krieg! for all of WWII. The Card system is great, the break down and build up and an extra layer to decisions you need to make, and the random events means you never play the same game twice. Changed my rating to a 10 to off set the "1" trolls and because Axis Empires: Totaler Krieg is #3 on my Top 10 in my BGG Profile (they should be together)

Crayon rails games are fun, though a bit long.  This one is good but I think I prefer these when the map is more familiar.  Would like to replace with Empire Builder or Eurorails.

A fun variant - reminds me of Iron Dragon actually, big, lots of expensive terrain, epic. Fortunately it doesn't take as long as Iron Dragon did, the payouts seem a little better, and it works better with smaller numbers of players. We always play crayon-rails with 2 players, 2 trains/4 delivery cards each, all trains +2MP, which I think is the ideal way to play and the only way I play anymore - all the crayon rails games are absolutely brutal at 5/6 players. Iron Dragon was pretty thin with 2 players, but Martian Rails seems fine. 

The theming is clever and fun, and although kinda silly, more effective than Lunar Rails I think. Lots of references to lots of sci-fi standards. My only regret is that Babylon 5 didn't make more of an appearance, given how important Mars was to that series.

The whole series of Empire Builder train games is my favourite game set I have yet encountered.  Martian Rails is brilliant for the features that make the map unique - wrapped-world, references to great works of Science Fiction - but learning the geography can be complicated.  For that reason I am less likely to play this one than others in the family (Empire Builder, Euro Rail, etc) with new people.

With my group, it is generally over 2.5 hours to play this; usually less than 4 hours total.

Plays well with 3, wonder whether it would scale well in terms of time commitment with more. This is the first crayon rails game i've played, and it is fun.

UPDATE: We still love all the Crayon Rails games but we find we prefer the ones where we spend less time searching for cities on the map so Iâ€™d probably play Empire Builder, British Rails, or Eurorails over this one. If one had to go, it would probably be this one.

Well, we are big crayon rails fan so this is another great entry in the line. Fun for the theme, but hard to get used to because you have to keep figuring out where everything is. I like the map they were able to build because they didn't have to have any sort of geographical accuracy.

Love the mix of Sci-Fi history and science fact in this. Once you get used to the 3D wrap-around and learn the geography, it becomes one of the faster playing rail games. Plus it has some tight spots for just two players, but not overwhelming if more play.

Again see Empire Builder. More balanced and the event cards actually do good things! Martian landscape can be difficult - it hurts my brain too much to think about optimizing routes because of the inside-nature of the board. I would rather play one of the more traditional maps.

Yet another variation on the Empire Builder series that takes place on another planet, with yet another interesting twist: where Lunar Rails represented the moon in two circular halves, Martian Rails represents Mars in six triangular panels, similar to a 3-segment map. The panel edges connect to other panel edges, and the map wraps around. Like Iron Dragon and Lunar Rails, new players will spend most of their time trying to locate fantasy locations on Mars. Veteran players will surely appreciate the challenges in finding new routes, and new strategies to find the shortest paths around Mars. Like everything in the Empire Builder series, it is all a matter of personal taste.

Good stuff.  I am a big fan of the crayon rails I've played, and this may be the most interesting one I've tried (between it, India Rails, and Eurorails--all of which I really enjoy).  I love the references, the event cards are much more interesting than the ones in Eurorails, and the geography is... perplexing!  The wraparound board, the obstacles all over the place and the feeling that there are some places you just can't or don't want to go really help to create the greater sense of scope you should have when dealing with an entire planet instead of just a continent or subcontinent.  The other crayon rails still have their place--for one thing, they are much shorter!--but I'm a fan.  (1 play)

I do like the concept of drawing on the map and erasing it after but the crayons sometimes don't very well and gets rubbed off a lot.  Also the games ending condition drags the game on for too long.  Seems like it needs some work on the rules since we almost got stuck and cant do anything for the entire game.  Maybe I misread a rule and am playing wrong.  I will probably give it a second try.

HOW TO USE THE WRAP LETTERS

The rules are poor on this subject, the examples given contradict the rules, and the examples contradicts each other. The discussions here are convoluted. I don't know about any of this complicated stuff...

[b]We play...[/b] each wrap point connects to the obvious horizontal mile marker it connects to, plus it also connects to the one obvious diagonal mile marker that it appears to connect to.

In this way, D wrap points work in exactly the same way as all of the other wrap points. All wrap points connect to exactly 2 mile markers on the other side - the 2 obvious mile markers! I think this is the intent of the rules. I can't be certain. This approach is the simplest way to interpret the overly complicated wrapping rules.

This is a good one.  The rules are well balanced and the distribution of loads, cities, and terrain seems to work really well.  The wrapping map is a cool feature of the Lunar and Martian maps.  The rule book is laid out really well.  This is one of my favorites of the series.

At its core, this is simply an Empire Builder (crayon rail) variant.  What really differentiates this game from other crayon rails is the event cards: they're both interesting and varied, they're not all bad, and some of them stick around until satisfied, or even indefinitely.  That said, the terrain is not as interesting as Eurorails (I miss water), and mercador-projection wrapping is a little unintuitive.  And while I do appreciate the plethora of geeky jokes found in the city and goods names, I do miss having actual geography and whatnot.

Martian Rails is all about route building and delivering stuff. Unlike Steam (or Age of Steam), the stuff that is something specific. It's so much more fun to deliver ray guns and solar CDs than it is to deliver red cubes and yellow cubes. In fact, it's more fun to deliver boring stuff like iron than abstract "red stuff." 

There's a free form nature to the crayon rails leading to a totally different set up every time. You build one section of track because you need to connect two cities, and the track grows organically because each demand draw presents new challenges. It's my preference for cards again. 

Plus who doesn't love sitting down with some crayons and doodling. It appeals to my inner child while simultaneously simulating a mathy, thinky aspect of my personality. It's weird and absolutely awesome. As if that weren't enough, at the end of the game I've got that Agricola sense of satisfaction (the feeling when you look at your farm at the end of the game and think "I built that!").

But the most shining endorsement that I can give it is that it was simple enough to teach to my dad, and yet it was still quite interesting for me. He even did better than my brother. We helped him out a bit, but he seemed to enjoy it. Not as much as he likes Wings of War, but enough that I'd ask him to play again.

Very nice addition to the Empire Builder line of crayon rail games. The "spherical" map makes for interesting route planning, and is easier to comprehend than the Lunar Rails spherical map.

And this, if anything, is less appealing (well, modulo, the "can you identify the historic inspiration of [i]this city/resource's[/i] name?" game.)

I do enjoy the pickup and deliver mechanic as well as the route building with the crayons with this one. However, it does seem much like a glorified version of Rail Baron without the luck of rolling dice to move. However, your orders do have a fair amount of luck to them, and since that drives the game, I can't say that I'd like to play this all the time, but I wouldn't mind it from time to time. I do like the Martian theme here to make it a little more exotic, which moves this up to a 6.2.

1 play, 4er, without events (as usual for us).

RATING: 8
My first impression of Martian Rails was of too-cutesy map features, cities, events, and commodities, with a jumble of ER Burroughs' mars, random SF references, bad SF in-jokes, incoherent weirdness, and trite crayon rail tropes. My second impression was the features on the map were over-gamy, contrived and manipulative of the players. However, after a couple plays, I see that Martian Rails provides a unique play experience among the Empire Builder games, requiring unique tactics. While the usual Empire Builder game has realistic terrain which sometimes does not supply as interesting a game board as might be wished, Martian Rails provides a more intricate play experience than other EB games. I think MR will stand repeated plays, unlike Iron Dragon, which is just a little too much trouble to play.

RATING: 6.6
My favorite of the series so far.  The geometry of the MR map offers more interesting opportunities for spatial tactics, esp. with 3 players.  My problem with the game, as with the other crayons I've played, is its excessive length.

RATING: 7
Compared to Empire Builder, Martian Rails is a mixed bag.  Yes, the locomotives move faster, the terrain is more vivid and varied, and the theme is utterly charming.  Classic sci-fi fans will be delighted!  But all of this is counterbalanced by city names that are alien, scattered randomly, and not referenced by grid position on the contracts.  (Duh!)  The result would be a home run but so much time is wasted sorting through the darn map.

My first crayon rails game. The map is a bit difficult to wrap (ha!) your head around at first, at least compared to the more familiar maps, but it makes the game pretty interesting as well. After half a game, the cities started to become easier to find and memorize. The train cards look delightful, the events seem interesting, and the resources are a bit livelier due to the references in them (soylent red? bachelor chow? the 3-eyed Simpsons fish? I love it!). 

The system is simpler than I thought it would initially be, but there seems to be quite a bit of depth hidden in there. It's easy to see why this type of train game has lasted for a few decades; it's easy to learn, easy to teach, and there are many decisions to be made. I've found I enjoy simpler systems with great depth that play a bit longer than others, and this is a nice example.  

The lengthy downtime comments seem to be accurate, not that I find it to be a major problem or anything. Repeated plays will surely help with this. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fundamentally unchanged from the rest of the [gameid=168] series, which is mostly disappointing.  I really want the series to make something new, as the core here is so strong and so cool.  It really needs some modernizing, as the mistakes that Empire Builder made are repeated again and again and again.  It's simply  inexcusable that there is such a prodigious amount of downtime after a player delivers a load and receives a new card to consider.  In addition, the action tends to happen in fits and starts, depending on the building and deliveries that are happening.

This Martian edition is neat on its surface, with lots of little nods to science fiction lore (Roddenberries, hee!).  The more granular upgrades to trains are definitely a positive.  But at its core, this game is unchanged from its parent, and will hang around morosely with its parent in the morass of "Same game, different map" variations that have dogged this series.

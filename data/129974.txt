RATING: N/A
More great minis and a decent game system.

RATING: 7.5
One of the better starter sets with enough different miniatures. Thou they are single pose, there is enough variety of minis to make them standout.

RATING: 7
Probably one of the best values in starter sets in recent years with a good selection of Chaos and Loyalist marines, with fairly good sculpts.  For example the dreadnaught that comes in this version is quite a bit more detailed than that which came with the last edition.  Still it's Warhammer 40k.  The rules are still wonky, armies are still broken, but we'll keep playing because we love moving little bits of plastic about and trash talking our friends.

The game is, in a vaccuum, pretty enjoyable, but warhammer 40K as a whole quickly becomes a black hole into which money is poured. The constantly evolving game rules combined with the need to prepare and paint minis makes this an either-or proposition: You can play warhammer or you can play a huge variety of other board games with the money you'd spend keeping up on warhammer.

I got this to try Warhammer, even just a playful skirmish in the basement; and half to paint some minis, a hobby I would like to START. 
sadly, I have not painted a mini since 1998. 
someday this will get assembled... I swear!

Okay starer set for 40k, Dark Angels vs Chaos. Good spread of units to get you familiarized with the game and good value.

Models are great for being snap-together.

Pretty simple way to introduce the game to new players but the armies are slightly imbalanced as the dark angels player tends to have the advantage.

Bought this as an attempt to get back into 40k.
Played a few kill teams games with the minis.  Essentially same balance issues exist in 40k 6th ed - now worse in 7th.

A great set. Playable by itself as a standalone or a start up for a larger collection/army.

Well worth the price. I might even buy 2.

GW had promised to send an 8th edition compatibility booklet, so I opted for this instead of the new starter. I'm not too fond of Nurgle, I guess.

Man, I dunno anymore. So I bought this after years of really liking the lore of 40k, and have never once played it. I hear so many bad things about 40k and Games Workshop in general, and that has kinda turned off a lot of my desire to get into the game. It's still sitting on my game shelf though. half-painted.

A nice set, but I prefer the 8th edition ruleset. Still, it helped add to my armies.

Anniversary present from wife. Models are nice. Got it to practice painting. Bonus points if I could actually play it. 

Really confusing referring to the tables on what to roll/what to look out for.

Rating given on the enjoyment I had assembling/painting the models up

RATING: N/A
These models are gorgeous.  Fun to assemble and paint.  takes a lot of skill to do it properly.

Game-wise it can be pretty epic in scale which I quite dig but certainly requires forethought for army selection and a lot of purchases to get to that point.

I'll get there.

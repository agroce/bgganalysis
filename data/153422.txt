[ESP] Un juego de colocación de losetas, tal vez demasiado sencillo para mi gusto. No creo que permanezca en mi colección pues al grupo en general no pareció emociconarle en lo más mínimo. Definitivamente Carcassonne tiene un feeling similar pero es muy superior.
Mi única recomendación sería para iniciar a alguien en el hobby, pues las reglas son simples y el tema es agradable. Un gamer en cambio no lo apreciará...

Based on only one 2-player game.
Tile laying game with a clear objective: create garden in which your colour is majoritary.  Played with 2 is different, but my impression is that it is a nice game that can be sometimes played a bit nasty (blocking the gardeners).  Looks quite nice.

I'm surprised by how few people talk about this game. It's a really nice tactical battle for supremacy, with a little bit of luck and a whole lot of game in positioning. Smart, lightish game, well worth trying out. 2p game variant is great also, reducing the impact of luck on the game as well.

Played the Android app on the phone, it was boring. There are dozens of better tile laying games where  Maori remain on my top. 

Here, the options looks too constrained as long as the active player only has one tile on his turn and with less scoring oportunities than in Carcassonne.

Elsőre csak kettesben próbáltuk, úgy nem működött teljesen jól, de akartam adni neki még egy esélyt többen is. Milyen jól tettem. Hármasban teljesen más értelmezést nyert a játék, szuper szórakoztató volt, volt benne szerencse, de lehetett bőven agyalni, optimalizálni a dolgokat. Van benne egy kicsi egymás tologatása vagy visszafogása aspektus is, ami nagyon jól működött nekünk, de azért megfelelő hozzáállást igényel a játékosoktól. Szuper jó kis játék. 3-4-en felmerül bennem, hogy jobb mint a carcassonne.

Carcassonne-ish "draw a tile and play it" business, except that the little area control battles of Carcassonne are limited in scope here because no matter what each corner can only have four tiles. (That's a good thing.) In my one play, the location of each player's gardeners only mattered occasionally. Well put-together, if not very original.

RATING: 7
Decent tile-laying game that is clearly a descendant of "Carcassonne", but different enough to be its own beast. Here you use the tiles to obtain majorities in your color, which score you a point when a flower bed is completed. There is also some tactical blocking by moving gardeners around. Nothing groundbreaking, but good enough as a family game. The only drawback is that it needs a variant to work with two players, with each player using two colors. Surprisingly, Devir's version looks nicer than the original edition from Kosmos.

RATING: 5
Serene family type tile laying game, with some take that element.
Sure the theme is pasted on, but i find the flowers to have a soothing effect on my psyche.
Looking at your next tile as soon as you laid your last is advisable, in order to keep
downtime short (except when you wanna place your joker tile).

RATING: 8.7
First and foremost, this is a beautiful game.  If you look at it even halfway through and how the board spans out across the table, it's really wonderful to look at.  It's also a very calm, enjoyable experience to play through.  There is a good amount of player interaction with slight bits of "take that" but, for the most part, everyone is sort of doing their own things in hopes that what others do helps them more than hurts them throughout.  I will admit, there's a good bit of luck here but, it's no different than that of Carcassonne.  Also, the gardener mechanic is really great as it does limit tile placement but, can also lead to some thought with the actions that are available on each turn.

RATING: 7
A flowery version of Carcassonne with a dash of Metro. As in the grand-daddy of all modern tile-laying games, you draw one tile on your turn and try to place it as good as possible. There's not much long-term planning and it's a bit lighter than Carcassonne. Fine for casual play and constructive players who like the visual appeal of a landscape developing on the table. Competitive players might worry about the kingmaking opportunities.

I do not like this game. Pretty much on every move of the game you have to make a decision who to hurt or who to help. It is pretty much the epitome of a kingmaking game (I dispise kingmaking games). I searched for a clever move for the whole time we were playing (perhaps 1.5 hours or 2 hours? or maybe it just seems like it lasted forever) and couldn't find a single one. Instead I found many mediocre moves which were invalidated because of the tile placement rules. Furthermore you cannot look ahead in this game because you have draw a tile on your turn. You cannot draw one ahead of time because you might want to play your special tile which means that you cannot draw a tile. This further made the game a long and a dismal affair.

This might be okay for 2 or 3 players, but not for 4 in my opinion.

Egyáltalán nem rossz játék, de a Gardens of Alhambra után több, mint 20 évvel kicsit kevésnek érzem. A kivitelezés mindenesetre minőségi, a bábuk mozgatásában pedig van némi taktikai lehetőség, még ha a lapkahúzás során nem is kevés a szerencse szerepe. Nekem a rajzok is tetszenek. Az én szívemhez mindenesetre a Gardens of Alhambra közelebb áll.

Good tile-layer in which you really have to balance helping yourself vs. helping the opponent. The player blocking element is not very prominent though, because you can't place your gardener wherever you want, it's always on the edge of the board.

Light and pleasant tile-laying game in which players are creating a shared garden and fighting for scoring opportunities.

Underrated and extremely accessible.

Enjoyed the single play, through want to play with more as the 2-player game is just a glorified 4-player with each player controlling two colors of flowers.  I've always enjoyed tile-laying games and this one is no exception.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]Tough one to judge a year later because I really think this game suffered with two players. Every game always came down to who was going to place their tenth (and winning) garden tile. There was absolutely no tension in the game because of this. I think it would have been much better with more players, but no one in my family was interested in playing so it has since left our collection.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- The theme and artwork are beautiful, love the aesthetic of the flower bed drawings [i](they look like 1950's floral fabric patterns)[/i].
- The biggest surprise for me is how well it plays with 2*, which has become my preferred player count.
- I don't know how the designer figured it all out, but the placement of the 4 colors on each tile is always less than ideal. When playing a 2p game you are almost always giving your opponent a leg up in another flower bed when placing tiles.
- It takes a lot of planning and a bit of luck, but you can finish multiple flower beds on one turn which is extremely satisfying. 
- The tie breaker is perfect and since the scores are fixed [i](you can score a maximum of 10/8 points)[/i] this could have easily made the conclusion of the game anticlimactic. 
  [i]Tie breaker rule - you have to count how many sections of each flower bed are match the color of the flower bed tile you place. This adds to the strategy because you are constantly trying to complete flower beds with a 2 color majority. [/i]

*I wasn't going to get the game once I read the 2p rules because it sounded like it wouldn't be as streamlined to play since both players control 2 colors. However; what I found was that the 2p game is actually the most tactical game, where you can really plan your future moves since only one other person is placing a tile between your turns.[/i]

RATING: 7
Pleasant theme coupled with ruthless game play. Players complete flower beds in their own colour but can sabotage their opponents' flower beds as their pawns amble through the garden. Light and fast playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A draw a tile / place a tile game. There's not much to it, making it family friendly at least. A flowerbed is made in the corner wherever four tiles are touching, and if the majority of the 4 colours in that flowerbed are yours, that's a VP. You can only place where your meeple can travel to, so there's some blocking going on with each players second meeple to force people to place adjacent to where their meeple is, rather than giving them freedom to move along paths to somewhere else and place. And that's the guts of the game - blocking plus getting lucky with the way paths come out. It was casual fun, but not meaty enough for me for the timeframe.

Jogo muito bonito e igualmente agradável de jogar. Num estilo carcassonesco mas suficientemente distinto, apresenta características tanto de area control, como de area enclosure.

RATING: 8
Tile laying to create a shared garden. As the fourth tile of each corner point is placed, one player is allowed to claim the completed flowerbed (or perhaps no player, if a tie has been forced). Placement dictated by matching paths & streams, but you also need one of your gardener pawns to be able to walk to the new tile, so there are opportunities for blocking.

In some ways there's an echo of Dirk Henn's Carat (Gardens of Alhambra), but its mainly in the notion of completing a 4-tile group, and the theme/artwork. In Gardens, the tile-positioning is more constrained (& players can block each other), the scoring far simpler.

Game includes a "short game" option, rules for a 2v2 team game, and 2 player is played with 2 colours each.

Attractive artwork that becomes a lush garden as the game develops. I've got the Kosmos edition, which seems to have slightly less vibrant colours than the Spanish edition, and lacks some of the Spanish edition's little artistic touches.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This felt incredibly gentle to the extent that I wasn't sure there was a game there, but one player (who'd played before) started blocking and playing tactically and won. So there's clearly more to this meets the eye.

However, the luck of the draw felt pretty extreme in determining the winner, as does kingmaking which seems to be pretty hard to avoid.

Gardens is a great looking game about planting a lovely garden in which your favorite color flowers are dominant.  The tile laying is Carc-esque with matching features on different sides but with the twist that your pawns need to walk through garden paths to where you are laying your tile.  This added spatial aspect and potential blocking is really interesting... but it also might have made the game more thinky and AP prone than I would really like especially when luck of the draw rears its ugly head so much.  The garden you end up making is quite lovely though so I'd like to play some more to see if the fun shows up more with experience.

Playing with young kids is really fun though.  Just ignore moving the gardeners and let them have fun getting those garden tiles on the board where you can.  Much more engaging for my young ones than something like Carcassonne when played like this.

First played at Games Expo 2012, and rejected on the basis that it didn't play with two. Revisited in 2013, with a larger gaming group available now, and have found it to be a really solid European-style pirate game. The dice-placement mechanics are utilised well (in the vein of Kingsburg, Castles of Burgundy etc.), the rules are accessible. Playing time is not excessive. There is a nice levelling mechanic, whereby players breaking into the lead (regarding notoriety at least) will pretty soon be shot down by the Royal Navy. And to top it off, I now find the designer has posted 2-player rules on the forum. Fabulous.

I should note, a few components disappoint, and for me are not fit for purpose. The ridiculously thin card-paper used for the "dry-assembly" treasure chests and hostages are just asking to bend and tear. I have immediately substituted these for meeples (Oregon) and chests (Diamant) but it is annoying to have to do so. That said, it's a small publisher, and all other components are great.

RATING: 7.2
The components aren't that great, and the very thin line around some of the upgrades is hard in figuring out what colour that upgrade is for, and presents a challenge for fully-sighted people, and therefore is probably a nightmare for the colour-blind.

Generally, though, it's a good game, although not one you'll be wanting to play all the time. If you look in the dictionary under "multi-player solitaire", you will find a picture of Pirates of Nassau, which is (by far) the game's biggest fault. There is nothing you can do to interfere with other players; well, actually, there is but you are always surprised when they cry out, "I needed that ship!" In other words, your aggressive moves against other players are usually unintentional: they just happen. It really needs a mechanic that allows you to attack another player who has just taken a spot you had your eyes on, a la Carson City.

The second problem with the game is the use of the dice for ship placement: you are really, REALLY restricted in where you can go with only three dice. One more would have been better.

The third problem is the ship upgrades. Most of them don't help all that much, and require all kinds of preconditions for you to actually make use of them.

The fourth problem is the rules. For a not very deep game, the rules are quite complicated and fiddly!

So with so many negatives, why have I rated it as high as a 7.2? Because it's an inoffensive game (a good game, even) that quite easily could have been a GREAT game, but missed the boat.  I've played Merchants&Marauders. Merchants&Marauders is an excellent pirate game. Merchants&Marauders is one of my favourite games. Pirates of Nassau, you're no Merchants&Marauders.

A better version of Kingsburg with a pirate theme. We played with the "official" two-player variant, which worked okay, but made the game drag. Unless it were shortened the game probably doesn't scale well for two: by the last round both of us had completely expanded and filled our ships, which seemed a little too easy IMO. I also felt that after four turns or so, it was no longer challenging enough to defeat the merchants and Navy ships. I'd love to see a third "red deck" of Navy cards with really challenging ships to show up near the end of the game. I'd also love to see some rules for attacking other players, which would lend more of a pirety-Ameritrash feel to the game and might make things more interesting.

RATING: 7.5
I thought this game was pretty good. Use dice placement as a movement mechanic and has an mechanic to prevent a runaway player effect. My only criticism of the game was the components which if you read the designers comments was due to poor communication with the foreign factory who bollox up their instructions but since it was their first game they couldn't afford to get it redone. This was a real shame as the game deserved a better ranking.

I swear, had you told me that this game had been successfully Kickstarted, I'd have believed it. This is a box full with bits, some rules to join them all together, and lacking an actual and interesting [i]game[/i], which is a genuinely useful definition of what it means to be a Kickstarter game.

The components are a teensy bit hohum: the cards were tile framed, not cut; there are slight miscuts; the treasure chests while nice in idea are far too flimsy to be useful; some chits are seriously too tiny; etcetera. To be honest I found it no great hindrance as I seriously doubt you'd play this title more than once anyway. Perhaps two or three times to be absolutely sure. So the box doesn't get any deduction for these little gripes. It does get a lot of deduction for being a shitty game, though. There is very little for the players to do; and what there is, is usually in response to some random event, like a card draw or a dice roll. This bolsters my suspicion that Pirates of Nassau started out as a simulation of piracy rather than an actual game about it: players just move over a board looting ships and obtaining resources without there being any real challenge to it, then face the actual brake in their snowball engine in the form of the Royal Navy, then convert the looted goods into things which rev up the engine. Repeat at finitum. 

Take for example the dice selection which appears fresh and novel... until you work but the amount of possibilities which turns out to be a depressingly small number made nearly vanishingly small once you've used the first die. It gets worse as soon as people start attacking harbours, because these are then removed from the game. I suppose it fits in with being a lawless pirate, but in [i]game[/i] terms it just means that matters become even more constricted. The snowball part has been done in better ways in countless other titles: there is no need to resort to the way it has been given shape in Pirates of Nassau. And why is it the case that the bigger the ship the faster it can theoretically go...??! (Which can indeed be the case—look at the [i]Preußen[/i], for example, or the [i]Royal Clipper[/i], but is unfortunately not true for the ships in this game as brigs are faster than galleons!) Apart from wanton looting and destruction the entire pirating thing boils down to continuous comparison of two numbers. Weee...

I really cannot imagine playing this game with the full compliment of 5 players: contention for resources would be murder, empty fields yield useless modifiers which can be turned in only one at a time, and there is really no way to stop a chaotically determined runaway leader who begins to amass sufficient ship power to conserve powerful cards to fend off the English Navy.

And so it goes on and on and on. One play was more than enough.

Picked this game for £10 in a clearance sale. Bargain! 
It feels thematic enough, good for a euro, which is great if like me you like pirates. The four different victory point drivers mean there is always something to focus on, and overall the mechanics are solid. The dice allocation mechanic for movement is particularly neat. And I like being able to expand the size of the ship. The game could maybe be a bit more challenging though: the Royal Navy boats only rarely pose a threat. And the hostages lack any personality or variation, which seems a bit of a missed opportunity thematically and in terms of game play. Also the components are a bit hit and miss. But overall a good game I'd have been happy to pay more for.

Très bon jeu !
Il souffre d'une édition pas encore à la hauteur des grands éditeurs qui font faire des tirages de plusieurs milliers d'exemplaires, mais Pirates of Nassau reste un excellent jeu.
J'adore les jeux de gestion de ressources mais je commence peut-être un peu à me lasser des jeux de placement d'ouvrier pour récupérer des ressources.

Dans Pirates of Nassau on récupère aussi des ressources (3 sortes) mais le mécanisme pour les récupérer consiste à affronter des bateaux pour gagner leur cargaison.
On se sert du jet de dés pour aller se battre contre plusieurs bateaux et ça change !

Avec les ressources on achète des armes supplémentaires pour affronter des bateau avec une cargaison plus importante, on agrandi le bateau pour stocker plus de ressources durant le tour, des objets précieux qui compteront beaucoup pour les majorités finales et donc pour marquer les point de victoires.

Bref, un jeu qui a séduit toute la tablée (1ère partie entière pour les 4 joueurs)

Plunder merchant ships and ports, smuggle goods, ransom hostages and improve your ship and crew to be the best pirate.

Plays: 1.
Type: VP race = a game where you race to collect victory points (fastest/most).
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources.
Randomness: Low – dice, cards and tiles, but you always draft them.

Replayability: Low. This is too long to play again immediately and I’m unsure about depth.
Fun: Average. Pirating is fun. Almost all the pirating clichés are here.
Memorability: Low. It’s a VP engine that doesn’t create stories.

Thematic integration: Decent. The scoring felt disconnected from the game play though.
Components: A bit fiddly, there are a lot of components. It goes for “more is better”. Dice, cards and tiles – why settle for one when you can have all three?

Who will like this: Strategy gamers that want a pirate theme with their VP engine.

RATING: N/A
This was a fun, pirate-y game. I liked the ship improvement aspect, and the tactics of having to balance your attacks on the merchant ships with protecting yourself against the British Fleet. I also liked the balance of keeping your infamy high enough to get end game points, but low enough to be able to get better board position and avoid the worst of the British ships. Overall, I felt the game ended just as my ship was starting to get cool, so I would almost like to have the game go longer. Since scoring is done by who has the most in each particular category, I don't see why the British ship deck couldn't be increased or recycled somehow to lengthen the game. This is after one play, so maybe we just weren't being as efficient as we could be.

Il gioco mi ricorda Kingsburg per l'utilizzo dei dadi e per la scelta dell'azione in base al numero uscito con la particolarità che i dadi andranno 'risolti' uno alla volta e non tutti insieme. Ricca componentistica che però pecca in dettagli doco curati, lo scrigno ma anche i personaggi rapiti sono molto delicati e poco funzionali. Il gioco però risulta simpatico e piacevole anche se molto soggetto al lancio dei dadi. L'interazione è molto presente e porta a rubarsi migliorie e azioni mentre l'ordine di scelta favorisce il giocatore più in difficolà (un po' come a Power Grid). Gioco molto sottovalutato.

This is probably one of the most immersive pirate themed games that I have come across due to the myriad of activities going on: walking the plank, looting a port, fighting the Royal Navy. It took me almost completely until the end of the game before I realized that there is limited player interaction. It really didn't matter. This is an overlooked gem of a game and my friends would like to play it again.

I only played a test game at Essen "Spiel 12" fair, and we didn't finish the game there. So I see no clear startegy how to play this game yet. However I would like to play it again. I like how the ship can be upgraded by adding sail-tiles, cannons and crew.

I have to rate this as an 8 since after two plays I really want another game. I like the different ship development options that go with different strategies, and the pros and cons of going for an early lead in notoriety and taking a pasting from the Royal Navy or hanging back to let others take the pain. But others in our group found it too slow - just a first-game learning curve in my opinion, but I'm struggling to find players as a result. Frustrating.

One play.  I enjoyed it, and would play it again, despite the game having a number of flaws.  It went on too long, and past the point where ship upgrades had removed much of the challenge.  The person who had the best first round and got the best upgrades proceeded to run away with the game: though I'm pleased to see a pirate game that doesn't feature pvp conflict, I thought the RN wasn't very effective in holding back the leader. Some of the physical design is poor - yet in other respects is good quality.

Great game with good mechanics that is very well balanced.  shouldn't be anyone running away with this one unless everyone except of one player is completely inept.  No chance involved in this one, straight up strategy and the fun of being a pirate!

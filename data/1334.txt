Looks like Teuber came up with the enjoyable tile-laying mechanic used by Carcassonne.  Scouts add an interesting element to the game.  A bit on the dry side, making it feel even longer than it is.

The scouts/huts are a good example of only slightly ignorant design. The original is far better. The map more-or-less features a sea-monster's anus so you can't say there wasn't a warning.

Yes, there's a lot of luck involved, with the drawing of newly discovered tiles; but, in fact, there's actually less luck here in Entdecker than there is in Herr Teuber's more popular Settlers of Catan. It must always be borne in mind that this game, above all else, is a game that requires very, very careful financial management. You cannot simply spend as much money as you want every turn, or else (through the income generating die)you will eternally be supplying the other players with gold. When cash is low, explore little; when cash is high, go on lengthier journeys. And always become nervous when you find yourself with four gold pieces left. In addition to the economic decisions, tense strategic decisions are needed for placement of units, and in particular, the scouts. The rule system is remarkably easy and straight-forward, so much so that my 71 year old, non-gaming mother-in-law enjoys it! I love it! Hey, Herr Teuber: how about some historical variants for Entdecker, bitte?

The crux of the game is figuring out where your opponents will go and thus deciding whether you need to (or can) compete with them. On half the board, the decisions are open knowledge. On the other half, it has a deduction element to it.

I enjoyed the game, but it has some pretty clear flaws that I could see bothering many (though they didn't bother me).

You have to commit to tile purchases, before you get to see them (assuming you choose to go for the blind pull), and then may well end up not being able to place any of them, due to the building restrictions. On top of that, there are event tiles with bonuses and penalties which you will eventually have to pull, as all the regular tiles clear out, which may force you to take a penalty. Overall, you may get screwed by the tile pull and extra screwed with a bonus penalty, through no fault of your own.

And then there's the money earning mechanism of the die that you roll, which gives more money to everyone else than it gives to you. I can only imagine that this was intended as a super clunky mechanism to punish people for trying to make big moves. But it doesn't work terribly well for that (the blind tile pull is more effective). I had the die for roughly half the game and I still won. You rarely spend more than a 4-6 gold in a turn, and you can usually earn that much with the die, so it ends up not accomplishing much. It does hinder you a little bit, but mostly it just is sort of annoying because it *feels* like a clunky/poorly designed mechanism.

The randomness of the game seemed to be mitigated by the length of the game. The money die mostly mitigated itself (and if you really wanted to get rid of it, you probably could by being spend-thrift for a few turns). But, in both cases, I could see some players being pretty turned off.

But ultimately, I like games that are easy to teach and where I'm playing against the other players instead of the game. This game accomplishes both of those, so I did end up enjoying it.

This game is pretty fun. I never played old Entdecker, so I can't compare the two. I like how this game is similar to Carcassonne in the tile laying, but there is no chance of an island not being completed. The huts are fun and I like them a lot. But honestly, they aren't the greatest game mechanic.

We would say this is the love child of Carcassone and Tsuro of the Seas but this originally came out before both. It might be the best tile exploration game out there. You explore the undiscovered seas looking for land to score. You can go cheap and hope for the best flipping tiles that might or might not help you build your route. Or you spend more to start with tiles that you can see how they can be laid out. Along the way you make friends with the natives and try to earn their favor. It plays very easily but it plays a bit long for us. That might be because we are just playing 2 players though we can see some AP and down time issues coming in with 3-4. Regardless it is an awesome game and certainly a keeper.

Only played once, using one of the pre-set scenarios.  It&#039;s okay, but I prefer the original Entdecker (though with a couple of the Neuen rules).  The New version has more &quot;meat&quot; and is more tactical, but that also means it takes longer, and that moves, especially late in the game, are more prone to analysis (though not necessarily paralysis - the game doesn&#039;t stop, it&#039;s just slows down as things unfold).

The original was far better and a lot less complicated - the new 'huts' concept is a complete waste of time.

I belive this was orginally called 'Entdecker II', it did not sell so it was  then changed to 'Entdeker', completly forgetting about the original.

I REALLY don't understand why they scapped the original, a quick , simple, entry game.

Entdecker is a push-your-luck entry-level game that features an exploration aspect to area control.  There are several aspects about Entdecker that appeal to me.  The opportunity to setup a toll system along a coveted route, competing for islands, and the bluffing behind scout placement.  However, the game takes a little too long for what it is and there is a ton of luck.

I tired of Carcassonne quickly.  Entdecker felt like someone took Carc and added a fresh new level to it, the way you must "plan" your expedition, pay for it, and then execute it, with the chance of cutting it short for various reasons.  I didn't mind the villager end-game bonus thing, but it seemed WAY overvalued point-wise.

We now play the suggested variant where the second place guy on each hut gets half points.

RATING: 6
Tile placement and area control.  Fun as the islands grow and shift under you, some good strategic decisions regarding how much exploring to attempt.  Jungle huts feel like a tacked-on second game, and they swing the final scoring wildly (you can't win without the jungle huts).  That feels a bit odd, as the island portion becomes secondary and really is just keeping you in the game so you can win with the huts.

It's a fun game, but I see no point in choosing it over any other more recent and more polished games. I guess one could say this is "out of date".

RATING: 6
2001.  2-4p, 90 min; An enjoyable game involving racing, action point allowance, territory control and exploration.  The ability to pay to choose the tile that you discovered seems wrong, but makes this game more strategic.  The race to view and win the huts adds excitment to basic Entdecker.  There seems to be too much of a point spread for huts.

Wow, I like the Tongiaki-like exploring, I like the Carcassonne-like island ownership, I LOVE the tile-purchase system... This would be a GREAT game if it weren't for those darn random HUTS!  I went from 1st place by a MARGIN to almost last because of unlucky hut selection.

Great game, one of the best "explore the map" mechanics I've ever seen. My strongest memory of this game though is one session I played with two friends. The imbalance of luck was astonishing, I got almost every goldmine and one of my friends got every single pirate. I couldn't stop laughing and to his credit my unlucky friend was so philosphical about his misfortune I couldn't help but admire it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is second only to Carcasonne for 'random, guided exploration' type games.

Everyone in my group really enjoys these type of "build the board as you go" type games. The only thing that makes this one sit on the shelf as much as it does is the player count. If it supported 5-6 players, it would get a lot more play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I love Settlers, and I like so many aspects of this game: the theme, the cleverly designed island tiles, the fact that some parts of the board are more expensive to sail on, the risk of taking unknown tiles versus paying more for certainty. I like the trump scoring system for the islands (settlement > fortress > scout) and I even thought the secondary scoring mechanic with the huts was a good consolation for players who didn't win the big islands. In nearly every way this appears to be an excellent game.

It is not an excellent game. Far from it. The mechanic of rolling for income only if you're dirt poor, and then giving extra money to the players who already have more money than you, is such a broken and horribly devised one that I can't for the life of me understand why this game was published in its current form. The tile placement mechanic, though a seemingly light and fun activity, is actually incredibly tedious and far too time consuming for what it is. This game should be 45 minutes tops, not 2 hours.

I like the exploration aspect and the competition to finish off small islands quickly to get scouts onto the village tracks early.  Sometimes it can get a bit too long though (2 hours) given how simple the gameplay is.

Very nice game in many ways, but the "seed" points seem unbalancing. We have contemplated halving the final points for the huts, or at least reducing the spread (to 3/6/10, perhaps). As it is now, it seems like a lot of the really interesting tactical play during the game is muted by the huge swing in the seeds at the endgame. Despite this, still a good game and recommended; and as I say, if you find the seeds to be a problem after a few plays, just reduce their values.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good exploration game.  You MUST play all of your scouts to get tiki hut points, because, unfortunately, the game usually boils down to who scores the most in the tiki huts.  Rating would be higher without this problem.  I suppose the game could easily be played without the tiki huts though.

The first half of the game has some Carcassonne feel to it. But what I like the best is the way the treasure huts are handled. You are jockeying for the privelege to view secret information (what the value of the trasure in the hut is)...but you are also jockeying for who will ultimately get the treasure. Some nice bluff and counterplay there, which really makes the game spicey.

An excellent exploration-game! A good blend of luck and strategy. Deciding when to draw in blind and when to pay for a certain counter is crucial when staking claims for islands. And the hunt for the most valuable huts can be quite exciting. The more I play it, the less luck-driven it seems.

Meh.  Not a bad game, but it seems to similar to the tile-laying of Carcassone, albeit heavier.  For the length of time it takes to complete, the game just doesn't grasp and hold me.  The randomness of the tile drawing is even more so than Carcassonne.

A nice tile-laying exploration game. Explore and settle islands more effectively than your opponent(s).

Some trickiness involved where certain tile placements can force certain other tile placements to happen automatically and immediately.

The core game is much like the city development in Carcassonne: you build islands one tile at a time and then score them when they're completed. Usually, many players will score for the same island, and the lower scorers often will have a leg up on the 'hut' scoring at the end of the game. So, do you let another player 'win' the island so that you can enhance your score later? Carcassonne is better, but Entdecker works pretty well.

Players commit some gold to declare in advance how many tiles they are going to reveal, and use them to fill in the board (which is blank at the beginning). As the islands emerge, players may settle pieces on the island. Completed islands are scored for points, and pieces begin exporing the interior in the vague hope of being the first to discover the potato and other exotic plants! There have been a few changes from the first edition of Entdecker (interior exploring, open and closed tile stacks, etc) and it appears to be all for the better.

This seems like a good game. There may be a little too much luck at times for the depth and length of this game. I would definitely like to try this again.

One player ended up rolling for gold almost every time (a decided disadvantage). Maybe it was inexperience / poor play, but I know others have had similiar experiences.

Pretty fun. A little hard to come up with fun, new, initial tile placements which are interesting and don't result in the mother-of-all-islands deciding the game.

RATING: 6
The large hard mapboard depicts a sea serpent for counting score, an uncharted territory and some jungle area. The idea is that players start from one edge of the board with a ship and by paying fees they get tiles to be placed on the uncharted map. They try to fit the tile in such a way so as to complete the features of islands, place scouts on them and score points. Upon scoring, players may place their scouts in the jungle area where they discover exotic goods like pineapples, cocoa etc. At the end of the game the player with the majority of scouts gets the benefit of scoring more for the exotic goods. Although concept is intriguing and rules are straightforward the game suffers from downfalls. Players are never short of money; when budget is limited you just throw a die and money fall from the sky. All players use the same ship; the downfall being that at the start of each player's turn he gets to start with the same ship from whatever part of the map-edge he feels like! (not very realistic). A lot of gold coins are wasted on tiles that do not fit properly with the features the player is exploring thus discarding it in a pile. This pile is going to be re-used when all tiles are drawn adding in more discarded tiles as the uncharted map gets smaller and only few tiles might fit properly on the map. There is something missing here for the game to be really interesting and make players eager to play it again.

Played a game of this and enjoyed it, but not sure I would really seek out another game. It feels quite dated (and is indeed 15 years old) and there is really not much in the way of player interaction. 

You can add forts and strongholds to islands you have found in the hope that another player will have to trace a voyage past them on a later turn and thus pay you a toll but in practice this was completely ineffectual as there are so many routes it was simple enough to skirt round opponents and thus avoid the toll. 

It also feels a little strange that all players share the boat token and each turn begin an entirely new voyage, probably from an entirely new start point. I think I would have liked my own ship and maybe some bonus for continuing a previous voyage, but maybe that's just me.

The gold mechanic is very unusual and quite interesting, but slightly skewed with one player rolling for gold almost all game, thus giving other players a slight advantage ....maybe

I really like the artwork upon the tiles and all, save for the open sea tiles are different and unique in some way, and at game end the board looks really good. Events are ok. They are potentially damaging enough that you have to consider them when traveling, even though good events outnumber the bad, the bad potentially ruin your turn.

Sold in a board game bundle in 2017.

Every time I've played Entdecker (Mayfair version, same as Die Neuen) I've had a great time. One cool thing about this game is that, for the first three quarters of the game, it is not at all clear what one should do with ones move. The clarity comes with experience and with developing your personal strategy. I like the mechanic of needing to play lowly scouts in large quantity on islands in order to grab jungle path points, which are about a third of the total points. I recommend this exception to rolling for income: if a 2 or 3 is rolled or chosen, every player receives 2 or 3 gold including the roller. This small rule change prevents the economic starvation of a player that sometimes occurs.

Played 1 time. Great improvement in rules over the orginal. I tried to tweak the Neuen rules to the old version of Entdecker, but it doesn't work because of the lack of space (smaller grid) and the lack of explorers and any way to make them worth more. Good game though with nice bits and beautiful theme. Good non-gamer appeal.

I happen to like that, so I like this game. I just can't always find someone to play with.

This is a great exploration game.  However, the exploration is occasionally odd: travel is sometimes forced in a certain direction based on the tile drawn.  It takes a fair bit of time to teach but is easy to grasp once things get going.  It may even be worth teaching some of it as you play, perhaps on a reduced area of the board.

(2 player rating) Entdecker has more depth than I expected. There are a number of tactical opportunities that one can discover and take advantage of during the course of the game. Look-ahead pays off. I would expect that the better player would win the vast majority of games. Since the game take 1-2 hours, luck averages out and therefore plays a small role.

Another good one from Klaus Teuber. While not the best game around, it is very well-suited to two and four players. It's a game you play when you don't care to think to hard about strategy, and the imperialist bent has some games being a fierce competition for islands. All right, but not one of my favorites.

The updated Kosmos/Mayfair Entdecker plays much better than the original Goldsieber edition, fixing all of its most grievous problems.  Some gamers have complained about the bonus huts for the "used" explorers.  I don't mind them, although I think the values of the huts could use some tweaking: definitely a tighter point spread and possibly a bit lower values overall.  I also like the changes to the income system, the costs for entering on the "wrong" edge of the board, and especially the new rules allowing players to buy face up tiles.

My only reservation about the new version is that it extends the playing time into a range that feels slightly too long for the game's weight.  Okay, that's not my only reservation.  My other reservation is that even with all the improvements, Entdecker is not a great game.  I'm happy to play it occasionally, but I would usually suggest something like Carcassonne or Goldland or El Caballero over Entdecker.

A contemporary to Carcassonne, Entdecker plays in a similar fashion. Strategically, discover islands and place units, hoping that once the island is discovered, you have the most units on that island. A mix of exploring via tile placement, majority control on islands and treasures, and a more direct way to place tiles makes this a pleasant surprise. 

Note: For 2 players, the "gain gold roll" feels unbalanced. It would work with 3+, but for 2, the poor stays poor. A slight variant may fix this. Also, the rule book is long-winded for the lower complexity of the game.

A very nice tile-layer with good components. There's a little bit of luck, but enough tight strategy that you can insulate yourself from it. It's a lot of fun to make the map. My only complaint is that the income mechanic is flawed. One person always gets stuck making money for everyone else.

It has a lot of randomness, but I like the calculated risk aspect. Always enjoyable, with important little decisions all the time. Some component design issues, though. The product tokens are annoyingly printed in both sides, forcing the player to take the huts off the board in order to place the tokens without revealing them to others. The huts themselves are made by two pieces which could have been better designed to fit together. Beautiful board, good artwork, but very ugly and dull wooden pieces.

This is a cute little tile playing game, where you have some information (but not a lot) and can spend money to buy the "tile of your dreams".  It has layout and territory aspects, as well as randomness in the "Scout trails" that lead to bonus chips.  

Personally, I like the original Entdecker better.  The money method is better in this game, but all other aspects slow down play and allow the "bonus huts" to be a more important sub-game than the main ship exploration game.

Great tile-laying game that simulates the feel of exploring the unknown. Yes, there is luck in the draw, but isn't that what the unknown was all about? Great fun as you and the other players circumnavigate large and small islands, trying to complete exploration, in a race to get those scouts on the jungle paths to score key victory points at the very end. Good with either three or four. 15 minutes to explain, and about 1.5-2 hours for a first game with newbies.

Update (2/26/09): just played a game with 3 other players that had played before. The game seems to go very quickly, with very little downtime, since there are only a limited set of decisions to make. Great fun, plenty of strategic and tactical play, mixed with pushing one's luck, and good immersion into the exploration theme, from what I consider to be a "classic" euro design.

Update (07/24/09): Taught 3 newbies. 15 minutes to teach. 4P game took 2.5 hrs, since some were prone to AP. I keep forgetting how wonderful this game is, and it is always well received by newcomers, even those who are relatively new to board gaming, as this has unique mechanics, exciting game play, and real sense of exploration. I'm upping this from an '8' to a '9'. Although it is simple in mechanics, the strategy and tactics make this a meatier, yet still accessible gateway game. All this talk about it being like Carcassone is rubbish--this is a superior game.

Update (09/20/09) 6 recorded plays: This is a 'classic' that people want to revisit again and again after playing it once. The notion that the original Entdecker is 'better' than this version is utter nonsense. I haven't played the original, but can imagine how it would be from the current version. In that light, the original exploration mechanics would be simple and straight-forward. However, the inclusion of jungle paths and secret VPs incentivize players to complete small islands quickly, as they battle for control of each path, or they may go for the grand strategy of circumnavigating larger islands for greater points. There is a fine balancing act to be struck here--ignore the paths at your peril; however, not competing for the larger islands is also perilous. If planned properly, a player can suddenly dump a large number of scouts on the jungle paths. The view that there are two separate meta-games going on is missing the point--they are inexplicably intertwined, where the jungle paths could deliver the game. There is a bit of luck in the draw for the commodity, but poor draws could be overcome by cunning play on the board and on the paths, as well as some bluffing. Thus, the jungle paths transform a interesting, simple exploration game, into a life-or-death struggle for dominance of the islands, as well as the jungle paths. This is a 'great' game. I am upping this to a '10'.

Update (09/17/11) 9+ plays: Pulled this out after a long hiatus, and it still has staying power. The seemingly random elements all tie together nicely, for a unique game every time. Players try to avoid the "cycle of poverty", but that can be overcome with frugal financial management and lucky event draws. It is critical to adjust your play based on knowing exactly who in the turn order will be rolling the die. Players can improve their odds of picking good "random" events by tile-counting, and can minimize the effect of pirates by making sure they don't have too much money when they go for it. Knowing exactly how many good and bad event tiles are left, along with the potential tile alignments, should indicate if and when you go for an event tile. It is critical to complete small islands quickly early on to get a first-look at the jungle paths, and then make long-term plans to either secure them or abandon them and find/fight for other jungle paths. Forts are useful in the early game to "lock out" and de-incentivize other players from using specific routes, so that you alone have control over how surrounding islands develop from that route. This in turn leads to how you will score VP and scout placement on the jungle paths. Timing and turn order is critical in deciding whether to complete an island or not, as this also affects the play on jungle paths. Play to secure the "eye" can de-incentivize others, as is showing little interest on a particular path. All of these factors must be considered when deciding to purchase a open tile versus a hidden tile, or when to place a scout vs fort vs settlement. This game has many tactical options and considerations, with a grand strategic overlay, coupled with an interesting financial system. Contrary to what others have said, I believe there is nothing wrong with the jungle paths or the die-rolling mechanism where everyone else except the roller get an extra doubloon. The die rolls and jungle paths don't necessarily deliver the game, but they certainly help drive the game. It is this subtle, yet sophisticated interplay between the three elements of tiles, money, and jungle paths, that makes this game exciting, with an exploration theme that makes for memorable play.

Perhaps a little too much luck. Not just in the tiles but in all aspects. It really matters if someone is competing hard for an island or valuable hut (or if your initially explored huts are valuable or not). So if you were 'left alone' you can score heavily. But any competition harms both you and your competitor. Yet once you have invested to start dropping out of competition is not an option.

Hmmm. Lots to like but just not great.

Interesting ideas, but too much luck involved. More significantly, the income system is broken: the person who goes first tends to be the person rolling the dice for the whole game, which means they are always getting less income than everyone else. The only way to break the chain is to get luck with a special event tile.

Area control race game using similar mechanics to Carcassone for worker placement/area control (but allows multiple opponents in same island space).  Feels like a simpler version of Amerigo.  Only plays up to 4, fairly fast, very simple.  Some luck of the draw or you effectively miss a turn (but turns are very fast).

Apr08:  Please spank me now.  I read the description, it sounded interesting.  I traded for it.  I read the rules, it sounded depressingly boring.  I played it.  It was depressingly boring.  The only real decisions are:

1. Where to start an expedition (Not that deep all the time.)
2. How much to pay (Pretty much it.)

The rest of the game was pretty much on autopilot.  An autopilot that still took 2 fast players almost 2 hours.

Eventually, I started drawing event tiles on purpose just to add spice.  I also rolled for income the whole game.  I still won due to luck hut pulls.

I don't need to play that again.

Nice exploration game that just missed the mark to make it truly great. Players spend gold to explore tiles and form up islands. Islands can be colonised and converted to victory points when complete. The New Entdecker seems to fix a few of the problems and makes it a better game.

I'm a sucker for tile placement and exploration games so maybe I'm a little biased.  I just really love playing this one.  It is true that the end game with the natives on the island can skew the game - but if everyone goes into the game knowing how powerful they are, then everyone should play a bit differently.  Super fun!

The tile laying/area majority/financial management worked quite well.  The jungle track mechanism was quite dull in my 1 playing.  Once someone had the first scout on a track they knew whether to fight for it and noone else did and if it was valuable would often get a 2nd/3rd scout on the track to disuade anyone from competing for that track.  The only battles therefore occurred for the lesser valued tracks.  The area majority mechanisms seemed very static.

Entdecker is a clever and enjoyable game of seafaring, exploration, resource management, and area control. These various elements of the game work together nicely, providing players with a satisfying blend of strategy, tactics, risk, and luck. The game doesn't try to do too much or be more than it is, and this simplicity is part of its appeal. The addition of the huts offers further layers of strategy, making this version superior to its predecessor.

Lots of good clean fun; great implementation of an exploration theme (which is probably why my score for this is higher than others'). Got some concerns about the magnitude of the jungle path scoring, and I wonder if I would like the original version or some hybrid better... but for now, still in the "honeymoon phase" on this one until it gets more plays.

RATING: 8
The &quot;New&quot; Entdecker was much better than I was led to believe.  The new competition to control the huts works just fine and does not dominate game play at all.

What I really prefer in the New version is the fact that there is no bonus for completing islands.  As a result, islands are bigger and more hotly contested.  Also, you don&#039;t do funky geometry in an attempt to figure out a way to close an island.  The game becomes more like an exploration and less like a geometric puzzle.

An update to a favorite game of mine.  In truth, I think the huts are a detractor to the point of the game - but the gameplay on the map is greatly enhanced over the original.  

I strongly endorse Mark Johnson's suggested port of rules from this edition to the old version.  This hybrid of the two editions is the 'perfect' Entdecker.

As written, this edition plays much longer, and then trivializes what you just did by awarding lots of points off-board to the competition on the huts.  I'll play this version, but I much prefer to play the old version with some rules from this newer edition.

FABULOUS! My favorite Euro style game ever because it not only has a logic-thinking element to it, but it also appeals to the adventure gamer in me.

A surprise hit for me that I hadn't played until 2011. If you like Carcassonne and want to take it to the next level this is the game for you. The board is huge and gorgeous and the tile laying is even more cutthroat that Carcassone. The only downside is that it really should be played with 4 (3 may work, but I haven't tried it).

RATING: 4
This is a game which doesn't feel like a game: there are some rules which have no contribute in practise (like customs duty) and generally whole game is fairly non-specific.
Whatever the truth, Neuen Entdecker feels the same as any other games designed by Klaus Teuber: AND I don't like his games (only exception is Domaine). So this is not for me, but if you like Teubers games, you might want to try this.

It's a good game BUT it's too long! I really like how the game works, how you get the income and how you can explore the hut to get some "rare" and exotic plants. But the board is too big. Since the game is a bit dry and repetitive it makes for a longer experience than it should. Next time I will try to play it with the same dimension of board as the Old Entdecker.

Edit: We played with a smaller board and games were real good. Faster and more tight. This is a very good game if it can be played in about an hour.

A game I really enjoy. There can seem to be a lot of randomness in the tile draws, but the whole point is to put yourself in a situation where any number of draws helps you out. People who lost by a lot and blame it on luck usually made a lot of poor decisions that they didn't even realize they were making.

I am not a fan of the huts though.  I appreciate the need for another scoring mechanism and for a little bit of hidden points, but the mechanic seems very "tacked-on" and is too winner-take-all.

Also, there are some production quibbles.  The scout cylinders are too top-heavy and easily roll away.  The scoring track is the hardest to read I've seen.  And I wish they had included enough parts so that you could play any color with any number of players.

Fun tile-laying exploration game. Plenty of decision making from how far to explore on any given turn and which, if any, units to place on the discovered land masses. constant decision between placing large (and expensive) units to help garner island points, versus placing the weaker and cheaper explorer units, who can garner big bonus points at the end of the game.

This game really suprised me, I thought it was going to be a light family-style game.  Boy was I wrong, it turned out to be a bit of a brain-burner.  Players spend money to explore new islands and settle them.  Once an island is discovered whoever has the largest settlement adds up how many tiles made up the island, the second largest settler gets half that, 3rd gets 1/4th, 4th gets 1/8th.  It is an exploration game so there is a bit of luck involved in the tile draws (you need pieces to connect properly & there are some harmful cards: storms & pirates).  There's also another meta-game going on, in trying to gain majority at the huts (extra VPs).  It's a solid game but I found turn-order to be frustrating at times, when there were easy points to be scored & islands were completed before I got a chance to get in on the action.  UPDATE: knocked down a half point.  It's certainly a solid design but the combination of luck and clinical thinking involved can be difficult to accept.  That being said the luck (or probability perhaps) does enhance the exploration theme.  Still, I'd rather play Tongiaki or Lost Valley.

Carcassonne in the sea?.... but with a few extra scoring systems.
This game works well enough to be enjoyable, but suffers from "which bits fit where" and when empty spaces are automatically filled in, which makes the game feel over-complicated.
That said though, it is a fun game and should play quickly.

I've only played this a few times and haven't been overwhelmed yet by the experience. It is a solid game and is nice looking as well. It just doesn't have that pull to make me replay it often though but I do think it is a good solid 3rd tier type of game. I can see my rating rising slightly if I play more but 6 is about right at the moment.

Jeu sympa pour son 'age' gestion de tuile style a la carcassonne mais on suit le chemin du bateau et non les iles. Placement stratégique sur des iles de comptoir/colonie/ explorateurs qui permettent d'avoir des points en fonction de la taille de l'ile. Les explo vont rejoindre ensuite les huttes (bonus cachés) et revélés en fin de partie (attribués au joueur majoritaire). Des tuiles événements (positifs/negatifs) viennent pimenter le tout. Le choix des tuiles (cachée vs choisie) est aussi interessant avec une gestion de l'argent.

Object of the game is to place scouts, huts or fortresses on island pieces as the game board gets "explored". Points are awarded on islands for people who have majority of units. This first phase of the game is decent. But the next phase consists of placing scouts down one of 7 available paths. Each of these paths leads to a hidden victory point counter of 5, 10 or 15 points. The first scout down on that path can look at the hidden VP counter. Majority on the path will take the VPs, ties going to the one first on the path. It appeared in both games we played, the winner of these discovery paths was also the winner of the game (assuming everyone was close in the island discovery phase). Game hasn't been brought out since, but the game does have some neat ideas. I think this is Klaus Teber's weakest effort (compared to the Catan games). However, friend mentioned there maybe a fix to the discovery paths (limit them to less points, or less of a swing from 5 to 15), so we may try this game again soon.
June 14, 2004: Played a three player game, took 2 1/2 hrs including relearning the rules. Hut wars didn't appear to influence outcome that much. Might be a decent game after all, but only have 3 plays under my belt.

I don't know why we haven't played this one more than we have. It's not a bad game by any standard, but the board is a bit big and it is quite hard to get a good overview thus the game sessions have tended to drag. The set up always takes a while as the map cards have to be sorted into piles according to numbers. The game seems to divide people, personally I have not had a problem playing it but otoh will rarely suggest it. I've played it with quite a few people who could not be bothered to finish it. All around OK-ish.

A better game than Teuber's more famous Settlers of Catan, but one with a somewhat less compelling theme.  (You're placing tiles and you'll feel like you're doing exactly that, not courageously exploring mysterious frontiers.)  Nowhere near as luck-dependent as Settlers, but there's still some serious potential for screwage here.

Hmmm... the idea of exploring the sea seemed interesting but the gameplay turned out to be almost the exact opposite. Way too long for such a simple game. With two players the money die is punishing if you don't get out of the cycle of rolling the die every turn. No need to play this ever again since there are far superior game these days, although if someone suggests this and there's no alternatives I just might play this.

Carcassonne on the water! My wife loves this game. It's pretty fun to make your way through the waters and find land to settle. When islands are completed you score (similar to Carcassonne scoring). Also, instead of taking your meeple figure back to your own supply, they travel to the huts on the island. The first to the huts will draw a token from a bag; it will have a certain amount of points. At games end the majority of meeples at each hut by will score the points listed on the token hidden in the hut. 

The money seems endless at first, as soon as you have less than 4 coins you just roll for an amount of money. But later in the game, if you haven't saved your coins, it becomes more difficult to maneuver through the waters. 

A wonderful week night game that's a little bit meaty and really enjoyable to play.

RATING: 5
The general agreement was that this new version is better than the original. More game choices. Better money management options. The opportunity to sneak big comeback wins. There's too much luck with the huts, and there can be a money death spiral if one player falls short of money and the leaders spend equivalent amounts to him for a while - they just keep saving more and more more money over the poor guy until they're ready to spend big. The overall problem though is that the decisions aren't that interesting. Choose where to go and how many tiles you want to risk paying for, and reveal. Then pay to get a meeple on. Not much there, and yet the game can drag while people weigh up their start space option each turn.

This is a very nice family game, it's good to play with younger or less experienced players, since it is very easy to pick up but also challenging enough to captivate players interrest until the end of the game. It's also a fairly short game, which is a good thing for newcomers. This title is turning into a franchise now, I got knowledge of the "Jade", "Desert" and "Demon" versions... I looked up both the jade and desert versions on doctor easy's page... the jade version seemed preaty shallow to me, but the desert version cought my attention. So for those that enjoy the original game... keep your eyes opne for the newcomers, my bet goes to the desert one!

Fun game, easy to pick up, though the rules, as presented, seemed a bit over complicated. When we played we later worked out that any one of us could have won the game during the last round, despite a large seeming gap in the scores - that's a big plus for me

Has a strong family game feeling in it. The gameplay was ok, but just too random in many parts. Everything can be ruined or gained with a lucky draw. Didn't really see the point here. 
We played that the "huts" or fruits or whatever were scored 3-6-9 instead of 5-10-15 and that worked really well. Endgame scoring showed how that would've mixed the scoring just too much.

I was always the guy to roll the dice. With being the one it's sometimes hard to get out from rolling the die once started. Bleh.

Too random, too family, too boring... not for me.

Neat discovery game. It is a little luck dependant, but you can win by good play anyway. Note, this game dictates the colors you have to use if playing with fewer players as it does not come with the same amount of pieces in all colors.

Let's talk shop.

Good things:  A nice, big board. (I like that kinda stuff)
              Excellent art on the tiles.
              Does satisfy some of the exploration itch.
              Deep thought on simple mechanics.  A 'simple' facade to a rather complex game.

Bad things:   Tiki huts - way too powerful in the scoring, and far too random to be as such.  Trivializes the exploration.
              Rules confusion.  Lots of grey areas that have to be discussed and agreed upon. (so far)
              Small point track.  Only goes to 50, but the board is massive, and scores WILL go beyond 50.  Poor use of design here.
              Silly bag.  You get a real nice cloth bag that's only for drawing tiki rewards?  Seems a bit..over the top.
              Setup.  It will take a while, and although it's not that big of a deal to me, it will be a deal to some folks.
              2-player game.  I got stuck rolling the dice almost every round.  That blows.  I calculated that my opponent had one scout on the tiki track for every dice that I rolled.  Rough.  I paid for those.  That mechanic needs to be smoothed out for 2-player games.  Otherwise, it'd be OK for 3 or more.

Update:  A good game here, but only with the following house rules for 2 player games.

1)  When one person rolls for money, the opponent gets equal to the amount rolled.  The opponent only gets  1 gold when the player rolls the navigation symbol.  Like before, the player chooses a number (1-6) and THEN the opponent gets 1 extra gold.

2)  Tiki Huts ..... 5 = 3,  10 = 6, 15 = 9

If the other players merely follow suit they will probably not get ahead.

I was really underwhelmed with Entdecker. The concept and mechanics were fine, but it took forever plus four years to start playing for the first time, and the game gradually slowed down as turns got shorter and shorter. My group eventually abandoned it after a few hours, as no one seemed to be having a whole lot of fun. Another problem is that one player took a huge lead early on, and while it would have balanced out towards the end as the islands were completed, we simply didn't have the interest to bear another half-hour.

The scoring system allows for some surprises at the end of the game. In my first game, I came in third after being in the lead for most of the game!

Entdecker is a worthy game, one of the three games that came out of Teuber's grand exploration design. But I do like the other two games of the trilogy better: Settlers of Catan, and Lowenherz.

Surprisingly good game with a feel that you are actually exploring. Some weird situations may arise. Money is extremely tight and getting lucky in a right moment certainly helps you.

An ok choice if you love exploration games, but the gameplay is pretty dated.  A lot of random screwage in the tile draws - I prefer exploration games where the tiles are more equal in value, just different choices to make.  The way income is generated is pretty stupid - you can fall in a trap where you are the one rolling for income every round and the other players are getting a 1 coin benefit over you and you basically have to lose a turn to get out of it. Unlike Carcassonne where you can get significant points for smaller areas, almost all the island points in Entdecker will come from the 3 big islands that are formed around the +5 and +10 tiles (although note I've only played with the recommended setup - random might be better); it's like if Carcassonne only gave you points for farms (the guys laid flat in fields).  The pawn path to compete for the hidden point tokens is a very non-thematic boring way to get points.  Lastly, the tiles are not that diverse - they do not come close to including all the possible island/shipping path shapes like Carcassonne does.  In summary, Carcassonne is just better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I am loving this game.  Not only does the game look fantastic at the end...  it enthralls as you watch it come together.  So many options are available to the players, wether its fighting over the big points islands, or populating the board with explorers (that will eventually end up in the villages), a player is never really out of the running.  I really enjoy drawing the tiles and the suspense present as you flip it over...  especially the event tiles... 

Top notch.  One of my favorite games after 2 plays.

Like, Carcassonne, Entdecker involves laying tiles to complete a map. However, layers of depth are added by giving you the option to buy specific tiles. I also like the aspect of native interaction. Maybe it's not quite as good as Settlers, but it's a solid game that's lots of fun.

Two games in one. The first one, played in the main part of the board, is about exploration, area control, blocking other players and forming majorities.

Entdecker - Exploring New Horizons -- Both this version and the original are great.  This is one game where I've decided to own both versions.  

In this version, the chips in the huts have values which I think make luck overpower strategy.  I recommend changing those values from 5, 10, & 15 to lower values (3, 6, & 9; or 3, 5, & 7; even 3, 4, & 5).  This still allows some luck, but the chips no longer render strategy ineffective.

I've always particularly enjoyed the Entdecker game engine.  My only real complaint has been that games last too long. (A game of such middling depth does not warrant such a long duration.)  

Regardless, I love the sense of discovery these games provide.

Carcassonne made more complex is one way of looking at this game. I thought it was a reasonable mid length game, good for the occasional outing. Careful strategic balance of money versus development and placing of scouts to control the end game is key.

I had this for over a year before I played it.  It lingered, gathering dust, lonely and unused.  It just seemed there were better games to play.  Finally, I twisted arms and got this on the table.  After comments like "Let's get this going quick so we can get to the good games" everyone became engrossed.  We were in deep.  The money was tight, and there was a passing of the torch to try and get other people to have to roll for doubloons.  Great balance between pushing risks and spending for the sure thing.  The toll system is great for strategic play and laying tile to manipulate your guys to get onto other islands make whatever might be clever about Carcassone obsolete.  This will stand as one of the best exploration games.  Many deep choices in how to score islands vs getting your guys on the huts.  Highly recommended.  Don't let it linger.

Pretty damned fun.  Played this with three last night, and there are a lot of great interactions in this one.  When we started the game, it seemed a better solution was to plunk down the settlement or a fort on a space to get the most influence on the island, but in the later stages of the game, it became quite apparent that the scouts serve a very valuable purpose by allowing players to get into the villages.  All in all, it was a pretty tight game, and fun as well.

I played a two-player game that took forever (we didn&#039;t even finish) and, like most tile-laying games, did not enjoy it.  Some of the best games are great because they slowly unfold and evolve, but the turns in this one are repetitive.  I realize I&#039;m in the minority here, but I find it very boring.

Carcassonne on steroids? Nicely produced and tactically intricate. Mrs Sorp prefers Carcassonne. For 2 player the money rule needs to be adapted, we play that they non rolling player only gets 1 extra gold on an even roll. 3/4 players much better game than 2.

One could describe this as "Carcassonne with boats" but that would be over simplifing it, there are many more choices, including being able to pick the tile you need at a given time, provided you are willing (and able) to pay the price.

RATING: 7.5
[Mayfair 2001 edition] {Exploration, nautical; dice-rolling, tile-laying, area-control; optimal 4p}  Entdecker is a very nice family game.  It is thematic and fun. It has good player interaction, in which players have to compete for island influence and produce token.  There is luck in this game, but it is thematically sound and can be managed easily.  I don't think any qualified gamers will find the dice rolls or tile draw a problem in this game.  Overall, it is a decent game for around 90 minutes.

A minor problem is that the score spectrum for the produce token is too large.  Players who are not proficient in guessing hidden value from players' behaviors and impression may miss the chance to get high score.

Play as designed, with the normal hut rules. Really good and fun game that combines tile-laying exploration with two kinds of area control (islands and huts). I really like the gold die mechanism, as it puts control in the players' hands instead of the game's.

I've played Entdecker once with two players. It was fun, albeit a bit random for my tastes overall. I enjoyed the exploration elements. The struggle for islands was tense. Although I had heard negative comments about the huts, I found them to be a worthy addition, and another element that both players needed to keep in mind at all times. Perhaps the huts are a bit overvalued when compared with island scoring. In the end, I find the game to play sort of like an advanced Carcassonne. That's a complement. I suspect I will enjoy the two-player game the most, but would like to try with four just to compare.

A fairly basic tile laying/area control game. Has good, well supported theme and interesting mechanics, but at it's heart it's a rather light & luck-based game, takes way too long for what it is and quickly starts to suffer from general dryness and repetition.

Interesting tile-laying game that has some similarities with Carcassonne, but adds an interesting mechanic of paying gold for tiles and restricts where you can place those tiles by moving a boat around to "discover" the new territory.  While certainly not Klaus Teuber's best game, it's very enjoyable.  I just wish they included enough playing pieces to choose any color you want.  I don't like when games like this one (as well as Metro and Australia) restrict your color choice based on the number of players.

Played once, as two player game. There is plenty of good mechanics here but, something just didn't connect for me.
Really wanted to like it more than I did. Tried again with more players and it did seem better, if alittle underwhelming. Upon request from another player, we tried this again and it seemed fine. Could my slow change of heart be that I've won it all the times I've played it? OK, Maybe...Just have to mention that Kosmos delivers another great set of components. Those people know how to present a game!

Initial impression: I killed my opponents at this game, and I don't quite understand how.  I'm not sure if it was bad luck on their part, or whether I just had the best strategy.

As I understand it, Klaus originally envisioned this to be the first third of a colossal Catan game.  It would have fit well in such a game, but seems weak when by itself.

Enjoyable light game that has plenty of randomness, but also enough decisions to make it interesting.  I've only played it once and have some concerns about the strategy becoming stale in multiple plays, but that could be unfounded.  I enjoy the tile laying aspect, particularly given the limited tile selection.  The spacial aspect is good, as it saves it from being just another area control game.

Players compete to discover and claim the largest islands in this very fine exploration game.  The exploration is done by adding tiles to a mostly empty board, always with the requirement that land edges or water edges of the tiles must match.  Players may place scouts, forts, and settlements onto newly discovered land, and when an entire island is discovered players earn points according to the strength of their claim on the island.  There are bonuses for islands with waterfalls and for controlling natural resources.

RATING: 7
Many games of this under my belt. This game is great in that the board changes every time because of the exploration tiles. I have become a bit bored and disenchanted with the native huts though and they seem to make the game rather static again. So even though the exploration aspect of the game keeps the map fresh every time the huts make the game seem the same every time... if that makes any sense. I will play it when suggested though and it is always tense and close. Fun overall.

RATING: 5.5
Very pretty, and could be a good game as well with some fixes.  There are too many points at stake in the hut mechanic, so as to render the rest of the game nearly irrelevant.

Hmmmm.... had a go with the 'Professor Easy' introductory rules... not impressed with the game (seems to be missing something).  Will try again... rating may change with more play.
Although supposedly about exploring the 'New World', the theme in no way corresponds to the extremely abstract rules. Laurel and I were very disappointed with this game, but it looked so good that we didn't want to sell or trade it. As a result we decided to re-write the rules. We've now played the game twice with the new rules-set and think we've improved it immensely from the original.

RATING: 6.5
As far as exploration themed games go, I've found Entdecker to be a lot more fun to play than Lost Valley or Goldland.  The familiar Carcassonne-styled of claiming majority of an island is certainly a plus as well, especially with a more relaxed scoring rule (being able to snatch half of the points with just one scout, what a bargain).

However, I'm not too fond of how income is given and distributed.  It seem to run into the rich getting richer problem.  Basically whoever is the first to have to roll the dice, will very likely being doing that for the rest of the game.  It is hard to be able to build up your asset once you find yourself in a financial hole.  In my opinion, all other players should receive a reduced share of the coins to prevent this from happening.

Furthermore, I'm very ambivalent on the native hut scoring.  On the one hand, I like having it because scouts now serve a dual purpose.  You can't solely use them as cannon fodders to compete for highest influence on the main board, because only one of your pieces gets to be sent off after a given island is completed.  Therefore, the more you put on the same place, the less presence you have to contest for the native bonuses.  On the other, I don't care for how random these points are, so much so that it can propel someone who hasn't done well to a higher position and possibly even the win.

A good game with a fun mix of mechanics.  A variant or two to correct the aforementioned problems will likely increase your enjoyment of it.

Exploration creates the map anew each game, and you gamble in choosing whether to establish your presence on an island now, or continue exploring.  The battle for the produce (ignoring the illogic of all islands' scouts going for the same goods, or perhaps just thinking of it as metaphorical ;^) is often strange and suspenseful.

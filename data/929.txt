RATING: 8
Have played the public domain version a ton and my rating is for that.
Have just got the published version which is different (80 cards, not 52, no doubt works much better with larger numbers) and will rate that when played.

Finally played it and on a guys weekend away (in Valencia) it was awesome fun.  6 of us played it - a lot.  I really like how the card distribution makes it a more variable game and great for a larger number of players.

Fairly simple to play, it's hard to get back to the top when you're at the bottom (The Greater Peon especially), but it is possible.
More fun if you include silly hats, and dances and if everyone is a good sport.

Years ago I was part of a card-game group that just played Hearts. I realized at the time I was bored of the game, but played for the social aspects of it. Nobody else said anything like what I was thinking, but it was clear later that they were thinking the same. On a whim I got Great Dalmuti from a local game shop, but lacked enough people to play it. I brought it to one of our Hearts nights (also on a whim). About 9:30PM everyone was calling it quits on hearts. I asked "can we please try this new game I have? Just one round. I want to see how it plays." Everyone moaned and grudgingly agreed. We didn't knock off playing until 2AM that night. Dalmuti was just that much different and fun and competitive.

I gave this an 8 rating only because the Dilbert card game came along later and it's that much more addicting. The Great Dalmuti has gone in and out of print over the years. Get a copy if you can.

Traded a garage sale find (Lego Racers) for this one. Ah scum... what drinking fun you are. I don't know why anyone would want to play this outside of a situation involving alcohol. The booze is what makes this good... just like "Drinking Jenga".

UPDATE: traded for Verrater (after realizing that a deck of cards works just as well, and that I'd rather be playing Kings or "Drinking Life" anyway.

Like many card games, it's fine by me - but not great. I think there is a bit of strategy in play and the humor of the game definitely carries it along in the right crowd. But I can take it or leave it in the end. It's a good kids/group game - so I'll hang on to it a bit longer because of that.

A decent game to fill any spare time but feels insignificant.

2016-03-23
The Great Dalmuti is an endless game that can be played as long as you wish. A single round does not last too long but it affects the next one. So you can just keep on playing.

When it comes to the game mechanics, The Great Dalmuti borrows its ideas from the myriad of shedding/trick taking games. So nothing special there. Actually the idea for inherited player roles for the next round is exactly the same as in Daifugō (大富豪), which can be played with a regular deck of 52 cards.

During a round, the tactical decisions are significant. However, since the greatest fun is in the inheriting roles, The Great Dalmuti makes a better past time activity than a game for single round fun.

RATING: 9
I have playing this game for nearly 20 years, and have introduced it to many, many people who all love it.  I understand it is similar to a game called "Asshole," although I have never played it.  It is a simple card game of "world domination" that even children as young as 7 can pick up (and unfortunately beat you!).  I personally own four decks, including two German decks (the game play is the same, it's just that the cards have the German name on the backs on them).  Great for big groups up to 10.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Card game that is best for large parties. playing wiht 4 or less tends to keep the same players in the same roles for long periods of time which can be frustrating. Also tends to wear out its welcome after a while.

RATING: 7
Good party game, especially if the higher ups start ordering the peons around!

RATING: 6.5
Good game, better than Shithead/Presidents by a significant margin. The ratings on BGG are generally unfair - How come when someone like Peter Sarrett remakes a public domain game he is lauded with praise, but all Richard Garfield gets is scorn?
The game is fantastic with several people and a bunch of beers, pet names for the cards and rowdy table talk. Not for the po-faced thinkers amongst us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A sort of gamers president/asshole. The great Dalmuti is a fun light card game with no real defined ending... Unless you count being too drunk to keep playing as an ending.

This is a fairly random game.  It can be fun in the right circumstances.  This is a game to have fun with the people you are playing with.  It is not a game to have fun because of the virtues of the game itself.

It's one of those games that is almost a crime that it is sold as a product. It is essentially three decks of cards with a bunch not used.

RATING: 4
+ The un-even-ness of the seating makes it so that you really want to work hard to move up in status, even if just by one chair.
- This really isn't as much of a game as it is a social reshuffling of chairs; Not too many in-game decisions to make.


Why it's previously-owned:
This one was never going to get played again.  With gaming time at a premium, there's always something we'd rather play than this.
I donated my copy of the game to Goodwill.

Suffers from what I call the "Werewolf Problem" -- games going on and on since there is no proper endpoint.  I find "Dilbert: Corporate shuffle," a re-themed Great Dalmuti, to be a bit more interesting because of the special cards.

RATING: 7
A nice light game that can be loads of fun with a sarcastic, slightly demented group.  The optional rules where the Dalmuties can force the peons to do various tasks (like serve drinks, sit on the floor, wear a motorcycle helmet, etc.) is a must.

RATING: 5.5
As a ladder card game, this is one of the kingpins.  Game play can be fun and frustrating all at once.  Games run the risk of becoming more experience than games, but that is par for the territory.  As a casual card game, it won't disappoint.  There is room for smart play, but you still have to deal with the cards dealt and with the surrender of 'good cards' for bad ones.  Not sure of its long term appeal for gamers over their lifetime, but it will likely make a solid appearance in many gamers in formative years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Very similar to the game I know as "SCUM" although the card distribution is quite different. Playing high > low took a change in thought process as did being able to play duplicates.
Certainly not a game for serious consideration, but for something to do while waiting for stragglers, or to close out an evening it should work fine.

I haven't played this in years.  I remember it being kind of fun and silly, but it apparently wasn't fun enough to make our group excited to play it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Every time I have played this I had the same experience:

My turn: I can do nothing, Pass.
Next turn: I can do nothing. Pass.
Next turn: I can play one or two cards.
Next turn: I can do nothing. Pass.
Ad infinitum.

The worst part is if you end up in last place, you must give your two best cards to the person who won the last round, then they give you any two cards from their hand. This means you are even less likely to be able to play anything on your turn.

Other people seem to enjoy it, but I've never had a good game. It's so bad that I chose to drop from a multi-game tournament where I was second rather than play this for the final round.

Game play is a lot like Scum, President, or Kings-Queens-Peasants-and-Peons ......... whatever you call it in your home.  That game of itself is a lot of fun, but The Great Dalmuti adds an extra level to the game.  High numbered (low-powered) cards almost have a special power because it is easy to have a large set of them, which is hard to beat with the low numbered (high powered) cards because there just are not as many (the number of the card also determines the number of that type of card in the deck).  This also increasing the criticality of deciding when to play the high powered cards.  Fun game.

One of the games I despise the most: every game that forces you to stand up, leave your place and swap seats is at best disagreeable. The rank system with its related privileges/drawbacks makes for a good source of taunting though and thus keeps Dalmuti off an even lower rating.

The discovery of Tichu has taken away some of my love for this game, but it's still great fun in the right situations.  Those situations being groups of 5-7 people who want light, fun card games.

RATING: 1
The Great Dalmuti has the potential to be fun, but suffers from several major flaws.

 Luck is too much of a factor in Dalmuti because a bad draw can wreck your position and make it difficult to come back. You will likely be forced to watch in frustration as the winners keep taking your best cards. Additionally, seating order is a huge part of this game, and you will be stuck in a bad seating position.

 Secondly, Dalmuti lasts longer than necessary because of a poorly defined end condition.The game lasts for an indeterminate number of rounds, and players can theoretically end the game after a round is over. However, this rarely happens in practice because getting a majority of people to agree to quit is difficult. Additionally, ending the game is seen as unfair to the people who won the previous round and cannot enjoy the fruits of their victory.

 Finally, Dalmuti encourages bullying the losers with outside penalties For example, the  rules explicitly suggest forcing losing players to sit in uncomfortable seats or wear silly hats.


Bang:The Dice Game, Tichu, or Telestrations are much better options because they are simple, work with large groups, and fit large groups of people while having a well-defined end condition.

Not only was this the most mindless and boring game I have ever played, it is the first game that has made me want to go out and get in a fight after wasting 1 1/2 hours of my life. I think I would rather repeatedly slam my forehead into a brick wall with bits of broken glass glued to it than play this one again.

I thought that maybe it was because I wasn't drinking, but I think this would take the fun out of drinking.

below average game in the trick-taking genre.  you just get cards and play them out in boring fashion.  not enough ways to play your cards (no straights or full houses).  you are very much at the mercy of your cards (and your opponents cards)... so you hope that if you are not leading that someone nearby on your right is leading... that way you can ditch your crappy high cards sooner.  I abhor the fluffy rules like "peon must play from under the table".  WARNING: the low number cards are better which is a little tough for newbies and non-gamers to grasp... but the logic is good to have the number on the card represent how many of that card exist in the deck (i.e. 4 fours and 12 twelves).

This is a game that everyone should own.  It's fun.  It accomodates almost any number of players (as long as you have at least 5).  It's easy to learn.  You can play as long (or as short) as you like.  It's inexpensive.

We use the Great Dalmuti as a way to get people warmed up on Game Night.  Our Game Nights are an excuse to spend time with friends, most of whom are not gamers.  The Great Dalmuti allows everyone to play, and gets people around the table, so we can then break out other games.  It is perfect in this role.

I was listening to the Dice Tower's best bang for your buck episode and heard this game mentioned. Then the same day I was at Goodwill and found the German version for $1.99 and picked it up!

This is a very solid, simple card game similar to the traditional game Presidents. I like the twist of having the better cards become rarer and rarer...it adds a nice flavor to the game.

Overall I think a round felt a little too short. I could see how playing this with more people and playing 10-15 rounds would be where this game would shine the best. And with beer. This would definitely be a good beer and pretzels game to play with people who don't play modern board games

Good and quick card game by Richard Garfield. You have probably already played it in some other form during your life. :) Also, it stimulates some kind of role-playing, expecially when nobles start to insult the poor peasants.

We refer to this as "The Game that Never Ends".  At least the rules we have don't mention a method of scoring.  I've read the scoring rules and they sound like they're cobbled into the game.

RATING: 8
The ideal light-weight card game to play at a beergarden: Mixes well with larger rounds (6-7 players are best), alcohol (helping people to roleplay) and adding/removing players on the fly. 

Otherwise, it is simply a poor man's version of the classic "Tichu". The fun depends largely on the participating players willingness to roleplay along. However, I would always prefer "Citadels" in less alcoholic environments which offer a proper playing table. 

SENSIBLE HOUSE RULES:
* You can go along with the current trick, i.e. play cards of the same rank as are on the table.
* Once you have passed, you must continue to pass until the next trick starts.
* There's no card exchange in the very first round.

RATING: 6
Okay, listen. This isn't REALLY a game. This is a vehicle for roleplaying, and on that front it can absolutely deliver. If you've got a large group and a willingness, nay, BURNING DESIRE to order each other around, laugh at each other's misfortunes, and thrill as you climb your way to the top then this is a wholly worthwhile way to spend an evening.

Crazy fun, with the right people.  I enjoy the game for what it is, and would not like it very much if the Great Dalmuti and Lesser Dalmuti actually abused or mistreated the two peons.  Make the lesser Peon sweep the cards and shuffle, and I think that is enough.  I would not play with a more "abusive" type of person.

Also, minimum 7 players.

Rated 6 after one play. I gotta admit, this was pretty fun. Although technically there's no scoring, we added up everyone's rank after 8 hands. It plays like most other trick taking or "get rid of your hand" card games, but the ranking system from Great Dalmuti to Greater Peon feels different. It's also odd to play a game that mildly punishes the weakest via a "taxation" of better cards from their hands.

If I had known about this game in my college days, this would have been a blast. As it stands, it was fun, but I'm not sure how frequently I'll play it.

I picked this up really cheaply because I used to play the card game it's based off (which we knew as Scumbag) almost every day in high school. This game was a way of life for us!

The lower numbered cards being the higher value seems a bit counter-intuitive in play.

Really great game. We've added some wacky, random hats to our game collection specifically to use with this game. I love how the cards are organized so that the lower rungs of society have some hope of clawing their way to middle-class-dom.

'Life isn't fair, so why should a cardgame be', an acquaintance of mine always snickers with an Evil Glint in her eyes when she brings up this game. I had the opportunity to participate in a few hands the other day, and while it has some clever mechanics and at times mildly interesting psychological-tactical play, it fell flat after about an hour. Simply put, there is no variety whatsoever: all the fun has to come from the participants acting 'in character' and setting their own victory conditions. If you remain level-headed and just play aimlessly, the game breaks down. The rating reflects this: with the right group this can be a corker, but with the wrong group you are well advised to chose something else. I loathe 'forced humor', so I have no intention of playing this again.

Get rid of your cards first to be crowned the king or risk having to wear the dreaded jesters cap. Naturally I had to pimp this game up with the right head gear. A crown for the king , a high military hat for the general , a popes hat for the bishop and a jesters cap with bells hanging from the tips. Everybody enjoys poking fun at the loser/jester sitting to the right of the king and who has to endure the ridicule of being called the fool.

The Great Dalmuti is a nice cardgame - especially when some roleplaying is added to the game. However, it's just a good-looking variant to a cardgame that is played using an ordinairy card-deck. (called Lullen in NL)

Solely based on gameplay, I'd rate it a "6,5". However, rulewise this game has copied too much from another game.

The game doesn't have to have a set number of turns, but you canplay until done. If someone is a poor card player, then they'll get stuck at greater peon for several turns and this can be a drag. Be sensitve to that and understand a card counter has a big advantage in this game. If all are counting cards, then the game becomes very cut-throat and a hoot to play.

One of the best games I'm aware of that suit for large number of players, especialy if everyone has the right amouth of humor in them. Great fun for those in good position and a nice challenge for those in not so good position. Also the theoreticly unlimited playtime allows the game to  be played as a quick filler or a full length marathon.

RATING: 8
Simple game with some room for strategy but that's not what it's about. I would categorize this as a party game rather then a card game since there really is no winner and the fact that you get up and rearrange yourselves after each game means it can not be taken too seriously. It is best played with 5 or more but will work with 4. There are 80 cards numbered 1 through 12 and 2 jokers. The number on the card also tells you how many of the card are in the game. One 1, eight 8s etc. All players sit according to the rank they achieved in the previous game and the 2 bottom players are penalized by having to give up their best cards to the 2 top players. The Great Dalmuti, having earned that title by coming in first in the previous game, gets to go first and lays down sets or singles of any card he wants. The next player has to lay down the same quantity of a lower number or pass. This goes around the table until everyone has passed and then the player who laid down the last set gets to lead off the next round with any set he chooses to play. Whomever empties his or her hand first is the Great Dalmuti in the next game and play continues until only one player is left. Players then rearrange themselves according to how they finished, the cards are shuffled, dealt and it all starts again. All kinds of abuse is heaped on the Greater Peon (the last player) from having to shuffle and deal to getting drinks for the Great Dalmuti. We have even made the GP sit under the table and play a couple of times. If someone gets stuck as the GP for a long time it can be a drag but most of the time everyone moves around a lot. Highly recommended for large groups.

This is an excellent filler game. It's a very simple ladder card game with great strategies revolving around the higher valued cards being less and less common in the deck. It also has some aspects of the card game President in that the last place players give up some of their cards to the top place players. And the game can easily play more than the 8 players listed on the box. But when I said it's an excellent filler, that's all it is. It should not be a substitute for a real game. After multiple plays of this in rapid succession, it does get dull and boring. But for fillers and short time frames, it is excellent.

Idea:
Try to get rid of your cards to be the Great Dalmuti on next deal.

Mechanism:
Deck consists of 1 of 1s, 2 of 2s,.. and 12 of 12's and two jokers. Play set of numbers like 4 of 12s and each player may then play same number of smaller cards or pass. One who plays last gets to play first on empty table. Those who ended up high on last game get to give bad cards to those who ended on bottom who give best cards in exchange. Going up is harder than staying up.

To whom:
Works from 4+ plrs, easy to learn and fun to play with casual players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The meat of the game is really simple, to a point were it's almost boring. This situation can be rescued by the fact that players are encouraged to be mean to each other and treat others like inferior subjects. Changes to the hierarchy can than lead to entertaining situations. But if the players don't buy into this, the game becomes really boring.

[2 plays--was that really all?  It seemed like more...] I am dropping my rating of this to a 1, not merely because it's deeply tedious and I hate it, but because I contend that it does not fit the definition of a game, as it has no victory condition.  I suppose this is an activity of sorts, but not a game.  I understand this is a commercialized version of a popular drinking "game," and presumably in the original you play until everyone is too drunk to play any more or to care.  But without the drinking element, it just goes on and on, eternally and pointlessly, until finally the group gets bored and agrees to let it stop.  The one nice thing I can say for this exercise in pointlessness is that the art on the cards is really cool.  But please don't make me do this again.

RATING: 7
A commercial variation of President/Chairman (which can be played with a regular deck), with a pyramid of cards.  Decent card game filler for small groups of up to 8.  Because there's no winner, it's quite relaxed, and players can come and go mid-game.  Role-playing makes it more fun, since it's more a social or party game than a strategy game: Give the Greater Dalmuti the best chair, the Greater Peon the floor or standing, and maybe even hats or some other symbol of power as a sign of entitlement.  [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/304514]Always wear hats![/url] The Greater Dalmuti should also dictate the round.  I found with 8 players it lacked control, it might be best with 6-7.    Frank's Zoo is another commercial President variant to try.

Essentially a "special edition" of the classic card game "Asshole", Great Dalmuti is a definitely one of those games that benefits from large groups of people and a jovial, party atmosphere (alcohol helps too).  I've never played a completely boring or regrettable game of Dalmuti, and while there isn't a lot to the game (though that's not to say their isn't any strategy to it), its a game that one plays for the company they are in, and the overall experience of it, not the game itself or its mechanics.  If you are a fan of Asshole, or similar card games, I recommend giving this one a try, though for best results, you are going to need at least six players.

The Great Dalmuti falls strictly in the card party game category, and is one of those games where the rules themselves tell you that no one really ever wins or loses unless you use a variant to assign points. My kids enjoy playing it, especially since we assign silly hats to the people in the highest two and lowest two positions around the table. It's a good way to introduce kids to ladder/climbing card games - I see Tichu in our not-too-distant future. But I can't really take this game too seriously.

I learned this game in the late 80's using standard 52-card decks. (Depending on the number of players we might use 2 or 3 decks at a time.) The triangular card distribution used in the Great Dalmuti proprietary deck seems to work a little better when there are fewer than, say, 7 players.

In Spain there is a classical card game (using spanish deck) called: "Los esclavos" (the slaves) that is older than The Great Dalmuti.

Fun trick-taking filler that is not to be taken seriously. Bears some resemblance to Tichu and Frank's Zoo but is quite a bit less susceptible to strategic play. If you want a deeper game check out one of those instead. Dalmuti also has sort of a run-away leader problem. Here it's by design and fully intentional, though. The more the merrier.

After 2.5 yrs from purchase I finally play this, and with 7 players its a lot of fun.  The card manipulation to get the lead requires a bit of thinking, and general good card play is required. The basic unfairness is also a great excuse for laughs, especially as you go from top to bottom. Not sure it would be as good with 6 or less or even 8, but as a game for 7 people, a definitely 8 (Aug 2013).

Act pompous as the Dalmuti, and obedient as the peon.  We always make the peon fetch the beer and chips, and often we make him/her stand.  If playing with more than 6, tax the lowest merchant (the used chariot dealer) a random pick from his hand, in return for whatever card the top merchant (the banker) wants to give him.  Don't even think about scoring, play until you get tired.

Siempre quise tener un Dalmuti. No por la mecanica del juego que es muy sencilla y acaba aburriendo al poco tiempo, si no por el transfondo del dalmuti. En nuestras partidas nos convertimos de verdad en una sociedad feudal y los peones lo pasan "verdaderamente mal", motivo por el cual cuando llegan al poder se desquitan.

Very similar to a card game that you can play with a deck of playing cards that may be known as Master-Slave, Scum, etc...Distribution of cards is different, but not much else in this game.  Okay for a group game for a short time, but quickly wears out its welcome after a few plays.

The proprietary deck (with one 1, two 2s, three 3s, etc.) makes this a much better game than the public domain President, Asshole, or other variations. Simply put, the fact that the lesser cards are more numerous creates greater opportunities for interesting hands. And creating interesting hands is the whole point (attempts to add a scoring system to these sorts of games always fall short).

What a fabulous game!  Especially for a large, mixed group -- you really need at least 7 for this one to be good.  It's excellent for people who don't know each other.  It's not too hard and has a snappy pace.  We let the Great Dalmuti dedicate each round, have some great hats that the Greaters and Lessers are forced to wear, and always give the wooden stool to the Greater Peon and the comfy chair to the Great Dalmuti.  You even get some exercise when you switch seats between rounds.  One of my favorites.

RATING: 6.5
I've always had fun playing this quick card game.  This is a highly luck dependent game where the rich get richer, but that's OK with me because there will be a new hand in a few minutes which might elevate your position.  It stinks to be stuck in the peon seat for several hands, but it feels like an accomplishment when you can work your way up from peon to dalmuti with the right cards and good play.

Great fun when played as a silly party game with lots of role-playing.  You can go from being the most wretched, fawning peon possible, then, as your luck changes, lording it over everyone all uber-patrician style.  The game itself is a mutant strain of Chinese climbing games, reminiscent of [i]Big Two[/i], et al.*, where the goal is to play all your cards and "go out" first.  But really, that mechanism takes a distant back seat to the social position shenannigans.  I think the "game" would suck without them.  Rating reflects play with silly-sports.

GOLDEN WIFE-QUOTE:  [said with a disturbing case of crazy-eye] "I don't want to play [i]Dalmuti[/i]—I want to play a game where I can [i]win[/i]."

(It must be said that when we do play she spends an inordinate amount of time in the Dalmuti seat; she was just out for blood that night.)

A wonderfully evil party game. We call it "The Unfair Game" because all the rules favor those on the top and punish those on the bottom. Which is why it is fun. Rounds are pretty short, so players are constantly moving up and down the hierarchy. Clawing your way out of the depths to rise to prominence. Sitting at the top and watching your friends and family suffer in the depths. The quick rounds mean people can easily drop in and out. Perfect in large group situations. Works just fine with up to 12.Simple, but you do make decisions that matter. And it is WAAAAAAAAAY better with silly hats.

The Great Dalmuti provides simple rules and is an easy-to-be-learned game. The most attractive point of the game is the theme. The game shows medieval ages. Players ought to perform each classes of medieval social levels. While playing the game, players meet some sociological interactions. Once you play as a upper class in the game, you may feel that you don't want to change the social system no matter how evil it is. The Great Dalmuti is more than a game. This game is like sociology aids for me.

I bought this sometime around 1996-1997. It's my favorite party game. Many hours of my life have been spent playing it. The rules are simple, so I've introduced many, many non-gamers to it and everyone loves it. While plenty of public-domain variants exist using the standard deck of cards, this version's card distribution lends itself well to thoughtful play. Also, it's definitely more fun once you start introducing silly hats and comfy chairs.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (December 2011)

First time we played it, I made a big rules mistake so It was a regular game, that time I rated a 6.0.  With the correct group (and correct set of rules) this can be a blast. You have to role-play a little for the game to be enjoyable. I love climbing games so I like this game. I still prefer to play more “serious” games like Haggis but from time to time I do like to play this game.

The game has simple rules, perfect for family and non-gamers. Another plus, it can accommodate a large group of players.

I’m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings with the BGG recommendation rating system.

Current Rating: 6.0

My desire to play The Great Dalmuti is very low, so I’m downgrading its rating once more. I just got rid of my copy of the game. The game is way too simple for us, perhaps is it a good family game.

RATING: 5
This is a drinking game when played with a standard deck (most often) and more of a thinking game when played with the Dalmuti version due to the card distribution.

If playing the standard deck version though, be sure to ask about "house rules" or "local variants" that include such things as 'doubles on singles', 'red threes being wild', 'socials' and if someone has been president for 3 rounds getting to make a "rule" or not.

Also note that if you are drinking water or soda and everyone else is drinking alcohol, don't bother playing.  You'll just get upset when people act drunk and can't do a simple thing like know when it's their turn.

RATING: 7
Simple card game where the different roles depending on your position are the most fun. Better with more people (6+).

RATING: 9
Requires a certain amount of silliness to play properly.  You *must* do appropriate seating- which means for us, the Greater Dalmuti gets the entire sofa to themselves along with all the pillows in the house, Lesser Dalmuti a nice chair, highest Merchant a nice office chair, the rest of the Merchants whatever chairs are normally around the dining room table, Lesser Peon a suitcase or cheap folding chair, and Greater Peon gets an upturned bucket or whatever else in the house almost doesn't pass as a seat.  Something worth trying is Really Great Dalmuti with 2 decks, 16 players, and 4 levels of Dalmuti/Peon (Greatest, Greater, Lesser, Least).

This game is essentially played the exact same as the Asshole/President drinking game that uses a standard 52 card, 4 suit deck, except this game's deck has one 1, two 2s, three 3s, etc... up to twelve 12s and no suits.  This deck of cards is a very nice substitute for a standard deck.

Make no mistake - this is a drinking game.  It's not very much fun when you are sober.

There is something amazingly cruel about how fun this game is... and how depending on the people you play with can just be a riot or really annoying.

The gameplay elements change depending on your seat at the table. If you are low ranked your goal should be to move up to the next slot rather than go all the way to the top in one round.

A lot of the strategy though is counting the cards that have been played and deciding when to make your move. Being dealt a great hand though usually trumps all other aspects of the game though.

Just like Asshole, only a little bit more involved. Fun times for a light card game. This is one of the best games for hand management that you can find.

A good game, but it doesn't have any deepness or strategy in it, most of the times it's about luck. On the good side, it's OK if you're hanging out with your friends having some beers.

The game grows greater when the number of players is greater. I've played it several times with 8 players and it's one of the greatest games I've played with that amount of people, but after 2 games in a row (8 players, 8 round of playes, points for each game) it grows old and the fun is almost gone. That's when I suggest to split the party into 2 different games...

Pardon the vernacular, but for those of us who know; anyone who has played the drinking game asshole has played something much akin to this game. The only difference being that there are 12 suits (numbered one thru 12) rather than 4. The number of the suit relating the quanitiy of that card in the deck. A basic game with a mild amount of strategy. Luck wins out the day for the most part, but its a fun romp with a group of friends, that doesn't try to take itself to seriously, as you do not keep score.

Meh. The accompanying mockery is the only distinctive thing about this ladder game. Well, the mockery and the deliberate balance-shifting. This version is better at shaking up the player ranks than is just playing with a standard deck of cards. I enjoyed this in high school; I won't mind if I never play it again.

I played a shitload of Dalmuti back in college, generally with the same tight game group (and occasionally as a drinking game). It's social in a lot of the same ways as Werewolf, and it really benefits from buy-in on the part of everyone playing -- finding different chairs, having silly hats, getting into ordering around the peons, etc.

Playing with the same group consistently causes a fabulous metagame to develop over time, and this is one of the best things about Dalmuti. That and how fun it is to get people's blood boiling.

Nice to pull out in a mixed crowd of gamers and non-gamers, or as an opener before you split into smaller groups over meatier games. Very flexible, people may join and leave the game as they please. Probably more interesting as a game if you decide a number of rounds to be played.

Exactly like presidents and assholes (P&A), only much worse. I played P&A many, many times in college and have grown to really enjoy that game and all of the house rules that go along with it depending on where you play (or what you are drinking). The Great Dalmuti tries to copy that game with some minor modifications and a different card distribution. While playing I kept thinking to myself that I wish we would just get out a regular deck of cards and play the proper way. . . This versions did tend to even out everything and everyone seemed to have a good chance of winning. However, as you have already probably guessed, I didn't like that part of it either.

I expected to like this game since I'm fan of Richard Garfield, but I just hated it. If I want to play a climbing card game then I will play Haggis, a more serious and interesting game, and to change seats with others each hand then I'd play dancing eggs which is actually fun...This game was boring and too simple for me, I will play it again just to check if I missed something.

Game in a Nutshell: Play to get rid of all your cards. First player to go out gets the top seat continuing down to the biggest loser. Give an advantage to the winner, handicap the loser, and repeat. 

Played as: 4-8 players

Pros: Not a horribly tough game to get a grasp of. Can work with a larger group and chicks dig it.

Cons: There's no definitive end to the game, just when people play long enough that they're bored with it. Being stuck in the scum, or last place seat stinks and makes for an awful, awful gaming experience.

Other: I played this with a regular deck of cards under the alias 'scum' where house rules may vary versus this commercial version.

Best Use: When you only have maybe one deck of cards and need a party game.

I'll never seek out this game, but I'll play it if a group insists.

There are clever plays to be made, but in the end, I think with any hand, there is an optimal algorithm and the game simply isn't interesting enough to learn it better.  I think with equally skilled players, it will always come down to the hand your dealt and the game essentially plays itself.

There are far too many better fillers in existence to waste much time on this.

Harmless party game.  Try to get rid of all your cards first & you're the Great Dalmuti.  Each subsequent player to get rid of their cards falls into place in the hierarchy until there's one player left who's the Great Peon.  Players change seats & sit in hierarchical order.  The GP give his best two cards to The GD, he in turn gives his worst cards to the GP,  others swap cards according to the rules and then the next round is played.  The Dalmuti is trying to keep the title whilst the others are trying to move up in the ranks.  For maximum fun play with hats (peon wears the lamest of course) and kibitzing!

A lot of people have played scum with a deck of cards.  I was never a huge fan of that game, but The Great Dalmuti adds a little change that kind of mixes things up a little bit.

The Great Dalmuti is a ladder climbing game with cards.  The object is to be at the first position, and you do so by getting rid of all your cards before anybody else does.  So based on when you go out, the seating positions change from game to game.  There is no real scoring, or winning involved, you just play until enough people are sick of it and then you stop.

The deck has cards ranging from 1 to 13 (it might be twelve) where the number of cards for a number is the same as the card number (was that confusing or what?).  So there is one 1, two 2s, three 3s, etc.  After dealing out the cards, the top player and the bottom player swap two cards, the top player can give whatever they want, but the bottom player has to give their best two cards, 1 being the best.  The second and second to last players also swap one card in the same manner.  I forgot to mention that there are jokers, if a player has both jokers, they can show them to everybody and declare that swapping cards doesn't happen this time.

After swapping cards (taxes) the top player plays whatever set of cards they want to.  A set is any number of cards with the same value, so you could play 3 7s for instance.  Play then goes around the table with each player needing to play a set with a better number, the lower the number the better, but the set has to have the same number of cards.  So in my example the next player could play 3 4s.  Play continues around until everybody passes, either because they choose to or have to, and the player who played the last set gets to start a new set.

Like most card games, there is a large amount of luck involved here.  This is partially by design, but due to the swapping of cards, the top positions and the bottom positions usually don't shift much, most of the movement is in the middle.  This is an okay game, and I prefer playing this over the standard deck of playing cards version any day.

That said, sometimes people can take the ranking a bit too personally for casual play and the game lacks depth for really long play sessions. If you're looking for a good game to play with your family after Pokeno has run its course, I definitely suggest pulling out the Great Dalmuti.

We've been playing this for years, and since you need 5-6 players to play it right, it doesn't see much action anymore. Still one of my favorites.

RATING: 5
This reminded me a lot of Haggis and other ladder-climbing games, but I appreciated the fact that this game is a very simple entry in that genre. My biggest issue with Haggis was how the bomb combos worked, and it made for a difficult rule to remember. Here, you're pretty much just playing a card or a set of cards to trump what someone else has played. I do miss being able to play straights here, which is something Haggis did well with, but otherwise I prefer this game in comparison.

That being said, I think Tichu is still my go-to ladder-climbing game. This game is enjoyable, and I do like how tongue-in-cheek the humor is when it comes to the titles that each player possesses. It's just not that different from anything else out there.

Changing seats based on your social level is stupid though.

This game works well as a pre-game to a fun time game night. Pair this with alcohol and the hierarchy becomes a drinking game almost without any effort in creating. The jester will always drink, the great dalmuti will make the jester drink...and everyone else will do what they can to loosen up the evening.

The Great Dalmuti is a fun game for evenings when you're with at least 5 people and you don't feel like playing a strategic game. 
We always play ten rounds and everyone who has played his last card gets as many points as there are people still playing at that moment.
We don't use hats but maybe we will try it at some time :-)
The only extra privilege we use is that the Great Dalmuti can stay on is seat; the other players have to switch places.

The lack of a goal other than "win the current hand" makes it more of an activity than a game, but you can come up with scoring methods and objectives on your own.  Wears out its welcome fairly quickly, and the fact that the losers of the previous hand have to give their best cards to the winner totally sucks.  I didn't play with the servility/role-playing factor, so you could argue that I didn't get the full experience, but I am certain that it wouldn't have increased my enjoyment (or lack thereof).

Nice card game.  Can be taught instantly while shuffling up for next game. Very solid filler.  My rating due to the fact that it is sorta bland and you need 5+ players to really enjoy and I'd probably rather play something more meaty if I have 4 other people around.  Plus all the "musical chairs" gets annoying .  Nonetheless, I'd rarely decline a game.

RATING: 8
By any other name a rose may smell as sweet, but The Great Dalmuti is better than President, Asshole, Big 2, or any of its other incarnations for the pageantry of the Dalmuti/peon hats and the musical chairs. The gameplay itself is almost an afterthought.

Nice game if played with the right people in the right mood! As I have played this again recently I have finally raised my vote. This is how a filler should feel. Great for Non-gamers to play with.

A very good effort.

A society game that can be fun with the right people, but is very luck-driven and gets boring after a while. Rules are quite simple and not very original, and they let you think to have a strategy. In reality, much depends on the cards you draw. What's real fun is that you have a role in the society, that can be higher or lower, and you have to act in the conforming manner: you must think it as an rpg, then, it may be fun.

A great game for family events...besides, there's nothing worse than having to be the Great Peon and having to swipe away all the cards, sitting in the worse chair, having to wear the silliest hat. I wish there were more Jesters however so that the possibility of revolution could occur more.

We play "Asshole" with two regular decks, all cards are dealt out.  President exchanges one card with "Asshole" and play begins.  President makes rules as the game goes along - that do not change the rules of cards / hands / trick taking.. rather social rules for the game.  For example, players that are skipped must stand until they can play again, having to take a drink of liquor if you say a proper noun or the number 5.  Essentially the same game, but a party drinking game.  With the right group, fun!

An excellent, dynamic game. Dalmuti is a fast game that focuses on the current status of the players, rather than how many times they've won total. A good night of Dalmuti is more about how much fun you have and, if you want something to strive for, trying to stay in a top seat as long as you can. And like Munchkin, it reminds players that life isn't fair, and encourages players to enjoy its perpetual irony.

Astute buyers will note that this is essentially a reworking of Rich Man, Poor Man, an age-old card game that can be played with a poker deck. But in this case, the reworked game feels so natural and well-designed that it is well worth the small price of owning a copy (I got mine for a measly $12).

Also note: this game is great with somewhat large groups of people. I would recommend roughly 5-9 players for an ideal game. It can't accommodate as many players as Apples to Apples, but still works great as a party card game.

Gioco di carte veloce e in cui si fanno più partite consecutivamente (la partita precedente caratterizza quella successiva). Giocato nella cerchia dei propri amici (con cui si ha confidenza) permette quelle piccole cattiverie che il piccolo e grande Peone si meritano (reverenze, cambio posizioni al tavolo...). Apprezzabile "Filler" a fine serata, per chiudere in leggerezza e simpatia, soprattutto se si è in molti giocatori (dai 5 in poi). In nessuna collezione può mancare questo piccolo capolavoro!

I played couple of games of this and they were ok'ish. I should've read the BGG page before playing since the interaction between players was pretty non-existant seeing how others traditionally seem to play this game. With beer and snacks, I bet this would be a whole another ballgame :-)

Not a filler, if you play with the ranking-system, but a very good and funny game. First time I introduced it to my gaming group, they thought, that the whole ranking system (and the seating procedure what goes with it) makes the game only worse, but 3 hours (yes, 3 hours!) later everybody loved this game. For me, it's a hidden gem!

Add in some real world benefits (the good chair, positioned near the snacks) and some penalties (have to use the stool or the hard as a brick chair, must wear stupid hat etc) and its a fun game at parties that even typical non-gamers like.

RATING: 1
Very simple, purely luck driven card game with the fact the last player gets usually the worst hand for the next round. The first player gets usually the best hand, so it likely that he will win the next round or at least won't lose. 

The game has no end game condition. It is just pointless playing without any goal. The idea behind the game is just garbage. The game is based on a totally idiotic idea that you should play this many rounds and try to raise step by step, and somehow playing this entirely luck driven game for many hours is fun for someone. It's torture that only ends when you leave the game, seriously, it only ends when enough people leave the table. The unnecessary role-play makes it even worse. Waste of time.

It's just a boxed version of the common card game "President" (aka "Asshole") but adding in the concept of ruling class and peons definitely makes this game what it is. We've played it many times at work and the class system often carries on outside of the game with the most recent Dalmuti demanding things of the peons.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another fun filler game. 

The lowest ranked player has to deal next game and do all the collecting of cards. And the top players from the previous game get to give their worst cards to the worst players, who in turn must give their best cards over. The game sums this up by saying "Life's not fair" and that's quite a fun part of this game. You never want to be the peon and it is important for the other players to remind the peon of their place at all opportunities.

Being in the position of "Dalmuti" (leading player really) means that the following game is easier for you to win as you control the flow. It's very difficult for the peon to win, but the peon can aim to move up a notch or two so they'll be in a better position to win in the following game. Games play very quickly so this constant jostling of position is quite fun.

Certainly a game I'd play again (and again)

Aim of the game?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've spent many an hour playing this game and found that almost everyone introduced to it likes it.

Two things are essential:

1) The Dalmutis can order around the peons. The best seats in the room, fetching drinks, etc. This has gone all the way up to forcing a peon to play from inside a cardboard box, although I wouldn't recommend that for regular play.

2) The wearing of silly hats. I recommend a red and black jester hat for the peon and a Burger King crown for the Dalmuti.

Without the above embellishments, the game would be much more pedestrian than it can be. 

This is a party game for 6 or more people; outside of that setting, it's essentially not playable.

This game falls under game to play with family or non-gamers when I don't feel like playing a game game.  It's a formalized version of "rich man, poor man" with a special deck.

A Climbing game based on the somewhat ubiquitous drinking game called P&A for short.  To be honest, it's not a particularly good drinking game.  With the removal of alcohol, it really doesn't stand up any better.  The custom deck adds some nuance, but doesn't really seem to help the game, which is really more about figuring out the group think than playing the game well.  In that way, it is more akin to bluffing and poker.  While not a bad thing, per se, it is definitely not my thing.  There are far better climbing games out there that offer more skill in card play.

Funny, for as much as I like Dilbert - The Corporate Shuffle, I equally and conversely dislike this.  They are near the same game, but the inclusion of so many 11's and 12's makes this game rather frustrating.  I feel like the Dilbert version gives players more option for control.  In that game every card that you play is ultimately working to win a trick, in this game you are just trying to get rid of your cards.  The Dilbert version feels tight and well constructed with fun special cards, this just feels random and unfortunate.

I spent a lot of time playing this game with friends in university. At the time Magic was big but this game could often tear me away from that menace. There is strategy but I often  used a sequence of card plays that usually won the game. Slight bummer...

A good play to pick if you have a large group of people and want to play something together. It has some interesting strategies, the fun around it can make you laugh all evening. It's a fine game.

For me it fell short because I'm not particulary good in this kind of games, but that doesn't bother me. I don't mind loosing in a game I know I'm not good at. But if you screw up in this game, you can "screw up with strategies of other people" and I just hate how people are blaming me for losing just cause I'm not good at this game. Won't ever play it again.

Again, one of those simple games that can be so much fun. I love to play this on relaxed evenings with some drinks and snacks and a nice group.
Just getting rid of your cards, that's all there is to do. Oh, and hand your 2 best cards over to the great Dalmuti when you happened to have been last the previous round. 
Some might know under other names, A-hole is one my friends in high school used and we played with a bunch of regular decks of cards. But I like this upscaled version just the same.

Part of my 2014-08 little card game crave. I was on the hunt for good card games that would fit into little plastic containers. 

Easy to carry around and easy to bring to the table. 
Among these are No Thanks, Love letter, Tichu etc.

I haven't played this one yet as my normal play is around 3-4 people.

RATING: 9
A great group game. The experience is best when you carry the rankings to the extreme! Make the low level peons get drinks/snacks for everyone. Allow the top level Dalmuti's to sit in the best chairs while everyone else gets lesser chairs to no chair, etc. 

Make it fun and it will be.

I played this game for the first time immediately following learning to play Tichu.  And GD just pales in comparison.  Sure there is limited strategy here but card luck is far more important.  Shifting seats is a pain.  Mainly though it's the limited strategy and overwhelming reliance on luck that soured me when it was viewed in direct comparison to the far deeper and similar game of Tichu.

Clever commercialized version of President/Scum/Black Bitch/etc. (oh there are so many names) -- that climbing game where the winner gets cards from the loser between rounds.

The Great Dalmuti is a slight improvement, however, in that its unusual deck (2xJoker, 12x12, 11x11, ... 1x1, lower number beats higher) results in frequent plays of three or more of a kind, significantly diminishing the advantage of high singles.

I wish I played more traditional card games these days.

Great party game.  I like the fact that it has no definite ending condition--there's a winner each round, but usually no clear overall winner.  Fun to role-play, "Right.  From now on, peons must apologize to the Greater Dalmuti every time they take a trick."

Rated based on the cardgame 'Asshole' which is played with regular playing cards.

There are some small differences to this implementation though, so want to play to see if this is better/worse.

[EDIT] Played this and it keeps the flavor of the cardgame I know, and makes it even better:
a) diminishing number of cards for the top means that games are tighter (as they should be)
b) better artwork

Great game to play with gamers and non-gamers alike, so perfect for a family gathering!

Another fantastic party game.  Pretty much a redevelopment of the classic college card game "asshole" or presidents, but with a twist -- the deck is not evenly distributed, and players in lower positions have to give up good cards to players in higher positions.  This makes it very difficult to change positions, making it quite the thrill when you can climb from greater peon all the way to greater dalmuti.  One of my favorite party games, and one of the few games that's simple enough to play when drinking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's the card game Asshole/President/King/whatever, often played as a drinking game, with a special deck (see: Dilbert Corporate Shuffle).  Because of the special deck, though, people tend to "get into it" more than I've seen when using just a normal deck of cards, plus, the fact that the ranks are of differing quantities (there are 12 "12s", 11 "11s", and so on) adds a layer of strategy not generally found in the game when played with a standard deck.

Fantastic filler game.  My friends will play this any time.  Preferably with the peons wearing funny hats.
Be aware that you play this to have fun, not to win.  A hand is very quick and each hand has a winner, but there is no way to have an overall winner.  The game is also geared towards making the winner of one hand more powerful in the next, but it is very possible for a peon to win a hand.

Most everyone in my family LOVES this game -- I think it's good but prefer something with a little more ooomph to it these days.  I'll still happily play a game or two if the mood is right (read:jovial, silly and/or drunk.)  The trouble is in stopping while everyone is still having fun, since there's no actual end to the game.

Hats mandatory, no two ways about it.  Colanders are great for peons in a pinch.

RATING: 6
A climbing/trick taking game where players attempt to put down matching sets of cards with the lowest number on the cards winning.  Dalmuti can be fast and fun.  Even with analytic paralytics hands of the game do not last that long.  Social interaction is a must as players will change seating and headgear (optional) depending upon their place in the social "order".  Dalmuti does have some weaknesses. Taxation can greatly increase the advantage of the Great and Lesser Dalmuti (and their ability to retain their positions).  Not being able to go first or at least lead a hand can make it very difficult to go out quickly and rise through the ranks.

An averege trick-taking game. Not much to see here, actually. However, there is one strike down for it: the player that won the a round (which is the Great Dalmuti) is able, in the next hand, to take the two lowest cards from the hand of the last place. Not a good mechanic, that makes the rich, richer, and the poor, poorer. But I guess this is common place for the Magic creator! :)

This is a simple filler card game that doesn't take much effort or brainpower.  The best part about this game is the hierarchy of players.  If you're at the top you can be cocky and talk down to the peons, but be careful because next round you could be one of those peons.  It gives players more of an incentive to do well, and sometimes allows for some entertaining role-playing.  I enjoy this one on occasion.

There are similar (and older) cardgames in the world that are much better than this one and which can be played with regular cards  ("Big Two" for example). It really boils down to a very familiar concept with a party element added on. And I do not really care for party elements.

I've come to the conclusion that I usually don't like this kind of thing, because Climbing Games are Bullshit(TM). Attempting to play stuff like Haggis resulted in a giant "meh" on my end, but because The Great Dalmuti leans hard into this (the best way to play is for it's own sake), it inverts and then transcends my typical reaction to these kind of games and results in a rollicking good time that, *gasp*, still manages to have a moderately strategic core!

I am continually gobsmacked that I like this game as much as I do, and while I initially scoffed at the idea of this pile of frippery, I may yet include a few funny hats with my copy just to get into the spirit of things whenever we play.

We usually play this as we eat our pizza at our gaming get togethers.  You play cards in decreasing numbers.  You must play the same number of cards as was led, i.e. four 12s are led, you can play four 11s but not 3 11s.  When everyone passes the last to play leads to the next trick.  The first one out wins the hand and is the Great Dalmuti for the next hand.  Losers become the greater and lesser peons and they have to give their good cards on the next hand to the dalmuti's unless of course someone gets dealt both Jokers and declares no taxation.  It's fun, light and you get to rank on the peons.  It's a lot of fun

Rated after 7 games, where one game means several (dozens of) rounds. This game needs 6 players to be enjoyable and quite a lot of time. Well, of course that is just how we use to play this, dozens and dozens of rounds while drinking beer and spending the evening. But it is nice, that players can leave and join between the rounds. Not the nicest game made, but not the meanest either. Needs correct company, if that exists, this is a game of 8.

I just noticed, that there is a scoring mechanic also. It makes easier to make the decision who won the game, have not used that, though.

This is the formal version of Scum. My wife loves it. It's fun enough but you need a decent sized group and have to play multiple rounds to make it worthwhile.

I haven't found a better way to kill 4 hours with 8 people (and you only need 7 chairs!) One (or Two, or ten) hands of Dalmuti is never enough, and if you break this game out it WILL take over the evening.

The group has to be just right, as well as the mood; but if so - this game is an absolute blast. Best with the proper accessories and seating. Our Greater Peon always sits on the floor.

RATING: 9
Perhaps the best cardgame/filler game in my collection. While others may fanatically hate it, I simply adore it. It's extremely simple in its mechanism yet very deep in it's thinking. One more reason to love it is that the game is unfair. When you're last you really have to fight back (or push others behind you) to climb that ladder!!

RATING: 7
Classico gioco di carte in cui bisogna liberarsi il prima possibile delle carte possedute, chi ci riesce quadagna posizioni nella scala sociale e punti vittoria, divertente perchè di contorno ci si sfotte e si abusa dei più deboli.

I like ladder climbing games and this is a pretty good one.  Almost exactly like a game we used to play on the playground called "President and Asshole" (there may be a more politically correct name, but then it wouldn't be nearly as fun for a 10 year old, would it?), but with a specialized deck.

RATING: 8.5
It was more fun than I was expecting, and seems like the perfect game to play while waiting for the rest of the group (as long as there are at least 4 of you already).  Started with 4, ended with 7, and different dynamics for sure with differing player counts.

And of course it is good to be a Dalmuti.  I was thirsty and had one of the peons bring me water, and of course having the Greater Peon rake the cards and shuffle was fun too.

A very nice climbing game in the family of President, etc.  Nice cards, easy game, social, and slightly broken in favour of the winning players.

Een spel dat je niet te serieus moet spelen en vooral met een alcoholische versnapering erbij goed te pruimen is.

Iedere ronde is er een grote dalmutti en kleinde dalmutti. Deze spelers hebben een kaart meer dan de rest, maar krijgen ook de beste kaarten van de grote en kleine dienaar. Verder is het spel een soort presidenten. Leuk om even vlak voor het eten te spelen.

Themed asshole.  Played asshole almost every lunch hour in high school (or Euchre), so this is a nice blast from the past.  I gave this to my sister for X-Mas last year.  I should find some goofy hats to go with it for her, as I like that suggestion.

Have had a lot of fun playing this game, especially at holidays with family. It gets a little boring if I'm stuck on the bottom for awhile (and this can be a problem with new players), but there's always chance enough I'll get to take down my nemesis, which keeps it worth playing on. Some strategy, but it's mostly a luck thing. However, the big group beat-down aspect is awesome.

Ok game for large groups.  It is related to other games like Tichu, Gang of Four or Lexio.  It is not quite as thoughtful as those other games though.  It is better as a social activity then it is a gamers game.

RATING: 7
A family favorite for many years. I can always get new people to play this and the rules are easy to explain. Somewhere between a party game and more traditional card game. Lots of fun with players willing to have fun. A good filler between heavier games at our game group. Although there is enough luck to allow less skilled players to win rounds, generally the more skilled players tend to pull ahead after enough games.

Simple tricktaking game, but with the right group it's a lot of fun. You need people willing to be a nasty Dalmuthi and a servile Peon.

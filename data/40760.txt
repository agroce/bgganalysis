I had a lot of fun with this dice game. It is similar to Airships in weight and length, but I may prefer this one slightly more. I played with the full compliment of 5 players and wonder if it still does well with less. Time will tell, but so far I am pleased and will be picking up in the game once RGG puts it out.

RATING: 7
One of the better fillers that I played.  Easy to figure out and it takes less than a game to figure out the strategy.  A lot of luck involved with the dice, but a decent amount of strategy to play the odds.  To me, the sign of a good filler is that you should be able to play with good players after 1 play, because if it took multiple plays, you should play something other than a filler.  This one certainly qualifies.

Gotta love the Dice Euros!  Seemed kinda rules-heavy when teaching, but the play was pretty smooth, and not too think-y.  The action cards slow down the game a bit, and some of the person genders are not easy to determine at a distance.  Otherwise, pretty decent game with a good length.

+ Plays quick, but still has lots of meaningful decisions for players as they allocate their dice.
- With only a few options of what to do with your dice, this game plays pretty similar from game to game.


Why it's previously-owned:
Even after only playing this game a handful of times, it was getting old.  With so many other options for quick games and/or dice games, I'm not sad to see this one go.  
This got traded in a big online trade.

It's not that I'm dice-ophobic, but give me a handful of the things and ask me to make sets or runs with them and there had better be something else pretty interesting going on.

We have a number of dice games in our collection and this one ranks as one of the best. You roll the dice then using sets, straights, etc you assign them to get tiles related to provinces, laws or patricians. Then you begin the set collection. However, you only get one use of the dice each turn. So while you might think getting that Britannia province will score the most, if you let that patrician for Germania go your opponents might just take it. The set collection is really quite simple but gives you a bit to think about. An easy yet strategic game.

After buying a few games where the publishers really stinted on the game components (yeah, I'm looking at you Hasbro), it's really nice to play a game where you have nice quality components.  The dice are beautiful, and yes it makes a difference.

Plays well with 4.

I just love this...more than most it seems.  Well, good for me.
It's light dice allocation with lots of dice and a couple wrinkles (you can probably play with senate cards face-up if there are youngsters involved).  You're putting sets of dice in Roman buildings according to certain rules, and the best showing in each building gives you first choice of various collectibles that give you fame points, either directly or indirectly.  
What I love is I have a worker placement game that does not require the deep-level thinking necessary to hold my own against my brainy friends.  That's because we are not really building efficiency engines here; we are more or less just collecting things.  Some of the items we collect can combine with other items in interesting ways (patricians and provinces).  
It's relaxing and fun and there are interesting decisions.  Rome theme admittedly does not really come across (Monte Carlo feels as if it would have been more suitable setting).  You can still find this game if you look hard enough.

Without reading too much into this statement, the game reminds me of a super-light version of Castles of Burgundy.  You are placing dice (8 instead of 2) to compete for resources from the center of the board.  The resources need to be used in conjunction with each other, so you have to play all of the board at least some of the time, and you need to know how to make the most of what the dice give you.  Like CoB, there are always options and dice placement is structured so that you never walk away empty handed.  It just doesn't have the complex interactions of CoB nor the scoring track, so it's harder to see how you are faring during the game.  Somewhat mitigated by the short length, so there's less to track.

I just love introducing this game to fans of dice.  It's like euro-yahtzee, just enough depth to always have interesting decisions, not enough to overwhelm you with rules or AP (although the senate cards do take getting acquainted with).  A classic.

This game gives another unique mechanism for using die rolls.  I like the diversity of the different places you can use your dice.  There is a great variety of strategies that players can use.  Although the rules seemed a little complex at first, after one turn I got it all.  I'm really not sure what the best strategy would be, but I can see myself having fun experimenting with it.

I think my one complaint in the game is just that I'm not feeling a theme at all.  I see the images on the tiles and I get the general idea, but there is a major disconnect between theme and mechanisms.  Lately I've found myself looking for more and more theme in my games and this one definitely let me down on that front.  Still, my wife really enjoyed it and I will be on the lookout for a copy so we can play it some more.

I am not normally a fan of Dice games, not even Dice Euros, but if they keep churning out Dice Euro Games as good as this one I am going to have to change my mind.

I think I enjoy it so much because you have so many options and high rolls are good in some places, low rolls in others, so you are never scuppered by a 'bad roll'. I was also impressed by the many paths to victory. It is a phrase that gets overused in my book but it is certainly true in this game where we had some players scoring 75% of their points from one building and others scoring nothing from that but masses elsewhere.

Played twice the first day then went out and bought my own copy.

I have had my eye on this one for a while, as something different form the rest of my collection, as well as as a light filler. I have regular fortnightly games nights and there are often extra people hanging around after the first game of the night has started, so something fast to fill that time is a good idea.

It seem to fit this bill right now - fast turns low downtime, but just enough meaningful decisions to produce an interesting play. It only takes 45 mins to an hour, too, so it's exactly the right length.

It's quite well-designed, and was obviously a labour of love for the designer (given his posting habits on the game's webpage here). That development care shows in the final product. It's quite slick and has no ambiguous rules (ambiguous wordings, due to poor English translation, is a different matter). The choices are interesting, and the one remove between player actions and victory points keeps the metagame interesting.

Got rid of pre-Melbourne move

RATING: 8
"Yatchee" with a catchy theme - building your influence in ancient Rome by winning provinces from various parts of the empire and then ruling them with your patricians! Roll eight dice over a series of "sets" to see how you can maximize your die placements in several Roman buildings (Senatus, Forum, Castorum, Templum and Latrina). Each has a different "rule" for die placement (similar to Yatchee in some ways) and offers different rewards (provinces, patricians etc). After so many "sets" you total up VPs.

Nicely packaged and produced. Fast moving, die rolling game - lots of options as to where to put dice each roll and lots of ways to get "re-roll" chips. The dice can let you down if you are looking for something specific, but in general there is always something useful you can do which is important in a pure dice rolling game. Plays quickly enough to fit into the satisfying filler category for me.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice filler game where the players get to roll dice and buy influence in differing buildings that result in overall popularity or fame.

Has a similar feel to the Yahtzee's and the Ra:The Dice Game, and the To Court the King kind of a thing.


More or less has the feel of auctioning using dice "straights" or "? of a kinds..."

A fun and quick dice game with a Roman theme.  It reminds me of Tribune in that each round you decide which games you want to participate in based on your resources at hand.  Of course in Tribune you have cards, not dice.  My biggest critique is the euroglyphics on the Senate tiles make no damn sense.  They could have done those better.

I like the nice components (colorful cardboard tiles, nice graphics nice colored dice (better than e.g. Kingsburg).
The game itself is not too special. I like other 'strategic dice games' in the recent past better, but that might be because they were a new twist, then (e.g. Yspahan).
The game itself did not feel too luck dependent, but neither could I say why I won. A little bit arbitrary.

Lighter little dice game with some decent decisions.  Can be very frustrating if played with people who have sold their soul in return for good luck with dice (and yes, Tom Powers, this remark is aimed at you!), but overall if you enjoy Kingsburg/Yspahan-style "roll the dice and try to make them do something useful for you" games, you'll probably really like this one.

From one perspective this is Yahtzee with a Roman theme but that really isn't giving it enough credit. Yes a large component of the gameplay is rolling dice and making sets of matching dice or sequences. Still, the thematic elements of winning provinces, attracting senators to your faction and choosing strategy cards work well together and feel like more than just a tacked-on theme. A highly recommended light game.

Exactly the kind of dice game I like, very reminiscent of Stefan Feld: lots of indirect player interaction, lots of things to do with your dice, lots of ways to score, and often some difficult decisions to make. Sometimes blocking another player is more advantageous than going for something else you need, and turn order becomes crucial in many sections of the board. I wish the 2- and 3-player game supported using the Templum because the game could use more available ways to earn points. The iconography is not great, and new players will spend lots of time staring at the player aid (they should have included more of those). Scoring is also kind of tedious, but ultimately interesting in the way your provinces and nobles are scored with your special tiles.

Shades of a lesser Tribune with dice, which is a bit of an unfair comparison as this is a much lighter game (though with rules that I found harder to grasp) but, on first play at least, it takes almost as long.  Speed should improve with more familiarity, but it remains to be seen whether it will get the chance with the Essen/Christmas rush of games competing for table time.

Like so many of alea's early games, this one gets better with age and some repeat play. The mid-size boxed games have been pretty strong; this, Palazzo, and Witch's Brew are all top-tier, Lois XIV and Augsburg are both very solid, and Glen More, by my reckoning the weakest in the series, is still pretty good.
---
Not a world-beater, but typical alea fare, solid, interesting, well-balanced and well-developed. Pretty thematically thin, but OK. I like it, but I like this sort of unclassifiable game that mixes flavors from different categories (dice, area control, set collection). Not a top recommendation, not as good as Witch's Brew, but pretty fun, fairly fast-moving, and a decent light-to-middleweight fare that doesn't outstay its welcome.
---
Got one rule wrong on initial play, but taking that into account, initial impressions were pretty positive. Fast-moving, but with some interesting choices. Not easily classifiable as it blends elements of various genres successfully. I liked it, although I like dice games in general. Seems like a very solid light-to-medium-weight entry.

RATING: 6
A pretty cool and light dice roller/dice placement game.  Roll your dice and place them on buildings.  Generally, the better your "set" on a building, the better choice you get when selecting what crap you win from that building.  You're pretty much trying to collect crap that forms sets, which score you points at the end.

Overall, nothing awesome or that bad either, but a solid enough game if you like rolling dice.

I quite like this game but not enough to rush out and get it.  I will be happy to play it when Spencer brings it in to work.  Some may call it "Yahtzee on steroids" and I can agree on that.  But not the steroids that help Ben Johnson win gold, but instead the Steroids they give people to help with inflammation.  The ruleset is simple enough, even if it is poorly explained in the rulebook... and the game plays smoothly enough.  The special scoring tiles are essential to the game, but also the part of the game that most confusing to me.  I took a bunch of them but still didn't really score highly from them.  The scoring was incredibly confusing to me, so I had to rely on Spencer working out my best combinations and it would have helped me if I had understood that part better.  Again, open to play it again and maybe I will get more strategy the next time... because I still don't know what I was doing to score the points I did...

Based on 1 play with 4 players:

Not bad, but nothing about this really grabs me either. The luck doesn't feel overwhelming, there's good choices, and the playtime is perfect. There's just more interesting dice games out there IMO.

Also, and I harp on this a lot, the textless cards are REALLY bothersome here. The slowest part of the game was waiting for people to read the reference sheet so they could pick a card.

An ok 30' diversion for 2-3 players, and a much better game for 4-5. Lots of luck, but some interesting decisions as well. Harmless fun. Bonus point for the latrine and for being able to speed up the end of a round, malus points for the lousy senate card iconography.

Dice game where dice are used in an innovative way. I didn't like it at all, as I thought that rounds can end too abruptly so long term planning is almost impossible.

It's not a bad game per se, but if I wanted an alternative dice game, I would play Airships, Stone Age or Kingsburg any day before playing this again.

5/09 - changed rating to 6 instead of 5. Played again and it was definitely better with 4 players instead of 5

RATING: 7
One of the best dice games around. Aside from the coolness of including 40 dice in 5 colors... Turns are very fast. You roll your dice, and allocate some subset. Not rerolling all the time like most dice games. There are reroll chips, but they're not used very often. Then on your next turn you roll the dice you have left and allocate. There's way more player interaction than say Roll Through The Ages. Both in fighting for the same thing, and paying attention to what other people have, and thus might want (as you tend to want sets, where a set is a building of a particular color, and a man and a woman of the same color). There is strategy, but it still feels light. Fills a niche really well.

Minus .5 for the craptacular insert.

A very strategic "Yahtzee-esque" dice allocation system, that allows you to claim points in different ways.  Plays well with 2 players. Picking up patrician tiles is fun. I'm thinking of applying labels with word descriptions to the S.P.Q.R. cards so as to minimize reference card consultation.

RATING: 7.5
This game does something I really like - adding a sense of order and strategy to a completely random event (rolling dice).  You always have plenty of choices after your first roll, but with each successive turn you have to be picky and your need for luck increases.  This is cleverly offset by the abundance of re-roll tokens.

Although the theme is not well-incorporated, the components are great.

This is just a pleasant game that's easy to learn and to play.  Thumbs up!

Components: Fun artwork; shiny dice. The iconography on the Senate tiles leaves much to be desired.

Experience: Quick playing, mostly easy decisions. I really like that every die will get me something, so they're never completely wasted. I enjoy shifting focus on the three main areas of the board, depending on which tiles are available.

We play that a man and woman are allowed together in a province not because they're going to get married, which is heterosexist, but because we want gender diversity in the provinces.

Only good if played fast. Instead of using a resource like money or abililities some drunk wargamers or roleplayers wanted to roll dice instead. It works but annoys me.

Played a German copy without a good English translation, so I'm not sure if what we played was what the publisher intended, but overall I felt like this was a fun dice game with an interesting set of choices and a bit of a push-your-luck feel.  Looking forward to the chance to play it again.  

After playing it a few more times I'm sold, I have to own it.  It plays quick and avoids the slow death spiral common in many other dice games where the game end gets delayed by one player capturing a card or other goal from another player who needs just one more to end the game.

Alea Iacta Est is a set collection game, based on dice rolling and placement. There are 3/4 different places, where one can get resources: bonus cards (they are kept secret, and provide a bunch of victory points should their conditions be met), patricians (in different colors, worthless if they are not sent to Provinces), Provinces (in different colors, needed to "activate" a couple of Patricians) and, in 4 and 5 players game, some other victory points.

AIE has two interesting features that make the game more appealing that other dice rolling games:
1) There is no engine, so your bad first round will not entirely screw your game
2) The end of round conditions disallow to play the waiting game, which is a usual choice in "majority" games.

Players are Roman nobles, trying to amass influence in the provinces.  Excellent die rolling game, where on your turn you roll your remaining dice and place some into an area on the board.  Temple grants fortune, Senate grants end of game bonuses, and so on.  Fast, fun, and some stuff to think about.  Very impressed.

Another Euro-style dice chucker which is no different than any other Euro-style dice chucker, apart from the title which is actually worse and must have cost them some sales.   Roll (and re-roll) dice, allocate them to buildings which earn you people and provinces for points.  The cartoon-ish style helps somewhat.  The SPQR Senate cards give some secret scoring opportunities, but this is one the worst examples of language neutrality that I have seen in a game, as the reference sheet is constantly being passed around.   If you are going to play this game a lot with new people, then you might just make some paste-ups or replacement cards.

If someone had told me this was designed by Stefan Feld (fond of using dice in euros and a point salad), I would have believed you.  Though, this isn't the case. 

There are many things to like about this game:

-There is no player elimination
-It does something different with dice (no Yahtzee mechanism)
-You can mitigate the luck of the die rolls
-The number of dice you assign to areas are more important than actual high numbers
-Consolation prize for people who lose in a competition area.
-You can acquire hidden VP goals, so you're never 100% sure who is in the lead
-There is definitely a sense of timing and brinkmanship that emerges through the game play.

If you looking for a quick dice game with nice decisions you could do a lot worse than Alea Iacta Est.

I think that this is one of the best dice games ever and I suppose this will last very many plays!

It's okay. For a dice-roller, it ends pretty fast (each round and the whole game). It's okay. The decisions are light. The main problem for me was that the SPQR cards, which give scoring bonuses, mean that previous players have the advantage over new players, plus the graphics and scoring was obscure. Once we'd played the game, it made sense and next time I'd make better decisions. But I'm not sure there'll be a next time. It was okay but not great.

I am not sure why this game appeals to me as much as it does.  The dice rolls add luck which I generally don't like, but there is enough strategy to satisfy me.  It is short, easy rules, attractive, with interaction.  I feel relaxed playing this game, yet my competitive nature still kicks in.  The theme is incorporated nicely and the latrine element clever and humorous.  

Many different ways to earn points and since some of those points are secret, hard to know where you are in the game.  I lost by a few points and was surprised--definitely thought I had it in the bag.

This is in the same family as Alien Frontiers, Dark Minions, and Troyes. roll your dice and place them on squares to get points/actions. These dice are used for collecting to maximize your points. It's light and fun, although a bit unintuitive in how it works. 

The poop tokens are awesome. Seriously. It turns a somewhat dry dice placement mechanic (but only mildly dry) into a running joke where the "can't do anything else" action isn't really that terrible because it's kind of fun.

I am sad I traded it away now that I have seen it played.

I have only played the game once or twice with my family, but it seems like a good "I don't want to think" game.  Better than Yahtzee anyway. No major complaints.  Helps that it is themed towards Ancient Rome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A dice game that I actually like!  I was reluctant to play when I saw the dice, but there are so many dice and so many rolls that the luck balances out in the end.  Instead, the game is more about cleverly selecting where you place your die.  The game went quickly, and it was a lot of fun, although the English translation of the rules that we had were frustrating and terribly written.  One rule that's still not clear is whether your SPQR cards are placed face up for other players to see.  This rule would dramatically affect the strategy of the game.

I also love the design of the game.  The choice of colors for the die was nice, and the boards are put together well and really contribute to a well done theme.  The latrina was a nice touch.  I could see this being fun with non-gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting dice roll/set collection game.  Just the right amount of time for a dice game along with plenty of options for placing your dice, which mitigates some luck.

RATING: 6
I enjoy this game.  I was drawn to it because my wife enjoys games that involve some aspect of luck, and any game that involves dice will have at least some amount of luck built in.  There are enough things to do with the dice that you roll, that there isn't a huge luck aspect.  Sometimes you only have one die and you really need to roll something specific, but otherwise things balance out.

My big beef with the game is that the senate cards have no text and rely on symbols to explain what they do.  This is all fine and good if you know what the symbols are, which you figure out after a few plays.  It is a problem when you have new players though.  Especially since the first person to get the cards gets 3 and has to choose 1, and then the next person gets the remaining 2.  Often I have had players take a card because they did not understand what the other cards did.  That is bad.  Otherwise... I enjoy this game quite a bit.

Fun one. I like dice placement games in general and this is an interesting combo of area majority and dice rolling. The cartoony take on Ancient Rome is also fun, and the dice are nice. The only thing that slows down the game are those darn Senate cards. They're language independent and not super clear, so the game pauses while the winner of the Senate has to figure out what each card does. That's the main part that makes debate getting the reimplemented version of this game. On the other hand, this game is nice and compact in comparison. Regardless, fun game!

Game of allocating dice to different activities, to get provinces and people to place in those provinces. Not much in the way of varying strategies or getting an engine going; instead very tactical.

This is actually one of the better dice games that have come out in recent years and haven’t received the appreciation it deserves. Maybe the reason for this is that it is much lighter than most other Alea titles. The game is well balanced, has some strategy and some interaction between players, but still plays pretty fast. While not a fantastic game, it’s a game I would probably not say no to play.

Bardzo sympatyczna gra o turlaniu kostkami. I jako gra z kostkami dość mocno losowa ale o dziwo ta losowość jakoś wcale mi w tej grze nie przeszkadza, zresztą można ją ograniczyć przez umiejętne kombinowanie. Żeby była jasność w grze jest też trochę strategii trochę bluffu. Jak na razie cały czas chętnie do niej zasiądę.

RATING: 8
Another die-rolling worker placement game, in which the sets of dice you roll (straights, pairs etc.) determine where you can place them... this time with a Roman theme and a public bath where your dice end up if you can't place them (or when forced out of the forum).

Points can be scored in various ways, from the Templum, to the outlying provinces and governors... though Senate bonus cards are a great way for getting 'direction' as they give you game-end goals to work towards.

Dice are definitely seeing a resurgence in Euro games, particularly ones like this, Yspahan and Kingsburg where the dice are used in a pretty original way... a fun, light-ish family game and possibly even a SdJ contender.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun dice-based set collection game: get noblemen (and women) by rolling low, and get the provinces they need to establish themselves by rolling high series. Oh, and roll streets to get bonus tiles. That’s pretty much it. Works well with two.

Euro inspired yahtzee variant.  Not that much fun, fairly random, and overly dependent on turn order.  Roll dice, choose one of four places to stick them, and get different VP giving tokens for your efforts.  If your VP tokens work together and are more numerous, you win.  Not impressed.

Likeable enough, simple enough to play with family, deep enough to play with geeks... but I'm not quite wowed.

After half a dozen early games I left this for a while before returning to it. I think I dislike it even more but I can pinpoint why a little better.

The people cards are so good (and so rare relative to the buildings) that the default move is always 1/4 into the people. It's such a default move that it upsets the balance of the game and makes it dull, unstrategic, luck based and just generally boring

Downgraded from 5 -> 4

Jan10:

Despite the slightly rough rules, a real gem of a game is in here. Considering Roll Through the Ages and Raice were among my favorite games of 2009, I'm not surprised to see this one pop up on my list this year.

I really like the combination of set collection and "6Devs" in the form of SPQR tiles. They really give you slightly different strategic paths. (Just like the developments in RttA)

Turns go fast, and there are always interesting decisions to make. Nice game!

Feb10:

It's held up to repeat playing.  I also got a chance to try 4 players to see the Templum in action.  Still a great game with that many people.

I've come to realize that it's more of a dice+auction game than I realize.  You're bidding on the rewards at many of the buildings.

I've seen strategies win with hardly any SPQR tiles now, so they're definitely not that powerful.  I think just a couple to give your other set collection some focus is a great deal.

Yet another light'ish dice-rolling, "advanced Yatzy" kind of game. It works, and the integration of the theme works nicely (although it's the components rather than the mechanisms that provide the thematic "feel"). The game seems very balanced - possibly *too* balanced, as every action seems to give you at least some benefit, and every game ends up reasonably close.

Still, while it's an ok short filler, it's really not that interesting. I wouldn't mind playing (for now, ask me again in a year!) but I don't see this as a game I should necessarily buy.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (May 2012)

It’s been a long time since I played this game. Form my play comments, I wrote that the game has lots of uncontrollable luck AND that it is way too long for what it offers. I remember I had a good time and I’m open to play it again to properly rate and comment. For now, I’m rating it a 5.0 based on my comments and my desire to play. I think it is a great game for the family or to introduce new gamers to our beloved hobby.

Dice games are inherently random and capricious - one can hate the genre but still appreciate a particular game.

Unfortunately Alea Iacta Est has issues that go beyond its membership in the dice games genre.  There are a dizzying amount of decisions to make, but 80% of those decisions are meaningless since they all seem to yield a similar small number of points.  Provinces and colonists are a complete crapshoot, as it's difficult to control which people one acquires and the provinces may not end up matching them at all.

Also the art is unimpressive.  It makes Glory to Rome look like a masterwork.

If I'm to play a dice game I'd rather play Kingsburg, To Court the King, Yspahan, or Roll Through the Ages.  I can't imagine ever wanting to play Alea Iacta Est when one of those is available.  In fact I'm pretty sure I'd rather play Yahtzee.

A nice addition to the alea line and what could be another great gateway game.

Anyone who has played dice games like Kingsburg should have no trouble grasping the basics.  Roll your dice and make a placement... continue round the table until the turn that one player runs out of dice then score.  Repeat until done.

Players earn 'rerolls' for non scoring dice so later rounds the luck element is somewhat evened out.  There is a random scoring element that I really like so even poorer players have a slim chance at a win (a feature that I'd like to see in a lot more games).

Rates a firm '7' for me now, but this may change with a few more plays.

Are dice games the next hot thing? After Roll Through the Ages and Dice Town this is already the third new dice game since the beginning of 2009. While the time and explanations needed are about par with Dice Town, this is the "thinky" game while Dice Town is the more chaotic take-that game. After one play, I prefer the Alea game as it seems to offer varied strategies to victory. But I see a possibility that my appreciation might drop if the different strategies prove to be an illusion and the winner comes down to the best rolls only. Roll through the ages plays in another category as it is more of a Yahtzee filler type game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Enjoyment definitely not increased by the overused theme, which really makes no sense at all.

Not a bad dice game, but perhaps it suffers from settling into a space that is not very comfortable as far as future plays go.  It is fairly light, since it's dice rolling and all, but perhaps too a little too much for what it delivers.  The play time is a little longer than I'd like, and it definitely requires familiarity with the special cards to not drag the play time out.  Having to look up each card as they came out was kind of annoying.

Still, I'd like to play again, since it seems like having played, it may get better next time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Tough to rate. Its a fairly good game, but for a game with dice I was expecting it to be lighter. This is actually quite a heavy game, maybe just a touch less options than Yspahan. Overall I liked it, but I'm not sure if it'll get too many plays (low replayability).

A light and fast (once you know what you're doing) dice game with multiple paths to get victory points.  I thought it made sense to get a few senate cards early in order to give  myself a chance to meet their conditions and score additional points.  I also focused on grabbing guaranteed victory points at the temple.  However in hind site, it might have worked better to just amass as many provinces/people as possible, and if need be, pick senate cards that happen to match what you already have on the table.

After a few more plays I'm thinking I'm finished with this one.  There are better dice games out there and I'm tired of looking up what each of the SQCR tiles do every time I play.

================================================

Tentative second play rating is a 6 - which is a solid rating for me and dice games!  It has a different feel than most dice games with a couple interesting mechanisms - particularly the forum with the dice totaling 5 pips action going on.  I think whomever best uses their SQCR tiles will likely do best although in five player games the fortune tiles can sway the game as well.  It will be interesting to see how this game fleshes out if played frequently enough.

The die has been cast!

The title for this game is truly awful. Should simply have gone with the translation into English.

And the 'Castrum' - this one hurts every time I see it. Poor naming choices all around for this fun game which I like to play. Too bad it is called, "The Latrine Game," even though I have tried to nip that practice in the bud.

Each player has 8 dice and assigns dice according to some rules to one of 5 areas (including the Latrine).  One for some small points, one for rule-breakers/bonus points and the main part of the game for regions and people, for which you need people in appropriate regions to get points (empty regions score less).  Quite diverting, nothing too offensive but not too deep either.  A lot of ways to score and there is always something to do with your dice: poor rolling is not really a drawback here, though once in a while you will want a particular roll (usually a 1 to get a spot in the forum to get a person).  Seemed to take a little longer to play out that the weight of the game should indicate (but we might just have been slow).

Dice games can often be very luck driven, in that a few lucky rolls can skew the outcome of the game. Alea Iacta Est overcomes this problem in two ways. Firstly, each player rolls up to 8 dice, and there are enough dice rolling events in the game that that a normal distribution is likely. Secondly, the game offers enough tactical options (you are rarely "locked in" to trying for a single thing) that there are no truly bad rolls.

That being said, there is some luck in this game, but it seems to come from tile draws moreso than the dice. While often 2-player versions of games have less luck, in the case of Alea Iacta Est I think the opposite is true. Because Forum and the Castrum have a number of tile selections determined by the number of players, there is a greater chance of something useful turning up with more players. While there is also more competition with more players (it is certainly easier to win in the different buildings in a 2P game) a tile can have different value to different players, so getting second or third choice of five tiles still trumps going first with two players. With two, often the reward choices are not that useful. I've only played this 2-player so far, but I think I'll like this more with more players.

RATING: 7
Unlike Roll Through the Ages, which introduced strategy into dice games via your civilization upgrades, Alea Iacta est has you rolling the same amount of dice with the same tricks from round to round. However, a lot of strategy is introduced by the different ways to gain victory points. And since a lot of open and some hidden information makes these avenues more or less worthwhile for you and your fellow players, there is a lot of tactical decisions involved - knowing which fights to enter and which to avoid is crucial to a good end result, and the high level of interaction this entails is probably the strongest point of Alea Iacta est.

Possibly a bit too long for a filler, the game also suffers from the somewhat drab illustrations. Granted, not every game can be Seven Wonders, but the work here drifts a bit too close to cartoonish amateur territory for my taste, especially since Alea games usually look good on the table.

I was hoping AIE would be Yahtzee, but with a point -- and it is! This game is a blast. Highlights include plenty of room for strategy and tactics, nice mitigation of luck (and I love the latrine for bad dice), and some tense struggles at key points throughout the game.

It goes by quickly, and every roll matters in every turn. Top all that off with a short play time and excellent components -- the separated board sections and cartoony art style are especially notable -- and this is just a fun package all around.

Enjoyable and good-looking. Perhaps a tad too hard to build a strategy? It seems you may quickly run out of time to get the things you need, but the number of turns seems right for the game to be fun. Final scoring is a little fiddly but not bad. The playing time of 60 mins seems right, at least w/ 5 players. 
Happy to play again, and rolling lots of dice is fun.

Plays better with: Player aids, for the Senate cards in particular.

Reminds me a bit of Las Vegas. I think playing with available and acquired Senate tiles face up would make the game better. I don't like the placement mechanic for the forum. It seems that you must place late in the round to assure getting an early patrician selection. Those negatives aside, it's an enjoyable dice rolling game with some light strategy.

06/25/11 Played a four-player game. 
The game has a *great* deal of luck. Not only the dice, but which tiles/chits will surface are a complete crap shoot. I found the Senate cards to be extremely variable in their usefulness. Even when allowed to choose between three, often none looked good. If one considered Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers to be 33% luck due to their dice, I'd call Alea Iacta Est 70% luck, due to where you put your dice may be rendered null & void, plus the addition of random chits/cards each round. Oh, and the icons on the Senate cards are almost totally incomprehensible. I'd play it again, sometime, but I'd never ask for it.

I enjoy dice optimisation games, and this one's pretty good, though I think the language independency gets in the way of the game. Some of the iconography is unclear - something which is becoming increasingly prevalent in the boardgaming world as companies fight to produce one international print and thus keep production costs down.

I don't mind language independence - but please do it properly. This one and Inca Empire and Roma are the culprits I've played most recently. The purpose of an icon is pictorial representation. If it's not getting its message across, you need to rethink.

A fun dice placement game. Definitely on the lighter side of the scale, but still plays good enough to enjoy. Quick playing time and scales well with any number of players.

Questioning the scoring mechanism though. If you have excess land, it doesn't seem worth pairing up the people properly, as it's better to make sure each land has at least one person in it. It felt really weird that you're punished for playing "more beautiful" by pairing up everything perfectly.

I bought this game mostly because I couldn't think of anything else to buy that month.  I had played it before and it convinced me it was a decent dice game.  I usually don't like games with a high luck-factor, but this one at least offers you enough options that your random roll doesn't hurt you very often.

In this game you will roll all the dice you haven't placed yet, and then decide which place to put one or more of them.  This continues around the table until somebody has placed their last die and then it goes through the last player so everybody gets the same number of rolls.  You can go to the temple, where you basically just need to have a higher total than the previous high.  This gives you straight up points.  The senate requires runs of numbers, a single die is valid, and the largest runs will be awarded with a bonus card that can really score you some good points.  The fortress is filled up with sets of numbers.  There are regions to match the number of players and the top sets will get first choice on the region they want.  Last is the forum in which you can either place any single die, or a pair of dice that add up to 5.  The trick here is the spots are limited and the dice have to stay in numerical order, so lower numbers are better pushing higher numbers off into the latrine.  These dice will be awarded patrons, which will match up with your regions (they have to be the same color).  Lastly there is a latrine, all dice not placed, and those pushed off the forum will end up here.  Each die in the latrine will give the player a re-roll token.  This is continued for 4-5 rounds depending on the number of players.  Then points are totaled.

Yes, there is still a lot of luck here.  Sometimes you burn through your re-roll tokens trying to get that one number you need and never do. However, the fact that you almost always have a decent play for every roll means you can mitigate a lot of that luck.  The senate bonus cards seem very valuable and getting them early to know what strategy to go for seems to help people to win often.

If you're looking for a simple dice game, where the luck isn't a huge factor, this is the game for you.

I really like this game...don't love it to death...but it is very good.

This is a dice allocation game but the key difference to a game like Stone Age is that the players take turns to place a selection of their dice rather than all at once. 

Whilst it is similar to Kingsburg in that regard, it is different in how benefits are awarded as players can compete for the best dice allocations to earn the 1st pick of benefits from an area. 

The requirements for dice allocation are somewhat Yahtzee-esque in nature but that shouldn't be seen as a negative. 

The one drawback perhaps is the luck element in drawing Senate (Bonus Scoring) Tiles that may not match your intended strategy. But the simple way to overcome this is in getting them early and then persuing a strategy.

I really like how the province and patricians are interdependent. 

I rank it below Kingsburg and on par with Stone Age. 

It plays in about the same time as a Stone Age but isn't as good with 2 players.

Oh, turns out I was mistaught a rule! The round ends on the "set" that any player places the last of his dice (rather than once everyone has placed their last die). This made it more cutthroat and actually a little less fun. Because whatever category this game occupied in my mind, it wasn't served by adding that level of strategy. Downgrading from 7.5

Worker placement dice game. Points are mainly generated through set collection, and occasionally by secret goals. I like this one more than Um Krone und Kragen, but the high emphasis on set collection is a bit of a letdown. The best part is that the game does not use the usual Yahtzee reroll scheme at all. 

Better with lower numbers of players: With five, there's too much downtime, and not enough control either.

An excellent dice game. Turns are quick and players are faced with interesting choices. Some of the scoring instructions for the Senate cards are poorly worded and rather hard to interpret, but this is not a major issue. More significant is the use of "matching" colours on the Province and People cards - these are very dificult for colourblind players. I modified them with small pieces of self-adhesive paper in alternative colours, which works fine. I also replaced many of the dice to prevent confusion - this wasn't required but has made the game easier to track.

[i]NB: On opening the box, my comments were as follows:
Looks excellent, but it's unplayable (by me) until components are modified and 8 dice replaced. I cannot tell several of the colours apart - pale green, pale brown is one problem, purple and blue another. This is incompetent publishing. A pity, and cause of great frustration: exactly what I wanted when buying a game.

Most fun! I really like this game! A great light-medium weight game with lots of room for talking smack! I would say it's similar in game length to say Ra: the dice game! This is because you need to do what you need to do in a short amount of time! Your strategy and collecting victory points needs to be done in only six rounds! A sort of push your luck game...as you might expect from a dice game; however, it does seem more of a controlled game than others using dice! The 2-player game works really well...quite enjoyable! I look forward to trying it with more players! 

Roll the dice, place one or a set of them in a building! Try to win an offered province, patrician, or S.P.Q.R card or be sent to the Latrina...ah yes, the public toilet! A totally unexpected bit of humor in the game! It's always fun, booting someone off from the forum card and sending him directly to the Latrina.

RATING: 5
Roll 8 dice. Decide whether to go for longest highest straight (top 2 get a bonus tile), or for biggest highest group (to claim a father tile for points), or a pyramid scheme for pot luck points, or settle for placing low dice into a low-to-high ordered field to claim children tiles which will only score if they match in colour to father tiles. Go round until someone's played their last dice. Grab tiles, and repeat for 5 rounds. Decisions are pretty simple with only 4 things to aim at, the choice being mainly whether to go all out for something or spread yourself around more. Re-roll chits earnt by leftover dice give a bit more to think about, but I'm thinking this one may not provide enough decision oomph to earn a lot of table time. Replay indicates that there's not enough differentiation between player's strategies - everyone's pretty much going for all the same things, and you adjust the order of what you take based on what you roll. Playable, but not seekable as a result.

"Clever dice placement game, with a bit more interaction than I like. The SPQR cards and minimal on-board icons make it slightly tricky to teach."

What I like:
- Very clever dice placement core mechanism
- Pretty quick (60 minutes for 5p game with 2 first-timers)

What I don't like:
- The round can end abruptly
- A lot of the game is based on majorities, which is not my thing
- There is a fair bit of denial moves and hate drafting
- Boards should be clearer about what placements are legal
- Features get lost with fewer players

I think this is somewhat heavier than BGG voters. I would put it around 2.4--clearly it's heavier than San Juan.

"Dice placing" games have been the trend for the last few years and still are. This is a neat implementation of that. 

Some things don't seem to be very well thought through, why would you ever want to place a 1 and a 3 or even worse a 2 and a 4 at forum romanum, when it will eventaully be filled with ones anyway. You could just as well place your 2 and 4 directly in the toilet. Since there is an advantage to have dice left when the others have already used up theirs you don't want to put two dice at the same time in the forum anyway. 

It's important to know that the senate cards are very important and usually are game winners.

Based on one play: Roll all your dice and then place them on the different areas to win points, people or cities to place your people. But once one person places all their dice, the turn ends and any leftover dice simply get a re-roll token. having the best dice on each location also gets you better items and first choice. It is fun and easy to play, worth a try.

RATING: 7
Very deserving member of the Dice Done Right club.  The game is basically rolling a fistful of dice and allocating subsets of your rolls loosely based on poker hands on buildings trying to win the loot those buildings offer.  This creates wonderful cutthroat interaction as players try to dominate buildings and time the end of a round in their favor. One of the buildings is ignored if there is less than four players, so the sweet spot for this game is 4 or 5.  It's not bad for 3, though. With 2, I would recommend also getting rid of one color province and associated patrician tiles and senate cards that use that color.

This falls a little flat with two, it's better with three, but it is absolutely great with 4 (I've not played it with more yet).  I feel like you really need the Templum building for this to shine.

RATING: 3
Dice often adds a frustrating and sometimes wild but fun personality to a session, but I didn't expect it to be so subdued by seemingly convoluted avenues (I guess to counter the randomness) to collect vps. 

The conditional vp cards were too numerous to anticipate (you needed a reference sheet) so no tension there for me, unless you got some in the first couple of rounds. The visible vps were Roman numerals and small which didn't help evaluating from across the table and as the status was so fractured I didn't really care to know.

So apart from the implied "plopping" sound as worthless dice are placed in the latrine (being from England toilet humour is ingrained), I didn't feel the theme, the fun or tension so wasn't "engaged".

RATING: 6.9
(Only a single 2p play so don't read too much into this)

Pros:
* Dice! No, really, I like dice games and this one does things a little differently than my many other dice games.

Cons:
* The iconography on the SPQR cards is horrible. Consider making copies of the cheat sheet.
* Another of those games where major chunks of the game aren't used for 2 players.
* Hidden score (SPQR) cards. In general, I don't care for surprise scoring at the end of the game and I'm not sure if it's possible to deduce what another player is trying for.

Neutral:
* The insert sucks. You can get the pieces in there, but it's abundantly the insert wasn't designed for this game. Neutral because it has no impact on gameplay.
* For such a light game, the setup is a tiny bit involved. It's certainly not bad, but often when I'm in the mood for something light, it's because I'm also in the mood for something we can get into quickly. Some draw bags would probably help here.

Comparison to other games I've played:

Let's start with dice games. Again, I've only played it once, but it seemed like there weren't all that many decisions to make with the dice themselves. You were pretty much fighting over who got to make the decisions. If you won in the Senate, you get to make a decision on which SPQR card to take. If you won in the Castrum, you got to pick your location chit. For each position you won in the Forum, you got a better choice of the people chits. Aside from deciding if you were going to reroll or not, most of the decisions with the dice seemed obvious. Oh, there's also a wonderful mechanic where the round ends after someone runs out of dice. This does give you a fun opportunity to "waste" your dice in order to reduce the odds of getting bumped somewhere else. Anyway, the point is that games like Alien Frontiers, To Court the King and Buccaneer Bones have a separate puzzle you're trying to solve where you may have the ability to directly manipulate the dice in order to get a result you need. The target is obvious but you need to get the right result in order to reach it. In Alea, you can't directly manipulate dice and it's often obvious what to do with the results of your roll. The puzzle is in what you do with the things you earn from your rolls. It's almost not a dice game. It's more like you're bidding to use an action in a worker placement game, but you don't know how much money you'll have in each currency until you roll.

"Good" rolls don't directly lead to points in this game. F rolled 1-2-3-4-5-6 a couple times and decided to outright take the Senate with a secondary goal of purposefully running out of dice quickly. He then proceeded to draw three SPQR cards that sucked. I think at the end of the game he had four SPQR cards to my two, but one of mine ended up being worth a ton of points (and the other one wasn't bad either) where he was disappointed by most of his. Between the huge variability in the SPQR cards and not knowing ahead of time if anything useful to you will come up, it was hard to know if it was worth fighting for that spot. I think I'd rather play with two SPQR cards face up. If you win that spot, you can either take one of the face up cards or draw three and pick one (but if you take a face up one, you leave it face up in your play area. None of this hidden trackable data crap).

Just realized how much I've written and I still haven't actually compared Alea to anything. For the general feel of the game and the itches it scratches, I probably wouldn't compare this to other dice games.

= 2014-05-22

One play so far. It was fun, interactive, and played well, but, as another reviewer put it, the 2-player game lacked "ooomph". I'd like to give Dice Town a shot and then probably decide to cull one or the other from my collection.

RATING: 6
Light, fun dice game, but nothing jaw-dropping really. Deep down kind of a yahtzee variant with many scoring opportunities. Feels better with more players, because the battle for various spots on the board is more tight.

I like it as a family, gateway and sometimes party game. The rules are easy to explain (only the senate bonus cards symbols are a bit overwhelming the first few games) and it plays quickly, with almost no downtime. Can provide some funny moments as well.

Alea games seem to be getting progressively lighter, which is fine (I suppose) for the mid sized-box games. I loved Witch's Brew and this one is pretty cool too. Easy to jump straight into, the dice mechanism is fun. 

Not sure about replayability, as it is fairly obvious what you need to collect - not a lot of risk or tough decisions involved. Thus, the game is about being just a little lucky enough to get the worker placement reward you need. We'll see if repeat plays lowers the score.

Good competitive dice-rolling game about winning provinces and trying to win and designate the right Roman people to them for points. 

The addition of tiles that give extra point scoring conditions adds another good dimension here. Getting to know what they do from the images on them takes a little while but the handy reference sheet is useful - especially if photocopied for each player.

Plays well with all number of players.

There's not a lot of choices each round, but if you watch your opponents closely enough there's just enough strategy involved in placing your dice. The re-roll tokens are a nice way of ensuring no one gets too far left behind. It's about as simple as dice euros come, but I'm a sucker for this genre anyway.

Looking forward to trying the game with 4+ players to see how the Templum board affects the game.

June '10:  In rooting for this game, I feel like I'm rooting for the underdog.  It's not a bad little game, but it probably doesn't get a whole lot of respect.  Too light, artwork is goofy, it's not a real "board," etc.  But I ignore the critics and say "Have fun with it."  Good time and enough strategy to make it worth while.  And quick.  Great for the start or the end of a gaming session.

Despite my first thoughts of, "I'm playing Yahtzee in ancient Rome.", I have begun to like it more with each play.  Yes you're trying to roll straights or sets, yes you can pick some dice and reroll others (usually).  Despite that, there's a fair amount of interaction and even a tad of thought that needs to be used.

Dude, probably my favorite dice game of all time. For such a light game, there are so many little decisions to make. I love the theme, the dice and how I feel when I play it.

RATING: 7
Alea Iacta Est is a smallish game of dice allocation which manages to strike the uncommon balance between tactics and strategy. One of the most interesting decision points is deciding whether to commit a large chunk of your rolls to winning a particular area, or spreading small sets around and hoping something sticks. The length of a given round is dependent on how quickly players spend their dice, so that's a neat design element too.

I think the biggest barrier to this game is its bulky ruleset, as each area has varied conditions for dice placement and eventual scoring. The arcane icons on the Senate cards don't help either. But even past the learning curve, I find the set collection aspect a bit bland for my liking. I'm torn on liking this, but it still functions well as a super-filler dice game for gamers.

Need further plays with more players to pass final judgement.

Essentially a die-rolling Yahtzee-type game where you place dice (straights, multiples, etc) to gain several VP scoring elements. Some interesting tactical moves to make but otherwise quite static. To Court the King is still a better, more dynamic dice game.

This game also has a rather obtuse scoring system (matching like-coloured patrician tokens to provinces). The special action (SPQR) cards are bloody annoying too. It layers obtuse upon obtuse: don't bother explaining them all. Just start the game and let players read the player aid when it comes to picking the cards.

Bits are cute with good artwork. Jury is out.

Szeretem a kockás játékokat, főleg az ilyeneket, ahol nagyon jól ki van dolgozva, hogy az ember alig érezze, hogy a szerencsének van kitéve. Tulajdonképpen nincs is, hiszen minden kocka ér valamit a játékban. 8 kockával dob minden játékos és különböző szabályok szerint helyezheti le épületekre. Valahol a nagyobb, valahol a kisebb értékek a jók, más helyen a sor vagy a minél később, minél hamarabb rakás. Provinciákat szerzünk és patríciusokkal népesítjük be őket a játék során. Jól kitalált a több játékos esetre a bónuszlapkák szerzésének módja és a különböző pluszokat adó a játék végéig rejtve tartandó S.P.Q.R. lapok is. Egyszerű, izgalmas, családdal is játszható játék a "Kocka el van vetve". Jó minőségű, jó ár/érték arányú játék.

Ennyire jól kiegyensúlyozott játékot még a komoly eurogame-k között is ritkán lát az ember, nemhogy kockások között. Az eddigi legjobb kockás játék, amit láttam.

My first dice group placement game.  It is an improvement on Yahtzee with better options and of course a better theme.

RATING: 8.5
A fast playing dice game that works well with family.

Update: I improved the rating by half a point now that I've played with 5 players.  It seems to scale well for different sized groups.

Update: I've bumped it up another half point.  It is a hit with a wide variety of groups.

Update: Added another half point. High replayability.

Solid worker placement set collection game.  It has lots of fun little choices.  Luck is mostly mitigated, but not irrelevant (so it remains lively).  It is the perfect length for what it is.  A good meaty closer.

What an amazing little game ... I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this game.  I just brought it home this week as part of a package of about 8 or 10 games i purchased and my kids want to play this much more than anything else.  I suspect it will get a lot of plays over time - perhaps even becoming a family favourite like Agricola, 7 Wonders, Thunderstone and Le Havre even though it is a simplistic game.  If you haven't played this, do yourself a favour and at least read a few reviews ...


Think of Yahtzee with some teeth.

I like Alea Iacta Est, it's a nice dice game that takes some of the randomness out of your rolls by allowing you to select the placement of those die on various areas.  Those areas then reward you IF your die/dice beat(s) your opponents.  After a few plays I believe it is fairly balanced game that allows for several options, and this in turn offers some light strategic planning.

Fun little dice game, a kind of Kingsburg lite, I guess.  You have some nice options in where to place your dice and using more dice ends the round earlier, although it comes at a cost of not getting quite as much.  Overall, some nice light decisions in this one.

UPDATE: Second play not as good as the first.  It's not a bad dice game, but I can't say it's supremely compelling.  The "ladder" element like Tichu is interesting for sure, but there are better dice games out there.

Yet another dice rolling game, this time with another level of complexity: roll combinations to collect VPs or sets of tokens worth VPs. Not bad, although I'd like to play it with the correct rules before passing final judgement!

RATING: 5
The decisions aren't compelling enough to give it long-term replayability.  The decisions just aren't interesting enough.  Also features a fairly lengthy rulebook for a dice game.  Needs a re-roll.

RATING: 6
This game plays a lot like Alien Frontiers but I like Alien Frontiers a bit less than this one.

The reason I feel it is more similar to that game than something like Kingsburg or Troyes is, like Alien Frontiers (the main thing I disliked about it), in this game actions are taken with sets and runs or specific combinations of dice.  I much prefer the dice rolling/worker placement mechanics when they are based on dice value solely because luck becomes exponentially more a part of the game when you just don't need to hope you roll high numbers but you need to hope you roll multiples of the same numbers or a run of numbers in numerical order.

This game didn't really bludgeon you over the head with it though.  For starters each player is rolling 8 dice a turn so that's a much larger pool than something like Alien Frontiers (or even Kingsburg, Troyes, or any Feld game).

Secondly, while the spaces require a run or sets to use, those requirements are fairly loose.  A space that requires a run for example could be a run of 1,2 or even 1.  A space that requires pairs, triples, etc. will also accept a single die.  However only the top 3 or 4 people will get a reward from a space.

Finally, while 3 out of 4 of the spaces require high rolls and more so, high rolls in some sort of run or like combination to get first pick there is also a 4th action space that requires low rolls.  So players have the opportunity to use lower rolled values to their advantage over other players who may have rolled "better".  And any dice that aren't allocated reward you with re-roll tokens.  This makes them very plentiful and the opportunity to manipulate your rolls very available.

In the end this is also not the deepest game but it does play quickly so not bad for a filler or introduction into these mechanics.  Not something I would want to own compared to Troyes or Kingsburg but not something I would be disagreeable with playing on occasion either.

Decent dice game, that is more about making the right 'bids' at the right time, than about pushing yor luck. I've only played this with two, and while it works, I can see it being better with more. With two, you'll almost always get something in each category, while with more, you'll probably have to choose what you want.

RATING: 7
Quite a bit of luck, but it is balanced with a decent amount of ability to mitigate it.  Very little ability to slow or thwart another player without sacrificing your own points as well.  The SPQR cards are a nightmare for new players because they are very poorly explained without going over each one, which would take forever before a first game.  Also they even take several plays to really become familiar enough to make accurate choices for your dice placement because you just won't have a firm handle on the trade-offs in potential scores between placing in the Senate and elsewhere.  It's a shame because the rest of the game is actually quite straightforward, and the SPQR cards seem almost like they just didn't see enough development before the game was released--they mar an otherwise easy to teach, fun super-filler.

The fun we had while playing this arose from jokes about what the English-language edition should be called, once it had been declared that "people" don't know enough Latin any more to know what "the die is cast" is all about.  One suggestion was printable, "Toga Party."  After sending many dice to the latrine, other suggestions were not, such as "Shitload of Dice."

[RGG 2010 edition] {Dice; worker-placement, dice-rolling; scalable} AIE is a simple worker-placement game using dice.  Luck is not too strong and decisions can be meaningful in this game.  Player interaction is good as players need to compete for many resources.  This game can provide multiple paths of victory, good.  In all, this is a nice dice-rolling strategy game.

The use of icons on the Senate cards are very confusing.  To understand the cards, it needs many explanations.

After a couple initial plays (2 player only), I'm really enjoying this.  Not sure if this or Ra the Dice Game is my favorite dice game.  Update: plays better with 3, but the game is almost too long for what it is with 3.  I’d like to play 4 players, as you add another building to place dice on, and it lasts 5 rounds instead of 6.

Love this! On the surface it looks like a typical dice game, but there's something you can do with almost any roll, there's lots of fighting over position and majorities, and there's many ways to score. Seems to be best with 4 players.

RATING: 5
I love dice games, but this one misses just a bit for me.  I despised the special cards because I thought the iconography was terrible.  So bad in fact that I stopped trying to get them because I couldn't be bothered to figure out what they meant.  Second, I didn't like the blind draw of VPs on the one building.  Third, it just seemed a bit mediocre to me.

If you want a dice game, then play Ra: The Dice Game.  This one is okay and I'll play it if asked, but I wouldn't seek out a game of it.

RATING: 6
Decent dice game. Players adopt the role of a potential Roman Emperor and have to assign dice to a variety of different buildings, which in turn offer benefits that can result in victory points. Each building has different criteria for the dice to be placed there (a run of ascending numbers, a run of the same number, the lowest number scores highest etc). The object is to match patricians (obtained from the forum) and provinces (obtained from the castrum). Randomness enters the game through the senate cards which are kept secret from opponents and contain different methods of obtaining victory points. There are also re-roll tokens which allow players who have struggled in the early part of the game to remain competitive and this keeps games tight and prevents a runaway leader emerging. Overall this is a pretty good dice-assigning game, but it has been superseded by other examples of the genre such as 'Alien Frontiers' and 'Troyes'.

My group of people loves dice games, so I picked this one up figuring it would be a hit.  But whenever there's a dice game itch, people either want something much lighter than this (there are a lot of cards and such and not all the sections are particularly self-explanatory), or they'd rather just go for something more theme-y like Elder Sign.  This one gets lost in the shuffle.

Pretty quick and fun.  The game feels samey though, you often play the final round similarly to the first.  A lot less downtime than something like Alien Frontiers, but that's mostly due to relatively shallow decisions.  The scoring is a bit complex, but it needs to be for the game to have much merit.

An excellent new way to use dice in a game.  This game has a lot of different things to do with the dice, so that you can make good use of runs, sets, low numbers, and high numbers.  You can also commit a variable amount of dice each turn, so if you have a terrible roll, you should be able to ditch one die and play for your next turn.  All in all, a clever new game that uses dice.

Played twice with three players and once with 4 players. In the dice game category, this is definitely a step up from To Court the King, but there seems to be a significant advantage in going last for most of the building locations. The components are pretty nice and the game plays quickly in general, but there can be significant down time when a player is selecting the SPQR cards. I preferred it with 4 players to 3 since the Templum is a nice additional option.

hmmm, so far with 2 players, I am less impressed than I had hoped.  Not much tension there.  Still better than Yahtzee.  Id like to try it with 3.
Update - the more I play, the more I start to see the strategic options shine through (dismiss a "better" throw of the dice to help ensure you get more points).  Senate cards tend to be very hit-or-miss due to only 6 throws making it hard to complete your objectives.

Really impressed with this one. It seems to be a lot better than the other Yahtzee-style games that I've played (King of Tokyo, CV, Desperados of Dice Town). You actually have some control over what you do so you never quite get completely screwed over by bad dice rolls like in those other games.

I'm not usually a fan of "dice games" (such as To Court the King and Airships), but am often a fan of games that use dice well (such as Queen's Gambit, Descent, Galaxy Trucker, Byzantium, and Ghost Stories). It's a distinction over which reasonable minds will inevitably differ, but a stark one in my mind. I had thought that games where dice were the focus and that revolved around the dice as ends themselves rather than a means were fatally flawed by definition. It turns out I was wrong. Alea Iacta Est was the first game I tried at BGG.CON '09 and was the first dice game that I enjoyed. It's the latest Alea medium-box game by Allers and Eisenstein (of Aber Bitte Mit Sahne and Peloponnes/Zack & Pack fame, respectively), and destined to sit alongside Louis XIV on my shelf, venerable company indeed. I really liked the theme, artwork, and components of the game, and I found the game simply fun and entertaining. The game flowed nicely with every player having their own dice to work with, and presented players with reasonably tense decisions while still moving at a good pace.

Yahtzee for eurogamers.  Take yahtzee and add some set collection and area control.  Nice amount of tension.  Nice game to kill the time.  It's fun to collect the sets.  Not too long for a dice game.  I enjoy this when I am wanting to relax.

Most euros can be boiled down to the same rote nonsense that alea iacta est is.  This game does not try to hide its simplicity.  I appreciate this.  Collect some sets with the smallest amount of tension possible and maintain the glory of the big rolls.  Survived the euro cleansing.

This doesn't feel like an Alea game, or at least not any other Alea game I've played.  It's much, much more lighthearted, especially the art.  Feels most reminiscent of [gameid=37380], although I prefer RttA for feeling a little more unique and connected to the theme.  AIE is just a little bit more generic, with not much other than the art bringing up a feel of ancient Rome.  I will say that the dice have the same compelling charm that they always have, and that I really enjoy rolling and seeing what I get.  It's a solid, though not exceptional dice game.

RATING: 8
Roll your dice, place some on various buildings in various ways (sets, straights, low values, etc). Re-roll the remainder, add them to the buildings. Once the dice have been placed, better combos earn you first choice at taking provinces, citizens to man them, secret bonus cards, etc.

A straightforward dice roller, but an enjoyable one. I always like grabbing handfuls of dice and chucking them into a dice tray. Some decisions to be made, not mind numbing, but enough to keep you interested. And, your plans can go awry when someone outdoes you in an area. But, you have the ability to add new dice groups or extend previous ones, and can reclaim them.

Yahtzee variant with pasted-up theme. Looks good, but the SPQR tiles are not so clear.

Roll dice, pick a set, queue etc of them and place to a corresponding building. Next player. Once one player is out of the dice, the round ends. Collect tiles. Repeat five times and calculate points.

Ok game, needs to be played fast in order to have the proper time/heaviness ratio. Should be ok for casual gamers, too.

There are a lot of worker placement dice games out there, so when a new one comes along, I expect it to do something pretty cool that sets it apart from the rest.  Here, players get a chance to reroll remaining dice when their turns comes around again, and it makes a difference in how you approach the game.  There's still a "The strongest set wins this region" aspect to it, but there's a nice tension that comes from rerolling the dice, and the way that players place dice into the columns to take people.  It's still a bit random, but it's a dice game, and besides, there are reroll tokens and other ways to alleviate the luck of the rolls.  It also seems a little same-y, since there are a limited number of buildings to use, but so far, I've only played it with 3 players, and fewer buildings are out.  Playing with more players and all buildings might make the game seem less repetitive.

One thing I found odd about the game is that there seems to be very little incentive to place two people into a province.  There's a Senate card that gives bonus points for couples, but that seems to be about it.  It feels like the game needs some different way of scoring provinces to make players more motivated to place couples, otherwise players can just make land grabs early in the game and then collect whatever people they can in future turns.

Players take on the role of Caesar and compete for the most prestige points. This happens by clever placement of his/her eight dice, which are placed on five different buildings.
\13\\13\
At the Castrum (barracks), new provinces can be conquered, while patricians can be recruited at the Forum Romanum to be sent to those provinces. At the Senatus, cards can be won for bonuses that will be kept secret until the end of the game. The Templum awards prestige points directly from the Goddess Fortuna. Each die that does not win any of these ends the round at the Latrina, where it provides its owner with a “repete!” chip, which can be used to re-roll dice or can be traded in two-to-one for prestige points at the end of the game. Each building has special rules as to how the dice can be placed, allowing many tactical possibilities with any roll of the dice.
\13\\13\
Each round ends when one player has placed his/her last die, and after 5 rounds (6 rounds with 2-3 players), the patricians are organized in their provinces, the senate cards are revealed, and the scores are totaled. The player with the most prestige points wins!

RATING: 7
Si tratta di collezionare bonus (Patrizi, Province e carte Speciali) e combinarli nel miglior modo possibile, ma il tutto e gestito con il piazzamento di 8 dadi che devono essere inseriti in maniera molto tattica. Leggero ma molto divertente.

A dice game that is really more of a worker placement game.  We played with a German set of rules that had us struggling through the rules and the scoring cards, but I think I am going to really like this one once it shows up in English.

Played it in English, and I liked it as much as I expected to.

Dice placement but it comes off as a little stale.

I think there are some things that would really make the game interesting (like having the dice at the right end of the columns choose first for patrons) but I'm still going to give this game a few more plays before I pass judgement on it fully.

RATING: 6.2
This game works but has the problem of being really not very fun. It isn't involving at all. There are some minor decisions to take, everything is governed by chance. You just throw dice, put here or there and take some cards. Put the card togheter and make points. Nothing wrong with the mechanism but I wouldn't use my time to play it again, i am sorry

RATING: 7
I am impressed by how well this game provides the players with meaningful decisions to make each turn. Although it is a dice game, the players aren't simply at the mercy of luck; there is a lot of room for strategic and tactical thought. The game itself is relatively compact and easy to set up, and the rules are simple enough to be explained easily.

RATING: 7
Initially, I thought this game was very good (with capital letters) but I found it long by the end. It gets a little repetitive, especially since nobody in my circle went for the Senatus cards. Despite being written on the cards, I had a hard time remembering what combination of dice was appropriate for certain buildings. So in general, some minor details I did not always remember and I certainly felt it dragged on but it is quite good overall. I would play it again, but it's not a favorite.

Dice game set in Roman times. Let the die be cast. Competing dice combinations for set collection of laws from the senate, provinces from the castrum, nobles from the forum, and prestige from the templum with dead dice going to the latrine. Easy to teach. Simple, light, and fun even if it is another Caesar era themed game.

Two very slight problems; Most important you can see the color of patrician and provinces in the stack so you know what is coming up. This is easily fixed by drawing from cloth bags. The other is the yellow and tan colors are hard to tell apart. This is fixed with brighter lights or better eyes.

Entertaining, with some interesting choices. Plays quickly too. Feels a little too balanced though, like everything is worth almost the same amount and it's going to come down to some tiny tempo advantage at the end or a good Senate card. Does have good interaction in that it is really important what others are doing and trying to navigate your roll against the situation on the board and the number of remaining dice each player has. But I feel like too often there isn't a set of good choices to make, especially as you have less dice available later in the round (rolling high with just one or two dice left can leave you without a place to make any difference). Happy to play, but don't see myself suggesting or pushing it.

Very interesting dice game. There are 4 places to play and certain sets of dice for each space. The winners choose first in the set collecting phase. Losers do get a consolation prize so it is not a complete bust for a player each turn.

There are just much better dice games. I felt the dice action works well but the things you acquire were not that interesting. There is too much randomness in what you get and too few rounds for it to even out. I will not buy this although I do not mind playing it.

Kingsburg with more dice. Roll these dice, make obvious "decisions" about where to allocate them. Hope other people that one-up you don't select your desired prize. Getting shafted, especially on the last turn, can easily cascade down the queue into further shafting. Roll the numbers you need and pray for good timing. Doesn't take three hours like Kingsburg.

dice rolling/worker placement where best/most/first dice "sets" placed allow choices of different set collections of tokens and bonus cards, best combination of collected sets and bonuses wins at game end, 2 player is probably ok, 3 was good, 4 is great, 5 might be too many...

I think it's the best dice game ever. A lot of planning and strategy for a dice game. If you count on luck only you will loose terribly (tried that once :( )

I think my rating is closer to 6 than 7 but for just the fact that I liked playing this game (I don't like dice games) deserves to be rated as 7

A quite enjoyable game if you like dice allocation.  Even if you don't I think the balance of drafting the best proviinces and people vs. fulfillinf bonus point tiles is interesting.  There is quite a bit of downtime as people figure out what to do with their dice though which can make this run long.

Quite a neat design that draws its arrangement of different suits in columns from Lost Cities. There is a bit more going on in that the multi-purpose cards can also be used as money to buy multipliers for your columns or as passengers, who in multiples of four trigger a scoring of all columns of their colour. Ten scorings and the game is over. It's a balancing act between extending columns, scoring colours where you have the advantage and keeping enough money to buy the next multiplier. Those decisions are made less interesting by the restrictions on play to columns (each successive card must have a higher value). There will be cards that you will only want to turn into money and others that are clearly best used as passengers.

Production quality is good.  The artwork is pleasant if non-descript. The rules are clear.

As others have noted, this is an interesting twist on the mechanism most of us first saw with Lost Cities.  It's a bit more complicated, not quite as elegant, and, obviously, not so original.  As a consequence I've given it a slightly lower rating than Lost Cities, but it is a good addition to my collection of small, 2 player games.

At first glance, I thought this might be a game that replaces Lost Cities in my collection, but after couple of plays I realized that Trambahn is quite different game. For example blocking is much more present in Lost Cities. The scoring on the other hand is more straightforward in Trambahn. I wonder why Trambahn is designed only for two-players? It seems it could have been designed as well for three or four players.

Tight two-player card game, you're collecting sets of like-colored cards under purchased trains to form routes, and then you can score them once you fill up passenger queues. Go for big combos, the more pricey the train the higher the multiplier for your route, and this is another game with multi-purpose cards (passengers, routes, and also cash for purchasing the trains). Nice historic look, though I wouldn't have minded a little more variation on  the actual card images. Classy stuff.

A quick playing two player card game with interesting decisions and a train theme. It's light enough to play with non-gamers, but has sufficient substance for a gamer's filler.

The multiple ways in which you use the cards and the different routes to victories gives the game it's angst and it's charm. Sufficiently short to leave you hungry for more.

After 9 plays, I'd say it's a very good couple's game.  Players can pursue multiple strategies (long routes and game versus short routes and game, focusing on one or two colors versus generalizing).  

Ultimately, it's a card game and luck of the draw will determine the winner among players of equal skill.  but even so, it's a nice way to relax with a significant other.  No tearing each other down, just trying to make your plan work best.

A step up from Lost Cities, which is already one of my favorite 2-player game. Building a tram line isn't as exciting but it does offer some nice decisions whether you should build some quick scoring or lines or build up a monster line to score tons of points. Ultimately I wasn't getting this to the table enough but it's a very good game for couples!

This is sort of an advanced Lost Cities. I got the same vibe when playing; you sit there and sweat over which cards to play and which to discard etc., and this is definitely what make this game a good 2p game for me. I would much rather play this than LC, Battle Line and all of those kind of 2p game, but Trambahn does fall short of the excellent 2p games out there like Agricola ACBAS and 7W: Duel. 

The luck of the draw is definitely there, but it doesn’t bother me too much as it seems you can build and play around different strategies. However, sure, if you don’t get any of the high value cards, you’re likely not going to win. Of course, it’s also crappy to get the high level cards at the beginning, just like in LC.

The scoring adds a nice twist as you yourself are determining which lines score, and the fact that the game ends after 10 scoring rounds makes it kind of unique as it’s player driven. And if you don’t keep track of what your opponent does, you might be screwed...

It’s not immediately obvious how to play well, and I think there is some strategy to the game. The passengers, when to score, how to act and react to your opponent etc. A fine and enjoyable 2p, although not top tier material.

Take Lost Cities and give it multi-use cards and that is Trambahn. Using your cards you either, push a color towards scoring, build ascending order rows in your tableau, or put money towards buying trains which you need in your tableau. There are 10 scoring rounds when a color has 4 scoring cards in it. Overall it just felt like an overly complex version of Lost Cities to me and while I love games with multi-use cards this game just felt too complicated for what it was.

Trambahn brings to mind an immediate and obvious comparison to Lost Cities, along with some of the same tension that LC produces.  There are a few more moving parts here which keep things interesting -- turning cards into currency, trying to trigger scoring rounds that play to your advantage.  I don't really care for the rule that requires players to give up half their bankroll when the draw deck is refreshed, though I know that adds yet another element of tension to the game.  We actually forgot about that rule in our first play-through -- will see how it pans out in future plays.  Overall a great 2 player game.

Trains
Grid marked by cards players use their cards in three different ways: as passengers on the trams, as suggested stops on new routes to be built, and as money to pay for these routes. When laying out cards for suggested stops, players need to both match colors and build them in ascending order — but they also need to bring passengers to this tram line in order to score victory points for it.
The cards resemble postcards that feature street cars in Munich and historical parts of the city.

RATING: 7
Two player card game, where players are trying to develop an early tram and train network in 19th century Munich.  Players on their turn play cards as either passengers, stations or flipped onto a pile as cash.  Stations have to meld in Lost Cities fashion (ascending order, in their colour), and one or two cards must be played as passengers.  Trams and trains have to be purchased to run on the player's melds of stations.  When four passengers of a colour are deployed, then a scoring is triggered for both players in that colour, which is simply train value times station value.  Ten scorings ends the game and points are tallied.

Ultra fast game, seemingly drawing a lot on Lost Cities.  It's not as elegant as Lost Cities, but does ask nice questions of the players as the cards have multiple uses.  This one is growing on us.

Trambahn does indeed work as a push-your-luck set collector, but don't hold your breath for much beyond this. While at first the idea of multi-use cards (passengers/trains/money) seems interesting, it quickly becomes apparent there is very little decision making to do. Managing your money is simply playing the obvious cards each turn and simply dumping the rest of your hand as income. The game then just boils down to who is luckier at getting the cards they need.

Again it is fine to play, just very forgettable.

Lost Cities with trains. Play your multi-use cards as passengers, stations or money to make the most points from 10 scoring rounds, and plan to trigger extra scoring rounds for yourself only during the game. Setup is quick – lay a few cards out on the table, shuffle the deck and go!, the decisions are interesting and sometimes really tough – whether to hold back cards to start a new line, which ones to play as passengers or save to increase the value of your line, which ones to keep as money, which lines to invest in, how often to score etc. Luck of the draw can be frustrating – sometimes you can't get any cards in the colour your opponent is scoring, or you only get really high cards and then the decision becomes whether to turn them into money or play them knowing you can no longer expand that line, sometimes you only draw a hand of cards that will help your opponent when you play them as passengers so you just have to suck it up. You can catch up by saving money and buying the more expensive trams which have higher scoring multipliers but then you have to be aware of the timing and can't hold back too long otherwise it won't pay off if you can't score them enough. I would equate decision making to Patchwork level so if you enjoy that, I'd recommend this.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting set collection game very reminicant of lost cities, but with a little more to it as you can play the cards as money, trains or as passengers which bring you closer to a scoring round. There is some player interaction in the passenger mechanic in that you can bring about a score in one colour before you opponent is ready to score in that area, however it is still quite a solitaire experience.

It's very slow to get going and quite luck dependent and there is really nothing you can do to mitigate this luck. The tram cards feel a little overcosted especially the 'electric' trams as you acquire them so late in the game the x4 multiplier is fairly irrelevant as you end up playing so few cards to it.

The Keltis/Lost Cities derivative that Knizia forgot to make. Granted, that's a bit unfair. Trambahn does have its own style for sure, and, when looking at Lost Cities, seems like the better game because even though direct interaction is somewhat reduced (and it wasn't exactly through the roof to begin with) the potential for screwage is greatly improved. Sure, there is quite a bit of luck involved in drawing the right cards but the game is short so that's forgiveable. Don't go in expecting anything earth-shattering, though (nor a train game, for that matter).

Components: not bad quality on cards
Complex: easy, just need to understand how to score
Weight: family
Players: 2
Length: 30 mins
Mechanics: make sets of cards and try to control which one will score
Decisions: not many, but enough for this kind of game (which passenger go for scoring, which cards to set your rails or move cards for money....same cards for everything)
Opinion: nice twist on Lost Cities, improving the game for me. While I only decide which colors will go for in Lost Cities, I have to think more in this one. You can have several rails with the same color, should I go for a couple of the same color for scoring or for a big one and the extra scoring.
The scoring part is the best for it. You play one or two passengers of one of the four colors, and, once there are four passengers, that color is scored. Think what color you need to score.
And also the money part, the same cards could be money, and you need this money to buy the trains for your multiplier. Never have enough money without discarding those good cards you need for your rail.
As already said, nice twist on Lost Cities that could have more plays than expected

A lot of depth from a stack of well illustrated cards.  Trambhan is a very well done, quick-playing 2 player game that is full of agonizing decisions.  Sure, there is some luck of the draw involved, but skillful play still is paramount, and the luck can be mitigated through good decision-making about what to discard and what multipliers to go for.  We find it even more enjoyable than another favorite "filler" of ours, Biblios, which is high praise given how much we enjoy Biblios.

While similar to Lost Cities, Trambahn has a few more levers to pull and your hand of cards goes through constant churn in the style of many multi-use card games. You use cards to start and grow columns of colors in ascending order just like the Knizia classic. Also, you can choose to use cards as money to buy column headers that give increasingly large multipliers as the game progresses. Also on a turn, you must use one or two cards to play to the center of the table as passengers. When four passengers of a particular color have been played, columns of that color score for all players. After 10 scorings, the game ends.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with the game. The required column headings get increasingly expensive but are necessary to increase your ability to play to the columns that score you points. This means that as the game progresses entire hands of cards get converted to money on a fairly regular basis. You can manipulate the timing of scoring and the colors that score so that your strengths are emphasized over your opponent's. However, for all of that, I'm not sure my decisions are any more interesting than the pressure of deciding whether to hold or play a card in Lost Cities. I felt like the greater ability to manipulate the game in Trambahn actually alleviated some of the pressure behind the decisions that Lost Cities forces on a player. Trambahn is perfectly fine, but I doubt I need to own both of these games.

RATING: 7.2
Trambahn是兩人的卡牌遊戲，玩家經營自己的電車公司，建造新的電車車站、發展各方的電車路線，手牌的管理必須取捨拿錢還是留牌，累積乘客搶計分耗回合數也是另一種獲勝方式，每回合拿到高分的卡片都在猶豫是否要等到下一回合拿到可以堆疊的低分卡，如同 Lost Cities 賭下一張牌的心情~

A game about tactical optimization of every hand. I love how what matters is the difference between the players in the value of each color, not the actual value. I love how scoring is player controlled, but has a cost, and not a small one. And the wagons make the game exciting, so do the inflation rules.

All in all, a solid, entertaining, different 2-player game.

This game has replaced lost cities. 

Similar mechanic to lost cities, with more choices. Train lines are your excursions, except you can make multiple excursions to increase points. 

what is different is the game makes your discards worth a value to expand other train lines (even in the same color), and also use cards you may need but can't use to generate demand.  

This one is on the purchase list when I buy my next chunk of games.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is an interesting two player game somewhat in the vein of Lost Cities. My first play I was hammered hard as I couldn't draw yellow but it was a learning game and I didn't do what I needed to do either. Want to play this one more as opportunity presents itself. There seems to be the possibility of a couple different strategies.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I definitely prefer this over the Lost Cities card game in terms of both game play and aesthetics. Great multi-use cards, as you agonize at times over whether to keep cards as passengers/tram stops or relinquish them to turn them into money cards to buy trains/depots.

I like Trambahn, I think it's fun! BUT I wouldn't advise it to a couple of players that are very competitive, because the randomness can get people angry (it's usually a better strategy not to keep cards and make almost all of them into money), and also a very competitive person would disregard the building and rush the scoring, probably winning the game but making it boring.

The game is not fun, way way too luck dependent in my 3 plays of it, it came down to me getting nothing but 2 or 3 point trains built, in one or two colors while my opponent was running lines down that were 8 to 9 points worth on x2 or x3 lines, getting all the jokers, running 3 bonus scores of 24 points within 4 to 5 scores.  And then had all 4 colors in 20+ scoring positions by the time we got to the 5th score round.  I had no chance of catching up, having only scored 4 points to her 94.  You live and die by the draw on this game and I died horribly 3 times in a row.  The second game went pretty much the same way, the third we didn't even bother finishing.  I even tried playing how my wife was playing, and it was just sheer luck of the draw that determined the winner in my view.

It's a shame too because I really wanted to like this game.  It's the first time I've actually been tempted to just toss a game in the trash after buying it.

[b]Trambahn[/b] was traded away with Thebes: The Tomb Raiders in a math trade 1/5/16. (Received Triassic Terror)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]While I initially enjoyed my plays of Trambahn I felt like it quickly revealed all it had to offer in terms of strategy. Our games started feeling very samey; in part because the trams always come out in the same order so it is very difficult to build a strategy around the higher multiplier trams which made the game feel like it was on rails without many meaningful decisions to make. Also the number distribution in the deck felt slightly off making for a very luck dependent game, even in regards to other card games. In the end there are so many good card games that use some kind of sequential number play that I'd much rather play one of them [i](Arboretum, Lost Cities and Musee).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Another hit in the Lookout 2p player line [i](which in my opinion has replaced the Kosmos 2p series of games in terms of quality)[/i].
- Relatively small footprint making it a great cafe/pub game.
- The theme is a little dry, but thankfully the choice of art is awesome [i](Lookout used historic illustrations and original art by Klemens Franz)[/i].
- Another new game that builds on Lost Cities and, in my opinion, is a superior game [i]([thing=163056][/thing] and [thing=140934][/thing] being the other two)[/i].
- Multi use cards [i]( cards can be played as currency, train routes or passengers).[/i]
- A very tense hand management game, routes always need to be played in ascending order [i](a la Lost Cities)[/i] and you must have trains you purchased to keep your routes in play .
- Probably the most innovative mechanism in the game is how scoring works.
  In a nut shell you are playing passengers to certain stations and once there are 4 passengers all routes of that color score [i](whether or not you and your opponent have any routes in that color)[/i]. After 10 scoring rounds the game is over, this really keeps the game moving and can really mess you over if you don't get into rhythm with the scoring rounds.[/i]

The first game I decided to buy even though it uses the "Rack-O mechanic".  And I'm glad I bought it, because it's really great!  I especially like two things: 1) the cards have 3 different functions (create passengers, create stations, or use them as money) and you have to carefully decide how to use them. 2) You are going to score 10 times during the game, and again, you (and your opponent) are determining when this is going to happen (and hopefully, each scoring works out better for you than for your opponent).  For such simple rules, it gives a good amount of depth.  Really enjoy it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Based on one play: You draw cards and the place them either as passengers or as routes. Passengers cause scoring and are shared between players. Once there are 4 passengers of a color all routes score of that color. Your routes are individual and have multipliers attached to them. The game has little thought, it is fairly obvious what to play and removes all the decision making of a good train game as your draw and your opponents routes make your choice often really evident.

RATING: 7
Trambahn is a two-player set-collection card game with a train theme. Because it didn't involve any map board or connection elements, it didn't much feel like a "train game" though. The gameplay itself felt a little like Lost Cities--you need to play cards in ascending numerical order, with the higher cards being worth more points. Player-controlled scoring timing is what differentiates this game, as players can play some of their cards to the middle instead of to their sets--four cards of a single color initiate scoring for that color, for both players. In this way, the same colored sets can be scored multiple times during the game. This is a filler-weight game for me, and while it didn't wow me, I wouldn't mind playing more.

A really interesting dueling card game that uses a card in three different ways.  Either as passenger demand, Station improvement for income.  All three you need and the first two you need to use the same cards to improve.  There is also a race as you feel a sense of urgency to get your strong stations scored before your opponent as there are only 10 scorings.  On top of all that you also have a long term goal to get as many 8 card stations as they score additional points.  Sounds complicated but the rules are straight forward and streamlines but the game play is deeper than is seems and satisfying.

2 plays, Origins 2015

Calling this a "train game", it turns out, is a bit of a stretch. Yes, there are pictures of trains and passengers on the card, and the rules use terms like "station", "passenger", "train", and "tour". But those terms largely get in the way of learning the game! It's easier to think about playing cards (which come in 4 different colors of passenger) in rows or columns, with periodic scoring. Maybe I'll try to reapply the theme later....

This is a [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing] style game, but a bit more complicated and with a train theme. You are each playing cards from a shared deck, to your own personal display in columns, in ascending order. Turns are quick, with the main decisions being which cards to discard to rows (to trigger, or approach, scoring) and whether or not to purchase a train (or wait to buy a better one). The game overall is also quick, unlike LC where playing 3 rounds sometimes feels too long.

Unfortunately, the game seemed to lack the tension of [thing=50]Lost Cities[/thing] or [thing=760][/thing] (a much better 2-player card game!). With no risk of your opponent picking up your discards, it seemed as if you're almost playing a solo game just hoping to draw the right cards at the right time. The only real decision was related to your discards (cards played to the rows), since that triggers scoring. But that decision seems pretty obvious: preferentially discard to the color(s) you're ahead in, then to neutral color(s). There is more to think about if you could also play those cards to one of your columns, or if they're numbers are low enough to start a new column of that color (but only if you have enough money to buy a train this turn). But once you've got a mid-high number on top you easily discard unplayable cards. And playing multiple columns of the same color, in a game this quick, doesn't seem advisable. 

I'd like to try this one again, though. It feels like there might be more to this game than seen at first glance?

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
Place the 4 "Endstation" cards between the players, with room for a row of cards next to each. The train deck is stacked with all 2s on top, then 3s, then 4s. Place the top 3 cards in a row next to the deck, everything face up. Shuffle the deck of passengers (each of which has a number -- 2 1s, 2 10s, 3 each 2-9; plus 8 jokers -- and a VP value 0-3), give player 1/2 12/15 in a face down money stack; each gets a hand of 6 cards.

[u]Your Turn[/u]
In order:
1. You must play 1 or 2 cards to the passenger rows (matching color). If a row gets to 4 cards, [u]both[/u] players score (see below), then you discard those 4 cards. The game ends after 10 such "regular" scorings.
2. You may play cards into your personal display, in columns. Each column must be all the same color, and played in ascending order (no duplicates); once the 10 is played to a column, it is locked; you may no longer add to it. The jokers may be played to any unlocked column. If you play the 8th card to a column, a "special" scoring occurs immediately: only [u]you[/u] score (see below), without counting this against the 10-scoring game limit.
3. Add any cards you want to your money pile.
4. You may buy 1+ trains from the face up display, placing each above a different column of cards (max 1 train / column). The 2/3/4 trains each cost 5/10/15. Any columns without a train are then converted to your money pile!
5. Replenish your hand to a size of 6. If the draw deck runs out, both players immediately lose half their money (round down?); then shuffle the discards to create a new deck.

[u]Scoring[/u]
A column scores VP = (train value) x (sum of passenger VP values). Do NOT discard your column cards. Record the VP on a score sheet.

An enjoyable game with a calm start with a buildup to a ending that even though you see the game coming to an end can sneak up on you. The way that the game scores throughout the game feels forgiving and fluid. In Trambahn having the ability to use a card in multiple ways creates stressful choices, it's more about what you will or will not be able to do having discarded or not discarded a given card, you don't have to worry about the card directly helping your opponent. All in all its a solid game that I look forward to playing again. 

VS lost cities:
It's about about trains, it works in positive numbers, and you don't lose points for trains that don't meet a point threshold.

Fast playing game.  While obviously similar to Lost Cities, it is a little more complex.  I'm still trying to wrap my head around the pace of the game.  You really need to react to what your opponents are doing or there is a real risk they will run away with the game before you get going.  It feels like you need to discard liberally to get money for trains.  Finding the right balance of what to discard versus what to save in your hand to play on a future turn is where the game seems to be.

My husband is dubious about this game. After wondering why I had gone through so many cards about midway through, he realized it was because I didn't keep any in my hand and banked every turn while he had been building more 'runs'. He doesn't like games where there is only one strategy to play (whereas I tend to like set collection games and don't get over precious about it). He wants to play again where we both strictly do only one of the strategies to see if it's 'broken' to him.

It's like Lost Cities meets Sushi Go. I found it a little boring. I already have a copy of Sushi Go and it plays more players. So I'll pass on this one.

I think if you want an opinion that is similar to mine, watch Gameboy Geek's video review. He was quite spot on with the assessment.

First, the good. If you like Lost Cities, this is worth a try. If you don't like Lost Cities, I am not sure you are the target audience. That said, I like Lost Cities way better. It is cleaner, simpler and achieve the same satisfaction. Trambahn may not be a bad game, but it was not really fun for us.

Now the pros of the game. There is one major one: there seems to be multiple paths for victory and I have not tried every single method or match up. When you play Trambahn, your strategy may be dictated by what your opponents go for. For example, one clear strategy is to go small ball and buy all the cheap stations off the bat and start your lines immediately. The goal is to score low value points fast and early enough times that the game ends before your opponents can retaliate. This is a viable strategy, but does depend on your opponent not choosing to go down the same route as there are only 5 2x stations. Admittedly, the longer you take to score the routes, the higher the chance you will flame out. The opposing strategy is to take the high value stations and try to get high scoring stations. Even a few high point cards in a x4 will score you loads of points. Other potential strategies include a mixed station tableau, multiple same colored line scoring, etc.   

That said, the game just never felt right between me and my spouse. After several hands, my spouse got disinterested in playing. When asked, she said Lost Cities just was a better game. Wasn't exactly clear why she felt that way. One possibility was that at latter stages of the game where scoring is repetitively triggered, it felt a bit lame. Since there are only 4 colors, it is not hard to pull the color you want. So once the lines are established, you are just hoping to draw the triggering colors you want for a few rounds to score. Since you can play two passengers per turn, it is not hard to constantly trigger scoring rounds. I certainly did that often, perhaps to my wife's frustration. Also, going for high value trams is risky. I often found myself establishing a line way too late for the x4 to be of any value. If this happens often, then it becomes frustrating.

Trambahn may not be a lousy game if both parties are seasoned players with a good grasp of the strategies and counter strategies for each particular type of play. Unfortunately, we will never reach that stage as we have other options. If it doesn't feel fun right off the bat, it will likely languish in our collection.

A very good, low-luck, deep but still quick 2-player game. Reminds me a bit of Lost cities but where lost cities is barely above a roll and move game Trambahn is packed full of meaningful and difficult decisions. Gameflow is focused on early game, early you build the foundation and make a lot of choices while in the endgame you just hope you can score the lines you built better than your opponent.

Theme is pasted up and after two plays it is hard to say... I can play, but this doesn't feel that wonderful. Maybe couple of more plays and different opponent might give a better aspect. A bit Lost Cities -feeling.

Multi-use card draft game depicting tramway routes in 19th century Munich. Cards are used as money, commuters, or tramway routes. I like that you can eliminate cards that help your opponents by converting them to cash. Quick play with set collection. Decent decision making between resources and balancing number of tramways and commuter demand.

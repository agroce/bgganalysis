I like to play this with my son. When I play against my wife, however, we end up using a look ahead strategy  that tends toward AP. Nice light game, overall.

RATING: 7
Comparison to Hey, That's My Fish! is inevitable, but this is different enough and it comes close to the genius of that game when playing with more than two players. The two player game could potentially end prematurely because you can get blocked and be forced to go in torpor while being behind in points. The other player will go in torpor as well and the game is over. Feels like being checkmate'd in 3 moves.

Similar gameplay to Hey, that's my fish! but different enough to own both. This game is less take that but still requires thoughtfull planning and calculating if it's still worth moving around in the end game

RATING: 5
Comparison to Pingvinas(Hey that's my Fish) is inevitable. After 2 plays of Sugar Gliders, I think I prefer Pingvinas because the board is shrinking and there is very interesting aspects of "cut off the area" which this game doesn't have.

It is just too easy to pick up high-point tiles and easy to find the best routes with some thoughts. There maybe some first-player advantage (I am not convinced either way. Many players I played with say there is).

Over all, it is not a bad game but it just doesn't have strong charm for me to come back to play it regularly.

This is actually an abstract game and I'm not the abstract player.
But the game reminds me of Hey, that's my fish and I love that. So, this game will come often on our table.

Pros:
* Works great with 2
* Quick setup and cleanup (especially on the 2p side of the board)
* Fun puzzle solving
* Fun amount of player interaction.
* Very quick turns.
* Cute with very nice components. My wife loved the theme.

Cons:
* Not easily available in the US (yet).
* In one of our plays, a player got "stuck" where  every pattern of moves for the next three turns had her jumping from empty space to empty space. This was still pretty early in the game so there were tons of point tiles still out. We hope this is one of those 1-in-a-1000 situations, but it also reinforced the importance of picking up point tiles of every value to make sure you have lots of flexibility if you ever get into a barren part of the board.

Overall:
* An excellent filler
* Great 2 player game (haven't tried it with more)

Better than HTMF by a long shot for us. Played 5 2p games so far. Because point tiles are also used to enable movement, we especially like that the game isn't just a race to pick up all of the highest valued tiles. In many situations 1's and 2's are more useful than a 3 or 4.

Initial rating 7.

A simpler, boring version of Hey, that's my fish!

RATING: 6
06-09-2015. Rated after 2 plays. Sugar Gliders is an ok game. You are a sugar glider in a tree, made up of tiles with different values. From each tile, you move in a straight line as many spaces as  on the tile and score the tile you departed from as points.

Game is similar to Hey,  that's my Fish but that game offers more depth. I don't see why you'd own both or prefer Sugar Gliders over Hey, That's my Fish unless you want a family version of it.

RATING: 5.5
Each player controls a sugar glider collecting fruit tokens on a conveniently hexagonal tree. Each fruit is numbered 1-5, signifying both end-game points and the number of spaces, in a straight line, the glider can move next.

Like many simple abstracts, it works as a very quick filler with casual players -- down to 5-10 minutes with two players -- but with a little more concentration allows for as much [-]analysis paralysis[/-]lookahead as desired. 

The biggest problem is that play can feel somewhat scripted: it is too easy to simply pick the highest-numbered fruit you can reach. It needs more concentration than that to be worth playing at all, because the most interesting aspect is the interaction that comes from nastily blocking other players' jumps. Even then I don't find it particularly rewarding; play is free enough that blocking is more likely to mean the opponent loses one or two points than suffers any interesting consequences. 

Not a bad game but not one I would miss.

tl;dr: like [thing=8203][/thing], but not as brutal

Jump around from tile to tile. Pick up the tiles you start from. The difference is that in this game your distance is determined by the amount of fish on the starting tile. Another big difference is that you can also go where there are no tiles, but you don't get any points on your next turn as there is no tile to pick up.
It's a nice variation on the concept and I didn't mind playing it, but these kinds of games will never be my favorites.

This is an excellent family game, because there is enough gamer satisfaction in here to keep them interested, but its mechanisms are simple enough for young children to play along — perhaps even competitively, depending on their aptitude for strategy and grasp or intuition of the fruit values.  The theme is a spectacular fit for this abstract game:  I [b]love[/b] the torpor mechanism.  Yes, you will always see it get used at the end of the game, but it's those small uses for it (short naps) in the middle of the game that make me adore it.

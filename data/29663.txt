I tried hard to like SFB, with it's plots and power allocations. The way different weapons systems work and the ship displays make it look like you have a starship at your fingertips and a world of thrilling space combat awaits.

Sadly you don't and it doesn't. Winning a game of Star Fleet Battles feels like coming top in a four-hour accountancy exam. Losing a game feels like failing a four-hour accountancy exam. Neither of which endears a game to me.

RATING: 7
The classic game of Star Trek starship combat. Not as complex as some would have you believe. Sure, there's a lot of rules available, but most games will not use 70% of them. The Basic Set is a very enjoyable game in and of itself. The game becomes a lot more accessible if you can find someone to teach you; it's not nearly as difficult in execution as it is in explanation. If you're interested in this, I'd say look at Federation Commander first.

RATING: 7.5
This game is extremely dry, it's ridiculously over-complex by modern standards, and it takes far too long to play. But I love it so. I've never played anything like it. The different factions are extremely different from each other, and even within the same faction the various ship classes and specs lead to a staggering variety of gameplay. For example, Klingons have highly maneuverable ships, which leads to an exquisite dance of weapon arcs, speed, and vulnerability. By comparison the Federation's "great mace in the face" photon torpedo armed ships are like bulls desperately trying to line up a killing gore on the smaller wolves that harass them. And yet it is the Klingons, not the Feds, who actually field a full-on battleship, seemingly turning the tables in those engagements where it is present. When you add the submariner Romulans, live-fast-die-young Orions, noble Hydrans, Kzinti, Lyrans, Tholians, Andromedans, and others it means that every player can have a favorite that is extremely different from their friends' and yet balanced. The game includes boarding parties, "hero" caliber crewmen, fleet operations, as many different scenarios as you can imagine, and a timeline that spans practically from Armstrong to Kirk and beyond.

I still have a good 8' of shelf space devoted to this game, and yet I wonder if I'll be able to play it. Perhaps it was a perfect game for my college and post-college years, when I had more time and gamer friends than I had obligations. Maybe I can convince one of my buddies to run a scenario with me. Just a nice, simple duel...

Bought.

One of the two best starship combat games I have ever played. Slightly too complex - its dangerously close to ASL territory. Started playing in Austin TX and Corpus Christie in the early 1980's and upgraded to the binder rule books and Commanders SSDs when I started playing again in 1996. Never had many opponents at that time however. Stopped buying the game when ADB started making minute changes to SSDs and issuing entirely new versions of the SSD books which were required for tournament play.

I go way back with SFB.  (I had the first edition when I was in high school, but it's long since vanished into the mists of time.)  I have very mixed feelings about the game.  I love its core, but I'm far less crazy about some of the directions the designers took later on.  Haven't played this in years.  Federation Commander looks [i]very[/i] appealing, though...

RATING: 7
One of the best tactical board games ever made that has sadly been left behind in the modern world. I haven't had the game on the table in years. 

The basic set is enough of a game on its own. I always wanted to pick up Advanced Missions, but lack of time and opponents means I likely never will.

A rating of '7' might seem a little high, but I'm giving this game a high rating for a specific reason: It has -by far- the best indexed and organized manual I've ever seen. If you spend more than 20 seconds looking for a rule in the multi-hundred page manual, you're doing something wrong. This is essential in a game as complex as SFB which is going to result in multiple rules lookups during play.

  The simultaneous movement is a gorgeous system. Yeah, the rules are dense and the book awfully thick, but when it comes down to it once you get a few basic systems mastered you can really get a taste for the full meat of the game.
   One downside is because there is so much book-keeping it's really not practical to play more than one ship, but in a game this dense it's hard to get more than one player. 
   Wish I could play it more.

An incredible amount of game in a small box.  The rules are harder to articulate than they are to play.  Real game balance requires the mid-turn speed changes, erratic maneuvers, and special drones from advanced missions.  Other than that, you can stick with this one box for over thirty game sessions and have a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good fun with the right group.  Best moment came 2 hours into a 4 player game when my Klingon fleet finally manuvered into perfect position on the Feds and the massed disruptor volley netted something like 3 disruptors hitting out of 20+ total.  We immediately instituted the "Klingon ships immedidately self-destruct out of embarassment" house rule that lasted 2 years.

Definitely not for everyone. However, despite the length of the rules, you can teach someone how to play in under 10 minutes; you don't need all the complex stuff (tractors, transporters, etc.) to have a fun game of just flying around and trying to blow the crap out of one another. The detail, however, leads to a great many tactics and scenarios possible. I've never gotten tired of this game.

Very heavy game.  Really.  But when you have a grip of the rules, it can be very fullfiling to play with friends.  Mind you, learning the rules is like trying to have a lawer degree at home.  Once past this heavy learning curve, you see the beauty and the attention to detail of this intensely tactical wargame.

Having all the extension possible to play, I can vouch that it is indeed a complete game that will cater to a very niche crowd, but that niche crowd is really existing.  This game got an 8 for the sheer amount of time a game take.  But when we DO play the game, it's a solid 9

[floatleft][ImageID=411659][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
Star Fleet Battles (SFB) is a relatively new game to my library and I am totally smitten with it. The impulse system is totally unique, engaging, and compelling. 

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
When I was first introduced to SFB I was perplexed at how people could find a game with so much bookkeeping to be interesting. After experiencing the game first hand, I was shocked at how amazing the game felt and how incredible the design is for being over 30 years old.

The luxury of having someone teach me SFB definitely helped my love for this game. We were up and playing a simple game after about 15-20 minutes of rules explanation. This is remarkable for a wargame. If I were to try to learn this game on my own I doubt that I would have even played it. The rule book is cumbersome because it answers every conceivable question but at the heart of the game is a very simple design. Not every rule has to be included for a first game. As players begin to master the basics, they can add in more rules and more tactical options to their arsenal.

I can easily see this becoming a 10 for me.

Last played in 1994 during a 2-player game.  1 hour per turn.  The game lasted 10-12 turns, I think.

Although a good, detailed game, I'm to old for that much detail now.

The beauty of a complicated game is its thoroughness. This game 'replicates' nearly everything you'd expect in starship combat. It can be played as simply or as complicated as you desire.

Why I purchased: Old flame
Where purchased: Ebay

Back in the day, We had a gamestore about a block from my house. I got to play SFB and Traveller and many many wargames. I got to role-play Bushido, Morrow Project and Villians & Vigilantes and...well you get the idea, we played a lot of games. One of my very first jobs was restocking a game store. The staff paid me in games! Life was good.

One of the few 'old-time' wargames still going, which should say something about the underlying solidity of the design right there.

As a 'game system', the rules are long, complex -- and dedicated to giving the player as many options as possible.  At its base, it is still a game of maneuver, and that is the continuing appeal of this game.

The Basic Set itself provides a good foundation with rules for almost everything you can reasonably ask for. With just this, the selection of ships is solid, but limited outside of the Federation and Klingons. If you have this, and enjoy it, I do recommend Advanced Missions and C1 as the "essential" SFB.

A very good game. The base set gives you pretty much the whole game - nothing else required (but it makes it better). 

The complexity is over-hyped, and the big, scary rulebook could easily be condensed to half its size at least (at a cost of clarity). For a Trekkie, this is a wonderful project.

RATING: 10
This game hits on all cylinders for me. I LOVE Damage Allocation and SSD's. Maybe I'm a micro-manager at heart. Sure if you don't care for the theme and dislike book keeping it can be very tedious, but for those people who it clicks with, it really clicks. It's important to play with people you trust or don't know you can't trust yet, as there is alot of opportunity for cheating.

I enjoy comapring and contrasting the seemingly endless varities of ships and weapons systems and how they all interact, especially historically between traditional foes.  It's just a rich gaming experience.

I find it best plays as scenarios or with small (3 ship or less) head to head fights. I've always wanted to play the full war campaign, I forget what it's called, but it is truly epic in scope and grandeur.

RATING: 5
As a kid, Star Fleet Battles was pure imagination juice and one of the most intense games I had ever played. The impulse system makes ship movement feel almost like it's happening in real time and the varying ranges among the primary weapon systems of the capital ships added a ton of tension. The basic system is an all-time classic of game design. At some point though, SFB crossed over from game to simulation. The sheer amount of content that has been added to the system over the years is almost ludicrous. The dense rulebook collapsed under its own weight quite a while ago.

Even with the most basic rules however, Star Fleet Battles still takes a long time. As much as I love the design, this is clearly a game from another era. I don't have the time or the patience for a two hour ship duel like I did in the pre-electronic age. Star Fleet Battles is more or less a fond piece of nostalgia for me, rather than a viable game.

My personal favorite game of all time.  Most of the basics have been covered in other reviews or articles, so my comments I'll limit to opinion.  The *reason* I like the game so much is both in how perfectly balanced it is, and how well thought out the universe is.  No plot holes in the history of the SFU (*cough*like franchise Trek*cough*), no technobabble explanations for things or 'technology of the week' devices that only show up once.  The technology balance of the races is perfectly level, and the assigned "point value" of the ships allowing pick-up games is accurate (IE., matched fleets of similar ships equal in point value WILL be a balanced game).  The game is internally consistent, balanced, and FUN.  Most impressively, the game doesn't feel "gimmicky" - the technology present works in a logical way consistent with the universe.  Transporters, for example.  No evil clones or curing diseases or restoring aging or any such nonsense.  These are warships, the transporters can beam over troops to enemy ships to try and take them over, or for hit-and-run raids with explosives to take out key systems.  They can beam "mines" into space, and can be used for moving cargo.

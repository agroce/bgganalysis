RATING: 8
A game that clearly shows its Gipf series parentage.  It reminds me most of Dvonn in its stacking of pieces with the aim to have yours on top, and in its rapidly diminishing options.  However, in Lyngk all pieces start neutral and the game poses tricky questions about which two colours you will claim as your own and, almost as importantly, when.  Pieces of a claimed colour are more powerful in terms of stacking and are able to make use of Lyngk moves, but there are also advantages in waiting to see how the game develops.  All of this, plus the worry that your opponent might claim the colour you are eyeing first, creates a nice tension.  The requirement for each piece in a stack to be a different colour means that sequences of moves must be carefully planned and opportunities for blocking abound.  An intriguing game and, I can only hope, not the epilogue to the Gipf series that it is billed as.

Production quality is good.  The box is much bigger than necessary.  I have thrown away the insert and made a home for two other abstracts.  There is room for yet more.  The colouring of the pieces departs from the austere tones of other Gipf titles, but, on the plus side, the composition of a stack can be seen at a glance. The rules are clearly written.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This actually does feel like an ever so slightly modernized, more contemporary version of a GIPF game.  It is more colorful, has a tangential more gamery "claim a color now or later" mechanic, and curiously, throws in a bounce off your own colors curve ball idea for good measure.  Does it come together and work?  I would say yes.  The result was fun to think about and fun to play.  Likely my favorite of the series.

After about 15 plays, this game has become my favorite Gipf game and one of my favorite games ever.

Control through stack dynamics, the strategically key trade-off of flexibility for mobility when claiming a color, the shared options of neutral pieces, and the direction of play-influencing Lyngk rule makes for a fascinatingly layered and complex experience.

Some have said they don't make use of the "lyngk rule" frequently, but I can't imagine that because this rule seems to be central to valuing pieces in the early game. The added mobility seems critical in deciding which neutral colors to move in the opening and which color to claim first.

The stack dynamics provide fascinating blocking options. There is a trade-off and timing to claiming a color, adding strength and mobility at the expense of flexibility and additionally potentially blocking moves your opponent could make. I thought claiming colors would be a peripheral matter to the strategy, but it's actually a very central and compelling component. Additionally, that one color remains movable to both players for the whole game adds yet another interesting layer of options.

Highly recommended!

Burm is my all time favourite abstract designer. Dvonn and Yinsh are in my top ten favourites of all time. Never expected an addition to the Gipf series, so this is a very welcomed surprise.

Based on initial 2 plays, published Polish rules and a homemade copy on January 20, 2017:

Lyngk is a combo of Dvonn, Tzaar, with a hint of Yinsh's movement thrown in. 

The most interesting mechanics are:
1) the timing of when to claim a colour
2) the mechanics of the Lyngk principle, which unleashes interesting movement possibilities

While Lyngk seems very accessible, it is one of the lightest of the series. It doesn't seem to have the heft of the top tier games. Games usually end in tie breakers as best moves are more obvious/less opaque than others in the project. 

For me personally, my top favourites are still Dvonn and Yinsh and Tzaar. Then Lyngk is middle tier along with Zertz. The bottom tier are Punct, Gipf and Tamsk.

Up there with the best of the GIPF series. The claiming of colors is new for these but echoes the commitment one makes in TZAAR. Lunges are key for maxing your stacks without getting nailed by an enemy singleton. That means creating stacks or keeping central pieces to linknoff of.

Perhaps I would have rated this higher years ago. As it says in the rules, this is like an umbrella for the GIPF series. As such, it's lacking anything that feels really fresh to people who have played the games in the series. I'm not sure I'd rather play this than any of the others, but I am enjoying it right now. But I'm not sure it's memorable enough to leave a lasting imprint.

I've played the prototype a couple of times and really enjoy it. Elements of the game feel well-known by the other games of the Gipf Project, while the overall game feels fresh and new. When played against gamers on a similar level, it's an incredibly tight game. But it's also easily accessible for non-experienced players as the rules are easy to grasp.

This feels more like a re-hashing than an apotheosis of the earlier gipf games, and it does not work as well for me as the simpler (and less colorful) Dvonn and Tzaar. The game's signature Lyngk move is difficult to execute well, and, without it, you're really just riffing in a somewhat interesting way on the familiar gipf stacking and movement tropes.

RATING: 8
Supposedly a synthesis of the other games in the series - and I can just about see the connections although the reference to Punct is tenuous.

The gameplay itself is up to the standard of the rest of the Gipf games so no complaints about that.  However in terms of the production - 

> The box is too big and a different size to any of the other games in the series - boo hiss. Loses a rating mark because of the box.
> I would prefer the boards to be done in cloth or canvas as it would allow for a smaller box and would stop pieces sliding around.
> The playing pieces are the same clunky-chunky and funky faux bakelite as normal so that's good but I don't much care for the choice of green/red/blue - a little garish and doesn't fit with the aesthetic.

First world problems to be sure. I would love a combined set of the whole Gipf series to be produced which folded into a travel pouch (with the pouch folding out to be a cloth board.

After having played YINSH, I knew immediately that the GIPF Project was something I needed to get in on. While, to this day, I have still only been able to play YINSH, when I heard that LYNGK had been released as a prologue to the series, I had to get a copy.

After having played around 5 matches, I am delighted. The depth of strategy is on-par with my experience with YINSH, and the added colour of LYNGK gives it a far more powerful table presence. I'm still working on the strategy, but it seems to be up to par with the high levels that players expect from anything GIPF.

Nominee: Unnecessarily Oversized Box Hall of Fame. Seriously, it's way too big for a board and some discs.

I may mock up a vinyl or mouse pad version of the board for a more travel-friendly game.

I've played Yinsh and maybe Gipf back in the early aughts so I don't have a lot of comparisons to draw. However, I love Lyngk! The rules are simple but the possibilities, especially in the mid-game, are staggering. The way you can ping off claimed pieces makes your brain hurt in a really good way. And your done with a game in 15-20 minutes max! 

My only complaint is the game could fit into a box half or even a quarter its size if the board were smaller.

Three plays. It's a short game in terms of the number of moves you're going to make before the end (34 max for both players?), but more than any of the other entries in the Gipf Project you need to be thinking hard and looking ahead right from the get-go. I have a feeling that this one is pretty deep, and that there are a lot of tactics to learn.

Choosing two colors during the game is kind of novel, but it's basically a way to balance the random setup, and it seems players should choose pretty soon. The game admittedly uses a set of old mechanics seen before in the series (stacking, capture, straight line moves), as a way to finish it properly, but it just feels tired at this point.

I have a hard time seeing Lyngk as the synthesis of the earlier Gipf games, if only because the "claim a colour when its value reaches a breaking point" mechanism is so dominant. So far as I can see, a good basic strategy is to claim if and only if you can make a stack; it may be that if both players stall long enough, the game will reach an interesting state with cascading claims, blocking and stacking. The 6-stack variant seems to produce a much different game, turbocharging the volatility of tall stacks and claims.

Hmmm, valójában ez a 10-es értékelés összességében szól a GIPF sorozatnak. Az előző játékok megismerése után sok idő telt el a LYNGK megismeréséig, sok új játékot, mechanikát ismertem meg, és erre már nehezen mondanám azt, hogy hű, de letaglózott az újszerűsége, de az absztrakt elegancia itt is teljesen érvényesül. Nagyon élvezetes, gyors, kellemes felfedezési elményt nyújt, amikor örülsz, hogy lenyúltad más tornyát, de aztán kitisztul, hogy igenám, de abból ötös torony már nem lesz... Szóval finom... Az árát viszont inkább nem minősítem... az X éve beszerezhetetlen TAMSK került kb. ennyibe, ami a felhasznált anyagok mennyiségét, minőségét, és magát a ritkaságát tekintetbe véve is más kategória... Elvileg. :)

7 plays in: the physical presentation is beautiful. The game is dense with information and it's hard to read the board, even worse than it's also-dense predecessor TZAAR. LYNGK is the most baroque game in the GIPF series. My impression so far is that it fails to match the elegance and coherent logic of its predecessors. It feels messy to me, both conceptually and visually. In fact it's the only GIPF game I haven't fallen for.

After a few plays, I like the game. I’ve been thinking about it quite a bit afterward (always a good thing), wondering about the strategies for when to claim a color, how to move pieces/stacks in order to line up “Lyngks” for yourself and/or mess with your opponent, and what to do with the six weird starting spots off the main hex. I find that I like the rule that keeps neutral pieces weak (cannot move onto taller stacks) and claimed pieces strong (can move onto any stacks as long as the color rule is observed). Looking forward to more plays.

EDIT: The 6-stack variant is implemented on Little Golem. It's quite a different game, and I don't like it as much as the standard version.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I'm going to have to stop saying I don't like abstracts, I've really enjoyed the recent abstracts I've been playing and LYNGK may end up becoming my favorite. I'm not going to explain the rules except to say they are the perfect combination of being easy to learn and packed with deep, strategic decision making. You need to think and plan ahead, but I still missed moves my opponent could make due to the linking rule [i](which allows you to potentially move pieces all over the board)[/i]  LYNGK is a design that could be prone to severe AP if you analyze each possible move; personally I'd rather play a bit looser and enjoy the game without over analyzing the board state. That, of course, is personal preference.  

I've now also played YINSH and it seems to be regarded as the best in the series I enjoyed the puzzle presented in LYNGK much more. What put it over the edge for me is that you don't start the game with certain colors and one of the decisions you need to make in the game is when to claim a color (each player will choose two of the five). That decision adds another layer of depth to the game.

Needless to say LYNGK has been the surprise of the month for me; in fact I ended up ordering a copy right after I played. I really enjoy how LYNGK stretches my brain while trying to solve a complex spacial puzzle and my kids enjoy checkers, so I think this will be a fun alternative.[/i]

I rarely have the analytical self-discipline required for abstracts, but I do like the GIPF series, for which LYNGK is the latest addition. Make stacks of five different coloured pieces and - if tied - have the most of the next highest numbered stack(s). There's a small PYL element in choosing which colours you want to play and the titular move (not well explained in the rules, we thought) allows for some visionary play.

My first play of LYNGK gave me the same brain-tickling sensations of YINSH, in that there was a decision space that provided the opportunity to for clean, clever maneuvers. LYNGK just did not feel -quite- as clever as its cousin. Maybe I am fortunate in having not sampled the rest of the GIPF titles aside those two, because I may be underwhelmed if LYNGK did not add any particularly outstanding mechanisms.

Pretty clever, a little hard to tell what colors are already in your stack sometimes, but not too bad. Probably not a great game for colorblind players, though.

Allows you to make some big, unexpected moves by jumping from claimed tile to claimed tile, or moving tiles into place to leap on top of the stack of tiles your opponent worked to get (sometimes to only have it taken right back from you). Only played it a couple of times, but really enjoyed it so far.

Boy, I'm not sure about this one. 5 plays in and I'm still not sure what I'm doing wrong. This might finally resolve itself at 10 plays, but the best GIPF games don't take that long to get into.

At the very least, I like it more than ZERTZ.

Superb addition to the GIPF series. It belongs to the subset of GIPF games where every move shrinks the number of active pieces (like DVONN and TZAAR). When to choose ones colours is very intriguing (and nailbiting).  The LYNGK rule adds a lot to the game. It is the prettiest of the GIPF games.

The timing of when to choose your colors is really compelling, as there are trade offs between the benefits of owning a color vs remaining uncommitted. The LYNGK rule really adds a layer of depth to color evaluation and board positioning; what a fascinating game! This has a real chance at dethroning TZAAR as my favorite game in the series; LYNGK really speaks to my sensibilities and I find myself wanting to play all the time.

My second favorite of Burm's GIPF series. The "chicken" quality as to when you choose your colour creates a wonderful tension.

[EDIT after 8 plays]
raised rating from 7.8 to 8.
Still complaining about the scarse readability of the board, but the game itself, beside being an AP-prone brainburner, is very exciting and physically demanding.


[after only 2 games]
it's good, it's fun, it's interesting but it's not as refined, elegant and perfect as Tzaar or Yinsh.
The beginning of the game is total chaos, it's just aimless and random.
After a while, someone grabs a color and the real game begins.
It's a very very tough brainburner and possible (and /or correct) moves aren't easily visible. The board is not easily readable.
I absolutely suggest to buy it but... it's not the best GIPF game around, so far.

cant wait for this one. My daughter who loves these games saw a pic and said 'Oh rainbow Yinsh"

One of my two favorites in GIPF Project, right up there with ZERTZ.

Don't let the rulebook fool you: This game has very simple rules, which provide emergent excellent, strategic gameplay. Just. Awesome.

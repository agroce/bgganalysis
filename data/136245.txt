A game for kids where one child tries - under time pressure - to build towers while other children try to knock them down - tears and broken game pieces result.

Dexterity game which seemed completely random and pointless to me. I'm clearly not the target audience, but my kid was also not interested.

And get ready to look for those flying pieces!

Vous adorez les jeux de construction ? de patience ? de minutie ? Ou chaque pièce installée est une victoire pour vous ? NE JOUEZ PAS PAS A CE JEU ! Car pendant que vous essayerez de faire votre construction parfaite, les autres joueurs utiliseront leur catapulte pour détruire votre merveille architecturale. Frustrant, non ?

What a fun quick filler dex game. Flip a egg timer someone tries to build towers while others fling dice at the tower. If it's left standing after the timer runs out they get to keep the card they built the tower pattern on and it's worth 3-16. End game is 16 points.

Anyone who giggles when they hear the premise of this game can expect to keep laughing while they play. Anyone who doesn't is possibly a bore you can stop gaming with, or else they are concerned with sensible stuff like "how many times can you really play that before you get sick of it?" or they have easily-injured hands or something.

How my! I can't imagine a game that could surpass this one when you talk about "fun games". We just can't stop laughing during the whole time while we try to hit the fragile constructions the active player is trying to build.

Here's the problem: You can't officially block saboteurs from destroying your tower, but in effect... you kinda always do.

RATING: 6.6
Here's a silly little build-em-up/knock-em-down game that allows all players to play at the same time (one building towers and the others trying to knock them down).  It overstays its welcome just a little bit and some people can get upset when they finish building a tower just to have everyone come at them all at once.  However, should you go into with the understanding that it's all very silly and lucky, nobody should end the game with hurt feelings...maybe a couple hurt knuckles though depending on where those dice land!

A really fun idea for a game that just didn't come together for me. The dice end up flying all over, and my OCD nature fears they will get lost. It also seems really easy to destroy and very hard to build, so it is a bit of a frustrating experience. But I should play a bit more to see if my opinion changes.

I'm glad that Florence Fraga is credited as a designer here as well. She is a wonderful lady.

RATING: 8.5
Blue Orange (and Fraga) made a good choice removing the "earthquake" mechanic, which (1) rewarded physical strength and (2) could surely level all towers.

I like that the catapults' launch angle rewards finesse instead of sheer power (unlike flicking games).

All painted wood components (nothing plastic besides the sand timer) is a nice touch.  I was surprised the ammo dice are not plastic.

Plays well at any player count, though fewer players means more ammo dice per saboteur (9 total ammo).

Huge hit with my casual play group, probably our new favorite filler game.  Have only had 1 new player dislike the game (too stressful with the short timer) and 1 new player lukewarm (displeased with lack of success).

RATING: 5.5
Players build structures while all the other players catapult dice, trying to knock them down. When the timer goes off you get points for the completed structures standing, based on their difficulty (shown on the board tiles). 

I like that everyone's playing every turn. Chaotic fun but it can certainly be gamed. With 3+ players there's really very little chance any of the structures you begin building early on will remain standing. It's all about bleeding dice and hoping you can quickly cobble something together during the final seconds.

My 10-year old would totally love this game. Using the catapult to shoot down towers as they are being built would excite and delight him. A very light dexterity game with nice bits.

Well, it's no secret I'm a sucker for dexterity games. Often a fan of real-time games, as well. Love the art on this one. Very difficult for both sides, but it's a good kind of challenge.

Jogo que prometia pouco, mas que acabou por proporcionar grande diversão, o qual até se assemelha com uma batalha campal, pois o mais provável é reinar o caos e ninguém conseguir fazer prevalecer as suas intenções. Os componentes são bons, a arte é a possível para um jogo desta natureza e a jogabilidade é simples e fluída. Atenção: Pode ser necessário usar um capacete enquanto joga!

The game may be too spiteful for children but it works quite well as a fun "take-that" filler for adults.

RATING: 4.5
Real time dexterity game. One person tries to build towers out of wooden bricks, other player shoot at them with their catapults. Uhm, that's the game. All of it. Oh right, sometimes you can hit the table. 

Playing with adults (evil bastards) some strategies were invented - one was to build something you don't really want so that people lose their ammunition and then build what you want. The other one was to build close to yourself (further from other players). And think towers were sometimes really hard to hit. Oh and build a tower close to you first, then reach over it and build one in the middle of the table:
[i]"hey your hands shouldn't block dice!" 
"I can't build otherwise" 
"Riiight"[/i]

It's completely stupid, but as a builder you still try to think on your feet, think of back up plans, stay optimistic, it will work out, stay opti... F***! 

Just try to stay in relaxed, goofy atmosphere and you should be ok. Playing in public venues not recommended (dice fly everywhere - the game could include some 4 extra ones).

More fun in concept than in practice. I love the catapult and the gorilla slam, but the actual gameplay in how you are earning points vs. timing other player's dice leaves something to be desired.  Still it is good enough and I'd totally play it again.

Fun ideas and components - it's a good time if you don't take it too seriously.  And that's hard to do when people are flinging blocks at you while you're trying to build a structure. :)

This was a fun time. It's like Make N Break meets Rampage, as you're building some towers in rapid fashion while people are firing against you. I'd like to play a couple more times to see how well it would hold up to repeated play.

Kaboom is a timed physical dexterity game where one player attempts to build structures and all the other players try to knock them down by catapulting dice at them. Real-time and dexterity are two of my least favorite mechanisms in games, so I wasn't sure what to expect from this one.

The supposed premise of the game is that there will be crazy fun to be had from the chaos that results as multiple people knock down things the master builder is trying to build. And I suppose that would be fun. Except that's not what happened in our play.

What happened was even more amusing to me. Four of us took turns trying to catapult dice into the master builder's structures. And for 3/4ths of the game not a single person managed to hit anything. Every shot I made either went way over everything or fell far too short. The master builder strategy shifted to "build as much as you can... nothing will ever fall!".

One player decided to go for the instant win building. All the catapulters just watched him build it, waiting for him to complete his masterpiece before we tore it down. As it turned out no shots were needed because his architectural prowess failed utterly. I think he attempted to rebuild it and someone might have actually scored a hit on it (maybe the one and only hit in the game?)

This seems like my kind of game, but once I actually played it, I realized it wasn't quite there.  I like the idea of trying to build something while under the barrage of catapulted dice (and I REALLY like the "Hulk Smash!" rule in the game), but it seems like your best bet is to wait until the end of your time to build the simpler structures, since anything larger is just going to get knocked down (or not built) before you can score it.  I might like it better if you could score it as soon as you build the structure.

Tolles Kartenspiel, sehr originelle Mechanismen. Schön gestaltete Karten, flüssiger Ablauf, keine Langeweile, da die Züge der anderen für einen immer relevant sind. Flotte Spieldauer, spannend bis zum Schluss. Hoher Wiederspielreiz. 
Ein kleines Spiel-Juwel, leider unverständlicherweise etwas untergegangen. Toll, wie man aus so wenig Karten (es gibt nur 5 Karten-Grundtypen, 2 davon jeweil in vier Sorten, aber ohne Sonderfunktionen, also wirklich nur 5 Kartenfunktionen insgesamt) soviel interessantes Spiel machen kann.

RATING: 6
Play a card, draw a card. That is the flow of the game. It is funny how after playing you have very little to no recollection what happened during the game. What was the decisive moment? This might be because the changes to your position come in very small increments and no single play seems to decide the game. It is the small gains over the course of the game that separate the winners from the rest. 

Rapa Nui is an ok seize the opportunity style of game. You can have a strategy if you decide to concentrate on on single resource/card type and this might well be the best way to play. So it is not only about living the moment but some planning ahead will benefit you as well.

The game has a certain charm, plenty of different routes to victory, all in a brisk playing time. Two good mechanisms: scoring cards triggered by the card *under* the one you draw to refill; and the tensions between keeping scoring cards and seeding the centre with them to make sure your remaining ones score well. But perhaps just slightly too many variables to consider for a fast playing card game?

You try to collect sets of cards of the kind more offered to the moai to score.  It works fine, and offers some thinking, but nothing really special.
UPDATE: After some plays in Yucata, it did go up.  It has engaged me.  Great little gem.

«This is a cheap but first-rate card game: you’ll like it!»
When I was told so as an invite to join a Rapa Nui game, I got scared: the tastes of the dear friend who said that are the opposite of mine, in that he loves mechanics (and wooden cubes) above theme (and plastic miniatures). But once in a while there’s a game that, for different reasons, we both seem to enjoy: Rapa Nui surely isn’t that game.

As it looked like before playing, the theme here is poor at best: during the game - which is quite fast but not fast enough - players let things happen by playing scantly-flavoured cards and then collect resources, which in the end turn out to be nothing else than a fiddly system to assign victory points. 

As my thumb rule warns, never play a game with a geographical name in its title.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
After a 2-players game, this looks as a quite good game. I'm wanting to try with 3 players too see if it's better or not.

One of the best strictly card games for a while, way better than others that are better ranked, Rapa Nui has gave me back my faith in Klaus-Jürgen Wrede unfairly awarded as being an one game designer.

My main complain could be that there is some luck in the cards that are being taken from the deck, I mean, if you bet for one kind of gatherer at the very beginning and then he or she doesn't appear for a while it's hard to collect that kind of good, same occurs with lumberjacks if they doesn't appear it will be hard to build Moais...
 
But always you can keep trying other things and adapt to the situation constantly.

*update*

Having played it 30 times at www.yucata.de and sadly only 4 times face 2 face, I only can say that I love this game, every game develops in a different way, the way sacrifice rounds determine the value of resources is brilliance.

I have to raise my rating because this game really hits my sweet spot in medium weight euros: 

- 40 minutes playing time.
- easy rules.
- hard decisions.

A really nice card game that combines typical Euro resource management and VP engine building with an element of gambling that makes things interesting. Investments in the Moais are essential but not the ultimate determinant of the winner: priests can be very powerful, and wood itself can make the difference between first and second place.

I picked this one up on Yucata, and although the rules were a bit challenging, the gameplay made perfect sense once you got into it.  The basic idea here is that you "invest" in various roles in your tribe - fishermen, priests, etc.  When you have a majority in one type, you get a bonus every time that resource is distributed.  It also gives you a discount on purchasing those items from the "bank."

Resources are distributed at the end of every turn, because the last card revealed in the tableau is the score card.  This adds some real strategy as to what cards you take, and in what order.  The other unique card is the Maoi statue, which triggers a sacrificial round.  Each player adds resource cards to the stone, increasing the value of that card type during the game's final "payoff."  And the player that initiated the Maoi gets to choose another secret resource to add from the "bank."

Notice my use of financial terms - this is at its heart a stock market game, but the theme has been laid on top in a way that works OK, but others will call it pasted on.  That being said, I find it to be fast, satisfying, and scales well from 2 to 4 players.  I'm not sure if I need to buy it yet, but I wouldn't turn down an offer to play.

Not my kind of game. My rating suffered further because tracking information which later becomes hidden is immensely important in the official game. I hate all HTI (see my profile) and I hate HTI which is so crucial for the game with a vengeance. I'd rate the version on Yucata.de considerably better (with a 4.5), because it doesn't have HTI, it always shows you all Sacrifice Cards and Rapa-Nui-Cards.

Players are tribes on Easter Island, building an economy in order to amass victory points.  Clean playing card drafting game, that feels refreshingly original.  Players must play 1-3 cards from their hand into their tableau, building their economic potential, then refill their hand from a public grid of cards.   The trick here is the card they reveal and leave in the grid triggers a payout for all players, including a bonus for the majority holder.  So the cards you want to draft may reveal a juicy card that benefits your opponent!

The other neat thing is when players build a Moai, every player commits a sacrifice card into a pile, with the builder getting to add two cards.  At the end of the game this pile is sorted and more points are paid out based on sacrifice cards the players are still holding.  

Simple game, but very clever, with several strategies to try out.

Takes a bit of getting used to because it combines a few innovative mechanics. However, this mainly applies if you learn it from the rulebook.

Even though there are not many components, the game provides many different starting setups and many paths to victory. Played it a ton and still not sure I'm using an optimal strategy.

Rapa Nui looks like a card drafting and tableau-building game at first sight. While that first impression isn't wrong it really revolves around the imperfect information "stock market" of sacrifices. It's a game with pleasantly simple rules and easy gameplay, yet still doesn't feel shallow or obvious. I'd rate it a little higher with three players but suspect it would not work as well with four.

RAPA NUI ist ein subtiles und originell verzahntes Südsee-Osterinsel-Kartenauslegespiel mit zwei Kartenarten. Neben vier Sorten Opferkarten aus Papiermaulbeere, Süßkartoffel, Hering und Schilfbündel, deren Sorte, die am Schluss am meisten geopfert wurde, auch die meisten Punkte bringt, spielt man das Hauptspiel mit „Rapa-Nui-Karten“, von denen jeder drei auf der Hand hat. Wer dran ist, legt eine Karte vor sich aus, zieht eine Karte nach und löst dadurch eine Wertung aus, durch die man u.a. auch Opferkarten oder Siegpunkte bekommt. RAPA NUI hat in seinem sanften Flow eine charmante Klemmigkeit, die einen in seinen Spielbedürfnissen ständig schwanken lässt und aus einem scheinbar unscheinbaren Spiel im kleinen Karton ein besonderes macht.

I love this game. I'm partial to the theme, and mechanics-wise I often like stock speculation games and groupthink. The end game of this one has the latter, with scoring that is reminiscent of Big Points or Paris Connection or Quandary/Loco/Flinke Pinke/Botswana/Thor (by which I mean that which stock is best is determined entirely by the players through the course of the game) but with some partially hidden info (players who build moais have more info than those who don't). Plus there's other interesting stuff going on along the way, notably the card display, whereby when you take one card it "activates" the one below it, which will benefit one or more players -- I don't think I've seen that in other games. Lots of tough decisions given the fairly low rules overhead. The cards definitely add some luck, but the variable setup also allows the potential for the game to play out in really different ways. Scales great 2-4 (and playing well with 2 is unusual for stock games -- it's the partially hidden info that makes it work).

Very fun.  Secret element of sacrifice cards reminds me of Biblios.  Balancing how many cards you sacrifice to determine how many points the cards are worth versus how many cards you keep to score points reminds me of a stock purchase, hand management type of game.  And there is resource management too.  Great 2-player game.  Reminds me of a Kosmos game experience.  This game would be my pick over Jaipur, Jambo, or Lost Cities.
Would like to see how it plays with 3 or 4.

I really liked this game.  This is definitely a stock market game disguised by the theme as you gather sacrifice cards (stock types) and then sacrifice one whenever a moai card is built (most of type sacrificed gains three points per type you have at end of game, then 2, then 1, and fourth place resource gets nothing).  However, some of the cards sacrificed to drive up share price are kept secret so there remains some mystery where each resource/stock is in relationship to each other.  Different types of character cards are also played in your display allowing for collection of sacrifice cards, collection of wood for building moai or buying stock, or collection of glory points.

A strange but dry hybrid of stock-game mixed with card management.  All in all it's quite clever and impressive in how quick it plays.

The boring details: Your collected cards provide you and everybody else with the resources they depict whenever that resource is uncovered.  So imagine stacks of cards where you can see what the cards are in the stacks.  On your turn you play 1-3 cards of the same resources into your play area, then you refill your hand.  The last card you draft will uncover the card that determines what resource is triggered for scoring.  

Points are gained by sacrificed cards (among other things like points when Priest cards are triggered).  If you play an Moai card (which costs wood to build) then a sacrifice round is triggered.  Everybody sacrifices a resource card from their hand and you get to add another face-down resource card from the available resources.  At the end of the game the resources with the most sacrifices score the most points and are a multiplier to the resources in your hand.  The trick being that resources you sacrifice deplete your hand of potential points.

Card game di strategia dalle regole immediate. Il gioco è un azionario con ambientazione (decisamente appiccicata) originale, ci troviamo infatti catapultati in un antivo villaggio tribale. Le meccaniche sono fluide e il gioco risulta veloce e avvincente. La componente fortuna è presente ma meno incidente rispetto a tanti altri giochi di carte. Un paio di regolette mi lasciano un po' perplesso (la distribuzione dei punti in caso di risorse offerte agli Dei in caso di pareggi) ma il gioco risulta comunque godibile e adatto per tutta la famiglia. LA cover della scatola è abbastanza imbaazzante.

A deliciously quirky blend of goods-engine, selective activation, and speculation mechanics with unique, slightly unnerving art. With three almost completely disparate types of resource, It doesn't feel like the game could possibly be balanced, but miraculously it seems to be so. A triumph for either mathematics or blind luck and a genuine oddball.

[i]- Excellent family game
- Plays in under an hour, even with four
- Extremely innovative blend of mechanics...

[i]Resource collection[/i]

- you are trying to manage which out of the 4 resources will be worth the most points by not only collecting them but also sacrificing them [i](discarding them from your hand)[/i] to the gods [i](the card most sacrificed is worth 3, the one sacrificed least is worth 0)[/i]. 

[i]Activating workers[/i]

- First you place a card from your hand into your tableau of workers, then you draw a card from one of 4 rows [i](each column in a row has 4 cards to start)[/i] and you activate the card underneath the card you took. This really creates some interesting decisions, because you may really want a card, but activating the next one helps your opponents more than you.

[i]Building Moai[/i]
Lets you sacrifice a card from the draw piles and then secretly sacrifice another card [i](giving everyone else less info on how many of each type are in the sacrifice pile)[/i].

[i]I haven't played anything like this before, it is an excellent, quick game that I can't wait to play again. Unfortunately it was never released in the States and Kosmos has no plans to reprint it in German.[/i][/i]

A card drafting game with a smattering of majorities and stocks/collusion that turned out to at least have the virtue of feeling different. Thinking about the game afterwards, I realised it reminded me of Traders of Carthage, which added to my impression that it would probably be better with fewer than 4p. Both are card-drafting games with a look-ahead of a few turns in what players might be able to do, so they benefit from the greater control over timing and reduced chaos that fewer players offer.

--Oct2012-- Pleasant set collection game - with just enough right-left binding to demand players are roughly at the same experience level.  The duality between activating a card and revealing a copy for the next player is cool.  I'd be happy to play again (but probably won't buy a copy.)

We played it wrong for the first 5 games; when hunters and gatherers are scored, you should only get 1 card (plus 1 bonus), not 1 card for each hunter and gatherer! (adi)

Rapa Nui --

First Play:  I really enjoyed the interplay of control and uncertainty.  Rich stomped us, but it was fun the whole way through, and I found myself looking forward to trying different strategies in future plays.  Good sign.

Second Play:  I want this game! It's got more depth than initially apparent. Fun.

RATING: 7
An underrated title from the designer of [thing=822][/thing], which features a combination of shareholding and tableau-building. Much like in [thing=75358][/thing], there is the dilemma of having to junk shares in order to increase their values. There's also the angst of making the mandatory contribution to the pool whenever a moai is constructed.

The other neat aspect is the way drawing cards works, because players have to weigh getting the cards they want against activating the workers they need. The game rounds off with some contention for set majorities and a few different scoring routes.

Several people I played with didn't take to Rapa Nui, citing issues with its stiff artwork and the pseudo-memory element in the stock system. Make no mistake, this is very much a mechanisms-first design with a paper-thin theme. Still, it may not be amazing, but it captures many layered decisions in a compact package.

1 play FTF, 4er; the rest on Yucata, 2er.

Quick little game, with way too much chaos in the 4er version! Much better with 2, although not convinced that I need to own it quite yet. But it seems as if it could be a nice, quick filler for 2.

--- Summary ---
Players start with 1 woodcutter in play, a fixed hand of 3 hunters/gatherers (4 types in game), wood (more for players later in turn order), and 1 sacrifice card of each type (matching the hunters/gatherers). Shuffle the deck (woodcutters, harvesters, moai, and priests) and create 4 columns of 4 overlapping cards each.

On your turn, you _may_ take a sacrifice card: pay 5 wood, less 1 wood per hunters/gatherer of that type.

Then, play either:
- 1-3 hunters/gatherers of one type (1st is free, then pay 1 wood per extra card) into your personal display
- ONE woodcutter
- ONE priest
- ONE moai: pay 7 wood, and Sacrifice Round -- starting with player to left, place a sacrifice card on Stone; you play yours last, and place it face down. Also, place another sacrifice card (face up) taken from bank.

Finally, replenish your hand to 3 by taking cards from the display. If you take the last of a column, place 4 new cards from the deck in that space. If the draw deck runs out, the game ends IMMEDIATELY. Otherwise, the last card REVEALED is scored:
- hunter/gatherer: players get _1_ sacrifice card of that resource if they have that type of harvester; also, the player with the most (at least 2, and no ties) gets +1
- woodcutter: players earn 1 wood _per woodcutter_ they have; player with most (at least 2, and no ties) gets +1
- priest: players earn 1VP _per priest_ they have; player with most (at least 2, and no ties) gets +1VP
- moai: players get either 1VP or 1 wood per moai they have; player with most (at least 2, and no ties) gets +1 VP/wood

End of Game
- VP / sacrifice card in hand. Count all sacrifice cards on Stone and rank by type: sacrifice cards in players hands will be worth 3/2/1/0 for 1st/2nd/3rd/4th most cards (friendly ties).
- 4VP / moai
- 1VP / 5 wood
- VP earned during game from priests/moai
- Tie breaker = built moai, then remaining wood

Cool mechanics, this card game has some unique stuff going on. Sadly, it doesn't fully pull me in but I will give it more chances to grow on me. Somehow it should be more fun to play with the different score possibilities Rapa Nui has. I think I personally prefer to play with two players. Very interesting nevertheless, those who want something "new" should give it try.

Unusual is my first reaction, in a good way was my second, and not for four players is my third. A fourth would be to Make the sacrifices on the stone open apart from the face down placed cards- I.e. Remove the memory element. 

Hmm, 2nd play this was not great. Decisions, appeared automatic - score my advantages, only unpredictable bit the memory element. Shame as the mechanics are unusual and I really want to like this.

THis was a really cool and quite difficult card game.  Very simple rules, but a lot of choices to make.  The way scoring happens is brilliant.  It says it's for 2-4, but 2 was awesome and 3 seems to be the limit due to chaos.

I'd really like to get my hands on this one.

Felt pretty good, with a couple of different ways to score points.  Game choices felt constrained a lot of the time, with not a lot of ways to break out of obvious choices at the beginning of the game.  In my first play (2-player), the card flop was advantageous to my opponent that let them get far ahead of me on wood production.  By game end, the points had balanced out.  Would be interested in playing with more players.

This game blends several card-game mechanics I like while still feeling fresh. I like the set-collection aspect, the drafting aspect, and the way drafting triggers the events. I also like the way scoring is handled. Smart players should be able to contend even when dealt poor hands.

[thing=103132][/thing] is a neat game that, while still keeping itself light on rules, offers a good amount of indirect interaction and a fine set of decisions made throughout the play.

The basic of it is play cards in order to get resources - wood, fishes, turnips, etc - or to score points (with the Moai and the priests). The trick is: when something activates, everyone that has a type of that card will get resources, but the person that has the most, will gain one extra. This may seem like little, but it isn't. When a Moai is played, it has a cost of 7 wood, and when built, it will earn the player 4 points at the end of the game, and will trigger a offering round: players will choose a good from their hand in order to sacrifice, face up - the player that built the Moai can play one card face down. At the end of the game, the types of resources that have the most cards in the sacrifice pile will give players points for the one of the same type they have in hand, which is smart, as players want to make the resource they have or can get the most of score, but at the expense of losing cards of the very type they want to score. Once a card (or more than one, if playing) is played, the player draws from one of the piles, and the card opened bellow will trigger what resource players will receive. Plays goes like this until there isn't more cards in the deck.

[thing=103132][/thing] surprised me with the quality of the gameplay and how quickly its pacing is - the play went by in a breeze. Learning it was easy and even in my first play I was already competitive, meaning the learning curve isn't steep. [thing=103132][/thing] is indeed a good option for those looking for a 30-40 minutes game, with light rules, some depth, no direct attacks (but with interaction in the fight for resources and in building the sacrifice pile) and that plays fast. It works well with 4, still its pacing is better with 2 or 3. I recommend it.

RATING: 7.5
Stocklike with tension in that you increase value by sacrificing shares. Also, interesting effect bundling where in drawing new cards you also determine what will score points on your turn.

...Bought it, and like it! It's a commodity speculation game, but the randomized bundling of what you take into your hand (to potentially build later) to what will be produced this turn (including a majority game where you get a bit more if you produce the most) constrains the options so that it's not too open-ended.

In a nutshell, at game end you score points for each of four food types, equal to how many of that type you have times the bonus for how many of that type were "sacrificed" compared to the other types over the course of the game. Building hunter/gatherers for a given type makes it easier (in a couple of ways) to get more of that resource. Building Moai statues is inherently worth points, but also provokes a round of sacrifices, in which the builder gets to make an additional sacrifice paid by the bank. Lumberjacks produce wood, the money of the game, quite important. And priests just produce points. Moais produce points or wood, your choice.

You have to refill your hand (of three cards) from the bottom of four columns of four cards, and whatever you last take, the next lowest card of that column determines what will produce. So in the short term, when deciding what to build and how to refill your hand afterwards, there's a quite short list of what you could reasonably do.

The main downside of the game is actually the first thing I mentioned, that you have to sacrifice cards on-hand in order to increase their value. The rules call for a small amount of hidden information (in that the player building a Moai doesn't show the other players the card he sacrifices from his own possession) to keep this from becoming an annoying math problem, where you would have to determine whether it's actually worth giving up a card to increase the value of that type. Late in the game you'd also have to consider the likely effects on the other players' scores. I'm not a fan of either this type of arithmetic, or the hidden info.

I think this could probably be fixed (for my taste): Instead of sacrificing cards, just tally votes for the resources (with the Moai builder casting two). (But you'd probably want to recalibrate how resources score relative to everything else, since players would be able to retain a lot more resources than under the standard rules.)

Lovely streamlined resource and stocks game about sweet potatoes, moais and vegetable sacrifice on Easter Island - like a less mathy Splendor with better theme, much more interesting decisions and a stock market.

Admittedly at four this feels a little chaotic - and I imagine it would be better with fewer players. But the ruleset is so neat - especially the conflict between "selling" shares and their subsequent increase in value. This is a real winner.

One of the best stock holdings I've ever played with just two. Haven't played with more so can't comment about that - but I suspect 3 would be good/great whereas 4 would be just too chaotic. Biggest complaint is the theme. Just doesn't click with me.  Prefer stock holding games to feel economic. The concept of sacrifice just feels pasted on. Still, a great little game.

Hunting and gathering set collection game with very clever interaction with the other players.

Didn't blow me away, but it also didn't give me a reason to shy away in the future.

The "last card revealed gets activated" mechanic is unusual.  Player-driven stock value isn't necessarily new, but the variant implemented here isn't bad.

Played well with three, and the length was reasonable with that number.  Could be worse with four, both in terms of chaos and time added.

1 play. You collect and play cards which allow you to score points at the end or collect other cards which score at the end. That is not a good explanation but the game works well. Different than most games. Worth checking out.

Has very little to do with the original Settlers of Catan except for the resource production system.

The game itself is a pure race game with a some blocking moves and a little negotiation.

100% average game. I'll never pick it up myself and most likely suggest something else. However, Struggle for Rome is playable. If not pure joy but some challenge at least.

Based on the game "Settlers of Catan", but an entirely independent game. This game has great new twists and rules that make it a very different game experience. 
A good strategy helps winning the game, but there is enough luck involved to make this more than a one-sided game.

I was pleasantly surprised by this one. There have been a number of Catan variants and expansions which have had some mixed results. Luckily this is not the case with "Catan Histories: Struggle for Rome" which keeps the bare bones of Catan but adds a whole new level of strategy to the game and removes a lot of the luck problems that many people had with the original. 

If I didn't already own regular Catan I would have bought this one instead.

Good but too long and too tight on the resources. It also felt like there was a lot of luck involved and it lacked the trading element of Settlers. Trading is allowed exactly like in Settlers but there are few resources, less of them, and no one is willing to trade much. I also despised the pastures cards. I take my three gold to market and ask for a four legged animal with hooves? No, I ask for a _horse_ specifically. I need to check the rules as we all thought that was odd and frustrating.

RATING: 5
After the excellent Elasund, perhaps my favorite game by the esteemed designer of Settlers of Catan, I looked forward to the next Catan game.  To my chagrin, Struggle for Rome treads much closer to classic Catan than Elasund and runs into the same problems that have plagued the series.

It boggles my mind that 10 years after Settlers of Catan was released Teuber still makes the same critical mistakes.  Yet again, a Catan game comes out in which the resources of the game are a far cry from balanced.  In the beginning, every player needs horses and ore and to further exacerbate the problem, you draw livestock randomly from a deck containing horses and cows.  So even if you draw livestock you can end up with a hand of cattle.  Now cattle have a place as a resource needed to buy a development card, but much like in classic Settlers, development card rarely pay back what they cost and they are much cheaper here than in that game.

Now Teuber provides ample ways to overcome this problem, from the novel resource rolling scheme to paying for resources to receiving gold or resources for idle tribes, but everyone can benefit from these things.  I think the better way would be to have more options for you resources because as it stands the beginning of the game you only buy more units and development cards if you have nothing better to do.  Caravans are never purchased until people start settling cities and at the point the game is almost over.

Speaking of the two distinct phases of conquering and then settling, while nominally a cool idea, the execution seems off because once people begin to settle the game runs to a very quick conclusion.  So you spend the bulk of this nearly 2 hour game as a wandering barbarian.  I would like if the game were much shorter and that the length of the two phases were more equivalent.

Yet, when all is said and done, this remains Catan and therefore pretty fun.

This game has the simpleness of Catan games but with a little more meat. The game starts very slow and methodically and you can easily find yourself left behind if you don't join that initial jump into the thick of the board. You have to be very careful when to switch strategies and go for the end game. When the end game does come it all happens very quickly. Beautiful board and components. Easy game to learn and teach but perhaps a bit long for its on good.

Congratulations for sucking every last bit of enjoyment from the original game of Settlers: short play time, heavy interaction, road and city building,   working toward the last great spots, combining killer production/port combos... The only thing they left in was randomness, and this game is too long and painful for it.

RATING: 7
2/28/07 - resources: stone, wheat, cattle and horses (cards) are obtained through dice rolls. You need to ensure to have the numbers covered but can only do this once you have begun to conquer cities. Until you have plundered at least three cities in different regions you cannot attempt to conquer any cities. So until you get those first three with both your horsemen and warriors it can be a bit frustrating if you are not getting the dice rolls. The development cards offer some incentive but you never know what you're going to get (they are drawn blind) and they are somewhat costly - need a cattle card. Cattle is also used in building more supply wagons.

Reminds me of Starfarers the way you start at one end of the map and race towards the goodies, but Starfarers is just more fun and probably a lot more replayable.

Not a bad game, but not nearly as good as Settlers of the Stoneage.  I've only played it once and it was definitely a learning game.  I suspect my rating will rise with more plays as I already saw some things I would do differently (and I won in spite of that!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tentative rating after one play.  Much more to think about here than a standard Catan game.  Much greater need to plan ahead and out maneuver your opponents to get to the needed cities first.  So far, I like it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I think the thing that can make this game take maybe a little longer than it feels like it should is that the connectivity is a little hard to visualize. The layout of the map and the movement costs are actually very clever, and nicely allow you to move in interesting ways at low cost and without rules complexity, but it can also lead to some AP if people have a hard time seeing their options. So YMMV. I like this one quite a bit but if it takes 2.5hr because it takes people a while to figure out their moves, it's going to feel too slow. Also, trading is a little thin for a settlers game. I enjoy the more open trading of Settlers and Starfarers, but others prefer the games with less.
---
UPDATE: I've played this a number of times now and the rating is holding steady. It's not a top-shelf Catan game, but it is quite good, and I always like two-phase games where the two different parts of the game are quite different. As always, Catan games want to be short-ish, and Struggle for Rome isn't quite there on that count, but the subtle massaging that has been done to the system helps ameliorate the length significantly. Probably the biggest complaint is just that it lacks the tremendous variety of classic Settlers - the board is the same each time. So, not one that's going to be a regular, but still a very fun and interesting game which is another successful port of the Settlers engine, one which is different enough to be worthwhile, and still successful in its own right.
---
First play of this was really promising. I like the fact that it's a little more tactical than traditional Settlers, with lots of trade-offs around moving your tribes on the board (do you go for plunder, or good locations? When do you settle down and form a kingdom?). Trade has been somewhat de-emphasized, moreso than in any other Settlers game I think, but there is just enough to keep things going.

The historical theme is very well-done and far and away the best of any of the Settlers products. It would great if the Romans were more than just a version of the Robber, but even so, it's still very nice.

In Chris' hierarchy of the multi-player Settlers products, I'd judge that it's not quite as strong as any of the mainline games (Settlers, Seafarers, Cities & Knights, Starfarers, Elasund, or Candamir - hey, I like Candamir), but it is comfortably the best of the "historical" and variant games (Cheops, Alexander, Great Wall, Trojan War, Nurnburg, Stone Age).

It's an nice game using the settler's production mechanic with an interesting twist of resources can change through the game and will have to but there are four chances of hitting a number instead of just the one per player turn. 3 Plays.

A refreshing take on Settlers mechanics.  I enjoy how you actually get to move your cities (here armies) around the map.  I enjoy the building up of the armies which creates two distinct phases to the game with different feels.  Trading is not as important but the added element of money can swing the deal in a trade for resources.  All in all, I enjoy this one slightly more than stone age.

RATING: 5
A Settlers of Catan variant, where players represent Germanic hordes invading the Roman Empire.  Players beetle across a map of Europe with a warband (mounted) and a settlers band (on foot).  Along the way there are cities to conquer which provide short term rewards, and help towards the cost of long term settlement.  Players later in the game can decide to settle down, form a city from their nomads, and begin playing "real Settlers".  From this point, the game feels more normal, but tends to end very quickly.  So so variant, feels rather stiff and scripted - not sure how many times I'd like to play this over the base game.  Long, repetitive, and a bit dull.  

Played again in 2012, and can't disagree with anything I said above in 2008 ... also, trading was almost non-existent - we traded perhaps 5 times total in the entire game.

RATING: 6
An interesting variaton on the settlers games. For me the beauty of Settlers games has always been the trading dynamics, but we didn't see a lot of trading happening here. But that was only in a first test-spin of half of a game, so it is too early to tell. Game goes a great job in having multiple paths to victory, being a non-confrontational game, and having lots of little puzzles to figure out. Looking forward to trying it out again.

A settlers varient with more meat. I enjoy the theme of this varient.

The dice rolls is a nice touch and different. A little longer than I would like, but so much fun I don't mind that much. A little less trading than normal. Not for non-gamers. Mechanics are very interesting and different.

The game I played, on the same turn all 3 players finished with 10 points. I won with the most money.

Talk about a close finish.

Looking forward to play this game again very soon.

Well, this went over better than Settlers with my younger son. Very streamlined and strategies are quick to be seen. Feels like it plays quicker than Antike, which is his most requested game, and doesn't seem as scripted as Antike's end game has become. Like Antike, games are very tight, though. Looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 7
One of the better Settler variants, this time with some edge, as player competition and the impact of the "legionnaire" is more felt than in any other variant, especially because there are basically only three things you can build, and it's easy to miss or lose that decisive card. Trading on the other hand will happen rarely, making for a more area control dominated game. Game material is of usual high Kosmos standard, and one can tell that there is still some thought going into this retreaded theme.

Four games now.  Some concern that this may be a bit long for what it delivers ? Still keen to play more - with the right people.  Scope for analysis paralysis in this one.

We played to learn the rules and stopped before we got to conquering cities. Your first game might be a little long, but in truth the game is fairly simple. I have a couple of rule questions, but it's all pretty easy and nicely progressive. I suspect being able to read the map well and make good decisions of where to stand will make a long term difference. I certainly want to play it through. (note, our copy was short on player pieces).

Struggle for Rome is another game from the Catan universe where you roll for resources in Catan fashion, but this rest of it is markedly different. There is two clear phases of this game: plunder the Roman cities for the first half and then choose the optimal time to establish your own kingdoms in the second half. It is an interesting game of timing, though clearly optimal moves exist and it all comes down to luck of the dice and development cards. That being said, it's still an interesting game and a fun time and has enough differences to base Catan to titillate a Catan fan (though people who hate Catan might still dislike this one). I've always considered Settlers a '7' game, made 8 by its historical significance and personal gratitude. Some Catan products get an 8 out from merit alone. Struggle for Rome gets a '7' based purely on the game play. Interesting stuff and I enjoy playing, but the game has a slightly scripted feel, and the diminished chances for blocking and trading make it feel a little more like MPS than the other Catan games. Still, good stuff and enjoyable and a theme I get.

I wanted to love this game so badly.  It's Catan, and it's Roman-themed!  That must be a winning combination, right?  Sadly, the game mechanics seem to take a back seat in this one.  The two main phases of the game are rather disconnected, and the player interaction is next to null.  I'm only keeping and playing this game for the player vs. player combat variant.  Really nice playing pieces and map, and  I often rob the gold for use in other games.

This is in my opinion the weakest Catan game I've played.  The game takes too long to develop as the tribes wander, raid, and pillage.  Once the tribes settle down, the game hastens to a conclusion, but it's too little too late in my estimation.  Where has the trading gone?  Has Settlers finally jumped the shark?

Reminds me of Anno 1503 by the same designer - the basic concept is the same as in Settlers but the execution makes perfectly clear that these are the details that make the game.

Finally got a chance to play this at a local late night gaming event.  Have to admit I wasn't very impressed.  I couldn't tell you exactly what I didn't like; I just didn't like the feel of the game.  It just felt odd.  Especially the transition from the exploration of the early game to the rapid exansionism of the endgame.  I think I prefer other iterations of the Catan Engine better.

This is an often overlooked, but pleasant Settlers variant. It also feels more balanced in the case that you have a pretty even start for all the players. I like the change of pace when you go from raiding to settling. The game seems to be less confrontal than the main game. One minor complaint is that the game is a little long.

While some mechanics are similar to Catan, it doesn't feel like Catan when I'm playing.  Familiarity with Catan will make the learning curve a little easier on this fun game.  While theme is pillaging and conquering, it is really an exploration and race game.  Players are in more of a race to pillage cities and ultimately build their own settlements to win before the other players.

Though it still uses some Basic "Settlers of Catan"-mechanics, it is a completely different game. It takes longer than settlers, but since it has less luck, more strategic choices and a better theme, I am fine with that.

This is a good game using some concepts from the original Catan and adding entirely new stuff. It is a little more involved than the original, making it less appropriate as a gateway game, but I like the theme very much and how the game system serves it; it is not a simulation, but the streamlined ruleset does an excellent job.
The bits and the board are nice.
Bravo Mr Teuber, you have a knack for self plagiarism: Struggle for Rome is like those rare kitchen recipes that turn yesterday's leftovers into a feast.
This of course does not replace the original Catan but offers a very  nice variation, a very sound alternative if you want a catan-ish experience but have a little more time.

This game expands on the Settlers of Catan theme, and uses a few of the Catan mechanisms.  However, I find the ability to use cards differently reduces the amount of trading and interractions between players.  There also is an end-game effect much like Chicken, where the first to settle on a city has the advantage.  

All-in all, it is a pretty and fairly easy game to play.  I prefer the original Catan or variants to this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very long for what it is. A luckfest in the early game, where trading tends to make little sense. Pillaging is not all that attractive, since many times you'll end up behind resources wise

Has some interesting new wrinkles (e.g., plundering of unconquered cities, money) built on the chassis of the Settlers of Catan game system.  Glad I had a chance to play, but the game (at its core) still boils down to the Settlers of Catan fundamentals.  Definitely longer than Settlers.  

Note: trading seems to be less prevalent in this game than in Settlers of Catan.

Nice variation of the evergreen. I'm happy to have it in my collection to satisfy players that prefer playing Catan over any other game. 
Moving your tribes over the board is a good "novelty" for the Catan series, it makes you less vulnerable for the robber, so less possibilities that people will "complain" about bad luck with dice rolls. The "racing" aspect is appealing. 
Other than this no real differences from the standard Catan series. It's a good game.

I'd rate it higher, except the BGG guildlines say you'd usually be willing to play for a 7... and I'm not sure about the replayability.

After two plays, I am really impressed by this game, which I find a little surprising because I usually don't like games of this length to play, but I find myself kind of intrigued and wanting to play it more and more.  I find it a very interesting timing question as to when you decide to "flip the switch" and go to conquering mode from plundering.  I have seen different strategies win.  I like the game quite a bit, but I seem to be in a minority with the group I game with on this one.

Ok idea but just a bit dull in execution and vanilla Settlers is still a whole lot better.  The static board removes one of the major features of the base game, and SFR is more tactical rather than strategic, which is another downside for me.

A nice variation on the basic Settlers idea.  Initially the game is hard to digest, and for some reason it is still quite difficult to quickly survey the board and figure out what numbers you have.  Also, initial play time is quite long, which would hopefully be cut down with further play.  If it was always going to take over 2 hours I don't think I'd want to play.  Also, the fixed board makes me think that replayability may be an issue.  There doesn't seem to be too much interaction aside from racing to plunder/conquer the best spots.  Trading didn't seem too popular/necessary, but maybe that will change in time.  However, the game is fun and a nice change of pace from regular Settlers.

Traded away.

My son likes this game. Strategy in it is hit and miss. You can easily get blocked in a 4 player game once you have conquered a city because the rules don't allow you to conquer anything other than adjacent cities. All the strategy in the world might not prevent it from happening to you. It is fun though and the rule set is fairly simple (like most Catan games).

I've only played once, and my impression is generally positive.  My overall thoughts are that this is a simplified Settlers game preceeded by a phase of exploration and raiding.

Another sibling in the Catan family. It is quite surprising that this new variant still adds something refreshing. Yes, the resources are gained in the same way as the basic SoC, but the game play is very dynamic. The "houses" move over the board and hence are called tribes. Minor point: the diplomat cards seem a bit too strong. Also the strategy looks straightforward: first plunder until you have four or five different tokens and then settle on the most convenient cities. How to do this depends on the luck of the cards (cow or horse) and the dice. Although it is possible to trade, there is not that much desire or incentive. Fun to play once, but no urge to have this game on the table often.

It has a similar feel to Settlers of the Stone Age but I think this one is a bit better.  There might possibly be an optimal strategy towards the second half of the game when players begin Conquering cities (certain cities/areas are more ideal for their resources).  The 2 VPs card for both your armies conquering four cities is a bit too powerful.  I think it should be something like 1 VP for three cities each or 2 VPs for five cities each.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Trading becomes minimal in this game and early mistakes will potentially cost you severely in this game.  I'm not certain its wise to start building cities too early in this game unless you are ready to go on a city building spree.  Different enough from other Catan games to stand alone, it does tend to take over 2 hours which for me means it starts to overstay its welcome (only one play in thus far, would be willing to give it another go around).

Seemed more strategic than other versions of Catan, definite beginning, middle, and end game.  Played once with 3 players and once with 4, and the games were very different, though it seemed the 4 players was preferable.  It was harder to predict part way through who was going to win, which isn't all that hard to do with regular Catan.  And even though the winner wasn't me, it was still enjoyable and will play again soon.

Definately a different direction for the Catan franchise. The game does have limited trading, and the first play through is on the long side (though it doesn't feel that way). I know with experience that this game can be played in much less than the 90 minutes it's rated for.

It's a good game; but not great; but definitely worth playing many times to come.

Update:

As our gaming experience has grown so too has that allowed us to see more bad than good here. It lasted less than 10 plays before the trade.

My second favorite Catan game.  It is right above the Card Game for me, and right below using Cities & Knights with The Fishermen and a dice deck.

No need for a dice deck in Struggle for Rome, as the "already rolled that" mechanic using for production rolls takes a lot of the lumps out of the bell curve.

So many choices to make each turn, and lot's of room to adjust for errors.  Nice distinct feeling of two separate ages, making the first and second halves of the game feel like completely different games, yet the transition between the two is smooth.

Pretty game, too.

The theme of this game may be off-putting to folks who don't like direct conflict or war games.  That's too bad, because there's no real combat, and no direct conflict.

On paper, this is a nifty game.  It's Settlers, but with plunder, sieges, exploration, tribes and empires.  But I don't think it fits together all that well, and for the time invested I'd rather play Settlers or another Euro.  I hate game designs with optimal first turn strategies, and this has one; if you don't buy men the first turn, you can't siege anything while the other players go to town (as it were).  It's also too luck-driven, even for Settlers, and too long; after an hour or so, once you finally start carving out an empire, then a game of Settlers behins.  Also, and more damning, there is hardly any trading to speak of in the game, and thus no player interaction.  I'll stick with vanilla, thank you very much.

Here, the Catan world has been rethemed for Rome. Players control two Germanic trines (horseman and warrior tribes). Either unit may move to plunder lands, but once they settle a land, they may never plunder again. The terrain consists of ore, wheat fields, and plains. The twist is that the plains will give you bulls or horses as a resource, but that is determined randomly. There is also gold in the game. A bull and a gold give you a discovery card, a horse and an ore give you a horesman and army, while a horse, bull and wheat give you a wagon (Wagons are required for settlements). You earn 1 VP per settlement, 2 VPs, if either of your units conquer 5 different types of land, 2 VPs if both your units settle 4 lands, etc. It's a neat twist on the origial Settlers and fun to play. It's not quite as clean as the original Settlers since you have to calculate where you want your units to move and pay a cost. The tension in this game is deciding to leave Germania and leave yourself exposed to the Legionnaire (the robber) and start plundering Roman cities. Tough decisions also on whether to continue plundering or to settle.  It's a decent game and clocks in at about 2 hours.

One of the most uninteresting Settlers variants I've ever played. With so few things to build, and the choice to build largely obvious through most of the game, there was little tension or tradeoff. Getting somewhere good was largely determined by turn order, and so there was little feeling of race tension either - it was either there by the time it was your turn, or not. No need to try this one again.

The first part of the game is really good, another interesting twist on the settler-system (and I usually dont play Settler-Spinoffs). But the second part. UGH! Seems to be totally pointless.

If you are a fan of Settlers or in fact even if you are not, this is a game worth trying out. Settlers has a way of making a game not only interesting, but fun to play and not a brain drain. This is definitely a keeper for me and would recommend it to pretty much anyone. Simple enough to learn, with enough differences to make it a great stand alone and not seem repetitive to the other games in the Settlers family.

Once you settled and started expanding cities you found there weren't enough types of resources nor options in how to use them to make trading worthwhile. Imagine Settlers without trading and you have a very boring second half of the game. Glad we only needed 10 victory points to end it. Not broken, but only half fun.

I really like Settlers of Catan. I really like historical board games. So when I first heard about this game, I got really excited and bought it.

Naturally, I was sorely disappointed.

Oh, it's not a bad game. I would even call it a good game. It has the basic SoC mechanics I love, and yet it is different enough that I didn't feel I had bought a game I already owned with a few cosmetic adjustments. (Bevery Hillbillies Monopoly 1968 anyone?)

But had dreamed of a game that would trace the decline and fall of the Roman empire from maybe the death of Julius Caesar to (one of) the sacking of Rome by the Vandals/Huns/Vikings/Goths etc.

But no. The players are simply generic unnamed barbarians who attack areas around Italy and try to outdo other generic unnamed barbarians. There's nothing wrong with this, and indeed it I do admit it is a good game. I had just hoped for a DIFFERENT game.

Rating based on one play.  Different to Settlers, but using the same basic mechanics.  Play time was 2.5-3 hours, in part due to unfamiliarity with the new rules and also the German text on the cards.  I expect it to take 2 hours in future.  Good game, but not stellar, with some interesting decisions.

I rated it down after some time - the first period of travelling around is a little bit too long and the player who first settles down usually will win the game. Too much depends on whether you get the horses at the right time to strengthen your army.

One play. A decent Settler's variant. It tries to make the game more strategic by incorporating a few key choice points: go for 'scourge of rome' reward or settle early, build up wagons early to earn the 'inheritor of rome' or buy cards to be the diplomat. Those choices are all OK, but our game took a bit too long - I think the problem is that in normal Settlers, many turns are "roll the dice, do nothing" whereas here you usually roam about looking for plunder which makes each move take longer. The trading is infrequent as there are fewer goods types, the building is less interesting as there are fewer tradeoffs (can't use a cow to get people, nor a horse for a card), and the event cards lack the drama of "monopoly". This would all be OK for a 30-45 minute game, but drag down the game as it was for us (90 minutes)

Another settler variant which lacks good dramaturgy. In the first phase you move your 2 tribes across the board simply plundering. Not much tension during this, since no victory points are gathered.
(the 2 points for the big-plunderer are not worth the effort!) -- Resources are scarce at the beginning, not much trading therefore (which is one of the fun parts in settlers), instead, every turn the dice are rolled at least 4 times (if you roll a number for a second time you have to reroll). This means awful and stupid downtime...

Then, suddenly, the game enters the kingdom-founding-phase: Now, resources pop up and you are drowning in them! -- Here you gather the victory points and you gather them very fast.

All in all: no real strategy possible in how you can have influence on the other players. The board is wide, the dice are rolled too much .... Boring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although the mechanisme of obtaining resources is Catan-like, a big difference is that instead of static villages and cities, the players move with their 2 armies around the board. Later on the game surprisingly turns into a more static play when cities are build (in fact the cities have to be conquered instead of build). Good game.

I was disappointed by the last Catan histories I played (Trials to Rails), but this one came through.  I love that you have to phases and there are multiple choices for victory.  Even my mother enjoyed it and quickly picked it up.  The history behind is also decent, which is always a plus although it wouldn't necessarily teach much, it is a fun way to play with history. And you could easily add your own educational element to it if you chose to.(JW)

A great entry into the historical line of Settler games. I was not surprised to see the runaway leader problem persist into even this game. Other than that, it mixes in some novel mechanics previously unseen in the series to great effect. Options do seem somewhat restrictive as the game progresses, and there were extended times of resource shortage, but it didn't damper my overall enjoyment. I think Settlers of America is a slightly better game, but Struggle for Rome is certainly more welcome than a typical game of vanilla Settlers.

We demo'd this at Origins and thoroughly enjoyed this one.  It's a bit more satisfying to me than the Settlers of the Stone Age, and we all liked the shift from nomadic mechanic to the settling/conquest mechanic.  Also really liked the fluidity of the game turn, the amount of participation on other players' turns, and the multiple die-throws to generate resources.  Highly replayable.

I like the Settlers series. In this one, the map is fixed as in Stone Age. Also, the pieces roam about. What's different is that you plunder cities, at least at first, before finally settling down to build. There is a bit of a twist on how the resources work as well.

I had a really difficult time evaluating the rating for this game.  First off, I really like the core Settlers engine and enjoy trying games that take this in new directions.  Unfortunately, the Settlers engine really wants a game to be no longer than 45 - 60 minutes.  That is my first knock against this game.  It is just too long for what the system wants it to be.

I do like the exploration (and plundering) aspect of the game.  It is very interesting.  However, it is essentially a crapshoot.  This alone can make your life very difficult or easy as you play.  In particular, early in the game this seems to have a pronounced effect.

I like the use of two different tribes.  I like and dislike some things about the structured order of your movement/actions.  I really like the two different phases of the game.  Unfortunately, it seems that once someone begins the second phase, the game really begins to snowball.

The randomness of the resources can be a problem in all of the Settlers games.  However, in this game, if you get locked out of resources a couple of turns early, you get really far behind in a hurry.  It is absolutely necessary early on to be able to keep up.

Finally, I'm not convinced that the player order is not completely out of whack.  The first player seems to have a very distinct advantage, particularly in a four player game.

Overall, I enjoyed playing the game, am glad I played it, and would be willing to play again.  Unfortunately, after having played it, I don't have any real desire to seek it out again.  I would much rather play two (or even three) games of vanilla Settlers or one of Starfarers (which clocks in at about the same length). [11/26/2008]

RATING: 8.1
Struggle for Rome -- Played twice; four-player.  

A thoughtful and unexpected gift from Jon & Cindy!

I'm most struck by the many ways in which this game succeeds in its attempts to ensure balance:  The distribution of numbers and terrain types.  The requirement that the production rolls result in four different numbers.  The change in the usefulness and availability of gold as the player progresses from wandering to expanding.  In the end-game, you simply can't be sure of who will win until the moment it happens.

In the mid-game, it's likely that intersections which offer both convenient plunder and great numbers for production have been exhausted, so players will have to choose between plunder or production.  By this point in the game, players must plan at least one round ahead for their placements to pay off.  

During the "Roll for Resources" phase, the legionnaire can steal only one card, which helps keep the production phase hopeful, but there are plenty of Diplomat cards to create a frustrating level of jeopardy in the "Trading & Building" phase.  And while Culture cards only help at game end, the other Development cards are not only useful, but each card can be used in more than one way -- sometimes in unplanned ways.  If you're going to purchase a Development card, do so before any other purchases.  The card you draw may change your purchase plans.

While it's rare that having a tribe forego its actions is a good thing, even this can be ameliorated by keeping in mind the fixed order of tribal actions.  For example, if your tribes are both strong, but you have no gold or wheat to enable their movement to plunderable cities, remember that Horsemen act first.  Don't waste your Horsemens' action on a partial move.  Instead, have your Horsemen stay put and draw one grain or two gold.  You can then use the acquired resource to increase your Warriors' ability to move.  This is a specific example of a general principle:  The benefits from skipping a tribal action can be maximized by keeping an eye on the order of play.  If you anticipate that you may have to forego the action for one of your tribes, determine whether skipping your Horsemen action might help your Warriors, or whether skipping your Warrior action might benefit you in the following round.  If you will be next to roll for production, then you can afford to skip your Warrior action and use the rewards shortly thereafter during the Trading & Building phase.  This is because you will control the legionnaire (and will therefore be safe from it) and you will act before anyone can threaten your resources with Diplomat cards.  

Because plunder is both randomly distributed and hidden, two-tower cities have as much chance of good plunder as any other cities.  In the early game, this generally makes two-tower cities more desirable for plunder than more fortified cities.  No one wants to leave behind easily plundered cities for the ready benefit of their opponents.  However, I expect that most strategies will involve a plan of migration for the wandering tribes.  This sometimes means that it is best to take a stronger city while you can, so that if the plunder token requires the loss of tribe strength, you're still strong enough to plunder a weaker city on the following turn -- assuming no one else gets there first!

Even the "Terror of the Legions" expansion (freely downloadable from Herr Teuber's website) is designed to balance the desirability of conquering the more fortified four-tower cities with the generally more desirable two- or three-tower cites.

When you don't get what you want, you can still make use of what you do get.  This may dictate your strategy to some degree, but after playing only two games it became very apparent that victory is accessible by various paths.  The game has clearly been designed to reward adaptability -- there are no simple strategies with guaranteed victory.  Still, I think there are some safe bets.

Building up your wagon supply early is never a bad idea.  It will increase the gold you get from plunder, and since you keep your wagons until you conquer, the wagons you build up will be ready for use when you expand your empire.

When expanding your empire, you must find the balance between three concerns:  placement on good production locations, placement which prevents your own further expansion from being blocked by your opponents, and placement which prevents your opponents from reaching their expansion goals.  There's that word again...

Balance.

This is certainly a clever variation of the Settlers machine, but while it is cool to see it in action, it isn't overwhelmingly exciting.  You kind of do the same stuff over and over again racing across the map trying to pick the easy stuff before other players can get to it, while finishing your moves on some good numbers.  There is certainly a timing issue of when you want to settle, but the fact that you can only settle after getting three cities when getting five area gets you the two points, it seems like you should go for the points.  If you could settle without rampaging as much there may be more of a choice. Especially when you spend to build an army up you are also adding to the other.  It feels like there was a missed opportunity for decision making here.  It seems that you just need to evaluate whether it will be possible to color up with your second army, in which case the decision is whether you would want to settle with your weaker guy ASAP or to play the odds to get a better shot at the horde bonus.

It also seems that the horses are too important (especially in the beginning of the game).  I feel that everyone should just start with a horse as well as a wheat.  Some goods are clearly better than other goods and you never really get a glut of any goods so there isn't much incentive to trade in the first half of the game; this means that there is very little interaction.  

I really have a problem with the first turn of the game.  I'm sure that it all evens out as the game progresses, but the fact that the last player goes last twice means that there really isn't much for that player to do but to spend resources for a better position or to just get humped.  If the last player were to get a cow on top of this then they really would be behind the curve. Yes you can buy event cards and not move to get extra resources, but in the two games I've played it feels you really have to climb hard and get lucky to be competitive.

I feel that there would be more to the game if when you flip a tile and conquer it you have to flip two other tiles near it.  This way the exploration isn't quite a random. It seems like the best way to deal with the first player getting the leg up, and gives incentive to attacking something other than the weakest city.  Perhaps this would make the game less obvious.

All in all it is a placid game, but overstays its welcome. Most of the game comes down to lucky rolls, lucky exploration draws, getting the horses when you need them and getting to where you need to first.  It really is just too long for what it is.  On my first game we decided to quit the game after a couple hours.  The second game clocked in at a somewhat reasonable time, but we had a runaway leader that continued to get VERY lucky. Totally inoffensive, but not really all that exciting or fun.  I'd play it again if someone REALLY wanted to, but I will probably spend the whole time wishing the game were half as long.  The only reason why I give this a 4.5 is that it is cool to see what could be done with the Settlers system.

I liked this better than original-recipe Settlers. The first half of the game, which is the analogue for the initial settlement placement in Settlers, requires clever and careful movement on a board that can be a bit tricky to navigate. The second half is much more reminiscent of Settlers, but goes by pretty quickly.

The new Catan game. The map shows the Roman Empire, in 5 provinces, with cities scattered throughtout. There is also a small area (6 hexes?) outside the empire. at the start, place a hex face down in each city (color coded by province). Players each have 2 tokens, 1/army (horseman and footmen; functionally the same) that start outside the empire. On a turn, the active player rolls 2d6 until 4 different #s are rolled. Each unique # is resolved as it is rolled, similar to basic Settlers: resources (ore, grain, and 2 types of green - horse and cow, shuffled together face down) produce, and 7s --> robber ("Roman Legionnaire") robs (if no resources, he takes gold instead). Then the active player trades. Then, in turn order, ALL players build/buy stuff. Then ALL players move horseman army. Then ALL players move footman army. Movement is over arrows along hex sides or on sea routes: first arrow is free, then costs 1 grain or 3 gold per land arrow, 1 gold/sea arrow. If the army ends adjacent to a city, it may pillage it if army strength %u2265 city defense (2-5, shown on board). If so, take the token; the back shows casualties (0 or 1) and reward (gold, and possibly card). Each army may not pillage more than 2 cities from each province. After it has pillaged from 3 provinces, it may conquer instead of pillaging -- this is done in the same way, except the army no longer moves around the board. The new kingdom expands by attacking ROMAN (not other players') cities 1 arrow away. Players get VP several ways:
-1/city conquered
-2 for greatest army equivalent
-2/army that pillages from all 5 provinces
-2 if BOTH armies pillage 4 cities
-1/appropriate special card
The game ends when any player gets to 10VP - must announce this. Whoever has the most VP at the end of the round wins!

Played only a partial game with the rules wrong. Still, I think this may be one of the best variants yet. Of course, would be nice to actually play a game correctly!

I like most versions of Settlers and had high hopes, but it's too long without being overly compelling.  The design is actually quite interesting and creative.

My least favourite of all Catan-spin offs I've played. This just takes too darn long! Because resources are so scarce, trading happens only occasionally. The games thus loses much of the appeal of the Catan family, which was based mostly on the trading and the short playing time. For a longer Catan experience, I'd much rather play Starfarers or Cities and Knight combined with Seafarers)

This is a very worthy addition to a game shelf, in particular if your collection is already fairly large.  This is a fun, solid game, and pretty much stays within the same playtime and balanced-points curve of it progenitor.  The static set up will lower replay value, although the random effects of plundering a city mixes it up a little.  That is why it will work nicely on an already burgeoning game shelf.  If you'll only play it infrequently, it is a lot of fun, but don't expect this to be a game you'll want to explore for the next 10 game nights in a row.

There is a lot more tactical thinking in this compared to the original, and it is a fun cross between tactical and stategic--you can pla several turns away, but you'll need to keep those plans fluid to adjust for other player actions.  It feels like a cross between Albion and the original Catan--and where Albion felt static and within a couple plays had a 'solved' first half, Struggle for Rome was much more interestingly expansive from the start.

Single play. Interesting take on the Settlers idea. The basic roll 2d6 to decide which hexes produce goods is here, but it now underpins a game of dynamic movement. Each player has 2 tribes which race across the board plundering cities before settling to conquer those cities at which point the game mutates (tribe-by-tribe) into a game of blocking. All the while you need resources to rebuild your armies and wagons that have been lost through attrition.

Unlike most Setters-spawned titles, I enjoyed this because it was so fundamentally different from the basic game that it didn't feel like I was playing 'Settlers complexified'.  An interesting decision has to be made in midgame regarding when to abandon the earlygame and begin the endgame (forfeiting any further benefits of the early-game method of play).  It seemed holding cards was punished often enough that players usually exhausted cards as soon as possible and this led to virtually no trading.

Played 3 demos at Origins 2007.  Got to play 1st full game and one player got behind and was real upset he couldn't catch up.  Need to see if there's a runaway leader problem or just a problem of how we played.  The game is taking over 2 hours when you have to teach.  I might like this better once everyone knows the game and it plays faster.
Unfortunately, not getting to play this game is keeping the length to over 2 hours given the need to teach and players taking way too long to make decisions.
I really like the game, but can't get my group to play so trade offers will be considered.

I don't know how Klaus keeps doing it--using the same dice rolling, resource accumulating mechanic and designing really engaging games around it.  Over and over.  In my view, Struggle for Rome is the best non-expansion, standalone Settlers game there is.  It's not as simple and elegant as basic Settlers, but there is a lot more to chew on, actions have significance, and it's still not terribly complicated.  In fact, in some regards, this game is streamlined compared to regular Settlers.  I'll go so far as to say that this game feels like a great game, without feeling like a good derivation or reworking of the Settlers mechanic.  Enjoyable.

(After 1 4p game)  Settler's with a bit of a Tempus feel (build cities) to me.  First game took 2.5, a little long, but should come down if we play again soon.   
(After 2nd 4p game)  Game time shortened to just under 2 hours with 2 newbies.

A fairly interesting twist on the Catan series. I have only had the chance to play it as a two player where we both played two colors, which was a bit cumbersome.  But overall I see this as a fun game that I would be willing to put on the table frequently.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
1e essai  à 4 joueurs. Mise en contexte = suite à la demande d’un ami ayant acheté ce jeu comme alternative à Catane. Après seulement 2 rondes de jeu, les joueurs se sont mis d'accord pour arrêter la partie dû au peu de plaisir ressenti vs durée de jeu anticipée. De plus, 2 autres aspects du jeu m’ont déplu : 
1e) plateau statique qui me fait craindre une progression similaire d'une partie à l'autre (départs identiques, villes avec indices de conquête fixes);
2e) règles de migration et colonisation qui font que lorsqu'on colonise, la migration n'est plus possible.

Being an Italy afficionado, this one both appealed and plays well.  I like the expansion effect as the game progresses.

Resource management plus a bit of area control - I prefer this to the original Settlers - there seems to be more to think about and more options.  It looks good and the pieces are small and cute.

It's the most different of the settlers variants I've played, but it still gets knocked to 6.5 in my book for being "same same but different" as my Vietnamese tour guide kept saying on my trip to Northern Vietnam last year.  Pacing is relatively slow in the beginning and then roars across the endgame as cities start to be built, as more and more resources show up.

rating after 1 game.Another settler clone. 

Looked interesting. Needed 120 minutes instead of 60-90, although playing fast. 

Problem: One player was out of game early after 3 rounds without gaining ressources (although he had very good numbers). Catch-up seems to be *much* harder than in settlers. Well, thats another 90 minutes playing without a chance to leave the last place.

On the board you have a fixed map that represents southern Europe. The players represent Germanic tribes that are marching on Rome. Each player has two armies that start in the northeastern corner of the board. These armies will move across the board, pillaging cities for resources. 

Uses many concepts from Settlers of Catan, but plays very differently.

Better than Settlers I think

Good variant of catan - two phases make for completely different play at start vs finish, and with lots of opportunity for screwage, I think I prefer it to the original.

It's pretty interesting to have 'moving' settlements in the form of your barbarians. The game suffers from a lack of balance: the second part of the game goes really, really fast. In the beginning it's hard to get just 1 victory point, but after the entire board has been plundered, you get victory points very quickly and the game is over in a minute. It's... quite anti-climatic.

first play of the new edition, tells me that this is a very complicated game that you could delve into and get really good at, but that would be the only game you played.  there's a lot of depth, but it's like multi-player chess, if you could argue the other guy out of his move.  not really my type of game.  very good thematic content.  too many errors and typos in the new edition.

RATING: 7.5
a good Catan variant where you have to decide when to stop conquering and start settling

my kids and I like this one even more than Catan.

RATING: 6.5
First play, with just 3 players, was far too long, over two and a half hours. Despite that it is an interesting variation on the Catan concept. The actual mechanics are more streamlined, the luck of the die is minimized because there are four rolls every turn, and play is more dynamic because of the moving tribes. Trading seems less important, though, because all players can usually use every resource they have in some way or the other. I did feel that the splitting up of the pasture cards into horses and cows can add a nasty bit of luck of the game. I couldn't draw a horse in the beginning of the game, setting me back significantly, a nasty trait the game shares with the original Catan.

All in all, an interesting concept that needs more exploring. Most important will be whether we get the playing time down to 75 minutes or so, because it would fill that niche nicely. If it continues to be a 100 minute plus game then there are more interesting games to be played in that category.

nice variant on the Catan theme. A little less player interaction than I would like, i.e. there was very little incentive to trade in the one playing I had

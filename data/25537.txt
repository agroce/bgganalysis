Excellent but you need lots of extra blowers because they can't be sterilized and they tear easily.  Fortunately, any party supply store and even some dollar stores will have them in stock so they are easy to get and inexpensive.

What a fabulous fabulous idea to use a paper party-blow-horn as a functional  elephant's trunk used in a race to collect tree branches!! Clever!! This is a hilarious party game and a great workout at the same time. It plays up to 4 but can be adjusted to add 1 or 2 more.  Kids would totally love it too.

Crazy, crazy game. 

Shame they didn't keep the original theme suggested by the designer---lizards catching bugs. 

Elephants is okay, but for something this silly, bugs and lizards makes more sense. Not that anyone needs this game to make sense if you see it from across the room!

RATING: 5
Fun to play and can really get everyone laughing, but more of a novelty than anything else.  Set up takes longer than the game itself.  A bit difficult for my 4 y.o. -- she has trouble transferring the mouse branches to other players' mats.  
Definitely buy more party blowers (I have no idea what they're really called) because these will wear out fast with the kids.  Beware if you have storage issues because it's a BIG box.

This is a ridiculous game that I doubt I will ever own in my lifetime but it's here because it's a wishlist! I have played this a few times and it's very fun. I almost spent $90 on this game once but someone outbid me and I couldn't imagine going any higher. Hopefully it'll find it's way into my collection someday.

Update: Found for $60 shipped!! What a happy day! the motor isn't as fast as I think it should be but at least I have it now.

Just... no.  There are many goofy physical games that are actually fun.  The first time you actually wrap a log up in the streamer thing is interesting on an intellectual level.  But you could be playing Attacktix or Crossbows and Catapults or Crokinole.  And the game is too drooly and difficult for actual kids.

Fun party game where you use "tooters" to collect logs from a spinning tree and give the ones with mice on them to your neighbors. Really fun but so hard to find in the states. I found an old broken one on the French Amazon site and manged to get it shipped here and fix the spinning trunk with an old extra Loopin' Louie core :)

Components: amazing, except for the blowing things (in Spanish they are called matasuegras - motherinlawkillers)
Complex: as easy as it can be explained in 5 mns
Weight: family- light
Players: 4
Length: 15 mins
Opinion: amazing game, you have the sunflower with some pieces between its leaves, and you have to take them with the blowing thing and put them on your board. Some of them have bugs behind, and they score negative points, but you can put this on your opponents boards, all done with the blowing thing. And you have to do all of this while the flower is moving around.
It was for a long time that I had such fun with a game of this kind, not that kind of game that you wish to play every time, but playing once in a while ensures you a really fun time and lot of laughs

Good stupid, fun, dex game.  One lady who played said "I feel stupider" with a big smile after several rounds.  The "elephant" trunk pipes you pick up logs with, seem to have a limited life.  Fortunately, these are common at any party store.  If you're a collector of any sort, you might consider just starting with cheapy throw aways, in that case.

Juego muy vistoso con risas garantizadas. A quién se lo saques por primera vez lo dejarás absolutamente fascinado. La primera partida no fuimos capaces de coger practicamente ningún palote pero en la segunda si. Para cinco minutos de risas o para jugar con niños.

Necesario comprar bolsas de matasuegras si vas a jugar con grupos de gente diferente.

A crazy and unique kids / party game. It won't be long before the favors that come with the game get destroyed, though. If you play the game a bit, you will need to get substitutes.

This is very fun to play.  Quick.  Buy extra "trunks" at party stores though and forget about trying to put these things through the dishwasher... the paper just doesn't hold up to many multiple plays.

An amazing idea for a game.  Apparently it was rethemed, but Trotofant reinforces my appreciation for the genius of Roberto Fraga.  Each player is an elephant reaching for branches with her/his trunk (party whistle thing, I don't know what they're called).  You must be careful, as some branches have mice on them (which count as negative points), and other players that mistakenly (or purposefully) take these branches could deposit them on your scoring area.  It's more difficult than it looks to actually pick up the branches.  A lot of fun to play or to watch.  The closest relative I could think of would be Bizzy Buzzy Bumblebees/Bzz Bzz or Snifty Snakes, but this is more fun to play.

Ridiculous fun. Crazier than louie, but also much faster. 
This is a unique and fun game.
Quality material once again from Haba.

After six games , I can call myself an expert :). I can take three tranches at once. Once you know how to move it's very easy.

RATING: 7
The only reason I don't give this an 8 or 9 is because you have to be in the right mood (with the right players) to be wanting to play this.

I stopped playing my first game after 5 seconds because I couldn't stop laughing.

Great fun for people that like stuff like Loopin' Louie.

Oh, and it's supposed to be a good kids game too....

RATING: 8
An extremely light game wherein players use party horns to attempt to pick small cardboard logs off of a spinning centerpiece; each log that you capture and place on a mat in front of you is worth one point.  Some logs, however, are worth -1 points (they have mice on them), and thus it is beneficial to attempt to drop these logs off onto a competitor's mat.  

The game is extremely quick (less than two minutes for all the logs to be picked up), is highly interactive (people are constantly trying to place mice on your mat, while you attempt to defend your mat from such attacks), and is easy to learn.  It's good, light fun, though nobody would confuse it with something like Puerto Rico.

Warning this is not just for kids! This game is nothing short of hilarious! It is simple the tree spins and you must catch the branches in your...trunk...yes trunk, one of those new year's party favors that you blow through and the paper uncurls...yes that's the one! Need I say anymore! Well yes, this game is best played with kids, teens, and adults with a good sense of humor! Not so good with a serious crowd...where you may here crickets chirping! But that in and of itself may be funny too!

Haba game. Revolving machine tree thing that players try to collect sticks using party blowing favors. What else do you need to know? hahaha It is a cute game. I will play again if Scott lugs it around. I am terrible at it but I blame the blower I had was no good.  Fun though!

Silly fun. You're an elephant catching branches with your trunk. By trunk, I mean party hooters (the sort where the paper section expand when you blow). By branches, I mean cardboard bits on a revolving tree. Watch out for those mice!

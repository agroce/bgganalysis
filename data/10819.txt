I grew up playing Chess.  I like the tactical and strategic aspects of Chess.  I don't like the sporty known openings and responses, and the general "known" nature of the game.  At the higher levels it seems that the game is scripted until a certain point, simply because both you and your opponent know the "best way to respond" to a scenario that has been played out thousands of times before.

Navia Dratp is like Chess, but better in almost every way.  The teams are asymmetrical.  There are two different types of pawns.  Your main pieces are each unique, and drawn from a pool of 44 possible pieces.  Your main pieces are also very high quality sculpted, thematic miniatures, each possessing the ability to invoke a special power, add a unique rule, or change it's movement to a superior state.

With 3 distinct ways to win the game (including the "king capture" we all know from Chess), there's more flexibility near the end-game.  Because you have to spend a turn to summon in each main battle piece (none of them start on the board), and each piece gives your opponent a distinct and tangible advantage when it's captured, oftentimes only 4 of your 7 main battle pieces will come into play in any given game.   Imagine how Chess would change if you had 2 more knights instead of bishops - this kind of variability is inherent in Navia Dratp.  Even with just the 14 pieces in the starter sets, each game is unique.

Navia Dratp is more than just "Chess with special powers" - it's a best of breed game.

Years ago someone made a sarcastic comment on r.g.b., about a collectible version of chess.  And this game has answered sarcasm with mastery and excellence.  The collectible chess game with balanced, all-skill game play and ever more variety.

RATING: 9
A superb and grossly underated game similar to chess, but MORE similar to Japanese chess - Shogi. But with the added aspects of promotion of pieces, a large number of different force cominations for each game, and several ways to win. This is really one of the best games ever, marred in my opinion by the anime theme which makes it a little harder for Westerners to accept.

If this had a Lord of the Rings theme it would sell lke hot cakes. BUY IT. It`s brilliant anyway.

RATING: 6
The more I play the more I like it. Still playing with the starter kits and enjoying the challenge. Fixes all the things with chess that make it suck; The fixed starting position which means experts have analysed openings to death. The analysis paralysis of having every piece on the board at once with 50 move lookahead. The boring static movement of pieces. The singular victory %u201Ccheckmate%u201D condition (Navia Dratp has three).
The corny anime theme can be forgiven seeing as it's a Japanese derivative... that aside, I cannot find fault in the mechanics, it's fantastic.

Update: Haven't touched it.

RATING: 9
This isn't really a chess variant, it's a Shogi variant.  I like it.  I like the CMG feel without all the rares and crap (I got almost two full sets of the first expansion with a $30 case of boosters, and a set of the second (and last) expansion with a $30 case of boosters.)

Each character has a movement, a power-upped movement, and possibly a single special ability.  You only have 7 major pieces, which is just enough to have fun creating different flavors of armies with the 44 available pieces. But there isn't the overwhelming feeling I often get with CCGs and CMGs of having too many choices and too many possible power combinations.

Multiple winning conditions also give the game a more open feel than chess.

There is a deduction is for the game's collectability.  I think force customization works great here, but Blind Boosters are still the work of the devil.

RATING: 5
Probably a fun game for those that like chess... I don't.  The quality of cardboard used for the box is poor (very thin and easily "smooshed" if you aren't gentle with it).  The cards are thin, and the game boards don't lay flat.

RATING: 9
Like this one a lot - a nice mix of strategy and tactics during the game, along with army construction at the start too. Shame few others seem to want to play. Multiple routes to vistory are good too - do you collect power, eliminate your opponents bits or play for board position (or probably a bit of all 3) and how do you select your pieces to do that. Only downside is not all the pieces seem balanced, some are definitely weaker than others - and some are just so good you really can't not use them in an army.

** Update, dropped to a 9, just isn't getting played :(

I demo this game for Bandai, which must say something about how much I like it. (Updated: well, I guess I demo it for myself now. But I'm still doing so, in 2009.) I could never get Chess, and got my head handed to me in my 3 games of Shogi, but between the multiple win conditions and money management I found this game to be much more to my liking. I could downgrade it for being collectible, but the sets are so small I hardly notice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Too overwrought for an abstract strategy game. Collecting money to promote pieces seems an unnecessary step. I'd rather play with a point cap per side and have all pieces promote in the same way. I'll stick with Shogi.

I'm not good at this game, but I still love it. A great variation on chess. The pieces look really good. I disapprove of chase pieces in general and only allowing you to use multiples if you scored a chase was lame. They all should have been painted.

A collectible Shogi that's just oozing with style. Unfortunately, two starter sets are required to play. Fortunately, another person in my gaming group is a fanatic and wants to collect everything Navia Dratp, and will also let others play, so I don't need to own it myself! He also has put together an interesting (if somewhat longish) four-player variant.

RATING: 6
I have both starter sets and almost all of the first expansion. I'd like to collect one of each type of figure, since its such a limited number and the cost is not too high.

The game itself is deceptively heavy. It looks like a cartoony anime-themed game with little gemstones and lots of concocted jargon...but once you get the basic rules down you realize there is some tricky decision-making. Its really a heavy assymetric customizable 2-player abstract. 

I played a lot of chess growing up, and I appreciate the need to analyze and develop position like chess. The multiple paths to victory creates a flexibility of strategy that keeps the game fresh. 

I haven't been able to investigate building a customized side yet, but hope to soon. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Interesting concept, marred chiefly by Pokemon-itis- i.e. silly, nonsensical terms, an emphasis on getting the powerup to win the game, and a modified cockfighting theme.  As stated, it's a shogi/chess hybrid with semi-collectible pieces (great sculpts) that feature different movement abilities.  Can get interesting late in the game, but early game has a limited decision tree.  Moving "Gulleds" (pawns) to generate resources is a killer idea.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Got a chance to play this with my usual two player opponent. We both usually play multiplayer games but we also enjoy most of the two player games as well. I like being able to bring your team on as you like. Its somewhat similar to chess but with special moves thrown in. There is a collectable element to it which can be good or bad depending on your taste. This isn't at all necessary to enjoy the basic game. However even the basic game requires both starter sets. This cost me 70 dollars Canadian. The figures are quite large and very nice. Your Queen (King in Chess) comes painted the others aren't. Each peice also cames with a card to show its features and how it could be painted. Played this again at a convention and really had to increase my rating this game is so deep and fascinating.

I got to play this at GenCon 2003.  Neat to see that it actually shipped.  The game has all the annoyance of a collectible minis game while kicking chess in the nards by letting you bring your own guys.  So it is either a weird fantasy minis game where half your guys are flat rocks, or it is playing chess with your little bringer and he brings 4 knights and two rooks.  I'd much rather play Dreamblade; minis are cooler and it doesn't pretend to be chess.

Technically, we really only had a portion of play, as we had to call the first game early (but we knew we were short of time going into it).

For simplicity, we used the two starter sets and just set everything down in numerical order.

Much fun was had, although there is clearly a lot to learn.   If you're not familiar with the moves of your pieces and your opponents, you're going to make some mistakes.

Amazingly, I still won (gyullas wise) despite making what should have been a fatal one.

Navia Dratp is just plain fun.  The game plays quickly -- showing the way the piece moves on the piece itself is very smart and makes it very accessible. We had a party recently and group of six 9-11 year olds pulled it out, learned it, and had a big round robin, and all enjoyed it.

Two big knocks on this game though, that you need to consider:
1) They stupidly did not put enough components in the 'starter' set to play the game -- you actually need to buy two sets, which gives you two boards, rules, etc.  I do not understand this decision, and it makes the cost to get into it much higher than it should be.

2. It's a collectible miniatures game, which I usually find annoying. However there are very few 'extra' pieces in the boosters -- the starter kits give you over 50% of the figs that are out there, so you can have a good game out of the box (or out of the two boxes). Plus the boosters do not duplicate any figs that in the base sets, so you can safely buy one or two without worrying about dupes.

I've decided to rate the game an '8' based on the game itself -- rather than the value or the packaging. But you need to take that into account before buying.

1 play--I loved it.  It's like a Chess game without the static play and setup.  Keeps it from getting rote or boring.

Sadly, my brother HATES it.  I should've checked first--he hates Chess too.

The theme will make it a tough sell to just about anyone else...my game group will reject the anime theme, and anyone who likes Chess is going to distance themselves rapidly from the game with the little monsters and Naruto-looking gals.


*sigh*


This might end up trading away.  I dig it, but it makes for lousy solitaire.


EDIT:  Did indeed trade away.  Nice game, but a dust collector for me; if only I'd had someone to play it who enjoyed it.  Just a bad mesh of mechanics, game type, and theme.

I am so glad this game is dead.  If it were alive, I would like it too much and pay retail, rather than dead CMG prices for its bits.  I think it is wonderful as a game and both intelligent and different each time you play.  I will never have all the fancy figs, and that is fine, as the rarer the figures are, the less they add to the game.  For example, all Navia have the same actions, but each different unpainted figure adds new possibilities.

You have to try this!

Throw in some special abilities and customizable armies into Shogi, and you get a result with so many combinations that you have to play intuitively, while making analytical tactical moves here and there. I love that for an abstract!

The pokemon-esque look is a bit silly, but once deployed, the board is as beautiful and elegant as a deluxe chess board.

I could get all Masetais from the first edition in eBay, but the two starters are also OK to play. Nowadays the game is out of print, so you'll only be able to get a bunch of pieces, and then build armies randomly or drafting. That way, "killer-combos" won't appear and gameplay will be balanced. So don't get afraid by the "collectible" tag.

Picked up 1 of each starter, a case of boosters. I was a strong chess player in high school - gives a slight edge. Starter vs. starter is a high buy-in, but solid. Recommended for chess players who felt that chess was too static.

RATING: 8
I rate this a medium heavy game because it's a very Chess-like game, easy to learn but hard to master. The pieces are pretty interesting and if you don't pay attention to what your opponent's do (different than yours) it will be a short game. I liked it a lot but would only play it with people who don't have AP.

RATING: 8
What a clever little chess (or shogi) variant.  Almost everyone knows how to play chess, and apart from the lame made-up names for certain pieces, this game is easy to teach.
 
I know Navia Dratp is a "collectible" game, but I want to make a quick comment.  I participated in a new player promotion where players got 2 free boosters when buying a starter.  After opening everything, I was 5 pieces away from a set.  A quick trip to E-bay later, and I ended up with the entire first set for a mere $46 for everything, shipping included.  That's not bad at all!

RATING: 8
Amazingly creative chess-based system. You start with nothing on the board but your Navia (king) and your pawns. You draft your other 7 pieces to the board throughout the game and every piece has either a unique movement pattern and/or special ability. You can "drapt" a piece by paying crystals, which often activates the special ability and changes the pieces movement. You gain crystals by moving pawns and capturing your opponent's pieces. With lots of pieces to choose from in the base sets and the two expansions, the variety in combos and game strategies is almost endless. Can be deeply strategic, but powering up gives it a lighter, kick-ass feel. The sculpts are top-notch. It's hard to knock this game.

I never thought I'd see the day where all the bits of a collectible game could be had for under $100, but this is such a game.  I now own every figure released with the game (not including specials like painted and other versions) and invested around $80 to get them all.  Having played Magic in the past, this was a breath of fresh air. 

The game itself is, too.  I really enjoy the game's balance, in that the pieces self-balance based on their dratp cost, so there are theoretically no limits when building a team.  If you want to build a team out of the most expensive and/or powerful figures in the game go ahead!  (You'll probably lose, though)

RATING: 9
An excellent anime-themed chess game with great bits and changing pieces. Ignore what people say about the Japanese terminology being confusing. Its not. You just need to learn 4 or 5 new words. No different from caballeros or castillo, really.

The unpainted pieces look fantastic. They are supposed to be summoned from stone anyway, but even in black shading, the detail is superb. I would say that they look better than the painted Navias. 

Finally, the game itself is excellent. A bit more serious thinking is required, so you'll need to be in the mood, but its a pretty satisfying game.

Although I have come to this game after it had ceased production of any new units, I have quickly become a huge fan.  The theme is not a selling point for me but I really enjoy the game play.  I am an avid (although not particularly good) chess player and this game scratches that itch very nicely.  While it lacks the austere beauty of chess, the special powers of the pieces and the multiple routes to victory go a long way towards making up for some of that loss.  Being able to play this on Vassal as well as face to face means that I should be able to enjoy this one quite a bit.

This gets better everytime I play - real depth, strategy and subtlety.  Still can't win but I really don't mind losing when playing this game.

Have I found my new drug.? It certainly gave me a high once I realised the clever game sytem beneath the corporate marketing and stunning manga pieces.  My hands are getting a bit sweaty thinking about it ... if I was only good at chess / magic the gathering / shogi or had any common sense I might actually win a game then I would be addicted.

Like chess but better!!!  The scupts are quite good, but those pre-painted ones could use a little work.

Very interesting.  It's like Chess++ where the pieces can gain special powers and there are multiple paths to victory.

I especially like the money aspect of the game.  One move may be positionally wise but another move may be more lucrative.  If you get 60 gems you win on your next turn by dratping your king.


I LOVE the concept but pretty much hate the art style.

Wow! It's been said before, but I'll repeat: what a great game!

The terminology is terrible. Personally, I'd rather just use a deck of cards instead of chunky plastic figures to make the whole thing more compact and portable. But both complaints are just minor nits about the presentation.

After playing the game itself, you are immediately struck by how rich and deep and varied the strategies are. Fantastic!

Expansions owned:
* Resurgence
* Unleashed Darkness
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Here's an absolutely terrific blend of strategy and fantasy: in what seems like a reduced Shogi setup, an array of "Gulled stones" protect the Navia (the player's main piece), who can in her turn invoke new special pieces (Maseitai) to be placed on the board. By moving the Gulled stones and eliminating pieces of the opponent, crystals are gathered, which can be used to enhance the abilities of a Maseitai or "upgrade" the Navia. A win is achieved either by this upgrade, by the rival Navia being taken or surrendered, or by the Navia reaching the opponent's back line if no Maseitai are remaining.

The game itself is easy to grasp and very smooth, but at the same time difficult to master. The possibility of customising the player's own roster of Maseitai means even more replayability (these are/were collectable... why figures came hidden in the expansion boxes seems more like a trick to get easy money to me, actually... maybe the game would have settled better if players hadn't had to buy lots of boxes to get all the collection, especially considering that both starter sets already give a hell of a play). And last but not least the production values are extraordinary, with miniatures and board as detailed and user-friendly as possible.

I love chess ... and this is one of the best "chess variants" I have tried ... reminds me of the Edgar Rice Burroughs Martian Chess (chained and unchained pieces et al.) ... but this version seems to have smoothed out some of the conflicts and added some very nice features. However, the "names" they use for some of the pieces, movements, actions and "gold" are almost unpronouncable (IMHO). Still ... a solid 9 in my book.

Revised downward after more plays. I don't think with only 24 pieces this game should be "collectible," and the whole thing with painted figures as super-rares is lame as heck.  The game is a terrific idea and smooth but often time becomes either repetitive or stuck (due to figure combinations).

Fantastic.  A triumph for fans of Shogi in particular and anime in general.  Amazing sculpts on pieces.  Collectable element is a pretty big turn off, but hopefully will lead to interesting expansions.

Updated score:  Kind of a wash.  Was fun at first, but the frustratingly impossible to get full color set always made me feel like I was playing with a beta game.  Expansions might've come, but interest had long since past by that point.  A shame.  Another clever idea destroyed by a collectable miniature-phobic game buying public and silly "it's got to be as big as Pokemon" corporate ideology.  I basically don't buy Bandai games anymore.  Pointless.

Have played a couple of times. It's like chess, but with cool minis and powers! I think with a regular opponent this could be really, really good. 

One downside is trying to figure out how to store everything. The boxes on the starter sets aren't made to be kept at all. I have all the minis just piled in a toolbox with all the other bits for now. If I ever get some boosters, I'll need to find a new place for the gameboard.

An excellent and original variation on chess.  Clever rules, figures are well-made, bits are great.  It seems like there can be a great imbalance in army building; if your army doesn't account for your opponent's great combo, then you're toast.  Also, too bad it's limited to two players.

Beautiful pieces, enjoyable meeting of anime and chess. Advantage over chess is that it has to play quicker, as players win goolyhoo stones for every capture. I think it's a mistake to view this as making a better game, but can certainly be more fun for lighter play.

It looks so good that it makes all other CMGs look pathetic by comparision. The detail on the miniatures are incredible. The unpainted navias look better IMHO. 

Gameplay is decent too. Very tense and fairly fast playing. You have some inspiration from chess and checkers but you get the variation of drafting teams of creatures with different movement effects to allow for different tactics. Pity it's expensive and hard to find.

This game is indeed cool. The miniatures are WAY better than heroscape. I'm not a miniature expert but minis were quite big and just gave me the wow's.
the game is like Shogi or Chess. Quite a bit of brain burning. Experienced players definately have edge over beginners. But don't get me wrong- the rules are very simple. It's just that there are so many possible strategies.

I thought this game would be really stupid (the language that they paste on each kind of piece is absurd), but as I was playing it I saw that there was a real game here.  It certainly wasn't one that I loved, but it did offer some fun tactical and strategic decisions.  Then the anti-climactic supported teleport checkmate happened, and I realized this game was not for me.  

Dude, check out this AWESOME power combo that works everytime!  

I guess knowing that there is a potential for that every game means that I have to prepare for it, but it just doesn't seem worth the effort knowing that I have to expend moves to eliminate an obvious killing move strategy, nor would I want to play the side that should be setting up for that move every single game.

I do have to say it was fun screaming out the retarded names as you summon the pieces though...

Played my first game last night.  The components are definate eye-candy and I enjoyed the game play.  I noticed that the starter set boxes have an alternate picture of the game board.  Theirs pictures a game mat, where the actual playing area is a board.

I look forward to many more plays.

I'm not a fan of chess, so I wasn't sure about this game at first. After playing it all my doubts are erased. It adds depth that chess doesn't have. The cost for a collectable game is the only downside.

Navia Dratp is an extremely interesting perfect information strategy game. The diverse victory conditions, plus the wide variety of abilities for the various pieces, provide a rich decision tree for both strategic and tactical play.

(Note that two starter sets, one red and one blue, are required to play. Another 30 figures were released in two waves, called Unleashed Darkness and Resurgence, of 15 figures each. These can be substituted for figures in the starter sets, to provide variety - by the official rules, one painted and one unpainted figure of each type can be used. I own all the unpainted figures, a few of the painted ones, and also some alternate Navia figures and a vinyl play mat, which are fun to have but don't affect play.)

Collectible fantasy shogi! I love asymmetrical abstracts and this is the best I've seen. The pieces are pretty great too, though made of relatively cheap plastic. The designs are quite disturbing, actually -- much less cartoonish than I expected.

Until it crashed and burned, the idea was that the game would run like a CCG/TCG; instead of a deck, you'd field a set of pieces. I only have the starter sets (dudes 1-14), so I have to have them all in play at once. 

The design is ever so slightly clunky: you can win by capturing the opponent's [-]king[/-]navia, but you also accrue points during the game. Points can also be spent to "dratp" your pieces -- more or less the same as a normal shogi promotion, but doesn't have to be on the back rank -- or, if you get enough, by dratping your navia (hence the game's ridiculous name) to win. It's not a problem, but polluting an abstract with this sort of inelegant accounting element is something like a crime.

The biggest problem with the game is that it takes the analysis paralysis typical with chess variants and cranks it up to eleven. There are a large number of unique pieces, so it's hard to remember what they all do; because they're double-sided, you have to try and track what's possible now [i]and[/i] what could be possible with a judicious dratp. Unless you play a lot, you'll spend a lot of time looking at reference material.

Hot damn, this is a fine, fun, strategic and tactical delight. Collectible chess. The best part is the money system, where you move pawns to earn Navia Bucks (Gyulla) then spend those bucks to up grade your characters. What a concept! 

If you like the idea of chess, but aren't willing to make a career out of it, this is the game for you.

Update: As close to gaming perfection as I'm likely to see. Worthy of a 10.

Despite the "collectable miniatures game" on the box, this is NOT a minis game.  Its abstract strategy that happens to have spiffy figures.  Not bad at all - plays like chess, only fun! (Ok, nothing wrong with chess, but I find it rather tedius.  This has more variety and is faster paced).  There is no need for this to be collectable though.

This is a fantastic game that is similar to chess, but with a bunch added on that make the game fun.  The board starts fairly empty, and the players decide when to bring their pieces on and in which order.  There is an economy to control, and pieces can promote.  I really enjoy this game!

Based on a game with Starter Set 1&2. It's a neat little alternative to chess. In fact, I was hoping for it to be a little less chess-like with the focus heavier on the fantasy aspect. Will need more play to see if the balance is well done.

Despite its appearances, this is a real brainburner. Not that dissimilar in feel to western chess (do not know the Japanese version), in that it pays to try and think a few moves ahead. Unlike chess, however, the ground rules take a little longer to explain, and it takes about half a game to get familiar with the special abilities of your and your opponent's pieces.
That said, the game I played, while taking some time to play, was most rewarding. More rewarding, in fact, than any other collectible game I played in the past. It just felt so...balanced! I am glad I added this to my collection.

I actually like this game!! Surprise surprise!! I don't like chess. So, I must say I was pleasantly surprised that Navia Dratp turns out to be more exciting than I expected. The special powers of all the Masetai really makes it unique. The ability to call in the right powers at the right time is key and really can turn the tide of events. I believe that with several boosters and a couple more characters to draft, this game will shine and with lots of replayability.

RATING: N/A
This chess-like game is inspired by Shogi  and themed around an anime style. Players set up different armies by purchasing booster packs of randomly-inserted miniatures. These are are summoned onto the board one-at-a-time during play, and can be promoted to a more powerful chess movement using currency crystals. Most figures have special "magic" powers, that work outside of what we normally expect the rules of chess to be, such as teleportation, resurrection, or capturing a piece without moving to it.

Everything about Navia Dratp is strange. The theme is apparently something about weird anime soldiers that fight for disturbingly sexy fairies dressed in Catholic school girl uniforms. Some of the creatures represented are down right silly, almost Season 4 Pokemon bad. The miniatures themselves are generally very well sculpted and the modified chess board on which the game is played is both attractive and functional. On the other hand, all but a few ultra rare figures are left unpainted. A disappointing shortcut, considering the extremely high price tag of this collectible game.

The strangeness doesn't stop there. Navia Dratp has all kinds of weird impossible to pronounce terms for simple chess terms like pawn and promote. I suppose the purpose was to distance itself from chess, and try to create something unique. The language and terminology are silly, but thankfully the gameplay itself hits on all cylinders.

I've never been much of a chess player, and never really desired to become one. Chess has always given me the impression of being scripted, with victory going to the player who had memorized the most strategy books. Even if that is a gross generalization, I still have never been interested enough to try and master it. That's why I like Navia. It seems to fix everything I perceive to be wrong with chess. Armies are customized, so symmetrical game play goes right out the window. While movement is very chess like, pieces typically threaten many more spaces making for a very dynamic board. This provides for much deeper brain burn, as well as challenging player's turn by turn decision making. There are also multiple win conditions, which add yet another layer of strategy and further help to differentiate Navia from standard chess.

This is a great game, one that never really achieved any momentum because it was:

A) Unpainted in the era of the Wizkids pre-painted miniatures revolution and

B) Obscenely expensive. $30 bucks for HALF of a starter game and another 12 bucks or so for a 3 figure booster?...yuck.

Fortunately, for those interested, the game can now be had for a quarter of those prices, which is all the more reason to give it a try! You won't be disappointed, at least not until you realize there are no more pieces to be had...

Why isn't this game re-themed as a Pokemon game? Such a strong abstract. Play with a drafting element at the beginning of the game, and play with 4 or 6 players and it's a fantastic game.

Wow... this game is a lot deeper and more challenging than I would have initially thought it would be.  When I bought it, I thought, "this could be chess-lite" but after one play through I find the opening moves especially to be really a series of interesting and tough choices.  So far I'm very impressed and am curious to see how a few booster packs expand the game.

I HATE "collectible components" games; when I buy a game, I want to have the bloody game. Even if there is an inherent relative advantage for one side or the other built into the game, I want to inherently know what I'm dealing with. NB: This note is primarily for myself so I know not to buy the game in spite of being an avid chess and shogi player. Those wihout my game preferences may well like the game.

This is a very nice half-breed of the chess family of games.  The fact that you start the game with a Navia and 9 Gulleds (soldiers/pawns) on the board, but all your powerful pieces have to be summoned (for free) is interesting enough.  However, saving up resources (Gyullas) to enable Dratping (promoting) units is a fascinating element to the strategy.  I won my first game by saving up all 60 Gyullas, getting my Navia well out of check, and then spending the 60 for a Navia Dratp to win.  Rather interesting!

For me, Navia is a step up from chess due to multiple win conditions and choice of pieces to use.  There is quite a bit of variety in the 44 pieces that were released.  It can be purchased cheaply with very little effort.

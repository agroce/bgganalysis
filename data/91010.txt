RATING: 6
I have a love/hate relationship with this game.  On the one hand, it is very much a detailed conflict simulation and that's what attracts me to wargames as a genre.  Phantom Fury accounts for all of the variables you might reasonably expect to cover in a detailed simulation of this harrowing urban battle.  In so doing, however, it leaves the player with a roll-fest when resolving all of the variables.  While it taught me much about the conflict and the horrible conditions faced by the US Marines in November 2004 (for which I'm appreciative), as a game, I think it plays like a giant probability equation.

Very good solitaire system. You fight your way through the city: house to house, floor to floor and in the streets. Works very well. Hard to win.

Played twice til now, and still 10 locations away from victory.
My tactics get more appropriate last time, but a 4star martyr confused the Marine assault three times before blowing itself with a suicide bomb the fourth time and definitely ruined my day.
Very immersive game, a bit repetitive though. Replayability is pretty good.

Overall, I'm enjoying playing the game.  It is tough, and I have yet to win with the Marines.  One needs both luck and good tactics to clear the blocks.  And you'll always get pinned crossing the road, even if only 1 "Suspect" marker is firing, LOL!  It's easy to enter the mindset of the U.S. commander -- you have a job to do, but you also want to limit casualties.  Tough choices. 

The game does have a feeling of "sameness" after a while, as you are doing the same things, turn after turn.  The rules could have been organized better, as I still find myself referring to them often, looking for one buried tidbit.  Also, the colors for the 2 sides look very similar.  The Insurgent side should have been much different (Islamic Green would have been perfect).  So, not perfect, but definitely a purchase I am happy with.

Interesting and elegant puzzle game on MOUT (or FIBUA as the Brits say) in Iraq. Rules are pretty simple on the face of it, but include some subtleties, and the phasing will be familiar to any SL players. Provides a tough race against the clock, with enough randomness thrown in to ensure that your plan will not survive contact with the enemy. Some neat chrome as well, including events, US aerial assets (which are not a sure thing, and can cause problems if postponed) and optional reinforcements. Infiltration can make the player's job very hard, and you face some tough decisions as to when to employ limited assets, and when to take risks crossing the streets. Impressed

Polished design, very good quality, excellent customer service, a BGG game designer. I would give an higher vote, but there is a single scenario (with an historical variant), so longevity is not very high. But I'm happy to have this game.

Unbelievably high production value. Clearly the work of someone who knows print production.

Small errors owing to using Franglais instead of English, but nothing too serious ("PM" in the diagrams for "movement points"; "assimilated with USMC units" when describing IIF units instead of "are treated as".

Three plays in, still no victory. Think I'm getting a little bored, but I've played tacticals since 1979. That said, PF is a *great* introduction to tactical gaming. It will teach you a bunch of concepts that will make learning other tacticals much easier. Seems heavily based on ASL's notion of what MOUT looks like: the phasing is almost the same. Would have liked more of a departure from that.

Just finished my 2nd game of Phantom Fury, this time I had a strategy (or was it because I threw out the dice that kept throwing 1s & 0s!) and so things went a lot more smoothly and on turn 15 (2nd last turn), the Marines won a decisive victory clearing out the last hole up martyrs with 11 VPs. It was a reasonably close run thing, it came down to the last building in the upper right corner. There was an injured (combat factor 4) uniting facing the enemy, and a couple of bad dice throws could've lost the game. It doesn't matter that I didn't lose a single unit in the whole game, an army of marines wouldn't have helped, since the rules prevent more than one squad to enter an insurgent control area to minimize friendly fire. So it was this weaken unit or bust.

I definitely recommend adding in ALL the fortify building markers for a much tougher challenge. I added only two in this game and both were taken out with support from the helicopters, too easy for those on the ground.

Infiltration is easy to prevent by presenting a continuous front as you progress through the blocks. You can use reduced units (that you don't want to risk losing) or the Iraqi troops (they can't attack anything but the mosque any how.) to fill in any gaps. 

Oddly, I found combat fire not all that useful, the fact that snipers can get a shot at you is pretty bad! Not really worth the risk. I only used it with the tanks (which are immune) whenever they didn't have to move this turn. 

Crossing the roads where the tanks are is the safest (you ignore suspects and step losses!), but you can get a reasonably safe crossings at the edges of the map where your men are exposed to less neighborhoods. Also, you can use your tanks to shield your crossings in two different street-sections per turn by moving men across the tank before the tank moves and then in another street-section after the tank moves.

Secure a neighborhood before moving onto another to prevent gaps from occurring that may result in infiltration.

Good game. Going to play again tonight with more fortify building markers, the rule book says to add in 1-4 markers (to adjust difficulty) but the game comes with 6... I think I will add all six in this time....

RATING: 8.5
Only in to my 2nd game of this but I'm really enjoying it.  The rules aren't difficult to digest but there are many little nuances to remember; "this might happen if this happens first" type of thing.  One concern is replayability as others have mentioned but it could take several playings to get to that point.  This is a difficult game to win given the parameters of the victory conditions. The other concern is the repetitive nature of the game- clearing zone after zone only to get down to the "nail biter" towards the end where the clock is running out and you still have some work yet to do.

Edit to add:  There is no winning formula that I've found nor do I think that there could be one because the game is so luck driven; you'll never face exactly the same situation twice which does add to replayability but if you dislike such randomness you may not like this game.  There are some tactics that can be used though despite what you may be facing including when to leave security elements and how to best utilize the M1A1 and weapons teams as well as the limited assets that you have at your disposal.  This is the type of game that you'll play 3 or 4 times in a row trying to either win or more likely, to best your previous attempts and then you'll tire of it a bit and set it aside as I have but just talking about it again has me itching to set it back up - which is another positive, set up is fairly quick so you can rip through a few playings of it in short order.

Hmm....a U.S. operation simulation by a French.  The map is divided the city of Fallujah into areas for search and destroy operation.  A solitaire exercise into modern day counter-insurgency city fighting. Relevant, realistic, and insightful to today's military operations.

Phantom Fury is, in a word, BRILLIANT.

As a solitaire wargame it's one of the very best, it's unbelievably tense, graphically pretty, fairly simple to learn and with so many decisions and a feel for the subject that it's a masterpiece. I've owned this since 2012 and every time I pick it up again I am stunned by the elegance of the system but also how true it is to the subject. If you've read about the Second Battle of Fallujah - Operation Phantom Fury in books such as "House to House", "We Were One", "No True Glory" then this game will just jump out at you whilst playing it. A masterstroke of this system is that it was designed around a Marine Corps thesis on an evaluation and study of the urban combat in Fallujah, as a result this is a game entirely truthful and realistic to its subject matter. Horrendously tense, difficult, and one of the atmospheric solitaire wargames out there. This is one game where running across a street with you squads or clearing a building is about as tense and nerve-racking as a boardgame can get.

A truly wonderful game!

Make no mistake: for all of the friction in the form of hidden information, random events, etc., this is still very much a puzzle game. The USMC player has very near *precise* control over his units, allowing him to finesse each individual tactical situation. As skill increases I suspect the game grows more (not less) frustrating, since you KNOW what the correct play is supposed to be but the dice aren't cooperating.

All of that said, it is undeniably addictive and a great story generator. A system that knows what it wants to do and succeeds in doing it. The English rules are excellent and I have no trouble telling the counters apart.

There is a lot abstracted about this game and the combat it portrays but it is also a tough game to play!  The insurgents can really kick your butt and having to capture every block in the short time period really means you haver to go go go!

RATING: 6.5
I many ways a simple, nifty game of block clearing against a time limit. If there's any strike against it, it is that it is a fraction overlong and repetitive. Once you have the basic tactics down it's a matter of rinse and repeat until the time has counted down. I can't help feeling that this might have worked better as a smaller magazine game.

Man, I really wanted to like this game.  The graphics looked great, the map was cool, the rules simple enough, what's not to like.

Well for me it was the game play.  It didn't hold my interest.  Very repetitious in nature.  Move into a building clear out the insurgents either by killing them or they retreat. Rarely will they get you cause their fire power is so low.  They can pin you down or do a step loss with sniper fire when possible.  Then on to the next building and I think there are 60 of these?  Same thing each time.  

There was no conflict for me like in a good war game. The game seems to rely on a time limit and speed to win, not conflict.  So if you are looking for a race, this would be a good one for you.

After two plays, I'm not sure about liking or not liking the game. Production value is outstanding. Rulebook is a treat (although some questions remain). There are some very intriguing mechanics in the game and it surely needs more than one or two plays to be fully understood and rated. What I don't like is that the game becomes repetitive rather fast and the limited strike back possibilities of the insurgents (although probably accurate). Minor negative points are that both sides look very similar and some clarifications in the rules are needed. For now I have put PF back on the shelf. I'll read the two books about the battle of Fallujah that are highly recommended and give PF another try afterwards. Promised.

    Fantastic game. If you've read the books We Were One, and House to House, you realize once you're playing this game, how true to those books this game is.

  The counters are super-thick, the map holds everything you'll need during the course of the game, and it looks really good.

  Plus, the game has everything: "Top-down" assaults by US Marines, running across streets under fire for "bottom-up" assaults, M1A1's, Predators, Cobras, Hornets (both for close air support), Iraqi Intervention Forces (to assault the mosque, since US forces cannot enter it due to political issues).

  I can't say enough about this game! One of the best I have bought in the last six months.

I've had this game for almost four years and I still love it; it's one of my all time favorites. This is a unique design that is tailored to this specific battle and its tactical challenges, rather than being shoehorned into a preconceived notion of how a wargame should work. Great map and counters. Rule book is quite good considering the pitfalls of translation. In all PF is pretty close to an ideal solitaire wargame for my tastes.

Intriguing little game with interesting mechanics. The subtleties of the system don't really hit you until you've attempted it a few times. It's a hard slog for the jarheads (especially if, like me, you just went Gung Ho right off with 4 Strong Points in the mix). Infiltration is a killer so watch your back...especially if you get a squad stuck in the street from a Pin result. Definitely something I'll pull out and play since it's solo.

RATING: 8
12-03-14: Wow, this game came out of nowhere for us. I reluctantly listed it as a potential math trade and of course ended up with it. But everyone we've played it with has really liked it/loved it, even several of my friends who really don't like deck builders anymore. This game probably kills Dominion for good for us.

02-04-15: In not even three months, this has risen to the top 5 of the most played games in our collection. I really enjoy playing it. I love the theme, of course. It plays very quick. There is a lot more variety and options available to you compared to other deck builders like Dominion. And as I hinted a few months ago, we ended up giving away all of our Dominion sets to a family member, so it did kill Dominion for us.

The high rating relates to the supremely enjoyable 2 vs 2 variant outlined in the rule book. The game is the best balanced of the three currently released that use the engine. If you are going to have one of Cryptozoic's games in your collection, make it this.

Nice deck-building game!  My only complaint is that it seems to suffer from the "victor goes to the winner" problem, where the person who starts building their deck well at the beginning has the advantage later.

A super easy to teach and learn and play game.  Thematically makes no sense, but decent game for a deckbuilder.  Very quick to set-up, so that earns it bonus points and why I reach for it over Legendary almost every time.

RATING: 6
It's an easier (and better) version of Ascension. You have to get in the mood for it to work as it plays quite fast and breezy. You're not playing a single hero - you're essentially directing a comic book. I liked it actually, but there are some cards that feel way over powered and it's luck if you get a chance at them with the right cards in your hand. Over all, not great, kinda meh. I can pass and won't being buying it.

*Rating based on one play.

It's decent as far as deckbuilders go, but it has very little in the way of theme.  Yes, a few of the cards feel thematic, but playing as Wonder Woman who has heat-ray vision and is teamed up with Poison Ivy just takes away any sense of theme.

For a game that actually feels like a comic-book battle, I like Sentinels of the Multiverse.  For a deckbuilder with more thematic feel, I like Legendary better than this one.  The DC DBG isn't bad, it just isn't anything exciting.  It could have had any other theme and not changed at all (see: the Lord of the Rings DBG).

A solid deck builder with a slot machine flop, punch economy, and comic book theme. While the randomness can be a turn off for some, I find that this is a deck builder that I can get to the table pretty often. It sets up fast, can be taught even faster, and doesn't over stay its welcome... Most of the time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
7/10 when playing with variant house rules that allow for solo and cooperative play. The problem I have is why are the designers/cryptozaic not including these variant rules in the box? Also, the game is just too simple. Dominion generally has more appeal and is an all round better introductory deck building game.  There just isn't enough decision making in the game unfortunately.

It's a good deck-builder. There's a theme, but thematically it doesn't make that much sense (your deck will end up consist of heroes, villains, and equipment that belong to various heroes). Still, it's easy to learn (although I'd say Dominion is easier), and it's not a bad game overall.

This game is close to an 8 for me. The game doesn't do anything super-new, but it's the first deckbuilder I've played where I had a personality to my deck that made it steer in a different direction than the other decks (other than Starcraft & Mage Knight). The game was simple to teach, thematic (although I hate DC super heros), and enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting deckbuilding game with very good theme that fits well in the deckbuilding purpose, but other than that, there are a lot of issues that makes this game a little poor. First of all, the super villains grants even more power to the ones that defeat them, so they get even richer as the poor gets poorer, that's not a good thing, and the superpowers other than the basic for every character are not very thematicly accurate.

RATING: 7
A pretty obvious Dominion clone, but with some positive changes. The card design is excellent, with each superhero's cards fitting in extremely well with their deck without being too restrictive(for example, Batman gets a bonus to using equipment, all of Batman's gear is equipment, Robin lets you re-use equipment, and the Batcave lets you draw when you use equipment). The lineup is also an interesting change, giving you more variance in your deck. 

However, the overall flow of the game is very jumpy. There's a long phase of buildup, where the game roadblocks on an expensive supervillain, and then once they go down it's over almost instantly. I think it would play much better if the supervillains were sorted by cost, at least somewhat. It's also unfortunate that virtually every card is worth VP, because you lose the tension of having to choose whether to improve your deck's power level or its VP total, and instead just scramble to get as much stuff into your deck as you can.

Based on one play, I found it very un-thematic and annoying in the same way Dominion is sometimes annoying, but worse. It's hard to plan a turn because everyone's cards screw with everyone else's. Much prefer Marvel Legendary and Sentinels of the Multiverse; will probably not buy this.

RATING: 5
It's a Cryptozoic game, so they're all similar deck-building games with a different IP draped over it. Theme doesn't really match the play that well either, since you can field a hand of villain and hero cards at the same time with not much explanation as to why. Fairly high chance of someone running away with the game because so many of the non-supervillain cards are worth the same amount of points, so anyone who can take down a supervillain gets a big surge in points.
If you like deck-building games, and like certain universes/properties, pick whichever in the Legendary/Cryptozoic games is a match, but the Legendary ones tend to be more popular.

An okay game that suffers from its theme having very little to do with what is actually printed on the cards.  Decisions aren't particularly interesting once the game is in stride, and the starting heroes aren't particularly balanced.

Will play very occasionally, but not interested in picking up.  Thunderstone Advance and Dominion take the deckbuilder cake for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

reasonably thematic.  There are a lot of decisions and player interaction for a deck builder. Luck plays a large part of this game

An extremely easy to teach fast paced card game game. New players just love it. Very fast and intense games that come down to wire between all players. Great sense of progression and powering up. 

It's just Perfect for the DC Superheroes theme. Heroes teaming up to take down super villains. Play as your fav heroes with unique abilities.

Far easier to setup and put away than Marvel Legendaary (not a hassle). Ability to attack/interact with other players also better than Marvel.

Lacks random fun events or game mode variety.

Very good mechanics and very fun game to play.

You know, I was not really expecting to like this very much, but it's actually a really fast, fun game, with the caveat that you have to mentally 'abstract' a little bit. Don't think of each card drawn into your deck as belonging to your hero, but as a sort of 'assist' that would show up in comic form. Strange, maybe, but the game is just so fluid and intuitive to learn, one of the sleekest deck builders I've got alongside Star Realms. Legendary is probably better at theme because you set up the individual scenarios, but this compensates with speed, fun and little footprint necessary.

RATING: 7
This game is a simple deck building game with special abilities that each hero provides to customizing a deck. Although you don't necessarily have to follow the constructed concept of benefiting from the hero, it's a plus to do so (e.g. Wonder Woman going after villains). This game is very simplistic. That might be where the downfall is: the game is TOO simplistic. For a deck builder, this game can kill an hour to two hours, but after a few playthroughs, the game becomes quicker (unless you have that one slow player for every game). All in all, this game isn't bad, but it isn't the best either. There could be a few tweaks to make this game a lot better: complexity, more varieties of cards, or anything to make this game require more thought than buying power. With that said, I wouldn't turn down a game if asked to play, but if there are better options, I would definitely take the other picks.

RATING: 7
A simple deck-builder featuring those familiar DC superheros. The theme isn't really there, but that doesn't really bother me and deck-builders are just soulless euro VP engine anyway. And unlike Ascension, having one currency means you are never screwed by having all attack or all buy cards. A potential problem is that character powers might be imbalanced. So, for example, one game where my opponent played Batman and I played 'Cyborg' (apparently a real superhero and not a stand-in character in another story), my opponent got eight supervillains and I got ... none. Yeah.

What makes the DC deck-builder such a popular superhero game, despite its third-position standing behind Legendary Marvel and Sentinels of the Multiverse in the eyes of critics? It all comes down to raw fun and accessibility -- throw it down, get playing, and have a blast! The art is fantastic, the game is simple and super-fun, and it's easy to make adjustments to the game length. An unexpected favorite!

I think my brother and I have played this to the point of exhaustion. I picked it up an amazing Amazon sale and because it's DC. It ended up being the formal introduction to deck-building for myself, my wife, and my brother.

As we exhausted the base game and felt it thematically didn't work out we grabbed a much needed expansion pack.

Thematically, this game does nothing. Being a deck-builder that's a big deal. There isn't much else for the game to do other than build on theme.

Somehow we enjoy this and it will continue to get played. If the price is right, we may even acquire other versions of the game and more expansions.

Too many plays to now start listing, I did not buy this until Crisis as I had access to it otherwise. The Cerberus engine games while not straight up my favorites, are fun lite romps that seem to excel when game specific mechanics are grafted on. In that I think lies the inherent strength of any game based on this engine. Pre-Crisis, no money spent, post; I could not get this one in fast enough it lives in the box and I am not sure I will ever separate my sets out as this is now my preferred way to play. I will stick a few plays in here just so it looks closer to legitimate, but I have more than two dozen playing this one for sure, even about a half dozen solo plays of crisis! its worth it and a solid game.

Not a bad game in and of itself, it just lacks the strategy of many other deckbuilders. There's far too few ways to remove cards from your own deck, and plenty of ways to gain bad cards. Most of my play experience has been nothing more than buying something because it's the best thing out there, and ending the game with half my deck starter cards and bad cards.

Still, it's fast and easy to teach, so it has that going for it.

Played this at CZE Store during SDCC weekend and I loved it.

Quick round up:

Basic Deckbuilding games rules with a Refreshing line up of cards and a Hero per player.

Each hero gives a specific ability to the players, from putting bought cards on top of deck to +1 power when using X or Y cards

Cards can be Hero, Villain, equipment, super power and location cards, all with different effects and costs.

Also beside the line up is the supervillains deck, the main objective in the game, when this ones are totally bought the game is over... but they are not just there to be pretty, when a player buys a supervillain the next on in the deck has a special effect that goes into play, players can defend using some specific cards, but it will not always happen, making it interesting.

Overall the game is great and simple to get a hang of it, I'm pretty sure deckbuilding veterans will find a good challenge here and new players will get into it at a fast pace...

Now I just want it home!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Overall: Game that started it all for the DC DBG. It has a lot of issues with Card balance compared to later games, but it's a solid first attempt and worth playing on it's own, and probably the easiest version of the game to mix with Crossover sets.

Main Deck: Hard to really complain about the set outside of Bizarro, & Man of Steel being too problematic especially in mixed games. A lot of cards in this set just push out advantage, such as the locations being a draw engine,  Robin into Bat-Signal, etc. 

Super-Villains: They're weak in this set in terms of earning them, and how quickly the game ends, but all of them have solid effects, and pretty balanced overall (with the exception of Parallax).

Over-Sized Super Hero Cards: All of them, with the exception of Flash are great in mixed games. Cyborg, Aqua man, Green Lantern are still considered first picks in all mixed sets, almost problematically so.

Good beginners intro to deck building game. The theme is off (Superman recruiting the Batmobile?). The other downside is the lack of an offical solo variant. Finally the fact that you use one HUGE deck for the draw is super annoying to shuffle... especially when sleeved.

RATING: 5
Tempted to give this a three or a four, but I do have to admit that this game does have a place as an intro to deck-building for a fan of DC comics. 
For me, I cant give this more than a five though because of how this game falls into the same trap as the Penny Arcade game, namely once someone defeats the first super-villian in particular when the first player is able to take advantage of their first crack at the "line-up" to run away with the game.
To make matters worse, after two plays (one two-player, one three-player) I have the distinct feeling that the game is playing me and there are only a minimal number times to make choices and its debatable whether even those few choices have any effect on the game's outcome. Strangely, this is what a lot of the complaints about Ascension, but in my opinion are mostly unfounded, and I find this game takes "the game playing me" and "my choices have no effect" to the extreme.

In DC Deck Builder you are heroes trying to prove who is the best hero. That may seem slightly weird, and the theme can be broken if you think too hard about why Aquaman is being helped by Lex Luthor and Bane, but for all you know it could be Earth 723123, so quit asking questions beyond your pay grade! 

DC Deck Builder was close to(if not) the first tabletop game to which I was introduced. At the time I had watched a few episodes of Tabletop and had grown a crush on the out of print Betrayal at House on the Hill and the lovely Felicia Day... not necessarily in that order but probably in that order.

When being explained a deck builder I instantly made the totally unjust connection to Magic the Gathering. (In 1993-1994 I played Magic and really enjoyed it right until I realized that the more money you spent on it the better your deck and in turn the better your chance of winning. It kinda takes the fun out of a game when you realize that the solution to winning is just 50 bucks away. As a 7th grader, 50 bucks was a long way away.) My worries were soon rectified when I was told that everything you need to play, and can play with, is contained in the box. No chase of rare cards. No buckets of money thrown towards finding exactly what you needed to crush your friends. 

DC Deck Builder is a Ascension style deck building game
with what I view as a few major improvements. An Ascension style deck builder has each player start with the same cards(their deck) and a lineup of five random cards thrown out(from a lineup draw pile, and replenished from said pile when one is acquired) which they can purchase to improve their deck and/or give them victory points. Most victory points at the end of the game wins. 
The improvements DC brings are;
-One solitary buy power. No need to choose between money and fighting. No turns wasted as your hand is stacked with one buy power and the lineup stacked the other way. 
-The addition of character roles. Each person gets a little flavor, whether you are Cyborg or Wonder Woman, you get a special unique ability only to you.
-The addition of Super Villains. These cards stay out in the lineup as a 6th card and get their own draw pile. The first one never attacks, but once they are defeated a random new one comes out and attacks everyone with an attack stipulated on the villain's card.

A downside to the game is the literacy factor which every deck builder suffers from. Not everyone wants to read each card and see exactly what they do differently for roughly 200 cards in a game. The more you play, the more identifiable the cards are so it becomes a non-factor, but the first few games can be somewhat slow as everyone reads every card that comes out.

I love this game. It gives me the feel of a Magic style game without the chase for cards. The random attacks from Super Villains throw in enough of a wrench that each game play is different. With one buy power it's pretty simple to teach. Cryptozoic has simply cranked out expansions which all change the flavor of the game by simply adding a few cards and changing the character cards. 

*I house rule that the card Man of Steel be removed from the game. In almost every game I've played with it in the lineup deck, the player that gets it cruises to victory. Just something I wanted to add encase someone is actually reading this and interested in the game.

Simple, straightforward deckbuilding.  The theme sells it, lots of fun even though we don't recognize a bunch of the characters.  I'd shied away from this after the Dice Tower review - they were wrong, it's a fun entertaining game.  Quick to set up, easy to learn, I prefer it over Legendary I think.

1 play, 2 players. Works fine, I like it more than Legendary: Marvel, which it always gets compared to even though they're really not all that similar. I like the simplicity of this, though I doubt it will ever be a favourite.

I'm curious to try the NHL version now.

RATING: 5.5
This was fun enough that I wanted to play it a second time. It's really just Dominion meets Ascension plus a new theme. It's neat how if you buy cards thematically, the deck you build works really well together, but Batman playing heat vision is a bit dumb. I don't really like superhero comics, but in this case even I noticed the thematic gaps.

The game is an example of cashing in on a lucrative license to sell a fairly lacklustre product. See, for example, how similar the Lord of the Rings game is. Similar enough that you can just mix the cards and play. That tells me it's not the most thematic of games.

In a world that includes Sentinels of the Multiverse, I really can't understand why you'd want to represent superheroes in a card game in any other way. Deckbuilding seems unlikely to produce the same thematic feel.

Played at GenCon, and what can I say?  It's meh.  It's not terrible, there's just nothing new going on here.  If you're a comic book fan like two of the guys in my group are, maybe you'll have a soft spot for it.  They certainly were much more impressed with it than I was.

It's also alarming that this is the second time new user accounts have been opened to rate a Cryptozoic game with 10's.  This also happened with their Walking Dead game (which is complete trash) and was under investigation by BGG.

I like this without loving it.  it is a fun deck-builder that suffers from a little from a paste-on theme.  It also suffers a little bit from some fiddliness when it doesn't have to.  If they focused a little more on theme-based play I would love it

This is a pretty standard deck builder. Very similar mechanics to Star Realms, which I don't love that much. Part of my ranking is because I really enjoyed the DC Comics theme. You shouldn'tthink about theme too much though because the mechanics and theme don't always fit perfectly (i.e. Why do villain cards go in my hand? Why does Green Lantern benefit from heat vision?) Unlike other deckbuilders, there doesn't seem to be much need to cull cards from your deck.

I only have one play in right now, but after the reading the solo variant posted in the forums, I have decided to actually buy the game. I was on the fence for this one.

I think the gameplay is more polished and balanced than Legendary, but these games really are very different.

For those who might ask what other game is this most like, I would have to say this is Ascension with a DC wrapper on it.

I do wish it had come with a playmat though.

Another great game. A lot of fun. While it does not have the multiple scenarios you get in Legendary, it makes up for it in super powers, locations and equipment. You also get to play a particular hero who has an ability or advantage that influences how you play the game a bit...although you will still buy cards that represent other heroes and their super powers, equipment and locations.

Cool theme. Sadly, this game mostly plays itself.  There are no meaningful decisions to make.  Just buy the most expensive thing that you can afford.  There is no difference between villains / equipment / super powers.  Everything is simply treated equally.
Also, there is a major rich-get-richer problem. As the super villains are defeated, they bolster the decks of those players already winning.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this - it's amped-up Ascension with bosses in a lot of the same ways as Penny Arcade was amped-up Dominion with bosses. But this feels much cleaner and tighter than Penny Arcade did, and the chaos is much more in proportion to the length and dimensions of the game itself (Penny Arcade felt overwrought to me for the kind of silly game it wanted to be, plus Penny Arcade the comic property annoys me). While this isn't deeply thematic certainly, affection for the DC characters clearly went into the design. I'm far from a huge comics guy - the last time I read a comic book serial was a little Green Lantern and Superman in the early 90s - but I've always found the iconic DC heroes more appealing than Marvel, and as a very casual fan of the genre this coat of paint on the deck-buidling engine was fun.

As is typical though, the fonts are horrible - cards in the main display are unreadable because the fonts are too small for that distance.

The DC Comics Deck-Building Game is a fun little romp that is very much in the mold of Ascension. I suspect that it would have been a little more enjoyable if I were more a fan of the comics (I didn't recognize a lot of the characters, having ceased my comic book obsession about 20 years ago). The game play was smooth for the most part, with only one resource to manage rather than the several of Dominion and Ascension. I managed a tie in my first game, which suggests that the strategy itself is at least intuitive. The hardest part was simply that nearly every card had a fair bit of text describing its unique power, so I struggled at times to survey the full field and make a rational decision without slowing down the game. It is definitely a game that benefits from card familiarity. If it were an app, I would gladly play it semi-mindlessly against an AI, in the same way I ran through the Ascension app for months. Not bad.

Man this game needs to be better than this.  It's DC, and it's deckbuilding, so I should be rating it at least 8.5...  I had heard tell that the theme not fitting the mechanics of the game.  I played it, and I tried to make them fit.  I can punch and kick and this will defeat villains, and super villains, who I then add to my deck.  I am still fine with this.  When the villain turns up, in my deck, it's not THEM I am using, it's the skills I learned while defeating them.  But then WHY DO I KICK AND PUNCH Kid Flash to add him to my deck?  Or Kick and punch powers to add them to my deck....  or Punch the crap out of Batman's batmobile???  Other than this I freaking loved this game! I just need a Green Arrow Hero card and I am set!  Also on the plus side is the fact that the boys could look beyond the thematic problems and just play the game.  And even really love the game.  So any deck builder I can get the boys to play is GOOD BY ME!

I've played a bunch of Dominion. I've tried some other deck builders. I most appreciate a deck-building game that tries to add something to a game beyond what Dominion already established.

With this game (DCCTDBG?!), I don't really see anything new except the theme. The rest is straight-up deck building and pretty much strictly inferior to Dominion. There's less need to balance the different currencies of actions and "money" (or power in this game). If you've got a card, play it. There's no reason not to.

...and regarding theme, I've got equipment and villains and heroes all mish-mashed into the same deck? Doesn't quite make much sense.

The theme is very abstracted, but it really doesn't (or shouldn't) distract from what is an otherwise easy to learn, teach, setup and cleanup game.

8/13 - After a few plays I can safely say that I wouldn't be disappointed any time this was set on the table in front of me. Not the deepest brain burner out there, but darn good fun.

Very simple deckbuilding that is pretty much a super hero version of ascension. Adding characters are cool but some of them seem a bit unbalanced (weirdly enough batman and superman don't win very often)

The game appears to lack depth, and the randomness is a bit high. Granted, only two plays, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of strategy other than grab whatever decent card you can afford, and if you can't, at least screw the others over.

RATING: 5.9
The theme breaks down regularly. (Why is Aquaman using Batman's utility belt? Why is Green Lantern using Aquaman's trident? Why do villains go in your deck if you're a hero? That last one bugs me the most.) Too many cards are luck-based. The heroes are wildly unbalanced. Cyborg has a clear advantage over the Flash, for example. A player can run away with the game by defeating certain super-villains like Parallax early in the game. Not enough female heroes. Generally, not a good game, but it can be a nice change of pace. Easy to learn, easy to play. Good artwork. But Star Realms fills the same niche and does so in a much better way.

Fun game with a group of 3 or more that's easy enough to teach in 5 minutes.  Between the attacks from other players and attacks/effects of the Villains/Super-Villains, plus the excellent amount of potential combos available, it makes for an amazingly simple-yet-deep deck builder.  NOTE: One has to use a bit of imagination for the theme, but it's not as big a stretch as one might think.  Also, with more sets in my collection now, I've begun to experiment with mixing cards from certain sets in order to create thematic decks...that alone can be a lot of fun if you just want to fiddle around with the cards without playing a full game.

Unless you are super into DC comics just get Dominion instead. Its not the bad game, but the combos and card choices are a bit weak and the game can last quite a bit longer than you really want it too.

7 Herois i 12 Super-Villanos.
+ 8è heroi: Martian Manhunter
ENFUNDAT (Ref.7041 de MayDay/Homoludicus/Zacatrús)
============================
Opinió: Setup més ràpid que Dominion. Més tema, més atractiu. Més caòtic i menys estratègic que Dominion. Hi ha varis super-herois 'situacionals', és a dir, que podràs fer ús de les seves habilitats depenent de les cartes en el Line-Up en el teu torn. Altres herois són més robustos, menys situacionals.
Crec que com a joc és millor el Dominion, però aquest per tema i perquè no pots anar a pinyó fixo, enganxa més.
Pot frustrar una mica quan els rivals activen molt els seus poders d'inici i tu no. Hi ha sempre alguna partida que pot sortir una mica rana.
============================
Té vàries expansions:
- Crisis Expansion (pack1)(17€): Allarga la partida a 2+ hores (en mode coop). Requereix el joc bàsic o alguna de les expansions autojugables. Aporta nous herois (6 més), mode solitari i cooperatiu, i mode competitiu de dificultat extrema (Impossible Mode). Amb les cartes-fitxes dels 8 herois / 12 Super-Villans revisades per adaptar-se als nous modes. Les Crisis (que s'han de superar abans de vèncer al Super-Villano) es veu que són molt putes i putejen molt. Diuen que el mode cooperatiu no mata, però tot lo demés està molt bé. Altres diuen que es transforma un joc frenètic i ràpid de 30 minuts en un joc frustrant de 2h (diu que les crisis no 'desafien', només 'endarrereixen' i frustren).
- Heroes Unite (30€): expansió autojugable amb 7 nous herois i totes les cartes necessàries. Corregeix coses de l'original (fa que les Localitzacions no siguin tan bones, millora la interacció), més combos, més maneres de guanyar. Diuen que al final de la partida hi ha menys diferència de punts. CONTRA: diuen que si es mesclen, llavors es dilueixen els combos originals.
- Forever Evil (32€): expansió autojugable. Nous desafiaments i habilitats, i la possibilitat de portar els Villanos enlloc dels super-herois O_o.
- Rivals: Batman VS The Joker (17€?): Per jugar 2, confrontament 1x1. Un jugador és Batman i l'altre el Joker. Cadascún rep 3 cartes del personatge. El joc acaba quan derrotes les 3 cartes del personatge rival. Quan es derrota, p.ex. Batman1, apareix Batman2 que és encara més fort, i Batman3 encara ho serà més.
===================================

Basically an [i]Ascension[/i] clone with not a heckuva lot of actual decisions being made. You buy what you can afford, and kill the bad guys when you can. More of an activity than an actual game.

This is basically a cynical cash grab, and yet another case study in just how easily some people are blinded by theme.

Just got this for my 8-year old for Christmas.  We break it out fairly often, mainly because of the theme (although my son is way more into Legendary).  

This is a very simple deck builder, I'd say a little too simple in the end.  Unlike some of our other regularly played deck builders, your deck becomes too big.  3/4 of the way into the game, if you purchase a great card, you might not see it in your hand more than once for the rest of the game. Also, for such a large # of Weakness cards, they are almost insignificant during game-play.  

Overall, the game needs to be streamlined in some way to allow for more choices.  You draw, buy, discard over and over, without any real decisions to make other than what cards to acquire.  And even that is usually obvious.  

Having said that, it is pretty fun.  I like how many different cards there are, with the variety of heroes, villains, equipment, powers, etc.  The game flows very smoothly and never drags out.  

It's like a decent roast chicken, when you've got a hankering for a pot roast.

I didn't expect to like this as I'm not a comics reader and the only DC Comics thing I'm at all familiar with is Batman (thanks to Christopher Nolan). But I liked this quite a bit more than expected. It's basically Ascension, but cleaner and scales up to multi-player much better. Fast and fun with colourful cards. It lacks some depth and I wonder about the long-term play here, but it's a terrific filler. My kids have a blast playing it and that elevates it a point. A few minor usability issues with the cards.

RATING: 7
The word on the street was that the DC Comics Deck-Building Game was the simpler and inferior sibling to Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game (two worse game names would be hard to find, so in that sense they're definitely kin).  After having played both, though, I can say I enjoyed the simpler, yet less fiddly, DC game.  Thematically, it's very strange to play as super heroes directly benefitting by the downfall of other super heroes, but it works for better game play for me than the dreaded "semi-co-operative" alternative.  I do wonder at the DC entry's legs, as it seems fairly obvious how you want to play each hero.  But I'm sure a few expansions will fix that potential problem.

This game is better than it has any right to be.  The theme is garbage.  The idea that you are members of the Justice League pulling a Legolas/Gimli game of one-upsmanship just doesn't sit right with me.  

Theme aside, I think this game plays better than Ascension and is less swingy.  I'm also curious to pick up some of the expansions that add solo play.

like Ascention or Thunderstone or too many games lately, it is sorely lacking in any long-term strategic decisions. You draw and then buy the best stuff that happens to be there. 

Part of the cleverness of Dominion is that there are decisions that have include benefits and costs: buy several okay cards or just one great card? Take a VP card even though it is a dead weight card in your hand? Most of the imitator deckbuilding games lack these simple traits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The "card hoarding for points / power" flaw can be addressed by requiring the active player to spend the points to capture the super villain if the power total permits.

Some may argue that certain superheroes are overpowered (Wonder Woman, Superman, etc), but just like in the DC Universe, they are the most powerful. Other players just have to be smarter when playing the other characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
A waste of time.

Honestly, this should be enough of a summary, but hey, the game wasted my time, so let's waste yours. Ascension-style deckbuilding rests on somewhat-distinctive valuation between various players; DC makes this blindingly obvious and removes subtle deck synergies in favor of obvious set collection and poorly thought out variable player powers. The cards are poorly balanced; there's few skill-testing cards; again, it's basically just a waste of time.

Maybe the game's not aiming for a strategic experience? Unfortunately, it offers no meaningful player interaction and no theme, either. For people who enjoy pictures of DC superheroes only.

An awesomely fun and simple deck builder. Great to use to introduce people to the genre. The theme is great and the game is a hell of a lot of fun. Super excited to try out some of the expansions. Small nitpick, but the box is completely unable to contain sleeved cards in a comfortable way. I ended up just putting the game in a 600~ count trading card box. That works fin for me, but I'd understand if that made some people less than happy with the box. Pretty small nitpick though

This is a great deck building game.  If you are new to the hobby or to deck-building games then this is where you should start.  Fast and fun, everyone I teach this too asks to play it again when the game ends.

There are only a couple of small downsides to the game for me. First, this game makes absolutely no sense thematically. The Flash and Green Lantern are fighting Ras al Ghul for some reason and also attacking each other while fighting off villains.  After you "beat" a villain or super villain, they then join your team and fight with you.  None of it makes any kind of sense.

The only other downside is that the game has a bunch of "base game" companions instead of more traditional add on expansions.  This is only a minor annoyance as you can still pick up the other sets at a good price, it just makes it harder than necessary to combine the different sets.  This however may be a plus for some people.

In conclusion.  If you are looking to try out the deck-building genre or already like deck-building games and DC Comics, then you should get this game.

[2 plays] This game seems to end too fast, but is still fun. Much that is Dominionesque, but the main different thing is having a row of cards to buy from the deck.  This is cool, but can slow things down since at the start of your turn there are usually new options to look at.  But I like the way the superhero theme highlights useful combinations--like even if you've never played the game before and barely understand anything, it's a safe bet that if you're Batman you probably want the Batmobile, and so forth.

I utterly hate this game. It makes laughable any suggestion that any other game is athematic. This game goes beyond that and is antithematic. It sounds good at the start: Every player is a member of the Justice league and they're trying to gain power to beat supervillains. Why, then, are people stealing each other's kit? Why are people causing wounds to other players using villains. Why isn't everybody working together? Why would it even be possible, as the owner of the game explained, to "troll" the other players? Find me a single moment in a Justice League comic book where, in front of the enemy, any team member "trolled" another. Awful. So, so disappointing.

Not as involving as Thunderstone, but it's soooo much easier to set up and play, with no laborious re-boxing process when you're done.

A pretty decent Ascension clone. I was actually mistaken that this wasn't indeed that: I thought the game system was licensed from the Ascension folks but it turns out it must be different enough that they can't be sued. Really though, there is so much to this that feels like Ascension, but I think I like this one a bit more. Why? For all the simplicity of Ascension, this one is a bit more streamlined and accessible. I enjoy the Marvel artwork more than Ascension (though I don't have a problem with Ascension's art as other people do). I like the idea of global attacks. But like Ascension, the mechanics for most of the time have absolutely no connection to the source material. The DC Comics thing is just wallpaper on a well-built deck builder. This isn't a game I'd necessarily seek out, but I'd play it again.

Light deckbuilder. Not as thematic as Marvel Legendary. Also, seems to be far more luck dependent than other deckbuilders. 

In most deckbuilders I feel that my strategy is the most important factor involved in winning. In this game I feel that luck of the draw, mainly in what cards are available when it's my turn, is the biggest factor.

Still, fun to play, and usually pretty quick. The latter factor may keep it in play longer than it would otherwise.

Most like Ascention - this is a light weight deck builder with nothing new but is fun regardless - hey, it has Super Heroes and Villians! DC adds a light "attack" mechanic to the otherwise Ascention (lite) game play. 

Card art is good, icongraphy only average - they should have made Power (the game's only currency) more distinctive - and card thickness is a little on the skinny side although the cards appear Ok.

Fun but very lite on game play.

You are a DC superhero in this very simple and below-average deck building game with zero creativity. It uses an ever-changing row of cards, like "Ascension", bringing a kind of randomness that I dislike. You have a single currency, power, and defeat a supervillain in the same way that you buy heroes, villains (!), superpowers, equipment and locations to your deck. To make it worse, things are not properly balanced and there is a serious runaway leader problem.

At least it is relatively quick, but its only appeal is the theme, which probably has the worst implementation I have ever seen. There is no restriction on what you can buy, although some cards have a bit more synergy with one superhero or another, like Superman benefiting from superpowers and Batman from equipment. When I played, however, I got the Batcave, the Batmobile, Penguin and the Joker, which would have been nice if I were Batman, but I was Green Lantern. And I had X-ray vision! The game is not too bad, actually, but everything - gameplay, theme application and even the title - is just incredibly lazy and it shows.

Even though there is not much to this game, it is still really fun to play.  You can get randomly screwed or rewarded during this game, but after playing a lot of games it moves pretty fast, so much like catan, if you have a bad game, it doesn't drag on for even an hour.  It is a good entry point for beginners, and can supply hours of fun if one fancies this game.

This replaced Ascension as my favorite light deckbuilder and (fairly or unfairly) sees the table more than Sentinels of the Multiverse and Legendary combined. 

Not that comparing this to Marvel Legendary is 100% fair, but but if I only have room for either this or Legendary, I would choose DC Comics every time for overall gaming satisfaction.

The artwork is excellent, the gameplay is direct and the polar opposite of fiddly (surpassing Legendary in setup, gameplay, and replays); it moves fast and does the things that a quick, lighter, engine-building deckbuilder should do. For our group Legendary's theme gets bogged down/starved by how fiddly and abstract gameplay is. And there's no sense of a real engine being built before the game abruptly ends.  

DC's game is faster and more obviously trying to engine build to work up the "ladder" in defeating the supervillain cards. Again, it works different muscles than Legendary, but in better ways for my tastes.

The card effects themselves are intuitive and thematic to the heroes/villains/powers they describe. Playing with fans of DC comics and superhero fans in general is an added bonus, but it doesn't alienate anyone who's only casual. There's game there regardless.

This is one of my wife's favorite games, and it certainly plays quickly and smoothly. I'm not a huge fan of deckbuilders overall, but I regard this as a quality implementation of the single-resource, Ascension-style model.

After playing several other versions of the game, this one is still my favorite.

This is fun but feels very light. It's probably an excellent introductory deck builder and good for the younger crowd. I am hoping there is an expansion that adds a bit more depth to it.

This is a simple deck building game themed around the D.C. comics universe.  It is more basic than Legendary and is probably a better fit for younger players.  This game was OK but not something I would generally seek out to play.

RATING: 6.5
Played a complete game (with 1/2 the bosses) at PAX Demo Booth.  I got second place of four.  

What I Liked: Different setup than the normal deckbuilder, since a more limited (Ticket to ride style) 5 random cards are available to purchase at any time.  This can be good, or can be useless, so a few basic cards, plus the bosses themselves, can be purchased at any time.

This is cool, since it means that your choice of initial superhero and varying special powers means that each player will gravitate towards different cards, so multiple valid strategies will be present.

That said, this must affect replay-ability, since each game uses the same (large) set of random cards.  You don't have the acutely different strategy discovery you get with the selection of only 10 action cards in any given game like for Dominion or similar.

Good to see variety in the genre, but not something I will seek out.

We must have played this close to 30 times now, and the first 15 came within the first few months of ownership.

Initially, it hit the table because it was easy to learn, and we could finish it quite quickly. It's definitely a weeknight game*.

However, after a few plays -- despite my daughter's insistence -- my wife and I were sick of it. I don't want to say it was the theme or lack of difficulty or anything specific, we just wanted something different. 

Jump forward a few months and we had managed to snag the first Crisis expansion as well as the Watchmen box for a great price. Well, we had a blast, partly due to the fresh cards, and mostly due to the increased difficulty. These seemingly simple additions re-ignited our desire to play.

For a time.

Again, it's not the theme (or lack thereof), or a specific thing. It's just that we own better deck-builders now, or at least ones that are more fun for us, and... well, better non-deck-builders as well.

To put it differently, DC Comics Deck-Building Game is a nice way to discover deck-building, and I'd say we more than got our money's worth, but I no longer wish to play.


*For me, a weeknight game is an accessible or family game around 60 minutes, including set-up and tear-down. It's to be played after supper and before we put my daughter to bed.

RATING: 7
A bog-standard deck building game which evinces as much creativity in its design as it does its name: not a bit. I'd say that it fails miserably in evoking the DC superhero license, but it's clear that it wasn't really a consideration. It's simply Ascension with one form of currency and five suits, with a Legion of Super Heroes theme lightly pasted on.

And yet... I kinda dig it. Once I got past my disappointment in what the game ain't, I have to admit that I like what it is. You can dump it out of the box and start playing in seconds, there are some interesting combinations of cards available, and my love of DC comics pulls me in, even if it's just pictures of my favorite heroes and villains.

There's no doubt that Marvel's Legendary is the superior deck-building superhero game (Sentinels of the Multiverse is the best superhero game, period) but there's room on my shelf for Deck-Building Game.

I've played this more times than I can count, and it's still a perennial favorite with me and my group. We played an epic game with every expansion right after Teen Titans came out, and it was a 12-hour experience that I'll not soon forget. There are periods where I find this game tiresome, but I won't ever get rid of my copy (+ all expansions), and I'm unlikely to argue much when my game group chooses DCDB to play.

One of my wife's favorite games, which is funny because when I bought it, I thought she'd hate it.  I like it quite a bit.  Yes, the theme is completely pasted on.  Yes, some character powers seem muuuuuch better than others.  But we have fun playing it and can generally overlook that stuff.  It was the first deckbuilder we'd really ever played and I think it was a good introduction to the basic mechanics of the genre.

I'm a DC fan. I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't, no matter how hard I tried. It just lacks any sense of theme. Other than the artwork on the cards it didn't feel DC at all.

A simpler deck builder than Legendary which has pluses and minuses in comparison.  The game play is much more redundant than Legendary, but the lack of a coop goal seems to make more sense.

Pulls some good parts from Ascension.  Some card concepts from Dominion.  Adds a few new twists with each player being a superhero and a stack of Boss Villains to defeat. So, not truly unique, but the theme is a plus and works well with the mechanics incorporated.

Fast, fun, with many paths to victory (if you want to think about it when playing).  People in my gaming world keep asking to play, even my wife.  Really lots of fun.  SuperHero and Supervillian character cards seem like they could use a little balancing.  We got around that problem by bidding points for the character you want to play.  High bidder gets the character.  Then just subtract the points you bid from your final total.  It's more fun this way and it balances the characters.  A win-win.

I really enjoy this game, moreso than Marvel Legendary.  That's saying something as these are both deck builders but I am much more of a Marvel fan than of DC comics. It's a very easy game to learn and play, almost too simple really but what I really enjoy are the different roles of the heroes which is what Legendary is lacking.  It's a lot of fun to play a specific hero because you need to play to that heroes strengths in order to win.

I really do enjoy this game.  Thematically, some of the things don't make sense, for example, how can Batman use Superman's heat vision?  To me, that doesn't really matter.  It isn't a very deep game, especially compared to other deck builders, but it can definitely be full of strategy.  I have no problem bringing this game out for newer and/or non-gamers, and I always hear the same things: first, "I prefer the Marvel universe, but I can get into this," then, "wow, this is a cool game!"

Now, I enjoy the Marvel Legendary game - it makes more thematic sense, it has some interesting mechanics, and it is co-op.  unfortunately, the setup takes an eon, and the cleanup is three times as long.  Not to mention how punishing the game can be with some of the new masterminds.  We spend more time in setup/cleanup than actual game time, and the newer gamers are put off by how difficult it is.

This is not a "bash Legendary" review, I like the game.  I only bring it up to compare how this simpler card game can be more enjoyable more often than the heavy-hitters.  Best deck builder ever?  No - but I will never turn down this game.

Also, Aquaman is a beast in this game, and I love being able to say, "you got punked by Aquaman, how does that make you feel?"

I can almost hear the meeting: "...so we should have a deck-building game, too!"  They didn't even bother to give it a name.  It just has the DC Comics logo and "Deck-Building Game."  Nothing here that hasn't been done better somewhere else.  Okay, so if you insist on playing it because, yo, whatever superhero is cool, then I'll go along.  It's not bad, particularly.  But I want something more than, "Ooh, Batman."

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2015)

As I have heard that DC Comics Deck-Building Game was way worse than Legendary and I absolutely hate Legendary, I was expecting very little from it, however I was pleasantly surprised to find a simple, but enjoyable deck building game.

First of all, the game features a random market offering so I don’t think it will go up in my personal ratings. I generally dislike deck building games in which the card offering is random because it is very unfair and it is pure luck if a player manages to get a card while the other player doesn’t. Having saying that, this is the game in which the variable card offering bothers me the least. The reason is that in DC Comics Deck-Building Game there is only one currency to manage (power), so all the cards (in one way or other) help you in this regard and the luck of the draw is minimized so I feel the player who played the best will win most of the time.

Besides the variable market offering, this game is very reminiscent of Penny Arcade. Both games have especial characters that gives you additional powers during the game and both games have bosses to defeat, I like that. Also the game can be very quick to finish and it is very welcome feature.

The art is very good, but I don’t feel the theme when I play it, on the other hand I’m not bothered when Batman uses the Fortress of Solitude, but I know some friends are bothered by this. 

As with most deck building games, I feel the game is best with two players, with more the playtime and the downtime begin to creep up for such a simple game. However there are some cards that are clearly intended for more than two players, perhaps I will play it with three to see how it goes. 
 
Bottom line, DC Comics Deck-Building Game is a fun game, way better than I was expecting. I wouldn’t say no to a play of it. I wish it will come out for iOS. Perhaps I will buy it and now I regret I sold a bunch of hard to get promo cards. The lesson, I won’t sell games I haven´t played yet.

A comic fan forever. Hesitantly bought it. Actually a pretty fun light weight game. If you are a fan of Dominion, Acesion, Legendary or similar games, you can learn and play this game with absolutely no difficulties. Fonts for the Power on the cards could of been bigger. Cards feel good, lots of replay. Without a doubt this game needs much more cards of all types, Super Villians especially. Heroes will be nice, and more cards in the main deck. Has potential for tons of expansions. Bring on the expansions to enlarge our choices in play.

Card drafting based on points you get from the cards you play. It's like Dominion with DC super-heroes except that the collection of super-villains triggers the end of the game. Some combinations are powerful than others… but those are the ones tied directly to the New 52 Justice League.

BIG PLUS: appeals to DC Comics fans
PLUS: easy to learn, keeps your attention, more enjoyable than base Dominion
MINUS: not really much you can do with the cards – it's draft for points that drives the game forward

Fast fun.  I really enjoy this.  Having played both this and the LOTR version over 10 times each now, DC is better.  The superheroes individual powers provides much more strategic thinking than the single starting card in LOTR.  There are probably more combos in LOTR but there are still some in DC as well.  The ambush cards in LOTR are really random though - I don't like that - so you seem to spend a lot more time having 'nothing' turns.

Deckbuiling lite. I think your enjoyment of the game will be directly proportional to your enjoyment of the theme. So much so that if you are irrationally in love with DC comics, you might not be able to accept the inevitable conflicts relative to the characters, abilities, equipment, etc. But if you're just a moderate fan of the DCU, and don't mind the thought of Aquaman making use of Batman's gadgets, then there's a simple, engaging game waiting for you here.

Realitively basic deck-building game.  Pretty simple to introduce new players to it.

People that care about comics will probably really enjoy this game. To me this is basically an Ascension variant. I have a passing familiarity with the characters, but the theme is not a draw to me. There are some pretty crazy powers, but it seems more difficult to get your deck to behave a certain way than in Ascension or Dominion. So it's a nice little game, but really no reason to ever play this over Dominion.

I like how you're actually controlling one hero to some effect, as compared to Marvel's Legendary, and a heck of a lot easier to set-up. Still weird to play villain cards though. I really want to see a game where you really feel like you're in control of a super hero.

Fast and fun beer & pretzels deck building game. Light on strategy but you can pull off cool combos and many games come down to a few points separating the winner from the rest of the players which adds to the "just one more game!" factor. Sentinels of the Multiverse is still the number one super heroes game on our block but the DC DBG is better than Legendary which just seems to stay permanently in the cupboard.

RATING: 7
My initial ranking for this game was 9 but after about 30 games played, I'm down grading it to 7.

The game is beautiful and has great mechanics, it runs smoothly and provides lots of possible combos.

Though, most of the time players rush for the super-villain stack and a quick victory.
The game ends so quickly then that you don't have time to build your deck and enjoy your combo ideas.

When this doesn't happen the game reveals it's other limit : when a player starts building up power (sometimes as soon as his second turn) there's no way you can interfere.
Not only, he can't be slowed down but chances are he will get stronger every turn and play longer turns (in which case you'll have to wait longer to play a shorter turn)

Either way, after so many games played it gets frustrating : don't have time to build and use combos or get crushed by a luckier player (or crush another frustrated player).

Christmas 2012. Gift to Kosit from James and Meagan!

I'm so glad to have this game. The cards are really thematic. The text and powers very often reflect the characters or equipment they represent. So for a DC comic fan, it's really neat to imagine things happening. My wife isn't a fan of comics, but enjoyed the mechanics just fine. Of course, I get a higher level of enjoyment out of it. Thumbs up!

I like the different card types and events that happen to everyone when certain villains come out.  Cool and thematic.  ...But still a deck builder.

Batman! Superman! Wonder Woman! Aquaman! The Flash! Green Lantern! Cyborg! The Justice League of America is ready for action – are you? Fight the never-ending battle for truth, justice, and peace in the DC Comics Deck-Building Game!

To start the game, each player chooses one of the seven over-sized hero cards, each of which has a special power, and starts with a deck of ten cards. Each turn, a player starts with a hand of five cards and can acquire or conquer the five types of cards in the game: heroes, villains and super-villains, equipment, super powers, and locations. To defeat villains, you'll need to have power – but when a super-villain is defeated, a new one comes into play, attacking all the heroes while doing so. Make sure you've acquired defenses – like superspeed or bulletproof powers, or The Batsuit equipment – to protect yourself from harm.

RATING: 5
The game works, but it's far from being fun. It's a very primitive deck building game that would have made sense to be released about at least the same time than dominion. But now, I think it is way too late.

There is only 1 resources, you use power to defeat stuff and buy stuff which are in fact the same thing. Which is surprising.

Now the thematic aspect is screwed up. Why I can't buy cards strictly related to my character? I buy cards from all character which makes my character hybrid. But the worst part is that you put villains in your deck too. Very weird. The theme of the game makes no sense at all.

Another thing is that having a random selection of face up cards to buy is annoying to read and select which card you need. But compared to "Legendary" game, it is less an issue in this game since the game is simpler and there is less text on the cards.

The game play is pretty dull, you just buy cards each turn which simply constantly inflate your deck and makes you less efficient. So you have little control over your deck and have little possibilities to thin it.

The good side, is that it plays fast and it's easy to grasp but it strongly lack of depth.

RATING: 7
I enjoy deck-builder games like the whole Ascension series, Legendary, A Few Acres of Snow (not really Dominion though).  

The only complaint that I have with DC is that the main Super Heroes played by each person is NOT fairly balanced.  I tend to believe that Green Lantern and Aquaman are significantly more advantageous than the rest of the Super Heroes.  They need to make them all more balanced in some way.

Update (Apr.2013):   After an initial session of 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship Deck-Building Game', I think I prefer that over DC Comics.  It's essentially the same system but they've improved how the Arch-Enemies (Super Villians) arise by escalating them, from low to high.  An excellent tweak!

It's Ascension with the DC license.  Pretty much all the originality and uniqueness from this game can be seen from it's title.  DC Deckbuilding game.  Really?  They didn't even try to give it a real name.  The mechanics aren't anything new.  Like I said, it's Ascension but with DC characters and it plays exactly so.  The theme is so weak.  It barely makes any sense.  I hate it.  The only saving grace is the great artwork.  Legendary > DC Deck-building Game.

Bad Dominion clone (or clone of a clone, if you prefer to compare it to Ascension).

I'm not a huge comic-book fan, I found I enjoyed this game all the same. It's incredibly simple, which is both a strength and a weakness. The game features only one resource. This makes the game extremely easy to learn. On the other hand, there's not much depth to the strategy aspect of the game. It's really great if you just want a fast paced competitive game to kill time, but I prefer Ascension or even Legendary if I'm looking for something with a little more depth. That being said, the artwork is absolutely gorgeous and it's gotten me a little more interested in the DC Universe.

Up front... I'm not employed by DC Comics, CZE, Board Game Geek... I'm a band director at a local college and I work at a comic/game store. In other words... I'm just a regular gaming Joe. I have played thousands of games, including every deck-building game released to date. I have now played this game six times with two and three players. I have enjoyed it immensely. I prefer to consider games for what they are and not really compare to other games (other than to explain what its like to someone). My wife has actually ASKED to play this game!

What do I like about this game?
*It is very easy to learn, teach, set up, and put away.
*The rulebook is well-written. It has good examples and it flows in a sensible manner.
*Each of the Super-Villain's "First Appearance" effects provide a neat twist. They make players sometimes think twice about defeating one and can have very interesting effects on game play.
*The ability to "attack" other players with Villain (and Super-Villain) cards is a very welcome mechanic. Being able to do bad things to my opponents is always a plus for me.
*Being able to toss "Vulnerability" and "Weakness" cards into your opponents deck, instead of just not-so-useful starter cards (like "Punch"), is a nice touch.﻿
*The defense ability that certain cards have keeps you from always having players like me do the aforementioned "bad things" to you. All of the "defense" cards in this base set also have additional abilities, so they aren't JUST for "avoiding" attacks. Multi-functioning cards are always great in my book!
*The cards are well-themed for each of the characters, items, abilities, and places.
*The individual Super-Hero player identity cards provide a bit of a different experience each time you play and make you think a little... not just take the same strategy each and every time you play.
*The game scales well with more than two players. I don't feel like you lose anything based on the number of players involved.
*The built-in variant of "On Patrol" is very neat and fun. It adds a little danger to purchasing cards... not much... but enough to make you think twice about what you acquire and what cards you leave in your hand.﻿

What things am I on the fence about in this game?
*The single "currency" type of "Power" allows you to keep your deck diverse, BUT it also takes away some the strategic choices you must  make in games with multiple types of currency.
*The generic card back design will allow Cryptozoic Entertainment the option to expand on the game with intellectual properties that aren't necessarily DC Comics'. I can't say the look is all that appealing though.﻿

What do I NOT like about this game?
*I wish a board or a mat had been included. I know it isn't necessary... but I don't like that they didn't include one. The roll up mat Cryptozoic Entertainment put in their "The Walking Dead Board Game" (base on the TV show) is ingenious! I truly wish they had done one for this game.
*There are a few cards that are difficult to compete against: "Man of Steel" and "Princess Diana of Themiscyra". While I can't say they are broken... I think they might be close. I have had well over 50 power on a turn with a well-timed MoS. Getting either of these late-game isn't so bad. Getting them within the fist few rounds can be devastating to your opponents, though. I haven't lost a game with MoS early. (-0.5 point)
*Aquaman is a little rough to compete against, too. The other player card abilities are good and seemingly balanced... his ability to stack cards on your deck is... well... anytime you can choose what your next hand is can be brutally awesome right? (-0.5 point)﻿
*While I get the effect they were trying to achieve with the "Vulnerability" cards... surely something else besides a dead card could have been created. Perhaps they could have included a card that lets you remove another card from your deck. (-0.25 point)﻿
*Speaking of which... some way to remove your starting cards from your deck without relying on lucking into specific cards from the main deck would have been nice.﻿ A basic game mechanic could have been added that would allow you to forfeit a turn to destroy a card. (-0.25 point)﻿

Anyway... hopefully this provides a little insight for you. I do suggest you purchase and play this game. It is a worth-while investment in my opinion... and its just plain fun. :)

Edit: These days I would rate this game a 6.5-7.0. I still use it as an introduction to deck-building games almost exclusively. I DO really like what some of the expansions has added, too. Just thought I'd follow up on this review I wrote while I was thinking about it.

Just got this today and was able to get in a game against my 11 yr old nephew. I was Batman and he was Flash, many have said this game lacks theme, but I completely disagree. Most of the cards are very well thought out, a few of my favorites were Clay Face, Two Face and X-Ray Vision, the abilities on these cards fit their themes perfectly and these are only a few of the many. While I"ll agree I didn't feel like I was Batman I did feel like I was using his ability to build a more powerful deck. I like the idea of the weakness cards clogging up your deck, I may even add a house rule that the are -1 power when in your hand to really make them fit their theme. Overall I really like this DBG, the art work is amazing and the game play is simple yet immersive.

Some parts of this game make it feel anti thematic, like seeing Wonder Woman beating the Joker with a Heat Sight.

Nevertheless, I found this game quite fun. It's not the garbage people are yelling here and there. The mechanisms work well and the game, as a whole, provides a lot of entertainment.

The setup is very fast, which is a huge plus.

I will play it again and anytime.

A lighter version of Ascension: Chronicles of the Godslayer, but with a superhero theme.  Better theme than dominion, but more cards to memorise as everything is shuffled into the draw pile.  

Occasionally fun to play, would play again and probably would get more use out of it than Dominion at this point (at least for a few plays).

Only downside is that games can drag a bit, even when only playing 8 villains.  A decent game, and happy to play on occasion, but not continually.  Not one for my collection as I prefer Ascension.  However, this theme would be much more suitable for children than Ascension. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Played a full game at Gen Con 2012. 

Basically, you play a DC hero with a specific power which will dictate your selection of new card to purchase each round. 

Because of that, there is generally only one best card to buy, so the game is essentially auto-play. Very boring. 

The game is far too swingy.  If the cards your hero needs don't come out, you lose. 

To be fair, my opinion is based on only one play, and I would be willing to try this one again, but my first impression was quite negative.

I have owned this and Legendary and this is the one I kept. It's a simple concept that is easy to teach. A big difference between the two is that you get the sense of playing your chosen hero rather than the universe itself. I see it playing out as a neat series of episodes leading up to each supervillain acquired/defeated. Plus the art nod goes to this game for having simply more of it.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]21-Jan-2017[/u]:  This is a fairly straightforward deckbuilder set in the DC Comics universe.  It's a lighter game in the genre, but one not without its merits.  The game only has one "currency" (Power), so that keeps the complexity down.  The challenge, like all deckbuilders I've played, is to build a deck that works cohesively and efficiently.  That is certainly present in this game.

However, it does feel like a slow build so far, in my experience.  There doesn't seem to be a high availability of cards that allow you to cull your deck.  That means the game will go a little longer than I'd like, but not to the point of overstaying its welcome.  And once it does gel, it's certainly enjoyable making those card combos to defeat the Super Villains.

Just as with Marvel Comics and the Legendary game, I don't have a strong knowledge of the DC Comics universe, but I definitely enjoy the theme here.  And moreso than with Legendary, I feel the artwork on the cards is an even a bigger positive.  I really enjoy just looking at most of the cards and am even tempted to pick up a couple issues of DC Comics because of it.

I'm exclusively using a solo variant of my own design, [thread=1708450][/thread], and I think it works quite well.  It's very similar to the solo variants for Ascension and Star Realms.  My variant gives the player an opponent to compete against and whose actions are determined by a card type in play in the Line Up.  It plays quickly and has a minimal number of card errata.  But, just like the Nemesis Beast in Star Realms, there can be some swings of difficulty.  Hopefully, it's a fair challenge more often than not, though.

Before I wrap this up, a quick word on the [thing=167763]Teen Titans[/thing] card set (yes, I have a problem).  I've only played this set once at the time of this post, but I like it a lot.  I know nothing of the Teen Titans backstory...didn't know it existed until I bought the base game.  Anyway, this set has an emphasis toward Ongoing Effects (cards that remain in play until used).  This adds a nice (albeit small) step up in complexity and cardplay as compared to the base game.  I look forward to exploring this set more in the coming months.

So, overall, I like DC Deckbuilder.  It's a light game, for sure, but it's enjoyable.  There is enough going on in the cardplay and deckbuilding to keep me interested when I don't want the hard-hitting challenge of games such as Shadowrun: Crossfire.  My hope was for DC Deckbuilder to replace Ascension in my collection as the theme and art are much more appealing to me in DC, and this is a winner in that sense.  It's of a similar style and complexity as that game, so it's a good swap in my collection.  With my Nemesis solo variant, I've found fun and challenge in a solid super hero deckbuilder.

Probably the game with the most unoriginal name in the world. Most of the mechanics are unoriginal too, as it’s 80% Ascension. Still, the theme is very fitting and provides very rich illustrations, and the additions to the gameplay are all great and elevate the game to a higher level than its predecessors. The end result is a very fun game that, when played fast, is addictive and variant and rewarding, with a lot of tactical decisions and some strategy involved. One of the best deck building games I’ve played.

This game took everything I liked about Ascension and kicked it up to another level. The game plays fast and has a ton of player interaction.

The game never stalls out or grinds to a slow pace thanks to the one type of currency. You always have something you can buy. 

The combos in the game are also fun and are easy to find, so new players will have a chance there first game. 

The theme is also great in this game. A lot of the cards interact the way you think they would based on what hero/villain is on the card. 

I really enjoy this game and its quick setup and play time will make sure it hits the table often. 

I can't wait for expansions.

I know I shouldn't like this game. It's not particularly original or deep. However, my daughter and I love playing it (and the various other DC DBG standalone sets) simply because it's pure fun. We like stringing together silly combos and watching our decks get more and more powerful. It's like a board game version of a sugary snack.

Also, as a longtime DC fan, I enjoy all the different artwork. The thematic integration actually works better for me than most people. I like to imagine my decks with weird combinations of powers and heroes/villains as whacky alternate universe Grant Morrison stories or something. Isn't that what the DCU is all about? :)

Very basic deck building with potential. Reminds me a lot of Ascension (bit of a point salad too). Some of the variants inject some potential depth but the base game drags. Its fun for 45 minutes but then you look at the villains deck and think damn ! Another 2 hours grinding to try and get a lucky draw out of my bloated deck (Only a handful of culling cards in the base set so be careful what you buy). I'm sticking with this one because it's by no means bad. With a variant here and an add-on there this could seriously improve. Alas, tries several variants to spice the game up and they couldn't save it. If you are deciding between this, Legendary marvel or Sentinels of the multiverse my advice is Legendary. Huge array of characters, enemies and plots with an elegant system. Dc is severely lacking in gameplay. Sentinels is the definition of "fiddly" gaming with a zillion key words which quickly became a chore.

RATING: 8
Granted the theme could have been better approached by making it a team game, but oddly all the supposed issues that delayed me from purchasing, did not effect me or my other comic buddies at all. I had no problem with this not being a team game, playing villians or being Aquaman using the Lasso of Truth.

It felt more like I was an outsider (reporter?) watching this great battle unfold with my focus more on a particular hero. I never felt like I was Superman using the Batmobile. I was more like AWESOME! here comes the Batmobile!!!which may not be what some people wanted, but was still pretty cool. 9 out of ten cards made as much sense as they could theme wise too. 

Also, because of that outsider feeling, playing villian cards never felt like I was a hero attacking my friends. It was just Scarecrow coming out somewhere in the storyline of whom my hero was not involved in his shenanigans, but somehow used it to my benefit. 

Honestly though, I never really thought that much about it, the game was a just lot of fun.  
More fun than Dominion and would rather play this any day of the week over it. Is a bit faster and less complicated than Marvel Legendary which makes it fit it's own niche in our house in which both games will be played harmoniously.

RATING: 6.5
Only one play in a pick-up game at an open games session. This game was explained to me by the owner in one short sentence:

"It's Dominion*."

And it totally is, once you get beyond the almost contra-thematic possibilities of Aqua Man nicking Batman's utility belt and cape, the Flash setting up shop in the Fortress of Solitude & etc.

Anyway, the game plays pretty much like Dominion but with DC comics art and, to a certain extent, themes.

If you like DC Comics and enjoy shuffling this could be the game for you.

Not one I'll purchase but I would play again.

* Informed sources have later advised me this is more like Ascention (which I haven't played).

規則:0.6
規則好敎好上手，沒有太複雜的變化，算是中規中矩之作。

設置:1.0
domi類的遊戲，最大的缺點就是設置有點花時間，收納整理分牌也是事後可怕的夢靨，但本遊戲完全打破domi的罩門，可以很快速擺好陣仗就開打。雖然皇輿爭霸及雷霆之石都比ＤＣ正義聯盟好玩，但光擺設就讓沒時間的我心先涼了一半。想要一過牌庫建構遊戲的癮，這款真是好選擇。

路線:0.3
本遊戲很難有不同流派的打法，中央牌列永遠都是隨機五張，你很難特意去完成特定的連續技，遊戲設定本身的變化性也不足夠，可能需要無限量擴充來增加遊戲打法的多元性。

互動:0.4
本遊戲玩家間的互動不高，只是建立自己的牌庫來擊敗超級反派來收集分數。玩家互動除了互搶超級反派外，剩下就是利用一些小反派來打擊自己人?(拉攏壞人打擊正義夥伴，這...這...真的是有夠黑暗)，其實互動並不直接。

亮點:0.2
無數美慢擴充，趕搭電影魅力風潮，遊戲機制雷同，可說沒啥亮點、創新。大概好擺設，可以輕鬆打一局。

除了美漫的加持外，本遊戲可有可無，端看個人喜愛。我是蠻愛的啦!

總分:6.1

講評：
       本遊戲在一些流程及卡牌設計上，略有些不合理的地方，像是前述的小反派，完完全全成為玩家鬥爭其他玩家的工具人，無法給於超級反派助力，既然是反派當然要發揮反派的角色能力。只是反派人物在中央牌列中，卻無法給玩家造成打擊，感覺有點怪。要是我會設計，當你本回要打敗超級反派前，若場中央有反派卡牌存在的話，需要先收拾一位中央牌列的小反派，才能再用剩餘的力量攻擊超級反派。這樣設計才能凸顯小反派存在感。
      此外，功能牌的應用很單調，像是反派、超能力、裝備、英雄，感覺只是換名稱而已，其實功能都差不多，並沒有特別不一樣的玩法。(大概LCG玩太多的後遺症)。頂多是地點牌，可以常駐場上發揮效果，其他種類的牌使用上都一樣，變化不大。這些牌組的應用其實可以好好思考一下，就可以增加本遊戲玩法多樣性。有點可惜這樣的好題材。

RATING: 5
It's is kinda fun, but hampered by being very simple. Any attempt at analyzing why any player wins or loses concludes that the player with the greater situational potential always wins- which points towards the game being based on luck. I have now played ~25 games and have no clue as to why my brother always wins beyond generally having higher situational opportunities. I finally won a game and I didn't play any differently and I had no idea why I won that round and lost all the others beyond, finally, receiving better cards to pick from (on average).

For people who played Yu-Gi-Oh/Magic this is a quick jump in for a deck building game, but considering how much it seems to be based on luck if each player consistently makes the most beneficial move, it feels limited at best.

The game also feels imbalanced in many ways, especially for 2-3 player games. Certain strong cards cost too little, and certain weaker high cost cards cost too much. The best exmaple of this are the cards such as "The Green Arrow" and "Utility Belt"- the cost/point ratio of these cards is 1:1 in a 2-3 player game, whereas most cards are worth anywhere from 1:2 to 1:4 (for non-Super Villains), making them trump cards. Then there are the Suicide Squad cards, which I've seen throw a game to a player who was barely able to play each round. Final score without Suicide Squads: player A=65 pts; B=55 pts; C=31 pts. Final Score with C having all 6 Suicide Squads: C=67 pts; player A=65 pts; B=55 pts.

Then there are the actual super heros, which feel totally incomparable to each other. The best example is comparing Cyborg against Aquaman: Aquaman is worthless after the first 10 rounds of the game, while Cyborg only becomes more powerful as you earn more cards.

Lastly, there is no real movement towards killing as many Super Villains as possible, as quickly as possible- no urgency whatsoever. If you can instead lay as many weaknesses on your opponents/buff yourself as much as possible, you can still win at a trot if you kill 3/11 of the Super Villains.

Overall frustrating due to a being a game of chance/unequal opportunity, imbalanced cost to point and benefit ratios, no urgency/desire to defeat Super Villains and therefore push the theme as hard as possible, and unequal starting options due to imbalanced Super Hero powers at the beginning.

RATING: 10
Very simple game play, quick to set up, plays fast too, not very thematic, but at least you get to play as your favourite DC heroes.  Great artwork, easier to play with non-gamers, fills a gap as a lighter game to play at the end of a game night, or at lunchtime.  £20 = very worthy investment.

UPDATE: 16/05/14

I need to say a little more about this game, as I was perhaps a little too harsh on it last time, or just not positive enough.  Alongside Star Wars, my boy is currently Batman-mental too, and when he saw the box for this he wanted in.  So we started playing a very basic version with no hero abilities, mostly just adding up our power each turn and going after one super villain each game…  And it has been absolutely brilliant!  He’s learning his maths and we’re getting to spend even more quality time with him away from the TV and watch him get terribly excited when, for example, Blue Beatle turns up, who is one of his favourite guest characters from the rather brilliant Batman: The Brave and the Bold.  Or listen to him pronouncing vulnerability (vunabeeyatee).  I’d hoped he might get interested in games through something like HeroQuest and am face palming about how simple it was to grab his attention and help with his numbers, and also grow his already relatively encyclopaedic knowledge of the DC universe through this game, which has really suddenly revealed its true, great potential.  Expansion sets, Mr Hyra?  Oh, go on then…

RATING: 5
It's basically a Dominion clone, except you have less control as you can't plan what you can buy before your turn! Cards changed too frequently, and with so many different cards you feel like the cards are guiding you rather than you having control of your deck. Game play is too chaotic.

I like deck builder in general and it is a system that is worth exploring, but my interest quickly dimnishes after I have fun exploring and assessing the cards. There are many superior deckbuilders out there.

A straightforward game where, other than core gameplay concepts, the rules are right there on the cards.  There's a great comicbook feel to the game, and it's not hard to get into the theme.

A deck building game whereby your currency is punches and kicks dealt out by DC comic heroes. Essentially a re-skin of Dominion.

A really light deck-builder.  The theme doesn't really make a lot of sense (why are the heroes competing, using one another's equipment, and enlisting villains?), and it simply takes too long to play for what is offered.

I'd suggest Star Realms instead.  Same lightness, the theme makes a little more sense (the player is trying to carve their own star realm so basically convincing the factions to turn on each other and join you), and it plays much quicker.

Mechanically Legendary is more sound. I give this game a 7 mechanically. Thematically I love DC so theme 9-10. Marvel less so. I really like injustice comics as well so villains in player decks doesn't bother me. There are many reasons villains might team up with heroes. I am motivated to get Rick and Morty and forever evil+rogues as well. Confrontations+rivals looks cool too. 

Mixed with watchmen, crisis 1, and birds of prey.

Really cool to see all the DC characters but sadly the theme doesn't really make sense. If you can get past the fact that you're Superman and you have the Batmobile, you'll have a great time.

Quem gosta de heróis provavelmente vai curtir o DC Deckbuilding. Os principais heróis da editora estão lá, e cada um tem um efeito durante todo o jogo.

O objetivo é fazer pontos - cada carta vale algo - e o jeito mais rápido de obter isso é derrotando super-vilões. Simples e divertido, bom para atrair novatos no hobby.

This is the first deck-builder I ever played.  I thought it was a perfect introduction to the deck builder world.  Although the theme is admittedly absent, if not downright confusing (why did Aquaman just attack me with Scarecrow?), it plays really smoothly.

Played one game with 6 year old son today. Felt too random in how one gets VPs to win. Although I tried my best to cull my deck, my son, who absolutely did no culling, managed to kill more super-villains than me and got more points. The addition of the extra power of the superhero did more to complicate the game than enhance it. Much prefer the simplicity and engine building aspect of Dominion.

I'm sorry but it's inevitable; I have to bring up the rivalry with Marvel. I have played Legendary, the competing deck-building game, and thought it was the epitome of the genre: complex but fun "Villain" decks, thrilling semi-cooperative gameplay, and, best of all, thematic decks for the heroes (Daredevil had "blind" draws for players, Wolverine "healed" unhelpful hands and made your deck more efficient, Deadpool was random and had his own crazy logic to gaining Recruit and Attack points). While DC may not have the fancy mechanics in the gameplay, it is a lot of fun to play. And maybe its simplicity is what I enjoy the most. While Legendary may have its specific scenarios, they all were kinda the same thing: get enough Attack points to kill the Villain five times. And that's essentially what you have for the DC Deck-building game, too. Sure, Marvel may have a greater connection with their theme and heroes, but DC holds its own here. The game play for Legendary is more intricate and specific but the game also takes a long time to set up, for generally the same amount of fun you can get out of a deck-building game. The best part of the DC game is that any super-villain you defeat becomes a part of your deck with a fantastic, nasty ability to everyone else; there is no division between your Victory Points deck and your Hero deck. Like I said, simplicity is the key to this game's enjoyment. Plus, the expansions seem just as fun: shuffle into main deck and continue playing. Sometimes, ease will win out.

I had fun with this one. It's simplified Ascension mode, just buy what you can from the draft, but no refreshing intra-turn. And there's only one currency, called power. With your power, buy cards that have more power. Try and trash cards with less power. Try and buy cards which have synergies. Continue to buy bigger and better cards until you're beating the super-villains for big VPs. You're obviously limited to whatever's in the draft on your turn, so to say there's quite a bit of luck is an understatement. Of course, you still have to decide between this and that on most turns, so there's your decision point. Cards have a VP count, most VPs when the last super-villain (Legendary style) is beaten. Dead simple to setup, teach and play - that's its motto. Theming is conducive to good times, another plus. It's too simple for serious long term replay, but it's fun in the meantime.

One of the worst examples of a disconnect between theme and mechanics I have ever seen, and this is coming from a fan of Stefan Feld.  There was almost no difference between buying a villain card or a hero card.  And the powers of your initially dealt hero cards were ridiculous.  For example, Wonder woman's power was "if you buy a villain card this round, increase your draw next hand by 1".  What the heck does that have to do with Wonder Woman?  Also, "punch"  and "kick" are just denominations of money.  In a game about super heroes, shouldn't "punch" and "kick" have at least something to do with fighting?  I mean seriously, a hero can use "punch" and "kick" to purchase equipment or even another hero.  How stupid is that?

I liked this one WAY more than Legendary. It's like a less refined version of Ascension but with heroes. I liked the special powers each player got, but I'm still not really into comic books. I'd play it again, but I prefer Ascension over this any day.

Another deck building game, but with a different feel from other deck builders, because there is more interaction with other players, interaction with the cards in the discard pile and some more bad stuff than usual.

Reminds me of Ascension but worse. Marvel's Legendary is far better than this game. The illustrations are really good though and I wish Legendary's art was as nice as this games.

A beautiful but air-headed game. I don't really have any interest in playing this again, but I could be talked into giving it another go, if there wasn't anything more fun to play.

The least innovative of deck building games yet made fun by DC universe and the quick and simple gameplay.

Though sometimes that's what you want.

Almost all of my plays of this have been with my own solo variant.  This game provides a great sandbox, as is evidenced by the amount of variants people have created, including official ones like the Crisis and Multiverse methods of play.  The artwork is consistent and awesome, and even though the theme of the game isn't represented in the mechanics of the game, the mechanics are solid and the cards are pretty to look at, no matter how you choose to play.

I like this one. I know it gets hate for the theme not making sense, but that doesn't bother me as much. I like that you feel like one of the superheros using powers (ok they aren't always your powers but eh..) 

To me it's like playing Ascension but with superheroes. Is it the best deckbuilder with heroes, no but if you like DC, this is worth checking out.

RATING: 7
A standard deck-building game featuring characters from the DC Universe. You play as one of the members of the Justice League (the most well-known characters minus Martian Manhunter which was a promo card that now needs to be purchased separately). Use basic cards to buy more complex cards and build your deck from there, using combinations of cards to help you defeat the villains and add their strength to your deck. It's simple to teach and learn, but the theme is very much a copy+paste treatment. Batman using heat vision? Flash has a the lasso of truth? Lex Luthor can be in Superman's deck helping him fight... Aquaman? All this aside, the game is still fun enough and the art is well done, even if it is simply taken from the New 52 comics.

Another game in a long line of copycats. I may enjoy this one more than most (Ascension, Penny Arcade, etc) but the formula is starting to grow stale.

The DC Comics theme is perhaps both it's greatest strength and greatest weakness. It's fun to fight villains and score gadgets, but the heroes themselves are terribly unbalanced. Green Lantern, for example, will almost always trigger his ability and quickly becomes an unstoppable powerhouse. 

Overall:
If you're still excited by this particular genre of game, then you shouldn't miss it. Otherwise, save your money.

I am not a comic/superhero guy at all, but this game is a nicely crafted deck-builder that won me over on its card play.  Learned the rules and knocked out a 3-player game in less than an hour.  I'd be happy to play this one again and would likely choose it over Dominion.

I am not a fan of this game. The mechanic is similar to ascension, where you both buy and defeat creatures in the "trade row" and once you defeat those creatures they become part of your deck and now fight for you. I also don't like how some heroes can use the abilities and weapons of other heroes. (Aquaman driving the Batmobile)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Nice, fun and quick deck building game for 2-4 players. Good game that can be easily played also with nongamers. I love all the combos you can make in this game! Each Super Hero requires a different approach and the ever changing common pile keeps the game fresh. There is a small variance in the Super Villain deck, so it adds a little twist into each game. All the little good things combine into an enjoyable deck building game. The theme gives it a finishing touch with its REALLY nice artwork.

Definitely best with 2-3 players. 4-player game is somewhat slow and not as balanced as the 3-player game because you can possibly have many attack in the game. It is still enjoyable with four players. 5-player game isn't even a rational option. 

Edit. With Crisis 1,2 and 3+Justice Society+Watchmen the game feels complete, fully enjoyable experience. So many possibilities with different cards after you combine many expansions. Each expansion has made this a better and made me love it more and more. So many awesome cards and so many possibilities that it's not always trivial what cards you should buy, especially considering that you can now quite easily buy cards from the destroyed pile. Definitely the best FUN COMBO HEAVY deck building game with the expansions.

This is one of my favorite games.  I love how simple it is, yet it has great replay ability.  It is a great "gateway" deck building game and once you learn it, you can really play of Cryptozoic's DBGs.  

My one complaint is that who your "hero" is really has no bearing (they are cool abilities that do help) on the game - I would like the theme to be a little better. So like if you are Batman and buy a Batman item, you get a bonus, etc.  (JW)

Yes, the theme doesn't make too much sense when you think about it.  But that doesn't bother people when they play Dominion, does it?  I like this game for its ease of setup, low complexity, and fantastic graphics.  I've used this game to teach deck-building mechanics to friends and family members who do not game with great results.  I've played over 50 times since I bought this in Feb 13.

Fun to play and a bit of atmosphere, but the nagging feeling that there's no clear point of view makes the experience more mechanical than stirring. There's no real direct combat with your opponents.

As for the game itself, it's slightly more unbalanced and swingy than Ascension, but easier to pick-up due to having only a single resource.

A good, usually fast paced (depending on who you play with) deck building game with great graphics. 

The only negative is that the thematics don't play thru well, as in, as a DC hero you can use DC villain and super villain powers to defeat your DC hero opponents. 

If you can put this to one side though, the game is good fun and plays well. 

Looking forward to the promised expansion.

RATING: 5
This is a rather basic deck-building game with a DC Comics theme that is cool. The theme doesn't totally gel. Any of the heroes can use any of the items that truly belong to the other heroes. The unique player powers are cool, and fighting the super villains are fun and a nice twist to the basic deck building game (I know this is in other games, but this is the only other deck builder I own).

Time will tell how long it will last, but I think some solid expansions that add a bit more could give the game the flavor it needs to be a big hit. 

My group prefers this to Dominion. 

I can't decide between a 6 or 7 for this one. A few more plays will tell.

The DC Comics deck-building game is one of the simplest deck-builders I have played, but it is still fun.  It shares a lot in common with Ascension as far as mechanics go.  Simplicity leads to ease of teaching the game.  Artwork is excellent as expected.  I look forward to seeing what depth they add to the gameplay with expansions and if in the end this game does DC justice. One of the biggest problems is that the mechanics do not match the theme.

My first deck-building experience and I am really into it. Therefor my rating might go up or down with more comparable games being played. The cards are great fitting the theme, though I had the feeling the superhero characters are slightly uneven in their strength but, hey, make up for it by collecting the best cards! Quick to learn, I really enjoyed it, eager to play more!

Update: Haven't played it in years and now got my hands on a copy and still really like it. I have played several deck-builders over the years and I think it holds up very well and will have a solid spot in our collection. I like that opposed to most DBs the line-up where you buy cards constantly changes when people buy cards.

DC Comics Deck-Building Game has got to be the least inventive name for a game in the history of ever.

I'm drawn to superhero games and the combination of deck-building with combat, but I haven't found the winning game yet. It seems a chore to separate, shuffle and separate again. The card names and functions don't always connect and the theme doesn't carry through the logic of the gameplay. I'll gladly try again.

Like Ascension with better art and each individual card is fantastically well themed.  Suffers from the Ascension/Thunderstone problem of being one point shy of what you want for 3 turns, and then someone else getting it before you when you finally have what you need in hand.

RATING: 4
I am not a fan.
The choices were so limited that it was obvious what you should do. That is the same as only giving me one option.
The game may be better with more plays. Knowing all the cards in the deck might let you build to specific strategies if the right cards come up.

Strictly worse Ascension clone with a single currency and the worst feature of Cryptozoic's other deckbuilder, Penny Arcade: The Game: hyper-powered supervillain cards acting as the game timer.

As a thematic experience it's a mess -- Batman uses his super-speed to acquire Aquaman's trident and recruit Sinestro -- and as a game it's a chaotic morass of take-that slams.

Nice deckbuilding game, but nothing too special. Also, the theme is not well implemented, feels tacked on. If you want a superhero card game, I recommmend Legendary (if you want a semi-coop deckbuilder) or Vs System (for superhero battles).

Great theme play.  Very easy to learn and play.  Game plays like a lighter version of Thunderstone.  I did not get the sense that the deck building aspect was as critical as other similar games.  This game is much more flexible - multiple buys & can fight super villian then buy.  Components very good - durable cards with above average artwork.  Game length feels right at about 1.5 hours.

I've played a lot of deck-building games, but I really like this one (and I'm not even a DC comics fan). It is a little more random than Dominion, which I like. Your strategy has to be more fluid than with games like Dominion. I've played games of Dominion where the players knew the cards so well that as soon as the choices were laid out, they knew exactly what strategy they were going to use. Done deal. This game requires a little more adjusting "on the fly," so to speak.

RATING: 7
Ascension-light with better artwork.

A bit slippery, thematically, but it's fun and has great comic book artwork, which (for me) more than makes up for it. Some folks are crying foul that the super heroes attack each other with villains. As I see it, a player is temporarily assuming the role of a villain during the attack and is not (at that moment) playing the part of the hero itself. Makes sense enough to me. I mean, this is a competitive game, after all.

Light and fun is a great combination for me. If you're looking for great depth, you'd probably be better served elsewhere.

Most of my plays have utilized a fun solo variant posted here on BGG.  My original concerns that others shared (The Flash having Superman's heat vision or defeated villains in your deck) disappeared when I played the game.  It's fast, fun, and easy to teach. 

I think I burned myself out on the game by playing it a bunch in a short time span.  After several months I played this with my son...he didn't care for it.  I like it, but not enough to keep for solo play.  We like Sentinels and Legendary better when we want a super hero fix.

Update:  I traded this game awhile ago. My 6-year-old daughter likes Legendary but she wants to play as Wonder Woman...so this is the first game that I have ever reacquired.  We just played our first game and she won 54-49.

My friends and I (ages 21-26) have a blast playing this base set.  We've been playing it over 5 months now and still enjoy it as much as the first time.  The art work is amazing on the cards and really gets you into the game if your a DC fan (even some of my friends aren't big into comics and love how awesome the art is as well). I like that this set is simple and easy to learn, whereas a lot of people that don't like it have a grudge against it for not being difficult or complex enough.  I can't say that justifies a bad review? The only complaint I have with this set is how powerful it can make you if you buy the right cards with the right superhero. It can become unfair, but most of the time it levels out to be a close game.  Also, some cards such as the "Man of Steel" card are just crazy powerful in most cases.  Granted, most games I've ever played there has always been certain cards that seemed unfair or had a bigger advantage than what it should have. All in all though this base set is really fun to play with friends and is easy to pick up on if playing for your first time.

This is currently my all time favorite deck builder.  You can tell by the amount of plays it has that my play group also enjoys this one as well. 

We mostly play the Co-op version of the game but occasionally will do a PVP as well or Traitor game with the Watchmen expansion.

I have build two 120 card main decks to play with - One for Co-op and one for PVP/.  The PvP one is mostly set up as the Lantern theme.
All main decks are built from all the sets together and have a great synergy.

Made a 3D box insert for this similar to the Broken Tokens.
While less expensive in the end if I add in the time it took to print then it is more about the same.

RATING: 4
My girlfriend absolutely loves this game, but I find it too overly simplistic and broken. Choices rarely evolve past "buy most expensive card", and several cards and especially character powers can be game-breaking, without even chaining with other cards. Every other card  or ability allows you to draw a card, so turns often consist of playing a third of your deck. It is, however, far faster and easier to set up and play than Legendary (which I love), and while it gets old fast, the first time you play a million-card turn by chaining everything you own, you feel a sense of accomplishment.

Also played the Crisis expansion, which tried too hard to emulate Legendary, and became so frustratingly annoying that we actually quit halfway through.

Overall, while I don't like it, I'll play on occasion under slight duress, and would actually recommend it for a beginner's deckbuilder.

This is a great game. We much prefer this over the Marvel deck building game. they're both good, but this one is more competitive & makes you wanna say at the end of a game, "Let's play another one". Do not mix the cards with the cards from the expansion. They should be played as 2 separate decks. Each has it's own style & they are both good on their own merits.

Rating based on one play, could go up or down.

You're at the mercy of which cards happen to be available on your turn. You might need more power, but there are just low-power cards available. You need to thin your deck, but no deck-thinning cards are out. 
Also, it seems like there could be a snowball effect if one player gets a couple of powerful cards. That player can continue to buy more and more powerful cards, eventually winning most of the super villain cards and the game. This type of thing is common in deckbuilding games, but it's a bigger problem here because your opponents are powerless to do anything about it if they have an unlucky mix of cards on their turn.

The game also felt artificially long. It took several turns before any of us could regularly get enough power to start getting better cards.
I like some of the ideas here, like being able to play as many cards as you want on a turn and in any order. So far it seems like Dominion is a much better design. Will have to play again.

This game will draw obvious and inevitable comparisons to Legendary, the Marvel deck building game that was released at almost the exact same time.

DC Comics deck builder takes away some of the fiddly stuff in Legendary, and concentrates on a clean, smooth, and really fun gaming experience.  Setup is a MASSIVE breeze, with only 4 pools of cards to worry about.

The Super power of the individual player is handled well, and the competition element between gamers is also terrific.

While this might be the "simpler" of the two games, it has a indefinable addictive quality to it that comes very close to Dominion, with a little less paralysis for new players.  It might be fast and simple, but man is it great.

Easily a 9 for me right now, as I want to play it even as I am writing this comment!

RATING: 4.5
[thing=125678][/thing] is a light-ish deck building game, in which players embody famous super-heroes, like Batman, Superman, Green Lantern, Cyborg... ok, Cyborg isn't all that well known, but I know who he is just fine.

Anyway, the game uses Power as currency, and has cards for purchase in what the game calls Line Up - five cards that the player can buy, and also two more: Kicks (which, for some reason, are a super-power) and Supervillains. The Line Up works just like the central row in [thing=69789][/thing]: after you buy one or more of the cards in the Line Up, new cards will be open from the main deck for the next player. Not everyone will like this, since, you could have a turn with a good deal of Power, but only average cards to buy, and once you take one or more cards, the next ones to come are great card, which you could have taken, but just can't because they wheren't there when it was your turn. This also makes the game slow down, at least in the first games, because you have to read what the new cards that keep entering the game do.

Another thing that one can have problems with: no thematic link between what you can buy and use to the hero you represent. You can be Green Latern using the Batmobile and Heat Vision. I don't mind this all that much, but it would be nice if the each Superheroe had a deck of their own, and only the said Hero could purchase cards from there (like the way [thing=88408][/thing] has two decks of cards that only you can buy). The main deck, then, would have only generic equipament and powers, but the Heat Vision? Only in Superman's deck. I won't mind that, say, a card named Ring Blast (which would be in Green Lantern's deck) would do exactly the same thing as Heat Vision - the thing would be to have thematic link, not exclusiveness (though, some cards could have/do unique things). Well, I know this won't happen, but I like to dream.

Now, my biggest problem with [thing=125678][/thing] is the way the Supervillains cards work. They are the one of the main way to get big points - think that they are like Province cards in [thing=36218][/thing]. However, in [thing=36218][/thing] there is a huge element of timming: when to stop buying effects and coin cards and when to start to buy victory points cards - because most VPs cards won't do a thing for your deck, no, they will clog your "machine" almost to full stop (if you start to buy then too soon). This is a really nice thing in [thing=36218][/thing]. But, in [thing=125678][/thing], the Supervillains actually are a BIG help to have in your deck - so there isn't a timming here: when you can "beat" a Supervillain, just go for it. Basically, always. This, to me, seems just bad. I would like [u]much[/u] more if the Supervillains, once you put then in your deck, start to wreck things up. The attack they made in the other players when you use them, should be directed only to you - Darkseid would make you destroy two cards in your hand (the Omega Effect is a bitch); the Joker would make you discard cards, otherwise the other players would draw cards; and so on. But they don't work this way - they are, as I said, a big help - some of the best cards in the whole game - so, in this game, the rich become richer, as once a player got the first couple Supervillains, if you aren't in the same pace, you will be left behind, as the big VP card will also allow the player that took them to take more big VPs cards.

Well, with all that said, one could think that I severely disliked [thing=125678][/thing] - but, no, I actually enjoyed it, I just found it lacking in some aspects. It plays somewhat fast, it is really easy to learn (you aren't limited to 1 action and 1 buy in your turn, you can use as many cards as you want and buy as much cards as you can) and the attack cards aren't all that nasty, so this is a friendlier game than even [thing=36218][/thing], that some say is a solitaire multiplayer game. It helps that I'm a big DC fan.

[thing=125678][/thing] is far from perfect, but I sure won't mind playing it again, since it is so simple and once you know what you are doing, it plays fast.

Great game.  This was my introduction to a deck building game.  Bought it for my 11 year old son and the whole family enjoys it.    The designers did a great job of incorporating the powers and abilities of the characters into the game and the art work on the cards is fantastic.  
One complaint is that some of the actions on the cards and instructions are not written as well as they could be so things may be left to interpretation.   
Hopefully there will be an expansion soon because there are definitely some missing characters that would be great to play in this game.

My friends and I play this game on an almost weekly basis.  We love DC Comics and read them regularly, and it's clear that the designers and game testers do, as well.  The internal logic of the cards, and the way in which they relate to each other, is totally true to the spirit of the DC Universe--it's a great game!

Played this right after playing the Marvel U based Legendary.  I am a Marvel Zombie, so I *should* have enjoyed Legendary more, but I didn't.  I think the art work is better, the game flows better than Legendary.  It still doesn't feel very super heroey to me, but as a deck builder game it felt like it had a better flow to the game.

RATING: 6
This is a cross between Ascension and the Resident Evil deck-building game, with a few improvements to the RE system.  Here, instead of having a random set of creatures that you can't prepare for, each super-villain is turned over so everyone can see what's coming up, which makes it better than "Oh, I'll attack what's in the mansion deck, and ... dang, I'm dead."  Otherwise the game is pretty much straight-up Ascension, with some cards that work with the theme of the superheroes.  It's not a perfect translation of the DC Comics heroes (it's a little weird to see Batman pick up the X-Ray Vision, and to send foes out to hurt other superheroes), but otherwise it's a pretty good combination of a deck-building game and the DC canon.

Unoffensive and easy to teach to non gamers. It was cheap and easy with the variable/fixed market seriously compromising what little control players have. In all the game seemed to take a little long for what it was, but that issue may be ameliorated by really knowing the game and being familiar with the deck. 

I didn't hate it, but I'll never spend money on it. And no,  i's not exactly Penny Arcade or Ascension, though it took some bits from both.

First I am going to start off by saying that I am a huge comic book fan and when I heard about this game, I bought it instantly. I really love how easy this game is to set up and put away as well as how quick it plays. The artwork of these cards, for the most part, is ripped directly from the new DC 52 artwork(2011-present) which is awesome. I have found that there are a couple of cards that retain the older artwork which includes the Superman Superhero card, but that is fine. The gameplay is awesome and you can easily hinder your opponents and whatnot. While I was playing the game I really didn't feel like the hero that I was playing. The reason being is the way the game is designed. I can be Wonder Woman, with lantern rings and Batman's belt on, inside the Bat mobile, with Green Arrow's bow as my weapon while Sinestro is my sidekick. It really does detract from the whole, "I feel like a superhero" experience. If you really want to feel as if you are a superhero, this is not the game and I would recommend Sentinels of the Multiverse. That said, this is a wonderful addition to my collection.

OK deck builder.  I much prefer the much meaty legendary.  This one is a good game for younger kids (6-8?).  Just too simple for me.  I'm lowering my rating to compensate for the rave reviews on BGG.  This is bad game.

if you are very into theme, this could bother you-- yes, you can be wonderwoman "using" superman's heat vision or Aquaman's trident.... but if you are just out to enjoy a game, then this is simple, fun, and feels like it is over way too soon (a mark of a good game-- you want more).

simple deckbuilding fun!

A solid, simplistic deck-builder. Unfortunately, it's primary distinguishing feature (it's theme) is not very well integrated. The "arch-villains" don't feel very threatening (Darkseid is laughably wimpy) and certain cards just don't make any thematic sense.

So, if you strip away the theme, what you're left with is just an average deck-builder. Not a bad game by any means but also offering nothing to elevate it above other staples of the genre like Dominion or Ascension.

It seems like there's certain cards you'll always want to buy and you'll always want o avoid. The theme just doesn't make very much sense either when we're all heroes fighting each other, but also fighting a villian. For a superhero deckbuilding game I prefer Legendary.

Finally had first actual play. 2-player with the wife. She really enjoyed it and said she prefers it over Dominion. I enjoy both, but I know Dominion is a bit dry for her. She prefers the theme of this and the fact that cards available are constantly changing.

We played the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/127127/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-fellowship-of-the-ring-d]LOTR Fellowship of the Ring deck-building game[/url] first, and we prefer that version.  The games are nearly identical, with the exception that in the LOTR version: (1) the character cards are "real" cards that go into the player decks and (2) an impossible mode is included.  It's the very amusing impossible mode that makes the LOTR version superior.

So unless you're tied to the comic theme, you can probably skip this one.  There's no real reason to own both, which is something I wish I'd known before shelling out the cash for the DC version.

[i]Update:[/i]

Ok, it might be time to rethink my position.  The DC version, we've discovered, is just plain nutty. Compared to the LOTR fellowship game, the DC cards are clearly overpowered.  Super-powered, even.  So turns are wackier (combo this, combo that) and power totals climb exponentially as the game continues.  Cranking out 20 power isn't impossible, and the game ends quickly because getting "only" 10-12 power to kill the super villain becomes trivial.

Also, Aquaman is broken. End of story.  After my first four turns as the king of sonar, I was frankly embarrassed at how well I was doing.  So, we have our first perma-ban.

The DC game is clearly the better version for pre-teens, as it's a heaping helping of silly fun.  POW!

Based on a handful of 2- and 3-player games:
Theme: decent enough; I'm not a superhero fan.
Quality: pretty good.
Artwork: totally awesome (though a little more variation among the "common cards" - punch, vulnerability, weakness, kick - would have been appreciated).
Gameplay: I've never played Ascension, but from what I've read about it, this game is very similar to it: play cards, buy cards refill the line-up and draw cards. I'm not too fond of this: it's very luck-based. At the end of my turn Super Strength is revealed in the line-up so my opponent can buy it? Mweh. Having your deck filled with heroes while all Green Arrows are at the bottom of the main deck? Sigh. I prefer Dominion when it comes to deckbuilding, where you at least can think out some sort of strategy. 

Hopes for expansions: more Suicide Squads, different artwork for Punches etc, more variants (e.g. give each Super Hero a slight change in starter deck so they differ a little more), cards to remove opponent's Locations, more Locations, Super Heroes with more distinct abilities than "+1 Power if you play this kind of card", additional cards that are always available to buy, cards that make use of Punches and/or Vulnerabilities, a box that you don't have to put upside down to get the Super Heroes out.

Like all things comic books, it lives in the shadow of a Marvel product, but as a DC fan it was one of those games where it was exactly what I wanted once I busted it out of the box. Where Marvel Legendary has a bit of a board game element, what with the villains making their way across the board, this plays more like a pure card game. Maybe doesn't have the replayability over many many, MANY sessions compared to Legendary, but for an easy-to-teach introduction to deckbuilding games, with some of my favorite comic characters, it's a favorite of mine.

A simpler re-theme of Ascension and the father is better than it's offspring.  If you really dig DC comics or you find Legendary's set up too much work, perhaps this is worth a shot with you, but there's nothing particularly interesting here.  Takes too long for what it is as well, particularly with more than two players.

It's growing on me.  I still think Ascension is better, but this is good as a filler with two players.  I don't play it with more than 2 though.

Now I bought Sentinels of the Multiverse, and that game renders this and Legendary expendable.

i give the game a 5.5 compare to the 6.5 of Legendary Marvel because the game is mainly for new players and maybe the most simple deck building game since it simplify the two resources from Ascension to only power as both money and power.So
 the game is only about power and points.But the game is lack of replayability and long term strategies,and i started get bored after 4 games.

Crazy deckbuilder that has a lot of mechanics I've not seen yet in deckbuilders like Star Realms and Acsension.  Heroes have individual powers, villains screw with your opponents' decks, and discard recycling give this a completely different vibe that matches the superhero milieu well.  

Fun and not too competitive, so very wife-friendly.

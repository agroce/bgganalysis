I needed a good game for my checkers set, and this was it.  Listen, if you think you're having fun playing checkers, you're not.  Play this game instead.  The rules sound odd, but when you play it, it reveals itself to be an elegant, flawlessly simple game of surprising depth.  I LOVE this game!

And Checkers?  Checkers schmeckers.

A fine abstract in which the aim is to connect all your pieces.  Capturing is a double edged sword; it may prevent connection, but it also reduces the number of pieces your opponent has to connect.  A bit of a classic.

There are many, many abstracts out there that you can play just using a chess board and pieces or maybe with printing out a different grid size or shape.  This one is one of the more popular and justifiably so.  Very simple rules and offers something quite different from chess, Go and some of the other abstracts out there.  Certainly enough for this to be fresh and well worth giving a try.

Playable on a standard chess board with standard draughts pieces, this doesn't need a dedicated board. However its simplicity belies a stunningly strategic game. Clever enough and enjoyable enough for me to want my own copy in the nice wooden box with cloth board.

RATING: 6
Not my favorite kind of game, too dry, but I can recognize it's a pretty good one.
Each move has a great impact on how other pieces may move, so it's hard to plan ahead too much, which makes me think it's more tactical than strategic (though there are some strategic principles).

---

Reading gets easier with time! You can't read ahead too much, still, but it does get better and faster. Now, I'm not sure it has a lot of strategic variety, but I've learned to enjoy it. Maybe it'll get better with some variants, we'll see.

Yeah, I'm a bit burn out on it. And I didn't really get to try any variants. I'm much more attracted to trying out Ayu or Volo instead.

RATING: 6
The whole capture helps us both out mechanic is very interesting. The simple rules are certainly appealing.

However, one of the aspects I didn't like is that some times I don't see that my opponent is one move away from winning and I can easily block it. I don't, then I lose. I find those victories and losses unsatisfying.

Other than that, it is not clear without counting which pieces can move where, making the game longer than I want it to be. If I'm waiting for my turn, I want it to be because my opponent is thinking about what to do, not trying to calculate what they are allowed to do.

Update days later... I still think it is a very cool game, but i am just not engaged in the effort of asessing the board. Yes, i am lazy. For some reason, i dont want to take the time to figure out where the strengths are, where the liabilities are. Who was it that talked about 'clarity'? Robert Abbott. I just dont have it in this game.

I normally wouldn't rate a game so highly without having played with human opponents, but this game really blew me away. It reminds me very much of Dvonn, but without the shrinking board that becomes a duel of look-ahead. Traditional concepts of space, tempo, and material are turned on their head. A connection game like none I've played. (Owned as a checkers board and pieces.)

RATING: 9
Incredibly dynamic game with deceptively simple rules. At first glance what seems an obvious move may not necessarily be so. For instance:Capturing opponents pieces may be tactically sound but strategically weak. A very clever game that will always find a place at my table.

I had a difficult time with the rules and winning conditions at first, but once it clicked, I saw the brilliance of the game. Very cool.

RATING: 5
I find this game somewhat irritating to play.  The board-state changes so dramatically from move to move, that your ability to look ahead and anticipate your opponent is somewhat limited.  

It's similar to Yinsh in that respect, which seems to be an attractive feature for people who don't typically enjoy abstract games.  You can play intuitively, move by move, and if your opponent is doing the same, you can have some exciting back-and-forth games, rather than just "better player dominates."  That's not to deny that there's skill involved (as I'm sure there's plenty), but it's so opaque that casual play in sporadic bursts isn't enough to reveal it.  

But while I think the "it's an abstract I can get my wife to play" factor skews the ratings for these types of games somewhat, I still have to give LoA credit for being a very interesting, wholly original game.  It I had a few more lifetimes, I might try to learn it better, but in this one, it simply failed to hook me.

There's a lot of calculating to be done and it felt more about that than about strategy.

By the 3rd game, I saw the potential for maybe employing an overarching strategy though. I'd be interested to see if I did start to uncover better moves and developed a better understanding of it, or if it remains somewhat confusing and opaque until the final few moves.

This game could lead to a lot of analyisis-paralysis but I'd be interested to try it out in real-life.

RATING: 4
I quite like the line movement dynamics; they make pieces that are potentially across the board meaningful in a local sense, and they make things like connection order useful. And after playing it, I thought the rules did work with a reasonable degree of elegance. (Before playing, I thought the "can jump over your own pieces, but can only land on opponents" rule needlessly complex. But I see how it enables blocking and connection in a way that "you can always jump" or "you can never jump" doesn't.)

My problem was the way movement was used. (Obviously, just played for the first time, so take what I say with a large grain of salt.) Games of movement that I enjoy tend to feature a narrative arc that culminates in a climax of some sort. In chess, there's the possibility of a surprise attack on the king, possibly involving sacrificing material. In Tzaar, there's the continual possibility of a sudden-death capture (or two captures) that eliminates a piece type. Amazons and Hey That's My Fish end with pieces battling for control of what's usually a large area for the fate of the game.

LoA didn't seem to end as well. It seems that a lot of the interesting blocking and back-and-forth happened in the early game, and looking at opening discussions this appears to be the case in advanced games as well. You want a well-connected group that exists toward the center of the board that blocks of your opponent; once you have that, connection of the pieces just takes some time. Your opponent can block, but that'll prevent him from making his connection and it is a race game.

I also feel the clarity suffers relative to other connection games, even the weird ones like Omega or Slither. Clarity generally suffers in games of movement, but I tend to prefer games with 1) smaller numbers of pieces (Amazons, HtmF) or 2) shrinking endgames with dramatic reversals of fortune (Chess, Tzaar). LoA doesn't seem to have that clarity, so the fun thrust-and-parry that I like in abstracts doesn't show up as much. This doesn't mean it's a bad game, just that it's not for me.

RATING: 7
Simple to learn and super fun to play! Yes, this game is half about the movement rule (where pieces must move the total number of spaces equal to the number of pieces in the line) but the objective of having all pieces connected and how your opponent capturing your pieces can help this objective is really what makes this game very intriguing. Plus, it's over in about 10-15 minutes and there's always the feeling of wanting to play another one. It also gets into situations where you play very carefully, hoping that your opponent doesn't set up a winning scenario for themselves.  Lines of Action is an early game that deserves to be known by all. I can see why it wasn't published until long after its release: it really only needs a checkerboard and checker pieces. But seriously, the rules should be included in every checker box.

I don't feel the need to list this game as owned (and pad my games-owned number) as it's merely a game that can be played with a checkers set.  Having said that, it is an excellent game, very "Gipf-ish" if you ask me.  I was tickled when Josh, my nine year old grandson, beat me fair and square in our fourth game.However, I no longer own a King Kong Checkers Set.  It is actually a King Kong Lines of Action Set, and I've logged it as such.  LoA is a great 2 player abstract, period.

I highly recommend those who own a Siesta game to play LoA in a 12x12 format.  Capturing becomes more important with the larger format and therefore, more entertainment is to be had.

Hey what a beast!  

This has good depth and almost no rules, looks like we are talking Burm quality here. I can't believe this game has been around close to as long as I have and I just discovered it now! (1969 and I owned it all that time too! [checkers board essentially])

Strategies are elusive at first as there are many move possibilities all with their own ramifications (and some have quite a few) but not more so than chess (at least I dont think so but maybe or close!)

It is a tricky game and one worth exploring I think where movement rules are so simple yet so interesting and capturing pieces is a "questionable" move and not just a given like most abstracts since you could be helping your opponent. Should be lots to explore here I would think, going for and controlling center could be key but I am early into games here. 

Should take from 10 - 30 minutes tops depending on your style of play, some games can be whipped off in 5 minutes and then you want to play again. 

[u]Update:[/u] After a few games things really start to come together, you need to give it that chance unless you just abhor abstracts which many do. One cool strategy to try is to trap one of the opponents pieces and try to keep it trapped while manouvering the rest of your pieces into position.

Quite a lot of fun, as far as abstract games go.  I still can't figure out whether it is better to have more checkers or fewer checkers.  Easy to learn.

I've only played this against computer AIs (thus no rating), but I quite like this quick but rich abstract.  The rules are about as simple as checkers (LoA is played with a checkers set), but the game play is much more rewarding, and probably plays faster to boot.  Once I get this on the table against a flesh and blood opponent or two, I would expect to rate this an 8 or so.

UPDATE: Got to play against human competition (5 games), and really like it.  LoA is completely different from any other two player abstract (and by extension, any boardgame) I have ever played, although it is probably a bit closer to the GIPF-series games than it is to traditional abstracts.  The nebulous value of capturing opposing pieces (sometimes it's a tactical necessity, but it has the strategic downside of leaving your opponent with fewer pieces to connect) makes the mindset very different from Chess, checkers, or even other indirect aggression games like YINSH and GIPF.  Factor in the elegantly agonizing movement rules, and LoA is at the very least a high second-tier abstract, and further play (with the accompanying greater comfort with this slightly odd game) could move it into the top tier with Go, Chess and YINSH.  Clearly a far better use for a checkers set than checkers could ever dream of being.

UPDATE: Many more plays, and this is a premiere abstract game, better even than a couple of the GIPF project games. Subtle, deep, yet normally quick-playing. Highly recommended. A 9.

The concept of this game is so interesting, and the rules create a game board that's constantly shifting with each subsequent move. Each piece on the board affects the movement abilities of every other piece in its path and I really love the way that works.

That being said, to me the game feels a bit simple in practice. Not that the movement strategy isn't complex...it is. It's more that the movement and the general flow of the game starts to feel stale and devoid of character after several rounds. Everyone just has pieces and they move them and that's it. I guess you can boil every abstract board game down to that, but with Lines of Action there's no boiling it down. It's just that. I keep it around for a round or two here and there, but it doesn't get brought out very often.

Very impressed by this one. I am still a beginner of this game but it is really good. Could be one of the best 2-palyer abstracts.

Well worth the effort of getting to know this clever game.  Considered a classic for a reason . . .

Amazing, deep and very elegant abstract that can be played with a draughts set: the goal is to connect all the pieces, which start aligned on opposite sides of the board, and move an amount of spaces in a straight line equivalent to the pieces available in that line. Jumping over enemy pieces is not allowed, and if an own piece lands on an enemy piece, the enemy piece is taken. That means the enemy has got one piece less to connect to the others, so measuring the effect of taking pieces isn't a trivial task - the game's actually very difficult to master.

Too abstract for regular play for my tastes, but even after one play you can tell this is a way more interesting way of spending time with these checkers pieces than it is playing checkers. Very simple rules, minute to learn, lifetime to master, yada, yada, yada.

A great abstract game, very original by the time and very deep.
Its complexity is high: at every turn players have a large number of possible choices (depending from the match and the phase of the game, of course). This game complexity is near to chess, although the game is shorter, and higher than Reversi and checkers.
Eating is one of the most difficult choices of the game, giving you the immediate advantage of a good position vs. making opponent&#039;s life easier by taking away one of his stones.

Abstract game that can be played with a chess set. Looks sorta like Go light. The board and pieces linked to this listing make it much more appealing.

This is stupid good!

I like the cluelessness of the opening game, and the tenseness of the mid and end game.

I like how the game is initially counter-intuitive; unlike many other abstract strategy games, you shouldn't capture at every opportunity! I also like all the blocking tactics the game presents!

Though I'm horrible at it, LoA is a very engaging abstract.

Great 2 player game, although I prefer the dynamism of a game like Crossings/Epaminandas where the pieces move even though LoA is a deeper game.

Next time the only thing you have is a set of checkers....don't despair.  Learn and play the game Lines of Action.  It's not a bad abstract game using only the components of a checker set.

I'd heard this pure strategy game recommended for years, and it didn't live up to the hype for me.  (Played once sometime in 2006 before I started logging games; more importantly, before I got really into abstract strategy games as a genre...) Possibly I need to try it more.

2010-10-30: Yep, I like it more now that I like abstract strategy games more. Upgraded from 5 to 7. :)

2012-12-14: Upgraded to 8. :)

A fascinating abstract strategy game with an unusual move mechanic. Tactics seem to involve building and breaking barricades, while enabling and interdicting lines of play.

This game is sort of like a cross between chess and checkers.  It can be played with a traditional set of checkers and a checkerboard.  It can be played online at  http://www.boardspace.net .

If you are into abstract games this would be considered a modern classic.  If you aren't it will be a bit boring.  There are many factors to take into account.  It seems like you really could take 10 minutes figuring out what the best move is, but it would only give you a little bit of an edge over a 30 second move.  Still it may be the winning edge.  Not a bad game at all, but certainly not for me.

Great way to play a fairly solid abstract game on a checkers board. The rules are really simple, but they make for some good decisions and there are still a fair number of options.

Modern abstracts just don't interest me as much as the classics, but Lines of Action is enjoyable.  Besides, if you own a checkers set, you own this game--so you might as well try it, right?

The concept is solid, and I love the idea that capturing your opponent's pieces can in some cases make it easier for him to win the game. My reservation is that I find calculating movement to be opaque and difficult to strategize around.

Probably the best abstract game I tried for the first time this year, and there have been quite a few thanks to the Astoria Gaming Society. A fairly old game from the 1960s that I'd never heard of, let alone played, before. I try not to use the descriptor "elegant" too much as it means something different to everyone and is thus impossible to define precisely, but this game did feel elegant to me. That is to say, it felt like the rules made sense, like when you heard them, you felt that is the way they should be, and were always meant to be. The game felt coherent and easy to wrap your head around, but still challenging and engaging.

This one of the few abstracts I really enjoy. This is a very ellegant game, with very easy rules but with a great scope for clever movements. I love the nice strategic balance between capture or not capture and the winning condition. This is not a worse game than many other Gipf series (leaving off aesthetics), and you can play it with a checkers set!.

One of the most elegant abstract games ever. Simple rules but the game is addictive... and at the same time it gives me a slight sensation of poor replayability.... it's a paradox ! One of the best aspect is that you lose pieces and ur task becomes easier (less pieces to join) but at the same time harder (less mobility)!

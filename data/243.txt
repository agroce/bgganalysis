Ten years ago, this was the only game I played.  Now I play it in one month blocks.  I review the rules, play 3 or 4 scenerios and then move on to another game for the next month.  It is helpful to play a couple of months each year to keep familiarity with the rules.  I want to make sure I keep variety in my gaming, but this is one incredible game.

RATING: 8
El Rey de los juegos tácticos desde hace lustros, siguiendo el éxito de SQUAD LEADER y sobre todo CROSS OF IRON. Pero la excesiva complejidad limita un tanto la jugabilidad. El realismo en los juegos es algo relativo, o al menos subjetivo, Y los diseñadores parecen olvidar que la regla más realista no es necesariamente la más compleja. A las pruebas me remito: quién juega habitualmente los escenarios con Apoyo Aéreo, combate nocturno, O.B.A., bocage, etc. No hay más que ver las estadísticas de los escenarios más jugados. Pero ello no quita, desde luego, que el juego sea divertido, competitivo, tenso, variado y todos los calificativos que queráis

Owned this for many years - mine is a 1985 copy, and so probably well out of date.

Read the rules - like studying for an exam.

Maybe I might try a starter kit some time, to dip my toe into ASL waters, but for now, Combat Commander and Panzer Grenadier have my attention, especially since both have Aussie battles including Kokoda Track (yes that's the correct designation, not Kokoda Trail).

A lifetime commitment game (and I am not willing to commit - too many other games out there) but no game offers turns of fortune like this system.  You can be playing and be absolutely out of the game - ready to resign - and one second later, back in it and winning.  Worth the accolades but such a financial and time commitment!

From the hottest review: This looks like it could be tremendously fun. I don't mind lots of rules and lots of scenarios and playing serious, but the length of the game is considerable and finding enough time to play this game more than a handful of times seems like a hard task 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A "9" rating has a more appropriate shade of green. As complex as flying a large passenger jet, which is why all those pilots fall asleep every day. After the first 2000 hours or game turns you'll be wanting rules for pregnant camels, as the simplicity of the system is magnified by the completeness of the rules. Hard to learn, easy to teach, very hard to survive. The same rules are used again and again, and this can be boring. Incredibly robust, so it still functions when abused. Real 1940s lessons can be derived from ASL, some of whch were not appreciated at the time. Worth it for the gun and vehicle notes alone, which should be published in book form.

I only played [i]The Guards Counter-Strike[/i] scenario and it was taught to me by the best wargame teacher out there.  The scenario was tense and it was great fun.  There was much to like, especially rules for snipers, commissars, residual fire, and machine guns rate of fire and fire line (?).  It had a very strong sense of theme.

I think it is a game I would be happy to mooch off of others more than plunging in and buying it.  I could see how you would have dedicate a great deal of work to stay on top of the rules and the system.  If you are so dedicated, you could get a lifetime of joy from the game and never run out of opponents to play with.

RATING: 9.5
The mother of all wargames with rules to cover just about every possible situation.  As a result, be prepared to invest a ton of time learning how to play.  Start with starter kits and go to tournaments to get involved.  The community of ASL players is very willing to help get those interested up to speed.  

The game is not for everyone.  Pass if you don't have lots of time and patience, and some spare cash to start you off.  But if you want what I feel to be the ultimate wargaming experience ... you must explore what this game has to offer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
The original Squad Leader was a classic. Each subsequent expansion added more and more complexity, and revised the rules revisions introduced by earlier expansions. So in theory ASL was the answer to a maiden's prayer, but I soon decided to call it a day as I preferred the more hardware-oriented tactical games like Jim Day's Panzer/88/Armor and Hal Hock's Tobruk. More recently, I prefer the simplicity and elegance of Mark Walker's Lock'n'Load where each expansion adds more maps, counters and scenarios but precious few rules. But of course there's plenty of folk who think otherwise...

RATING: 7
Doesn't have quite the 'making it up as we go' edginess of SL+, nor indeed the nostalgia hit for me.  It also loses a point (on this entirely subjective 'do I want to play it now?' rating system) for being the kind of thing I don't have anywhere near the time for these days.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
There is no game that offers so much depth, tactical options and strategic game play all at once. This is not a game, but a lifestyle, once you have learned the basics.

The complexity is minimal to learn if taught by another gamer. Seriously, once you have learnt the system, the game play options are enormous.

Every game I played is so tense that I felt I have missed a heart beat in each and every die roll moments.

An excellent system that NONE other has ever come near to it.

In board wargames, this is the holy grail.

Number of 'plays' actually reflects the number of times I had to sit down and seriously read-and-re-read some rules to have a better understanding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I taught myself to play this and it's pretty cool, but I have some mostly minor gripes. 

I'm not crazy about the scale. Being able to stack a whole platoon in a hex isn't something I'm really interested in doing in a squad scale game. A side effect of this is that the counter-fiddle factor is really high. I've only played on VASL and I don't think I could handle the physical product. Fields of Fire was too much for my arthritis and this seems worse. 

I'm also not thrilled with how morale is handled. Only having one self rally and needing leaders for anything else doesn't sit quite right with me. It's not a deal breaker but I'd prefer a little more action in this department. 

I'd rather have a Combat Commander style deck to keep track of the various things that can take place with the dice rolls. Not for the card-driven aspect, just the rolling. I tend to get distracted and forget to pay attention to that stuff. Honestly I'd rather draw from a deck rather than roll dice, again for the fiddle-factor. Maybe an android app or something would work, though it would be awful to have electronics be theoretically mandatory. 

I know the highly structured nature of the game and the turn phases can produce some artifacts like skulking but frankly when you get this complex gaming the system is half the fun. I'm also not really crazy about "Do X in Y turns" scenarios in tactical games because it can become very hard to win if you whiff a couple of dice rolls early that put you behind schedule (or the opposite, early blowouts). The couple scenarios I played were exactly that. I like a bit of random game length and multiple victory conditions. I'm sure some of that exists but it doesn't seem standard.

Honestly I could probably get into learning the game if I had a regular opponent that wanted me to play with them where all I had to do was learn the rules, but in terms of something I'm willing to pursue on my own it's a no-go. As it stands it's a solid six that could theoretically be a seven or eight with an enthusiastic opponent. It's a shame that the starter kit rules strip out so much of the interesting stuff or else that might be a viable option for me. As it stands they're pretty dull.

I really like the way the game looks on the table. I keep an eye out for new pictures and replay videos. Like Magic, this is a game that's fun to follow.

If there were a game as complex as ASL but with modern design sensibilities and less counter density I would probably be a huge fan of it.

25 Jan 07:  Filled with such a vast number and wide variety of elements, from maps to equipment to cardboard soldiers, each and every item with its own distinct characteristics, that the challenges and enjoyment are never-ending.  Certainly the rules can be overwhelming, but played with only those rules you want to use, the game is as accessible as its previous incarnation, Squad Leader.  This is one of those games which provoke any number of afterthoughts, along the lines of, "if only I had done this differently..."

RATING: 10
By far THE best squad - level game. The scenarios are so tense and have a great replayability. And the system is not so difficult as one might assume just looking at the rulebook. Leave out the OOBs and drop the stuff you don't need as a beginner (f. ex. the Pacific), look up the scenario in advance and check if there are any "oddities" and there you go. It will reward your patience diggin' into the system.

Love this game. One of the finnest simulations on WWII tactics. Expensive and hard to learn, but well worth it. It covers all facet of WWII tactical battles - everything. Look at the sheer amount of work being put into the game. No wonder it is called the King of wargames. It is a hobby into itself and if you are into it, it can be the only thing you play for years, since there are so many scenarios, fanzines and continuous production of products that your money and time can be sucked into it forever and ever. People often complain the complexity of the rules, but I can say it is not very complicated. The main mechanic of the rules lie in the phases of a turn, if you get it down (by playing a lot off course) then it is basically a fairly complex game. Since not all rules are used. There are ways to teach it. Plus MMP is producing a introduction to ASL which will be avialable soon...

Finally played ASL at Kubla Con. I am so glad I finally learned the rules. This is easily one of the best games I have ever played. It just feel like distilled squad level war gaming (probably because all modern squad level war gaming seems to come from this). I will gladly play this at any opportunity. My struggle now becomes getting someone I know to learn the system.

An incredibly absorbing game that, if you are so disposed, can provide you with an enormously rewarding journey. It can take years to become even competent at ASL, depending on your frequency of play and how willing you are to absorb the rules, but is surprisingly simple in many ways and so it is quite possible to play quickly. Addictive beyond compare, fascinating, exciting, colorful, and heartbreaking all at the same time, with unlimited replay value; in short, everything a great wargame should be.

I base my rating slightly on my brief 'real' experience, but also some of the SK experience.

I really like this system.  It seems to mesh everything I would want in a WWII tactical system without being more complex than it needs to be.  Sure, it's a tough time to learn, but having someone teach it really makes it a lot simpler.  Haven't got around to adding tanks, I don't know how much that will change my experience, but so far it's been entirely positive!

Started paying this in 1991 . A friend introduced me to SL, but after playing 1 or 2 scenarios, we figured it was better to upgrade...it was a tough learning curve but it was the game we played almost exclusively for the next 5 or 6 yrs years, logging around 50 plays annually. Definetely helps to have a regular playing partner or someone to talk you through the rules rather than trying to master it on your own.

My rate of play has slowed, particuarly in the last couple of years, but it's a game I keep coming back to and plunging into the action without too much relearning of the rules.I also had the good foresight to buy official stuff when it came out, so never have a problem of not being able to play a scenario due to missing counters or maps...

I can understand the gripes about the size of the rulebook, but after all these years I can pretty much play with the QRDC in from to me and very little rules referencing. The thing that does take a while to learn is tactics that will minimise your losses, use all available advantages and achieve victory.

Whilst difficult to learn initially, once you learn sequence of play it's like riding a bicycle. Play via VASL as well as FTF. Like playing with, and against, the Japanese and strangely, enjoy fighting scenarios with the Italians...

This game is an achievement.  The artwork, the presentation, the thoroughness of the rules and the incredible variety and depth of the  campaigns and scenarios.
I've played hundreds of different games but ASL is and always will be head and shoulders above them all.

You can play other games in addition to ASL but you'll be so immersed you won't want to.
I agree with Chris Farrell that ASL is probably not a game that can be recommended to anyone.  If ASL is for you, you will know it.

RATING: 1
The height of the 1980s monster game craze, this one has the same problems that all games of that era had - a distinct lack of realism caused by poor or nonexistent morale and command/control rules combined with rules that make weapons way too effective. Add to that a rulebook that makes the Holy Bible seem like an afternoon's light read, and you have a game that is both unplayable and unrealistic.

If I ever want to spend six months of my life getting a squad of cardboard soldiers to cross a road, I'll run out and buy this game. Needlessly complicated rules and the game achieves no greater realism than any other game. Completely hopeless and boring. Any other game - ANY other game - is more fun and more historically accurate.

Get a life after playing this one. Best board simulation of WW2 tactical combat ever. Buy it and show its ... 620 + pages of bible formatted (2 columns) to every gamer who thinks he's a rules lawyer.
Problem is that ASL takes so much time and effort to play...

And as of Oct 2015 it simply was bypassed by the Conflict of Heroes SOLO expansion. Far smoother and faster to play with enough different hardware to satisfy the average wargamer. The latter is only limited to the Eastern Front atm though...

If you want to play it without worring about how a halftrack is affected on a muddy slope as its towing an 88' with a full crew and squad complement as it tries to manuever around a tank.....play Combat Missions on the PC ;0)

I've spent probably 2/3 of my gaming time in the last 20 years playing ASL. There is so much depth to it--practically every nationality, vehicle and gun in WW2 is represented--and there is a thriving community of magazines, websites, 3rd party products, and clubs and tournaments all over.

My one problem with the system is fog of war, but for that reason HASL is the most fun. With other scenarios too often you know the opponent has (say) 1 anti tank gun, and once you have found it you feel unrealistically safe. But more and more scenario designers seem to be getting around this problem by putting in variable OOBs (usually through purchase) and the like. If you have the time and the right opponent, a HASL campaign game is really the apex of gaming in my opinion.

This comment has to be shared with all expansions. I've been an ASL grognard, but I'm no more now. The game is quite interesting and not so much difficult once grasped the basic concepts. Of course to play in the desert or in the jungle means to study a lot of chrome additional rules, but if you arrive to play module 10 you know what you will meet. Today I'm less and less interested in micro tactical boardgames, for I prefer grand strategy. That the reason for my vote. It's a game that based just on the frequency I want to play would deserve a 2, but I cannot deny it's well made and gives a lot of satisfaction do die hards players.

Simply the best Wargames at tactical level. Very difficult but, when you play the first time, you enter in a new world of simulation. All situation are covered from the rules and the use of the die are the very last part of lucky that exist in reality. You may recreate all the WWII in every front, Europe, Africa, Pacific. You may learn play this game at step, using at start only Infantry e support weapon, and after you can insert, Gun, mortar and finally the Armour and Veichles. You can find many many ASLers on internet that can teach how to play this game also online. Thank to the MMP that reprint this game!

Just bought ASL2. Now consuming/reading.
Have had Squad Leader since 80's. Suddenly got the urge/bug to dive in and enjoy these in-depth, highly rated rules. There's much support material available around the net, but it's stashed in various sites. Appears to be a lot of friendly players around who are willing to assist and offer helpful guidance. Also take a look at the VASL/VASSAL system - you'll be pleasantly surprised at what it can do for your gaming experience.

Not a bad game, just a little demanding and beardy for my taste. Not as complex as many detractors would make it out to be, but still more involved than many die-hard supporters will admit. The core system is quite functional, if a bit dated. I still poke around at it from time to time, but if given a choice I’ll usually pass on it in favor of one of the more recent ‘tactical’ games on the market. The robust ASL gaming community is generally a good thing for the hobby, although the few players who have elevated it to something akin to Cargo Cult status can be a bit scary at times.

-After playing through this game three time solo using the best of the many player aides that can be found I have found myself completely absorbed in the system. Although this sounds terrible, while I am teaching my self the game I am happy to play solo as the rules are a substitute for an opponent. I mean this in a positive way as understanding and implementing the rules correctly is a kind of mental puzzle, like sudoku for people who like military history. It is satisfying to begin to understand the system and the little stories that unfold on the mapboards are compelling.

The perfect game... almost. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This has to be the perfect game - carefully-written, endlessly-playtested, a rule for every occasion written as unambiguously as possible, and an index that works. That they accomplished all of this before the internet is incredible.

It's not for everyone - it's damn complex in parts. Vehicles and OBA are just two examples. The complexity of infantry is enjoyable, But I feel like sometimes the complexity is a little needless. Only sometimes, and only a little. 

Another big problem is the sheer unavailability of many of its component modules, and the complex interdependancies for many of them.

Make no mistake, if you like this game you will want to play nothing else.

EDIT: after finally sorting and storing my counters (and thus being ABLE to play), and starting to understand the concealment and vehicle rules, I'm bumping this up to a 10. It doesn't matter to me as much as it did four games ago that a lot of stuff isn't available, I have over 100 scenarios and at 2 games a fortnight I'm hardly about to exhaust that.

EDIT2: I have a horrible feeling Combat Commander might have killed this for me. The last two times we've tried to pull ASL out the HUGE rules overhead has scared us off and we've pulled out CC:E instead. ASL has tanks, but they are so rules-intensive and there are so few one or two-tank scenarios that we just don't play them, so we might as well be playing CC:E. It's a real shame as I don't like a number of aspects of CC:E, and do like much of ASL. I've also spent a lot of cash on ASL - at least it doesn't drop in value. Dropping my rating as a result.

EDIT 3: Now that I've really got into playing the game, I am happy to up this ranking again. This is standing the test of time in a way that CC:E just isn't.

If you can get past the monolithic rulebook you will find one of the finest squad level wargames ever written.  *edit I'm upping my rating based on more plays*  Now that I have a regular FtF opponent I can see why ASL fans love this game so much.  Just a ton of depth and well the game is just fun.  Seems like every scenario we play something memorable happens and we are left wanting more.  It's not for everyone but ASL is definitely for me.

*edit*. After many plays, years and a few "tournaments" my opinion of ASL has soured.  It's still a great system but I'm finding it less and less enjoyable.  Often I would just rather play something else and I am considering selling off my collection.  It was a good run but I'm done.

I sold my entire collection 11/2014 and I have no regrets.

own all official and many 3rd party ASL-- some is for trade-- contact me

ASL is a lifestyle.  No other game presents the choices that ASL does. To the beginner it seems that it is a game of firepower.  After some experience, it is primarily a game of maneuver. The skill is in moving your squads to the right place to create pressure and your leaders to support them.  Moving them together is seldom the right choice.  In the end, this is not a game that everyone will enjoy, but it is the most challenging game ever.  It allows you to do just about anything, and is a blast to boot.  

What other game could I play with my 6 year old son and have him ask: "can I get a panzerfaust?" I then watched my T-34/85 burn.  Simply the best!

I started my son very early and now when we play other things, he usually asks, "why don't we just play ASL?"

Of course, you need to mortgage the house to own it all.

Many rules, yes, but the game's mechanics are actually quite simple.  The absolute best tactical WWII game ever made.  I'll admit it's not for lightweights, but not every game need be designed for families with 1.3 children.  

ASL is actually somewhat underutilized and underappreciated in the wake of recent tactical WWII themed games.  ASL is a better alternative to many if not all, and its Starter Kits should not be overlooked if you like what you see from the Memoirs and CC:Es of the world.

Regras "básicas" para o sistema Advanced Squad Leader, além delas varios módulos de expansão trazem novos capítulos para as regras aumentando ainda mais a complexidade do jogo. Falam maravilhas, mas nunca encontrei tempo para aprender ou jogar, nem quem estivesse disposto a tal, eu esperava um dia faze-lo depois de toda a grana que investí no sistema, mas, nesse meio tempo descobrí o ATS, e o mais provável é que a série ASL fique encostada, pelo menos por enquanto. 

A nota baixa (ao básico e todos os módulos) se deve apenas ao fato de não ter jogado, pois estou certo de que é um grande jogo.

Solid game, but more of a lifestyle than a game due to the huge amount of rules and time investment required.Game was extremely complicated and not that realistic actually IMHO as it was designed by armchair historians that didn't portray the chaotic nature of real firefights where you didn't have as much control over your soldiers as the game gives you. Everything in game happens in an orderly, efficient and clinical manner where you get to move and fire everything as you proceed thru the sequence of play. Gaming has evolved since then but at the time it satisfied that WW2 tactical itch admirably

This is my epiphany review. ASL is like owning a boat.  The two best times I had with ASL were the excitement of getting new modules and HASLs, and again when I sold it all away.  I finally concluded that ASL has become lost in its own system (air combat in the rules?...is that really needed for a tactical ground combat game?).  Too many components, boards, overlays, charts, rules. Festung Budapest with 30+ pages of rules finally finished me. However much they try to add realism though rules and components, ASL fails misserably in the command and control department with every unit doing what you want them to do when you want them to do it. Actually no command control rules at all! A massive flaw.  There is no tempo and certainly no speed of play like the original squad leader had...quick decision making (a hallmark of tactical combat) is not present here; its been replaced by plodding rule and chart determinations and overall gameyness of play (lets swing that turret around to dump the squad off). ASL needs a major facelift both graphically (hello, its not 1977 anymore!) and in its self-indulgent rule tome.  But its too late for that now, better to put the old girl down. With the LnL system, Combat Commander, Conflict of Heroes, and Fighting Formations...there are way way better squad gaming options that portray tactical combat with the speed and excitement it deserves and even those have issues. Anything under company level does not allow for an abstract buffer to enable balanced playable/realistic board play. ASL is a bogged (die roll for bogging please) tournament only game now, because it takes too long to play any scenario of substance. ASL is a system where mathmatical analysis trumps split second decision making...totally and ridiculously unrealistic in tactical combat.  Oh how we wished for playable historical modules back in the 70s...it was not to be.  The idea that ASL is "the ultimate game of tactical combat in WWII" is undoubtably the biggest wargame myth in this hobby. I sold it all and will never look back.

RATING: 4
First off, despite the low rating, this game should be a "must have" for anyone who wants to see a complete tactical level WWII game.  It has the most complete ruleset I have ever seen.

That said, it suffers from Combat Results Table Syndrome, which is simply a mathematical play on odds.  Honestly, I loved playing the game until I realized it became a game of mathematics.  At that point, my enjoyment factor diminished drastically.  I know other games suffer from this as well, but ASL requires so many die rolls it ceases to become enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A genuine classic of wargaming although one which trades on  competition rather than a worthwhile representation of combat. Detail here masquerades as accuracy, generating only faux historicity and rules lawyering.

Actual tenets of squad level infantry combat (find, fix, flank, finish, for example) are almost completely ignored by the ruleset, happening only by accident in edge cases rather than as a doctrinal centrepiece. Command and control is entirely absent. As a result, the game offers almost no insight into WW2 tactical combat.

The modular board/countermix/overlays means that it isn't something you can dip into, except in the Starter Kits. At least they allow you to discover the flaws for yourself at a fraction of the cost.

Has its flaws:

1.  You have perfect command and control over your troops
2.  You have perfect knowledge of terrain
3.  You have perfect knowledge of opponent's objectives
4.  You have perfect knowledge of opponent's strengths and weaknesses
5.  Significant amount of gamey tactics, known as ASL "sleaze"
6.  Rules overhead--to play well, you virtually have to pass the bar exam testing your knowledge of the rulebook; AND keep playing to prevent knowledge loss.  There are fan-created advanced sequences of play that remind me of the task cards/checklists used by the Apollo astronauts!

But, the best simulation of a WWII movie.  As long as a scenario is limited to five or less game turns, infantry only, and limit the time you can use to think about moves (chess clock?), then you can play it for theme, narrative, detail and even fun.  Add in armor, and it bogs down tremendously.

Edit:  Rereading my comments, rating really should be downgraded.  Now rates a "5."  Sadly, like a sports superstar that stayed too long, this system should be retired.  

I've played Band of Brothers, and it's eye-opening just how elegant that system is, and far more realistic in terms of WWII infantry tactics, using a rulebook a mere 16 pages long!

Amazing game - but extremely high barriers to entry.  Start with Starter Kit #1.  I don't think I would ever have gotten into it if I didn't know an ASL grognard who could help teach me the ropes.

The starter kits offer enough of the fun without the over the top detail - BUT - the full ASL rulebook is so much better INDEXED that we moved to ASL simply because it was easier to find a rule when a question came up in full ASL than in Starter Kit #3

If you take too much time off from playing its a bit hard to get started again.

One of my favorite games.  The depth and gameplay never fail to deliver.  Even if you play something wrong or miss a rule, it doesn't matter, its still amazingly fun (and you'll probably never realize you missed it).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The price of entry is indeed high, but there's such a wealth of material available for the system, that it's probably worth it.  The Starter Kits might be a good way to go, but I had trouble learning the rules even from those.  Perhaps the best way to get started is with the regular Squad Leader game itself.  Also, while it is very complex (potentially), it's not nearly as long as many of the wargames out there.  Certainly many of the scenarios are playable in an evening.  That's a huge plus for a wargame.  Fun!

so I now have ASL Starter #1, this and beyond valor, the question is now will I ever get my friends to try to play this with me.

Update: 11/29/09, So I have played the starter kit scenarios a few times with some friends, but I have a new, more important question to ask, when are you all finally going to print a Rule Book? I am convinced that the "R" in ASLRB stands for reference, as such a monstrously thick and unreadable tomb does little to actually teach someone the rules of the game. I like what little I know how to play, but really really REALLY wish that they would allow someone to redo the rules to read in a more friendly style (and no Abbreviations!), also if they could put the standard optional rules (cavalry, skis, bridges, task checks and others) in a section by itself that, too would be great. Also there is no rule that you are not allowed to repeat yourself if necessary, my main beef is with part B, why not have all of the movement points, concealment effects, et al. in with the description of the terrain, paper is still fairly cheap. While I am talking of printing, isn't it time to switch to an RPG style binding, it isn't 1985 anymore the rules are stable and have been for over a decade so the need for the binder is not their anymore.

Wow, I guess I do have a big beef with the rules, but the game itself still makes up for it, every scenario I have played was able to tell a story as our little cardboard heroes marched (or in some cases ran) across the field of battle.

This is THE grognard's game, bar-none. The rules complexity is minimized unless you go full-out. It was a game I hated to play, but enjoyed while playing. Definately NOT rules lite! Makes Catan, RftG, and Pandemic look like tic-tac-toe variants (naughts and crosses).

Compared to other wargames though, this is probably the only one you'll ever need or ever want.

I like other games, but ASL i will always play and i can't see that changing.  Each scenario is like it's own unique game, presenting a different puzzle each time.  

No other game can give me fits of anguish like this - a well crafted scenario will have you pulling your hair out trying to 'solve' it.  Fate and fortune can swing wildly making it seem like ... your in a war.  In spite of this the better players (not rules lawyers) most always prevail, making it for sure a game of skill.

Highly recommended!

ASL is [u]the best wargame[/u] based on WWII squad level and the most realistic wargame ever designed. It is a game of manoeuvre. It is a monster rulebook, very complex but it rewards with deep experiences. I still prefer the streamlined ASLSK rules.
It needs the "Beyond Valor" (ASL Module 1).

World War II done right.  The game, although a beast to learn, and a beast to maintain, is just great.  The simulates war well but does not leave a game behind.

Simply the best! Official, third party and upcoming product the list goes on and on. As a game system it has to rate a 10; however you rarely find any ASL on trademe and it is expensive to import - best to accept that you will never play the lot and make the most of what you can get.

Avalon Hill.  Really good squad level war game.  This game has traditionally had its own following of dedicated gamers over the years.  Lots of scenarios.  Good expansions.  Lots of battles can be created.  This is a highly realistic war board game for close combat in World War II.

Like chess, or a master's degree, you must dedicate yourself to mastering it.  Rated a notch below the ASLSKs since they are more approachable and may be a sweet spot in complexity for me.  I do like some of the added rules in full ASL however. This system feels like the holy grail of retro tactical squad based combat. Charts, dice, and indexed rulebook nirvana.

This is my favourite.  Why?
Well,it is a good simulation game (ok, you can keep on discussing if a boardgame can ever simulate warfare, but you can't argue with the fact that it simulates almost all the weapon systems used in WOII and you can refight any type of tactical combat from this war).
Furthermore it is an in-depth game, but one wich stays very enjoyable and fun to play.
You never run out of scenario's, you need a lifetime to play them all.
And, last, but not least, it has a supporting community which keep ASL alive and using VASL you can always find opponents to play.
Only downside is that it do requires some effort to get into the rules, but this time investement rewards you for the rest of your life!

Most who have tried it either love it or hate it; I find it an excellent game but not so excellent simulation.  The biggest downside to the game is the immense learning curve; it is definitely a lifestyle game which will crowd other games out due to time requirements.  Still, the most intense and enjoyable experience I have had in wargames has been through ASL.Recommended to everyone to try at least once or twice.  It may not be your cup of tea, but there is a reason for its enduring popularity.

The Game. Anyone interested in WWII tactical games must (it's a law!) play this system at least a few times. Very doable - an all infantry, company vs. company fight, can be completed in a couple of hours. 

The rules are renowned for being imposing, and that's completely true if one wants to master the entire system. And as it should be, considering it covers everything from an opposed beach landing in the South Pacific to the streets of Stalingrad, from the hedgerow grind in Normandy to the deserts of North Africa. If it's ground combat in WWII you can recreate it using the ASL system. Any system that covers so much so well will be imposing.

But often overlooked is the simplicity of infantry combat when all else is stripped away. Straight forward, but with great depth, ASL is worth getting into just for that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Solid tactical game with interesting twists along the way. Tactical level games typically don't do much for me though. Takes too long for what it is. By trying to cover every possibility it can collapse under its own weight. Lighter scenarios are the ones worth playing in my opinion.

Hard to rate--I didn't dislike it but have no interest in playing it again. Simply way too complex to approach as anything but a lifestyle game.

I think this might be THE game.  Edit: This is THE game.  One year into it and it still fully has my attention.  I learn new things everytime I play.  Ordinarily I would be frustrated by the fact that rules are played wrong in every game of this that I have played, but it really doesn't bother me.  THis game is capable of creating a narrative that unfolds during play like no other non-RPG game.  At any given time I have one or two VASL games going on.  I'm also in an ASL club that meets once a month.  I drive three hours (one-way) to attend these meetings.  I can think of no other game that I would do that for.

The fanbase is quite devoted, in a very good way.  ASL players are the nicest games that I have ever met.

There is a ton of material for this game system, by MMP as well as numerous third party publishers.

Edit:  This WAS the game.  It is a harsh mistress thatyou probably need to devote all of your gaming time too in order to fully appreciate.  My gaming pendulum has swung in other directions, and I have actually turned down a game or two.  That being said, at some point I'll probably get back "in the zone" and play lots of ASL.

The most detailed look at WW2 action ever created: to create a lot of detail requires a lot of rules to represent the minutia of a war that had more various ordinance than any war before or since.

I liked some of the improvements over the original Squad Leader and its far better than the mess that the original series became with CoD & GI:AoV. But I found it all became too much as ASL tried to simulate every little aspect of combat. In the end, its become an over detailed "design for cause" system rather than the streamlined "design for effect" of the original.

Outstanding game - which has the potential to take away all your free time (day and night) as well as a significant portion of your gaming budget. Considering the time it takes to properly play it, I sometime tell myself that I should just dump it and concentrate on lighter games (which I also play) but, guess what, I keep falling in love with ASL. Actually, I started playing it 20 years ago when I was a student and had all the time in the world. I'm not quite sure I would be willing to invest so much time now if I had to do it again. Still, an excellent game (not so much a good simulation).

RATING: 10
Most complete tactical level wargame/sim ever created - I do sometimes feel the SL/ASL series hit it's peak at around 'Cross of Iron' complexity levels in terms of 'fun', however to add all of the elements that the fan base wanted and still keep it cohesive probably required the move to ASL.

I bought all of the modules up to Doomed Battalions in the game's AH iteration, and played the game frequently back in the late 80's, but then it sat on the shelves for over 15 years through lack of opponents. 

With the gaming resurgence of the noughties I picked up and played both Combat Commander and Conflict of Heroes, and though they were both quite good fun, they are both wanting in comparison to ASL. I have now managed to corrupt a couple of other gamers to the dark side (via the starter kits) and ASL is back on the table and is as good as ever.

I disagree with those who say that ASL is a lifestyle game requiring total commitment to it - it does need a fairly intense initial investment in time to get up to speed but after that you only need to play occasionally to keep your hand in, unless you are wanting to play at tournaments, which doesn't really interest me. 

ASL remains the best and most comprehensive way to recreate tactical WWII combat on your table top - it's every war movie you've ever watched in a box - well OK, several boxes.

I remember playing this with a friend a few years ago who raved about it. I have never spent a more tedious day in my entire life, flicking through a rulebook, shuffling a single chit a short distance forwards, and then flicking through the rules for another hour to decide if that unit has forgotten to tie its bootlaces and remembers to use their 'indoor voices.'

Abstraction is clearly not considered here, nor user-friendly interfaces. Perhaps this style of thing kept people entertained in the '80s when there was less on TV and computers were slow, but in today's post-Combat Mission 1+2+3 world, I have no idea why anyone would still play this. Tedious, overblown, duller than a fashion show for the colour brown, interminable references to ludicrously obscure rules - this might just be the least enjoyable game I've ever played and remember, I've played Game of Life.

After nearly 10 hours of play we had exchanged fire a handful of times, two Shermans were on fire, an entire cricket match had been started, played and decided on the TV (Cricket!), my beard had grown to brush the table and a pension book arrived for my friend. I actually couldn't be bothered to call in my (apparently extensive and game-changing?) arty support, I just wanted the whole miserable experience to end. When I suggested maybe going and, you know, doing something 'fun,' my friend just looked at me blankly and said "But this is fun?"

My friend isn't a friend anymore. Coincidence?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fantastic game even if it is a bid fiddly at times (yeah I know, the understatement of the year). 

It's actually much easier to learn and play than many people seem to think. There is this huge rulebook, but you only need to know a fraction of it by heart to play most scenarios. I know several so called easier games I have more problems wrapping my head around. 

Be sure to try out the Starter Kits if you are interested in this game. A good (and cheap) introduction to the game.

Finally, you don't need every single module published to enjoy this game whatever people say. The rulebook + Beyond Valor is enough for starters (really) and after that you can buy Yanks if you want some action on the Western Front too.

RATING: 7
World War II squad level wargame, played in scenario format on generic maps.  A huge game system, almost impossible to rate in a few short sentences.  Complex, interactive, heavy on die rolling and rules, yet suprisingly fluid to play once you crack the crusty exterior.  A players turn roughly follows rally, prep fire, movement, defensive fire, advance, routs, close combat.  Each of these phases of play gives the player an almost infinite combination of options.  Still learning the system (pretty much have chapter A down), just starting to appreciate tactics, and my rating of 7 reflects where I'm at with it.

I've been playing ASL right from Day 1 ... when Avalon Hill released it in 1985.  Granted, it took me a few years to get in the full swing, but by 1988 I was converted.  The game is not for the weak at heart, and is for those that like detailed rules.  Fortunately, I fit that bill.

Some time ago, myself and a friend went through a rather extended process of learning how to play ASL. This was a slow process of going through Scenarios, with the Rules on our laps, trying to make sense of it all. 
My Rating of this game is more a reflection on how much I thought my time was wasted during that period, as I find the game overly complex for performing the task it does. I suppose I learnt enough about it to know that I do not have the concentration span to master, nay, even become proficient in this game; it would require that I give up too much to bend all my efforts in the attempt. That's not to say that I may not find myself drawn, in the future, to a desire to play it again. But, as my rules are somewhat out of date, I would be required to perform something of a largish update to play. Or at least pick up one of the newer Starter Kits, & see  what happens. However, at this time, I don't see it happening.

The all time champion of low level combat in WWII.  Although the rules look daunting, the core principles are straight forward and game play 'simple' with the perceived complexity coming from the pages of cases and exceptions for all different terrain, weather, weapon etc types; in practice you only need read these sections if you are looking to use those elements.  Does, however, benefit new comers to either play with a veteran or buy the starter kits.

RATING: 7
After playing a number of tactical wargames, there are 4 things that stand out as being required for me:

- Morale. At the tactical level, units simply do not constantly eliminate each other. They take cover, they run, they refuse to fight. You can order them to charge the heavy machine gun, but you can't force them to commit suicide.

- Defensive Fire. Over the course of a full turn, every unit gets to take its move/fire actions AND fire at enemy units, during and after movement. Many games make defensive fire more costly than any other action, and basically require the unit to give up everything for the possibility of a future shot.

- Choice. If I want a unit to fire because it's obvious/necessary, but it cannot because I don't have a Fire Attack card, then I am not playing a wargame. A deck of all possible wargame concepts DOES NOT simulate the chaos of war. If you want to simulate command problems, broken radios, or a general lack of information being available to every unit, then build that specifically into the game.

- Playable. Many people fear or criticize ASL because it has a reputation for being really complicated and full of chrome. That may be true, but I can teach and play an infantry scenario (granted, SK) to a wargame newbie in an evening. That says a lot about the system. You only need to know the rules for the parts of the system you are playing, and you can add new stuff as you go.

Excellent engagement of tactical elements of combat in WWII. Yes there are a lot of status counters...a lot...but the play practically tells a memorable story of combat better than other systems.

I've only played ASL Starter Kit, and that's probably where I'll stay. I purchased a ton of ASL stuff over the years, but it was just too hard to get to the table. I finally had to admit that I'm just a casual ASL player, and sold all my stuff -- except for the excellent Starter Kit!

Am dipping my toe into ASL through the starter kits. I am far too busy to have the opportunity to get into full fat ASL at present, but the rulebook and modules are compelling. I have managed to pick most of them up on eBay for very little money. I completely understand the fascination & obsession with ASL - I might be able to get into it in the future, but I don't have enough time at present.

A simply great game. Insanely complex to learn, but absolutely compelling to play. The "gestalt" of ASL is virtually without equal. 
Not for everyone but unequaled in scope and nuance. Many "over the top" rules but they are not used in many scenarios, so it's fairly easy to pick and choose the situations that appeal to one's preferences.
The worldwide ASL playing community is terrific, as well.

Fabulous game, with a tremendous wealth of detail.  While it's complicated, once you learn the system you don't need to reference the rules very often.  Red Barricades (one of the ASL modules) is the ultimate wargame experience.  My only complaint about the game is that its current custodians (Multi-Man Publishing) have the worst customer service of any company I've dealt with...not just any game company, but any company, period.  :-(  Not that the guys there are bad people, they're not - they just don't know how to run a business.

If &quot;advanced&quot; means complex and unplayable, then yes, I agree. I didn&#039;t much care for the original &quot;Squad Leader&quot; but at least it was a game that I could play without dedicating my life to it. Also, the orignal game was designed by John Hill, yet he was cut out of the royalities for the &quot;advanced&#039; version, which always struck me as wrong.

While not for everyone, ASL is perhaps one of a very few games that never seems to get old or to be a passing fad; it's maintained a consistent, hard-core, and large following for the past quarter century and shows no sign of slowing down.  New products keep coming out for this game at a steady rate.  

The success of this system is not only its versatility and depth of detail, it's more than anything on the narrative it creates when playing, especially when using the Historical ASL modules that use historical terrain treatments.  ASL players remember and tell stories much like D&D/AD&D players do.

But it is supported, you can always find an opponent in the active community.  The vast majority of that community is helpful to other people.  If is not your thing its not your thing.  I am sure the game you enjoy is worthy also.  But if it is your thing -  Awesome.

RATING: 10
A comprehensive tactical WW2 system.  Incredible depth, great interaction, AND amazingly playable.  Once you come to terms with it, the rulebook is the best wargame rulebook ever written.  Probably the most ambitious wargame ever designed, and executed brilliantly.  Add superlatives of your choosing in the space provided...

Hard to get into nowadays, due to the lack of availability of the core modules.  Apparently there are good reasons why MMP cannot keep everything (or hardly anything) in print, but regardless it is a shame because the game will die without new blood, and new players cannot be expected to wait decades plus and/or pay huge prices on ebay to get the core modules.  I think that most players simply won't do that.  They will just stick with the SKs, or choose a different system like Combat Commander.  I don't have the answers, but I do feel for the new player that wants to get into ASL but understandably decides it's not practical.  I have friends that fit that description.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A very old game with an old game system that can not compete with late WW2 Squad Level Games.
An heavy and absurdly detailed rules set that could be also interesting for enthusiast reader but are often with no-sense in Game Turn term. (Turret pivoting speed for example: a Tiger turret was able to pivot 180° in 30 secs. , so it's a real no-sense to "penalize" its ToHit value in a 2 minutes game turn!!) 

I read many enthusiatic comments about realism of ASL but i would really understand how can be realistic a squad tactical simulation where (and for example) there is no "Command/Control Chain" and you can move all your units at same time (even hundreds meters apart!) and without any possible enemy reaction in movement terms (and this is not the only example can be pointed out).

That's the limit of ASL no-impulse turn based game mecahnics... and any other consideration about its so much lauded realism and historical detail is made useless by its unrealistic base mecahnics.

Of course, as any other similar Squad level games, ASL is an abstraction of reality and ASL offers its own way to model the reality, it is not the best nor the worst: it's only one way among the other games ones.
I gave "5" for disillusion about a game that, despite its celebrity, i simply consider just a good (but not the best) game.

I see it just a WW2 Squad Level game precursor (and i can understand romantic devotion to it by many BGG users) but nowadays it is fully outdated by more valid and amusing tactical games.

First having rated this a 6.5 due to rules complexity, I've gotten back into the game via Starter Kit #1. Boy, am I glad I did! It's a great game, but I still think there are about 25% more rules than needed. Another way to say it might be, if there were 25% fewer rules the game would be as good, maybe better. Still, I love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
 The ASL system and rule book are fantastic and fun.  I'm just starting out in the system but I love the depth and options.  I like how you can play short scenarios and pick the level of complexity.  I enjoy games where I can study, learn and read for fun and ASL gives you a ton of stuff to grow into.  I can't imagine who ever sat down and figured all this out.  I think the older Avalon Hill games really did their homework on the weapons and details of WW2.  This is the ultimate 'sandbox' system for doing anything tactical in WW2.  It's a huge, open system.  It's the best dice system I've ever played, with two six sided dice (one colored) you get a fantastic amount of action and a huge variety of results. When learning be sure to look at the play examples on the Geek by richfam.  All are excellent. 

 
The ASL system, with all its data and research, is really quite and achievement.  It's detail may be an overkill to some but you have to admire the attempt by the folks at Avalon Hill to flesh out all aspects of WWII combat in one tactical system.  A huge amount of time and ink have been poured into this game.  Modern tactical wargames always seem to me like they cherry pick elements and concepts from ASL and try to repackage them into a smaller game.  Why not go to the source?

A game with as much depth and time required as many college-level courses, Advanced Squad Leader is not for the faint of heart or "casual" wargamer.  Requiring hours of time for even the most basic scenario, the sheer weight of the rulebook is equal to some great tome.  Its a great game, no doubt, but if you want a more accessible game, I recomend the original 1977 Squad Leader.

For me ASL was a step backwards from original SL.

It's now jsut too bloated... sure for years I bought a lot of expansions, read a lot of rules, organised a lot of counters... drooled of maps and scenarios but actually played very little.

Counters are no better now than they were 30 odd years ago. A lot of the boards are ugly and there is little consistancy in colour use (those gawd-awfull dark reddish brown contours on some of them make me shudder)

If this was published now compared to what else is in the market it wouldn't gat a foothold.

Respect what the game system did for board wargames but will never play it again and would sell the collection if I wasn't so lazy.

RATING: 5
Takes an excellent mid 70's game and attempts to fix its mismatch of IGO UGO mechanics to the chaotic reality of tactical combat by a absurdly complex set of phases. To me a tactical game should reflect the direct action of a commander. At most this would mean a company game should be represented by squads and a battalion game should have platoons. Regimental games should have companies as units but can be manageable with platoons. ASL has Regimental operations conducted with squad and weapons teams and single tanks. This has the player operating as one Col. and his staff, 3 or 4 Lt. Col.s and their staffs, and around 20 Captains and their execs and around a 100 Lt.s and their sergeants. Admittedly the game is often only Battalion level but that still has you making the decisions for about 20 to 30 officers. An officers order really only directly impact 2 or 3 levels of organization below which would be 5 to 15 officers. Add to that exaggeration of the almost cartoonish national characters in the original system and you have a bad game. An interesting and occasionally fun bad game.

ASL is a dice game with a WW II component - sort of like craps with tanks.  I've played versions of Squad Leader since 1977, when it first came out.

What makes ASL so wonderful is that each scenario you play creates its own narrative.  It's like making a war movie with cardboard.

Nothing touches ASL for theme, game play and replayability.  It's so challenging and immersive that many folks play nothing but ASL - it is that rich and varied.

I do not like the way game plays at a mass scale, so I don't like the historical modules.  ASL plays best with a company or two of infantry/vehicles per side on a map less than a 1/2 mile square.  In the case of ASL, bigger is not better.

I love this game's ambition, but (I keep telling myself) I haven't the time for a lifestyle game.  That doesn't stop me from dropping money on the game though. What can I say... I'm a sucker. Still, this is one game system that doesn't depreciate in value.

- MMP just can't keep the game in print. Seriously, where the heck is Yanks? 
- They still adhere to an antiquated method of packaging the game, making it completely inaccessible to new players. 
- ASL SK is admirable and goes a long way to introduce newbs... but will this become the Basic D&D to ASL's AD&D, i.e. two separate systems?

All of that said, the legacy this game brings to the table is staggering.  I really appreciate the historical notes in particular.  There will always be a place for ASL.

THE all-time great wargame. I wish I played it more, but the problem is that playing ASL seems to crowd out the playing of all other games (particularly wargames). After several years away from the game I recently managed to duck in multiple sessions, and I find ASL just as fresh, challenging, and entertaining as ever (but maybe just a triffle long). You frankly have to be half-mad to take on this rulebook but the view from the mountaintop is spectacular. When you've broken the back of the system, ASL is as good as wargaming gets.

I have rated this an "8" only because I know it probably deserves a 10 for all the pleasure it brings to its adherents, but it has brought me nothing but grief and pain trying to understand it.  I still enjoy the original Squad Leader, which is closer to Candyland in complexity than to ASL.  Still, I bring this one off the shelf every once in a while to try to dig through the rules, and one of these days I might understand it well enough to play.

Great idea, with gamettes that concentrate on a certain campaign/nationality, but not unlike World In Flames et al, taken WAY too far.  Games became more like lawyers debating points of law than anything resembling a tactical engagement:  "you can't do that."  "Yes I can, look at 45.6793."  "Well you don't have the latest update, that rule was replaced by 47.4591d."  Yeah lots of fun.  
Also have some, well a lot of reservations about weapons "breakage/stoppage" and vehicle breakdowns in a game that is supposedly at 50m-100m/hex and several minutes in time.  Makes more sense to assume that these weapons/vehicles didn't make to the fight, and avoid the dice rolling.  For a game that supposedly has all this research behind it, using a 6 SIDED die to resolve probability?  Nope.

RATING: 3
Played the holy crap out of this game in college (years ago...)  Long since came to the conclusion that 'this' is what happens when a very good game system is brought to its knees by (quite simply) too many rules.  I am a mini gamer and I used to play ASL for twenty years.  I not only can deal with detail, I like detail 'when it is needed' and when it adds to the game.  ASL crossed the line over and over again...  Stick with the original "Squad Leader" and its couple of first expansions ("Cross of Iron" required for veh rules) or go for ATS.

From this game system I got rid of. I had each and every module, all boards, all historical modules. Even the solitaire module. Everybody says it is a lifestyle. My preferred lifestyle is another one. So I no more play this game. I got tired of constantly reading rules and erratas.

Deserves its reputation for complexity and huge amounts of chrome, but the game is fun and rewards planning. There are cases where die rolls will determine your fate but that's the way this sort of game goes. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The learning cureve is steep, but if you have somone to teach you, you will have fun all the way.

ASL successfully mixes a lot of luck (die rolls may destroy your tank or leve it completely untouched) with a game system in which players can use skill, a lot of it, all the time. Thus you get both the drama of the die and the satisfaction of (usually, but not always) winning because you make the best decisions.

RATING: 2
It is the most complex tactical wargame there is & there probably ever will be. And if you don't mind (or actually happily looking forward to) reading 100 pages of rules, then this might be something you should look into.. but imho it has been surpassed by .. well by what actually?
Let's say there are much easier titles, and each has it's own shortfalls.. like CoH Conflict of Heroes, Band of Brothers & others.
ASL is using 6 different Phases to create the feel of simultaneousness.. but does only create complexity for complexity sake..

so for example in ASL you can move your units let's say around the enemy, while the enemy has no opportunity to move (they can shoot, but cannot move..). At least in CoH you could simply retreat your unit.

Also ASL knows no real hidden units, yeah you put questionmarks on counters but you still know where the counter is.. while in some other Tactical & block wargames you have no idea where the unit is..! These two things get me way more into the war-theme than to roll 6 dice to find out that the weather is not changing..

Advanced Squad Leader, what a complex game!! If you want learn the game by reading the rulebook, you won't easy got it, however when meet a rules question during play, you just located the key words in index, then find out the related rules, you must have the answer. This is what the developer designed the useage of rulebook. So this is what make ASL hard to learn.

Personally, I don't like to play any ASL short scenario...why? think about when the OoB give you a OBA for a purpose, however your radio contact die roll is a 12, and later on, the repair die roll on the radio is a 6.......the above is the experience of my Hill 621 scenario :P

However Historical ASL modules is a different story, with historical maps, you leading 1 company of Storm troops and 3 companies of 1st line troops (1 battalion) of soldiers, OBAs, Stuka, tanks. Storming the stone buildings in Stalingard Red Barricade Factories. The intentsived fighting is the most exciting game experiences.

Strategically plan how to occupy all the map hexes within 30 days. Between day and day fightings plan on buying what kind of units for the next day, do you need some assault engineers? Do you need a tank platoon for a armour assault? or using a 150mm OBA to clear the strong defend location of Russian? You have the resources to buy what you want, not like short scenario the OoB give what you have.

Tactically using combined-arms-tactic to force the enemy to given the ground. Place DC to the enemy strong point, place smoke for better hindrance, Squads moved with tanks for a armour assault, Kindling the location is best to avoid enemy using it for fire tower.

With tons supporting materials (hundreds of scenario and many short historical campaign released by other companies) This is the bestest wargame on the earth.

Too heavy without OVERALL effect. They (Greenwood & co.) piled up so many details on the basic system intended for good abstraction (and still lacking command & control).

Many intelligent people have embarked on learning this game and decided against the pursuit. This, coupled with needing bifocals and tweezers to play it, begs a peak at the emporer's new clothes. Retro rules are fully attired, however.

The premier tactical WW2 game.  ASL is not a fling, but a committed relationship.  You get out of it what you put into it.  It can have a steep learning curve, but therein is the payback.  Seeing your game play improve as the mechanics and concepts come together can be thrilling.  Mastering the tactics and tricks is a ongoing pursuit like no other in gaming where "Do you remember when..." stories are regaled among ASL comrades years after.  One of the most integrated and functional rules set ever produced.  For as much as it tackles, it delivers.  ASL is not for everybody, and that is okay.  Though, for those who try it and embrace it, it is an experience like no other.

The one and only Tactical WWII classic. This game is a tough love, there are many things which annoy me including that you can't use the LOS string unless you commit to fire, the mountains of expansions which build on each other, non historic scenarios and modular boards, but despite these small problems I think ASL is a classic and important game system. While at the time of writing I have yet to play ATS (its nearest competitor), it is a truly wonderful and engrossing system. I feel the full game does add something over the starter kits, but the starter kits are excellent as well. In many ways the involvement ASL requires is like a miniatures game, study the rules, acquire modules and play.

If I were to expand on my ASL experience I think I would want to play stuff on a larger scale or with a more historical bent. There is much elegance in this system, under the mountains of chrome and I heartily recommend every one to try it, at least in its starter kit persona. It is a testament to the design that it still offers a better tactical game than many of its newer, prettier rivals.

A great game system. Hugely complex, yet about as complicated as you choose to make it. It's actually not too bad if you just deal with the infantry rules, but then if you don't get too far into the system, what's the point? Original Squad Leader is easier to manage if you prefer to not live the ASL lifestyle.


 Incredibly flexible. I completely understand why so many people like this game, and what the fuss is about. The thing is, I never did get into it all that much as I prefer strategic-level games. It does really require a fair bit of time to get the most out of it. It can easily be a hobby in itself, and my gaming interests are a bit too varied to concentrate on a single game system. 

Had fun with it during my ASL-phase 1988-1991. If I need a squad-level tactical game fix, I actually prefer SSI's Steel Panthers series (I know, it's a PC game, not a boardgame) as I can get a similar effect without investing oodles of time.

RATING: 10
I've been playing this game for over 25 years.  I have a very large ASL collection which I do not track in this BGG profile.

ASL is a challenging, but very rewarding game to play.  The game has an outstanding ebb and flow feeling, and it is very frequently difficult to know whether you will win or lose until the end of the scenario. Consequently, the game is always intense. The phase structure of the turns mean that both players are always doing something, which means NO downtime between turns.  

You can try this game system very inexpensively with the ASL Starter Kits now available through Multiman Publishing.  Some people are happy to play just the starter kits, and others go on to explore the entire system.  No other game has the same replayability. If you own the complete system, you can play every major and minor participant in the war, and fight on any front. If a vehicle, weapon, or troop existed in WWII, you can probably find it somewhere in a module or expansion.

Each nationality has a different feel when played (is any of this realistic, probably not, but I don't care.... it is just a great game). The game is also very flexible. There are a large number of geomorphic boards (more than 60) that can be placed together to make custom maps. In addition, there are a very large number of historical maps based on research of the actual terrain on which the battles were fought. Play time can range from an hour for small scenarios up to 100 or more hours for large campaign games. There are many hundreds of published scenarios available, and some are free for downloading from the web.  In addition there are rules for solitaire play, email and postal play, online game play through Virtual Advanced Squad Leader (VASL), and design your own games called DYO that allow you to quickly pick out opponents purchase your forces and set up maps and objectives. There is a thriving community of dedicated players who produce scenarios and historical modules for this game. In addition there are expansions for the system covering the Spanish civil war, the Italian invasion of Ethiopia and other non-WWII battles. There is a large body of information about the game including FAQ’s and mailing lists to assist players with game play and rules interpretations.  Other players are fairly easy to find via the Internet, and most major metropolitan areas will have an active group of ASL players.  The game requires a high level of skill to play well, but there is enough luck that, like real life, surprising things happen and you must adapt. I play a lot of different games and I rate a few quite highly, but if I had to pick only one game to play, this is the one I would choose.

RATING: 8
Fantastic game with unlimited replay potential. In some ways, it's really more a hobby in itself than a part of the general gaming hobby. Keeping up with the rules to ASL is a demanding mistress.

As a simulation the game leaves a lot to be desired, mainly since players have much too much control over their forces and knowledge of the situation. It is also immensely detailed and complex and to me, many of the rule mechanisms feel unnecessarily complex and unwieldy for what they do.

Still, the level of detail, and the thousands of scenarios makes this game more replayable than almost every other game. For players with a strong interest in WW2, who aren't afraid to sell their 'gaming soul' to this, ASL promises a lifetime of enjoyment.

RATING: 10
From a reference and competitive play point of view, the game has one of the best written and most comprehensive sets of rules ever written.  There is a steep learning curve associated with learning the game, but the release of the ASL Starter Kits has provided a fresh new route to surmount it and more importantly once the learning curve is surmounted the intuitive nature of many of the game mechanics aid retention.  Also, once that learning curve is surmounted, the door is wide open to gaming virtually any squad/vehicle-level tactical engagement of WWII.

Game play paints a very vivid and exciting narrative that "feels" real despite the use of representative terrain and forces as well as a lack of command and control rules.  The size of the player base for this game, the number of of tournaments across the globe, the number of scenarios available, the continued production of both official and third-party provider material and the time that has past since the game's initial publication are all testaments of why this wargame is a 10.

A bit of a shocker to this long-time fan of this seminal game; for all its flaws - however many you might admit them to be, or howsoever you might agree to define them - ASL gave us hardcore Squaddie fans what we wanted- absolutely EVERYTHING, in exhaustive detail.

In its heyday there really was NO COMPETITION, and I've played it more than anything else except RPGs, bridge, backgammon, [i]Up Front[/i], [i]Space Hulk[/i], [i]Memoir'44[/i] and [i]Combat Commander[/i]. Nowadays the limitations of ASL's elderly IGO/UGO turn structure are only too evident. My newest copy of these rules has just gathered dust for some 5 or more years, and I suspect it's just a nostalgia piece. ;)

I have been playing other games here of late, but ASL will always have a welcome place in my collection. Easily the king of tactical simulation. Don't believe the hype about complexity. Very fluid play with many rules for special situations. Don't want to worry about Gun Duels? Don't use the rule. Anything you can contrive on a tactical level is made possible here. Just fantastic. I'm a litle surprised command control wasn't kept from the original Squad Leader (GI Anvil of Victory), but I'm sure there was a good reason why it was deleted.

There is an excellant game, system  but hampered by a  rule book that is actually not a rule book but a MilSpec like index. Happily thanks to the ASLSK, we can learn how to play competantly with ease. The game can sometimes be overwhelming, too  fiddly, with extra details, but it provides some excellant insights into WWII small unit infantry tactics. While it has tanks, the game is best at reflecting infantry combat. I enjoy the smaller, simpler scenarios that don't need many special rules ...these are blast to play

I struggle to like this. I should like it. I like war games. I am a casual WW2 history buff and can bore at length on a variety of WW2 topics. ASL fails to hit the mark with me. It always feels like some weird abstract exercise with a WW2 thrown in its general direction. I find the mechanics clunky and restrictive, and ironically the random results whilst fairly tightly constrained can spell complete victory or complete disaster on a bad day.

I love the completeness that ASL and its almost infinite add ons bring - but for me its clunky abstractions and its molasses move and fire mechanics spoil what should be the king of the hill.

Occasionally I hear an ASL enthusiast proclaim the game to be the most accurate boardgame depiction of WWII tactical combat.  That's nonsense.  It is a terrific, highly involved game depicting WWII combat, but falls short as a simulation on several counts.  That doesn't bother me in the slightest - it remains a challenging game, with useful abstractions and design compromises made where necessary to enhance playability.  Yes, it's incredibly complex, but for what it is, the rules are incredibly tight and the system is highly intuitive.  Not for everyone, to be sure, but I've knocked out over 500 games all over the globe, and I'm always ready for more.  It's opened friendships, sparked conversations, led me to explore other elements of the boardgaming hobby, and in the end, has been well worth the time and money I've invested in the system over the years.  Two thumbs up.

I played a lot of the original Squad Leader, but it took many years before I took the plunge and purchased ASL.  It's the ASLSKs that actually got me looking at ASL.  Have I read all the rules?  No way!  Truth be told, I probably play ASL with a subset of the rules equivalent to the SK rules.  It's all I can remember at any given time and the subset may vary depending on the day.

A hobby within a hobby, ASL is kept clapped in irons in a darkened corner of my game room and fed smaller games from time to time. A quantum leap forward for players of SL, obviously, with many, many enhancements and improvements (e.g., the Defensive Fire mechanics, abstracted Snipers) but with a rulebook that could stop a 20mm shell. I find it difficult to rate, as I'm drawn to it but it demands a commitment I cannot make (yet). My long-term goal is to play a SASL campaign with a Canadian infantry company using PLCs... it may happen one day.

I've been hooked on Squad Leader since the beginning.  Yes, I agree that ASL is the ultimate in infantry combat boardgames.  However, it's not the easiest to learn or play.  That is why you see very few "casual" ASL players.  The complexity and detail of the core ruleset has not been rivaled by any other boardgame.  This fact tends to dissuade potential ASL gamers.  For the patient few newcomers, the complexities begin to make sense with the actual playing of the game.  With the assistance of knowledgeable (and patient) fellow players, newbies get the hang of it.  One feature of the game that is most often over-looked is that players in mutual agreement can include or exclude various advanced/optional rules and as desired.  I know of several groups that collectively own most of the Squad Leader, Advanced Squad Leader, and MMP games and modules, yet they play using nothing more than the original Squad Leader and/or Cross of Iron rules!  And that's okay, because they are having fun.  Personally, everytime I think of getting more involved in local historical WWII miniatures games, I become disappointed to find most of those rulesets deficient as compared to ASL.  ASL games, while commonly played as a boardgames, translate nicely to the 4'x8'gaming table, using 1/285 scale or larger miniatures.  Bottom line is that the ASL series of games and modules may be intimidating at first.  But with the actual playing of the game, the rules begin to make sense.  Then, you will agree that this game represents the most accurate boardgame portrayal of WWII infantry combat available.

Rating based on recent play of infantry-only scenario with an experienced player who did the rule look up.

Easing back into this under the guidance of an experienced player.  There are a lot of brain-burning decisions to be made each turn, and the game really moves along.

It's a game that requires a heavy investment of time and is expensive to get into.  However, by easing into it, you can have a lot of fun while learning the game.

I'm not sure if I'll take the full plunge into vehicles and artillery any time soon.  Just the infantry and terrain rules require a lot of time to learn.

My all time favorite game.  But, need to spend years mastering it and reading the >1000 page rule book, over $1000 to buy all the components, and at least 8 hours to play a single match.  Also, need an equally dedicated and available opponent.  However, if all those stars align, this is a great WW2 squad level simulation/game.

One of my favorite sayings:

When I was 12, I played Risk and tried to conquer the world.

When I was 15, I played Diplomacy and hoped to take over Europe.

When I was 20, I played Stratego and desired to win the battlefield.

Now, I play Advanced Squad Leader and am happy to just make it across the street in one piece.

RATING: 10
Suffers from too much command and control (balanced by very important pin and morale results), a rulebook the size of a major city's phonebook, almost too many charts and tables to count, rare but undeniably gamey tactics that can spoil the fun, a high cost of entry and the perceived need to have umpteen modules to cover it all,  graphics that were only average twenty years ago, and the need to play fairly often to keep it all in mind.

Without those faults, I would give it a 12.  It's the only game I know of that I can imagine playing forever.

Wasted far too much of my gaming life on this monstrosity.  With a new wargame, you expect to fumble through the rulebook for the first couple of plays.  But with ASL it never ends -- no matter how long you've played, every game is an exercise in rule-flipping drudgery.  And for what?  It isn't any more "realistic" than the original Squad Leader.  Went cold turkey, sold my complete AH set 10+ years ago, and haven't looked back.

Difficult to learn. Very steep learning curve. It takes years to know how to play this game. Only for those who are interested in history of WWII. It is very detailed. 
Once you understand the rules, it becomes very dangerous to get addicted to this game.
This game never becomes boring. It is always a challenge to prepare the game by learning new rules and a challenge to beat your opponent.  
The better you know the rules, the better the game becomes.   
This wargame is very well supported by his official publisher MMP and by some unofficial publishers. It has a very good helpforum (http://www.gamesquad.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=30).

Too much game and too little play, maybe if I had a few years stuck in a monastary or prison to study these rules.... Other than that once actually played the story told by an ASL game is great and usually memorable.

I won't rate ASL since my number would be low due to the over detailed and far from elegant rules. I think detail has gotten in the way of playability and even realism. To counter that as stated above the narative and experience can be quite fun when played without the full ruleset.

I'm odd amongst ASL fans, though, in that I have very little interest in streetfights in Stalingrad. I did that to death while learning the basic Squad Leader game. Give me some tempting open fields where I can gun down/be gunned down anyday!

Suffers from deadweight of too many years of expansions. Somewhere under the encrusted layers of rules-lawyering, there is a decent game buried (Squad Leader) but its appeal of realistic squad level combat, for me at least, was replaced by better playing and more interesting computer games. Points for completeness, and detail, of course.

Still a good squad-level game, just there are games that I will enjoy more.

I started playing squad leader in 1977, when I was 11 years old.  I bought ASL when it came out, but could not wrap my head around it solo, and there were no opponents within 3 light years.  Last week I played ASL starter kit and remembered how much I loved the Squad Leader system.

ASL is an absolute gem to play.  Most of the scenerios I looked at are small scale single or half board scale, rather than the two or three board games that were all the rage in the early 1980s.  These scenarios look easily playable in a two and a half hour time frame.

The easy comparison is between ASL and the Advanced Tobruk System, which uses an alternating impulse system.  For purely a desert tank game, ATS wins.  Furthermore, the larger hex system in ATS makes the game easier to manipulate if there is a high counter density.  However, in play ASL again, I do not think the alternating implulse system adds anything to the infantry fight, thus ASL wins.

  The Starter Kits make it accessable to get into.  I highly recommend the ASL Starter Kits.  You can not learn the rules by reading the main rule book, that is the game's major flaw.

UPDATE Aug '08: I still feel that ASL is the best wargame ever made.  If I'm ever stranded on a desert island, someone please airdrop this game to me and I'll be happy.  However, I just don't play it much any more.  Again, I still stand by my comment that it is possible to play ASL and other games.  It's just that my "other games" right now include monsters like Case Blue and Devil's Cauldron.  I don't have time for Tiddly Winks, let alone ASL.

Best wargame ever. And not just by a bit - by a long shot. I get surprised when people say things like, "It's a way of life." Or "It's the only game you can ever play if you want to play it." I play lots of other games. In fact, other games seem pretty easy to learn after playing ASL!!

Heaven on earth why people talk about and play this tactical World War 2 game from birth till death and God knows why I would write about this game.

And even more obsecure is why people would be interested in such an extreme complex game (a complexity of 10 out of 10 on the Avalon Hill's own scale is way too low...it should be double that rating).  Realsitic, may be.  But I never get into it.  With tons of pages of rules well bound into a hardcover binder, professional? Yes, Playful? No.  When people say it is actually not that complicated because not all of the rules would be used as the situation warrants in any particular scenario.  Then, what for?  If only the core rules are used for every scenarios and you have to flip through the rest most of the time to play that correct rule when you encounter a situation you haven't seen before...you figure it out.  

Geomorphic mapboards are something too abstract to me and I find it strange to relate these theoratically endless combination of mapboards could have in any sense simulate the histrocial scenarios while fans of ASL claim it as a historical game.

I suspect ASL is "historical" in the WW2 weaponary sense.  Yes, the actual data of all the types of weaponary, armor and infantry, even smoke grenade are all here.  And most people like ASL becuase of the like of weaponary.  But, hell, I am not interested at all to find whether that enemy tank is within my infantry squad sight on terrain made up of geomorphic maps. The maps, actually, made the game more ahistorical than it originally intended.  

Part of my natural instinct, I find it more natural for modern (i.e. after the Great War) warfare at operational and/ or strategic level and pre-modern warfare at more tactical level.  Although this is not a good rule strictly, I never find myself to be "realsitically" in ASL world.  ASL is an oddity to me, even though wonderfully ring-binded.   So, it has a mere rating of 5 on my track, a rating which gives due credit to its sheer amount of military information and enormous efforts in simulating WW2 at a tactical level.     

Still, after the brainwashing of ASLSK, I am beginning to look into this popular tactical level system game.

My collection shows that this game is one of my favorites. A friend once called it "The Queen of Games". I agree with him. It took many tries over the years and the push of the same great friend to finally hook me. I find ASL moves in seasons as you are able to find opponents with the same time, commitment, and play style as you. I'm in a drought now (Nov 2010) but eagerly awaiting the next rainfall. I have wanted to make ASL my one weekly play. It's not the type of game you can play off and on with. It takes practice to keep the skills honed.

My brother-in-law is a tactical war gamer, and a fan of complex and realistic modeling of battle environments.  (He also played Star Fleet Command.)  At its core, this is THE Tactical war game, and the game for which most other tactical war games owe fealty to.  The downside, of course, is the rules upon rules upon rules.  The plus side, the research behind it is mind boggling.  I have respect and admiration for this game, though I can't say that I love it.

This is a great game. I started off playing Squad Leader and moved on to ASL in 1993 or so.  There are a lot of good scenarios to play, but recommend the campaign games. That's where ASL really comes into its own (but they can take a while to play).

Ok, maybe someone will kill me, buut I have found that ASL is one of the worst wargames ever published... Advanced tobruk system is far better and even Panzer Grenadier is nicer and better. TCS is really much more realistic. Why? 

ASL in all is tons of rules has forgot to cover some of the basic tenet of warfare... Command. It's a simple Igo-youg game. While that approach work on bigger scale games at squad level it don't work. Too much reliance in a load of technical data and fiddly rules when that basic aspect is almost ocmpletely forgotten. And many of the scenarios seem too "balanced" for my tastes. They aren't historical they are conceived game wise instead that hostorical wise. War isn't a balanced affair.

ASL is the mainstay of my gaming.  SL was about the fourth or fifth game I owned (after Russian Campaign, Fortress Europa and the African Campaign).  It revolutionised my gaming world and I was hooked immediately (at age 13).  I still remember anxiously awaiting ASL (an experience that was to be repeated with every new module for another twenty years).  And I remember being blown away by the (to my mind) major improvements that it wrought to an already pretty exciting game system.

Although I still compulsively collect and play other games that appeal to me in various ways (interesting historical background is one common theme; ability to play with young children is another), I always come back to ASL.

For a system that has so much depth, the fundamentals of the game are (I think) pretty intuitive.  The game captures the flavour of small unit combat impressively.  And, above all, it is so demanding as a game - not in the sense of rules knowledge (although that helps), but in the sense of having to make decisions and to be creative in doing so.  If the scenario is well balanced (and there are many hundreds if not thousands that are) it is hard to find a more tense, dynamic and exciting gaming experience.

Obviously ASL is not for everyone.  The learning curve can seem pretty steep (although I don't think it is too hard for an experienced gamer to learn ASL), and the subject matter may not be of interest to those who prefer less confronting subject matter than combat.  But as a pure gaming experience, I can't go past this.

One of my first wargames was the original Squad Leader, and ASL was a natural progression for me.  Not my genre of choice, but the game somehow drew me in.  I think it succeeds because it has a roleplaying aspect - ASLers can often be heard swapping "war stories" of unusual occurences in their games!  It also is interactive, in spite of bing IGO-UGO.  As one player moves his units, the other gets to fire at them, so there is no "downtime" for one player as the other moves.

RATING: 7
This isn't a game you can pick up and play easily. Reading the huge rule book may seem intimidating, but once you learn basic rules, you can get a lot of enjoyment from simple infantry scenarios. Tanks, artillery etc. require studying even more rules which make the game even heavier. Right now I am happy with just infantry. The rating may go up in future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
My two highest rated games couldn't be much different.  Cosmic Encounter is whimsical and Advanaced Squad Leader is intricate and yet I appreciate them both.  ASL leaves you feeling drained after every session, it is war in every sense of the word.  I realize the rules are complicated and overwhelming, but for me its worth it.  There is so much to explore and every decision and die roll effects everything else.  I tend to wonder if I had played it more would the rating go down...maybe it would, but for now, I can't wait to sit down and stare at the map again.

THE GAME!

No question about it.  Nothing comes close to equaling it for drama, it is the benchmark for all other games, no matter the theme or system.  The sense of accomplishment and the desire to improve are immediately felt by the player in every scenario.  Each one is a Greek tragedy played out with the high and lows crashing down around the players.  What a rush of adrenaline when the first enemy Tiger brews up, only to be followed by your best leader getting killed as a consequence of the same dice roll.  Talk about balance, life in a bottle my friends.

I have been playing this game since 1976 when it first came out as Squad Leader.  A masterpiece, which has almost infinite replay value.

It is possible to devote yourself to ASL and play other games.  I do it and have found the balance very helpful in improving my appreciation for the Game when I return.

There's a lot of work required to get into this game, both in terms of learning/referencing rules, and finding an opponent with time to play.  If you do get a change, though, do it.  I've never seen its equal.

I don't know if it's realisitic, and I don't care.  What it does is create imaginary battlefields which are vivid, dynamic, and unpredictable.  It's also a game where smart tactics will triumph over sheer firepower.

I have been very deep into this and sold off most of what I had at good value, because I was playing nothing else and most of my friends had moved on.  Lately, I have met some new friends who had never played so I turned them onto ASL (was that a good thing to do?)  Anyway, we have had several great games lately.  I am not going to go nuts this time around.

The fact is that no game of any genre approaches the meticulous detail of ASL.  It's an awesome game and not really as fiddly as it sounds.  Ok, it's a little worse. :-P

Just an amazing system. It IS playable, and surprisingly not terribly difficult at its core if you have a teacher. When you get deeper into the system the details can become overwhelming, but even at its most extreme it is still playable. You will, however, never remember all of the details in the game. I played in a group with veteran players and most nights we would have to do a rules check at least once (the index helps immensely, but sheesh, the rule book is intense). If you put effort into learning the system, however, you will be rewarded like no other gaming experience. Thousands of scenarios, nearly limitless variety, and intense and memorable experiences will draw you back time and again.

Edit: For whatever reason, I was spurred to give this (along with ASLSK) a try again just recently. I think I'm finding I appreciate it more than I thought. A lot of the stuff I hated was really stuff that was introduced in GI: AoV. (to be fair, a lot of that stuff made it to ASL, too) But now I think I have a more nuanced opinion. There is a lot of really good chrome in ASL (e.g., the Heat of Battle and Sniper rules are great, and relatively low overhead), to go along with the really annoying and misplaced chrome. (e.g., Prisoners, Kindling, squads removing machine guns from vehicles etc etc etc....this stuff really has no place in a game at this level...also, stuff like Vehicular Bypass Freeze is just an oversight in the rules, IMO....you get plenty of gamey loopholes that can be sleazed when you include rules for EVERYTHING. Also, if this system was designed nowadays, I'm betting that the Rout rules would be different. A unit being either 'good order' or in 'rout' is just too stark - Pinned status is possible, of course, but it, or 'suppressed' should be the common condition, and the radical 'rout' status should be basically permanently out of action, and rare. Also, while the vehicle rules have some neat aspects, it is also a ton of rules overhead, and adds loads of playtime when you add more than a couple of tanks. That's in addition to the fact that many players use tanks in the most gamey way possible. I personally think these rules should have been streamlined, but I know that's heresy. When the system was being designed, there was a vocal contingent that wanted much MORE detail in the armor/ vehicle rules. Thank god for small blessings, I suppose) Some of the annoying chrome can be ignored, by rules in the game such as No Quarter, or house ruled by mutual consent. So, coming back to this system after many years, I can appreciate what it does well, and especially the breadth of the system if one is willing/ able to afford the cost of entry, and I can look on it more favorably than I once did. People curious or interested in the system should first try one of the Starter Kits. They really aren't too difficult to learn, and there are plenty of learning aids here and elsewhere. Strangely enough, the Starter Kits seem almost *too* simple to me when compared to the full ASL rules, even though they are more complicated then vanilla Squad Leader was, aside from some mild chrome for specific situations that was in the original game.

As an aside, the rulebook is really a wonder. I enjoy just browsing through it, which seems bizarre. I'll see new things in it every time I read it. It's difficult to imagine the amound of labor and care that went into this in the early '80s...it would be a massive job now, with super computers and the internet. The index alone is mind boggling. Great job by Don Greenwood among many others.

Ridiculously overcomplicated. Designer/developer evidently never understood the concept of abstraction. (Well, actually, Don Greenwood did a lot of the developing, and I know he understands this stuff, I just think he lost his mind on ASL) Despite the abundance of rules for *everything* that can possibly occur (rules which will be remembered by nobody,until someone pulls a 'gotcha!' out of the rulebook in order to win the game), this series is frightfully 'unrealistic'. Any semblance to actual tactical combat, which is rife with confusion, is purely coincidental. Instead,units in this game will go about their business with parade ground precision. I bought into this series from its earliest days (I have a purple box copy of SL), but I'd have to say that the very first game is more 'realistic' than ASL, and it's actually playable to boot. This game is a waste. But, for those who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they'll like.

Obviously, a lot of people like ASL, and have played it continuously for many years, so I'm glad it's there for those people. It's not for me, though.

Had most of the system before reluctantly selling it off.  I loved the feel of ASL, especially the scale and the way a battle comes together and evolves over many turns.  Though I do have some serious concerns with one of the main facets of the game, what I really didn't like was the time commitment just to remain somewhat competent.  Practice makes perfect, and without ample practice ASL can seem a lot like work - which is what I do when I'm *not* gaming.  Too much cost for too little benefit in terms of $$, space and time.

RATING: 10
I have both the AH and MMP editions.  This is the definitive wargame.  Despite its terrifying size, the rules aren't all that hard to learn.  The vast majority of the rules are just "what ifs" for certain things and don't need to be mastered.  The chapter H historical notes are incredible and often found themselves in the footnotes of my university essays.  I miss the way that AH managed to keep everything in print at all times for this. There is not a single official ASL product from either manufacturer that I didn't pick-up.  There are, however, many I have never played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Even with the really hard learning curve and some misgivings this is THE squad-level WWII tactical simulation. 

Rule details allows you to do almost everything true squad leaders would have done in the real battlefield.

The vehicle and gun chapters contains more info than many dedicated books I have read.

Infinite replayability,  spectacular detail, huge variety of tactical situations,  from night glider landings to ski troops assaults or tanks raising dust clouds in the desert.  Fight in Poland plains, 1940,  Stalingrad's factories, 1942 Tarawa beaches, 1943, El Agheila sands, 1942, Berlin Reichkanzlerei, 1945 and soon Busan perimeter and hundreds more places

MMP 2nd Edition. Excellent and fun to play. Obviously the level of complexity is very high, and in some ways, too detailed. Scenarios range across the board in terms of quality, interest, balance, and scope, but are generally good. The rules still could use some tightening up (ex. Rule X see Rule Y; Rule Y see Rule X); and while it would make the rules even longer, some repetition and spelling out of acronyms would be useful. With more plays, I find some of the scenarios are unbalanced; I like the ones with cramped settings. Those with a few units spread out over large areas aren't that interesting.I down rated ASL because I find my tastes in tactical wargaming to be changing to those systems that aren't nearly as detailed: Conflict of Heroes and Lock 'n' Load are hitting my table now instead of ASL.

There is an old saying that it's the journey not the destination that's important. For me that's the problem with ASL. The journey is cumbersome, overwrought and filled with chrome for chrome sake. It's just not fun to play because it feels like you're battling the rules more than your opponent.

ASL is the most interesting WW2 tactical game I've played (and I've played a few).  It's not really a historically accurate simulation per se, but it does attempt to produce historical results, and the wealth of detail in the game seems to mirror history enough to produce satisfying engagements that feel like they go the way they should.  Rather than being a historical simulation though I almost see it as a World War 2 movie simulation, full of heroic dudes riding on tanks carrying machine guns or charging across a bullet-swept bridge to seize the objective at the last second.  It makes for some memorable gaming. Infinitely expandable to encompass battles around the world. What more can you ask for?

A deep and nitpicking wargame, heavy as lead; it's a golden standard reference on the topic (tactical WW2). The rules for vehicles are really tough to digest. 
Requires love, time and devotion, but it rewards you with one of the deepest wargaming experience out there: [i]if you can handle it[/i].

Can be fun, can be a pain in the backside.  If you like squad-level combat and lots and lots of "chrome" this is the game for you.  Virtually every action of WW2 can be recreated if you have the entire system (though you will face some difficulty moving it all around when required to do so).  Prepare to spend most of your gaming time figuring it out/memorizing it, or prepare to be frustrated.  The faint of heart need not apply. :)  Many fun modules, especially the Historical ASL (HASL) modules.

One game  system but a lifetime of play if you get hooked on to it. So much out ther in follow up releases (modules) that its overwhelming, but main system is top of the line.  There are a massive numbers of little things to remember not many of which are intuitive.  (If you prefer, you can stick with Starter Kits and enjoy this game a lot. The basic game system is fine.   The devil is in the details, which in this one in its full form is absolutely massive.) Truly immersive, but becomes overwhelming.

RATING: 9
I can only play this with my buddy Fubar. He has been playing this game for 185 years. Every time is quite an experience, but I am daunted by the rules overhead. I can see that if one committed to learning it all, it would be an unparalleled wargaming experience, but I have a family and run two businesses, so these days if I don't have Fubar there to housekeep the rules, it probably won't hit the table.

I feel like a rat for not giving it a 10 (which I am sure it deserves in some cosmic sense) but, alas, I only give it an 8 because I could read War and Peace and re-read Bleak House in the time it takes to absorb the ruleset.

(In all fairness to MMP, the new starter sets really do a fine job of easing one into the rules. And the fact that it has had a cult following all these years attests to its compelling design. If I were 17 years old again, I would want to master it...)

And another thing to say about the rules overhead: it sure seems to reward one for the commitment. It gives back in depth and strategic possibilities what one puts into it. Not all games are as equitable.

Loved Squad Leader, but ASL is more like GI Anvil in being rather over the top. The programmed instruction has gone too, so it's been harder to learn; pretty much impossible without someone who knows the rules.  The Starter Kits have saved the day, being more akin to the original games and the gradual introduction of things like big guns and tanks. ASL was part of the slow death of board-wargames. Yet I still love the sets and the scenarios, the research that's gone into it all.  Actually playing it is another matter.  If you're solitaire you could always play with the Starter Kit rules and tweak the scenarios to suit.  That's my plan...

Learned this on my own, definately not the way to go, you should have someone with some experience teach you how to play this game and then follow up reading the rules as you can.

Love how the game allows you do do basically anything you could conceive of in battle with your units.

This is one of those situations where the complexity really adds to the enjoyment of the game. Plus, with all the rules setting up the ASL system, each scenario is deceptively simple in its writeup. And so long as one has the counters, almost any tactical land scenario can be replayed. It's more like a combat simulation.

Rules. Rules. Some more rules. Chits. Counters. And rules. Oh, and did I mention rules.
At least it simplified all of the misshapen mechanics that were added to the original by all its expansions. Simply put, these were among the heaviest wargames I ever got to play. When I still played wargames, though, I loved them and thought both Squad Leader and ASL were brilliant.

Now, however, I do not have the time to invest in playing long games. Maybe its my Attention-Deficit-Dis- ... ooh, shiny.

Rated a 2 only because I will "never play this again." It's a good game, but an example of a "lifestyle game." You commit to playing this, or you don't play it at all. It's also clearly better in conjunction with a computer. It drags due to all of the calculations players need to make in order to resolve engagements.

The beautiful Company of Heroes PC game satisfies my squad- and platoon-level tactical game itch in a tiny fraction of the time.

I was just introduced to this game system in March, 2016, and became hooked. I had absolutely no background with war-games so the learning curve was more of a learning cliff. It's expensive upfront, no doubt (unless you're going to play strictly online with VASSAL or against face-to-face opponents with their own sets). But if you like the game, the hours you'll get out of it are immeasurable. This summer I've averaged 6-7 hours per week playing online and face-to-face. ASL is so dense no one can master all the rules, which is part of the appeal to me. Always something new to learn and incorporate into play strategies. Unless you're a war-gamer, ASL is probably not a system in which you could just dabble. To play passably will require a lot of time investment in learning rules and, of course, playing (my games average 3-4 hours and I usually lose before reaching the turn limit). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I have a copy of the rules but due to the horrible complexity I won't likely play.  You would really have to play often to get a working knowledge of this game.  Not interested in devoting myself to one game/hobby.  I prefer ATS which has a decent level of complexity but doesn't require quite the devotion. ATS kind of fell by the wayside in terms of support and development so the better bets right now are Conflict of Heroes or Combat Commander (if you don't mind the lack of AFVs).

RATING: 7
This game is a classic, but today its components are considered small and unimpressive, and there are now some games that give close to the same level of realism and are far easier to learn and more enjoyable to play.

Most people I have met either love or hate this game.  To many wargamers, this game is the Holy Grail, the one perfect game, the most realistic wargame ever created. But some questions about its realism have been raised, such as the over-effectiveness of bazookas.  And even most that I have met who play it, will only play with the infantry rules, in order to avoid the tremendous complexity that requires you to spend more time reading rules than playing.

To many nonwargamers this game is the supreme example of the worst game ever made and an example of what not to do in creating a game.  Merely referring to a game as ASL-like is in their minds the worst insult ever.  To them it denotes an unplayable game due to the complexity.

ASL is all wargame and non-wargamers need not apply. It has had a very important part in the development of game systems that are unified and complete, and it allows players to recreate every battle in WWII.  That is a pretty impressive accomplishment.

ASL is neither the best nor the worst game today.  It is a very important step in the development of great games.  The recent development of the Starter Kits and also some excellent tutorials on BGG by Jay Richardson have made the game much more accessible to those trying to learn and enjoy it.

When I first played Squad Leader, I was overwhelmed.  I'd been playing wargames for over a decade, and this was by far the most exciting one I'd ever played.  I bit the complexity bullet and forged ahead.  But the expansions finally made it too complicated to play.  ASL ties it all back together neatly, but there are still an oppressive number of rules.  Ultimately I decided it wasn't worth the hassle, so I sold all my ASL stuff and never looked back.

The ASL rulebook is a monument.  I'm in awe every time I crack it open.

At the same time, I'm put off by a ruleset that wants to add systems for everything at such a cost of weight and fiddliness.  I know most of them aren't used in most scenarios, but the degree of look-up and the dense web of exceptions/clarifications/complications add a burden of rules overhead that puts me off the game.

The system seems just a step away from trying to do more than can reasonably be done with paper.  Approaching that gap, it's easier just to make the leap to the PC Combat Mission series.  While CM falls a few theaters short, it simulates much more and with more granularity while keeping the workload under the hood.  For me the paradox is that ASL simulates too much without simulating enough.

For some this is the game of a lifetime.  My rating indicates huge respect tempered by moderate alienation.

RATING: N/A
A bit of a love/hate relationship with this one. I love it because of its depth and because there are so many scenarios available and it is fairly easy to find an opponent, it is a classic and can provide you with hours and hours of gaming and entertainment. 

It definitely deserves the nickname of cardboard crack though, because once you start and get hooked you'll want to get all the expansions and modules.

It is a good game no doubt, but at the same time I think it falls a bit short on the tactic side or maybe I should say real life tactics compared to the mass of rules you have to remember. I think I have just been spoiled by Combat Mission the PC game.

And also it is a bit like a demanding and clingy mistress that won't let you play around and try other games much because of the sheer dedication it requires.

If you were stranded on a desert island with just one game, this is definitely the one you want though.

International player base with enough variation in terms of scenarios and expansions to never let you run out of play options. Sadly availability has been mediocre of late and the current publishers are unable to keep the core rules and base module in print. Excellent interactive turn sequence that is only enhanced by the availability of probably the best online gaming aid available for any boardgame in the form of VASL. Scenarios are available online, and even if one did not play any other scenarios than those, one would have a lifetime's enjoyment.

Wish I hadn't bought this turkey. It has many cumbersome rules that only a geek would want to memorize anyway. A&A miniatures although lite by these standards is alot more playable, learnable and a more positive enjoyable experience. Save your money as you'll have to invest enormous sums to get to a point where this system becomes realistic and fun.

Simply the best game ever.

ASL is not a game, it is my hobby, it is part of my lifestyle. I have attended over 50 tournaments all over the world, am the tournament director of the Arnhem event, have been involved in scenario design and play at the highest competitive level.

Embrace this game only if you are willing to let go of all others.

A good game marred by convoluted rules and a prevalent feeling that it is a simulation of WWII squad combat.  This, it is not.  While very deep and complex in it's rule-base, it only serves to complicate the obvious and obfuscate the fact that deep down, it is a you-go-I-go game that pretends to be accurate.

Fantastic WWII tactical squad level wargame. That's a huge plus. However, drawbacks include that you have to purchase rulebook seperately and must have the first module in order to play and must purchase additional modules in order to play any additional countries that are not Germany or USSR. Also at times I feel bogged down by the morale rules, but very realistic and very well done.

Well, this is just as great as they say it is.  Learning from the Starter Kits seems like a great way to program the instruction.  Each SK added something fun and interesting and the jump to full ASL did the same.  It's harder for me to remember all of the concealment and bypass options, etc., but they add up to a wonderful richness.

A game that has given me much pleasure over the years, in spite of its 'everything including the kitchen sink' and 'detail for detail's sake' design. It feels as if the lunatics took over the asylum for this game, larding the original Squad Leader with too much detail. The game is scored relatively low because competition play has diminished the game in my eyes. Tournament players have leveraged the rules in order to win, and modelling of WW2 has been forgotten. The infighting and arguments over issues such as VBM sleaze are one reason why this gets no play any more.

RATING: 10
I'm still on Starter Kit level but already I'll claim that this is the ultimate gaming experience ever. Slowly I'll be moving towards the full RB but meanwhile I'm enjoying every moment of it.

Games tend to be quite long (three hours and up) but if time can be arranged, I'm totally into it. The experience can be really rewarding. When you spend many many minutes planning an almost perfect attack and get it work... totally awesome feeling, really.

The SK sets new standard in counter/map quality for me. I consider them astonishingly beautiful and just enough retro-looking to be a joy to the eye. Simple, clear and practical. Although some of the vehicle counters contain text too small for me to read without blinking (and for those texts I have my opponents to tell me what reads there).

The rules of this system can be truly overwhelming to learn. I spent meny hours with SK rules. The best way still to learn all this is to get the SKs and ask somebody to teach you. It'll be A LOT easier to start from SK level and slowly increase the enjoyment towards full ASL.

I don't consider this the only game I'll ever play. Many aspects of WW2 are interesting and this game brings them to life. The system contains enourmously well view of WW2 which is a great thing: a lot of options, something for everybody.
 
The only restricting factor to me with this game is the lack of opponents and because of that I won't get to play as often as I would like... 
Oh well, this gem is only a drop in the ocean - but it's still one of the brightest.

Although Squad Leader was what drew me into wargaming, I have to say, I am really happy with ASL.  I like the idea that you can just put in what elements you feel are significant and toss out those that you feel aren't.  Plenty of tactical and strategic decisionmaking makes this game fun.  Unfortunately, its too rules heavy and long for it to hit the table much anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This was once an excellent, no, a most brilliant game that has become more and more overwrought. All that efforts to make it a better "simulation" by mechanics (and it is still a lousy simulation) strangled a most exciting game that got its thrill from feeling and effects and not from reality enforcing rules. An estimated third of the voluminous rules is pure surplus chrome that does nothing for the system. The much needed excessive revision by weeding out all that superfluous stuff will not happen though - the followers of the system have invested too much time to be [willing to be] able to accept such an overhaul. It's a pity. But it gave me countless thrilling hours with friends and still enjoys me, so I'm annoyed but not gutted. 

The GAME would be an 11, the current appearance is more a 7 due all that cumbersome make-ups. So let's say it is a 9 and drop a tear.

A classic 80s take on wargaming. 
It took the old Squad Leader system that had gotten larded up with chrome and tried to rationalize the IGO-UGO mechanics with an absurdly complex set of phases..
The system also goes into incredible detail at the technical level - rules for almost every type of weapon etc. Yet with all the rules there is little to cover the effects of command or morale. 

It is a "lifestyle" game, you have to play it a lot to get past the rule curve. However this has way too much overhead for me to want to invest my time. Ultimately it is a game I don't want to deal with.

RATING: 7
Easily the most detailed, complex, and comprehensive simulation of WWII small unit tactics ever printed.  

Unfortunately,  it's not a system you can play just every so often,  then come back to it months later and pick up where you left off.  

Learning the ASL system is akin to working on achieving a degree program.  You need to devote a lot of time not only learning, but need to play it often to keep the volumes of rules fresh in your mind. 

I had the time to devote to it in my early 20's,  but not so much anymore. I returned to ASL a couple of years ago, but I've since learned that I just can't justify spending over 3 hours simulating a ten minute scenario.

It has been ages since I played this game.  This is one of those games that you either love or hate due to the amount of information.  This is a detailed players game and not for the light of heart.  The key is never move in stacks, keeping a fire base and remember to use smoke when you have it.  We played every week with a different scenario (in sequential order) for over four years.  I have very fond memories of the games and the people I gamed with.

Played this when I was a teenager with all my mates and more recently actually. Used to love it but probably because everyone else knew and understood the rules and I just stumbled along having read basic SL and thinking that was enough to see me through - and it usually was. Some memorable games, many of them huge and great fun. Things began to get bad when my mates got jobs and wives and I had to figure the rules out for myself - the it got boring with too much time flickin through rules. Got rid of everything now (almost) - will probly never play again.

A caveat: If ASL came packaged with the Retro ruleset option enclosed, then this game would get a 10 because regular guys would at least have a low-complexity option to access and play this game of grand-design.
But as it is, this rating would have been a "1" if not for the amazing "look" and fundamental design aspects of the game; the shear amount of work and audacity has to be respected--but ultimately it has been a vexing demon to thousands of baffled adults, young and old, for decades. This doesn't feel like a successful legacy.
Perhaps it was a CIA psychological experiment to see how much complexity a person can be enticed by and tolerate before collapsing? (I've always felt that a lab-coated scientist with a clipboard was watching me thru a two-way mirror as I hopelessly flipped pages for an hour before having the courage to move a unit.) Was someone purposely taking "a joke too far", here? (Sorry, Cornelius)
If ASL added another 200 pages of rules, it would sell out instantly. There simply would be no limit to the madness, and this is why I cannot rate it any higher.

RATING: 10
The best tactical simulation ever designed. Based on the classical John Hill Squad Leader is a neverending system in which is possible to recreate the whole WWII conflict on any theatre of operation. This one is only the set of game rules so it is necessary to own one of the endless titles available. ASL is aparently a complex game system but once you dig into the rules it is not as difficult as it appears. This set of rules is complete and long and you will add chapters as you buy new titles. I recommend to go to the chapter K "Squad Leader Training Manual" and read it completely. Afterwards, you should be able to play most of the scenarios. Another chance is to try using one of the starter kits available. Finally, this is a must have, but if you like it, you probably will dedicate your entire life to the system, so beware!! :)

The original Squad Leader was my favorite wargame of all time. When ASL came out, I had hoped to find a concise,comprehensive rework of the SL rules, with the most obvious flaws either fixed, or at least improved upon. Not only did they fail once with the original ASL ['85'], but twice, when MMP tried again in the 90's. I own most of the ASL stuff, and have played it, so I did give it a shot. They did a wonderful job of reworking the Defensive Fire Phase, which was the obvious flaw of the original Squad Leader System. If they had left it at that, and then just put out a nice single volume rulebook, which was the other most obvious flaw of the original Squad Leader, the game today would still have a growing player base. Instead, this game is played by a small group of players, and it will always be so. It's a shame. I have to give it a one, if for no other reason, because they failed to get it right two times.

ASL is the only wargame I have ever been able to get non-wargamers to play. The reason for this, I believe, is that ASL works at a level that anyone can visualize: a tank is a tank, a house is a house, etc. In contrast to this, for example, maneuvering tank & infantry corps across a map of Russia is not something that most people can relate to or visualize. The fact that non-wargamers can jump right into a game of ASL and have fun shows that, while ASL is certainly a complex game, the core rules that are always in play are not difficult to learn and understand. Much of ASL's complexity comes from the sheer quantity of the rules: there seems to be a rule, and a die roll modifier, for just about everything. But most of these rules are not in play in any given game, and as long as there is one person present who does understand the rules, ASL can be played and enjoyed far more easily than you might expect. ASL is probably the ultimate wargame.

I played this alot between 1985 and 1992, and then gave it up in disgust.  I don't mind luck in games, but this has a far too high luck factor given the amount of time you have to spend with the rules.  Fortunately I kept the components, because the Retro variant rules set from Minden Games makes it possible for me to use the components in games I actually enjoy playing.

RATING: 9
A monster game (# of rules not number of  counters) but a good one.  Much easier to play and more logical than the old Squad Leader with all of its expansions.  Some very clever ideas compared to old Squad Leader. The organization of the rules is amazing, usually I have less trouble finding a rule with this game than many games with rules 1/50 the size.

Another advantage to this game is that if you pick a small scenario with a few infantry you can play the scenario twice in 4-5 hours.  If you have the time and want to spend an afternoon and evening, play a company sized engagement with off board artillery and a bunch of tanks.

I've been playing more with some local guys. Great fun to be playing ASL again.

The definitive squad level WW2 game. Steep learning curve but very satisfying game. But since the emergence of the Combat Commander series I have switched to playing that instead as it still gives a great game without the large rules overhead.

This game is growing on me and every game has been fun and tense (if not abit frustrating sometimes) in which time seems to fly by.  Main issues are with the huge 700 page manual and the results being over-reliant on dice.  However, its still a very good game with a lot of tactical depth and tense game play. Can see why its a classic that its played till today despite its heavy nature.

This does seems to be a "lifestyle" type of game and I am not sure if I can commit fully to it but once you don't play it for a while, you will probably lose touch with the rules and game play and all the accumulated experience previously gained.

An exceedingly strong game of WWII tactical combat. I don't have the time, money, or inclination to collect and paint miniatures, so this game has to satisfy similar urges for me.

I could wish for a slightly simpler, cleaner game - and it sounds like such may exist now. Sadly for them, *one* game on this subject is enough for me; I generally go for operational and strategic-level games.

As a game, it is still remarkably clean considering how much *is* included. The fact that anything can, and will, happen in a game is one of its best selling points. Also, the 'entire OB in one package' works well, as it makes extra scenarios easy to do.

Arguably, the greatest war game system yet designed. ASL allows players to play a basic simple scenario, or to add as much complexity as they like.

In some respects, the ASL system is an accurate simulation of tactical combat during WWII. In othe respects, the ASL systme is not an accurate simulation of tactical combat during WWII. Its scope and detail is unsurpased. It's depth and complexity is unsurpased.

Wow, does anyone still play this. I remember giving up on it 12-15 scenarios in (each scenario adds a new section of rules, now I don't have a problem with that but 3-4 scenarios in you've mastered the entire basic set of Star Fleet Battles, 3-4 scenarios in on ASL you're still setting up your first mortar). It isn't that it is a bad game, if the rating was based solely on quality of game I would rate it a lot higher. No the problem is for any wargame in a post-DBM world is that people have shown you can streamline rules far more than this without losing any of the tactical detail so why give yourself the headache.

"The Ultimate Wargame of WW2 tactical warfare".
The virus bit me in 1986 (and I already was infected by the SL series since 1982).
I am totally addicted to that wonderfull game.
No wargame is a simulation in the absolute, and ASL is not a simulation. But it is about the most realistic tactical wargame on the market.
If one has the guts to try it, even facing the bulk of the rules, one discovers a whole world of fun, of history, of challenging games.
From Normandy to Burma, from Lybia to Poland, from Stalingrad to Narvick : thousands of scenarios make you immerge in WW2.

--Jan2009-- I've "played" this - on a technicality.
Years ago, my fine younger brother was desperate for opponents, and I was willing to give it a shot as a sort of RPG.  I told Dan what I intended for my forces to do, he translated that into game mechanics, and we had some fun.  I really enjoyed the experience (and very possibly more than Dan did) but I can't say I ever learned enough to play on my own.

RATING: 5
My feelings toward this game are complicated, as is the game itself. At certain times of my life, this has been a "10." It has also gone a decade-plus unplayed. At this present moment--where I am enjoying shorter, simpler games--I have to give this a "5" on my very-tough scale.

The rules to ASL should be "living," free, and readily available online. It is at once both amusing and sad that this is not the case. It is 2017 and players of this game are still talking in forums about rulebook errata, and--seriously--pasting errata stickers into their old rulebooks. I mean...funny and sad, right?

No serious attempt seems to be being made by the caretakers of this game to do anything but squeeze the last few dollars out of the stone...

With rules to pander to every wargamers taste in WWII combat. I was never miffed that my original Squad Leader series was made obsolete by ASL. I must admit that I was absolutely immersed in Cross of Iron, but I never really played Crescendo of Doom or GI, just too many odd rules that seemed thrown in pretty ad hoc. The added realism, the research, and the armory notes (Chapter H) that make for great reading have been well worth my time for the last twenty-three years. I play little else but ASL and have never regretted it.

A truly epic undertaking. The game itself is immensely fun, but suffers somewhat from the rulebook being tome-sized. 

Yeah, that's kinda the point, but it means this game is only worth playing with devotees, and only when you've time enough to devote days beforehand to refreshing yourself. 

I enjoy the game, but don't see myself playing it often. However, when I do play it it's one of the best sources for realistic and interesting WW2 tactics, and some gaming memories which are impossible to beat.

Initial reaction: I've enjoyed the depth and narrative of Squad Leader, so ASL seems worth a try. Movement and reaction fire seems a clear improvement, the sheer weight of other rules may not be. Would like to try some of the more interesting scenarios that utilise special rules - eg, Pegasus Bridge. Easy to see how this can be a hobby in itself. The question is whether I can dabble meaningfully while still mostly committed to playing other games? Helpful to have a committed player willing to play and teach whenever I'm able to fit in a game.

Best. Game. Series. Ever! .. For me ASL is the kind of game I always wanted to play back in the days, but never had the people to play with. Luckily that has changed now and from the games I've tried ASL really serves my interests best. (I would give it a 12 or 13 if possible! =)

RATING: 8
Lots and lots of rules is why gamers choose the advanced version I suppose. More a religion than a game. At the end of a long match it can all come down to one die roll - so not much different from some much simpler games I can think of that don't obsess about every little detail.

When you have a decent understanding of the rules you can really begin o enjoy the game. The bluffing. The story arc. The simulation. Excellent game - just wish I could play it more to get a better grasp of all the rules.

This a great system. This is the only WW2 tactical game I'll play.  Thanks to VASL I can play this more often now.
This is THE game for tactical level gaming.  Every theater, every nation is depicted with hundred's of scenario's.  After 25 years it is still the benchmark for tactical gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
  A game of allocating resources, taking positions for key elements, always testing your flexibility, while at the same time trying to achieve an objective before time runs out.  Never a dull moment on this battlefield! Both players are working in nearly every phase, making this the most engaging hex and counter warfare gaming experience I've ever played.  Fun to collect and organize but PRICEY with a STEEP learning curve.  However, once you learn the core rules, the game can flow smoothly.

  This game is also as big as you want to make it with unlimited options, from half a map board and a few units with a support weapon, to table-top consuming map configurations and a HUGE amount of chits!  You decide how much time you have and your pain threshold, then pick the scenario to match, or just make your own and add as much complexity as you want.  Don't want to deal with wind, fire, or OBA?  Then don't use them, scale the game to YOUR preference.  Infinite replayability and never the same game twice!  A TRUE wargame classic!

Utterly absorbing. 

The system rules are astoundingly easy to grasp, given the density of the system, because of their unflinching internal consistency, and wargaming's best index. 

ASL is blessed with thousands of well crafted and tested scenarios, the majority of which will provide a balanced game between opponents of similar experience. 

And despite the volume of die rolls, many games will hinge on the final throw of the dice

Some of  the most enjoyable and tense games ever played were ASL scenario's. It takes time to learn and nobody ever masters it. Good players can be beaten by poorer ones on occasion, it rewards experience but does require a lot of personal investment to be able to play. Not for the faint hearted, not a pick up game but is attainable with effort.

Oy, the Rules!!!  Best to get someone to teach you this game, or do a lot of solitare experimentation. Scenarios are usually playable within 2-4 hours, and you don&#039;t usually need much space (coffee table works). However, If you&#039;re adverse to games with lots of rules, rate ASL &#039;0 out of 10&#039;.

RATING: 3
Pretty much the poster child for what can go wrong with a wargame.  It took a much simpler base game in Squad Leader and drowned it in extra detail that did nothing to improve the quality of the game or the quality of the simulation.  The details are all in the wrong places, undone by the complete absence of anything recognizable as a command and control system.  The historical modules are wonderful looking, only the scale is completely wrong, so you get a woefully distorted result that looks superficially like it is really simulating something.  It's telling that both John Hill and Don Greenwood, the two men most directly responsible for ASL, have essentially disowned the system.  I know it's immensely popular and more power to the people who get enjoyment from it, but I'm not buying what it's selling.

The best tactical wargame on the market. With the starter kits it's actually easier to learn than some of the games with tons of plastic pieces. 

While it is turn based, the game mechanism is interactive with the defender during a player's turn able to respond during movement to an attackers action.

It's nearly infinitely variable with the full order of battle of all nations in WWII including all tanks and fighting vehicles that appeared on all battlefields during the war. 

There are hundreds if not thousands of scenarios available and with VASL you can nearly always find an opponent online.

Also available are Historical Modules where you can fight in the streets of Stalingrad with maps rendered from war time reconnaissance photos and even fight the entire battle of Tarawa in the South Pacific.

I suggest purchasing Starter Kit #1 which is infantry only and costs in the $20-25 range and taking the chance of getting hooked. It can be expensive if you purchase all available modules but the starter kits allow you to get started with little risk.

ASL, It's not just a game, it's a religion. Played the original Squad Leader in college, and thought it was great. I held off on ASL until the mid-90s, when I took the plunge in a big way. Actually read the rules cover to cover, admired the thinking that went into it, the artistry of the maps, the quality of the components. I would pull the modules out and read over the scenarios. I spent countless hours enjoying this game series... and never cut out a counter. If all you ever played in your wargaming life was ASL, you could rightly claim to have spent your time well, but I have other games to play.

This is a tough one to rate .  It is a good game and a load of fun if you can play it regularly--but it takes regular playing to keep the games running relatively smoothly, and even then you have to not mind looking up rules.  

The problem is, even though I think the game is quite good, I don't have the desire to play it so often that the rules become mostly second nature, which means much of the game is slogging through rules look-ups.

Back when the game first came out, it was easy to make the commitment to play all the time as it simply didn't have that much competition for attention.  These days there are so many good games, both wargames as well as solid euros (like Wallace games and 18xx games) that it DOES have lots of competition.  Which means, even though I truly might like playing this every few game nights, playing less that once a month leaves me perpetually in the having to re-look stuff up mode...which means the game is less fun, which means I have less desire to play it.

What do you say? It is simply the standard WWII tactical game. It isn't just a game, it can be a lifestyle. It set in my closet for years, but when I was fortunate to move to a city with an active club, I was hooked. Yes it has a huge rulebook and yes it can be daunting to teach yourself, but after one or two playings with an experienced opponent, the "wow" factor clicks in. No one knows all the rules off the top of their head. And that is OK. You just learn the additional rules whenever you want. If you don't play PTO, you don't have to learn the Japanese and PTO terrain rules. Don't want to learn the night rules? Don't play night scenarios. It has something for everybody. You could spend a lifetime just playing infantry scenarios if that was all you wanted to do. The only reason it doesn't get a 10 is because half of the basic modules are out of print.

Better than ASLSK. Concealment adds so much to the game. I cant see myself going back to the SK. Lots and lots of rules, but I am sticking to infantry-only scenarios for now, and it helps a whole lot that I have a FtF opponent/teacher to guide me through the game.

I can see why ASL is so popular. It really is a lot of fun and I will be playing it much more in the future.

After 2 plays: Ok Im hooked. I'll be attending all the NorCalASL meetups I can.

I have a real love/hate relationship with this game.

I enjoy it for its thoroughness.  The game system has been used to model tactical WW2 squad combat in nearly every theater.  There are rules for just about every type of weapon used in the war and the sheer amount of research that has gone into the product we have today is truly impressive.

The variety of scenarios for the game is simply overwhelming.  Some of the very best scenarios can capture my imagination just as long as some games.

If you are willing to handle the sheer load of rules that go with the game then you have what it takes to potentially like it.

Unfortunately, there are also some serious deficits.  The over-reliance on random die rolls to determine so many things makes the game very dependant on luck.  Random die rolls control everything from some forms of movement to the availability of certain weapon types.  Does your unit have a panzerfaust?  You won't know until the moment you really need it.  The Panzer sleeze rule is absurd and frustrating.

Ultimately, I think there must be a better way to play out tactical engagements from World War 2.

It's clear you won't learn this game by simply reading the rulebook. It must be tought to you which in itself is an amusing paradox.

It does hold the potential to offer a more dramatic experience than simpler systems like Conflict of Heroes but I'm not convinced that this validates the time you need to invest in the system.
I'm happy with CoH and Panzer.

For a long time in late 80's and early 90's I played ASL almost exclusively and bought every module.  I had been playing SL since the late 70's and before that Tobruk and really enjoyed the gritty and chaotic feel of these tactical games.  I know it has it's share of critics concerning it's so called lack of realism, but come on folks think about what you are saying.  No paper and cardboard wargame played a table is realistic and none ever will be.  The bottom line is that ASL, despite its rulebook, is just a ton of fun to play.

THE WWII tactical combat game. The basic mechanics are quite simple once you get the hang of them, and additional or optional rules add to the chrome and flavor of the game.

I play most games via VASL live or pbem

I rate this a 5 because I generally am not in favor of forking established games with a new edition of rules (e.g., D&D) and the resulting fracturing of the hobby (see also ASLSK). Although I don't use this edition of the rules, I do like it because it includes a useful OBA flowchart, which I use with my first edition rules. I also like the larger print than first edition.

VERY disappointed when this game came out many a year ago.  AH promised the same game with a few tweaks.  Well, they made it almost unplayable.  Add the fact that the original 4 Squad Leader games included everything you needed to play any scenario.  ASL required a massive outpouring of cash to get anywhere near the coverage. I bought much of the ASL games just to sell everything off in a fit of frustration with the game system and cost.  IMHO a very poor showing that killed off a great game.

Great game for completeness and scope of action, but MMP missed a great opportunity to streamline the rules and clean up some "gamey" artifacts in the system when they produced the 2nd edition rulebook in 2001. Not a "lifestyle" game as many claim, but the rules depth offers a much more rewarding gaming experience than its detractors (many of whom have never even attempted to play the game) would admit. Also not as difficult to comprehend as the size of the rulebook would imply.

A friend of mine showed me this years ago, and it looked interesting, but we didn't get a chance to play it.

Then around 1999 or so, I was looking into getting a tactical level WW2 boardgame, and I remembered ASL. I looked it up, and found out that a) you needed several games in order to have all the necessary rules to play; and b) those games weren't in print, but could be found on eBay for astronomical prices; and c) the rules were so complex as to bog down game play; and d) it was not solitaire friendly. So I said no way to that and looked elsewhere.

Then I found ATS (Advanced Tobruk System) and bought Advanced Tobruk, which was based on an old favorite, Avalon Hill's 'Tobruk', which I played over and over again (and still have!).

I am now hooked on ATS, which answers all my problems above, and is much more easily playable, and in a shorter amount of time.

RATING: 8
How can I bear to give it a lower rating after spending so much money?  On the down side, there is a huge -- unnecessarily huge -- number of rules here.  Even SPI's Air War can't compete on this score.  Much of the complexity is apparently for complexity's sake.  Being among the few who are able (or crazy enough) to master the rules is perversely enjoyable in itself -- but some rather laughable blind spots can result in such people.  It's amazing how much effort ASL fans will put into defending those aspects of the rules that simply make no sense in terms of realism, and are not sufficiently streamlined to justify in terms of "playability".  You'd have to be clueless at geometry to imagine that the line-of-sight rules make sense, for example.  But having said all that against the game, there are two things that stand out in its favour: (1) The game does manage to capture the feel of its subject matter very well.  (2) There is enough going on tactically to make it interesting; moreover (and surprisingly), you don't need to know the rules, as long as your opponent does (and is honest).  That is, good tactical thinking about the scenario in question will usually be reflected in the outcome.  The rules are "natural" in this sense.  This is a big plus!  Ultimately though, my high rating comes from the "guilty pleasure" department.

I maybe unfair giving it a 2 but I won't ever play this again (hence the 2). It's way too complex, I feel you either dedicate your gaming life to this or you don't play it. I tried it, slogged through the rules, played it a few times and thought no, this is too much.  I would also question how realistic it is? For all it's complexities does it actually simulate WWII fire fights? I really really doubt it. However I feel it's a land mark game and hence I'll not part with my copy

I've been playing (or rather, learning the rules) since it came out.  I drug the rules and modules around during the second half of my Army career, occasionally finding other active duty folks who played.  After a few years away from the game, I have found some more players in the Dayton area and am picking up where I left off.

I stuck with this system all the way from John Hill's original SL through Code of Bushido. Eventually I realized the rules weight-to-fun ratio wasn't paying off for me. And after playing the Gamers TCS system, I decided ASL was pretty bad as a tactical simulation as well. So I sold the whole lot off. 

A few years later, I thought I kinda missed it, so I started buying it all up again, this time paying crazy eBay prices. And after three modules or so, I realized no, I really was over this game. So I sold 'em all again. And I know, this time, I won't go back.

If I am ever injured and stuck in bed for 6 months on disability, I might learn how to play this game.

A "life-style" version for the Squad Leader fanatic who wants the game to be even slower, more mired down in minutia, and abstruse.

It's still not a simulation and the wonderful "cinematic" feel that the original Squad Leader evoked has been completely lost.

An example of a re-development that managed to completely miss what made the original game interesting and innovative.

ASL is a game I've played over 500 times.  It's replayability, in depth game play and exciting bits of chrome are the top attractors to me.

I do not think of ASL as a game of "reality" but simply a game with enough WWII chrome to give it some historical leverage while providing some sense of the actoins the various scenarios depict.

For those who have put fortht the effort to learn how to play it is usually a "10" and not because they would feel bad putting so much effort into a poor game.  We see it for what it is and enjoy for what it is.

I'll always play it if someone suggests.

Played a lot with friends. The system and modules are very complete and I'm sure the data is very accurate BUT the rules are way over the top. I've played a lot of boardgames and miniatures but this is ridiculous. The same results could have been obtained with a lot less grief and a bit mor eof an integrated approach to rules, effect and outcomes.

Without a doubt one of the great games of yesterywar which pioneered a lot of other games and approaches BUT personally I don't like it. I just can't front 200+ pages of rules and exceptions to play an my poor old memory is about useless now.

Words cannot do this game justice. If you are at all interested in WWII tactical combat, you owe it to yourself to give this system enough of an effort to make a decent judgment about it.

This one has it all for it's genre.  It offers lots of toys and details for using those toys.  The full range of reaction of men under fire.  Any kind of scenario and variable you can think of in WW2 ground combat, it's in this game.  Unlike Star Fleet Battles or Car Wars, I was a much later newcomer to this game, but it offers everything I want, toys, room to expand and a big player base.

As far as this genre goes, this is THE GAME.

I really can't rate this.  Fantastic game for those who like cardboard solders and have an opponent or two.  Back before dat inturnat thing it was much harder to find and teach folk.

Oddly enough I got beat a good deal at wargames but loved playing them.

This one is twice owned.  The Two Half Squads convinced me to reacquire it, and I've been playing regularly for about 9 months.  The game is extremely rich and varied, covering all major theaters, nationalities and aspects of WWII tactical combat.  The community is very helpful, and this is essential if you really aspire to master the game.  If I tried scenarios beyong basic infantry solo, I'd still spend the bulk of my time looking up rules.  The game presents a tremendous number of variables to consider simultaneously (like real combat), and while I'm becoming a barely adequate defender, I still get bogged down trying to figure out how to attack effectively.  When and if I become more proficient, I suspect my rating will increase.  A great game if you plan to devote a lot of time to it, but definitely not for the casual gamer.

This game has been unfairly labeled for years.  Unfortunately, this kept me from ever getting involved with the game.  After playing it a fair amount for the past year, I can say that it does take some effort to get into, but once you play it a couple of times it comes together well.  The key is to keep in mind that you don't have to have the rule book memorized.  Remember the basics, and then prior to a battle read up on the specifics for the scenario (terrain types, special rules, armor, etc., etc.).  If you keep this in mind, this is a very enjoyable game that has extensive replay value.  The initial investment may be high, but the time/cost ratio is one of the best you will find.

RATING: 9
Unbelievably complex. Hard to find an opponent, but good fun when you can.

Update: Check out www.vasl.org! There is a free downloadable Java Program that replaces everything you need to play except the rules, some charts, and the scenario cards: Maps, pieces, the QRDC, and other stuff is built in. It also has a opponent search, but I haven&#039;t tried that yet.

The most complex and realistic (yet abstract at the same time) board game system of WWII era warfare yet developed.  Takes a while to learn certain game concepts and a volume of rules but once understood, one of the most enjoyable WWII game systems out there.  The game system allows playing every engagment type and force structure involved from the 1920s to the 1950s.  However, If you think Axis & Allies is hard to learn, stay away!  If interested and never played before, I highly recommend using the ASL Starter Kits to get into the game.

I got in on this game when it came out, because a couple of my friends played it all the time. I have to admit that I never really got into having to look up rules all the time, for every single action or event-but maybe that was just the way they played, and not the fault of the game. I have not played this game for a long time.

It's definitely a way of life.  I flirt with other tactical games from time to time, but experience can't beat this one.

Just started playing this game. There's a lot to learn, but taking it slow it's actually quite doable and a lot of fun.

Great game, very complex.  Too much so for casual gaming.  I do like wargames and I wish I had the time to spend developing a better sense of this game, but it truly can become consuming.  I doubt that I could play again without having to read all the rules, as I haven't played in a while.  I would say don't buy this game unless you are willing to invest a significant amount of time in learning to play.

Desert island game. Lots of support, never run out of scenarios. But I think I might just prefer classic Squad Leader...

RATING: 7.5
It is definitely better than Squad Leader and it's three gamettes. But it is far too complicated in terms of kindling modifier stuff to be really enjoyable.

After I took the plunge (it took me about a year to decide to make the leap from SL to ASL) it took me a decade and a half to collect all the modules (and I am still at least 5 behind). I knew it would be a life commitment and I have never been sorry. I have played people from California, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Tennessee, Alabama and Hawaii (and probably some other states, too). It's my favorite game even though I have a large collection (well, maybe not large to collectors) and play many other games, too (including those one-dimensional woodblock & tile Euro-elite games).

Faint-hearted need not apply. A 25-year old simulation that has stood the test of time. The quintessential squad-level tactical game with no equal. Well worth the time investment. Greatly improved on the deficencies of Squad Leader

The ultimate tactical WWII wargame (not simulation). Not for everyone but very much for me. Only downside is I don't have much time to play anything else.

My favorite game.  It is THE game of tactical combat during WWII.  Nothing else compares!

RATING: 5
Played this a lot in the 80s and 90s, but eventually realized that insane complexity does not equal realism. The lack of meaningful command and control (among other things) results in a game that is hyper-detailed in many aspects but in no way simulates WWII tactical combat.

4/4/08 - From what I can tell, battle at this scale is an extremely chaotic affair.  ASL seems to capture this in some regards, but not in others, and I find there to be a dichotomy in the final result that nags at me.  On one hand, the rigid turn structure, your ability to move around, combine firepower factors and know the exact position of the enemy and what modifications will be made to your attack for shooting at them, are all empirically-known at all times throughout the game.  These things really clash with the high degree of random elements that can pop into the game from the dice rolls (i.e. ELR, snipers, going berserk, cowering, battle hardening, etc).  So the game is interesting to play, but the vast degree by which the elements of chance are separated from the rest is bothersome, and, for me, interferes with the game's sense of realism.  I'm anxious to see if Advanced Tobruk provides some relief to this disparity.

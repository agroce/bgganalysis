The best La Bataille ... period. A must buy, a must own and a must play!!

RATING: N/A
The simplified version of the La Bataille rules are far more manageable than the BAR system but although an excellent simulation of Napoleonic warfare even the simplified rules are very challenging. Even the shortest scenarios take many hours.

Simply one of the best LaBat titles. Beautiful components, great entry point with the ML rules, though Marshall Enterprises recession series is the best for new folk.

awesome game. Detailed and with some practice, very playable. This is a monster game and it would be better to have 2-3 players per side and the graphics are a work of art.

This beautiful beast arrived the other week. It must be the mother of all wargames, and the empress of my collection!
 I have played the Shervardino scenario but I don't know if I will ever have the time to play the whole battle of Borodino.  I would rate it higher if it wasn't so huge and unmanageable ... I love COA's work here and only blame Messrs Bonaparte and Kutusov for fighting such a bloody big battle!!

The detailed map is an art by itself. The counters are well design according to the branch: infantry, artillery or cavalry. This is a monster wargame; after all this was one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the era. The order of battle i.e. to find every unit and place it in the correct box so as to know who belongs to which division and under which command, is a challenge by itself. For the game rules one can use two rule booklets: The 'Reglement de l'an XXX' or the 'Reglement de Marie-Louise'. Although titles are in French, content is in English. Using the former is like looking at the “Advanced Squad Leader” of the Napoleonic era – so highly detailed that sacrifices playability. Using the latter, the play goes easier but still one has to keep a lot in mind while moving, charging or fighting. Several player aids help you to this task. The game gives you a real taste of the Napoleonic art of war. Highly historical with accurate results. You just need lots of patience and time to enjoy this fine wargame.

Just getting started with this series, so the rating is tentative, but it certainly does force you to think about the interaction between the various branches of the army.

Clash of Arm's La Bataille series embody everything  wargames should be. So good! Components are fantastic, a truly beautiful game. Game play is rich with critical decisions. system design creates epic moments in the game such as a crucial leader being wounded at the worst possible moment. my favorite game solo, 2 player, multiplayer. i love it! mechanics of the game allow the player to experience the many facets of Napoleonic formations, combined arms warfare, and command.

Great gaming experience, extraordinary match between a complex game -with interesting scenarios-  and a simplified version of rules.
I hope that this will be the first of a new generation of la bataille series.

The new Regs rules appear to be easy reading. Perfect.  My copy of La Bataille de la Moscowa arrived in less than 2 weeks after the last minute preorder.  Hats off to CoA customer service.  With the box still unwrapped at hand, the components already give weight.  The box cover is an astonishing art masterpiece. An unquestionable winner.

I want to plan a game of this monster. The designer Terry Doherty suggests that Shevardino and the Bagration Fleches scenario would work with the huge maps that can be completed with multiplayers in a day session of about 6 hours.

Beautiful.  Imposing.  Dense and detailed.  Attempting to learn it has been challenging but absorbing.  A game that I will invest time in - probably mostly solo.  The game prompted me to read much more about the battle (thanks Book Depository!) than I ever had, in order to appreciate the game more fully.  It was good fun reading the battle scenes from War and Peace with the map open in front of me.

Absolutely gorgeous game of one of my favourite napoleonic battles. I love the maps and counters. And played with the Marie-louise rules, have some chance of finishing this giant.

I look forward to the Marie-Louise rules and applying them to other games in the system. The look alone of this one gets me going.

XXX rules are clearly the best one in the subject. The top quality of all and every component in this particular game makes this new 200th edition an absolute must for everygamer interested in Napoleonic Tactical Combat. Every month, day, minute and second awaiting this game has been highly rewarded.

I originally bought the 1975 GDW version back in the day and at that time it was the most beautiful monster game on the market.  I mean gorgeous for its time.  Gave it away along with hundreds of other games. Stupidity.  But this one is also pretty to look at, as well as to play.

Received 4/18/2011.  Stunning package, great game. With these big battles it's always interesting to look at vignettes of the fighting all over the map - many small stories combined into a grand picture.

RATING: 10
The more I play this, the more I am enjoying it. The activation system linked with the ability to perform larger activations adds an intriguing element to play and a high degree of replayability. Excellent smaller scenarios when space is limited

The introductory Shevardino scenario would have to be the best scenario for new gamers to this system!

Stunning components, gorgeous map. Haven't mastered the full full just playing with Marie Louise. This game is the ASL of napoleonic games. While I am still a beginner I can see why this is considered a masterpiece where an experienced play will demolish a lesser cardboard general. Creates both the tactical and strategic feel of Napoleonic battles and terrific stories in the process.

Will receive this week and look forward to diving into the Marie-Louise Rules.  I know my group will never play the game with Reg's XXX!  But it's nice to be able to play it with those rules if one chooses.

This venerable series of games is the last word in super-detailed Napoleonic's grand tactical gaming.  That's why we play it!

I will definitely be the 'odd man out' here, but I don't care. I'm giving this game a 9/10, but for entirely different reasons that everybody else is.

Yes, I love the new board, counters, charts etc...but that is where my adoration for the game ends. I DO NOT like the way the original rules have morphed into something that I barely recognize. By that, I mean the "Marie Louise" rules the "Regalement Rules" etc....

What I like to play, is the ORIGINAL game as published, OR the version that GDW published. Virtually the same game. Of course I understand that as the series grew some 'additions' had to be made for different armies. Such as the British at Talavera, Quatre Bras etc..

But this BORODINO game bears no resemblance to the original conception of the game. This was a 'historical marker' type game in the hobby. It showed that a very LARGE battle could be actually played at the Battalion/Regimental level. It would still take a long time to finish the entire battle even with the original rules. But this version is just a nightmare in my opinion.

My rating therefore is qualified. I'm really basing my evaluation on the original GDW rules.

I bought another game in this series La Bataille des Quatre Bras and thought it looked pretty good. I thought this system was similar to Battles from the Age of Reason another series from Clash of Arms games. I per-ordered La Bataille de la Moscowa, I didn't have a monster Napoleonic's game on the subject, and the production values for the La Bataille series are phenomenal. I talked to a friend and he pointed out that the two systems were not similar but that was after I had purchased all the La Bataille games I currently own, but that is okay.

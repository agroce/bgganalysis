RATING: 8
More streamlined than v1.5, but no huge differences in gameplay. Even though miniature gaming is not really "my thing" I like this game a lot. Every match generates a strong narrative which even makes it fun played solo.

An improvement on an already great game.  Feels like a very balanced, well designed minis game where you have several paths to victory (between the strategy and your schemes), and the model interactions and upgrade choices are extremely interesting.  Fantastic minis game.

The pinnacle of skirmish level fantasy wargames. Steep learning curve is a barrier to finding others to play with. Range of models might be getting bloated with some power creep/overlap. Wyrd miniatures is finally hitting their stride.

I organized a group of 6 players...we each picked up a different faction and are having fun!

Update: Wouldn't you know it...after spending a bundle on more Gremlins for my force, people stopped playing the game.

I've played many minis games over the years, and this is probably one of my favorites.
You can get an entire crew for under $100 (in Warhammer there's single models that cost that much!)

Fixes the balance problems in the previous edition for the most part and makes it an easier, more streamlined game to play without altering the theme and what makes the game unique.

Subo la nota a 10 porque cada vez que lo juego me sorprende lo increíblemente bueno que es este juego. El mejor juego de miniaturas al que he jugado nunca, con muchísima diferencia.

I've only played once at a convention, although I have several figures to paint.  It was a very fun game, but in our play, we barely scratched the surface.  It seems to have a tremendous amount of depth and novel thematic elements.

Was impressed by the demo at Salute and picked up a cheapish 2ed Rulebook - and then some figures. Waiting for my playmat and getting things painted to give it a whirl.

RATING: 8.2
I love the scenario selection in this. The rules are clean and easy to upgrade with. Ranged combat feels a little weak compared to close combat but I need a bigger sample of games to confirm that.

I feel this game may run its course quickly though if you stick with one crew - it seems most are one or two trick ponies that you have to keep repeating to win which may breed some predictability into the game.

base game design is very good. however, all models have special rules creating unforeseen combos that can break the game.

RATING: 10
Simply a fantastic game, with balanced mechanics, a deep and rich storyline and a diverse range of characters to suit nearly all tastes. The card mechanic is brilliant, as are the different Strategies and Schemes that help ensure no two games are ever the same. If I could only play one game for the rest of my life, this would be it. Highly recommended.

Think it's the best tabletop mini game I've played so far.
The Fate Deck mechanic is really quite interesting and rewards good planning and risk calculation. It reminded me of Summoner Wars with how you're often burning your deck on purpose altough the reason why is quite different here :p

The sculpts are also gorgeous!

I just love this game. It's one of the best tabletops out there, the card mechanic is really fun and I love the way, schemes and strategies are chosen. Very dynamic, heavily scenario-driven game.

Furthermore, the miniatures are very good, often on par with GW's plastic. The design is sometimes a bit strange but very iconic and has a lot of character.

An evolution to the first edition, this game feels like warmachine first edition rules with less miniatures and more power per creature, the mission system of the game its what makes it great and advanced wargame

Skirmish base miniature game. One of my main games. Malifaux second edition is almost same as ed. 1.5. There are no big changes to older edition. Mainly second ed. is faster and easier to play also it seems that the worst balance problems have been removed. I look forward to following steps.

Diceless miniatures skirmish game. Beautiful miniatures. They can compete with ones from Games Workshop.

RATING: 9
Great miniature game, the best I played and the only one actually. very Very tactical and deep, but is not for casual players. The game rules are short and easy, but to learn to play well you need time and effort, study and passion. And may not be sufficient. At the end this game is very enjoable only if you play with good players, if not the experience will be disappointing for all...and no, the problem is not the misfortune nor the imbalance, but it is only your inability! Enjoy!

drifted away from Malifaux due to an element of "silliness" I felt crept into the game.Recently purchased 2nd ed and like the sinister edge the game seems to have recaptured and the quality of the new miniature designs. Looking forward to trying this again

I would love to get models in exchange for games. If you don't have any, please check out Amazon and we can work out a trade like that!

Interesting miniatures game with a lot going for it.  The theme is quite clever and is a sort of horror-western-steampunk thingy which all holds together somehow.  The miniatures are what make it and I wouldn't recommend it to someone who does not like the aesthete.  It plays fast on a small space with a small figure count, which make it affordable, by the unaffordable standards of miniature games.

The turns are threaded which should be in all miniatures games but is not.  The game is card driven using a deck of cards.  I was not sold on the cards at first, but it is actually very clever.  It has a good scenario generation system.  Isn't true line of sight which is my preference.  The information on the stat cards, uses too small type and inconsistent and too small iconography.  Its good for a miniatures game, but years behind board games.

I find the game a bit of a brain burner at times, because all the models are quite complex.  The depth comes from the complexity of the models, primarily.

It reminds me a lot of a more complex heroscape, which I mean as a great compliment.  I've started collecting it, less with a sense of being competitive in organized play.  That's quite easy to get to, and more in a heroscapish way aimed at having a runnable crew for every faction and lots of mercenaries.  I think that should give it the kind of legs that heroscape has and the replayability that will mean I will want to and should want to play it after all the organized play dies down and the game goes out of print.

Many ways to play it. Fast or epic. Wonderfullly thematic games. Lot of hard decisions to do. You can choose your goals and missiions. You can win even if your mate kills all your models. Every game is differnet. Wonderful models. GREAT GREAT GAME. 
I played Warzone, WH, DBA, Dreamblade: this is the best i ever played.

My name is Chad Hackman and I have been running unofficial events since 1st edition.  Today, I'd like to thank my great community in the Peel Region of the GTA, Ontario for the support that has made Malifaux such a fun game to play in our area.  A Henchman doesn't make games great; it is a good group of players that give others the drive and motivation to run events and participate in campaigns.  
My region, particularly my home base at X Planet Games in Mississauga, has seen a huge influx of new and reintroduced players over the past year.  Congratulations to all of you!  I will just be wearing a shirt; you people make the games happen.

I enjoy Malifaux, when there is time. It's a complex game and it can lead to some interesting scenarios and choices. I have to be in the right frame of mind however and if I don't play for a while it feels daunting to get back into due to the steep learning curve for some of the crews.

A very complex and advanced character based skirmisher wargame which focuses equally on crew creation, goal selection and on table strategy.

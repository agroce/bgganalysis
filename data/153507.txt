In principle Terra is a straightforward trivia game. However, the trick is that you do not need to know the answer exactly. Being close enough grants you points. This introduces fresh dynamics to the game since players are susceptible group thinking. You can also push your luck with answering more questions than you actually know the answer to. This also makes it possible to have an evenly matched game even if you do not posses equal knowledge about geography.

Some minor gripes though. At least the Finnish version had some questions that were ambiguous. This is not a big thing but still it is very much possible to interpret the question wrong. Could be that questions are phrased so on purpose. Another balance related observation (especially with five or more players) is that not all players necessarily have an equal chance to win when you are playing one round only. Sure, everyone gets to answer the same questions but the maximum number of victory points available from each question is different. Thus, it may well be that the theoretical maximum for each player not the same in every game.

But I have to say that the things described above are more like observations, since the game is all about having fun and not too serious.

Πολύ καλό παιγνίδι γνώσεων με απλούς κανόνες και γρήγορο ρυθμό. Υπάρχουν κάρτες σε 3 επίπεδα δυσκολίας και περιέχουν μια φωτογραφία και 3 ερωτήσεις κυρίως με θέματα γεωγραφίας αλλά και όχι μόνο. 

Βλέπουμε τι ζητάει η κάρτα όπως πχ που είναι το Stonehedge, πότε κατασκευάστηκε και πόσες πέτρες έχει. Οι παίκτες τοποθετούν με την σειρά τα κυβάκια τους στο χάρτη ή πάνω στην ποσοτικές κλίμακες. Αν πέσουν ακριβώς μέσα τότε ο παίκτης παίρνει 7 πόντους. Αν πέσεις δίπλα στην σωστή απάντηση κερδίζεις 3 πόντους. Απλά πράματα.

ΟΚ, ίσως να μην είναι και το καλύτερο σύστημα βαθμολόγησης αλλά έχει το θετικό πως ακόμα και αν δεν γνωρίζεις την σωστή απάντηση μπορείς να πας δίπλα σε αυτόν που νομίζεις πως την ξέρει και να τσιμπήσεις κάνα βαθμουλάκι. Έτσι κανείς δεν μένει πολύ πίσω στο σκορ.

Πολύ καλή προσπάθεια αν και προσωπικά προτιμώ το Fauna καθώς βρίσκω το θέμα του πιο δύσκολο και άρα πιο ενδιαφέρον.

Juego trivial style  pero mucho más familiar ;El poder puntuar por aproximación a la respuesta correcta hace que sea mucho menos frustrante para los jugadores. 
Muy similar a fauna, pero esta vez sin preguntas de animales. En comparación con este último parece más pulido, aunque lo más probable que por mis pekes acabe con los dos en la colección.

This is a quick Earth trivia game that is easy to learn.  You are given a clue/topic and the goal of the game is to correctly identify the region where it is located, and two other traits (year, distance-length-size, and number) that are related. There are only six rounds/clues in a game, and 300 clue/total topic cards.

It's a good trivia game where you don't have to know the answer, but need to make educated guesses. I like such kinds of games (like in Wits and Wagers), and the theme of all things history, geography and zoology just clicks well with me.

It's a bit too simple, but it plays fast, and very well with higher player counts.

I don't really like trivia games concerning historical events. I find it useless to memorize dates and misc trivia.

+ The betting element made it easy to get points even if you don't have any idea of the answers. 
- Gameplay was quite slow.
- The questions could be memorized. (+ if the purpose is educational)
- The images on the cards made some questions easier (not when you're the first player to answer) ;)

It's basically Fauna with a variety of interesting topics other than animals (e.g. tallest steeple, origin of tomato, pyramids of Giza, etc.).  Each player can guess location on a map and 2 other aspects of the topic on scales (e.g. distance, year built, height, weight, etc.) and are awarded 7 points for correct answers and 3 points for answers adjacent to correct ones.  It's light trivia made fun where you can take advantage of what other people know.  For me, this worked with Fauna and works here.  Some very minor adjustments were made to simplify scoring and return cubes for making guesses back to players so they aren't lost forever.  These felt like positive changes, though not significant.

I like Fauna a lot as it’s a different – and great – take on a trivia game. My family and some friends likes Fauna as well, so it’s a game that will probably stay in the collection. Therefore, Terra was originally a “must buy” for me, but after I played it, I’m not so sure anymore… I feel Fauna is the better game, although in theory I should like Terra more – but in practice I just don’t. The questions seem a little… weird? I don’t know. Something about the questions/categories just rubbed me the wrong way and seemed off. I will definitely play it again, but whether I’m going to purchase it or not has not yet been decided. Probably not.

Best trivia game I have played. I find most trivia games either too random or too difficult. Terra allows you to take educated (or uneducated) guesses + all players can guess on the same question, so everybody feels involved, instead of having that "I know the answer to that one, but it's not my turn!"

7.5 because it's not a game I would actively try to bring to the table (but I'll play anytime)

RATING: 7
Great mechanics for a trivia type game, but I don't like that the borders on the map aren't clearly delineated. We also ran into at least one card being flat out wrong, which made players distrusting of future answers (it was a biology related question and I was playing with biologists).

The natural heir of Trivial Pursuit: 

At last we have a game where knowledge is rewarded but without beeing the only driving force towards the win. Above all, dice were swept away, as also the ridiculous need of hitting the right place to obtain the question from that theme we need...
Besides, the game has such so easy rules and plays so fast (15/20 min) that is suitable for all ages and situations, families, parties, etc.

#1 trivia game for me. I am a geographer, so the theme certainly interests me. However, the mechanic of the cube placement for different topics gives everyone at the table a chance, in spite of perceived knowledge. The number of cards provided in the game is tremendous - each game only uses 6 cards, and there are 150 provided (double-sided). So right off the bat, you have 50 possible games with absolutely no repeats. Great trivia game that is simple, but far from shallow.

The subject matter suits me better than that of Fauna, and the scoring is simpler because the items on the cards tend to be found in only one or two locations in the world, rather than the often dozen or more in Fauna. Also, compasses on some of the cards point players in the general direction of the answer. Otherwise, it's the same game.

I like these kinds of party games. You don't have to know  anything you can still guess and be close enough to score points. Sure, some people will know some of the answers, but not all of them. You can always handicap good players with fewer playing pieces.

RATING: 8
A companion game to the superb Fauna, where players take turns placing cubes on the "answers" to various geography based questions.  This one felt a bit more specialised than Fauna - you either knew it or had no idea - and while some of the scoring and mechanics have been cleaned up, I suspect the game won't have the same appeal as Fauna.  Still well worth a look though.

Picked this up because our neighbor has Fauna and we really enjoyed playing it as a light game. With teenage kids and always looking for games that will layer education with fun, this was a good fit for our family. Like Fauna, it can be a simple gateway game to teach non gamers, which we did on the first play because world knowledge is more important than game knowledge when playing. The only downside I can see is when you play through all the cards in short succession, like Trivial Pursuit, you can get someone that memorizes the facts on the cards. Fortunately we have so many games we like to play, this will be in rotation but it will take a long time before we cycle through all the cards in this game.

This game suffers from the same problem as Trivial Pursuit (and pretty much every other static trivia game), in that once you've gone through all the questions once, you know the answers... I like trivia, but these games get stale too quickly for me to recommend them.

Friedmann Friese is onto something with his Fauna and Terra games. They are ‘party’ trivia games for people who don’t necessarily know the answers. Following other players and being nearly right yields points too. The mechanic of the map and a couple of numerical options for guessing answers is excellent.

My family has appalling General Knowledge and hate Trivial Pursuit. They absolutely loved Terra.

Just a much worse version of Fauna. It's way too general and as I could imagine an animal I didn't know and still have fun guessing its size or weight, here in many cases it's impossible to guess a number value without knowing it. I mean especially guessing years - in a whole game no one even tried to bet on this track since it's almost impossible to score when you have so short time segments made (in recent centuries).

Map borders poorly are defined. We had several arguments about what is or isn't adjacent to map areas.

It's probably better in a classroom than a party.

I'm not a social gamer, and I don't enjoy 99% of party games because of it, but this is probably one of the best trivia games in existence since it mitigates the uncontested-skill(memorization of mostly useless facts) aspect of all the other standard trivia games.

A trivia party game which you can win by just making educated guesses as long as your answer is closest to the actual answer.

Like Fauna, but with things instead of animals. For example, the widest drainpipe or the first post office. Each card has several properties the players are trying to guess. One is geography: there's a world map that has broad location indicators. The other three possible properties are numeric and there are tracks that list ranges of values. One track is dates, with ranges getting narrower as you get closer to the present. One track is length/width values (one side of the board is metric and the other side of the board is customary/imperial). The third track is a generic number, the meaning of which varies by card. Three of the four values are used on any particular card. Players in turn mark a location/value. At the end of the round, the players who selected correct locations/value-ranges get 7 points and the players who were adjacent (on the map or on the number track) get 3 points. Players who were wrong temporarily lose their guessing cubes. The things you're identifying are obscure enough that you're unlikely to know them, but you can use your knowledge base and a bit of logic to work out reasonable guesses.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2016)

I tend to avoid Friedemann Friese´s games. Most often than not, I end up disliking them. This is the reason I didn’t even consider buying Terra, but to my surprise, I enjoyed the game a lot!

It is reminiscent to Timeline: Challenge (or perhaps it is the other way around).

The rules are dead easy, you can teach it under 5 minutes and the game flows easily because in each turn, all players are engaged. The art and game components are ok.

Terra is a trivia game (which I tend to like), but unlike most trivia games, if you don’t know the answer, you can still win. Many times you can deduce the answers or you can see what other players do and react accordingly. If you do know the answer, you get a lot of VPs, but coming close to the answer can also give you some VPs. It’s a clever system, it allows for some strategy (which is a rarity in trivia games).

Bottom line, I think I will buy it in the future and now I’m keen on trying Fauna. With more plays, it will probably get an upgraded rating from me. It was a complete surprise!

Replace Fauna with this. 

TERRA is a redesign of Friedemann’s 2009 SDJ-nominated FAUNA, which had similar mechanics, but was specific to animals. TERRA changes the subject matter to general geographic information, includes a brand new Imperial measurements map side (retaining the Metric map side for gamers outside the US), has 300 topics (with three categories of questions) on oversized cards, and simplifies the scoring. TERRA plays in 45 minutes for 2-6 players.

German edition.
We love Fauna. Not so keen on some of the simplified rules in Terra, and we miss the black cubes for correct answers. But that can be fixed ...
That sounds very negative. I like this game a lot.

Wits & Wagers and Trivial pursuit had a baby.

Game is fast to teach and easy to play and you can play this game with older people too.

Questions vary from really easy to "how can any one know this?", just like in Trivial Pursuit.

The questions always relates to a country or many countries in addition to two different sections like: length, year, height, weight etc. 

You don't need to know the exact answer, but you need to get at least pretty close to the real answer to get points.

General geographical knowledge version of Fauna. While the questions include a lot more variety than the latter, many of them feel that much more abstract which leave me guessing in a greater vacuum. I appreciate the freshness but find it a notch less interesting. Still, happy to play, and will try America as well.

For a trivial piursuit style game this isn't bad but still the questions vary wildly, making it a shame a full game only deals with six of them. More would make the game much too long though.

A trivia game which borrows heavily from Fauna. Since the answers are often related to numbers, heavy guessing is involved. The mechanics on top of the trivia and the questions don't add much to the game.

The guessing in Terra may not be as educated as in Fauna, but for me the topic is much more interesting. Some of the questions are just plain silly and almost impossible to estimate even close, but still I prefer this over Fauna. But I'm definitely saving both, great games as they are.

Terra is a trivia game in which players are asked to identify three aspects of a given clue--where it is, when it happened, and some numerical fact about it.  Beginning with the start player, players can place one of their cubes on either the map board, or one of three tracks at the bottom that correspond with the non-geographical aspects.  While players can't place a cube in a map region or track spot taken by other player, placing in a region or spot next to the correct answer also yields points.  I thought this was a neat idea for a trivia game, but the game was definitely weighted toward the geographic aspect.  Not only are there more regions next to the correct region that are worth points, a number of questions had multiple correct map answers (I saw up to 14), something I didn't see in the numerical answers.  I thought this made the game more swingy than I would like, and that the clue cards were all worth differing amounts made going first more or less important.  So, I enjoyed the game, but it's not my favorite implementation of trivia.

More abstract than Fauna. We like quiz games, so we should like Terra too. My little issue with it: some questions are too abstract to give propper answer. But you always learn something new.
-------------
edit:
sold, doesn't get us as Fauna or iKnow.
Questions are OK but they doesn't fit to Fauna board and Fauna answer system. 
Sometimes You get lucky with questions and put one proper answer on the map, rest of questions is too abstract to test Your knowledge

The best trivia game I have played yet. Incredibly underrated and overlooked. If you hate standard trivia games give this a try.

Pros:
* Clean graphic design and streamlined rules.
* Scoring for educated guessing allows you to stay in the game.
* You can score points by utilizing those who you think may know the answer.
* Plays quick and does not drag out like other trivia games.
* You learn something new every time you play.

Cons:
* If someone does not like to make educated guesses they will not like this game.

Another trivia game! Actually I prefer this one a lot more to the other one. Since you are playing with many and getting a lot of input. You don't have to be accurate with your answers / guesses but if you are close to someone who is you still get points. I think it is well designed simple trivia game. Very fun! interesting stats and amazing race helped me out a lot in this game.

Finally!  A geography game that is beautiful and well-designed such that it makes it fun for geography-buffs and regular earthlings alike,,, the board is large and engaging and the cards  and questions are both beautiful and challenging.  With only six rounds per game, you get a lot of replay value from what is effectively a cleverly-disguised trivia game.

A humanities version of FF’s Fauna, where play is about guesstimating the answers to tough questions and exploiting the answers you are sure on. The rules have been simplified slightly (IIRC), for the better: this went down well with wife and in-laws and - in what will probably be a regular ’thing’ browsing the cards for trivia after the game was almost as enjoyable.

RATING: 6
I read the rules and realized it was exactly a remake (on the cheap) of the great game Fauna.  Problems: in our first game--only six cards--one answer was "East Coast" which isn't even on the map (it reads "Northeast"), there was no demarcation between the Arctic Sea west of Alaska and the North Atlantic (where does the NA end? Hudson Bay, around the Baffin Islands?  It isn't at all clear), and the lack of proper answer markers (like the tiny black cubes in the original game.

That's a lot of problems for a re-do of a pre-existing game.  Wonder how many more we'll find as we play (e.g. does New Zealand extend barely into that sea north of it?).

Jogo que revoluciona a mecânica do acerta/ganha, pois aqui não é preciso acertar completamente na resposta, pode se ganhar sem nunca ter acertado em qualquer pergunta, desde que não se falhe por muito, ou se tenha "parasitado" corretamente a resposta de quem realmente sabia... Incrível como para cada cartão há 3 tipos diferentes de perguntas; Terra é uma grande ideia, numa grande produção que temos o privilégio de ter totalmente em português.

This game mixes trivia with wagering with some press your luck.  The great things about this game is that it's a trivia game that rewards for being close and there is strategy to gather points outside of knowing the exact answer.  One must be savvy with their cubes not to lose them to you have more opportunities for greater scoring at the right time.  This game is almost a sister game to Fauna which uses very similar mechanics but with respect to animal statistics.  For me, I find this game to be very difficult but it was still fun and educational.  This is also a little short than fauna as it is reduce to a only 6 rounds.  The educational aspect of this game is truly fascinating and my Dad really enjoyed this on.

A Faunán alapuló kvíz játék. A különbség a tábla színe és kérdések témája. 

Aki nem ismeri a Faunát: 
A táblán adott egy világtérkép földrajzi elosztással és három tippelő sáv (évszám, magasság/távolság, egyéb)
Minden körben a soron lévő játékos felolvassa az első kártya kérdését. Például a legnagyobb nézőszámú labdarúgó VB. Egymás után lehet tippelni a helyszínre és két tippelő sávon lévő értékre. Ebben az esetben az évszámra és nézőszámra. A telitalálat 7 pont, a szomszédos terület/mező 3 pont. Ha mindenki passzolt vagy elfogyott a tipp jelző kockája akkor ki kell értékelni a játékot. 

A kérdések 4 nehézségi szintbe vannak sorolva, és minden lap tartalmaz némi plusz információt a válaszok mellet. 
A kezdő szinten egész könnyen lehet boldogulni, de nehezebb feladványoknál már a kérdés is okozhat problémát.

An enjoyable trivia game, although this is largely attributed to my preference for geography and history-related trivia. Players take turns placing cubes on one of three answer areas, and score points if they guess correctly or close enough. If you think a person is particularly knowledgeable on that topic, you can leech off her by making guesses close to hers.

Some questions have very obvious answers which benefit the starting player, while others are more of a crapshoot due to their obscure nature – guessing population numbers of an empire, anyone? A few questionable questions aside, this is top-tier educational stuff.

Nice Geography based triv game. Great question set. Box WAAAAY TOOO BIG!

Still suffers a bit from Wits and Wagers syndrome... where poor trivia players can still leech answers off the more knowledgeable ones for 'free' points.

Also wifey pointed out that the scoring track can be a bit demoralising for players lagging behind... i.e. if in the last question your 20-30 points adrift, whats the point of playing that round... so maybe keeps scores hidden??

These are reletively small niggles though.

First Impression:

Simple Trivia game that actually offers choices. Now that's something. Trying to read your opponents and strategically place your "guesses"-cubes for points is a very simple, clever and working mechanism. The result is a game that plays super smoothly in a short time, offering fun to all participants and rewarding clever play more than trivia knowledge.

The bad thing of course is that as with all trivia games overplaying this will kill it's replayability, but as an occassional filler it's an excellent game, most probably the best of it's kind (on the level of wit's and wagers but better for me)

Excellent mechanics for a quiz game allowing you to score even on hunches and on reading your competitions actions. Also has a little bit more pull for me than Fauna because of the topic change. Plays well, even with stupid people as the mechanics fix all the annoying stuff of having to know exactly the right answer and the game dragging out that exists in for example trivial pursuit. Currently the best trivia game.

Very Fauna-like, but instead of animals the area of questions is wider.

The game is lacking the black cubes, which makes the scoring more difficult, if there are many areas. Also the starting player token is gone. These are comparisons to Fauna.

Sequel to Fauna with man-made stuff instead of animals. A good companion to Fauna.

But of course Bezier Games has managed to partially mess up the production by skimping on the components despite the relatively high price tag for the game, failing to provide the in Fauna very useful cubes to mark the correct answers.
Also, there seems to be many errors and inconsistencies.

Avoid and wait for an eventual corrected and improved second edition.

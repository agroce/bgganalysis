RATING: 5
Hugely disappointed with this. Leans heavily on mechanics used in other games but the sum of the parts don't exceed the individual elements. One of the hyped parts of the game is that it is strong on theme but this failed attempt to bundle things together didn't really make me feel like I was digging up sites in Mesopotamia looking for ancient coins. Instead I was moving a dobber round a map picking up cards and then pulling chits out of a bag in an attempt to get victory points.

Its kind of scary but I starting to realize that I am less of an abstract "pure" gamer than my girlfriend!

This game has been criticized for having too much luck in the tile pull mechanic. I disagree. I think it's fine as it is. The game is interesting, but the endgame has some drag affiliated with it, as one considers what the last actions are going to be. It's a solid game though, and fun with the kids, which is a huge plus.

Holy shit! What a fun game! Some many not like the luck of the draw, but really... what better way to replicate an archaeological dig? I like all the subtle moves one can use to position themselves, and the excitement of rushing to a site before others find all the artifacts. And it plays well with two... this is one of my favorite big releases of 2007!

Really enjoy the theme. The time resource mechanic is intriguing and the component quality is just top notch. But here's the deal: the game ends poorly. It is not uncommon for players to run short on meaningful options toward the end of the game. And as has been noted, luck can (and often does) win the day - meaning any strategy suggested is most likely thwarted by a lucky streak. I'll never play it again. Sold it.

Great fun.  An instant hit with me.  Lots and lots going on in a very well put together package.  When Queen get it right (about 50% of the time) they normally turn out a really good game and this is in that bracket.  Not only that, but this game is typical of their artwork and the general quality of pieces and board - excellent.  Many of the mechanisms in this are huge fun and I think it's one that's going to get a lot of play over the years.  It seems hard to go for the Exhibitions, but aside from that I loved the flow of the game and the balancing mechanism of turn order decided by weeks taken to achieve things is really good.  It's great fun playing "feely bags in the desert" - now I know how my son feels playing Laura's Star!  Parts of the movement mechanic (balloons and trying to save time) reminded me a bit of Around the World in Eighty Days.  But there's much more going on in this, and it's ultimately a better game.  If you think there's "not enough control in this," stop bleating and go and play something else.  This game is great as it is!

I know luck is a major fact in this game and that would normally lower my rating, but if fits the theme so perfectly that the rating will remain high.  The luck can be mitigated to some extent by acquiring knowledge, but will never be eliminated.  Realize this is a lighter game with an emphasis on fun and you'll probably enjoy it.  If you are one of those that hate luck and want every game to be meaty, you may want to pass on this one.

Best Turn order mechanic I think I've seen so far.  Actions taking x amount of time and then determining how far ahead in time that moves you is excellent.

Thematically the game is great and it's a fun play.

I wish there were a way to have the bag be less random, but even that ends up being fun and thematic.

Thebes is a very good push your luck game combined with route optimization and set collection. In the game we play the roles of archeologists excavating various regions of Europe and Asia in order to get prestige. The theme is very accurate in this game in all aspects, and I enjoyed it a lot.

It certainly have a lot of luck on the draw of artifacts in the excavation, but the luck can be mitigated well with more preparation and knowledge of the region you want to excavate.

There are some cool decisions you can make in this game, concentrate knowledge in one region, have sparse knowledge in all regions, focus on general knowledge, try to excavate early to have more chances of finding anything useful? spend a lot of weeks excavating to increase your chances of finding better artifacts, concentrating on expositions, concentrating on being the best in specific knowledge about all regions, etc.

I really liked the theme, the simplicity and the pace of this game, recommend to everyone.

I've played both the original version and the Queen version of the game. The Queen version is very nice. Overall the game is unique and very thematic. I love the time track and how it affects play. You always have to juggle time in everything you do. The digging is also very well done as well. Sometimes even with the best information you just don't find anything. Exactly as it should be. Excellent family game. One of my 9 yr old daughters favorite games and the 7 year old always wants to play as well. Has everything a good family game should have; great theme, nice components, easy to learn rules, relatively short playing time, and some luck to ensure the same players don't win over and over.

I have no doubt Thebes will become a "Hall of Fame" sort of game. You're looking at an investment of two hours playing time, but it is astonishing how quickly those two hours go by! Yes, the luck of the draw at the dig site can be painfully frustrating....but it's a good kind of hurt, you know? My only real complaint is that the English translation of the rules is a little opaque at times.

Ben congegnato e dalla tematica ben aderente al meccanismo di gioco.All'inizio è una gran corsa per "Formare" la conoscenza del nostro archeologo.Le azioni sono di 4 tipi ma bisogna incastrarle bene per cercare di anticipare gli avversari.Interazione indiretta piuttosto sentita nella pesca delle carte ricerca.
Il punto forte del gioco è la pesca dei reperti dai sacchetti...emozionante se presa con lo spirito giusto! (si spera sempre di riuscire a tirar fuori un sacco di roba ma magari sono solo detriti senza valore).
Il punto debole del gioco  è che la stessa pesca è fortemente aleatoria e quindi  ai german puristi che si cimentano con gli scavi potrebbe far storcere il naso.
In definitiva..buon tasso di sfida,molte risate,qualche delusione...ma gioco OK!!Ciao.:-)

It seems there's too much dirt in the game.  Every time I pull from the bag, all I get is dirt.  How else do you explain 6 artifacts left in the bag, I pull 11 and get nothing but dirt?

UPDATE: yeah, a bit long, and the tile drawing can be frustrating and doesn't feel as fun or like you're developing something like other games. A nice romp, but I'd probably prefer other options.

------------------------------------------------------

Pretty much very simple, and with a theme that is appealing.  I absolutely get that it's highly luck-dependent, but it's fun enough not to be a problem.  You just can't get too caught up in the "I played better I should have won".  The time-turn-order mechanism is very clever and tends to result in little downtime.  I enjoyed the game, even if I find it easy to get discouraged by the draws.

Jenseits and Neuland seem to have (independently?) given birth to the same clever mechanic of actions taking varying amounts of time and position on a time track determining who takes the next turn.  This puts players under constant pressure to achieve as much as possible in a limited time and beat their opponents to the dig/exhibition/source of knowledge.  There's a delicious tension around how long you spend gathering knowledge at the risk of being beaten to the first shot at digging up some artifacts.  The other systems built around this clever central mechanic all work very smoothly.  The digging is nicely thematic but does bring a significant chance element.  I find the luck tolerable in a game that I simply enjoy playing.  Queen has done a very nice production job on its edition of this game.

A light game with little to offer to experienced players, good to play once with your family. It is very heavily dependent on luck and even though it provides a few mechanisms to control the random factor, it still not my cup of tea.

Ok. Take everything I say as completely biased... my first career was archaeology.  I've spent weeks in the field DOING archaeology.  Doing archaeology is a much more interesting experience than playing Thebes.  But that shouldn't be a surprise.  What I like about Thebes is the randomness of the artifact pulls.  That is reality in the field.  Sometimes you hit the jack-pot other times you get skunked.  The use of independent time passage for each player is also a very nice mechanic.  Overall, Thebes is not my first choice, but it is a good game from time to time.

Finally got this after a quest worthy of Indiana Jones himself. Been out of stock absolutely everywhere but thought I'd have no prob at Games Expo. Found 1 copy at the show for 30 quid, quite expensive I thought but never mind. After my shift at the show was over, went to get it but it had already been snapped up. Curses! Asked at the Gameslore stall and they said they had a copy they could get for the Sunday. Excited, I put my name down. Sunday came but the game didn't. They had none left. Spoke to the lovely people at the Spirit Games stall and they said they had one at their shop. Tuesday came (closed Mondays!) and I piled the family into the car and said, right, we're going to Burton on Trent. So off we went and before I knew it, my daughter was clutching the box for me and my mission was accomplished. Played once so far, rulebook a bit tricky to follow but once figured out, it's a surprisingly easy but fun game.

I waffle between an 8.5 and a 9 on Thebes for this reason: I'm put off by the mammoth extent to which your digs are governed by luck, and by the fact that you could do nothing but fly all over Europe giving talks for three years and still come out ahead of players who actually dirtied their hands digging up priceless pieces from far away. At the same time, I love how true to theme all of that really is, and at the end of the day the immersiveness of it all wins out for me.

I really like the theme here, but I'm not generally keen on games that rely on too much luck (and Thebes is quite a luck-heavy game). It's got a good feel to it, the components are great. I like it - but I'd like it a lot more if it was a somewhat heavier, less random game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Components are nicer compared to the smaler card version of the game. However it takes more time to play and to explain compared to the card evrsion. Therefore the card version is preffered to play.
Provides several ways to get victory points. Interesting choices when to dig and for how long. Could be disapointing when there is only trash discovered but only for the digger ...

The theme fits this like an ornately crafted ceromonial burial glove. It does not have a huge amount of player interaction and appears to be quite luck driven but it has some great mechanics and ranks in the fun department. Now where are those Indiana Jones DVDs?

After having played a four player game I now think that I would only ever play this again with three. There is a lot of downtime in a four player game.

There are so many unique mechanics in the game that it distracts you from the fact that it's incredibly random.  Yes, you have the choices of what cards to take and how much time you take to do stuff, but there's a tremendous amount of chance here.

Somehow I wanted there to be a bit more to this. Pulling chits from the bag is fun, and rooting for others to get nothing but dirt is also fun. (Somewhat confused, I started chanting "Ra!" at one point.) The time track is less confusing than I thought it'd be, and there's less downtime than I thought there'd be too. A little long, though that might be different for our next play.

UPDATE: A slight increase in rating after discovering that yes, it is possible to play Thebes in an hour. UPDATE 2: Another increase -- C-- [i]raves[/i] about this game. That's gotta be worth half a point right there.

RATING: 7.5
This game has a very cool turn mechanism that allows players to take a different number of turns throughout the game, yet manages to keep the game moving and balanced.  This time based action is very cool, but can lead to some slow points for players that invest a large amount of time to complete a specific action (such as a long excavation).  The movement rules and card drafting are very clean.  The re-introduction of sand found during a dig make the next digs harder and really gives the feeling of artifacts becoming harder to find.  This game is a very good example of integrating mechanics with theme.  Production quality on this game is top notch with one exception - the dial wheels (which are kinda cool) are slightly off-center making them harder to read than ideal.  Overall, the game provides a rich theme packaged in a clean well developed game.  Sure to please a wide spectrum of gamers.

Random, theme-y, and fun. It can be tough to form a guaranteed victory due to the random tile draws, so keep that in mind. It's one of those games that always seems like it'll take a loooong time, but it breezes by once you get started (especially if you're playing 2p or 3p)

I am not generally a fan of games with this much chance, but I enjoy how well the archaeological "digging" aspect of this game can be somewhat calculated. I find this game to be really unique in its time/turn order element and overall thematically solid.

This is a fun little game.  Have to be comfortable with the luck of the bag draw.  This is one of those games that you play for the experience rather than to win.  Looking forward to playing it with kids.

Played this with a couple of 9 year olds, and they wiped out the adults.  Definitely a favorite theme for them.

Very thematic (great production values help - the little figures even have Indiana Jones like hats!), and the time track turn order scheme is a great idea.

Quite a bit of luck when it comes to digging (annoying to be the first to go to the bag and getting 6 sands...), but if you can overlook that a nice gaming experience.

Only one game so my opinion could change after further games.
Having turns dictated by who has taken the least time so far was a novel game mechanic for me. Needing to be first to each city to have the best chance of getting something other than dirt also made it not wise to simply stock up and head off to 'dig up' the most possible tiles.

I like the time track mechanism and overall feel of this game, but the bag draws are just too swingy for the amount of time the game takes, causing pure luck to determine the winner more than good play.

With only 1 play so far, I can attest this is a great game. It's got far more theme than most any other Euro-style game, and even with the heavy luck dependence, it just feels right.

UPDATE: I've found that I really don't love this game. It's way too light for me to love. However, it's got a great design, a great theme, and it's really easy to teach to other players. And it keeps you involved at all times. And it's fun. It's just not as immersive as other choices.

UPDATE: I still enjoy it a lot, mainly due to the great theme, but it's no longer one I wouldn't turn down. Down to a 7.5.

RATING: 7.9
As has been pointed out by many others.  A strong Euro bolstered by a theme that compliments the mechanics quite well.  Unlike other games in it's class there is quite a bit of luck involved, but not so much as to cheapen the experience.  

In this game players are archaeologist questing for prestige and fame.  Each "dig" the players go on involve actually digging through a separate bag of chits in order to find precious valuables.  Of course the bag is filled with useless junk as well, and each trip to the dig site will be more of a gamble (as the ratio of junk to treasure gets worse and worse).

There's also a pleasing way to resolve who's turn it is.  Players manage how much time they spend doing things.  Players who are particularly clever (or lucky) will often be able to make as extra move or two before their turn is done.

Beyond those nifty lil aspects, the game is a pretty recognizable set-collection type.  Reminds me a lot of Ticket to Ride and Tikal.

RATING: 8
Great theme. You dig for artifacts and then you exhibit them for victory points. The result of the digging will depend on the knowledge you have about the digging location and the amount of time you are willing to spend there, very thematic. It's a very light game, it doesn't have a lot of strategy. Works well with 2 players.

Forget all the grumble guts who say '...but I played the best strategy and lost, stupid game.' What rot (although I always think it). It's a game of luck (digging) that you can try and improve and invariable get sand kicked in your archaeological face HA! My wife loves this game too and although better with more it plays well as a two player. Describe this game in one word - FUN!

RATING: 7
Nagyon kellemes játék, meg van benne a szokásos gyűjtögetős dolog az ebből adódó dilemmával: 4 féle módon szerezhetünk pontot, de a témaválasztás és a kivitelezés miatt jobb, mint az átlag. Jók az extra kártyák (autó, léghajó, ásó,...), és az idő múlása is jól ki van találva. És végre egy játék, amiben nincs pénz:)
Nekem úgy harangozták be, hogy a szerencse szerepe túl nagy. Nos ez teljesen igaz, az utolsó 15 darabból 1 db volt csak kincs, fölényesen ki is kaptam:) Ezzel együtt szívesen játszom még vele.
---
A magyar szabályban hiba van szerintem, mert azt írja, hogy 3 főnél a 16-os mezőről indulunk, de azt is írja később, hogy csak 2 és fél év ilyenkor a játék. Vagyis szerintem nem 16, hanem 26 a helyes!!!
Más: rámentem 3 szín gyűjtésére, nem számoltam azzal, hogy nagyon nem mindegy, melyik 2 szín marad ki. Fura volt azzal szembesülni, hogy nem tudok kiállítást szervezni, a végén megnéztem, 10-ből csak 1-et tudtam volna megszervezni. Utána végignéztem módszeresen a színeket, az eredmény: a 10 lehetséges színpárból 5 olyan van, aminek a hiánya 7 kiállítást üt ki, és 5 olyan, amelynek a hiánya 9-et. És egyébként nincs aszimmetria a dologban, bármelyik színhez található két másik, amelyek bármelyikével párt alkotva szívást jelentenek. Tehát ha valaki nem akar szívni, akkor vagy legalább 4 színből kell gyűjtenie, vagy utána kell nézni, hogy milyen színekre menjen. Segítek: ezeket a színpárokat nem szabad kihagyni: sárga+lila, sárga+kék, narancs+kék, narancs+zöld, lila+zöld. Családi játék ide vagy oda, szerintem ez nagyon gáz. Ha totál ugyanazt csinálom, csak épp a nem megfelelő színekkel, teljesen mások a lehetőségeim, és ezt semmi sem indokolja, ha nem néz utána az ember (és miért nézne egy családi játékban, hacsak nem ilyen hülye mint én), akkor a vakszerencsére van bízva. Oké tudom, régészet, de tematikailag ez már nem a régészet része, hanem a kiállítás.

I like the way the turn order is working. That's quite original (I didn't know it in fact). But I have some objections against the points distribution in the pockets. For example getting an six or seven in stead of a one artifact is a big difference. I was a bit frustrated that sometimes you could collect with six tries you could collect about 3 points in total and another one let say 14 points. I regret the big difference in the numbers. Could have been a better game.

12/2/07 - One play.   Really enjoyed this game!   Interesting turn order mechanic done by time whereas certain actions take longer to do than others and therefore someone may have to wait a few turns before being able to play again.  Thematically it worked really well with the research/archealogical dig game.  I have read people who disliked the mechanic of "digs" as it is too random and you don't always get paid off for your hard work.  Personally, I felt that this made the game even better - though my score suffered a great deal because of it - as most real digs don't give riches beyond your inner most desires.   You have to work for it.   If it wasn't on my Christmas list for my family, I'd go out and buy it today.

Comment: original, never boring, but the luck can be frustrating.

3-11-2007: bij Spellement, met David Grietens en Stefan.  Goed voor 3 dus ook.  Weliswaar sterk verloren.  Had nogal op de congressen gewed, maar kreeg er maar 3.  Vegeet tentoonstellingen niet: interessant als je vanalle kleuren wat hebt.  Bedenkt dat je met witte boeken slechts iets aan kan voor zover je voldoende gekleurde boeken hebt.

4-11-2007: bij Alpaludismes, met Alain en Thierry.  Opnieuw drastisch verloren.  Nu niet op congressen gespeeld, waardoor één van de 3 alle congressen had...  Heb in de eerste ronde tijd verloren door te gaan graven met te weinig kennis.  Toch eerst meer verzamelen!

Good "gateway" type game - my Mum can happily play this one. Absolutely drips with theme. Winner will usually need to play well and be lucky and the tile draw element which can influence scoring hugely means not to be taken *too* seriously.

Edit: The more I play this, the more I feel that luck decides the winner (or at least a loser - there's always one player who gets screwed). Still is fun though.

[i]Thebes.[/i]  What a paradox.  On the surface, [i]Thebes[/i] is wonderfully rich and lustrous.  Mining below this façade can leave you feeling frustrated, empty, and unfulfilled.  How does one rate such an experience?

The time-track method of determining player order is novel and effective.  Imagine a long scale of action points, and every action you take from moving on the board, to drawing a card, to commencing an excavation requires points.  The person who is "last" on the timeline (farthest from the end of the game) is the next player to take her turn -- even if she just completed her previous move.  I really enjoyed this aspect of the game, and I hope to see it revisited in the future.

The game components are lavishly produced, and support the archaeology theme very well.  Players move between "modern" cities for research and exhibitions, and ancient sites in order to perform excavations.  Conducting research is accomplished by collecting sets of cards, choosing from four face-up cards.  That mechanic is growing tired.  I understand that it helps to mitigate the risk in a game, but it has been done to death.  Plus, there's an element of risk in this game which can't be mitigated.

That element is the bags which are used for excavations.  There are five archaeological sites, represented by five locations on the board.  Each site corresponds to a bag, inside of which are treasure tokens and "dirt" tokens.  Collecting larger sets of cards in a particular color allows you to draw more counters from a bag when you perform an excavation.  Allocating more action points to the excavation can also increase this number.  Yet despite collecting a large body of knowledge and devoting a lot of time to the excavation, you can come up empty.  In one game, I drew 10 counters from an excavation, 9 of which were useless.  It was phenomenally bad luck to be sure, but it killed my enthusiasm for the game.  In that same game, an opponent dedicated fewer resources to her excavation, and went 4-for-4 in finding treasures.  Argh!

There are other ways to score points, and I'd like to try an "excavation-less" strategy to see if that is viable.  Still, there's no getting around the uncertainty of the counter-drawing mechanism.  The exhibition "system" further rewards those players who were lucky with their excavations, fostering a situation where the rich get richer.  This game was wonderfully strategic and light, earning a solid "8" right up to those darned excavation bags.  Now I find myself wondering when I'll feel up to facing the potential heartbreak of future excavations.

An above average game, which I will play if I'm in the right mood?  That's the definition of a "6" on [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/profile.php?user=Beowulf]my scale[/url].  I might be able to dig up another ratings point after more explorations.


[i]Updated: 1/21/08, Rated: 7[/i]
{2P: 7, 3P: 8, 4P: 6}

It turns out that [i]Thebes[/i] doesn't scale very well.  My initial rating was based on a handful of games with four players.  The shortened timeline as well as increased competition for treasures made the luck of the "dig draw" an overwhelming component.

The game shines with three players, balancing multiple dig opportunities with competition for cards.  Sure, lucky draws still make a difference, but one or two bad draws aren't condemning.  The time factor feels about right with three players.

The game feels a little long when played with only two players, but it is still a better experience than when played with four.

Light, fun , engaging. Excellent mechanisms. Always Play With Mik Svellov's Variant (remove 1 dirt tile per dig). Good googly-moogly, the bits in this game are nice.

Just let me start by saying, that the luck of the game doesn't bother me.

The main reason I play games is to have fun, and part of that fun can be matching wits with other players, but a large part of it can also be matching wits with the game engine itself. This is why games like Shadows over Camelot and Lord of the Rings are fun - they setup difficult tasks that take planning, execution, timing, and luck to overcome. Jenseits is not a cooperative game, but like a cooperative game, much of the fun from the game comes from doing well in spite of the obstacles in front of you. In JvT, those obstacles most often take the form of some measure of bad luck.

I wouldn't want to play games like JvT all the time, as it can get rather frustrating fighting that uphill battle too often, but if I am in the right mood for it, a fun game like JvT is right up my alley.

Added 13/12/10: I have to accept that I have just have no luck when it comes to the excavation draws; my only wins have come from having more Congress cards and/or Exhbitions than the other players. Thus, never more than an "8" for me.

This is really a fun game.  I really enjoy the levels of skill versus luck in the game.  It is light, but it never bores me like some other lighter games I own.  Let me explain my use of this game at a game night.  

My favorite games tend to be heavier euros, but I personally don't like to play these types of games all night long during a game night.  I love to play this game before or after a heavier euro, which seems to balance and complete a game night for me.  When playing a variety of games, I leave feeling relaxed and excited to play more games later.  If I play heavy euros all night long, I sometimes feel a bit spent.  This game really hits the spot good spot for me in that it is lighter, but stratigic enough meaty choices to be made to make the game fulfilling.  It has a wonderful light-medium weight feel to it that sets it apart for me.

Most players will walk away from Thebes either totally enamored with the theme and mechanics or completely put off by the degree of randomness involved in carrying out excavations for artifacts and their victory points.  Players must juggle making the most efficient use of their 2/3 years of time with collecting the best knowledge cards, carrying out excavations at the 5 different dig sites before other players, and hosting exhibitions of their discovered artifacts throughout Europe.  Handling your time conservatively will allow you to potentially take more turns than your opponents, but neglecting to dig early enough might just mean that all of the valuable artifacts are gone before you get there.  The random luck (good or bad) of excavating for artifacts and lack of direct player interaction is probably enough to disinterest most "hardcore gamers", but Thebes makes for a fairly decent light gaming experience.

You will either pick up a card, spend time digging for treasure, reset the cards in warsaw, or put on an exhibition. You get points for treaures found, special knowledge gained, and shows exhibited.

Good game (=7.0), but for some reason it feels a little more fiddly (too many moving parts...) than I would like it to be.  Adding in the huge swings in luck, medium-long play time (my preference for longer games to have less luck), and the four player limit... I'm thinking that there are games that more readily fit my tastes in the "four-player, 90-120min" category

A great game where the theme really shines.  I enjoy the mixture of strategy with randomness.  Also it requires a careful management of risk-vs-reward.  The way that time serves as the "currency" of the game is something I've never seen before, and I really enjoy.  The theme is so tightly woven into the gameplay, and it really shines well here.  Interesting theme and great mechanics make for a stellar game.

One of my favorite things in strategy games is when they offer multiple paths to victory, and I really see that in this game.  I love that you can go after sure points or hope for the lucky points when you go after a dig.  But, no matter how you slice it, luck, is going to play a big role in who wins the game.  If you have poor draws you will struggle to be victorious, but it's still a very fun game and the luck seems to fit the theme well.

Thanks again to my 2007 BGG Secret Santa!

An excellent family game. Yes it is heavily luck dependent but that does mean that you can try and squeeze the best possible play as an adult and not have to handicap yourself whilst playing children. In the first 2 games I played , the youngest player (6 in one case, 7 in the other) won or jointly won. It is structured in such a way , you cant make bad choces just least good choices, so even the wildest play by a youngster will bring off some reward. 

Highly recommended with families , less so with serious Chess/Eurogame players.

Sure, there's a lot of luck in this game, but there's a fair amount of strategy as well.  I find that the luck can better be mitigated in a two player game than a three or four player.  I consider this a gateway game that is relatively easy to teach and fun to play.

A good game with slight balance issues -- collecting Congress and Specific Knowledge cards is a very good option rather than doing any digging.  Expositions seem a little too difficult to pull off, and not worth a lot of points when you do.  However, the time mechanic for play order works well, and the theme is very fitting.  Played with the house rule of leaving out the first dirt tile per dig -- there's a LOT of dirt in those bags!

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
The digging mechanism is neat in this one, but it really does make the end game scores a bit swingy.  Kind of has a Talisman vibe in the sense that you kind of need to decide when is the right time to start moving onto the next stage once you have built up some infrastructure.  Neat game, wouldn't mind playing again, but not something I need to own.

The bits are spectacular, and the innovative time mechanic is neat, but the luck of the draw for the digging is just slightly too much for me, I think. The luck is managed well, in that you can choose your level of risk (aka how many weeks to spend digging, and how much knowledge to accumulate before digging) but a person drawing 6 chips can still whiff, which just feels awful. Maybe its just a perception thing with me...

This is a very fun game.  I really like the timing used for the traveling and actions.  We played a 4 player game with the winner getting more points from digging than any of the other three had total points.  Towards the end of the game after treasures were already taken out of a bag he made four digs and grabbed high point treasures for each. He smoked the rest of us do to the amount of luck in the treasure digging; who cares it was a bunch of fun.

2 plays.  Okay game.  Too much luck.  Mostly a game of tactics (and limited amounts of strategy).  I seriously undervalued the "Congress" cards and the value of diversification in the first game.  Being the first to dig at a site is important (you get a free 1 pt. tile and the best chance of finding good stuff instead of sand).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A Treasure excavation game with the theme in the same vein of Pergamon.
The time cost payment seems similar to Olympos and Glenmore. Probably Olympos may have taken this idea from Thebes.


Set-Up:
(1) Each player takes a set of (a) excavation permission, (b) 1 archaeologist, (c) 1 time market, and and (d) 1 time wheel

Remove 10 exhibitions cards from the card deck.   Shuffle the remaining cards, draw 4 cards from this and place them face up in space provided by the board.
Divide the remaining cards into 3 equal face down stacks.  Shuffle 5 small exhibition cards into the second stack and 5 large exhibition into the third stack

This set up seems similar to some other games like Pandemic and even Thunderstone (if we wish to set up the traps and rewards).
Place the year marker on 1901  with 2 or 3 players but 1902 with 4 players.
Place Archaeologist on Warschau 
Objective of the game: Gain most victory points.  How?

Player order - the player who has the time marker is the last takes his turn.  But if stacked, the player whose time marker is on top take his turn
Movement of archaeologist and action execution use weeks of time.

Set-up only use the first stack and the second stack.  Put the first stack on top of the second stack.

4 action can be executed depending on location
(a) Take a research card
(b) Exchange 4 cards displayed
(c) Execute an excavation
(d) Execute an exhibition

When exhibit cards is drawn, place face up on the space for exhibition space on the board.  Draw another card.
If the card supply exhausted the first time, shuffle the discards together with the third stack.  Place combined stack as new card supply.

Execute an Excavation
Player has a valid excavation permission and has 1 point of SPECIALIZED knowledge - either from researcher card or found item
Special knowledge - technical books matching the excavation Area
Rumor and Legends from the people in the excavation area
Assistants
So there is special knowledge, rumors and legends, and assistance
General knowledge
Assistant cards can still be used as a single point of knowledge but will have to be discarded after use.

Cannot use more points of general knowledge than the number point of special area knowledge he has.

Move the time wheel and decide how many weeks he want to use to dig.  Weeks are represent by black numbers.  The red indicate the number of excavation tokens he can take out from the bag.
Shovel allows players to take additional tokens out from the bag.

Bonus for the first excavation in an area.  Players may want to see who does what and where they would most likely want to go to avoid competing too much.

What is the strategy of this game?

When a player crosses space 52 a new year begin.  The player turn all his excavation permission to the valid side.

Important scoring - congress cards and special knowledge (5 points)
Compare the scoring system with Dice Town.
Looking through the rules, this game does not seem complicated.

In a 4-player, it seems that I never got a great chance to purchase the best cards.  I wish the "cost" of the really good cards were a little more to help even this out a little, but I still had fun and definitely want to try this one LOTS more!  I love the "time" mechanic to taking turns.

With a couple of games under the belt I'm still slightly torn. The theme is excellent and ties in well with the mechanics but the luck of the draw when it comes to 'digging' seems to render a lot of the decisions meaningless. Still a heck of a lot of fun though - currently investigating variants that might mitigate some of the luck.

RATING: 8
Excellent archeology game with thematic mechanics. Time is your primary currency and you spend it drafting research cards (which improve your chances of drawing valuable artifacts from dig site bags), congress cards (which share a cumulative point system of their own), shovels and research assistants (which also influence your digs). Alternatively, you can spend more time at a dig site but there is no guarantee that all this time will pay off. You can draw 10 chits from a bag and 7 could be blank "sand". But thematically it works and even though it's disappointing when it happens to you, it's entertaining when it happens to your opponent. Once you have enough artifacts you can hold an exhibit for additional points. Highly recommend this game if you can find a copy. All cards sleeved in excellent condition.

This is a light game of competitive archeology.  Competitive is a bit liberal a description, in that the only thing that makes it competitive is that you're pulling from the same bag of chits.  No depth, all luck in the cards and what you get out of the bag.  I thought that there was going to be more of it, and it has not resonated with any of the people I thought would like it.  It was a gift from my 2009 secret santa, but I'm afraid that it needs to hit the trade list already.  No worries SS, I'll try and grab something that we'll like more than this!

Traded for Caylus.  Win!

Quite light, with a strong element of luck - however theme is great and it feels like you have control, like it a lot. Prefer the way exhibitions works in Jenseits von Theben, but the nice bits of this version and the ease of chits from a bag over shuffling decks of cards mean it's the one that gets played.

RATING: 6
For me, this game rates a 9 in two player and a 4 in four. So I think a 6 is fair, considering I bought it for multiplayer use. The 2 player game cuts down on the chaos for me and there is more time to ramp up to use some potential bonuses. I would consider playing 3 years in four players, as that might make the luck factor less frustrating for me. I will always play a 2 player game of Thebes however.

So conflicted!  The mechanics play so nicely to the theme, probably more so than any game I've ever played.  But the luck required, it's so huge.  The strategy comes in mitigating the luck, but you could be a horrible player and still come out with a victory.  Also, it encourages runaway victories when you rely on Lady Luck to stop them.

Still, haven't played anything like it before... I can see the appeal.

I abhor the drawing point tokens from a bag.  I can't bring myself to like a game that made me lose purely because of chance, not because they played better than me.

As a luck-heavy game that takes a while my first impulse was to give this a 7... but the fantastic theme and great components give this an 8.

I've since demoted the game to a 7 and traded it away. WHatever gameplay the game involves is overshadowed by the luck factor. I'm told the game works best with 3, but it's a pretty big investment for a game that can only be played with 3, no more, no less. I think I'd rather trade for something that can hit the table more often.

RATING: 8
Thebes is a very well themed game of Archaeology that combines a relatively unique time mechanism with the excitement of digging for treasure.

What I Like:
 - It takes a little while to explain the rules, but it is very accessible once you start playing.  Beginners will usually quickly pick up on the tactics they need to play well, and will be able to play competitively on the first game.
 - The time mechanism is great, and keeps everyone involved.  It is a little mini-game within the game to jockey for position on the time track so that you get your turns when you want them.  
 - Digging for treasure is very well implemented.  It's just plain fun to reach into a bag and pull out tokens, hoping to get treasure.  Since you throw the sand tokens you draw back into the bag and keep the treasure, the treasure sites gradually deplete.  This puts tension into the game, since you want to dig before everyone else, but you also want to collect enough knowledge first to make your digging effective.
 - The luck of the draw in digging vs. the control offered by collecting more cards is implemented very well.  The number of tokens you pull is influenced by the amount of time you spend to dig, and the amount of "knowledge" you have collected (you get this from cards).  So the game continually forces you to evaluate whether you have enough knowledge to make it worth it to go dig or not, and whether it's better to spend time on taking cards, or on extra digging.  This is where much of the game really happens, and it's a compelling decision.
 - The game plays quickly, and doesn't go too long - good length for the weight of the game.

What I don't like:
 - There is often a clearly optimal choice in the cards available, so not much thought required there.
 - It is quite possible to have no good cards available, no sites worth digging, and not enough time to both refresh the cards, and still have the next shot at them.  This is a frustrating situation.  
 - Continuing my gripes about the cards is that they are not all equally powerful.  In fact, there are some that are significantly better than others.  While I think the luck in digging is very well controlled by the game mechanics, the luck of the cards can easily favor one player heavily, if several good cards flip up at that player's location, on their turn.  This is the largest source of luck in the game, and is unsatisfying.  

Overall, this is a game that I am very glad to own.  I have introduced it to many non-gamers, always with very good results.  Personally, I doubt I will ever request it for myself, but I enjoy playing it, and there are many situations where it fits very well.

Quite  bit of luck involved in drawing the findings from the bags.
In some way the same as rolling a die, but here its getting harder and harder as you but back the trash bits.

Like the gambling part where you have to decide how many weeks you will do excavating on the site.

(1 play) This is a very light game which should appeal to casual gamers in particular. It has a lot of luck and there are almost no strategic decisions to make. It's also free of any direct player interaction. The components are simply outstanding, albeit the board being somewhat bland. Our first game has taken quite long (about 1.5 hrs), and the game doesn't hold up its tension for such a long playing time. Nevertheless I think that it can be quite some fun with speedy play and the right crowd. I should give it another go soon to come to a conclusive rating.

the instructions are poorly written, causing the first play to be really lousy.  we started playing it correctly half-way through, but it still wasn't fun.  it seems balanced and there are lots of ways to get points and it's non-confrontational, so i SHOULD like it, but i don't.  there's so much going on that it's hard to know what to do or who's winning...if you don't know who's winning, a game loses its tension.

Mike Pennisi is correct -- you have to have the right mindset for this one.  The luck of the draw is the determinating factor in the game; either you accept that going into the game or you don't.

This is simply fun gaming. With the luck element considered, this turns out to be an excellent game - thematically, tactically, and mechanically. It allows for some level of uncertainty, consistent with digging for treasures in the historical context. You can end up with a lot of dirt! However, this can be somewhat overcome by preparing beforehand to do extra 'pulls' from the bag so one can do extra 'digging' to hopefully find more artifacts (points). Tough choices ensue as more digging by your opponents reveals additional artifacts, all the while the clock is ticking. Can be a fun gaming experience for novice and gamer alike.

Such a pity that such a very fresh game is so un-replayable. Kudos to the author for coming up with such original mechanics. An interesting game play. Relates to its theme quite nicely.

Ridiculously luck dependent. The 4 cards that are turned up and the VP tile draw is quite random.
 
Our three player game score was 66, 65, 62. Quite close but not meaningful as random draws could easily make that difference.

Edit: second game was a blow-out. The winner doubled the score of last place. And it was ALL because of the luck of the draw. Blechh!

They designed this just for me.  Between the archaeology theme and the timeline mechanic, I was hooked on this game even before I played it.

This is one example of where theme makes all the difference.  If the theme were removed, I'd find this interesting (the time mechanic), but frustrating (the chit pulls.)  WITH the theme, everything makes sense, and I find myself immersed in the game.  It just feels right -- the pressure to get there before the other guy balanced with the need for research; the frustration of an organized, well equipped dig coming up with almost nothing, while some tyro without a clue stumbles over a valuable artifact; the resentment when you're stuck in Greece on a long dig while the guys back home are getting fame and fortune on the conference circuit.  Fun game, for those who can exercise their imaginations.

In many ways a great game. Clever mechanics, nice theme, lovely artwork etc etc. So why don't I like it? The digging mechanic is too random. Yes I have seen the debates on the forum about how this is realistic and good for new players, but it doesn't make me like it any more. If I wanted realistic I'd buy a metal detector. If you like games where anyone can win play Hungry Hungry Hippos. Why have such intricate (and well designed) rules governing your bonuses on different digs when the outcome of the digs is so random? For me it makes this game neither fish nor flesh and so it's not one of my favourites.

Have I finally found my antidote to Kingsburg?  Perhaps.  Ashar is hating this game right now, as she can't seem to convert her dice-mojo into any other kind of randomness-mojo.  I have found I've been gifted with "bag hand."  Both the games we've played, I've pulled good stuff, and plenty of it - like 20 artifacts worth!  Ok, my bag hand is so hot that it's almost making the game no fun.  At least in Kingsburg, it's close, which might be good or bad, depending on your point of view (certainly more painful to feel like you have a chance when you don't).  As a game, this one is nice.  The time mechanism is sweet, and the components are ultra-nice; I'm starting to love Queen for their components as much as I hate them for their boxes.  Plenty of strategy built around one very random element - basically, a game about trying to control and finesse the random.  We'll see how it fares if my hand o' the bag continues to dominate...

Who knew reading in a library, spending weeks at an archeological dig and giving a conference paper on your findings could be fun? Actually, it's not really. As an academic I appreciate the theme greatly, but it's so random that it can be really frustratng.

P.S. Because of how annoying it was to spend 10 weeks at a dig only to pull out fistfuls of sand, we removed 4 blank tiles from each bag. Don't know if this will break the game, but it's far preferable to feeling like you're just wasting your time.

Love the production quality of the Queen edition.  Digging tokens out of the bags is much nicer than the deck of thin cards.  The digging wheels are excellent.  I prefer the way exhibitions are handled in the original game, but this is still an excellent edition of the game.

I love the theme and the time track mechanism. I'm worried that the whole game comes down to how well you dig since you only dig a half dozen times in a game. I played with 4, so perhaps a 3 player game will even it out a bit more.

This game captures the FUN aspect of boardgaming as well as any Euro I have played.  Really and truly a terrific experience, and the luck of the expedition draws offers two very specific benefits - First, it makes it so that a rational human being can't get too angry, win or lose, because you can do everything right and still get hosed.  (Or draw 6s and 7s with next to no pulls and win... you just never know).  Two, the mechanic is the PERFECT randomizer for this type of game... the mechanic feels EXACTLY right.  Exactly.  You get something new every round, you move around, you get some laughs and excitement from the game mechanics... nearly perfect.  And - this worked GREAT as a gateway game.  (By the way, I do not usually use a lot of caps, so take those uses as genuine excitement.)

I had the unfortunate luck to pull 8 out of 10 objects from the bag on my first game which secured a solid, untouchable win. Huh? Winning entirely because of randomly pulling chits from a bag? I need to play this again... but so far.... what's all the hype about?

OK... I've played this now three more times and it is better than I first imagined. Probably because that first chit-pull has not been seen again. In addition, my wife loves this game, so that bumps up my impression of it.

Having loved the original I was prepared to dislike this edition for having the temerity to make changes. But, actually, I like it too.

RATING: 7
The Queen version of this game has the advantage that it basically works, while the original did not. The endgame freeze and the lame exhibitions are gone, along with some of the complicated end-game scoring - diversity is rewarded more subtly and cleanly now through a better exhibition mechanic.

So, the rather creaky original is now much cleaner and basically works. Is it any good? I'm not totally convinced. It's still hugely random, which may bug many (it doesn't bother me so much, and the game is at least fairly short). I think it has a better feel with 3 players than with 4 - the 4-player game feels a little truncated. The exhibitions are still a little dicey - they're all pretty hard to do unless you've already gotten lucky on your digs, especially the late-game exhibitions, and they don't offer that many points on the grand scale of things, especially when compared to their difficulty. The point rewards Conferences and high-value artifacts, both of which boil down basically to luck, are definitely somewhat out of line.

But, the game does basically work, the process of playing is fun, and it is unique and clever. The theme is rather well done (although as always, theme can be somewhat spoiled by weakness in the underlying game, which is the case here to some degree). I like it, and look forward to playing it a handful of times. Although it's clearly not a classic and won't have a ton of replay value, I expect it will remain on my shelf for a while on the combined merits of giving my game collection diversity points and having a nice theme.

I liked the rules of the original slightly better.  Luckily, I can solve that problem by removing a random 7 tiles from each bag before the game, and also marking the exhibition cards with a timing requirement to allow competitions for the exhibitions again.

Updated 7/12/10.

I just don't understand the appeal of games this light.  When playing [thing=30869]Thebes[/thing], I feel a bit like I'm back playing Candyland or Snakes and Ladders with my family as a child.  That's not so say it's a bad game--it's quite good at what it does--but my enjoyment of board games is usually about grappling with the challenge, thinking, re-thinking, learning from my mistakes, and reveling in a victory that feels well earned.  On that scale, Thebes is roughly the equivalent of watching television.  Colorful, entertaining, but ultimately vapid.  

The mechanics of Thebes are very simple: move your researcher (or stay where you are) and perform one of four actions: take a card, take a different kind of card, replace the available cards, or dig for treasure.  If there's much difficulty to be found, it is in squeezing every last drop of efficiency from your movements around the board.  (As if we didn't have enough games in [i]that[/i] genre.)  Otherwise, it's move, draw, and hope.  That's the game.  In light of that, the 60-75 minute play time seems far too long.   

I can see where Thebes would fit with some people's groups (and I think I can find a place with it with my group with four players), but it just seems sort of pointless.

The tension when you draw from the bag is great. There's also an interesting narrative arc from the early game where the bags are full of good stuff, and the late game, when the exhibitions are available. There's also incentive to go to a dig early, to get the free treasure and first crack at the bag, but the longer you wait, the greater your chances are of being able to get lots of pulls.

However, there isn't much to the game. The decisions are not particularly compelling, nor will they differ much from game to game, and the luck of the draw for cards as well as from the bags has a rather large impact on your result.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 2 players: Very unique game. There's a LOT of luck here, but luck is a big part of the theme and since the game only takes around an hour I don't mind too much. I really like this game simply because there's nothing else like it. The turn order mechanic is very clever. Plus, who can resist digging through little loot bags? Definitely a good time if you're in the mood for something light.

Tightly integrated theme gives this Euro a fun and interesting atmosphere.  Simple game play with one main strategic decision, how much time do you spend digging compared to gathering points at conferences and exhibitions.

Though light fare it is generally not suitable for young families because of the duration of the game play. The ending bogs down when most of the digging is done and you are recycling cards to find the last few exhibitions.

Everyone needs to play this a couple of times and most everyone will enjoy a few plays.  No one will want to play this hundreds of times, in fact no geek gets past a few dozen, just look at the play stats!  It has little repeat play value but, it is a good narrative.

Great little fun game that keeps you engaged up til the end. Good to play "with a glass of red" as my friends say as you see your friend pull 3 of the most valuable artifacts in a 5 week dig and you pull 8 dirt on a 10 week dig. Get used to regular gamers yelling out, "Stupid Game" and the dirt chant - ("Dirt, dirt, dirt, dirt")

It's not the luck that bothers me about this game, it's that it's boring. I didn't find the card selection very interesting, as it usually seemed somewhat obvious. When and where to dig is determined by the cards you have taken and the remaining resources. That's it. I never felt that I had any decisions to make.

Gorgeous, well executed, and rich in theme. If only playing well and making good decisions didn't sometimes result in nothing due to the luck of the tile draw. 

I love how people who dislike the game say things like, "I played the strategically superior game and drew more tiles, but I just lost." I know that's likely true, but I feel like I hear that an awful lot when people talk about this game. And yeah, it's true and it could be seen as a problem. But isn't that okay given the theme? I prefer to play this casually. 

The game is gorgeous and a brilliant design. I'd rate it higher if we played it more.

Rated 8 after a first play with four players. OK, yes, this is a very random game. But this is actually one of the better "push your luck" games I've played. There's enough going on beyond the simple token pulling from the bag to keep things interesting. 

The time track for turn order is very clever. The movement on the board tests a player's efficiency in maximizing actions. And, I'll be darned, it's just fun pulling tokens from the bag and dealing with the luck of the draw. If it was a simple deck of cards, it would not have the same effect.

This is solid family gaming. I'm not sure if this holds up over multiple plays, but I'm really hoping that this works as a two player game. We shall see.

Update after a couple of two player games--solid game. It's not incredibly tense, and it's not among the best two player games I own, but a two player game of Thebes is relaxing and fun. This is a great game for an occasional option for something different.

Update: Looking at my earlier comments, I can see that I was unwittingly foreshadowing the "been there, done that" aspect of the game. Five plays was probably enough, and neither my wife or I felt inclined to reach for this one any more. Traded this away for Dominion: Dark Ages.

We play 2-player, which takes about an hour and fifteen minutes, but feels a little shorter than that.  There is most certainly luck of the draw (both in drawing from the bags and in card flips), but if you are patient, the luck seems to largely even out over the course of the game.  The draw bags hold both archeological treasures and blank "dirt" tiles.  Any dirt tiles pulled are put back in the bag afterwards, so the more treasures that have been taken from an area, the higher the odds of getting dirt next time.  During the game, players become more powerful in certain colors, granting them more pulls when they're there, but with lower odds of getting good stuff.  So if someone gets exceptionally good pulls once, then they probably won't be too lucky next time.  So far, the exhibition cards haven't been a big factor in our games, as they seem to leave the game as quickly as they come in, before anyone has time to claim them.  You have to manage your position on the time track carefully, as whoever is farthest behind always goes next, even if it means one person takes several turns before their opponent goes again.  If you are drawing for treasures, it may be to your advantage to spend less time there (taking fewer pulls from the draw bag) if it allows you to go again, even though it decreases your chance of pulling treasure.  Overall, the game is excellent and works very nicely with the theme.  Also, the pieces and the artwork of the game are really nice, especially the draw bags.

Lots of luck? Yes.  Fun? Yes.  Don't think too hard about it or you'll miss the point.  
UPDATE:  I know I'm not taking my own advice, but I just played a game of this in which I went 0 for 9 on a tile draw when there were still 8 treasures in the bag.  Very frustrating.  Has soured me on the game a bit.  Down a point.
UPDATE:  I have the worst luck drawing tiles.  Everybody in my gaming group actually thinks so too.  I almost won a game with hardly any treasures (19 points worth), but was 2 points short.  It's nice to know you can compete without drawing tons of treasures.  Will probably stay at a 6

Social.
House rule from user 'fluxx' After digging for artefacts you have to spend one week for each artefact you found for analyzing and catalogizing... (This is to cut down the luck-factor a bit without changing the core-mechanic.) In exchange the game lasts half a year longer.

What happens at the end of the game, when pulling extra artifacts would take you past the end of the year?

you have to time your last digging properly - usually you try to have 1-3 weeks left for the case you are lucky. If you left 2 weeks and find 3 artefacts you have to chose two of them - the third one doesn't count (never happened yet)

Really fun game in spite of the luck factor.  Players can attempt to hedge their bets but luck still plays a role in the outcome.  However there is enough decision making and time management that players still have the impression they are in control.

I believe this was the game that started off BGG trading for me. Thanks Thebes!

This theme is so neat. There is a great luck factor in this game, but it's thematic and I love it. There is a great chance you will prepare for a dig and come up with nothing. Such is life. We play that when making a pull, if you pull any dirt out of the bag, you put all the dirt back in except (1). Thematically this makes sense to us that if an area of ground is disturbed, looking for treasure, there will be some soil that won't make it back in the hole. The way the turns work by utilizing a catchup mechanic for those who take less time to perform actions is really neat. Another unique one to have in the collection.

Just like 'Around the World in 80 Days', this is a good, well-themed medium-light family strategy game, where Lady Luck  occupies a crucial role. And, do you know what? I don't (really) care because theme and mechanics mesh so extremely well and everybody is the archaeologist of their own fortune in this game (well, maybe not always).

The player order mechanic is original (at least, I haven't seen it before) and works very well. Artwork and components are absolutely gorgeous (I like those chrono-whatsits).

All in all, a game whose hugely luck-driven mechanics are cleverly justified by its theme, which as an extra benefit makes it easy to pick up and is still quite a lot of fun for hardcore gamers. 

It does take too long though, considering its huge luck factor.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
What a well-themed game!

The thing that I like best about Thebes is the time/turn mechanic. You choose actions that take variable amounts of time, advance on the calendar...and then move again when anyone behind you on the calendar has already moved. Its possible to do 2 or more moves in a row, under the right conditions.

The excavation bags are fun, too. The whole theme seems really well integrated into the gameplay.

Its important to recognize that the game has a very large luck component. I can forgive that in a game that plays quickly and lightly, as Thebes does. But if the game is taken too seriously or begins to drag, the luck detracts from the enjoyment for me.

I'd play this any time and may consider trading for a copy some time. I'd really like to see the turn/time mechanic appear in a heavier, less-lucky game.

Thebes is a reimplementation of Jenseits von Theben, a charming lighter game that originally used card decks in place of the chit bags to simulate archaeological digs. I honestly don't see much difference between the two editions, this one looks nicer and is easier to get, so it would be the one I recommend for most.

In short, players have the choice of building up their knowledge base in Europe by acquiring books, shovels, and research assistants, or traveling to archaeological sites and digging away. The more knowledge you have, the easier it is to pull more chits out of the bag which makes it more likely that you will gain some of the VPs that are hidden amongst the dirt.

The chief scoring methods are either getting a lot of artifacts of high value, or or showing off a certain collection of artifacts (i.e.: 2 greens and a yellow, regardless of value) for a quick bonus.

This game was also notable for being one of the first to introduce the "time based action point" system where player actions have a time cost that is marked on the board. The person who has used the least time / APs during the game gets to take the next turn, so you can spend a lot of points on one big dig, but then have to wait a long time for your next turn (which can cost you: i.e.: if an exhibition comes up and you can't get there due to not having a turn come around for so long). This was also used in Neuland, and both of the original games, I think, were released in the same year. I find it delightful, and prefer it here of those 2.

A lot of the game is luck driven. The deck that dictates what type of knowledge is available is one of those, the other, more obvious one being the actual chit draw from the bag. Sure, you can load up on knowledge and have a virgin bag, but still end up drawing garbage. The game is maybe 33% too long for that to be totally acceptable, but I'm still largely OK with it because it fits the theme so well.

If you are willing to put up with some swings based on a tile draw, then I think this is a great gateway game. I am certainly in the mood for it on occasion, I just wish it scaled to 5 instead of the 4 limit.

Enjoyable with very clever movement rules, turn order, matching theme. Unfortunately, it's spoiled as a competitive game by the random card draws and luck factor of blindly drawing treasure from a bag.

Worth keeping as a fun family game rather than one to play with gamers. Better with 4 players than 3. Sold 2012.

I don't think THEBES is _nearly_ as thematic as many have made it out to be though- it seems like theme-deprived Eurogamers consider anything with something like the week-based timer or the archaeological digs in the game to be "rich with theme".  It's not any more thematic than most of the better Euros.  It's a fun, fairly light game that plays very much like those pre-SETTLERS Euros put out by Ravensburger, Jumbo, Piatnik, et. all.  I really like the digging part of the game although it is pretty much like a lottery- but it's fun to go try to dig up the last handful of treasures and then run off to Moscow to give a lecture before going to Paris to supply artifacts for an exhibition.  There's plenty of luck, some drama, and a pretty decent narrative overall. The components are very nice but for a retail price $15-$20 I could have done without the custom printed bags and eight rulebooks in various langauges.  I do think the game is a little too long for what it is (if it were 60-75 minutes it'd be just right) and I'm not a big fan of any kind of card drafting mechanic but for a light, accessible game with a lot of appeal it succeeds.

A great game if you can get over the luck aspect and just go with it and have fun. Most of the mechanics really evoke the theme well and I think there are ways to mitigate the luck factor although sometimes you just get unlucky. To which I say "Groan and get over it." I've actually always found the drawing counters from the bag to be interesting for the whole group as you all are watching to see which of the limited resources get taken (and enjoying the fact that someone else's bad luck is actually good luck for you). Lots of fun.

Spoke too soon on the 10 rating...just played a 2-player game and it is not as exiting (though still enjoyable).  The tension of getting to digs quickly for a better chance at finding treasures are nearly non-existent as it seems easy to focus on digs your opponent are not working on.  High points still remain: the randomness/luck factor of card play and treasure digs make each game different (though that is exactly what will turn some people away).

First play was 2-player.  Not bad, but neither of us completed a single exhibit.  I mostly drew cards in year one and half of year two.  Then I did a lot of digging.  Seems like something was missing.  Hopefully it's just more players.  Last play with 3 was pretty good.  Not too much sand!

The mechanic is really nifty as far as who moves next based on number of weeks spent digging/researching/traveling, but I just couldn't get past the luck factor of drawing the tiles during the excavations (yes, it matches the theme...no complaint there...I just didn't like the luck involved). I won't be buying this one...

Update: Shine coming off this one. The combination of only a few digs per player (each with a huge random element) combined with extremely tactical play limit it to being very fun pretty much only with kids.
-----
Was a hit with the fam. There are just enough research "options" for me to make choosing the development path interesting, without it becoming a card-driven game. There's also just enough luck that my whole family (even my competitive son) will fun no matter who wins. Turns are really fast, at least until the last year, when people start analyzing odds at each remaining excavation site, based on the artifacts recovered so far. A very interesting twist is the idea of the garbage tokens which get thrown back into the bag. Which means that the odds of finding something good at each sight [i]tend[/i] to go down incrementally for every token excavated.

RATING: 3
A conceptually simple game built around a nice timing mechanism reminiscent of titles like Olympos and Tinners' Trail hampered by two major game-technical errors: the vast luck of the draw in excavating, and the pointlessness of exhibitions which come and go at unpredictable moments. The luck of the draw while excavating is truly inexcusable: it may be 'thematically correct' in that you never know what you dig up, but it is certainly no fun whatsoever if a major dig you've been gearing up for turns up absolutely nothing. The game offers zero compensation for such occasions. Then the exhibitions: these take some planning to succeed with, but because their arrival and departure is also uncertain it is simply too much effort to consciously go for these. You should treat them as useful bonuses if and only if they happen to be easily obtainable.

In other words: seriously overrated title, to be avoided, even when primarily played in a family environment. There are other titles (also from Queen, if you value such details) which function better as a [i]game[/i].

Euro familiar, bonito, sencillo, original, pero el azar... uffff... ese maldito azar rompe con toda diversión! Toda esa preparación anterior para luego jugárselo en esas 'excavaciones' en la bolsa con ese dichoso azar!
El juego se hace largo para lo que es. Prefiero gastar mi tiempo en un juego que me aporte la satisfacción de que sé que estoy haciendo algo que repercutirá en el resultado final independiente del azar. Tengo buenos juegos que tienen azar, pero son más del tipo fillers que sabes a lo que juegas y se supone que este Thebes no pertenece a esta categoría. Creo necesaria alguna variante que mitigue ese azar como sea.
Lo aprobaremos porque tiene buenas mecánicas como la del orden de turno y el 'cronoscopio'. Pero a mí me ha decepcionado un poco.

our own game based on the movie. This game does it differently , but is well thought out and a blast to play. Pulling treasure chits out of bags has given us some funny moments. Put on the film music and relive the adventure. "Fortune and Glory" is next on our play list.

9.17.11 Played a game against myself. Found the time mechanic kind of neat. The scoring was widely different! One had a score almost 30 points higher then the other. To sum the game up, every move costs you time. The more valuable the move, the more time it takes. Eventually you go dig for artifacts and you can increase your odds with good play, it is still random. Once you have artifacts you can display them for bonus points. You are also able to try and go before congress to get points. You want to avoid specializing in one area as it will deplete and your bonus will cap out.

RATING: 6
Components: All-around great quality on the artwork and iconography. The board, cards, and artifact tokens are linen-coated. I'm especially impressed by the five color-coded draw bags, where the publisher could have gotten away with just having decks of cards that we needed to constantly shuffle.

Experience: Lots of fun. It's very tense, using up my limited days to build up knowledge, then racing to the dig sites. It's satisfying to dig for artifacts; the draw-bag mechanism works well to convey the theme. It's tough to know how much time to spend in both places, as it can be almost as valuable to just hang out in Europe as to go digging for treasure.

[Update]I've soured on this title. Too much luck; not enough thrill from the digging.

A game that asks you to be deliberative in your planning, only to hinge it all on the luck of the 'dig'. If the results of the dig weren't so extreme this would have been a winner for me, but as it stands I find it a unsavory mix of feckless strategy and protracted crap-shoot.

Yes, I know it has "luck." But there are so many "lucky" draws from the civilization bags and from the top of the card deck that I think luck truly does about even out.

My comments from the original version are shown below, but this new version adds improved art and production, simpler exhibitions, a wheel replaces the dig chart, and players pull artifact tokens from separate site dig bags. All improvements, for the most part. This game is now getting the recognition it deserves, including a Golden Geek Award for Best Family Game of 2008.

Desktop-Published edition:
"Wow, what a brilliant representation of a theme. Players are archaeologists competing for artifacts buried under five different dig sites. At the end of the game, players earn victory points for the artifacts they have found, the knowledge they have gained, and the exhibitions they have won, which then determines the winner of the game. Each turn the player can take one of four actions: move to another location, choose a card that corresponds to the current location, start an excavation, or pass. Much like Neuland, each action will take a specific number of weeks and the player furthest back in the timeline is always the first in turn order. This presents some interesting situations, because when one person goes for a high value card or a lengthy dig, they will move to the front of the queue, which gives other players potentially multiple actions before catching up and then passing the leader. Players collect cards at various European cities to gain knowledge of each dig site and to provide various special actions. If the player has the proper knowledge cards, an excavation can be made. During an excavation, the player cross-references the number of corresponding knowledge cards they have to the number of weeks they want to spend in order to determine the number of cards to pull from a random assortment. Cards will either provide Artifact VP cards or garbage that gets shuffled back into the deck, which means that each successive dig has a higher chance of pulling up garbage. Whenever an Exhibition card is drawn, it is placed on the timeline by the specified number of weeks ahead of the trailing player. Any player at the proper location at the specified time can exhibit their Artifacts. Players add each of a particular type or types of Artifacts with the roll of a die. The player with the highest total gets the Exhibition card, which is worth victory points at the end of the game. As I stated earlier, I think the game mechanics support the theme quite well; the timeline usage, the diminishing returns for excavations, and the exhibition of artifacts. Once you manage to decipher the rules, the game itself clips along at a good pace. The artwork and production in the Prinz Spiele version of the game that I have leave a little to be desired, but the new version looks to be an improvement. The game is innovative, well thought out, and it plays quickly. This is a really solid design and I highly recommend it. It is one of my top ten favorite games of 2004."

need to average 1 point per 2 weeks in a 4 player 2 year game.  Need to concentrate on a few types and get a good number of them.  Not worth picking up the 1 chips.  General knowledge is questionable when specific is available.  Need 3 shovels or none.  The distributed shovel with lots of digs strategy didn't work for me in my 1st game.  Winner did some high tile digs with high yields early in the second year.

In a 2 player game, getting a pair of shovels in 1901 before any digs was a winning strategy.

A surprisingly thematic game for a Euro. It does actually feel like you're doing the job of an archaeologist. The time management aspect of the turns is just genius. The major knock is that it is have heavily dependent on luck. Just expect that about a quarter or the time you will be hosed by unlucky tile draws and you will be ok.

At the first appearance, it feels kind of light, partly because it has quite some randomness (it however fits nicely with the theme), but on second sighting, there is quite some strategic planning involved. The randomness can indeed be pretty annoying sometimes.

Fun mix of resource management and press your luck.  It has a very cool an innovative action point mechanism that allows for actions of higher value while minimizing the possibility for analysis paralysis.  Very slick.  My biggest complaint is that the game is more fiddly than it needs to be (there are a lot of rules that don't seem to add very much to the game).  

I want this game to be simple enough for non-gamers.  It seems like it should be, but it isn't.

Good light Euro-strategy game and excellent family fare. Great implementation of the theme which ups the fun factor and my rating. If you're looking for a hard-core, perfect information, brain-burning, strategy behemoth then look elsewhere, as luck can undo the best laid plans in this game - that having been said I don't think luck is as dominant as some seem to think - the skill in playing is about managing the luck and giving yourself the best percentages.

Good quality components as well (Queen version).

Players spend time (weeks, basically money) acquiring knowledge and equipment to outfit their archaeological expedition to up to five ancient sites.  The sites are represented by five decks of "treasure" cards, that are also filled with a lot of dirt!  Time spent on site allows cards to be flipped and hopefully treasure found.  Points at the end of the game come from treasure, winning exhibitions, attending congresses (collecting a type of card during the game), and knowledge gained.  Belongs in the same category of "experience" games such as Safe Return Doubtful and Legend of the Lost Dutchman.  Very good, and really enjoyable game.  Played with "clear the board", "lots of treasure", and "hard excavation table" variants.

Queen Edition: stunning, lovely job.  Cleaned up some of the slightly messy bits - exhibitions are cleaner (no weeks offset or battle, just a sliding track and first there claims it); single assistants and shovels now do something; bonus for first dig at each site, etc.  Great game.

Fun, primarily due to the time track and variable turn order.  Lots of luck in the draw - almost enough to make me want to stop playing this game.  Much better with 4 than with 2 - with 2 it's a pretty unsatisfying exercise in reactivity.  Somewhat less replayable than I expected - not a lot of variation in winning strategies.

RATING: 5
Somehow worse than original, yet has amazing art and presentation. The race to good exhibitions has been replaced with a race to simply get there first and take it before anyone else gets there. Even more tactical and random than before, which removed quite a bit of the charm from the original Jenseits.

I like this game quite a bit, but I've played with people who really dislike the "luck" aspect (these are people who prefer the classic Eurostyle efficiency engine type game).  It doesn't bother me, as it's not really luck, but odds at play in this game, and it does have a fair amount of strategy.  Keeping tabs on your opponents is critical.  As far as game enjoyment, it is important to keep the game moving along.  It will seem too long if people take too long to take their turns!

Learn in Europe and dig in the Middle East. The learning part is lightly strategical. The digging part is just luck--and not luck that you can have fun managing or strategizing over a la Ra or Tigris and Euphrates, rather luck as in gambling a la slot machine. 

I suppose it adds to the theme. I really liked the use of the time track. More of an experience game than a strategical one. 

Normally would be a 7 but need to spread out my ratings to not clump every other game between 7-8.

RATING: N/A
● The best part of the game that I like was the digging part. You get to excavate for artifacts, and for this, what you'll do will be resembled by drawing out tokens from the cloth bag. There are artifacts and dirt tokens in the bag. You need to know how weeks you're willing to spend on the excavation spot. The longer you're staying, the better chance you get in your findings. To do this, you need to prepare yourself before the excavation by going to parts of Europe to study or to do some research about your location of diggings.
● These will be represented by the coloured books on the cards that you obtained during your stay at parts of the Europe. Although it seems like easy for you to take, going to places to get the cards will also required you to spend weeks for the whole journey.
● How does the week play any role you say. Well, in our 3 players game, game will end when the time track reaches 2 and a half year, that's 130 weeks. So every single thing that you do will require you to sacrifice some time (in this case weeks), digging, researching, etc. So you need to manage everything in under 130 weeks to gain the most VPs.

Summary: Not buying as I don't feel anything special about the game. This is probably because some of the mechanics from the game have few similarities from other games that I own.

After first play:

An interesting enough game to warrant further plays. The time track that works as a turn order is my favorite mechanic of the game. This creates a good amount of tension when deciding where to go, what to take and when to go digging.

Speaking of digging...I like the dials that indicate how long/how much you can pull from the bag. And pulling from the bag created some fun moments of everyone hoping the digger pulls 5 worthless tokens...Then seeing it happen!

Of the Queen games I've played lately (Alhambra, Escape, Treasure Hunter, Kingdom Builder and this one) Thebes is hands down the better of the five in my opinion.

Pros
+ Strategic and fun gameplay
+ Components are good
+ Playtime and pace is good (80 min for 4p game)
+ Enough there to satisfy a more seasoned player, yet simple enough for younger players

Cons
- a good Queen game, but still a Queen game and for me personally they've all felt just a little lacking so far.

Good game for families, would play again.

Not sure what people are smoking when they play this game, but I'd really like you to share it with me.

Thebes is a game I wanted to like.  It's got standard Queen production values (a good thing) and is actually quite thematic in the way its moving parts click together.  However, while I am not adverse to luck, this game is entirely a crapshoot when it comes to any strategy you might formulate.

In short, you gather knowledge in different colors and each bit of knowledge allows you to pull out more tiles from a bag of the corresponding dig site when you're excavating.  The trick of it is that there is treasure in each dig site, but there's also worthless dirt to be found.

Now here's the thing - you can load up on all the knowledge you want and all the possible bonus combos you can in order to increase your odds, sort of like a CRT in a wargame - CRTs generally can be manipulated so that even on your worst roll, you'll still come out on top or at least break even.  Only here, you can gather up everything to increase your odds to the very best possible chance of getting good stuff, but the sheer amount of dirt tiles in every site can destroy your investment where you put yourself at a massive disadvantage by shortening the amount of turns you'll get, walking away with absolutely nothing.  Among 4 players, this occurred SEVERAL times.  I'd be okay with the random poor draw, but for this to happen over and over again seemed wrong.

In this manner, you're better of simply flipping a coin and betting on the exact number of heads or tails - you have about the same random chance of winning that game as you do at winning Thebes and that does not make a very good game.

I'm not averse to luck-based games, mind you.  I quite particularly love randomness and chance, but asking me to invest 2 hours in a game where a good portion of it is strategy, but the end result is completely and totally out of your control?  No.  No, thank you.

This is proving to be a new favorite for me and my wife. She once dreamed of being an archaeologist and Egypt is still among her top destinations to visit, so the theme of the game is especially appealing. I love how the simple game mechanics brilliantly support the theme of the game. If there's a drawback, it's in the lack of direct player interaction. It's typical Euro-game player vs. system, so I can't help but wonder how it would play if it had some suitably nefarious nastiness to give players the ability to steal, sabotage, and discredit each other. May have to homebrew some variant cards!

Nice resource management game with a clever time management mechanism. Using the weeks as the cost for actions feels about as clean as a system can get -- provides lots of room for strategy and never leaves a doubt as to whose turn it is. Lots of fun digging in the bags, though my poor luck of the draw is on a par with my legendary dice rolls. Feels a tad long, but will most likely improve with additional trips to the table. After playing our first game, the youngest promptly went out and recruited two neighborhood friends to play with us -- always a good sign. He lost and still rated it a 9.

Thebes is a fairly light and highly thematic game where players are archaeologists traveling around Europe gathering knowledge, assistants, and equipment.  The turn order is based on who is farthest behind on the time track.

Once you feel you have enough to set out on a dig, you may travel to 5 different sites and decide how much time you want to spend digging.  The amount of knowledge you have garnered and the amount of time you spend will determine how many tokens you can draw from the dig site's draw bag.  Artifact tokens score their printed point values and may also be used later to score in exhibitions.  Of course, you also have a good chance of drawing blank "dirt" tokens.

Drawing from a bag that is half full of "dirt" is quite luck dependent, but players can mitigate this by gathering more knowledge, assistants, and shovels to maximize their draws.  The luck of the bag draw is acceptable to me because it fits the theme well.  Do you race off to dig first with minimal requirements and low chances of finding anything, or do you spend extra time to increase your odds but risk someone else looting all the good stuff first?  The choice is yours!  

Unless you are completely adverse to luck, I would highly recommend this game!

this is a really fun game - we have nickenamed it, 'digging for dirt,' because with 'x' tokens of artifacts there are 'x+1' tokens of dirt!  it is cool to travel to various ancient cities to uncover exciting relics.  the game, played in three parts, seems to go quickly.  it is a good gateway game - not too complicated; we introduced it to a few septagenarians, one of whom graduated from Yale, and they found it most pleasurable and fun!

2015-07-28 : Fast-playing game that rewards long-term strategies but where you also need to closely watch the tactical situation and what your opponents are doing. There's a luck factor in there, but clever play can mitigate that to the point where it adds to the game experience, not detracts from it. Very thematic game and easy to explain which are also bonus points.

Rating lowered after a subsequent play showed the luck factor to be higher than initially perceived. It's still a good game where every mechanic fits the theme perfectly, so I'm still liking it despite the luck factor.

(6/13) Only one play. Strong theme.  Fun to play but very chance-driven and random.  Someone else on BGG said "Let's just roll a D4 to see who wins.  Oh, you'd rather play it out? Okay." That's a bit harsh but I understand the sentiment.  Very interesting mechanics in this game; it uses a time track like Red November.  That's clever and adds a layer of strategy, but it still kind of boils down to who is more "skilled" at blindly pulling stuff out of a bag.  I'd really like a half-dozen more plays to refine my grade. (Yes, it IS fun to play.)

Don't play Thebes with a serious face... some game aspects can be repetitive, but aside from that it's good fun.

Ok, yes, it's hugely random. The lecture circuit pay-offs are ridiculously huge and it pretty much depends on being at the right place at the right time. The excavations are of course wild. 7-point artifact or 1-point artifact? It's down to pure luck.

I love the theme, the time track mechanic is elegant and intuitive. The digging mechanic can often have wildly extreme results. But you don't mind because the mechanic follows the theme so well. "When you stick your shovel in the dirt don't be surprised when you come up with a shovel full of dirt!" It's only a touch more complex then Ticket to Ride, so I think it would be an excellent "gateway" game.  

* Edit: Rating dips from 8 to 6. I love the theme, components, and mechanics. But. There is a lot of luck in this game. A lot. I'm tempted to say it's almost entirely luck. There are not multiple paths to victory in this game. It all comes down to luck on the digs. Collecting lecture cards and end game bonuses for having the most specific knowledge are no match for artifact points. It's a very fun ride with the right group, but this is definitely a game that plays YOU, not the other way around.

Juego aceptable y original. Cada jugador representa un arqueólogo que debe ir ganando puntos a base de ir consiguiendo conocimientos en diferentes ciudades europeas para luego intentar hacer excavaciones provechosas en  paises/regiones de gran tradición arqueológica. Es original en los tiempos de juego, pues siempre juega el más atrasado y vamos empleando semanas para adquirir conocimientos o mejorar nuestras escavaciones o conseguir contactos en las zonas a escavar; también es original en el modo de realizar las escavaciones, pues rebuscamos "x" reliquias dentro de la bolsa de la región escavada(eso remarca el caracter de búsqueda) en tal o cual región empleando más o menos semanas. Este segundo punto tiene un inconveniente y es que lo hace muy aleatorio el juego, pues podemos encontrar sólo escombros durante muchas semanas de búsqueda y uno que emplee poco tiempo y tenga más suerte puede coger reliquias de mucho valor; pero yo creo que eso representa en sí­ mismo la "vida del arqueólogo"
Para ganar: son muy importantes los medios de transportes(Un coche al principio de la partida te ahorrará unas 10 semanas en toda la partida que podrás emplear en otros menesteres); los conocimientos generales son buenos pero amí me gustan más los "ayudantes" que te dan conocimientos específicos de todas las culturas; a veces es mejor no moverte y coger lo cercano que irte muy lejos porque perderás muchas semanas (p.ej: sólo debemos ir a Moscú cuando haya al menos 2 cosas porque está muy lejos). Escavar primero te da más opciones de tener éxito. Acude, siempre que puedas, a escavar el territorio menos esquilmado o el que te permita hacer exposiciones.Importante las bonificaciones finales de 5 puntos para el que más sepa específicamente de cada civilización

Really a good game for people who get excited watching things being drawn randomly from a bag.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it myself, at least a little.  The rest of the game is pretty dull though - yes, the timing of when to dig has effects on other players, but it mostly feels as lonely as real archaeology.

Played it 5 more times to give it a fair shot to "WOW" me but it never happened. It's definitely an enjoyable game to play, and it wouldn't have been a hardship to keep, but at this point in the collection where pretty much all the games are really good, it has fallen to the bottom of the heap.

Got this in a Math Trade a few months ago and was super enthusiastic to play. It wasn't complete so when I finally got to play it was very exciting because I'd looked forward to it for a long time. It's a fun game with some great components - the Indiana Jones figures and the cool time wheels especially. It definitely is a light game with a lot of luck and not a lot of decisions to make, but I like it much better than any of the other Queen games I've tried so far. However, I also got a copy of Thebes:The Tomb Raiders in a subsequent Maths Trade and we like that one just a shade better than this. The other half thinks that Thebes is too repetitive - move, collect books, move collect books, for a year or a year and a half, then move, dig, move, dig for the rest of the game. I don't mind that too much because we do a fair bit of collecting in Ticket to Ride, but with so many other really good game options, this doesn't look likely to get played too often. It also doesn't have anything particularly unique to make me keep it in the collection.

The whole mechanic of digging in a bag for treasure is  very thematic and fun.  There are definitely meaningful decisions (do I play conservatively for points I know I'll get, or take the risk of digging in the hope of big points?), and although there is a luck element, the fun factor is very high! 

In one respect it could be argued that this game has a limited appeal - the rule complexity is too high for non gamers, whereas the luck element is too high for gamers.  It would be a great gateway game if the rules were less complex; a great gamers game if there was less luck - so it doesn't really satisfy either group.  It has limited replay value for gamers; non-gamers who make it through the rules probably will have a lot of fun with it however.

But for with the same group, it is a great family game: kids love the luck element, and once they have the rules down, you can finish a game in under an hour.  I've revised my initial skepticism - I don't think it will see much play as a serious competitive game for adults, because of the luck element, but as a family game for kids, it's great.

There is just one word for this game: fun.  Not heavy, but rich with theme, this is not a game to take too seriously.  But it is a blast.  You really get the feel for rummaging through the libraries of Europe and then heading off to the Middle East to dig.  The separate bags capture the feel of discovery for the archaeologist.  Really great game.

RATING: 5
This one was fun for a few plays early on in my re-entry into the hobby. The components are spectacular,  the time mechanism for actions is brilliant, and the theme shines through. It seems like a great game. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold up as anything more than a family game due to the randomness throughout the design. I've still yet to see the exhibits used much at all due to the way they come and go. I think a tweak is necessary to get these guys in the game. Fortunately, Martin Wallace used the time mechanism in Tinners Trail so that juicy bit is not wasted. 

After our last game, a friend suggested a strategy that seemed compelling: you stay in Europe the whole game and never go digging. You simply collect congress cards and load up in expertise in the various categories for endgame points. As these are sure things vs digging, you would rack up a lot of certain points. Never tried it, but sure sounds like the way to go, albeit quite unthematic.

Love games that have one resource that is also either victory conditions or other critical resources in the game that you have to balance throughout (i.e. crystals for Seasons, or cards in hand in Puerto Rico).  Really like how in Thebes, you are either taking time to research more or get to digs, but you have to balance that with pushing the game to it's conclusion.  The mechanics really fit with the theme, also the more a site is excavated the less likely someone is to find more items.

Es un juego sencillo de explicar y de jugar pero muy divertido, su tema está acorde al azar que trae pues se trata de reunir información para luego poder excavar. Lo mejor del juego es la acción de escavar, pues ese momento de meter la mano a la bolsa y sacar solo arena o pocos tesoros es emocionante, algunos dirán que tiene azar, pero ¿que excavación no tiene azar en la vida real? Escala muy bien y va rápido a 2 personas, mejor a 4.

RATING: 6
Great game with a theme that is extremely well integrated into the game. However I have downgraded my rating to a 7 after more plays because it seems like you may as well dispense with the first half of the game, where you run around Europe setting up for your digs, and just skip right to the digging since everything you do pre-digging can be undermined by bad luck. Perhaps there's no point in diversifying knowledge for different dig locations and you should just try to monopolize the knowledge for two locations so that you'll ensure good [or at least better] luck in two places.
[update]
Downgraded again to a 6. Perhaps it's time to investigate a variant that mitigates the luck factor. I want to like it more and it's still a good game, I'm just liking it less with each play. Might go with the "remove one sand after each dig" variant.

I would have marked it higher, but the luck factor in the draw bags was way too much for me. I liked everything else, especially the time track. That alone is a brilliant mechanism, it gives you lots of choice and it's nice for a game to focus on time instead of money as a resource. Some quibbles about the rules, but a nice game if not for the luck.

I really like the timing mechanism (if you take a move that takes too much time, you lose turns), it's really well-integrated into the game.  But the random tile draw aspect really annoys me, and I also hate the cascading conference scoring that ends up being a game of chicken.  It's clearly best if everyone fights for conferences except you, but if everyone except one player avoids taking conferences, that player will run away with the game.
So who wants to be the first to throw themselves on the sword for the others?  Yuck.

This one tickles the "Indiana Jones" itch, where you go careening around the world looking for ancient artifacts. It's a great light game with some good decisions to be made while playing. There's a rather large "push your luck" element thrown in, as well as some luck when you go rummaging around in the artifact bags. This is great gateway game. My wife LOVES this game. Anything that gets her to the table has got my approval too!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice contents, board.  Enjoyed the play.  The game mechanic I found unique was that time is used as currency.  The game lasted 2 1/2 years.  Travel & acquiring the artifacts costs time.  Efficient use of time will give you more chances to collect artifacts. There is a very sturdy wheel for each player that calculates time spent for the number of chances for finding artifacts.  I also liked the nice game bags holding the artifacts and dirt tokens.

I really like the competing choices that you have to make in this game.  You can't really say there's a single path to victory as everything revolves around the collective choices to which you must constantly adapt to.  When to go out and dig is the most fundamental decision required; the shifting risks versus the potential returns makes for agonizing moments.  I look forward to playing again and again.

I finally managed a victory in this god-forsaken game.  With two players, it's a pretty tight race for exhibitions and most special knowledge in each area.  With four, artifacts become much more scarce.  I have one three-player game under my belt, which may be the sweet spot.

There's a lot of luck in the artifact draw, but it's manageable: with the reference cards telling you the distribution in each bag, it's not tough to calculate your odds and figure out if a location is worth your time or not.

RATING: 7.5
Great theme, great fun. Highly recommended as a gateway. 

Even playing it as a newbie, it reminded me very much of Ticket to Ride + Alhambra. Set collection and maximizing time+location is the central theme to this game. 

The luck element - drawing in archaeological digs kept it light and fun. Every dig was a group event we kept highly interactive (house rule we learned from a friend: have other people do your digs for you - creates an interesting dynamic of blame/gratitude). 

Ultimately, though, it's the luck that turns both me and fiance off to this game. It's not just in the digs, it's in the cards that show up. I think I prefer it to TTR, but will only play with gateway gamers when heavy games are not an option

One great thing about this game is that half of the rules can be explained after the game starts as different kind of researcher and exhibition cards come up.  I may need to bump up my "strategic depth" rating, because there is actually a fair bit of planning to do if one is to maximize their potential for doing as many digs as possible each year in the most efficient way.  After reading many comments on this game, I thought it might be a total luckfest, with few meaningful decisions, but I don't have these sentiments myself.  When to dig in a given location can be a very difficult decision for which several factors should be brought into consideration.

A game this high in luck will never get higher than about a 9 for me, but this game is awfully fun, and gets very high marks regardless.

The strategy in this game is a bit light for my tastes, but the digging mechanic is very interesting. Many say it's too luck based, but that's the only redeeming quality for me. This game is about doing your best to control that randomness by doing longer expeditions with more information, so as to draw as many tokens as possible. 

While most of the mechanics are straightforward and even clever, it is very obtuse in a few areas. One example is the automobile versus the blimp. The Automobile card lets you travel faster and is always active. Meanwhile the Blimp is a 1-time use card. That all seems reasonable except that there is no indication of any of that on the cards themselves. I only found those rules in a little example box in the rulebook.

Ultimately a very interesting game that I think kids may enjoy as well.

Thebes is the perfect game-group game: A game that is wholly unique, something absolutely worth playing, but also only worth playing exactly one time.

Fantastic theme that is well integrated into the mechanics.  The time system is very innovative and really fits the digging theme.  As a game, however, this one is just too random to be much of a strategy game.  You can have a game where you spend twice as much time as the next player and pull out nothing but dirt tiles.  Yep, it is realistic.  Best if you just accept that the winner might not be the best player, and that is ok.  The game is a hit for the right situations.

Archeology-themed board game.  People on BGG like to bitch about the "luck factor" of digging for artifacts by drawing chits blindly from the dig bags.  Ignore these boring people.  That's one of the best parts of the game.  It's like pulling a slot machine.  It keeps people not in the immediate hunt for the lead interested as they always have a gambler's chance to get back in the game.  If you turn your nose up at this game, you need to loosen up.

Update: Having played this a few times now, I can see why people gripe about the luck, especially people who prefer the deeper games.  You just have to take this game for what it is.  You can play optimally on the board and still lose with bad pulls.  Knowing that may happen can dampen enthusiasm to replay a bit.  I'd still play it, though.  It's fun.

I have wanted to play this game for quite a long while. I expected everything given the complaints, namely that the luck of the draw overwhelms any sense of strategy or fairness. That being said, I think the theme is glorious and I was ready to win or lose based on the chit pull, knowing that some better pulls could lose to weaker ones. All part of the theme! Overall, I found the set collection of the game felt quite dated and uninteresting. Although the time track was probably the most interesting part of the game, I often wanted to play less optimally only so that I didn't have to wait an exceedingly long time for my turn to come up again. The option to playing more efficiently was there, but at the cost of getting cards that you want. Again, that's fine but it made the decisions rather limited. When it came to the chit pull, I was fine with the random luck - but there were so many blank tiles that it made the experience more frustrating than fun. Perhaps a variant could be introduced where pulling a certain number of sand chits reduces the time? Anyway, overall Thebes was a rather boring experience of a game. A real shame considering the great theme and quality components.

Great treasure-hunting game that's educational to boot (I learn what famous ancient treasures look like from playing this game :-)). Has a clever time-based action system that gives extra time for those who are behind, so there is no runaway leader problem. Cloth bags and very nice components round off a great game.

Thebes is a highly thematic game, with an interesting time mechanism (similar to 80 days) and offering an interesting balance between risk management and strategy.  Some will encounter the "luck" in this game as a negative, but it really brings the game to light in my opinion, as it nestles in with the theme perfectly (are any archeological digs guaranteed to produce riches? No, but the more research backing the expedition, along with the commitment of time makes for a better possibility).  Thebes is quite an outstanding game that scales well between 2 and 4,plays fairly quickly, offers good decisions for it's light to mid-weight and has brilliant production values.

My daughter and I play this game because we both enjoy the excavation mechanic and she always enjoys set collection, especially if the components look cool and the theme is interesting. I wouldn't bring it to an adult game group unless it were about 30 minutes shorter. It's a little too random for the amount of time it takes to finish and can feel repetitive after about an hour. My daughter and I often shorten the game to this amount by starting further along the time track.

Thebes is quite elegent and very well themed, with an exemplary turn order system.  I love how the action points players spend moves the game forward, and how it is always the turn of the player who has spent the least amount of points.  The theme of archaeological digs and the pinwheel prop tie so well into random token selection that it doesn't bother me much at all.  Each time we've played it Thebes has been a joy.

Rating based on one four-player game.  Thebes has a lot going for it, but I wonder if my rating will improve with continued plays.  Drawing chits out of a bag is somewhat random, but the "immutable laws of probability" plays its part.  There are other ways to score points other than digging, and a player ignores those scoring channels at their peril.

Wow is this game fun and the components are beautiful and very well made. It's a tough decion on when to stop studying and to start digging treasures. The time mechanism in game is just brilliant. But the best thing is watching your opponents spend a long time at a site to only keep digging up dirt. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone. There is just sooo much fun to be had with this awesome game.

Many thanks, to my friend Matt, who introduced me to this game.

Nice family game.The measuring of time is a little similar to the idea used in "Around the world in 80 days" and this is good. The only two things that bother me in this game are: time pressure (but with 2 or 3 players it's not that important anymore) and the randomness of loot.

On the other hand the randomness of loot is core of the game so I just have to live with it because besides that the game gives a lot of fun. If you are a family player - I highly recommend Thebes.

Acquired Feb 2008 - High "7" after 1 play.  Fun theme and some great mechanics for this Euro with a nice dose of "luck of the dig".  Yes, there is a large dose of luck of the dig in this game.  And it is often important to get in early while the digging is good (which in itself is a good mechanic).  Great casual game for children and adults alike.  Increasing to an "8" to join the other great family games, and because it's a game that is foremost "fun".

Believe the hype. This one is fun, with a capital 'F'. So few eurogames have a Theme that fits well with how the game plays, and this is one of those treasures. Rummaging around in the bags, really gives one the feel of 'digging' for artifacts, and travelling Europe in search of information and research to help discover more artifacts when you dig really sells the theme of being an archeologist.

It's more of a gateway game, though, and not one I would place in front of anyone who's enamoured with Power Grid, or Caylus, as the strategy to this game is managing, and minimizing your luck. Although, in all the games we've played so far, the scores are VERY close, even though many seem to point out that this game will suffer from the 'Runaway Leader' syndrome. I haven't found this to be the case at all, and it should be a great hit with casual gamers and families alike.

The kids love this. Just for digging in the bags, if nothing else.

I definitely want to play this again to see how it would play out a second time around. The logical pattern of the game is to collect knowledge, dig at sites, then go off to exhibit (collecting exhibit cards for victory points), but that's not necessarily the way things will work out. I found myself wanting for knowledge cards to dig at some sites because I threw all my archaeological eggs, as it were, into a single basket. I redeemed myself by collecting Congress cards for a nice infusion of points. The plus side to going after a lot of one set of knowledge cards for a site is that you are sure to receive the bonus for it at the end. The drawback is that you'll be lagging behind in terms of being able to dig successfully at other sites, which, in turn, feeds into your ability to nab the exhibition cards for additional victory points. You find yourself trying to balance the cost of your actions, the net gain of your actions and the future repercussions of your actions. It makes for some intriguing decision making and a thoroughly fun game. Interestingly, the player who collected the most exhibition cards in our game finished third in points. I would've thought he'd come in first. Ultimately, the player who dug the most won.

It's a really nice, high quality game for families.  We've played this 2p and 4p and in both cases it feels very straightforward with very little to think about.  My nieces and nephews enjoyed it very much, but it's not deep enough for us. Thematically it has several nice details.  We decided to put this one up for sale simply because it doesn't maintain our interest.

Daughter purchased with her allowance. Initial impression. Thebes really makes players feel as if they're in a race to grab the resources they need to loot the cultural heritage of other nations, abscond with their finds, and gain fame in the "civilized" world for doing so. While it may be historically accurate regarding the conduct of archeology in the period in which it is set, unfortunately this is not what I want my kids to think archeology should be. It also bothers me that "knowledge" is gained by reading books in Europe, not from the hard work of conducting a meticulous excavation. Furthermore, it seems unthematic that all debris is always returned to sites after digging. 

Mechanically, while there's a lot of luck in the game, it bothers me less than I feared. Having experienced the time track in Patchwork, however, I don't like that you can't look ahead beyond the four available cards to plan your moves—there's a designer's variant from the original JvT that we may try to address this. Exhibitions appear underpowered, and seem to be something you do when either it's convenient or you don't have something better to do (like dig), but perhaps this would change with more than 2p or more experience. 

At least as 2p, the arc of the game is anticlimactic. The first year has good excitement as you race to gather adequate resources to start digging when sites are fresh and hope for valuable find from smaller digs. The second year is more workman-like as you build up for and execute bigger digs that should yield good finds, but can only disappoint if luck is against you. The final year drags on as you try to eek out a few more points here and there. I'd say the game feels at least half a year and 20 minutes too long. 

I'm interested in trying some variants to address some of these issues, especially as my daughter seems to like the game quite a bit more than I do.

UPDATE: Played 3p for the first time. Positively, competition for cards meant that players were forced to adopt different strategies, so the game felt more varied than at 2p. Negativity, the game felt more random due to fewer opportunities for back to back turns. The game still felt too long.

It's enjoyable enough with the right crowd, but this isn't in any way a gamer's game.  There is a ton of luck involved.  I agree that it works with the theme, but that doesn't change the fact that there's only so much you can do to control your destiny.

[gameid=30869] has an extremely well-integrated theme. I'm not sure how one could better capture in a board game what it's like to be an archeologist.

A lot of people complain about the game being too random, but really, your risks are usually manageable. I think the reason that Thebes appears much more random than most games is because its randomization mechanism is unfamiliar. It's easy to see the odds in rolling a pair of dice, but the probabilities involved in drawing tiles from a bag that is increasingly filled with blanks are less obvious. I have heard many people say that the game's victory comes down to pure, wild luck; in my experience, this is simply not the case.

The game is so easy to play that it is almost but not quite a gateway game.

You move around from dig site to dig site and when you actually dig for artifacts, you reach into a bag and pull out tiles to see what you get. This mechanic really adds to the theme and is quite fun. There is a HUGE luck of the draw element to this game, but you adjust your gameplay according to what you get or need to get vs. what has already been pulled from the bag.

I am giving this one a conditional 7: on the condition that it is played with some sort of variant to how you dig (i.e., how you draw treasures from the bags). Currently, digging is way too random, and can undo any good strategy you might have had (or reward the player with the worst strategy).

What I propose is that you can only keep the 3 best treasures that you find in a dig (the rest go back in the bag). Maybe even just 2 treasures, if you want to minimize the effects of luck.

With a digging variant in place, this is a solid game, with a neat theme and a good execution.

Possibly my favorite new-to-me game of the year. An opulent production, an under-gamed theme, and simple mechanics that are brilliantly evocative of that theme make this one a winner. Recasting action points in the form of a "timeline" is especially clever. The game gets a little chunky in the final weeks of 1903 but I don't really mind. I have reduced my rating by half a point as I've seen the luck of the draw bag sometimes cast a pall on the game. A Cthulhu variant built on this chassis would be as right for me as Arkham Horror has been wrong.

An hilarious game for my wife and me! this game is not very strategic, but rather randoming. The progress is flat, sometimes boring. First year you collect knowledges, second year you dig, and last year you do expos and polish your majority points. In fact, that's when you dip relics into the bag that tension is at her height : don't cheat, shuffle and shuffle (and shuffle) coins properly, and put on the table your find... that resume perfectly thebes!A thebe's victory means nothing perhaps the end of some cordial relationships!

Stupendous beer and pretzels euro game for all the family. It has an very nice theme, the years of the great explorations in the ruins of ancient civilizations, it has a decent amount of luck to it, yet in the game I played we had a draw! And we did in fact pursue very different paths to victory: Peter focused on the treasures, I went for fame in expositions and conferences. 

I really liked this and I hope to play again!

UPDATE
Ok, I was able to play again, this time in four. I have to say that it is a little too random at this level. 
I think that this game shines with 2, max three players, not four. Because it is a longer game and you can explore more paths to victory that way. 

I overall bumped this to 6.5, but add 0.5 if you play in two. It is very nice and thematic that way. :)

Only big problem with this game is that I believe it wears down fast, if you don't play with all the family.

Very good family game, the fun of digging through the tiles and hearing the chants of "dirt!" from other players never gets old. Deciding where and when to dig is always a hard choice; do you wait unil you have a ton of research to dig with the risk of the other players taking all the good tiles early or do you go for broke and beat them to the dig sites. A very simple game that would be a great "2nd" game to bring out to non-gamer's after they want something more than Ticket To Ride.

Nice mechanic for turn order, using "time" as a resource. You move around spending weeks and collecting cards that will help you in your excavations, but these consist in drawing random tokens from several bags. The huge luck factor certainly fits the theme, but it still spoils the game for me. Too often you prepare yourself well for an excavation, dig a decent number of tokens and come out almost empty-handed. Then a player with less preparation and less time investment takes one or two tokens from the same bag and scores big. The problem is not only that half the tokens are worth nothing, it's also (and mainly) that the values of the artifacts vary wildly. Luck of the draw with the cards is quite significant, too. The game might be bearable for 30-45 minutes, but my experience has been more in the 90-120 minute range.

this one just seemed to strike a chord with me.  it's a game of archeology.  each player visits cities to research dig sites.  then they visit dig site and try to excavate artifacts.  lastly, if possible, players can exhibit their artifacts from the digs.  there are several mechanics that I like, some driving up the luck factor but very fitting for the theme.  There is a time line that runs around the board.  Each activity takes time, and player's move their pawns along it based on the length of time certain activities require.  The next players turn is whoever is on the top of the stack on the day that is earliest on the time line.  And the game ends once everyone as made it a predetermined number of times around the time line (twice, or two years, for a four player game).  

Each dig site has a bag full of chits that you pull out of its bag.  Some of the chits are just dirt and some are artifacts.  At the end of your turn, you keep the artifacts you've discovered, and the dirt goes back in the bag, reducing the odds that more artifacts will be found.   

giving it a 9, though it be the something-new-and-shiny effect.

Extremely thematic and a lot of tension when you actually go digging for artifacts.  You can do your best to try and mitigate the luck but ultimately you are pulling tiles from a bag.  In spite of that, this game works and has been a hit so far.  In the spirit of fun, it's great to chant "Dirt, Dirt, Dirt!" when your opponents are on a dig.

The game shines with a great thematic implementation and production. While I like how the game works, a look behind the scenes will show you pure randomness.

Even though I strongly dislike random games, this one can hold it's ground because of the great theme and production. If this was less random I would probably rate it very high.

Nonetheless a perfect family game as it is.

Wonderful game. Multiple paths, played very differently both times. Moves quickly. I didn't run into any bad luck, so it may take a hit if it becomes frustrating, but the joy of pulling a ton of points will offset I think. Plus I was taught by Stephen from The Spiel after listening to them discuss the game in their last episode. I felt like I was in a live podcast, very weird.

use Jenseits rules suggested in Comment comparing versions "There are several differences between the rules to Jenseits and Thebes, some of which can be incorporated into the newer version. For instance the original game gives a scoring bonus to the most diversified player, knowledge wise. Players compare their worst area of knowledge and the player who has the most knowledge in this worst area scores 7 points to the best of my recollection. (Knizia like scoring)
 In the original game 9 random cards (tokens) are removed from each dig site to create imperfect knowledge of what can be found and the dirt to treasure ratio is then also uncertain. I believe you could probably do this to the new version if you wanted.

 The way the exhibits work between the two games are totally different and cannot easily be integrated. Jenseits has cards which announce an exhibit, how far in the future it will be held, and what regions treasures are to be judged. On that exact date all players at the site of the exhibit would count their eligible treasures and roll a d6 to determine the value of their exhibit and the highest exhibit value would win the exhibit card. In Thebes you just show up with the required colored treasure and win the exhibit. The original version forces a lot more thought to win the exhibits so is probably a little less family oriented. 

I believe there is also a new type of card in the new version but this has little impact on game play. "

Yes, there is a lot of luck, but there is also a lot of fun. I kind of understand why people don't like this, but there is more strategy than you might think - clever play can mitigate quite a bit of the luck.

If you are one of those people, who feel that a game lasting over more than half an hour shouldn't be decided by luck, then avoid this one. This game rewards players who like good theme integration to the mechanics and the journey itself instead of optimizing your way to the final wooden cube or victory point. It's archelogy, for crying out loud - All the Sumerian knowledge in the world can't help you if you dig 5 meters to the left of the burial chamber... And then some wet-behind-the-ears-first-year-technical-student coming to a vacation hits a jackpot while searching for the best beach, which is also life. Besides, it seems one can be very competitive without going to the digging sites at all. Very nice components, especially the dials for digging.

Pretty good for a low interaction game.  Tons of theme for a euro.  Running around, collecting clues and exploring is a lot of fun.  The time mechanic, where time is a resource you spend, is really innovative and cool.  However, multiplayer solitaire is still multiplayer solitaire.  Such a small amount of interaction here, and it doesn't seem like there are many strategies to follow.  A lot of what you pursue is dictated by the state of the board and what is left to get.

RATING: 7
Thebes is a very accessible game about archaeological digs around the turn of the century. They go out of their way to provide background and pictures of each artifact found, even though mechanically they just do things like "+5 Points". 

The game consists of moving around to various European cities and doing research, then finally journeying to places like Egypt and Mesopotamia to excavate with the knowledge you have obtained. Optimization of your limited actions leads you to want to do lots of research first, but the game also strongly incentivizes being the first player to perform a dig. This tension is at the heart of the game.

The complaint that people make over and over again is due to the randomness of the digs, which can result in large swings of fortune. A single tile can grant anywhere from 0 to 7 points, a significant number considering that our first game saw 3 players have final scores within a span of 4 points. However, there are other effective point-scoring strategies that are far less dependent on these random draws. So ultimately, a player will decide how much of his/her final score he/she wishes to leave to the whims of fate.

RATING: 7
A fun light game with A LOT of luck -- and I don't just mean drawing tiles; just as luck-dependent is the right place/right time nature of the cards.  Maybe you could remedy that somewhat by having more cards to choose from at any given time.  It also seems that points aren't rewarded consistently in the game, for example, 5 points for a large exhibition in a 4-player game is not nearly enough.  It might help to have the points for exhibitions scale with the number of players.  It's a very cool idea for a game, and I love a lot of the mechanisms, but it feels about 90% finished.

My family and I found Thebes to be a very mediocre game.  I mainly purchased the game for my wife, as she enjoys playing games with my son and I, but she was showing signs of getting burned out on the heavier games we play.  From reading the reviews and ratings, it sounded like this game would be a nice change of pace for her.  And it turns out it is exactly that (thanks, fellow BGGers).

We found it to be a simple game (perhaps a little *too* simple for me), as it is very light and easy to play game.  And I have to agree with others that state that “digging for treasures” (blinding picking out pieces from a bag and hoping they are treasure pieces) is indeed fun and adds some suspense/drama.  And it certainly is easy to carry conversations with others (because of the simplicity) if you are into the more social aspects of gaming.  Also, there is a ton of luck involved.  That does not bother me (as I enjoy a mixture of game types), but I know others are more sensitive to this.  The positive is that anyone can pick this up and have a decent chance of winning (certainly a good chance of being competitive).

However, simplicity has its cost.  While I just mentioned a positive of the luck factor, the negative is that little analytical skill is needed for this one.  Sure, you’ll need to decide how best to use your time (“weeks”), but all in all, I found it not very stimulating on the thinking side.  Again, that is not necessarily bad for a change of pace, but not something I want to play often.  Another downside is, after a few games, I noticed that we would all pretty much play the same every time.  We would invest our time in picking up research items, and then someone would finally decide to rush down and do a dig, which would cause everyone else to hurry and do the same.  There’s really nothing necessarily wrong with this, as I think this is the nature of the game, but I found it to be a little bit monotonous in this regard.

Finally, I must admit that we have only played Thebes about 6 times – and we played those 6 games in about a 1 month period after our initial purchase.  Currently, we have not played this for a few months now.  While I stated some negatives in the preceding paragraph, even all of those combined would not keep us from playing it more, as we still found it fun.  I think the final thing to note – and the reason it has not been requested to play recently in our family – is that it takes a long time to play.  This in itself is not bad (for example, we enjoy rather long games of Agricola), but it *is* too long for such a simple game.  Perhaps it would speed up if we kept playing, but we were finding our games (of 3 people) to take around 2+ hours.

Wow. Queen rocks. This is much different then the original game and does nothing but improve the experience. There is still a huge amount of luck with the tile draws, but that is the game and the production values just bring up the enjoyment. I like the exhibition mechanism now much more than in the original version. Three cheers for Queen!

[Initial Impression: 6] 
A light-feeling exploration game with a well-integrated theme that I think would work really well as a family game. There are probably some interesting strategic differences of rushing off to collect artifacts early and often versus waiting to build up an arsenal of knowledge and then exploring only later, but I'd need more plays to explore that strategic space. The most intriguing part of the game to me is the turn-order mechanic - doing something good for yourself moves you farther along the turn order track, so other players may then get several turns in a row before you get another turn. This means there is clearly a balance between making incremental moves and larger moves with more impact. Not a whole lot of substance to the game, but it seems fun.
(Just to show the potential impact of luck: I had 12 draws from the green bag, which contained 25 tiles: 9 good and 16 "dust", and came up with 12 dust tiles - odds of not drawing a single good tile: 3.5 in 10000!)

Thebes is an innovative light Euro, with a decent amount of luck, but also with a  certain degree of strategy to help control the luck factor.

The biggest innovation is the time system which reset turn order based on time spent in actions- the more time needed to take an action, the longer other players will have before you go again. On the other hand, a single player who has been left far behind may manage multiple turns in a row.

Many different strategies for card collection are possible based on cards available (somewhat TTR-like draw system), sites dug/un-dug, exhibitions and opportunities.  

The randomness of 'digging' for artifacts in grab bags makes the game click with the theme, and it can add attraction for less-hard strategy gamers (like families, as above). I played the 1st time with my family, came in last and had a ball.

I liked it a lot, and might like it more with additional plays; it immediately went on the short list of games to take with us on vacation.

RATING: 4
The claims made about Thebes are a pretzel shaped argument.  The only reason the huge luck factor is "thematic" in this game is because the game is about archaeology of a hundred years ago.  There is no way that modern archaeologists would waste their time on a dig if there was a chance they would find absolutely nothing.  Digs are based on research and analysis.  They won't know what they'll find, but they know they'll find something.  So the idea that this game is "thematic" only works if you view archaeology from long ago.  And that's just a bridge too far.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.  And when it comes to Thebes, you're digging in a bag for cardboard pieces that don't depict dirt.  The card game version of Thebes, which admittedly runs far too long, mitigates some of the luck and is the far better game despite what other gamers have said about it.  The card game version is "less thematic," but that's only an issue if you bought into the theme of the board game.

This game has so many elements working forit. Dripping with great flavor, it's almost an archeology sim, but a very fun one. I love the 3 'sections' of the game - research, digs, exhibits. I have heard some whining about randomness in this game, but I don't think it's applicable here. Control freak egocentrics can play Chess and Go, and stop complaining about the random. In this game, the chances you dig and find nothing are somewhat realistic. The fact two different players can have a differing range of points with the same number of tokens, so what. Even studied excavators come up empty from time to time. In all, great flavor, well-executed game mechanics, and just enough chance to make it more interesting.

My only criticism would be that it's a little too luck dependent for its length. The drawing of cards into the table can really make or break the game for you depending on where you are situated on the board.

The drawing of tiles from the bags can make or break the game for you if your draw is extreme.

On the whole though that is not to say the game is without tactics or strategy. It is a very good game, very enjoyable and light enough to play with family/non gamers.

"...if only you spoke Hovitos."

An enjoyable, light family game as long as everyone plays in a timely manner.  "Stop the thinky!  'Thinky' won't make Tutankhamen's death mask materilize!"  The mechanism for variability of the turn order is probably the neatest trick in the box, and where most of the actual game happened for me.  Carefully choosing what to do to set yourself up for multiple turns in a row, or at least make your turn come sooner rather than later, is very cool.  And, just like in real life, if you don't know much but spend a lot of time talking about it you can become more famous than the person who actually does the work...

(Also, contrary to the rumors, "mummy-Jesus" is NOT one of the artifacts you can dig up in Palestine.)

Too random for my tastes.  In the game I played, one player drew 8 artifacts out of 9 tiles in the first dig and locked in the win.  We never had a chance after that, since he had the win locked.  Also, I thought the game went on much too long.  In fairness, we were playing with two VERY slow people and that kind of made the game unbearable.  I think Thebes is a cute game with a great theme, but it isn't deep and interesting enough for me.

The mechanic of spending time was cool but that's the only thing I enjoyed.  I find most Euros to be quite dry & abstract (mostly due to the scoring of victory points).  To me, this felt like a dry, abstract Euro with quite a lot of luck.

I bought this game to play with my sister who likes archeology but decided to trade it anyway.

Who can resist 'Lucky Dip' done as a boardgame? Plenty of luck in which cards come up, not to mention what you draw out of the bags. The only weak points are the exhibitions, whose criteria are hard to match and which don't really reward well enough to make them worth pursuing, and the conference bonus cards which are much too powerful unless several players collect them. Overall, great fun with a strong match between theme and gameplay.

First play Oct 11th, 2007. It takes about 10min to be taught and can play in less than an hour for 4 players. Each are archaeologists who did up treasure (victory points). It's played over two years and each action takes a number of weeks to perform. Spares are marked in weeks. Who ever is further back (time time) goes first. To perform a dig you need a permit which you are allowed one per year unless you get a counterfit one. Special action cards are gained in cities which you must travel to and spend "weeks" gaining those items. Knoledge (books) is also obtained this way and used to increase your "digs" per site. These books are found in each site color and wild (general). There are also special cards which allows you to move in less action points and assistants which assist in digs. When diging for artifacts (pull tile from a bag) you can find dirt and thus wasted effort. Before diging you decide how long to stay and use your wheel to see how many tiles you draw. There are also extra victory points for certain collection sets of artifacts. It's a great game with a decent balance of luck and strategy. I'd recommend giving it a try if you know someone who has it and give it consideration for purchase and placing with your games to play on a regular basis.

Only two plays in, one with the whole family and one two-player, and already a 9. Perfect family game or fast fun with two. Can run a bit long with 4, but worth it. After a couple more plays with four, it should get faster.

The theme and play sits right in our wheelhouse. Love the time factor and how it relates to travel and learning and then the race to collect artefacts. Digging in the bags is a perfect fit to the theme and accompanied by squeals of joy or groans of disappointment.

The end of the game drags. The bags had no artifacts left, exhibition cards were taken and we didn't need the cards anymore. I think 2 years might be enough for three players. 

2p game, much better. This time the game ended to quickly, we didn't even get to the exhibitions in the second pile. This game is much better than I thought, like to play again soon. 

played it with three again. it was fun! No problems with the endgame this time. I do not know what went wrong a few years ago. Glad we have tried it again.

This is a sound gateway game that uses some nice mechanics (time based movement) along with some frustrating luck of the draw (literally).  It plays well but is not exciting and does not beg to be played again immediately.  In the same category as Stone Age.  Don't know if I'm keeping this.

RATING: 8
This is a fun game.  I like the time track and how it determines who takes their actions next. There is luck in this game because you are drawing artifacts from the bag that always has the same number of blank (dirt) tokens but the # of artifacts decreases as they are found.

Still it is a fun game and the theme suits it.

quick game for 4 players. It might take the same amount with 2 people.  there is a huge luck component to the game with the drawing of the tokens when you do a dig at a site. The 4 different sites for the dig are slightly different on the point score. They have a different assortment of points so therefore some have one 6pointer while other have two 5 pointers and no 6 etc. As soon as one person builds up enough to dig at a site he might get lucky or not. I found out that it best to focus on 2-3 sites not all 4 there is noway you are going to get all the cards needed to dig for the other players are grabbing them as well.

Nice game that relies heavily on luck, but I'm happy to accept a game of Thebes anytime anyone would ask for it. As said, the luck factor may scare off some heavy gamers, but I love to see the faces of the other players when you're digging up 5 artifacts out of 6 attempts. Of course the contrary is true for the other players (how they smile when you don't get anything). Luck isn't the only factor though: you'll still need some kind of "strategy" to manoeuver yourself in a good position to start digging. Choices!

Unique and very strong themed game of exploration aka travel around Europe trying to dig up some artifacts. 

Components are excellent here and gameplay is FUN! where chanting "dirt, dirt, dirt" feels similiar to RA. 

BIG BIG luck factor here however all the 'pluses' this title has outweighs the negative luck factor. The luck and theme are really the game so accepting this is important to enjoying it. There is also some decision making here especially involving timing, what to buy, where to go, etc so this helps to keep it interesting as well. 

A great GATEWAY title for 2 - 4 that is easy to learn and play and comes in around 60 - 75 minutes. If my desire to play survives the 'honeymoon' it could go to 7.5 but I will usually go for a FUN game that is not decided mostly by luck

This game has an excellent production value and some interesting game mechanics. It reminded me somewhat of Around the World in 80 Days.  However, it is a bit too much luck dependent. In my first game, I drew horribly on my first draw from the bag in the first year and was behind on the scoring for the rest of the game and finished last. Another person had a great first draw and was ahead on points for the rest of the game and finished first. Basically we could have stopped the game at the end of the first year and other than possibly swapping 2nd and 3rd place positions nothing would have changed. It seems to me that the game has some design flaws.I played a second time, Luck rules in this game.

I've heard/read so much hype about both the original version of this game, and this tweaked reprint, that I'm glad I finally got to play it.

Sadly the bad thing I had heard about it, ie. the luck factor, seems to be true. I'd give it another try, but one side of the table in our play seemed to have much better luck than my side of the table. Wondering though if the fact that that side sat two players who had played before, while my side was 2 players who hadn't.

It's very surprising to see an Euro with such a solid theme. You really feel like an archeologist making discoveries. As for the gameplay, it's a bit random, but it's very fun! There is not a lot to "figure out", that is, after 1 or 2 games, you will pretty much know what the game is about; but that shouldn't stop anyone from enjoying this.

Based on one play.  Randomness is OK in some games, but in this game I found it led to turns where I'd spend 12 weeks digging to turn up all dirt, and then waited 10 minutes for my next turn.  I don't mind randomness as long as I'm having fun, but the digs just weren't that fun.

Raising rating to 6; 5 was a little too harsh given the neat manipulations one can accomplish with turn order, a characteristic this game shares with Neuland.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Aside from feeling like there is too much dirt in the game (at the end you are pretty much always digging up worthless dirt), this is a pretty good game, with plenty of strategy decisions and tradeoffs. My other complaint is that the final outcome seems to be overly influenced by the luck of the draw (whether you happen to get high-value artifacts, worthless dirt, or something in between when you "dig" by drawing tokens out of the bag). I prefer games where the outcome is less influenced by random chance.

Rating based on one solo play to get the rules right and one 4 player game (to date).

fairly lightweight Euro with some fresh mechanics (esp management of time as a resource) that is good to play. Game evolves as it goes along, with the draw sacks emptying of goodies and exhibitions coming more into it as the game progresses.

Docked a point from 8 for overstaying its welcome a bit - this would be a surefire hit at 60-75 minutes play time.

RATING: 8
I'm a big fan of the main mechanic in this game.  It's the same as Glenn More (a great game btw)...you essentially get to pick any avaliable action but some take more time then others allowing your opponents more turns.  For as good as the core mechanic is the digging drags this game back down.  While it may add to the theme of the game a bit it's very random.  A few poor digs can take you out of the game quickly.  To mitigate this we removed a few of the sand tokens from each bag.  This helped a bit but its still pretty random.  If you group doesn't mind the randomness then I'd say pick this game up.  Strikes me as a solid choice to play with pre-teens or young adults.  In fact, I'm surprised this game isn't dicussed more with some of the high profile gateway games.

Each turn there are multiple options available to each player and these decisions can be maddening.   Do I take a chance at a dig site or grab a card that I need for scoring later?

A fine mix of strategy and just the amount of luck that I like in a game. 

I should add that after playing the Thebes card game, I still like this a lot better.  The cards seem too random and although the rules have been tweaked a bit, the board game still gives more strategies. (I only rated it a 7)

Very thematic game.  One thing to remember is to not go digging up all the treasures of one color because if you can get at least four of all the colors you can gain more points off of the exibitions.

This is a beautiful game and with great mechanics. I like the traveling and time

RATING: 6
9/17/2014 - Those dig bags are seriously unforgiving sometimes. If you go into the game looking for a fun experience, willing to commiserate with your fellow archeologists over failed digs, you'll probably have a good time. If you go into it looking to win, you might get a bit frustrated.

9/8/2015 - Lowering my rating from a 7 to a 6. There are still going to be times I want to play this, but the downtime issue is going to keep it from getting to the table as often as a 7 would deserve.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game because the gameplay really matches the theme. The 'luck factor' of the dig brings an exciting element to the game, making victory achievable even if you have been 'unlucky' in your card choices. It's nice to see a game where mechanics evoke the theme so fittingly. It's a fun game that can have as much or as little strategy as you want to bring.

5.7.2010: I can certainly understand people who hate the blind drawing of tiles when excavating. Once I excavated for 9-10 tiles and just got sand, so it's really random! It didn't bother me too much, since it's supposed to be a easier family game and it kept the game from becoming too serious. I liked the game and wouldn't mind playing it again.

RATING: 7
Fine little game about traipsing around Europe gathering antiquities knowledge and then turning that into chances to unearth artifacts. Tiles get pulled from a bag and there is some set collection that can turbocharge your digging. Each of the ancient sites has a different distribution of tile values. 

Luck is heavily present in the draws from the bag. In my first game, one guy drew 8 blanks in one attempt, which at the time was quite unlikely. I don't mind this aspect at all, but be aware of its existence. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun exploration game that fits its theme really well. The luck of the tile draw when excavating can be frustrating but again I think it fits in well with the overall theme of the game. There are plenty of other ways to score points outside of large digs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Family weight archeology game with lots of luck. But also lots of choices. How much preparation for your digs and how long time will you spend digging? Go for one dig site or spread out to aim for exhibitions instead? Play this easy going and you will have a great time
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Light family game with nice fitting theme, which boils down to two actions: pick a card to help with the excavations or start excavating. The strategy comes from optimizing your actions and the 'time' turn order mechanic. The tension comes from 'digging': drafting tokens from bags (which can be frustrated by randomness and bad luck).

RATING: N/A
The time keeping mechanism really makes this game stand out. A rich theme that fits well with the mechanics. There's never enough time to do what you'd like, which is where the tension lies. Yes, there's a lot of luck here, but it makes sense with the theme. Very much a game for the whole family (well, families of 4 at any rate). Playing time may run a tad long.

UPDATE: I held on to this game for quite a while until my youngest was 8 and old enough to appreciate it. When we played, it went fine. The kids liked the  bag draws, but were less enamoured of the rest of the game. I think what ends up bothering me about this game is not that there is luck, but that you spend a lot of time working to mitigate the luck and then you usually get one shot each year and even if you set yourself up well, you can still get hosed. I kind of feel like the time and investment it takes to mitigate the luck doesn't always have a satisfying payoff and I could tell that my kids felt that as well. Today I introduced them to a more recent game in a similar vein, Fool's Gold, and they were MUCH more enthusiastic about that one. I think that while luck is present in FG, the steps to mitigate that luck are more straightforward and more in your control. For that reason, I think I'm done with Thebes. Still a good game, but for us, Fool's Gold does it better. Downgraded from an 8 to a 7.

RATING: 10
[>5 Plays]  One of my favorite Euros and probably the best integration of theme for a game with purely Euro mechanics. Luck plays a big factor in tile draws, but smart play usually (but not always) negates the effect. The time-based track is a great innovation and makes for some tough decisions on how to spend your time.

Incredibly fun game. Easy to learn, great connection between gameplay and theme, several ways to go about becoming a legendary archaelogist. Do you want to hire assistants, invest in more digging equipment, specialize or generalize your research, become more of an academic archaelogist or an on-site one? Do you want to go searching for more relics or exhibit the ones you already have in the galleries of Paris, Rome, Vienna, etc? There are lots of choices for players here. Probably the best thing about this game is the friendly competition in the timing: you can decide how much time you want to spend doing something, and if you invest a lot of time in a single dig, it may be a while before you get to take your next turn. By contrast, if you spend only a week or so in the library, you might get another consecutive turn. 

There is substantial luck in Thebes. Many of the choices in the game are about mitigating that luck, but don't go into this expecting good play to be rewarded above all else. I'm a heavy strategy gamer and the luck here doesn't bother me that much. I guess all I can say is that it seems appropriate and I still feel engaged in what I'm doing. 

I simply cannot think of a better family game. 

Update: I've lowered my rating for this because, despite the wonderful mechanics, I feel as though "I've seen it all before" when I play it now. Sure, there are a few different strategies, but choices are pretty obvious. I hate to say it but I'm going through the motions. Yes, the time-alottment and dig mechanics are as cool as they ever were, but now that I've "seen" it, I find very little to explore while doing it. 

It's too bad, too, because Thebes deserves a lot of credit. It's really the kind of game we all should have grown up with.

Thebes is a nice reworking of Jenseits von Theben and I pretty much agree with every change they made.  The components are much nicer (especially the time wheel), the exhibitions are much better, and it retains the nice thematic sense that made the original so charming.  At this point I will assign them the same rating.  I still think the game drags a little bit, especially for one with so much luck.  The tile bags are a really nice touch - it feels more like digging when you're actually, well, digging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Finally played the re-released version. I've originally played Jenseits von Theben years ago and, my word, the components have improved. It looks so much better now.

Players are archaelogists traversing Europe trying to either research or dig up artifacts. In comparison to the old version, the rules haven't changed at all except for exhibitions, which I think the old one was better at. Its been made more player-friendly for families most likely.

Overall I really do like this edition. Essentially the same game, but so much prettier and the theme really works for this game.

Initial impression after 1 playing, but so far, I'm very, very impressed.  The timeline mechanic is brilliant.  There is some luck in the excavations, but it's well within the spirit of the game, and players are looking at so many tiles during the game that it seems reasonable to suspect that it probably more or less evens out.  It's particularly nice that as your increasing knowledge as the game progresses compensates for the diminishing quality of the finds remaining in the bags.  Components are top-notch and component design makes the game easy and intuitive to learn and play.

All of the positive pieces should be obvious...the niggle, the "luck-factor" of pulling from the bag, seems not to fit in an otherwise sound design.

Solid family friendly game with lots of flavor. Theme and game mechanic integrate exceptionally well.

One of the best turn systems I've seen.  It's based on time (weeks).  If you take an action that takes many weeks, other players will who take several small time-consuming actions can go several times before you go again.

Only player iteraction is beating them to the punch, making it a race.

Several scoring mechanisms involved give what could be very simplistic extra depth.  Unfortunately the game still relies on luck of the draw in both cards and archeological digs.  These risk can be mitigated through proper play, but can be very frustrating to watch someone draw a 7VP tile from a small time investment dig while you pull nothing but dirt from a larger investment of time.

You know, I'm a guy that usually likes a luck factor in games. Got to admit, though, that I haven't entirely conviced myself that the overwhelming randomness in drawing goodies out of the bags doesn't drive this game right across that fine line between "a bit of luck keeps it interesting" and "oh my god, it's so random, why do I even bother playing it?"

All that said, though, it's a fun game to play, and maybe enough so to make me not care about the whole "I got a rock" issue.

Bought August 2007. Plays very well with two. Wonderful theme, and really simple rules. Decisions, not so much. Looking forward to see how different it is with three and four players, very much I suspect. Glad I got it!

On two players vs. more: Game works well with two, but rather often both players will get to 12 knowledge in several civilizations within the second year, and so it comes down to who "empties" certain digsites first. Also, the tension in timing which cards to pick up is much less as you can plan your moves to a quite high degree. Some people seem to prefer it that way, though.

For a German-style game this actually has some atmosphere that fits the mechanics; digging in the bags and the passage of time.  Unfortunately the passage of time mechanism seems to lead to a lot of down time where planning isn't very useful.  Further plays will tell.

Presentación espectacular, tema bien pegado y atrayente y una mezcla de planificación y azar (justificado: nadie te asegura nunca el valor de lo que saques de una excavación arqueológica; ni siquiera si encontrarás algo) bastante acertada. Muy curioso el sistema de juego que prima al que menos tiempo emplea y te hace pensarte la idoneidad de excavaciones muy duraderas en el tiempo. Los cronoscopios, además, son una gozada (¡si no lo digo, reviento!)

We've only played with 2 so far, but it's been enjoyable. Yes: there is some luck factor in the pulls from the bag. Did it hurt the fun or the planning? Not really. We've both won a few, so this one isn't wired exclusively for either of our brains. Cool.

After one game Thebes looks to be the ultimate gateway/familygame

There is a big dose of luck involved in the game and this will decide games if players are of equal skill. Besides the high luck factor there are some nice strategic options to be made.

I'm not sure about the scoring of the general knowledge in each area. 5 points is a lot of points. Probably one you can't make up when you go digging in the final weeks of the year. 
I have to see this in a 4P game

Looks like I will play this a couple of times.

Far too much randomness for a game of this length/complexity. Sure you can mitigate the luck of the bag draws but then you're wasting time not doing other things and it often isn't enough anyway.

Seems more luckish than it actually is.  Although it definitely has a lot of luck.  Luck on getting a bunch of things up top to come up where you are so you don't have to move around a lot is a big help.  Also, of course, what artifacts you draw.

A little boring, and not that much to it.  But also better than many other games, so probably something I'll play pretty often.

RATING: 8
A highly thematic game of archaeological treasure hunting.   Be warned that there is randomness involved with digging for treasure so if you're a high on skill and low on luck type of gamer, this probably won't be for you.  I find it fun to play once in awhile with the right crowd and the production quality and artwork from the Queen 2007 edition was outstanding.  A highly suggested variant that many play with is:  Every time an evacuation produces at least one dirt token, permanently remove 1 of those dirt tokens from the game (at that location).

RATING: 7
Just know that going into this game, there will be a significant amount of luck involved and at least someone will get messed over in the archaeological dig aspect of the draw bags where you draw much more dirt than treasure.  I've seen draws where 9 pieces of dirt came out with one book of general knowledge in a dig and that's a lot of weeks your losing to no effect.  The turn order mechanism is novel in that one keeps taking turns until one passes someone else on the week track completing tasks.  Points are given for most knowledge, each artifact found, lectures, and museum shows.  This version is a definite improvement over the original game which was titled Jesuits Von Theben.  I find that this game needs to be completed in 45-55 minutes or I start getting bored.  With so much luck of the dig in this game, I quickly tire of the game if people think too much!...:-)

RATING: 6.5
This game is a good resource (time) management game for the family, with probabilities/luck involved.  Theme is well integrated in the mechanics (luck plays a role in a dig; it's easier to find interesting stuff when you learned about the region, and when nobody has explored it yet;...).  Original turn system (a player can make plans for the 3 months ahead, but then has to wait until all the other players use these 3 months).  Simple to learn.  The scoring system is simple and makes sense.  Tactics can be relatively straightforward if you know about probabilities (getting an estimate for how much points you can get by spending your time in a given way is quite simple).  Luck can compensate for some of the difference in skills between players (but skill is useful, at least when playing against beginners).  The luck factor adds ambiance to the game ("I can't believe I found nothing in 5 weeks of digging!").  Nice board, cards, and tokens.

Great game, the luck is an extra fun factor in this game, the theme and concept really fits well ! I can only see one little downside and that is the color combinations of the expositions, some are way better than others, and green+orange is probably the worst combination to have lots of artifacts of.

The box might be a bit high, but the components are very high quality, and cheap (especially for Queen Games) !

RATING: 4
My first play of Thebes left me lukewarm. Who would have thunk a game about going to libraries and collecting books would be fun, but I liked it despite some major shortcomings. The big aspect I liked was how time was the currency in the game. I had read about this in the past and couldn't fathom how it would work. Well it worked very well. I especially liked that turn order changed based on who was furthest back on the time line.

The short-comings of the game include the digs and the available cards, which can really screw you or help you. Digging was especially disappointing when you get a handful of dirt.

Having played the game a second time, it left me cold. I like that the game makes sense and sticks close to its theme, but there is no tension. I never think about a move for very long as choices seem very simple to me: choose a location close to where you are that reaps the greatest rewards.

Although I decry the game for being too simple, I also think it is too complex for non-gamers that are not already familiar with these types of games. Figure that one out.

[u]Result[/u]: I would rather play Arkadia, which I mention because I almost traded Arkadia for Thebes.

RATING: 7
I had been eyeing Thebes as another attractive, middle-weight game for us, particularly since it was praised as a highly thematic Euro game. We were able to get a copy in a trade and were eager to try it out.

Although the time dials are a fantastic component, the board and other markers are a little lackluster. The board in particular appeared to be pretty drab, especially considering the theme (hunting archaeological artifacts). Luckily, the game is more fun than the components would suggest and it was a good time to go travel across Europe collecting knowledge before committing to a dig. As scientists, we enjoyed the Congress and Exhibition cards (gotta go to those academic conferences to get your name out there). The time track is a nice way of determining play order and we found it amusing that there was a generally a rush to get all of your digging done in the fourth quarter at the end of the year, just like at work!

That being said, while Thebes works as a two player game and we enjoyed it, I think it would work better with more. With two, there's not quite enough tension in grabbing knowledge and in getting to a dig before the other player---with more players, there would likely be more competition for both of those. There is a great deal of luck in drawing the treasures and this may be exaggerated in the two player game. Since it's so easy to get knowledge, we both generally had a good number of pulls from the treasure bag, so it really seemed to be luck that determined who got the best treasure. Still, a nice game that we enjoyed.

RATING: 6
Although it seems highly unlikely that my rating for Thebes will go anywhere but down, I quite enjoyed my first play. "Family" games usually aren't my thing because they tend to pack 30 minutes of game into a luxurious hour, and, really, so does Thebes. Luck may account for more than 50% of a player's result, and setup's rather intricate for such a light game, too.

But, darn it, there's some cool, fun stuff in there too. While the time mechanism has been used before (and since), this was my first exposure, and it works quite nicely. The different paths to points, while layered on a little artificially, lend texture and some dimension as well. FInally, the dig mechanism, while swamped in big turns of luck, lends the game a decent sense of arc. It's the dawn of a new age of archaeology, and intrepid researchers can immortalize themselves if they make the right find. Eventually, though, sites get depleted, and great finds are rarer. It feels right, and somehow the whole package of the game doesn't feel like other games in the niche.

As usual, Queen's production values are top notch, too, aside from the ubiquitous micro-cards.

I'll be playing again in a couple of days, probably, and how well the game holds up will determine if I put this on my want list, as a digestible nod to the fans of lighter fare in my group, or if I quietly let it fade form memory. Part of me wants it to be the former.

UPDATE: Played again, and while it didn't fall apart or anything, a 7 is a bit high for this. The luck really is pretty rampant for an hour-long game. Down to a 6, which still isn't bad from me for a game in this market segment.

I picked this up for the lady - turns out I like it too.

The luck in the game fits the theme, but I won't play this on a night when I don't want to deal with 'luck'. It usually balances out somewhat over the course of the game even so, though; and not just with the tile pulls. For example, one player may get lucky with extra shovels, another with assistants, and another always getting good tile pulls from the bag.

This game screams 'expansion', loudly. I like it fine as is, though.

Good game. The luck can be a downside for certain. But the theme is really well integrated and the player order mecanism is very neat. The fact that the game plays in "2 unofficial phases" is cool (one preparation phases and one digging phase). I like the variety in points: congress, artifacts, exposition (which are a bit to pricy for their worth IMHO), knowledge majority. Components are superb: cloth bag, chronokel (so much better than a plain look up table).

All in a all a really good gateway/family game.

I love the "digging" mechanisms found in the combination of tile draw and "wheel". It's a unique combo that offers many layers of strategy, and serves up alot of tension.

You are an archeologist that spends time gathering knowledge and other tools to conduct a dig.  You travel to various locations in the Middle East and collect treasures.  But the interesting mechanic is that you reach into a bag that has both treasure of various values and sand which is worthless.  The game is very family friendly and highly thematic.  It is a lot of fun, but must admit is a bit random as to what you find (although you can mitigate this).

Not entirely sure what to think of this one. I really like the time based turn order track, the excavation mechanic is good too. What I don't like is it's possible get shut out of some of the cards. It suffers from the same symptom that Alhambra does too in that what you want is probably going to be gone by the time it gets around to you again so it doesn't really do any good to make long term plans.

Great family style game about archaeology and digging for artifacts.  The game is made up of set collecting and then deciding when to go on digs.  The time mechanic is an interesting one too.  The problems I have with it are that sometimes the game can drag and this is due to AP by players sometimes.  That and the "digging" can feel a little bit too lucky sometimes.  You can have tons of research and time and still come up with barely anything to show for it.  Still a good game though.  Looking forward to playing it again.

Queen Games!
Plays with 2!
Heavy luck based despite superior strategy.
Good gateway/light family game; but not longevity.
4 players make for more fun, whereas 2 CAN be a little less exciting.
Sounds like it looses fun after 5-6 plays due to the unrewarding luck element trumping good strategy. NOTE: Game is worth a "2" considering that luck can be modified by varying the sand tiles with any particular strategy. Therefore, the game remains possible to win regardless of experience. ALSO note that luck is consistent with the archaeological theme.

Colorful set-collection game with very nice components and the unusual them of archeology. You get sets of cards and tiles to obtain the most victory points to win. I know people bemoan the amount of luck drawing from the dig bags, but I think it adds to the fun and excitement of the game.

For the first few plays, Thebes feels like it is far too luck driven, but eventually, you come to realise that you need to keep that luck in check by concentrating conferences, exhibitions, and knowledge, and not relying on digging as a sole source of points. A solid light-to-medium weight game with an appealing theme.

A game that truly integrates the theme with the gameplay -- you are actually digging for treasures, and if you are late to a digging site will find more sand...  Fun game, with an engaging theme.  High score for the original mechanics and how well it captures the theme.

Like Twilight Struggle and 1960:TMOTP this is a visually pleasing game, with in game tactile appeal.  Sure, luck plays a significant part.  But there are other things to manage and watch, and ways to maximizes your chances for VP's.

Rating based on one play. The time spent/turn order mechanism is innovative and very good. I liked the game, although it was longer than I liked (2 hrs). For the moment, I'll put that to inexperience though. If we get the game done in about an hour, it'll return to the table more often I guess, if it stays at 2 hours i't'll soon be forgotten.

I was able to give this one to my wife as a present (she likes ancient history, its fun knowing the actual history behind the artifacts pictured).  We both like it, although I did think the rule book could have been better written.

It also plays a bit long and slow with 4 players  

Another disadvantage is my wife always wins :(

RATING: N/A
Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.
The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in "time." So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the "time" to catch up.
In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt. When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.

Always wanted to be an archeologist? Then this is your chance. Beautiful model of what you have to do to be successful in this profession. But to win, you also need a lot of luck. But that doesn't bother at all because it feels thematically consistent. 
This game introduced a very original way to indicate who's next to play (actually by introducing the notion of time in a smart way).
Excellent family game. When you buy this game, you can finally put your monopoly in the trash, because nobody will want to play that anymore.

Played with four and liked it enough to make it one of my dozen buys this year. Very strong theme, and the right dose of luck for a game of this length and weight. With two players, it appears to lack a bit of tension since there is not as strong a need to specialise on a strategy, but that might just be my lack of experience speaking.

2.2 The rules for this game are a bit pants, and I had to get a little extra help on line. But with that in hand, this is a really nice game. The game pieces are nice, the theme works well, I like the last goes first move order. The dig-o-meter works well.

Can evoke cries of 'more sand...?!?!?' in the luck game adverse players. 

Some of the german was not that well translated in the rules and on the cards.

My wife and I have played only one game so far.  On the plus side, the time-investment process works very well - this is the first I have seen of this.  Also this game is very much on-theme.  On the minus side, there seems to be too much chance effects.  Sure you can always act so as to maximize your probabilities, but when the chance effects of cards combine with the chance effects of drawing worthless sand or very variable artifacts from the bags, it has the effect of feeling too much like flipping a coin.  It's hard to get really excited.  Also given the amount of points from various sources, it would be good if you were tracking the scores (except for majority in local knowledge) as you went so you would be more involved trying to catch up or stay ahead.  It would be nice if the artifacts found could be utilized in a more challenging way than the exhibitions.  For strategy we tried to get to the sites fairly early so as to get that first bonus artifact and the fact that the later you go to a site, the more sand there is proportionally.  Later as we built up general and specific knowledge, we could use the extra tries since there were fewer artifacts.

Great fun.  Very nice components, and marvelous theme integration.  Kudos to Queen for the graphics on the cards, which make the game easy to play and teach.

Some have bemoaned the luck inherent in the tile draws for archeological digs.  I've had my share of good and bad luck in this game, and personally find the capriciousness of the tile draws thematically appropriate.  It's entirely possible to prepare wonderfully for a dig, spend plenty of time, and still find mostly damnable dust.  I should know, I AM an archeologist!

OK, not really, but I have played this game several times, and as always the luck works itself out multiple plays.  And there are enough other ways to score points to stay in the game and even win despite your rotten digging luck.  And it plays quickly, so you won't have to spend too long contemplating why the tile bags hate you.

One of my kids' favorites.

If you decide to get this game…GET IT BECAUSE YOU WANT A FUN, FAMILY GAME. Don't get it if you are going to take it too seriously. You can definitely draw very poorly in this game, causing you to be completely out of contention. The scoring is not hidden, and is quite obvious, so if someone is winning by a landslide, both players are aware of it. That said, this game is great. The gameplay is smooth and quick, the components are sturdy, the art is thematic, and the "excavating" is super fun! Despite the randomness of the bag draw, this game has a permanent place in my collection.

RATING: 5
3 / 5 - Good.

Well done theme off simply rules and nicely blended luck and strategy - I particularly like the balance between wanting to dig as early as possible and needing to collect knowledge and resources in order to dig. However, there is an awful lot of luck involved - as much as whether you turn over new cards in your current location as drawing from the dig bag. Wouldn't be a problem in itself, but it seems to generate very little tension or excitement. It's an unfortunate fact that all the excitement happens at the start of the game when you're racing to collect cards and there's still lots of treasures in the dig bags - late in the game there's nothing left to do and the bags are near-empty so the endgame falls flat. Works fantastically well as a family/gateway game - it's simple, enough luck for non-gamers and kids do find drawing tokens very exciting.

RATING: 7
A game that seems to be very luck-heavy - because of both which cards are available and which tokens are drawn.  A string of bad luck (or outrageous good luck for a competitor) can easily leave a bad taste in player's mouths, and makes the game less appealing - a big problem when you have dozens of games to choose from!  There are probably luck mitigation strategies that would help, but they're not immediately obvious from the rules.
Great components, but too much luck, not enough strategy.

I love the theme in this game.  Players are archeologists trying to gain knowledge of various dig sites.  They then travel to the sites and try to uncover artifacts.

Played three-player games on 08/25/07 & 11/03/07. As the majority of others have commented, the luck factor in this game is HUGE (I'd estimate 80%). If it was a 20-30 minute game I guess I could tolerate that. But to play an 85 to 115 minute game where about 75% of your score comes from the total crapshoot of the bag draws for artifacts (plus the luck of the card draw from the knowledge card display) is too much for me to stomach. Pity, as many of the mechanics fit the theme quite well, something seldom seen in German games.

Have played with 2, 3, and 4 players.  I really like it.  It felt a little long the first time, but not after that.  I think it was just because it was the first play.  I love the theme, the bits, the way it all works together - the whole experience of it.  It's also likely a little slower with me since I'm colorblind - even though there are symbols on things to match them up as well, it takes a little longer to distinguish them.

The original time spend = steps taken mechanic, found back later in Tinner's Trails and Red November. Fun game. One might object against the luck factor of the draw of the tiles, but I felt it appropriate with the theme. Don't play it if you can't stand the luck factor.

And the biggest advantage: this is THE game for a gamenight if you want to bring your guests some drinks & snacks in between: just go dig for a couple of weeks!

Ordered it after 1 play. So I guess I like it...

A bad experience with luck in my first game may have soured this one for me a bit.  I've played again and I found it more enjoyable, but it still bothers me the extent to which luck can cause huge swings in scores.

A good, solid game with excellent production. I had a lot of fun with this one but thought there was quite a bit of luck involved. Very lucky draws on my part won the game and I feel that I did the least to put myself in a position to do so. Still a fun game, though.Update: better with 3 than 4. Luck is extremely influential in this game and I'm not sure it's completely worth it. I do like it OK, but given the millions of better games out there, this will be down on the list. Good components and good bits, but it reminds me of Thurn and Taxis which I dislike.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Play as archeologists racing against time and each other time to do research and conduct digs across the map in order to gain the most notoriety (victory points). 

Played as: 3,4 player

Pros: Excellent presentation of board and bits. I realize when you read a brief description of this game, there’s a sense of "yeah right, it’s probably another cardboard pusher in some drab pasted-on middle-east setting," but this really does give you a strong sense of that theme. The "time, as a currency, for what you do on your turn" element really translates well as players juggle the benefits of doing more research in order to allow them to work more efficiently in digs vs just getting out there and try to grab stuff before things get picked over. Underneath, is still a strong euro game that gives players several different avenues for scoring points whether by being more knowledgeable, spending more time lobbying congress, or putting on exhibitions with what you’ve managed to dig up. 

Cons: Some people may not like the randomness of blindly pulling tiles out of a bag representing the actual dig. It can be frustrating at times to spend a significant chunk of time digging and come up with only a couple trinkets. I’ve found this usually balances out enough to not detract, but control freaks should steer clear. I felt like there was possibly a few too many stupid little nuance rules to keep track of, with no good aid to remind you (ex: which cards do you keep vs. discard after using), for being a game on the slightly lighter side. Also, I think the game would see a lot more table time if it played about 30 minutes shorter.

Other:  In the same way RA encouraged me to try more auction games, this game makes me want to try other archeology games. With RA, my expanding in the genre just made me realize I started with the best, and I’m guessing the same might be true for Thebes and archeology games.  I think they just nailed it.

Best Use: A lighter, more ‘fun’ Euro that still has some bones. I’d probably introduce it to gamers just past the gateways.

Es un juego de unos 45 minutos-1 hora y cuyos componentes son una auténtica preciosidad. El juego es bonito de narices y la temática me encantaba, aunque este tipo de cosas, en los juegos suele ser más un “corta y pega”.
Y es que en Más allá de Tebas, cada jugador es un erudito arqueólogo que se pasa los días recorriendo las bibliotecas más importantes de Europa en búsqueda de información y pistas sobre los más importantes yacimientos arqueológicos de Egipto, Grecia... Tebas. Cuando cree haber recopilado suficientes pistas puede viajar a estos lugares e invertir las semanas que crea necesario en excavar. Puede que tenga suerte y encuentre los tesoros más valiosos, otros no tanto, pistas sobre otros posibles yacimientos o simplemente nada. El factor suerte está muy presente en este juego, pero cuantas más pistas y semanas dediques a estudiar un yacimiento, más posibilidades hay que de que encuentres algo.
Si bueno, esa es la ambientación pero, ¿realmente el juego da la sensación de que estés haciendo algo así? Las ambientaciones de muchos juegos son temas pegados de mala manera. Mira sino el Exploradores. La temática es casi idéntica pero cuando empiezas a jugar dices... ¡Si me dices que lo que estoy haciendo es cocer un buen plato de fabada, paso a paso, también me lo creo: después del 3, el 4, y luego el 5, que el 2 no lo puedo jugar porque he tapado el hueco!
Pues en Tebas si que da la sensación que realmente estás recabando pistas e investigando sobre tu próxima investigación: hay 4 cartas bocarriba que te dicen que hay 2 pistas en Viena para excavar en Egipto, 1 en Berlín para ir a Tebas, una conferencia (puntos extra) en Moscú y una pista general en Londres. Tú decides a qué ciudad viajar. Por cada ciudad que pases es una semana de tiempo, más el tiempo (siempre en semanas) que gastes en realizar la carta elegida. Mueves tu contador tantos puntos como semanas invertidas y entonces sigue el jugador que está último en el contador. Este sistema es muy ameno, bastante real y permite que si haces cosas muy pequeñas, puedas hacer varios turnos seguidos. En cambio, si decides invertir mucho tiempo en una cosa, hasta que no vuelvas a ser último en la línea de tiempo te comes los mocos.
En un momento dado, cuando crees que has recabado suficientes pistas para viajar a un yacimiento, en tu turno gastas las semanas pertinentes en llegar al lugar y en tu brújula, consultas cuantas fichas puedes sacar del saco de esa excavación según las pistas que tengas y las semanas extras que inviertas. Cuando ya lo has decidido, a lo mejor te toca sacar 7 fichas del saquito de Egipto. Algunas fichas serán tesoros, o alguna pista para otras excavaciones, y otras, simplemente arena del desierto.
Cuando han pasado 3 años (2 años con 4 jugadores), el juego termina y se recuentan los puntos de victoria (tesoros, exposiciones, mayoría de pistas en una excavación...).
El juego: me encantó. Bonito, rápido, emocionante, con algo de puteo y azar y sencillo.

I really like this game after one play.

As I've heard many times, it is very thematic, and I do not mind the luck inherent in the game. I believe that fits the theme.

I like the way one can score points different ways. Even if a player doesn't obtain many artifacts there are still the congress cards and the majority of special knowledge for each excavation site.

I love the game despite the obvious luck factor which is so well integrated with the theme. There are many interesting decisions to be made and I think that playing optimally (or at least better than your opponents) can significantly improve your scores in the long run. 
The only criticism would be that there are lots of little, fiddly rules which don't really add much to the game. I think the rules could have been made a little bit more elegant.

Quite a bit to like about how this game works for something that's relatively simple.  The mechanics fit well with the theme.  The diminishing returns of searching for artifacts amongst the sand works well.  The fact that actions take varying amounts of time, and how it plays into turn order is not unique, but it is neat.  And the wheel is fun to play with as well.

Wow. On the surface, this game has it all -- a really cool "time" mechanic where each action takes a different amount of time and time is the (main) resource that you have to manage. Though decisions. Angst. Great theme. But man, those random digs, are RANDOM! And quite annoying. I dig for 8 tokens and get 5 VPs out of it -- 2x one point and 1x three points. My opponent digs for 5 tokens and come out with 15 points??! (6, 5, 3, 1, blank -- or something like that). The game definitely rewards luck more than anything else. If they had done pretty much anything else for digging up sites, the game could've easily been an 8.

Queen has done an excellent job reimplementing this gem from Prinz.  Thebes is steeped in theme and is a great lesson in opimization and probability.  Most importantly it's exciting ... afterall you're digging up treasure.
 
I'm suprised at the few reviewers who say that the "old" version was less luck-dependent.  Why?  Prove it!  I disagree with those people but I still think they're really cool for loving the old version.  Give me a call and we'll play Funkenschlag.

I love the determination of turn order in Thebes (each action you take has a certain amount of time associated with its completion, and players take their turns once the actual time advances to the point where they are free). This game is always fun, but is kept from greatness by the inherent randomness in the tile drawing; in my games, scoring from the artifacts has vastly overwhelmed other scoring methods. Investing a large amount of time near the beginning of the game to draw 7 tiles of dirt is painful - and irrecoverable.

Enjoyable Euro, where the theme is successful - which makes a nice change.

Good family-friendly game of archeology. The luck of the draw can be a tad nasty, though, so if you're easily frustrated, watch out. The game looks gorgeous, though, and though the rule book is a bit hazy on some points, this is a fairly easy and intuitive game. The time mechanism is excellent.

I've played the game with two and four, and I think I somewhat prefer the two-player game: there's more time to do research and you can plan on longer term. With four players, you get more competition. The table talk can be delicious, if your fellow players can take some ribbing and won't explode if you deride their bad luck on excavations...

All in all, it's a fun, well-themed game with some fine mechanics and a heavy dose of luck (which can be tuned a bit).

Suggest.

A clever little game, with a rare interaction between theme and mechanics that one does not often find in a Euro. I especially enjoyed the time mechanics, and the degree to which the game really did seem like a race between archaeologists and explorers to do research and then get to the dig sites before their peers. I will definitely say yes to future games of this. However, it's worth nothing that in spite of its clever mechanics, it's still little more than a filler.

After 1 play.  Really enjoyed the timing mechanic, and the digging which is kind of press your luck.  My only real complaint is that the game felt too long for its own sake, and sometimes you feel like you're waiting a long time between turns, especially if people take a number of turns before you go again.  Waiting on slow diggers can be tedious, also.  Still, very likeable, and quite different.

RATING: 7
Very thematic time management, set collection, tableau building Euro where you play as archaeologists drafting cards to gain knowledge in different colors to allow you to get the most out of a "dig" when the time is right. The "digging" aspect is controversial among my gaming group since there are so many blanks in the bag when you're finally ready to dig, that it can feel like a luckfest and a waste of time. I think the game doesn't need to be taken that seriously and even if you get a bad draw in one dig, you might get a better draw from another dig. The trick is to play the probabilities and not dig until you're ready to dig as much as possible for the best chance at getting something good. I also love the Tokaido style turn order where last place on the time track goes next so taking smaller actions nets you more turns. The flipside is that when you do a dig, you will likely spend a lot of time points and end up waiting a while for your turn. Again, the trick is to take that action after others have done it so that you don't get too far ahead of the other players and end up waiting for your turn forever.

I was taught this game by none other than Mr. Rio Grande Games, Jay Tummelson, at Utah's annual game convention in 2007 prior to its new English version release. Jay has a nice sense of humor. After mentioning that the game takes three years to play, he playfully wondered if we would be able to continue after the 10:00pm closing time. During his rules explanation, Jay really sold the excavation theme.  This is truly one Euro game that has a rich, realistic theme. Some do not like the luck associated with searching for buried treasures, but it does seem true to the theme. This is a good gateway game on par with games such as Cleopatra and the Society of the Architects.

If one can cope with layers of luck (tile draws and card draws) determining the majority of scoring, give this one a try. Interesting time track that is the most important resource for players to spend, yet balanced with race like aspects like dwindling supplies of relics in the draw bags. Good fun but be aware of the potential for frustration of a bad draw or poorly timed card draw punishing you or rewarding someone else.

The theme works very well and time flies in a two-player game. The scientist in me loves how research increases the likelihood of success during digs and the acquisition of victory points through scientific meetings and exhibits is a very nice touch.

However, digging could have been slightly better balanced to increase the chances of actually finding an artifact in the bag. It can get very frustrating to pick dirt over and over again...

Repetitive, but fun, tense and thematic. Luck is definitely a factor, but it makes it even more fun, tense and thematic. The only drawback is that the game always seem to last too long and the latest turns are just a race to get the end of all digs.

This game is dripping with theme and adds a bit more luck than traditional strategy games. These two factors make the game extremely fun. Digging for valuable artifacts is a blast. The rules are simple to understand and teach. Someone completely new to the game can hang with veterans. There are several strategic moves a player can make. There's nothing worse than drawing rubble from the bag. Yet, there's nothing more satisfying than digging up a high value artifact. Very fun.

I was really surprised by Thebes. Queen Games tend to make products where a central mechanism is used to facilitate a gaming experience, but this is one of the few cases where it was done so successfully. I was pretty weary about trying Thebes, mainly because it seemed like a game of pulling chits out of a bag, but it's so much more than that. You have to spend time preparing for your expeditions by getting knowledge, tools, and help from various cities, and then when you go, you effectively push your luck to try and find the most valuable artifacts. The drawing from a bag can feel random, but you do know the odds ahead of time. I also really like the fact that you can spend as much or as little time as you want digging based on how prepared you are.

This is just a really cool game that is surprisingly thematic for what it is. I've seen people get screwed by the bag draw, but you have to know that this element is present when you play the game. I think that as long as you play intelligently, you'll come away from this game feeling like you were competitive. One of the best games Queen has ever put out, to be sure.

What I like best with Thebes is the time mechanism. You simply decide how much time to spend on your actions - the more time you spend, the better the outcome, but this also puts you "ahead in time", giving the turn to the other players and giving you less time to do other things. The time is spent traveling, acquiring knowledge and searching for artifacts. The more knowledgeable you are and the more time spent searching, the more tiles you get to draw from the artifact bag. The drawing may add too much randomness to Thebes but it's still a fun and light game.

Fun, easy game.  I know some people hate the randomness of the tile pulling from the bag, but it's definitely where most of the fun in the game comes from.  Watching someone pull nothing but junk out of the bag is hilarious, and it's equally awesome when someone hits the jackpot.

Wow!! This is like the best theme for a game that I have seen, since Power Grid!!  I love this game...the new version by Queen is fabulous and the game is so much fun to play.  Just a great mix of luck and skill (planning) and healthy competition between the players....put your hand in one of five ancient sacks and "dig" for valuable relics......after completing research in one of seven continental European cities and then return for exhibitions!!  Cool.....this is a wonderful game.  Thank you!!  Will enjoy this one for years to come with family and friends.  
Note:  There are some cool ways to reduce the luck element some in the digs that actually help the game, in my opinion, for more serious gamers.

In 1900, each player plays an archealogical explorer (cue the Indiana Jones music). With an allotment of 52 weeks, each player spends time travelling from city to city to gain knowledge in cities where treasures are located. Treasure is represented by drawing tokens out of a bag. Typically a treasure bag would contain VP chits from 1 to 7 VPs, and half the tokens would be worthless. A player invests time and knowledge to gain a number of pulls out of the treasure bag. After a dig, the worthless tokens are thrown back into the treasure bag. 

There is a lot of luck in pulling tokens out of the bag. The game has nice components, and a lot of people don't seem to mind the luck factor. There are different strategies to try, such as collecting congress cards, or concentrating digs in only one city, but the luck appears to override anything else. Only played once with 4 players, and everyone else did not really enjoy the experience.

Therefore, this may not be the game for you if you consider [i]winning[/i] all-important, but for everyone else, it's a great game!

This is the game other publishers should look to when trying to figure out how to incorporate theme.  The theme is perfectly interwoven into the game.  There's a bit (quite a bit) of luck, but I always have a great time playing this.  I've got 12 knowledge and I'll spend 8 weeks and I get..... nothing????  That guy has 4 knowledge spends 4 weeks, and gets the top 3 treasures???  It should be frustrating, but somehow it's not.  I love it!

Easy to teach, family friendly.  Very satisfying strategy/luck ratio and tactile experience makes it fun, and the theme/setting leads to some geography/history conversations with the kids - as well as the importance of goal setting ("You want to excavate in Crete?  Well, you better take that class in London and maybe grab that assistant in Rome to help you!").  

For adults, the gameplay has a few different paths to success, some "take that", and push your luck elements.  And while luck is a factor, you can mitigate it - and you always know your odds.  Works well as 2 player game, though 3 and 4 player also fun.  Turns are quick.  All in all a great game at an accessible price (and very good quality components and nice artwork).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tremendously fun, but luck driven as all get out.  You have some control over how significantly luck will impact your game, but I wouldn't call the outcome more than 50% under your own control.  The theme manifests beautifully with the separate tile bags and the manipulation of your position on the time track is really quite a nice design idea.  I'm ultimately torn on how to rate this.  The nuts and bolts of the game don't feel like much more than a 6, but the fun it translates to is worth an 8.  For now, I'll split the difference.

--update--
7 feels right.  But it's a very positive 7.  Particularly when played with a more casual group that won't blink an eye at, and indeed will really enjoy, the amount of luck in the game.

Interesting game that has lots of luck embedded into it, although it is one of those luck-driven games where as long as you intelligently play the odds, you are ahead of the game.

You play an Indiana Jones type archaeologist that is traveling across Europe to uncover secret artifacts that will eventually score you points and win the game.  You can only dig at one of the five types of sites once per game, so you do not want to jump in one too early without enough 'intelligence points', however, if you wait long enough someone else might dig there first and steal all the good treasure.

A decent push-your-luck set collecting game.  I fine this to be a bit of a mix of Ticket to Ride and hmmm...a game that has a luck based system to it...

 I like the elements of the game: time consumption a la neuland, digging in different bags (full of artefacts -earning VPs - and sand) for artefacts and putting the sand back, and once the digging is basically exhausted VPs can be earned by getting exhibition cards. Travelling for digging, helper cards and exhibition cards takes place on a map. The elements together however do not make a great game. It is a bit repetitive, luck is rampant, and it lasts just too long.

After one play, this game seems to be somewhat luck heavy. There are the guaranteed points from the lectures, but other than that, everything else is a gamble. Going on digs takes alot of time, and can come up with nothing. It seems like it's almost better to just collect lectures whenever possible, and go hunting for short periods to try and grab a treasure or two.

RATING: 7.5
Medium to light game with an important luck factor (not only in the draws from the excavations, but also on the cards played over the board). But the luck is not as decisive as they say, because things tend to balance on the long term.

The components are very nice, the theme is very strong, it is relatively fast and most important, the game is very fun to play.

RATING: 8
Thebes looks and feels a very good family game. Mechanics are simple and easy to understand and are well tied into theme.

There is quite high luck factor on both drawing of the new cards and digging artifacts. Especially on dig sites someone can luckily draw couple high scoring artifacts on his few tiles when someone else spends more time to find nothing but sand. The high luck factor didn't bother me but it is worth mentioning since it seems to bother others. But what could be more fun than to laugh at someones misfortune?

The game is best when played with (2 or) 3 players as then there is more time per player and luck of draw should even out a little bit more. Overall I liked Thebes a lot and consider it a very good game. Theme works here and game is fun to play.

An extremely thematic optimization game.

The turn order system is absolutely brilliant. The excavation mechanism is quite interesting as well but the results depend a great deal on luck of the draw. This can be tuned with variants, though, if it bothers you.

Gorgeous and sturdy components. Especially the wheels feel great. The box insert is quite useless since there's no place for the board.

Mikko traded it for a cup of coffe. Thanks for the game! ;)
I find this to be a very thematic game. The result of the game is heavily influenced by the luck in the archeology tile draws: you can be lucky and get highly valued items while some other players all they get is just sand. For some gamers this will be an automatic "no-go", but for me it fits well with the game theme.

Neat game, i'd play it again to try out a different strategy... but its way too random for me, and i think it would be easy to play the game "cheaply"

It could be really fun as long as you dont play too hard to win, It's designed to be a light game, so to enjoy it you need to play it that way.

One aspect of the game i LOVED was the movment phase!!! It's really hard to describe, but you move though time, and you have control of the board as long as you havn't passed (in time) anyone else. That probablly didn't do it justice, but it was the best part of the game. I'd like to see it implemented in a different game for sure.


I could play it again, but i'd rather not

Played this once years ago with some friends - it was one of the first real eurogames I ever played. Picked up a copy after Xmas 2010.

I love the time track mechanic, and have looked at other games with a similar system (like Olympos), but none have the pressured feeling this game seems to bring when you're trying to plan your moves within the constraints of the game. 

Very competitive with four players. It doesn't seem to be quite so interesting with two.

It can also be incredibly frustrating if you are consistently unlucky drawing from the bags, especially if you've devoted a lot of time in one action to a single bag.

Early impressions seem to be favourable here. There is an argument that it is heavy on the luck factor, but as someone who doesn't mind some luck in games, I like this. The luck can be mitigated by spending time gaining knowledge, or completing the exhibitions. All in all, a very enjoyable game.

We had a first go at this tonight (as a warm-up game). 4 players, my friend thought it was too luck dependent, I must agree.

Played with 6 year old. This is a point salad but not in a good way. The main way of getting points is through digging for artifacts but the randomness of the draw really makes planning very difficult. There is hardly any strategy here and most of the time, gameplay is based on tactical decisions of where to go based on which cards are on offer. Most of the time, you'll be maximising the weeks spent by heading to a location with at least 2 cards to take. 

The decision on how many weeks to spend digging for treasure is also not satisfying as you don't want to spend too many weeks lest your opponent gets too many turns but you also need to balance the probability of digging up treasures based on what's left. Most of the time we end up choosing taking 6 weeks as it's the median of what's available to choose from. 

In the end, I won by a huge margin but I had no idea how who was ahead during the game as we didn't keep track of our artifact scores and there was no game provided means to do so short of using pen and paper. I think this is what brings the game down for me.

Good first play impressions. Really fun to dig for treasures. This is a fine example of how luck should be used in a game. *Update* Find it slightly repetitive somehow with same starting moves. Dropped down a notch for me.

Awesome! This is a true archeology dig for treasure. The funny thing about this game is that it is so much fun to play and so memorable that you think about it well after you finish the game...and yet it doesn't see a lot of game plays. But that's just it...when you crave that great game experience again you will bring Thebes out to play again! Travel from city to city gaining knowledge, then make your way to the dig sites to uncover lost treasure. Bring your treasures back to town to exhibit them and receive more victory points for your efforts! What fun!

Delivering efficient and fun Euros, Queen games are usually "lean," using innovative and simple mechanics. And Thebes is no exception. Players are archaeologists spending most of the game preparing for their "digs" at ancient sites to find artifacts to bring back and sell back in Europe for the most fame. Here, time, not money or food is the main commodity of the game: every action requires time and the player who best utilizes theirs to find the most valuable artifacts wins. I love the "digging"/push-your-luck mechanic of the game because it is reliant on randomness. And players can spend more time at dig sites to draw more from the bag or gather cards that will improve chances. Every "dig site" is a bag of tokens with roughly a 50% chance of drawing something of value; the other half are blank tokens, or "debris." And no matter the outcome of your dig, debris tokens are added back to the bag to lower the chances of drawing something of value. As bags get depleted of their value, players scramble to other "dig sites" for better artifacts. The tension of drawing from the bag made the game much more enjoyable than a straight strategy game for me. Paulo beat me in the end, only because if you have the most points at one site you get endgame bonuses. Overall, a fantastic game where players balance luck and strategy for the most points. While that sounds like every Euro, Thebes will always get played when I'm around because it's fast and easy to understand.

This game is all about the pulls - the pulling of tiles from the bag, keeping the good chips, leaving the bad chips. It dominates the game. The frustration of getting bad pulls outweighs any good fortune felt for getting good pulls. You feel bad for others when they're unlucky having poured all their time in to maximise their chances. You feel guilt for pulling 3 great tiles for a minimal time investment. If you like a lottery, knock yourself out because the rest of the game is interesting and has great bits.

Archaeological digging game where u can research along to way to help you dig better, can be a bit of a pain grabbing tokens out of the bag and it being hit or miss (it's totally random so could get lucky or not). Be prepared for the "dig dig dig" chant on people's turns, it's a decent game with a very interesting turn order which I really like (the person whom is behind on the time track goes 1st).

"Very thematic game with great mechanisms. Great as a 'next-step' game after gateways, but interesting for more serious gamers who are OK with some randomness."

What I like:
- LOVE the time-track mechanism
- Beautiful components
- Every aspect of the game fits the theme well
- Plenty of strategic and tactical decisions

What I don't like:
- Sometimes the chit draws can be swingy
- Can run long (if people don't move briskly)

It's on the complicated side for non-gamers (the 2.2 weight is probably a bit low--I would say 2.4), but some serious gamers are going to hate the chit-drawing (and card-drawing) randomness (and might overlook the strategies for mitigating the luck).

I have played 2p games in as little as 45 minutes, but a 4p learning game took 150. Probably 90-120 minutes is a reasonable target for most player counts, with more players toward the upper end. It is best played with "instinctive" players rather than "analytical" players, to keep the pace up.

A fun game about being an archaeologist digging up treasures from the ancient world.  The use of time as both the "clock" for the game itself and a way to set turn order is interesting.  And the digging aspects and execution are very neat.

Many will complain about the sheer randomness of getting treasures out of digs, particularly after a given location has been the subject of a number of digs.  But this seems to fit the theme quite well - as you dig up stuff, there's less stuff to find.

Lots of interesting choices to make here, good strategy, and a number of different paths to victory make this a good game.

Che bella ambientazione, la corsa all'archeologia del secolo scorso! 

Thebes, nella sua semplicità, ti convince a partire dall'ordine di turno, basato sulle settimane contate, da dividere tra studi, congressi, scavi e presentazioni.

L'ordine di gioco variabile permette un po' di libertà strategica, e il tempo che passa rende benissimo nell'Europa di inizio secolo: devi andare da Berlino a Parigi? Metti in conto due settimane.

La parte degli scavi è ben implementata: sia nella distribuzione dei punti (ogni scavo ne ha una differente) sia nella la ruota (che determina il numero di pescate dal sacchetto degli scavi) velocizza i calcoli su conoscenza del luogo e bonus accumulati. La pesca delle tessere negli scavi è pesantemente governata dalla fortuna, ma quando non tocca a te, è divertente godere del fallimento dei tuoi avversari :) 

Una bella sorpresa scoperta tardi.

They seem to have got the theme of travelling, acquiring knowledge, time spent and particularly the random luck of the dig represented really well in this game.

Sure is a nice [i]looking[/i] game.  And I love the time-track mechanic, that is the coolest new mechanic I've seen in a while.  Plus, this game is wonderfully and consistently themed to a ca 1900 archeology narrative.

But overall, way too heavy in luck for my taste, based on one play. Not only is the excavating a long odds proposition, but the luck is compounded with the now-you-see-them-now-you-don't nature of the exhibition cards. In our four player game not one person got an exhibit up.  The excavating seemed almost silly, in its risk/reward ratio. And, that being the only way to score, you have to take that chance..

This game has a lot of clever mechanics (like the turn order mechanism) and very nice components.  On the other hand, the intersection of the luck from the card drafting and the luck from the excavations makes luck a huge factor in this game.  And the dirt-to-stuff ratio is pretty low, making seemingly exciting digs often a disappointment.

Good, luck-based, family game. Games play a little different depending on the number of players.

In a two player game you're able to excavate at least three times on the same site because you play three years. Plus there's a lot left in the bags to dig for because there's only two players.

In a four player game this is different. You play only two years so there's less chance and time to go digging. Fun. The congress cards are a valid strategy in a 4 player game too.

Great components and a fair amount of fun. Great theme. My oldest daughter (9 when I write this) likes it quite a bit; as with Tikal, she likes to dig treasures. So I'll say it's a good kids game also. 

I will use a cliche on the geek and say it is "too long for what it is". It's closer to good than being just an ok waste of time. I have not played this game very much, but I suspect the replay value is rather low.

Thebes is not necessarily the most deep or strategic game you will ever play, but it does have an incredibly elegant merging of mechanisms and theme. I love how different actions, movements, or choices expend certain amounts of time which propels you toward the end of the game (the year 1903). And I also love how when you excavate treasures, the odds of finding more treasure on return trips decrease.

We've played this one a few times now and it's a fun game, it basically comes down to collecting coloured card sets, the more you have the more you can 'dig' and the greater chance you have of getting something good.

As a wannabe archaeologist, I really enjoyed the theme of this game, which has you exploring ancient ruins in the hopes of finding artifacts. Game play is very simple, so this would be a very fine family game.

$13 - $25 Amazon GC from Eric Dong

It offered a very thematic experience for me that everything that we were doing made sense in this game. But I feel this is the only strong suit of this game. The rest of the experience made me initially rate this game at 7/10. The pulls lacks tension since my girlfriend was nice about it although I did yell "dirt! dirt! dirt!" when she was pulling them out. Luck seems to even out for us since it is a 2 player game with plenty of chances to dig and I can imagine the frustration might escalate when there are more players since you cannot have a lot of opportunity to dig for artifacts.

---- Update ----
I suspect this game is all about digging. The Congress card is important but the exhibits are not worth the time to invest in them. Due to this, 2-player games are one-dimensional and not worth playing. Rating 7 --> 6

---- Update ----
Due to 2-player game is broken, it got traded in a math trade.

Oldest daughter really likes this one and I don't mind it . Thematically the drawing of artifacts from the bag makes sense BUT it can screw a player over big time and whilst there is the ability to mitigate such events to an extent the draw from the bag can determine the outcome a little too often in my view ...

Thebes is unusual in the sense that it has very strong theme: Turn of the century archaeological expeditions by Europeans in the Mid and Near East.  The main facets of this activity are resource development/study, expeditions to dig up artifacts, and exhibitions to show them off for fame.  The comment complaint on expeditions is the influence of luck -- so be it...I personally enjoy the way it is done.

My one complaint with this edition is that the selection of exhibitions are arbitrary, in that certain combinations of artifacts allow for no exhibitions to be held for them.  It seems unnecessarily serendipitous.

More thematically filling than most euros, and easy to explain as everything makes sense.  Has a nice length to it, and there are multiple options for scoring.  Has a couple cute mechanics and rewards patience and doesn't feel completely pressured to do more than you want (like, say, Through the Desert or Railroad Tycoon).  Fits a nice, newbie friendly niche, but isn't totally reliant on strategy, and AP is pretty much out the window (as I said, there are multiple decisions to make, sometimes obvious, sometimes a little more subtle, but all are logically easy to grasp).  Plus, the disks are fun to use.  Has a push-your-luck element in the digs of time vs. # of chips to draw, which I enjoy.

Though some may complain that there's no player interaction, there is a "step on somebody's toes" element, where you take things before others do, and this can sometimes lead to strategy choices based on card distribution and the number of dig chips taken.  Also, you tend to have time to react to other people's (apparent) long-term strategies.

That said, I'm not sure how much I enjoy it.  I'm not sure it really scratches my nerdy competition itch, and the chip draw can be obnoxiously lucky at times.  Still my first game was fun and close, and I look forward to at least the next few plays, while likely to suggest it, so it gets an 8.

Two really, really cool mechanics:  the diminishing returns on the draw bags, and the time-to-return mechanism on the moves.  Great marriage of mechanics and themes:  can't imagine the former without the latter,and can't imagine a more effective way of simulating archeology in this period.

I really enjoy the turn order and digging mechanics not to mention the theme. It's a pretty luck-filled game so I think it works best played as a light-hearted game.

Thebes is the kind of game that can get the whole family excited, and not in a Disney kind of way.. and that's good.  That's good, because it means that Thebes is a game that can be played with good friends who may/may not be 'all that' into gaming.

For me, my game groups tend to fall in both categories and so Thebes does very well and I expect it to do so well in to the future.

Thebes, in many ways, mimics a kind of 'Indiana Jones' simplicity into early 20th century archeology.  In this game, players will move from city to city to gain knowledge of various dig sites.

Once acquired, players take that knowledge to the dig site and determine how much time they want to invest in looking for artifacts.. and that's how the game is measured:  time.  Around the board are numbers 1-52, representing weeks of the year.  As weeks become months and months become years, players will gain more artifacts, present more exhibitions (courtesy of the artifacts), and gain more notoriety.  

In the end, and as per usual, whoever has the most points wins.

There's the synopsis.  The game, though, is quite simple and easy to grasp.  There is some strategy in choosing what your path may be to victory (ie: what site you want to dig in), and there's some fun and excitement to be wrung from drawing tokens at random from one of the 5 provided 'dig bags' in corresponding colour.

Lots of fun, worth an 8, re-playability should be OK, but yet luck plays a massive factor (via cards and random draws) that anyone can beat pretty much anyone else, if luck plays a major factor at all.

I have enjoyed this game each time we played, but there is something about it that keeps me from feeling that undefinable compulsion to play that is the mark of a great game.

I really enjoy the time management mechanism, and the theme is nicely integrated, so it's not that it isn't well designed. Perhaps it's the feeling that, somehow, I can see through the game's mechanics on some level, and play feels like more of a mechanical process than actual discovery. Odd, really, because as I said, I enjoy this, but there isn't the magic there I find in some other games.

The action-point per week mechanism is fun, but it feels like there is just not enough theme on this game.  Set collection and getting the right draws at the right time appear to dominate, even if you try to mitigate luck through smart digging decisions.

Sold because to save time on travelling to draft cards, meant positioning yourself ideally to anticipate what cards could be drafted where; the location detail on the cards was one step to far. Especially since you felt you needed to save travel time to counter the random chit pull, which again was marred by too much detail, especially as each site varied. Seems as though the card version (minus locations) is the design done right, despite the loss of globetrotting.

A fun game, despite the element of luck. The theme works well and the beautiful components/board make this game. The meshing of Euro elements with the luck of 'digging' artifact chits from cloth bags just seems to work somehow (even though, on paper it doesn't seem like it would). Sometimes a lucky player will win over someone who has played more tactically (but that seems to fit the theme, too). It is fun to chant 'dirt, dirt, dirt' as someone else pulls nothing but dirt during one of their excavations (and then angrily throws the bag across the room).

The luck factor in this game is extremely high. The downtime between turns is also extremely high without giving you much if anything to think about. The game is incredibly mathy as you have to budget 52 action points per round. The cards also awkwardly don't have consistent iconography which means cards will behave differently from how you would suspect, which really hurts as they all have really basic effects. I hope to not have to play this game again.

RATING: 5
I'm no hater of randomness and risk management, but the draws from the bags in Thebes seemed a bit much (and I don't care how thematic they are). The rest of the game felt quite calculable (if you could be bothered) in terms of action-point to benefit conversion, and then there's this huge dose of luck. It also means the game tails off towards the end because there's not much left worth digging for.

The luck factor didn't bother me because we were aware of it going in. In fact it is what is part of the fun of the game. Cheering for dirt as the person draws a bunch of tiles and then going in after them to steal the artifacts! It was a lot of fun, although I could see serious gamers get bent out of shape by the luck. As an intro and gateway game this one is tops, plus the theme is one of the best fits to the mechanics I've ever seen. Definately on the to buy list.

RATING: 7.2
The theme in the game is further developed by the mechanics and cards in the game.  The time track mechanic is very cool.  I love the excitement/tension when my kids reach into the bag during a 'dig' and pull out treasures (hooray) or nothing (boooo!).  Not a 'heavy' game but definitely a game whose mechanics support the theme!  I probably should rate this game higher.

Interesting mechanics. Although it is true to theme that the digging gets harder the more folks have dug at a site, this tends to detract from the game as one quickly runs out of places to bother digging and if you're locked out of combos for the museam exibits then you just spend your time wiping the display in hope of finding the card collection multipliers.

RATING: 8
The game is well interwoven with thematic mechanisms.
I like the time based turn mechanic. The actions take a variable amount of time, which drives the turn order and when you can take the next turn. 
Discovering is by digging into the artifact bag to pull tiles. Each of the sites have a slightly different set of tile values.
Collecting sets of knowledge help your chances of finding something, You get to pull more tiles. Very important in the early phases.  

Good family style game with a nice bit of strategy and a healthy dollop of randomness.

A highly thematic, enjoyable light-medium game, with nice bits and very little conflict among players.
When digging for treasures, beyond calculating probabilities, it is luck what runs the game, but on the other hand there are other aspects that can be planned and controlled.
I especially like the turn order system based on the weeks spent by each player and the varied ways of getting VPs.

RATING: 7.5
Thebes is probably one of my game where the theme is the most relevent. Easy machanics, and more than average material quality makes it one of my favorite queen's game. There is a fare share of luck in the game that can leave strategy fan frustrated. But I thinks that the luck factor makes it accessible for all because you may have the best strategy and still loose if your unlucky at the draw. The lurning curve is rapid so everyone can play easely. The digging process realy reflect the frustration that archeologist must face, and are still facing now after unsuccessfull digs. The time track and chronograph to determine the amount of weeks per digs are very intersting and make thebes stand up  alone in it's class.

Thebes est probablement un de mes jeux ou le thème est le plus présent. Une mécanique simple et du matériel de qualité supérieur en font l'un de mes jeux de Queen games favorit. Il y a une bonne part de chance dans ce jeu ce qui peut frustrer les adeptes de jeux de stratégie. Mais je crois que le facteur chance en fait un jeu accessible à tous car vous pouvez avoir la meilleur stratégie et perdre du à la malchance lors des fouilles. La courbe d'apprentissage est rapide et le jeux peut être enseigné en un rien de temps. Le processus de fouille représente bien la frustration des archéologues face à des fouilles infructueuses. La piste de marquage du temps ainsi que les chronographes pour déterminer le temps alloués pour les fouilles sont des éléments intéressants qui font de Thebes un jeu qui se trouve dans une classe à part

Docked a tenth of a point for being too long (100 minutes for 2 players).  But it was fun and I surely don't mind what people refer to as the luck in this game.  Final score was 108-80, so I don't know if the luck could have altered each player's score by a full 14 points each to bring it to a draw.

The upside:
-Very good abstraction of the archeology business. The uncertainty of what you'll find on an excavation and the possibility of increasing your success by increasing your knowledge on the subject makes sense. Can be a lot of fun.

The downside:
-The luck plays too much of a role in this. I'm not sure of it staying at "I can take this" levels.

RATING: 6.5
Interesting game that unfortunately cripples its planning and strategy with a dig mechanic is so overwhelmingly luck-based that it blows up the strategy part. This game could be a 8 or 8.5 with a fixed dig mechanic - next time I'm hoping to try it out with half the # of dirt tiles (8) and see if it helps fix this. And yes, I do mean fix - there is such a thing as flawed design in a game. And having all your strategic choices be wiped away with multiple empty digs, even though you'd invested countless actions and hedged your bets by spending MORE time on the dig, does indicate a large inherent problem with the game design.

The problem I have with Queen games is replayability. The decision making is limited and after admiring the crisp game design, I tend to lose interest after a few games. Thebes almost avoids that. Some risky decisions in taking route cards, some luck with drawing the treasure tiles and a good theme make this one of the better Queen games.

The way that time is used as money to be spent is both innovative and fun.  I love that a person who takes one big turn can still get as much from their game play as a person who takes a number of little turns and it's also neat that the person who chooses to take a bunch of little turns can also get an advantage.  Thebes is neat because it forces players to choose the right time to make their big moves.  

Many people say that they don't like Thebes because there is too much luck.  There is a lot of luck in Thebes.  However, there is a lot to be said for using the time mechanic to get the most out of your game play and to maximize your excavation pulls. Also, a player who is clever about take a lot of short turns at the right time can also gain a huge advantage.  

Thebes is definitely a game of huge player interactions.  Everything one player does affects the other players.  Of course, I wouldn't expect anything else from a game that is about archeology.

Clever archaeology game that uses a time mechanic for chosen actions.
Gain knowledge in the different historical dig-sites, get helpers and listen to rumour. When you feel ready then begin to dig. 
How long you dig for determines how many 'finds' you make. Will it be treasure or just rubble?
Spend time to exhibit your finds to earn extra points.
Plays very well, some luck but that's just like archaeology itself!
Good fun.

RATING: 7.625
This game has a great turn mechanism.  The game itself has a variety of strategic options to add to replay value.  However, the core mechanism of the game relies heavily on the luck of tiles drawn.  This slightly reduces the dominance of pure strategy, but also opens the appeal to a wider audience.  Quiet enjoyable and fairly unique.

Yet another game with pieces impossible to punch out without tearing. One piece tore irreparably, meaning my brand new copy of Thebes is now essentially ruined. WHY can't games come with pre-punched pieces??
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game almost feels like an Amerigame rather than a Euro: it's luck-heavy and more thematic than usual for Euros. This new edition has much improved bits (the excavation wheels that replace the charts, the tokens and draw bags that replace the endlessly-reshuffled card decks), excellent artwork, and a summary sheet that identifies all the archaeological artifacts that appear on the tokens. Although much depends on your luck in being in the right place at the right time, and in pulling the right tokens from the bags, there is still some strategy in the game and you have some control over how far you will push your luck. The mechanism of spending "weeks" to get things done, with the player who has spent the least time always taking the next turn, is great.

Best with two or three players. With four, the exhibitions are nearly useless because there's too much competition for the digs.

RATING: 8
Thebes works very well for myself and my family.  I enjoy the fact that Thebes' mechanics and theme work so well together.  The time track mechanism generates some neat decision points in the game (Do I dig a long time hoping to turn up treasures or spend my time in shorter increments to pick up more cards and score via other mechanisms?)

The components are nice, although I would have liked some larger cards (admittedly, I have huge hands so maybe thats a "me" problem :) ).  There are also 5 bags that you draw tokens from.  

Drawing tokens from the bag is great fun for my kids, and its fun for me as well.  Yes, its heavily luck influenced but who cares - its fun, and it again fits the theme (maybe you get lucky and uncover a great find, maybe you don't).  If you would prefer a little more control over your destiny, then work on collecting congress cards and try to be the most knowledgable in several areas of study.  A lot of points can be scored in this manner if everyone else is a little too dig happy.  Of course, then you miss out on all the fun drawing tokens out of the bag :D.

A deep game with much planning and strategy. Turn order based on which player has used the least "time points" works very well -- great innovation by Prinz that has been copied by others (including Wallace, in Tinners Trail). Digging for relics in a tile bag filled with some zero value tiles adds randomness and fits the theme perfectly. Missions and limited movement each turn makes this a tense and highly interactive game.

Played once.  The game is beautifully and well constructed.  I like the overall play of the game and choices to be made between (and when to) spending time in Europe and at digs.  Victory points from digs are very sensitive to the luck of the draw -- although this can somewhat mitigated; similary having "good" (i.e., useful to you) cards turn up in Europe can be hit or miss.  Overall this seems to have a high luck-to skill factor, but that a one-play estimate.  Bottom line: seems like a good game, but that assessment may change with additional plays. [2009-MAR-08]

I like this game, it has great rule mechanics and features an interesting theme.  Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations and then use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations.  Always gives a fun game.  We've played this a fair number of times but, for some reason, I haven't recorded the plays!

RATING: 7.6
Plays like a strategy game but ends up a luck game that should not be taken seriously.  Probably realistic from a archeologist standpoint but the luck of the draw out of the bag takes over the game.  the rest of the interesting stuff doesn't have much barring.  Very disappointing.I don't mind the luck but it too over powering

RATING: 7.4
It seems like it is a strategy game that ends up a luck game that should not be taken seriously.  This might be realistic from a archeologist standpoint and the luck of the draw of the bag seems to take over the game but  the other options can be a winner such as majority in knowledge and congress.  There is much more of a tug and pull feel to this game than first impressions might give.  This is better with more than 2.  Doesn't work well with two as the bags start to take control of the game.  This is a tactical game that has a little strategy but can really be more push your luck if you want to go that route but you might get burned.

RATING: 7
If you can get over the luck of the draw, and the fact it's a bit long, there's an engaging family game here. You're faced with time management and tough decisions about when to stop gathering knowledge and when to embark on excavations, on the possible rewards versus the cost in time. And while there's no direct interaction, you need to keep an eye on which sites your opponents seem to be favouring with their knowledge, and how thoroughly each has been plundered, in order to make the shrewdest choices for your own expeditions. The kids love it.

Not difficult to learn how to play. Some unique mechanics that make it interesting. I especially like that time is a resource. Multiple sources and paths to victory points, however.

This is a fun game with plenty of theme.  Ignore the issues or "fixes" concerning the random artifact draw; that is what makes this game fun.  Everything else is perfect information...the only thing that you DON'T know is what you are going to draw out of that bag.  But since you can see everything that everyone else has drawn, and there are cards that outline what is available at each dig site, you can use the power of probability to make the best decision as far as location and amount of time to dig. The time mechanic is also unique and thematic. A lot of things come together to make this a fun game that is quite underrated.

I am horrible at time management; I enjoy having to come to terms with that in a board game. The heavy luck element sits fine with me; how many digs are wildly successful?

fun, fun fun. luck, luck, luck. This is a game in which you are an archaeologist digging for treasure. There are fun strategies to maximize luck but it is luck driven nonetheless as you blind draw from a bag to discover how you did digging for treasure. It fits well with the theme though and we really enjoy it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lavish production, beautifully illustrated. Gameplay is fun, fast and thematic. Sure there's luck, but it's presence nicely fits the theme: digging for artifacts is a hit-or-miss affair. I really like how turn order is determined by position on the time track -- again, very thematic. I have a slight reservation about the theme of plundering other cultures. But then, it's just a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.75
The use of time as currency is very clever idea, though at time you can go out for a smoke until you play again.

Then, there is luck... 2 consecutive draws of 7 tiles returned 3 points... Considering the time needed to "learn" then to "dig", totally pointless...

And then again, it is far too long, twice as long as it should be, not that my fellow players were slow or bad, but rather were overanalysing what to do forgetting that it all boils dawn to drawing tiles in a bag (collecting for exhibition is not worth the "time").

It's a game I am glad to have tried because I wanted to buy it. Now I won't. Will I play it again? Maybe, but I much prefer Pergamon in the same category/weight.

This game has several good ideas. First, the use of time as unit for your actions: spend more time for better actions but overall time is limited.

Sólo hay que decir que es un Queen Game; presentación impecable y materiales de calidad. Yo lo considero un gran juego de excavaciones arqueológicas. Sin turnos consecutivos; juega el que va de último.

Luego monta exposiciones y da conferencias. Muy completo.

feels like a nice idea for a game done inexpertly - tension not high enuff - dig mech should be more push ur luck etc

hope will be better with 3/4 pl but will be 7 max

rating after 2plays (4pl) - 5/6

no better with 4pl in fact worse cos if u make a big dig u have to wait ages for others to have multiple turns and u still feel shafted if nothing comes out the bag - not so keen on the time mech as i though i would be - not really my kind of game

Winning this game is secondary to playing and experiencing it. Maneuvering around the map, collecting the various cards, and the idea of the excavations themselves all make a very thematic and fun game to play. Using time as both the resource pool for actions and the game timer, is very clever, and managing time spent versus efficiency makes for consistently challenging choices. While the winner of this game is largely randomly determined by who drew better chits from bag, the fun comes from the balancing act of building yourself up for big excavations- with the hope that you'll be able to get a lot of treasure- and managing your time to be able to do other things as well.

Seems like a lot of rules for a gateway game, and not enough strategy for a more serious game. Doesn't seem to fit a good niche for my collection; it was in about the same place as Downfall of Pompeii.

The game depends far too heavily on luck. You can play the game perfectly and still lose by a drastic amount just because of one random draw.

On the other hand, if you tweak the rules a bit to not put back the first five scoreless tiles (per bag), then it gets a bit better. I highly recommend this variant.

RATING: 5
Not sure what to think about this one. On one hand, it's got some great mechanics, but I think the intense luck element makes for a completely unpredictable experience. 

The components are top-notch with an all-out production value you would expect from a Queen game. The typical score track around the board edge is not  a score track, but a time tracker. This was my favorite element from the game, because it creates some tense decisions. Drawing chits from the bag does, in a way, emulate an archeological dig. In other words, the theme fits the mechanics.

My problem with the game: You're slammed with a double dose of luck. The first is with the cards, the second is with the dig site tokens. There's no way of knowing where certain cards will turn up, and there's certainly no predictability in the tile draws. It turns into a frantic and chaotic game of reacting to all the luck.

It seems like this game would be valuable as a gateway game, but I want something with a little more depth and planning.

Two Player Value = Excellent 

Three Player Value = Excellent 


Note - I have played the original [thing=13883][/thing].  For this writing I will refer to this version as being the first to use these game mechanics for two reasons.  One, the overall mechanics remain the same.  Two, this version is much more available.


Thebes is a fantastic game is just about every way imaginable.  In fact, it is difficult to say a single bad thing about it.

For starters, the game is simply beautiful.  This is truly a lovely game.  Every piece has brilliant artwork.  Even the draw bags are color-coded and well made.

But the wonder of this game is the new and inventive game play.  This game is unique in severals ways.  It is this beauty in design that makes this game really shine.

Thebes is so unique that I can only try to describe the gameplay.  It uses a timed drafting mechanic for set collection.  Then players use the drafted sets for timed blind draw.  It sounds very odd, but plays fantastically.

This was the first game to use the time track as the action selection timer.  This is a brilliant innovation and forces players into tough decisions.  Yet it remains simple and elegant.  It is easy to teach, learn and play.

The theme is integral to the game play.  You get a fantastically rushed feeling as timing becomes extremely important and critically tight.

The rules are written well.  Learning the game from the rulebook is easy.

Honestly, I cannot say one bad thing about this game.   It is wonderful in every way.  This game belongs in every game collection.

Mindenekelőtt előre bocsátom: family game!
Szép játék, ötletes megoldásokkal (pl.: az idő múlása). A régészet "romantikáját" szeretők biztosan nem fognak csalódni benne. Igazán jó és hangulatos, viszont számomra sokat rombol az ásatások során belépő szerencse faktor (a valóság???). Nem tudom, hogy ki lehetne-e küszöbölni ezt, de valószínűleg így kell elfogadni, és megfelelő társaságban eléggé ülhet a játék.

Stratégák asztalára viszonylag ritkábban fog csak felkerülni.

Azt hiszem, az idő múlásával egyre jobban megszeretem :) Tagadhatatlanul nagy szerencsefaktorú játék, de ugyanakkor nagyon erősen tematikus is! A szabályai egyszerűek, a kivitelezés, a design gyönyörű.

So much randomness in this one. But the theme is very well implemented, and drawing random tokens from the bags is so exciting when you get a good one. Its a good time, you draw some cards, move things on the board, draw some tokens, and then somebody wins. Oh, it also has a really awesome time management mechanic.

A great play in the Carcassonne mold with a good dose of luck to deal with and a good dose of options for doing that.  

Think on your feet, do the best with what you get, don't get too upset if things don't fall your way.  Luck WILL affect your score, but at the end of the game you'll know whether you made the most of what you got or not, and you'll LEARN from that.  This is a game that teaches you how to deal with life's foibles and is a fun little play at the same time.  

Very much enjoyed this one.

A light family style game.  The mechanics of drawing from the bags fits really well with the archaeology theme...maybe you find the good stuff, maybe you get trash.  There is a heavy dose of luck in the game in both the drawing and in the card draws but given that it is a short game this is fine.  If you don't like luck in your games you probably won't like this one.

It's a great gateway game ( I can see it being a big hit with families) and I liked it quite a bit but.. I don't know. There seems to be something exciting lacking within the design. I don't mind the luckfest when pulling out of the bags, but I felt kinda bored sometimes when I was standing on a city, a card of said city came up and I took it! And that was basically my action. I love these type of games but I feel like the game doesn't have too many things to do sometimes. I'll play it more though and see what happens.

It's about time somebody put out a fun Euro for a change. This is highly random, but also highly enjoyable. If you play for two years rather than three (as per the 4P game) the length is just right, I think. And the components are excellent too. Big ups Queen games.

RATING: 6
Les mécanismes sont à première vue intéressants, le matériel de toute beauté, le thème présent. Seulement voilà : le tirage aléatoire des artéfacts et des cartes, pour « réaliste » qu'il soit, influe beaucoup trop sur le cours de la partie. Du coup, les joueurs deviennent plutôt passifs, et le jeu se déroule comme un roman.

Le problème, avec les romans, c'est qu'il n'est pas souvent très intéressant de les lire plusieurs fois…

RATING: 7
I really enjoy Thebes as a push-your-luck type game that does have elements of strategy. After playing with more serious gamers, however, I have to say that you need a crowd who likes it when a game is thematic and could overlook a game's lack of gamerly merits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, young-person-friendly game. In spite of lacking much in the way of real strategic depth, the time management mechanic and the (thematic) fun of the chance-laden artefact draws combine to make play engaging. 

I think this is a neat combination of euro and AT sensibility : the theme is great, and although chance will play a big part in determining the winner, decisions feel real and meaningful throughout the game. 

Furthermore, if you're in any way a 'fan' of 19th century cultural imperialism, well, this game really hits the spot. 

Should be sold in museums everywhere instead of the lame 'roll and move' themed games they always carry in the gift shops - except then it would have to be called "The Crazy Fun Treasure Quest Game!"  

Very nice components (archaeological drawbags and Indymeeples) and very nicely priced too. Rulebook could be a bit clearer on certain points, although after a play and a re-read it's all pretty much common sense. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Queen Games version. Much loved by the family with many groans and smiles depending upon the success of the digs. Very thematic - I really dig the digging out of the bags for the artefacts. The turn order is a much liked mechanism.. I've played this many times and look forward to each time it makes it to the table, but I don't find myself ever suggesting it. I have to engage a certain mindset when playing that even the best laid plans will be at the mercy of the sieve and shovel.

What prevents me from enjoying this more is the large impact the luck of the dig has on the scores. Maybe the luck of archaeology is just not for me? I've seen one player remove 20 points from the first dig of a bag (with eight total tokens), and another player remove three points with the first pull of the bag (also with eight tokens). This leaves a somewhat sour taste I assure you. (Update: first pull - one treasure from 11 tokens!) I'm wondering whether the distribution of points should be a little flatter, with the number of total points in the bag remaining the same as it currently is. There would still be the excitement of pulling (say) four points from the bag with a small dig of a token, but it would reduce the luck element to a more tolerable level in my opinion. A balanced game seems best, with smaller digs to leave yourself able to jump around and get opportune cards as they come up. That said, nothing seems to work as well as just pulling the best tiles from the bag.

VARIANT: Each zero blank dig chip is worth half a point (rounded up), and is still returned to the bag. All other chips are worth the same. Yes this affects the balance of digs v exhibitions, but it makes for a more satisfying game. Yes this screws up the theme knowing that when you dig four chips you'll get at least two points, but it makes for a more satisfying game.

Light game with some strategic choices, which can be decided out of luck.   Nevertheless, the game has just the lenght and weight to allow it without taking away the fun.  Of course, it isn't all given to the fortune, cause the winner should do a nice job to be available for the goddess to pick him/her.

I played this at Atlanta Game Fest and really enjoyed it. I didn't find the luck factor overwhelming; just make the best out of what you get. The time mechanism is very nice. You can get twice as many turns as your opponent, but generally you can do less with those turns. Trying to find the optimal balance and rolling with the punches is part of the fun. Tentative 7.

UPDATE Jun-14-2011: Easy to jump back into. Still very fond of the time/turn mechanic. Although I'm beginning to think luck of the draw can ruin your game, overall I'm happy with this game. Raising to 7.5.

I like it. It is an excellent game for those who do not take their game too seriously and are not offended by some luck of the draw (surprisingly the draw bag does not always yield artifacts according to precise statistical chance). It is a lot of fun, the theme is actually well integrated into the game and the time cost for actions is an interesting mechanic. Extra credit for the historical research that went into using and explaining real archaeological finds as artifacts

RATING: 6
Thebes is a fun game, but the luck of the draw in Excavations is increasingly disappointing.

I have a fix for that, though I haven't tried it yet. Ideally, doing more research will get you a better chance to get more VPs when digging... but currently it's wildly erratic as to how many points you get. One player could dig for 5 weeks being not-all-that prepared and get 4 treasures, while another player could have 12 knowledge and dig for 10 weeks and get 1/2 as many points. My group has found that [i]highly[/i] unsatisfying. Here's my suggested fix to make this otherwise very fun game more interesting and desirable to play...

When you dig, you only keep 1 Treasure. If you go in with a lot of research, maybe you keep 2. The more tiles you draw, the better your chances of drawing the high value treasures, so it still pays to be prepared, but if you're lucky vs unlucky, it's only a 6 point swing, not 20 . Ideally, the dial numbers would change a bit, and maybe show 2 values (the number of tiles to dig, and the number of treasures to keep), but since the game's already been produced, here's the Ghetto fix:

When you dig for 1-6 weeks, you keep a maximum of 1 Treasure (as well as any books you find). When you dig for 7-12 weeks, you keep a maximum of 2 treasures (as well as any books you find). Shovels allow you to keep 1 additional Treasure rather than draw an additional tile (or maybe both).

It may be that some of the sand in each bag should be removed in that case... probably about 6 of them. Or maybe not... not sure about that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very fun gateway game with great thematic immersion. The game has an elegant time track design that helps rein in runaway leaders, and introduces agonizing decisions on how much time to spend on digs and other actions. Very tight game design that makes the game just right for the amount of chaos and randomness involved. Doesn't outstay its welcome.

--------------------

My opinion of the game has dimmed a little because you can't manipulate the luck at all when you commence the dig. The capriciousness of luck in two elements: the digs and card draws, can really undermine a lot of the good strategic value found elsewhere in the game.

I think this is a good game, that scales well from 2 to 4. It has luck, but according to most, that can be mitigated by other factors that influence gameplay.

Edit 24-02-08: what an enjoyment this game is. I think my initial rating will be something like an 8, but I suspect it will end up a 7, due to its overwhelming luck factor. Overwhelming... not really... Luck is evened out over the course of multiple digs. But the digs ARE important and other alternatives (like exhibitions) are a bit undervalued (especially those in fact). Still, it doesn't bother game play at all.

Edit juli '09: dropped the rating... do you play the game or does the game play you. Sometimes it's so obvious what you should or shouldn't do, that the question becomes more one of: "do you see it or not".

Okay - back to square one.

- Because I bought this when I could bought only copy of Nexus Ops AH version I've ever seen. 
- it's a MPS

The reason why I'm fine with it now:
- Gave ownership to my GF. Suddenly everything is ok. :)

The game does offer a thematic ride in the broadest strokes and if you really are not in favour of strategizing draw of chips from the bag takes care of that. Actually not bad. Now where to get that damn AH copy of Nexus Ops.

It is a lighter game where luck can play a big role (during the digs), but still I've felt fully involved through the whole game. It plays very fast (first game 2p ~45 min, ~60 min with setup & cleaning).
After 3 more 2p games I still enjoy it very much, it's possible in 40 min with 2p. The rating will not increase for me due to the luck influence.

Rating decreased a bit. I still like it as 2p game (would rate it 8), but with more players it's mostly about luck (it is not the digging that drives me crazy, but the luck with the card draw), especially with 4p I have the feeling that the game is playing me and I have a very little opportunities for strategic play. I would rate it only 6 for 4p.

After the last 2p game I was completely frustrated by the bad luck, rating going down to 6.

RATING: 8
Players are archaeologists travelling around the Greece and the near east trying to dig for valuable artifacts. These give VPs. Along the way, they can pick up equipment to help their digs.

The gameplay features innovative 'time' movement mechanics that are reminiscent of Neuland (Eggert). Players move their 'time' marker along a scale for taking actions (travel, digging, picking up equipment). 

Gripes:
There is a little AP towards the end when players are trying to calculate the best time to spend on digs. It's slightly fiddly; all the site cards are too small and clutter the table. The spread between the value 1 and 7 treasures can make or break the game.

The Queen edition ups the value of the game with the draws-string bags for pulling digs and with the fantastic dig dial! They've made a great game even better!

This game is very fun but initial plays found it very luck dependent.  One person can be forced to move around, burning through the weeks to get meager cards, while others can simply pluck them out of the cities they are in.  Luckily, there are many paths to victory.

The nature of "digging for treasure" in the bags is quite fun and the game is simple to learn.  It makes a great gateway game, in my opinion.

Better than I thought, but I can see why some don't like it for the luck factor.  Drawing stuff out of a bag is just as random as dice or event cards, but I guess it annoys some people.  It's not the greatest game, but it's a good one for certain players.

So far I am very impressed with this Spiel des Jahres nominee.  It remains to be seen if it will have the staying power that Yspahan has with my group, but the first few plays have been a blast. The luck factor is quite high, which can be a little frustrating at times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First, I have to say everything is beautiful.  It is a sumptuous looking game.

I know that there are only a couple minor tweaks in this version, but I just didn't like it as much as the original. I feel that the original game is just more tense and the new version doesn't include some of the advanced rules of the original that mitigates much of the luck factor.  That's not to say that the original isn't a luck heavy game, but I feel that there is more of a choice as to when you should be pulling the trigger to start digging.  In the original advanced rules you don't put in all the dirt until you take out treasures.  This encourages early digs at a higher inefficiency.  Of course, this can be incorporated into the new game.

I don't mind the change from spending two weeks anywhere to refresh the draw pile to a single week in Warsaw, but I don't like that you can't see the next two upcoming cards as you were able to do in the 2nd edition.  Again this can be easily incorporated in the new version.

Other changes that I liked better in the original that can still be transported are the dependence of general knowledge on special knowledge so that you can't use more general than you have specific.  This forces more decisions and makes the game tighter.  The end game used to grant 4 points per special majority now it is 5 to add incentive rather than have the game play compel you.  By eliminating this dependence it also decreases the real need for assistants.

The main reason that I feel the need to hold on to my old version and not get this is the way the exhibits worked.  In my opinion the original exhibit system is superior, it made the game much more tense and demanding with more exciting results.  This new version rewards the player that draws more treasures.  In the other game you can race there with your crap and hope to beat someone with more booty, or just time it right so that all other players are busy.  The new system pushes exhibits out too quickly so that you may not get the chance to even compete.

The new version is fine, but it just feels more dependent on the draws for my taste.

I've never seen the theme and mechanics of a game work so fantastically well together. It really feels like all the exciting parts of being a turn-of-the-century archaeologist have been distilled into this game. Luck is more of a factor than in most other games--it's Settlers-level. I'm waiting for the sequel to feature Nazis.

I've been hosed on the luck (eight dust tiles in a row when the bag was still full of treasure) but I still like the game. It moves briskly, the choices are not always obvious as some have stated, and it's fun to try to put your bad mojo into the tile draws of others. EDIT: I've only played two-player, so maybe it's different with more, but it's kind of boring in year three as all a player usually does is dig and the cards are kind of irrelevant.

I waffle on a rating for Thebes for this reason: I'm put off by the mammoth extent to which your digs are governed by luck, and by the fact that you could do nothing but fly all over Europe giving talks for three years and still come out ahead of players who actually dirtied their hands digging up priceless pieces from far away. At the same time, I love how true to life all of that really is, and at the end of the day the immersiveness of it all wins out for me. 

UPDATE: Why is this so difficult to get to the table?

This game has some great mechanics. I love the turn order mechanism. However, the games I've played so far have been around the 2 hour mark. I didn't mind the random factor, but not for games that take that long. There's more calculation in this game than it appears at first glance. If people don't think during other player's turns then the game is too slow.

I liked this game quite a bit. Sure, there is a crazy amount of luck with draw from the bags, but you can control with investment. The initial visit to each of the sites is HUGE, so invest in one or two properties and stick with it. A great introductory game. Its light, the rules are easy but fun to boot. Recommended for any collection.

A great game!  This has a couple of unique mechanics that combine to make for really interesting, yet simple gameplay.  Anything that you do to help you has a cost.  The more it helps, the more expensive that it is.  The cost is not in money, but rather in opportunity, as you'll have fewer actions to take, and until other players have moved past you, you don't get to take your turn.  The theme is well-done and the components are top-notch: cloth bags, beautiful board, and pretty cardboard tokens for archaeological finds.  There certainly is some luck with regards to the success of your digs, but not to introduce too much randomness.  A truly elegant game.

Good game. Yes, it is fairly luck-based with the draw bags and card draws, but I think it works well as part of the game, and there are still some interesting choices to make.

A bit too true to theme for me -- I don't like the random nature of the chit pulls, although the game has a bunch of other really cool stuff: time management, turn order manipulation, pick up and deliver (sort of), quick play, beautiful production, etc. That randomness just makes me want to stay away. 

-----------
Everyone starts with their pawns in Warsaw. 4 cards are on display. The cards generally show a color of knowledge (1-3 books), but there are other types as well (shovels, assistants, etc.; deeper in the deck, exhibitions). Time markers for each player start at 0 (track goes to 52 = weeks/year; separate track to record years; 4 player game is for 2 years). On your turn, you do one of 4 things:
- take a card from display: travel to that city (1 week per leg) and take the card (paying additional weeks as indicated on the card); immediately draw replacement
- excavate: travel to 1 of the 5 sites (only allowed to dig once/site/year; 2 years in game), use the wheel to cross-reference the amount of knowledge you have in that color (= #books specialized knowledge + #books general knowledge (not more than specialized knowledge) ) with the number of weeks you want to spend ... this gives you a number; pull that number of discs (variable VP) from the like-colored bag, returning any blank ones (dirt) to the bag 
- clear the display: go to Warsaw (pay travel time), discard the cards, draw replacements
- have an exhibit: the 3 most-recently drawn exhibits are available; each shows a combination of discs (varying numbers and colors) and location; if you have that combo, travel to the location, spend the required weeks of time, and take the exhibit card = VP

The player who has spent the least time so far (furthest back on the score track) goes next. The game ends after everyone has spent exactly 2 years. The player with the most VP wins!

Yes it's random.  In fact, EVERYONE gets hosed by the luck of the draw at least once in each game.  It's the person that has the unusually hot draw of the game that usually wins.  Despite that, theme and the strategic plays that you can make make this a winner in my book.

Preliminary rating of 8 after one play -- this one has stuck with me and I'm eager to play it again.

RATING: 7
This is exactly what I look for in a lighter and quicker game.  I'm mostly interested in heavier games but sometimes you're playing with people who just need something that plays in under an hour and is easy to explain and grasp.  This game fits all those criteria but still has some very interesting mechanics and decisions to make and that gives it a lot of appeal in my eyes.

In this game the players play an archeologist trying to find treasure at different dig sites but in order to dig first they need knowledge of the area.  Knowledge is represented by cards that the players can purchase.  The most interesting mechanic in this game is that the main currency in this game is time.  The game ends after 2-3 years depending on the number of players and this is divided into 52 weeks per year and everything costs a certain number of weeks from traveling from area to area to "purchasing" cards.  This is where the most of the interesting decisions come in because you can choose how many weeks to dig at a site.  The more weeks you dig the better chance you have to find valuable treasure but the less other things you can do.

Also, the actual digging is represented by pulling tiles out of a bag so sometimes you get valuable treasure and other times you get useless debris...which goes back into the bag and dilutes the site for the next dig.  As I've already said, there's tons of interesting decisions to make here, it plays really quickly (a 2 player game took us around half an hour and that's including setup, tear down, and teaching the game), and is easy to catch on.  Plus there is a nice mix of strategic thinking with a healthy dose of randomness in the blind digging in the bags.

I STILL can't fall completely in love with a game this light and straightforward, I would probably get bored with it if I played it too often.  But for the right crowd/time slot there's not much better and I really respect the game for that.

Luck or Skill? Bit of both (actually the luck factor is really a probability factor) - if i am going to play a 'luck' game then this is it. Lots of difficult choices - dig, specalist info, exhibitions.  Time system is very clever, careful manipulation of which reduces luck factor.  Mrs Sorp says yes which helps. Plays very quickly.

My third and fourth game have caused me to lower the rating. The luck factor became too annoying and it was obvious after the week 20 of the final year i had no way of winning. Very interesting mechanisms that just don't come together to make the great game it promises. Still, entertaining enough for an occassional outing.

5th Outing and down to a 5. Like the time mechanic, like the theme, but just too random. May be good as a gateway or with children as it has great mechanisms.

6th outing and its gone back up to a 7. Ok their is randomness but it is fun, quick and the mechanics are great

I'm quite impressed.  I like the way the turns work to produce the illusion of simultaneous play.  Digging into the bags for artifacts is exciting.  It is possible to get completely screwed by the artifact draw; that's the nature of a lightweight game.  Still, I'd like to try tweaking the bags - perhaps removing a couple of trash tiles from each one.

I never really believed all the talk about Thebes being a good "gateway" game until I actually played it and discovered that, in fact, it really IS shockingly simple to play!  I also never believed that the randomness of Thebes could be that detrimental to the game experience until I actually played it and discovered that, from the drawing of the cards to the drawing of the tokens, it is heavily dependent upon luck.  With these 2 things in mind, I would have to say that it is a "larger" game that might appeal to a budding gamer, but it is not ideal for a more experienced gamer (although it seems that many would disagree with me!).  My wife enjoys pretty much any game that involves drawing tiles from a bag, but I'd rather play something else.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2.5/5  Total: 6/10

I don't mind some randomness but it can be problematic in this game.  There are times when you devote a lot of time to a particular excavation site and burn up lots of time digging only to find... lots of dirt.  That can get very annoying if it happens a couple times to you in one game.

I really liked this game. The time track mechanic was interesting and relatively unique within my game-playing experience. (I can only think of Neuland as having a similar mechanic, but I'm sure there are others.)

The rules were straightforward and easy to grasp (of course, that might have been due to a good teacher, as I did not look at the rulebook myself). Throughout the game I felt like I always understood what was going on and could come up with an idea of what I should do next.

My main mistake was, probably predictably, misjudging how much time I would need to successfully dig for artifacts. I was the second player (out of four) who headed to the desert to dig, but the first player digging got their nearly half a year before I did and that extra time paid off for him. The mechanism of throwing the junk back into the bag was very clever, although maddening in actual play!

I would definitely like to try this one again. I think I could sell it to my wife too, which is always a plus.

RATING: 8
[Queens Game Multi-lingual 07 edition] {Archeology, gateway; drafting, variable-player-order, luck-pressing; scalable} I got Thebes because it is highly recommended by my buddies. I am not disappointed. It is interactive, very fun and highly thematic. The time track is an original mechanic.  And the mechanics integrate well with the theme.  The random factor in the tile draw may be high but it's fun, balanced and politically correct (how can one know what they can dig from a site in advance?).  The game is medium-weighted - there are meaningful decisions, but not taxing. Besides, it's engaging - the winner is not determined until the end of game.  I like this game very much.

The components are stunning. The board is nicely illustrated.  The cards are effective and thick, though I prefer larger cards.  It's so thematic that it seems I am actually collecting artifacts from various sites. The wheel is beautiful and it's more fancy then looking a chart. In all, a very pretty presentation!

This is an excellent attempt for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

Rating based on one play.

Wow, the luck factor is quite high, but what fun! The theme is really well integrated and actually accounts for much of the luck. For example, invest a ton of time at a dig site and you could still walk away with nothing. We found ourselves making Indiana Jones references throughout the game. Very fun.

As far as strategies, each player tried something a little different... I dug for artifacts based on which exhibitions were coming up, another player focused on lectures, while another just dug a lot in the hopes of uncovering really valuable artifacts. I love games that allow this kind of playing options.

Update: Despite the fun, the amount of luck is starting to get on my nerves. I had to drop my rating a bit.

Update: Traded away.

I was really looking forward to showing off the theme and bits to this one even though I knew it was luck-filled.  It started to balance out towards the end, and the final game was reasonably close.  Tried it out with 3 with a minor tweak of removing one dirt from a bag after an all-dirt draw, but that was very marginal in mitigating luck.

A really interesting themed game - the idea of drawing tiles from bags really put me off initially, but this game is more about increasing the %. Sometimes you get the rough end of the stick, but there is enough drawing to even the luck out over the course of the game. Also, balancing out using exhibitions over digging gives another dilemma. A good family board game with enough decision making and strategy for the gamer. Also, often this is VERY close at final scoring. If I had the time though, I'd still choose Fire & Axe first. Well done on the production though.

Very good game!  Great match of theme and mechanics.  I'm not sure what differences there are between this and Jenseits--haven't played the latter--but if there were any changes for the worse then I expect Jenseits would rate an 11 at least.  Our first game had an incredibly lucky draw at one of the sites--something like 7 out of 8 tiles drawn were artifacts or knowledge--which pretty much cleaned out that site to the point where no one else was willing to try their luck at digging there.

If you mind luck, this game is not for you!  Very thematic though; the action point allocation for the entire game works well, "digging" feels appropriate and suspenseful, and there are lots of choices to make.  Very visually appealing as well, with the nice cloth tile bags.

I like the production and intent of Thebes.  I'm not sure I respect the gameplay.  It moves very slow for what it is.  Maybe my players need to move it along faster.  It's fun to dig and collect stuff but as a whole it's slow for it's lightness.

It's a fun game with a drink in hand.  Yes, the complaints have been the luck factor involved.  When you are lucky it is great.  When you are not it's through no fault of your own.

Certain mechanics were clever like the timer thing. Pulling stuff out of the bag was OK for a while but this is naturally very luck dependent and the game take too long for your fortunes to turn on this. It plays well, little or no rules glitches. Definitely not attracted to theme, but worse is it's not exciting and its not deep. I think we clocked in just under 2 hrs. which is way too long for a game with little depth and lots of luck; 30 min of this would have been fine.

Beautiful design and some nice mechanics (time passby for example). The game flow is similar to "Ticket to Ride" where you have to collect an amount of knowledge before start digging, but with less interaction.

Plays far too long which makes it very dry, and not as theme filled as I'd been led to believe by many of the reviews.  The luck element when drawing tiles from the site bags doesn't bother me (it can be very fun to watch others draw blanks, but incredibly frustrating if you draw loads) however what does bother me is the exhibit mechanic.  The cards can be whisked away so quickly that getting the required artefacts for an exhibition is purely luck based. Underwhelming - I was expecting something a lot more fun and fast.

22-09-08: This game is a joy to play. Simple rules but hard decisions. Enough luck to spice things up. Finishes in an hour. Pure gaming goodness.

29-09-08: After a 4-player game, I've decided that this game plays best with 2 or 3. With 4, there is too much potential downtime. If you did a big dig, like spend 6-8 weeks digging, you'll be so far in front that it'll be forever till your turn comes around again. And if u decide to take smaller digs, you don't get as rewarded with artifacts. In the end, the player who won did two major digs, and spent most of the time surfing his laptop while waiting for everyone else to catch up. It was rather ridiculous.

An engaging game with one one serious flaw: The luck factor is extremely high in relation to the game length, and hits both in terms of what cards are available to players AND in the excavations. High luck factors of this magnitude are a bit more palatable in quick "filler" games. The positives still outweigh the negatives here, though; the game has interesting mechanics, a ton of player options, many paths to victory and a theme that fits well.

glad I have a copy. It not like other games, a mix of skill and luck, attractive and fairly easy to pick up and you get to draw from bags! I would keep it around and this point and play it every six months or so.

I messed up the exhibit deck but it actually made it more useful. I had the small exhibits at the end, but then 3 of 4 people picked them up when before I have seen none.

a) we are playing wrong and we should get more amounts of variety and score exhibits correctly
b) i should redo the deck the same way and encourage scoring of small exhibits
c) i should shuffle the whole deck and let it play out
d) i should shuffle the whole deck and allow people to pick up small exhibits to score later (or lose points) like TTR.

Very theme-rich game of archaeologic exploration. Players try to gain knowledge in western and northeastern Europe to be able to excavate successfully (find artifacts) in southeastern Europe and northern Africa. Players can put on Exhibitions to gain even more fame. Lot of luck is involved, but the game is a lot of fun, which makes up for it. Very cool mechanic of using weeks as currency.

Thebes is drenched in theme:  stunning Menzel artwork, dig calculation wheels, and tile bags filled with artifacts and sand.  Those bags are the problem, because every strategy is reduced to bag pulls.  Thebes doesn't have enough going on once the treasures have been found and the exhibitions have been exhausted.  It's a family gambling game.

I tried to go a little futher in detail, but when submitting it, it told me there is a mistake on the side. So in short:

- Great artwork plus components
- Game turns are innovatively divided (the score track is mainly used to indicate each players' progress - not point-wise but how far they have progressed in the game)
- Luck element adds great fooling around also common in games like Ra, for instance
- Is completely the opposite of a pasted on theme
- Easy and fast-going, yet lots of interesting choices all the time!

In my experience so far, this is the best example of a game where the mechanics match the theme. There's a healthy dose of luck, but if you have the right mindset (namely, that you might get hosed by the tile draws), then this is a very fun game, that is easy to teach and quick to play.

Waited a long time for this game to arrive in the mail (it was mistakenly sent to the wrong address) and am a bit disappointed with the gameplay. I can accept the luck element but pulling the chits from the bag is less fun than I thought it would be. There seems to be little opportunities for making decisions and long term strategies as your actions in each turn are often obvious. Initial rating of 5.

It took me a long time to get this one played. I soloed it to learn it and it felt flat despite the kooky tile draw mechanic.

I finally did bring it out and it was pretty fun. The tile draws can be pretty frustrating so don't play this seriously. 

I believe this is a heavy kids game, with theming and artwork that is somewhat more "adult" (whatever that means) which puts makes it somewhat unique/strange area. I am surprised the game is so well regarded.

It's a solid Euro that does fit the theme very well, which is rare.  You really do sort of feel like you've taken on the role of an Archaeologist.  It's one of the few games where the large luck dependency really doesn't bother me at all, because you're supposed to be digging in the ground, at the end of the day it is luck.

It plays pretty quick and is very easy to learn.

Queen games, as usual, provided solid production value.

The only downside is that the decisions you make are just a little bit too shallow, it's the rare game that I feel could have used an expansion or something to give just little more depth.

Great for families or for a light-hearted 60-90 minute play.

Some nice ideas (like the measure of time elapsed) but the game has downtime because the actions to do are so simple you know really fast what to do but the actions themselves (like digging) can take a long time and the mechanisms permit the simultaneous multiple turns for one player. In a more interesting game (in terms of decision-making), it would not have been a big deal, but here, it kills the fun.

Thebes is a game that I had been wanting to try for a long, long time. It was one of those games on the borderline of my wishlist that I had been tempted to pick up many times, but which I wasn’t sure whether I’d like enough to warrant owning (and the large box size kept it from being an impulse purchase given my small apartment and overcrowded shelves). I’m glad I finally had the chance to try Thebes thanks to Lisa and Brian from Colorado teaching it at BGG.CON. Unfortunately, even after playing it, I’m still on the fence about whether it’s worth owning. I liked it, but I didn’t love it nearly as much as many others that I’ve read. I wasn’t quite as bothered by the luck of drawing chits from a bag to simulate an archaeological dig as I had feared. However, I also wasn’t as overcome with the sense that it was a German-style board game that especially embodied its theme. The time track is a very neat idea and one that’s used to great effect in both Thebes and Red November. I expect to see more games in 2009 that employ this mechanic, and perhaps a whole genre of time track games develop (like the recent outbreaks of worker placement games, cooperative games, and racing games). I’m tempted to pick-up Thebes, but I also fear that it might be caught in the no-man’s middle ground between gateway game and more complex games, just like Thurn & Taxis (although certainly not as boring as Thurn & Taxis). It’s certainly more complicated than Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne, but not a very complex game by any means. I’d like to play it again, which seems to be my mantra for many of these games I tried at BGG.CON (except Boss Kito), but shelf space is at too high a premium to fit Thebes for the time being.

Yes, it has a lot of luck- but so does Backgammon, Poker, and Magic: The Gathering. Played for the first time at GenCon 2014, I was really impressed with how thematic the rules, components, and mechanisms felt. The time based turn sequence, the digging, and the time management required to balance learning with digging is great fun. So glad I was able to immediately find a copy of this out-of-print gem in the Coolstuff booth on the dent and ding shelf.

I knew a few things about Thebes going into it... 1) it had an interesting time track/turn order mechanic 2) that you are archaeologists "digging" for treasure by drawing tiles out of a bag 3) that two people I know refuse to play it.

As mentioned, the key mechanism of the game is that doing things take time. Travelling to cities requires 1 time (a week) for each path you have to travel between spots. Additionally picking up items in places costs times, as does displaying an exhibit in an exhibition, or digging in a dig site. The player farthest behind on the time track is the next player to move. So if you spend a lot of time doing something, it'll be a while before it is your turn again. I love this mechanism.

The game revolves around digging and preparing to dig. You spend a lot of time picking up books that give you better odds of digging at particular locations. There's also books that help you at all locations, but you can only use those up to the point that you match the books you have for a particular place. There's also shovels and grad students that help you dig. When you go to dig, you consult a table (in convenient dial format) that tells you based on your book count, how many tiles you draw if you devote x weeks to the dig. So you decide how long you'll dig, and then draw your tiles. There's something like 30 tiles in a bag, half of which are blank, with the rest ranging in value from 1 to 5 (and in one or two rare cases 6 or 7). And while you remove the point tiles when you find them, all the "dirt" blank tiles return to the bag.

And that's where the issue with the game raises its ugly head and why I know two people who refuse to play this game. Because it's entirely possible for a player to draw a single time getting a 5 point tile, while you draw 11 times and either don't get a tile, or get a 1 point tile.

In our play of the game other players were doing fairly well at getting tiles. And then I tried. And things did not go well. Someone else would draw 4 tiles and get 10 points, and I'd draw 6 tiles and get 3 points. And then I'd draw 8 and only get a book and a point. Given my bad luck, I decided to try to brute force my way into points, where I'd draw 11 tiles at a time. But even then it was rough going. An opponent got 4 points drawing 3 tiles and I got 3 drawing 11. Or maybe I got the 4 and he got the 3. Either way, it was pretty frustrating.

I managed to do well in the game... but that was largely due to exhibitions and maxing out one dig site where I had a huge advantage. And again much of my exhibition score was a lucky break where I happened to qualify for 2 exhibitions (where you display the treasures you've found) that came out in the same location and I was able to swoop in and score them in a single fell. If they had come out a little sooner, or a little later, or in different locations, I couldn't have gotten both. Or if I had found 1 treasure less at the yellow dig site, I couldn't have gotten the nicer one.

So what do I think? Well... honestly. I think the game has a lot of good things going for it (especially the time track) but the randomness of the tile draw makes it problematic. There's a lot of game wrapped around that random tile draw. And while you can try to do a lot to improve your odds, it's incredibly frustrating to have spent a good chunk of time making your odds better than your opponents and then watching them get lucky while you don't. If I'm putting this much time and effort into building myself up, I don't want it to be so easily undone by luck.

Will I play again? I'm honestly not sure. I liked the game. It was fun to play. But it was really frustrating to struggle with bad luck. If the luck had been worse and I was getting nothing drawing 11 tiles consistently, then I think this would have been a miserable experience. Unfortunately, I think that could happen.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=30869][/thing] is a point to point movement, management of time and using the probabilities in order to take the most of excavations, while expecting the least from luck.

The flow of the play is simple: players move their archaeologists through Europe in order to collect knowledge (specific or general), rumors, assistents, etc. Then they go to the archaelogic sites - Greece, Creta, Palestine, Egypt and Iraq (Mesopotamia) - where they will put to use the informations in order to have better chances, for less time, to find the valuable itens instead of worthless rubble.

The twist is the use of time: all actions - moving, taking card, and, mainly, digging. When excavating, using the amount of knowledge the person has of that place, less time can bring greater odds of success (but not a guarantee), and the more time used, more pieces can be drawn from the bag. Regardless of how the time was used, the person in turn is always the one behind in time, which can, sometimes, make the same player have multiple turns in a row.

This is the way the game develops, with the player vyiing for the cards in Europe, which will give them better excavations, trying to make the best routes, and deciding how much to risk in the digging sites - as, the sooner someone goes in one, better are the chances of taking a valuable artifact (but, with less acquired knowledge, more time will be needed to draw more tokens), and the more of these are removed, harder it its to find the good pieces.

Thus, [thing=30869][/thing] becomes a race against time - players want to have the better possible odds before going dig, but this opens windows of opportunities for the others that accept the risk, and if this pays off, the odds of finding the artifacts get lower. Therefore, a good use of time, accepting some risk and calculating the probabilities, are the demands of [thing=30869][/thing] - a game of easy pace that doesn't demand much, but offers a nice amount of varied decisions and lots of chances for opportunity.

Luck is heavily present, still [thing=30869][/thing] soften it through players decisions, and gives use for any type of artifact, regardless of their points value, with the Expositions, along side the points for having the most in each type of specific knowledge. This way, luck is united with the core idea of [thing=30869][/thing] above which the theme and mechanism work and make sense - its a field with few certainties and lots of trial and error; the point, in the end, is not to waste precious time doubing yourself. Recommended.

The "digging" is a very cool aspect and gives you a good calculated risk factor, and I really like the time/turn mechanic. The up-front risk management as well as the research cards help dampen the luck, although it's still got a decent deal of it.

Great integration of theme for a Euro with the digging in bags for artifacts.  I really enjoyed the use of the time track as a pacing mechanic, giving players options on how to spend that resource in exchange for better outcomes.

Will have to play a few more times to get an idea of how to best approach the various phases of the game (knowledge collection, exploring, exhibiting).

I find the luck of the bag draw to be really fun, but it can be a big drag in the later game when there are really few artifacts left and you just draw junk.

Not a bad game, but just way too much luck in the token pulling from the bag.  Unfortunately there's really no way to overcome the luck and improve your odds versus other players.  Of course you can get more knowledge and spend more weeks, but if everyone is doing that, then it just comes down to the luck of the pull.  Why not everyone just pull 10 tokens, add up the total and declare a winner!  Having said all that, I'll play it if in the right mood, but will be suggesting other games!

Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations -- the Greeks, the Cretans, the Egyptians, the Palestinians, and the Mesopotamians -- and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize (this is a change from the first edition's handling of exhibitions). The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.
The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in "time." So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the "time" to catch up.
In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt. When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure. That dirt is then returned to the bag, making the first draw more likely to provide useful tiles.

The game has a very interesting flow, with gather resources, then spend resources.  There are multiple ways to gather resources and multiple ways to spend them to get points.  However, playing it ten times now - all your strategy comes down to pure luck, so in essence, the strategy you pick is meaningless.  My wife will continually pull treasures at a 75% ratio, while I pull out at a 10% ratio.

It was nice, and actually quite relaxing, to play this game with four players. Rules are easy to explain, and components are great. There certainly are some efficiency decisions to make around the clever timetrack. However, luck plays quite a big role during play and drawing chits from the bags can become tedious for the other players during the second part of the game. Also, the game has a maximum of four players, which means that it has a lot of competition on the shelf. No desire to own it, but would play again.

Without a doubt, this game certainly requires luck to win. Luck comes in the form of pulling out the treasure tokens from the bag, but more importantly, it is also crucial to get the right type of cards during the research phase. A lousy series of hands can drown the game. I like this game as is. Its hard to hate this game because the theme is extremely strong and the rules aren't complicated. However, not a gamer's game. I will play i if people ask for it.

I really love it. The timing, turn order and movement system is brilliant. The theme is great, and the production top notch. The high degree of luck is slightly out of balance to the complexity of the game, which, while not high, isn't trivial either. I enjoy playing it so much that I am not bothered by the significant random elements (Digging is the obvious and dramatic random element, but which cards pop up when can have the same or more impact). I was also pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this as a 2 player nearly as much as I did with 4. The 3 player game is still good, but is perhaps less good than with 2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
People say this is thematic, but I disagree.  And even if it might be thematic, that doesn't meant that something that is realistic translates into an interesting game, especially in terms of replayability.

The thing is, archaeologists don't keep going back to a dig site over and over.  They search for a spot to dig and come up with perhaps a lot of dead ends.  But then they find and site and they dig and until they think they're finished.  At no time does dirt/material go back into the site for someone else to then come along and get what was missed.  Maybe this was how it was done a hundred years ago, I don't know.

The result is a rather bland experience.  And I counter that even if it is enjoyable, it certainly can't be replicated over and over.  There are only so many times you can do this mechanic before it's going to lose its charm.  

Strongly prefer the card version which, counter to those who praise this edition while criticizing that one, is indeed more of a game.  Neither is deep by any stretch, but the card version actually has some real decisions and is not nearly as much at the whim of drawing blanks like the board game version.

Very nice family weight game.  I know this is a negative for some people, but the person who plays the best doesn't always come out on top, and I like that in a game.  The new/inexperienced player has a shot at winning unless they just completely screw things up.  Plus, even if they lose, they can shrug it off because it's easy for them to convince themselves that if only their luck had been a little better, they could have won.

We previously owned Thebes: The Tomb Raiders (card game), and I like this original implementation better.  In streamlining it down into a card game, I feel like they took some of the soul of the game with it.  I much prefer "digging" through the bags rather than in decks of cards and I like the feeling of traveling across the map to acquire knowledge or go to dig sites.

Rating after two plays {2p and 4p} I like this game because it is a lot of fun. It shouldn't take much thought and the neat "week" mechanism ensures variable turn order. Well worth the money and the time investment of roughly 90 minutes. 

**Update 2008/02/18** {3p} I am downgrading this from 7.25->7.0 because it goes on a little longer than it should. As an introductory game, it doesn't have a strong "fun" factor. Perhaps it the people I play with?

**Update** 2008/06/06 {1play,4p} Much better with 4. Luck is a strong factor but was able to play in 75 min so that's a good thing. 7->6.5

Egyszerű, régészeti témájú játék, ahol szetteket gyűjthetsz, hogy azokat felhasználva nagyobb eséllyel húzd ki a pontot érő letetet a ásatást jelképező zsákból. A zsákban sok a "nem nyert" token, és azokat mindig vissza is kell dobni, így az esélyek mindig rosszabbak és rosszabbak... a döntés tehát, hogy elsőként, vagy nagy eséllyel akarunk ásatást vezetni, mert mindkettő elég ritkán jön csak össze.
Nem rossz játék, de a szerencse komoly faktora le tudja húzni az amúgy egész jól kigondolt taktikát is.

RATING: 8
Rated after two games. This is a good game, but explaining the rules takes some time and in the end the game is decided pretty much by the luck. The luck fits to the theme nicely, so I don't complain too much, but the rules could be a little bit more simpler. It is of course possible, that after a few games, the game gets better and the luck does not weight that much. We'll see.

Updated after eighteen games, once I learned the rules it was easy to explain them even to couple of non-gamers who liked the game afterward. So the rules are not that complex and do not take that much time. There is still the element of luck, but it fits the theme nicely and it can be little bit controlled by the actions. In the end it is quite a fun game, when players are digging sand and great plans fail etc.

The game is also playable with two players and it's not bad. It's little bit different in nature of course, but still enjoyable. May be not at best with two, but playable.

After the 19th game I changed the rating from 7 to 8, because I really like to play this game. It is relatively easy to explain and quite fast to play. Theme fits the mechanics very well.

Updated after 25 plays, all above is still valid.

Digging through the site bags is a lot of fun also unless you come up with nothing but dirt. *update 6/18/08* 4th play  lost by a point to a player with 6 congresses! I upped my rating to a 9.

At first I was impressed, but with further reflection on my only play so far I'm unsure about Thebes. It seems the narrative arc will always be the same- get a bunch of books first, and then go dig for treasures. With repeated plays it seems that deciding when to make that transition will be the only interesting decision in the game. That's OK, as Thebes is a game to be enjoyed for its theme as much as anything else. I'm certainly not turned off to playing it- I'd actually like to again soon. But as a buy it seems unlikely.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I really like the game mechanisms here.  The use of time as a currency is neat, and the way that it works with turn order means that you can coordinate your moves so that you can complete a chain of events on your turn.  Unfortunately, the game is managed by two random factors -- the card draw and the tile pull.  Managing your resources can help alleviate some of that, and yes, the debris tiles add to the theme, but it's frustrating to see your three opponents draw multiple huge artifacts from their draws, and then you draw the big goose egg on yours.

Also, I'm a little concerned with some players becoming so familiar with the cards in the deck that they know how to plan for exhibitions, or know which cities they should visit to get the cards they want.  I don't think this game brings that much depth to the table, but I can certainly see the hardcore gamers exploiting that aspect of the game.

Still, it's interesting enough and short enough that I will play it again.  It might even get better, now that I know how to manage my turns.

RATING: 8
A lot of what happens in Thebes is luck of the draw, which many people won't like. Normally I'd share that opinion, but so much of what happens is both mechanically clever and thematically appropriate that I just don't care. The primary action is drawing cards, for "study". The more knowledge the card gives you, the more time it takes you to learn it. Pick a deep tome and your opponents will take three or four turns before you get to go again.

Of course, having a boatload of knowledge about the area and the historical era you are searching for provides you with a huge advantage when it is time to go digging. Again, the game thematically shines here. You reach into a bag and pull chits, half of which are just empty dirt. When you pull dirt, it goes right back into the bag. The more an area is worked, the harder it becomes to find something valuable. It's an ingenious abstraction of archaeology...and one you will often curse when you spend 10 weeks pulling 8 chits and only managing to get three fairly worthless artifacts.

So yeah, there is a lot of luck. But it feels completely appropriate to the subject matter. Plus, it's just flat out hilarious when someone strikes out and equally as exciting when someone snags a high value trophy on a one week dig. I think this is one of those rare games that lets the fun out weigh the game's strategic shortcomings.

This is a fantastic gateway game. 

The time track is awesome and I have seen lots of different strategies win because the luck of "the dig" can be a great equalizer. This isn't a game you will play sessions back to back but I am always happy when it gets pulled out.

Its only draw back is its length.  The beginning of the game is just a bit to slow.  It speeds up and there is never enough time by the end mind you but the overall time length makes it maybe to long for our kids to play it yet.

It's fun, but the randomness of the draw will keep this game from ever being "great" for me.  I will say that I am incredibly glad that I sold my older, second edition of the game and bought this one.  Queen's version is a lot nicer to play and the bags of chips are much more fun than the low quality cards of the PrinzSpiele game.

Overall, the game keeps sinking for me.  It is one of those games that was fun to play when I played it, but I just don't see it coming off the shelf again.  Even the kids were kind of luke warm on it, as it is too long for a kids game, and not interesting enough for an adult's game.

Very fun game about exploration. The production is wonderful and the gameplay comes straight out of the theme. There is most certainly luck of the draw (both in drawing from the bags and in card flips), but if you are patient, the luck seems to largely even out over the course of the game.

I think I prefer Olympos over this. The randomness didn't feel fun to me.

A fine game, for sure, but I have others I'd rather play.

Very fun game, but very luck-driven. Just don't take it as a serious strategic affair, as it can become quite frustrating when you keep digging up dirt instead of treasures.
Thankfully, the fun usually outweighs the frustration.

RATING: 6.5
Overall the game is quite straight forward, my main complaint is the randomness of "digging" for artifacts.  While I like the random nature of the expedition cards, and like the strategy in trying to optimize your expedition, somethings wrong when you draw 11 tiles out of a bag (at a high cost) and are rewarded by 2 victory points.  While any game has randomness that will sway back and forth it seems Thebes punishes players much more when randomness is against you than for you.

Looks very interesting and it appears to be getting a lot of good press so I think this is one that we would like to get sooner rather than later.  Huge history buff so this really seems to hit that spot.

Thebes is a game of competitive archeology. Players are archaeologists who must travel around Europe to acquire knowledge about five ancient civilizations and then must use this knowledge to excavate historical sites in the areas of these civilizations. Through the course of the game, expositions are revealed, and an archaeologist who has treasures from the requisite civilizations may claim the prize. The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.

After multiple plays, this game really does shine for us.  It is not my FAVORITE game, but for what it is, Thebes is a winner.  We actually enjoy the randomness, as I believe it goes well with the theme of the game.  The more you research, the longer you stay, the more LIKELY you are to succeed.  Is it a guarantee?  Nope.  And that makes it fun.

RATING: 8
Fantastic early 20th century archaeology themed game. Do your research, go on your digs, and pray than when you reach into the bag, you grab something other than a handful of sand. Then exhibit your relics for victory points. Or you can just be lazy and go on the lecture circuit. Your hard planning can all me wasted on bad luck, so be prepared to have your dreams dashed more than a few times.

The novel turn order mechanic is fun, but only until the first time you have to wait 5+ minutes for your turn to come back as you watch your co-players take multiple turns.  In the end, though, I wish we had more than 2 years to play the game.

I had a rough string of bad luck on my first game, but I had an immense amount of fun, and can't wait to play again.

UPDATE: may 09. Played with 4 and it's a luck game but still great fun.. with everyone chanting dirt..dirt..dirt when someone does a 'dig'.


It's quite a nice game with moment of joy and jubilation at lucky draws and sadness at your misfortune. I don't have a problem with the luck factor, but probably more an issue with it being maybe 1/2 hr longer than it needed to be. If this was a 45 min game I'd probably give it an 8. Of my most recent purchases, I am more happy with phoenecia, which has the zavandor tech tree but the game is stripped down to about the same duration as this game (maybe a little longer). But I seem to have much more *fun* with phoenecia!! Weird. I truely expected an even higher fun factor with Thebes....

RATING: 4
Not my thing, clearly.

Players don't have any significant control over the cards available on their turn, multiple players must be willing to grab "speaking engagement" cards so that one player doesn't score an insane number of end-game points, and there's too much luck in drawing the tiles from the "dig" bags.

Played once (with 3 players). This new version deals with some of my concerns from the old one, and noticeably improves the looks of the components. Of course, the (thematic) randomness remains, but that's part of the charm of this game.

After one play, it's a lot of fun. The agony of digging up dirt and the excitement of getting a great artifact add a lot of gambling in a fun way. The decision to research or dig is well balanced. Interesting to see how well it holds up over time.

It involves much luck, but that is part of what makes it fun. There are different approaches that can be taken to the game and to the opportunities presented. It plays well with two. 

Just upgraded it to an 8. It's just fun to see how it all works out. 3-4 different pathways to winning, a laugh to see how the draws work out. Light, easy going.

After one play I am not super impressed with this game.  I like the novel way time is represented in this game (same mechanic is seen again in Red November).  I also like how time is crucial in determining how your digging actions get modified.

Due to some poor strategic decisions on my part, I would be willing to give this one another go to see if I can improve.

Yes, there's quite a bit of luck, but that doesn't bother me if a game is fun, and this is fun! Unfortunately, it is also too long (with four players). It shouldn't take more than two hours to play this, but it does. I can see the playing time coming down to 90 minutes, maybe, with experience, but not the 60 minutes promised on the box. This will probably mean the game won't see as much playing time in our playing group as it could have.

RATING: 6
I like the theme as well as the great production value.  However, the luck factor in the way the cards can come out as well as "digging" the treasures totally kill the game for me.  It takes zero skill to draw chips from a bag; the fact that I can have max knowledge and time spent at a site yet still end up with all sands is not the definition of fun for me.  Quite a shame really.

Very luck orientated.  I liked the theme/idea of being an archaeologist spending time to learn new skills, perform digs and exhibits.  I liked the time track idea.  I even liked how the digs get progressively harder because the treasure has been taken by rivals.   

What I didn't like was just how much luck is in the game, how much downtime there is and the decisions don't seem that interesting.     The luck is in the flop of the cards, the dig bags and it isn't as cool or as interesting as I thought it would be.

Worth playing, not worth buying/keeping.

Feels pretty luck-heavy, but I enjoy this game thoroughly anyway.  Clever mechanics include "digging for artifacts" by pulling tiles out of a bag--some are "artifacts" and some are just "mud"--and spending an allotted amount of "weeks" as currency over the course of the game.

I rather like a lot of what is going on in the game, but I'm not a fan of it as a whole.  It's nice that you can mitigate the luck in any of several ways, or embrace it, but I was still relieved when it was done.  Fortunately, I was playing with excellent company, so I enjoyed my time anyway.  This should be a perfect game for some folks — not for me.

After 2+ Plays: I think I may have been unfairly hard on this game.  For some reason all the hype surrounding the release of the new edition made me expect a meatier, more intense game.  Instead, it's a pretty lite game of maximizing your probability on the draw, with a few chances for neat tactical plays.  I think my expectations being misguided hurt my opinion of it, so I really think I should try it again.  At the very least the time mechanism - a sort of mishmash of variable player order and action points - is very cool.

RATING: 9
I love this game! You represent archeological diggers in Europe. Players spend the first turns travelling between cities in Europe, amassing knowledge about the dig sites. Each turn takes a number of weeks to perform, and it's always the player who's last on the time line who gets to go. This is a really interesting mechanism.
When playeers have sufficient knowledge for a special dig site, they go there and decide how many weeks to spend digging, and then draw a certain number of treasure chits from a cloth bag representing the dig site. The more knowledge you have, and the more weeks you spend, the more chits you can draw. Treasures are worth points.
Apart from finding treasures, players can earn points holding conferences, or holding exhibits (this requires you to have a certain combination of found treasures).
The mix between the turn system, the cloth bag digging and the different ways to get points makes up for a real fantastic game.

RATING: 4
It's a trick-taking game.  It has nice cards and neat looking "jewels."  Personally, the "theme" knocks it down a couple of points:  take a generic deck of cards, and your learning curve is flatter.  There's nothing special about this game -- nothing more special than, say, Hearts or Spades.  The reason it's fun is because trick-taking is fun, but if you want to paste a theme on a trick taking game, then [thing=20079][/thing] is a lot more enjoyable.  In Dragonmaster, there are 5 "suits" just to try to prevent you from using a deck of cards, but you could make the same game by using a [thing=760][/thing] or [thing=50][/thing] deck, and have a more enjoyable game with a smaller learning curve.

Nice art, the gems are very tactile, and overall game play seems somewhat improved over Coup d&#039;etat - all reasons why this could work well in a family setting. For serious card players, Barbu may be a better choice. Every variant or similar game I&#039;ve seen has enough minor flaws to convince me that there is probably room for a variant with special cards, nice art, and clever mapping of powers to the various contracts - that I would rate at a 7 or 8. Think of Citadels-like role cards that not only identify which contract the dealer has chosen but somehow also can be used by non-dealers to affect play.

I give it a seven because it was my mom's favorite game and I have fond memories of playing with the plastic crystals and looking at the cards in wonder.  Too young to play it with her however.  I need to find a copy of this sometime. UPDATE: Well, it seems like an interesting game, but each had goes by quickly, and the cards are large and not so easy to shiffle, so that can be a pain.  Not to mention my wife HATED the artwork and theme, so I don't this will get much play in the future.

RATING: 6
Great fun in a trick taking game. Only 1 player per round (the Dragonmaster) will earn jewels from the other players by winning certain tricks based on a card he or she plays at the beginning of the hand. Each person is Dragonmaster once, whoever has the most jewels at the end wins! I love the Fantasy art of the cards and I really enjoy the jewels themselves. I can't wait to play this again.

Among my favorite games to play with 4 players. Players take turns as the dealer and play five hands of different games in rotation, taking as many tricks as they can. Points are scored based on the value of the tricks taken. Fantastic card art make this game a treat to play.

RATING: 7
Not so much a trick-taking game as a trick-avoiding game, but a good one at that!

The game is played in rounds; one round per player.  Each player gets a turn at being the DragonMaster, which means, after looking at their hand, they get to dictate which cards should be avoided in each hand.  There are 5 hands played per round, which the DragonMaster choosing one of the 5 listed options for each hand, using each one once.  The DragonMaster gets points from a player who takes a trick containing one of the taboo cards.

So, essentially, the DragonMaster tries to maximize the points he receives from other players, while the other players do everything they can to avoid the bad cards for that trick.

In the end, I really enjoyed it, with the caveat of the custom card ranks being hard to remember.  It would be much easier to have 4 suits numbered 1-8, rather than 4 suits, each with King, Queen, Prince, Wizard, and 4 other cards I can't remember the names of.  Granted, it would be super easy to just play this with a standard deck of cards, but the artwork is very cool!

Beautiful cards that would be great to own, but the gameplay is overcomplected and components are seriously lacking in clarity.

TRADED IT!

I picked this game up after ordering Dwarf King (both games underwhelmed me). Dragonmaster still has some amazing artwork, but feels very dated and does not hold up to many newer similar games. Not really sure what to make of it... it could a much better card stock, but if it ever got a makeover I'd likely think less of it as it would then lose the nostalgia which is all that holds this game afloat.

I can't believe that this game isn't rated higher. This is one of the greatest trick-taking (non-standard card deck) games there are. The mechanism that it uses works perfectly (you generally do NOT want to take a trick) and creates a game that can be tense and nerve-wracking, all at the same time extremely fun and strategic. My only caveat is to recommend NOT playing with the Dragon card, as it seems to be too chaotic and wreaks the balance of the game.

A great game for both 3 and 4 players.

Clever trick taking game.  The power plays, both announced and secret add a wonderful depth to Dragonmaster.  The art work is amazing.  The expert game is the best way to play, but the scalability of difficulty is a nice addition as it allows new players to ease in and learn strategies.  Quick playing, strong decision making, and fun Dragonmaster is a long OOP game that deserves a second look.  

Update:  After a few plays, and the beauty of the illustrations no longer fresh and blinding as before Dragonmaster is really a tired game that is outdone by many other trick taking games. 7 to 5.

I'm not usually one for trick taking games, but this game is awesome. It's like an advanced version of Hearts, with a cool fantasy theme.

The components are really nice, with plastic gems for currency and the cards are printed on nice thick cardstock.

There's also 3 ways to play the game. The basic game. an advanced version and an expert variation. Each version adds a little more to the game, but even the basic version is a blast. There's hardly any down time in between turns, so the game never stall out and before you know it. It's your turn again. There's also no player elimination. Even if you go broke. You can take a loan from another player, but it has to be paid back at game end.

Overall this is an excelent game for just about any type of gamer. I'm very happy to have come across this and to have had the chance to play and am looking forward to many more fun plays.

1.11.18 

In general, I'm a fan of trick-taking games because they're a great way to shoot the breeze while leisurely playing something. Dragonmaster definitely fits the bill here. And in any small silences, you can stare at Pepper's fabulously retro artwork. 

But, then, you realize your game night has been taken hostage for the next two hours as every single player gets to lead five hands as the Dragonmaster. Even worse if you're unlucky with the cards and you find yourself in the hole with little chance to claw your way out. 

That said, I would be interested in trying Indulgence, DM's reimplementation, to see if they modified the game to make it a bit snappier.

One play of the basic game with four. I liked it, but it's quite long for a trick-taking game. Also, I knew that I was out of the running before we were even halfway through, though the advanced game might solve that problem.

RATING: 6
(1 play, 3 players) This is actually a pretty good trick-taking game. There are some neat ideas in it, and several variants (I've only played the basic version). One player is the Dragonmaster each round. He chooses which type of tricks have a penalty each hand. Every time a player takes that type of trick, he pays a fine to the Dragonmaster. (Advance rules allow people to become the Dragonmaster or reverse the requirements of the hand.) After everyone has been the Dragonmaster, the game is over and the player with the most money wins. 
The game plays pretty well. However, the game is severely hurt by the unique deck. The artwork is typical '70s fantasy art, and the cards use a ranking system that requires frequent checks to the cheat sheet. The cards make it difficult to play what should be an easy game. A re-release would do wonders.

I'm not a huge trick taking card game player. But, this was fun (others are too, just not my preference). Very easy to play. We only played a quarter of a game though, so I'll have to see. But I think once we understood it after the first hand or two that it wasbgoing to go quickly.

For play with ylu family you should pull it out and give it a try. Especially if you all play any traditional card games. There are three levels on play. I'd just go for expert play.

An old copy owned by my wife- I finally pulled it out and played it after recovering from her closet back home, and... it turns out to be pretty good game, after all.

It's a short-decked trick taking/avoidance game, with a special deck of Tarot-sized cards (large), custom fantasy artwork (very 70's), multiple hand-win conditions which are each used in a set of five hands, and a trump card (a dragon) which enables some of the most interesting hand options.

The person who is dealt the trump (a Dragon), has the option to either choose to try to usurp the deal by reversing the usual trick avoidance conditions (and taking all of those cards or failing), or taking the widow and returning the Dragon.

If a player returns the trump card instead of announcing a 'Power Play', then the advanced rules allow any non-Dealer to STILL attempt to usurp the deal, but without a trump card, and without ANNOUNCING the attempt.  So in a "normal" avoidance hand, players can still try a Power Play in 3 of the 5 options- and all players have to watch and count the cards carefully to be sure no one is 'shooting the moon' on them.

At the end of a hand, the players pay various penalties for not avoiding taking cards (to the dealer, or Dragonmaster), or for letting a 'Power Play' sneak by them (to the player, who also steals the deal by succeeding).

Oh yeah, and I didn't even mention the cool money bits: stacking plastic gems in multiple colors to track each player's funds. Way cool bits!!!

So I'd give the game a 6.75 initially, but the bits lift it to an even 7.00.  A very cool old game.

The only thing I see missing is that of the bag the the crystals go in (which is very easy to replace however I want to make it clear it is not included and looks to be the only missing item.) this game has been well used from the box to the cards to the crystals. With that being said this is a game from 1981 and while it does show signs of wear, it also shows no signs of not being able to provide many more years of play. If interested in a trade I am more than happy to send pictures and speak with you before a trade is made to make sure you know what you are getting.

We loved playing this when I was a teenager, and now my mother teaches the grandkids.  How's that for getting your money's worth out of a game purchase?

I've been using it as a gateway game for folks who love Spades and other trick taking games.  They are enamored of the artwork and the crystals.  In many ways, it's a Euro-feel game way back from the era when high-Fantasy was uber-popular.

Back in 1981, I was 13 years old, only played mass market tie-in games, and didn't have too many friends who were interested even in those. When I got Dragonmaster for a birthday or Christmas or something, I was bowled over by the incredible art and the cool plastic gems. And found the rules unfathomable. (I was not a patient kid.) I eventually lost track of the game, but I thought about it often once I got back into hobby gaming.

Not long ago a friend of mine had a copy he was getting rid of and I took it off his hands. It was missing a red gem, but one of the few things I still had from my copy was a gem...a red one. I'd held on to it all these years. Coincidence? Or fate?

Anyhow I finally got to play this. And it's fun! We played the baby game without the power plays, and I'm eager to try the advanced game. It's actually a fairly standard trick-taking game, and probably goes on a bit long, and the gems are actually just money and could be anything, and the card ranks are frustrating and confusing, but...it's Dragonmaster! And I'm so glad to have finally played it!

I remember buying this when it first came out, when my love affair with dragons had just taken hold.  What happened to it I can't say, it just vanished from my room in a Mom's-clearing-out-stuff-for-Goodwill sweep about 20 years ago.  A recent (and fairly cheap) purchase off eBay scored a copy in great condition.  Now for the freaky part...  it was my game!  It came all the way from South Carolina (to Colorado), and had my name on the underside of the lid.  Thinking about how that is possible can give you a headache, but it's still cool.

The one real drawback is that it seems to take too long.  Still, I'm happy to play it anytime.

I would say no game contributed more to my upbringing than this one.  I was given an hour of supervised indoor free-time every day in fifth grade.  Not sure how I got the game, but I would gather the same group of four together and we played this every day.  For a year.  There was enough strategic possibility even in the beginner's version to keep four 5th graders entertained and the artwork is truly amazing.

We had a lot of fun with this back in the day.  Besides that, the art is awesome and the plastic gemstones are really cool.  Still, I haven't played in a very long time, nor have I bothered to track down a copy to call my own.  Still, I would be happy to play this if someone suggested it (or if we bothered to dig out the copy when at my parents' house).  At the time we played this, we didn't really have anything quite like it.  The idea of getting to choose the goal for the hand was something unusual (it seems) for that time.  Also, this was the first trick-taking game I really played.  I learned a lot from my dad at how to effectively play and evaluate a hand of cards (applicable in many, many games) from our time with this.  [08/20/2007]

I'm basing my rating here on distant memories. I got this game as a present when it was originally released (and I was a "tween"). I loved it, but had a hard time getting siblings and parents to play it. (They prefer Monopoly.) I had fun playing it, though, and preferred it to any of the household games.

Ha ha! Now I own it! We've played it about 5 times, and while I love the art, I'm not sure that the winner isn't largely determined by chance. The apparent futility of choice means that it's significantly less satisfying to play this than, say, Tichu. We haven't yet played with the full on, advanced rule set though, so perhaps that changes things up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's hearts, plus some fun twists.  

I like the changing rules to the hands, it makes for some really fun decisions.  

You can really get hit hard in this, but anyone can get swamped, so it can even out.  

I certainly recommend using the advanced version over the basic, it isn't much more complex, but it does add a way around having crazy crap hands or being at the mercy of the DragonMaster.  I like games that allow for you to shoot the moon.

Plus, it is cool to play a game with the art designed by the guy that did the album cover to one of the greatest records made -- Love "Forever Changes".

A very cool trick taking game with some of the best $ counters evah. 4 suits, 8 cards in each. Everyone delt cards. 5 goals for five hands (No red warrior, no dragon lords, no wizards, no first / last trick and all of the above). Dragonmaster changes each round (round is 5 hands) and tries to accumulate the most $ during his turn. Once everyone has had the chance to be the Dragonmaster, game end. Whoever has most $ wins. Fantastic artwork. Probably plays best with all 4.

A trick-taking game, much like Hearts, although each hand is to avoid getting different cards.  I think I might even move this up to a 7 if I get a chance to play with the advanced rules, as there's not a whole lot new over Hearts (although I do enjoy playing cards).

This is a decent little card game (or group of card games). The only drawback is that 15 hands are required for a 3 player game, or 20 hands for 4 players, and that is a bit more time than I normally want to invest in a filler card game.

RATING: 5.5
[Milton Bradley 81 edition] {Fantasy; trick-taking; optimal 4p} {Basic 5.5, Advanced 5, Expert 6.5} Dragonmaster is a variant of Hearts with variable goals and special bits.  It is a nice family card game. The ranking of card is unique but it can be learnt in 2-3 rounds.

The Advanced game, to me, is too easy.  The Dragon card is over-power and it is very easy to complete a Power Play for First/Last and Runesword.  I suggested that these 2 shall not be allowed for Power Play.   Basic game is dull, which is only suitable for old times.  Expert game is the only way to play Dragonmaster with fun.  The secret power play brings a lot of excitement.

I had wanted to check out this classic card game for some time, finally getting it on the table in 2010, some 30 years after its debut. My initial observation is the artwork is nice, but not at all user-friendly. For first-time players, the suits are not differentiated well graphically, and coupled with the games unique ranking (king, queen, prince, wizard, duke, count, etc.), keeping things straight was a challenge even for the very experienced card players are likely to struggle with this a bit. The gameplay - a bit like barbu where a shrinking number of goals are available each round - is interesting, but overall the games seemed a bit more fiddly than it should have been. Perhaps Dragonmaster is just a bit dated now compared to the newer generation of Euro card games. I'd certainly play this again, especially with skilled and enthusiastic card players, but it won't stay in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Dragonmaster may be the most heavily produced trick-taking game of all time.  Oversized cards, famous gems, and distinctive 80s artwork all cement the experience.  Alas, it is too long and the complicated cards take awhile for newbies to absorb.  A reissue with tabbed card art, a rotating DM role, and 5 game goal chips for each player to spend would zest it up and allow the game to be shortened with no compromises.

This is a trick-taking game that has some neat ideas, but is sub-par in practice.  The fact that you only have an 8-card hand each round means your options for strategic play are usually very limited, so luck of the draw plays a bigger role than it should.

I also feel that the way that the dragon master role passes around is a flaw as well. In the basic game, a player can know they have literally no chance of winning only halfway through the game, and it can be pretty anti-climatic.

BASIC GAME: It's an interesting concept, which I understand is based on a public domain card game, and it reminded me somewhat of Too Many Cooks, with the different goal cards (though I know this one came first), and Big Two, with the way that money changes hands among all players.  The goal cards give the dealer a certain amount of control over the cards, though the lack of trump in the game means that the other players are sort of at the mercy of the card draw.  The hands are small (8 tricks), but the game requires that each player be the dealer of five different hands, meaning that the game last 20 hands.  The game tends to run a bit long for what it is, but it still has some interesting things happening during that time.  I'm interested in playing the advanced game, since more than one player has a chance of getting money during that game, but as it is right now, it's not bad, but not great.

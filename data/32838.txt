RATING: 8
Massive D-Day game. Borrows quite a bit from the SPI monster Atlantic Wall. Don't unfortunately have the space for a full set up but have played quite a few very enjoyable secnarios including the beach landings in all sectors which can be played very well solitaire.Nice graphics and map although one needs to be pruned. Designer Danny Holte gives great support on Consimworld. Have preordered his new Sicily game on the strength of this one.

Great support from the designer.  I've got to say the rulebook is very well done, it looks like some serious time was put into it.  I can tell that this was a long term development project  because everything flows together very cleanly, and I think that the rules are pretty intuitive.  There is a fair amount of errata, but that is mostly setup positions.  My understanding is that there will be corrected counters, most likely in C3I #24.  Dan chose to keep the rules simple and streamlined rather than throwing in every option in the book, and that's good for improved playability.  For those that like chrome, an upcoming C3I is where Dan will be publishing all his optional rules that didn't make it into the rulebook.  
Be prepared for several companies of American paratroopers to end in the sea.  It's happened twice to me so far.  Phase 2 of the landing can be brutal as that's when the Germans can start replying with artillery.  There are various victory locations so that keeps the Germans guessing on where the allies are going to push.

Very playable.  Due to space I've been using Vassal only; I don't think that I'll ever play the campaign game in the physical world (map 78" wide x 61").  With this out, it may mean that I'll never pull out my copy of The Longest Day again.  So far this is just plain fun.  Pulls the history of the invasion together in a way that books never quite did for me.

The area of the rules where I have the most trouble is attaching artillery to various divisions.  That part just hasn't clicked with me.

Original comments: Seth wants this so I must have it also.  So I can study up and crush him.  Seriously, I love the subject.

This is the Normandy Invasion game I've been playing the last couple of years. I really like it, but perhaps that's because I got to play the Americans. The game gave me a really good chance to think out a strategy and to play it to a finish, meanwhile keeping my opponent on the wrong foot all the time. It really gives me a good period feel, I do consider myself to be in command.
There's also the impact of the weather, that's caused me no end of trouble with turning really bad right after the invasion turn. This means hardly any reinforcements, and hardly any additional supplies. At the same time the Germans get it all their way. I really felt the pressure there, and this added greatly to my enthousiasm for the game.
There are a few problems with the game though. I feel the supply issue is not dealt with as neatly as it could be. Basically there's a massive stock you can access anyway you want until it is exhausted. There's no need to get it ashore first, so supply use feels too unrestricted.
The other problem is playing the Germans. My opponents complained there is little the Germans can do to stop the Allies, other than make sure to have units in the best defensible terrain. Options to use artillery against Allied troops like in The Longest Day are way more dangerous, because of the risk of couter battery fire by long range Allied artillery. This means playing the Germans is much more passive than playing the Allies. This requires really tenacious players for the Germans, that do not mind suffering hit upon hit in order to keep the line.
Still, as I don't mind playing such a role I still consider this a great game that I like to play. I like it so much that I always play with the expansion included.

This seems to be a good game.  Rules are fairly straight forward, but I still found myself having to restack on a couple of occasions due to some rather glaring rule oversight.   Given the size of the game and what seems to be some rules settling on a few fronts, I am stepping back, waiting for the errata to settle, then will launch back in - as long as Normandy 44 doesn't steal all of my attention.

I don't think this will reach a 10 for me, but it would be nice for it to be something that I can pick up from time to time.

The first monster game on D-Day since AH's Longest Day.  The graphics are wonderful, and the gameplay, while liberally sprinkled with modifiers and "chrome", is extremely conventional.  Getting off the beaches for the Allies seems appropriately difficult, as does making progress in the bocage.  Supply is a real leash on the Allies, who must keep a close eye on it, until the mulberries have a chance to get operating.

Lots of counters/5 maps-the 'ultimate' Normandy game? I think so!Plays smoothly, gives the Allies all the tools to re-create history (Airpower/naval support/superior arty/replacement advantage).The terrain,plus a German army that has many reasons to counter attack (no supply cost),make this game feel right!A worthy successor to 'The longest Day'-damm right!

I found this a bit of a slog since there's a lot of fiddly detail that detracts from the flow to me. eg, distinctions between mechanised (yellow), mechanised (blue), motorised divisions and non-mechanised artillery that still uses the mechanised movement chart... is this really necessary?
But I do like the way the landings have been grafted onto an otherwise grander scope standard wargame. The invasion phases with limited movement give a good feel and the right outcome for the invasion.
I will be playing this again, but I don't think it will be a long term commitment.

Acquired during the 2012 GMT Sales. Looks like a simple yet meaty enough monster. It is quite rule-light as a monster, that I like.

[2017] Bumped up to 9 after a team play experience with veteran players. Well worth the time with advanced chrome rules added. Simple yet subtle with supply and command control. People whine about the Mandatory attack rules. I found them good. They force players to understand the terrain and plan ahead where they want to attack. Good rules indeed. 
Remark: the expansion is a MUST HAVE.

The landing process is just a dicefest which adds absolutely nothing to the game. 

The germans have infinite supply which is completely unrealistic. The german artillery firing freely on every turn and the allies have to limit their firing in order to keep their supply?, come on..

Other problems are: The mines dicefest with the placement and movement of every allied naval counter. Fixed ZOC for every unit, even isolated ones. All fixed german artillery may fire as normal artillery 360º which adds to the feeling of a bad simulation.

Map and counters are very nice, though.

This game could benefit greatly of a complete rewriting of the rules, trying to "keep it simple" has not helped this game.

A big playing space, but the rules play like a normal sized war game.  Really gorgeous graphic design throughout and well thought out usability for the components and player aids.  Of course, a game this size is long.  The great thing is that the players fight each other and not the rules which is a refreshing chage for a monster sized game.  I hope one day to have time to play the whole thing, but for now I am content with the scenarios.

Finally got this on the table, I didn't like the landing part of this monster, a LOT of dice rolls to land your forces... the only good thing about this part of the game is that it surprised me that it worked out like the real thing.  Lots of casualties but still managed to squeeze past the German bunkers.  

The game then shines after this, very robust and playable.  So much so, I can't wait to break out the expansion.

If I were to play again, I would skip the landings (which is an odd statement for a Normandy game...)

Easy rules for a monster game. Visually appealing.
The landing-procedures are a lot of fun (at least for me). Seeing the paratroopers scatter all around the marches...
But when it comes to the supply system, I do not like very much the strict MP restrictions (and short range) of Corps HQs to Division HQs to units (the latter really is not that bad).

achieves basically the same thing as Normandy '44, both good (historical/plausible) and bad (ahistorical/implausible).

the difference, of course, is that The Battle for Normandy takes up the larger part of a decent-sized room and takes several long weeks to play, versus the long day Normandy '44 will take.

in this case, bigger and more complicated does not mean better.

My favorite: Grand Tactical / Operational - WW II West Front - Medium  

Plus:
-Accessibility: finally a VERY playable and accessible monster wargame!
-I like the scale; the weaponary combined with the freedom of choice  due to space gives a magnificant feel
-Theme: best of the Western Front
-System: very straight forward and some call it conservative; only few phases that one can think it can't be right for a monster game on this scale, certainly not with a game on Normandy with all it's odds & ends.
Well, Don manages to do what Craig Besique is notorious for: he manages to let you focus on strategy without 
getting you bogged down in endless procedures and phases. 
-Excellent customer support by designer
The different weaponary, HQ-, sea- and air rules combined with a varied landscape already take care of a lot of variables. 
It really takes courage and design intelligence to streamline such ambitious and detailed project. Most designers tend to 'over' design with additional process and phases to cover 'every' aspect.
-Epic proportions but a teenager is able to play it!
-High quality components
-Otstanding reply value, provided you have some space.

Minus:
-Villages are depicted as dots and this really bugs me. June 6 got this right on their maps
-The odds for bad weather are tremendous and a huge advantage for the Germans. Play the historic weather first as it might become frustrating playing such intense and long campaign only to find out the you lost as Allied player because the weather sucked...
-Some discrepencies in the OOB and counters but C3i volume 24 fixes this
-The rules are not clear but 2nd editions rules that come with the expansion will hopefully fix this.
-Mistakes in short term planning early on can ruine the whole campaign on the long run (especially true for the Germans, don't burn your Panzers too early).
-Setting up two map scenario's will take at least half a day so budget time for set-up 

What is not too like? This is kind of old-school hex & counter anno 2009 in a way that it only has few steps per turn which is very untyppical for a game of this size.  
Rules are not sufficient as it leaves you looking and looking again for certain situations but I let my own inuition take over and do what I think is logic to cover this. 

As Allied player you have to use your CSP (combat supplly points carefully). If you burn to much too soon you run out of steam. 
Same is true for the German's; you have some excellent units that you can use to hit hard early. The danger is that you burn them and only find yourself out of Panzers when you really need them.

This game has it all and in very comprehensive and intuitive fassion which is a real good thing if you can live a rulesset. 

Clipping 2500 counters is a daunting task but for this game absolutely worth it imo.

Can we re-visit the glory of "Fortress Europa", fun while elegant Monster game.

The largest game I have in my collection on the Normandy theatre, one that which I am not so interested in before.  With so many tactical level games (ASLSK, BoH etc.) on this theatre plus the ever challenging Company of Heroes PC game specifically on this, my interest grows as to how fierce the German defense could be.  With approx. 2,500 counters and 5 maps, this should be the definitiive study on the campaign.  I look forward to play the campaign game with this one, perhaps when I can get a larger wargamer room first.  

We have a 6-players game. We set scenario 3.0 Cobra up in two hours. Played it through the first whole day in one turn. The whole scenario has 6 days. Truly a monster, playable game mechanics but too many counters even for team play. Can't be possible to complete the scenario in one day.  The German just keeps beaten up by the Yankees in a major delaying action to prevent the U.S. from exiting 9 units off the map to the south. Once they are on the highway (and only highway, not primary or secondary road), they can use strategic movement to exit off the map.  To use strategic movement, there should be no German units within 3 hexes on the movement or mechanized movement phase.  German units can also use strategic movement but they would be attacked more easily with +1 DRM on the CRT.     

A day is divided into night interphase, AM, PM turn.  The game has a pretty standard I-go-U-go system.  Stacking limit is 6 stacking points per hex.  The Allied performs the movement and combat first and then the German does the same.   The Allied have Armed Recon Air Phase at the end of the German turn.  It is a type of direct air attack against a particular unit with a to-hit roll according to the Armed Recon Chart, whereas the Allied has the air superiority throughout this campaign.  ZOC is locking but you can leave it with +2 movement points cost.  You cannot move a unit from an ZOC to another ZOC of the enemy unit.  When the German forms up a defensive line, it is quite hard for the Allied to push through unless they can establish a hole in it for the units to go through.  The Allied has the numerical advantage in terms of men and materials but the bocage terrain gives the defender –3 DRM in combat.  Most of the time therefore the Allied has to use air ground support to neutralize the bocage defensive bonus with –3 DRM.  Air points, however, is in short supply after the German anti-air commitment, the deduction of the German air points.   

There are two types of supply – general and combat.  Units trace their supply to Divisional HQ within 6 hexes, in turn the Divisional HQ trace its supply to Corps HQ within 20 hexes.  A Corps HQ can trace any length to the supply source.  Usually units would go OOS when they loose touch with their own Divisional HQ in a too forward position.  In scenario 3.0 Cobra, the Allied has double the no. of units that of the Germans, many of which are reduced in the beginning.  A largely frontal assault, the Allied takes the time to stroll through the bocage (-3 DRM) in order to exit 9 units to the south in order to win.  The Germans certainly feel the pressure and often seem to be on the verge of a breakdown, only finding the scattered reserves arrive to plug the holes just in time.

The Battle for Normandy is a game to study, to a large degree it is a pleasant and engaging experience.  The map and counters are gorgeously and painstakingly taken and  contrast with each other very well.  Each division has its own color band on the counters to facilitate the HQ supply and artillery support fire.  Artillery can fire in the offensive or defensive phase but the Germans would receive counter-battery fire from the Allied.  Overall, it is a very historical game, detailed OOB, airpower for interdiction, strafing, artillery and counter-battery, headquarter and supply.  If you are into the D-Day campaign, this is surely the game for you to invest your many hours and still find yourself enriched every time you take it out.

The landing phase is quite detailed and takes a lot of time. Play after that is quicker. The game offers a lot of detail (single companies, artillery spotting, bridge repair/destruction, etc).

I am still trying to wrap my head around the rules for attachments, supply and replenishment. The rules itself are not complicated but implementing them does not seem straightforward. 

I am torn about the rulebook. It's laid out well (and is only 20-odd pages long), but a lot of special rules seem to be hiding in completely different sections and paragraphs.

RATING: 8.5
I'm very conflicted about this game, as it's mostly good. Fairly stream-lined for a 'monster', the invasion, supply, combat, air sub-systems, are all good. However, the Mandatory Attack rules, not bad in concept, have been poorly thought through and lead to some odd and gamey situations, and seriously detract from the game. 

In our one play we found several issues with missing rules, several counter issues (but not excessive for such a large game), and a major map printing gaffe. 

[Update 2013/05/25] The Expansion tidies up a few issues in the rules, but there are still some odd situations that can appear. Overall, I'm grooving on this, and upped my rating a full point.

Beautiful maps and massive amounts of counters make this a true monster game about the Normandy invasion.  The rules aren't as complex as I had been led to believe and the gameplay is pretty good.  My only problem is that the set up time is lengthy and if you roll bad on the weather the first few turns the invasion gets crushed and it's back to the drawing board.  It looks like this would be a great game for team play.

RATING: 7
Maps and counters are superior. Rulebook is short and easy to learn. Best with 5 players, works with 3. Out of supply units defend normally, forever, and never surrender, ever.  Units surrounded and attacked from all sides defend normally. Germans tend to get cut off and surrounded, and then sit that way for day, after day, after day.  Weather chart appears to assume that the weather could have been much worse than the bad weather the Allies actually had.  Typical Normandy summer weather is impossible to achieve.  Historical summer 1944 weather is possible, and worse weather is quite possible.  Allies appear to benefit from making many, many unsupplied attacks, which wear down the Germans, who can't afford to trade casualties.  Armor divisions are fairly weak, although the combined arms modifier is very important. Optional rule to allow attacks of empty hexes is important and needed.  Update: Be sure to check out updated rules from expansion, which are quite helpful.

Involved at a convention as a full-time spectactor for a day during the landing phase (wanted to join at earnest as 5th player after the 6th June special rules are gone, but got out because 4th player combination seems better to fit regarding forces and table space) and then later occasionally looking for next two days.
My fear is that the lull phases between offensives are too boring, perhaps game only suited for scenario play. Some sort of aggregated move/fight between the detailed played out offensives would have been helpfull, only to be learned by those wanting the campaign.

Major balancing issues make this game a frustrating experience. The game seems to be pretty balanced till mid-July, but then it just becomes a fantasy experience.

The system is fun and engaging but there are just too many issues. I searched various websites high and low but none of the players seem to have any solutions for these problems: Artillery, Boscage, Air Modifiers, Night Bombardments, Replacement System where common tanks become Tigers and Panthers, Germans have endless amounts of supply, Heavy (And unrealistic) reliance on Mulberry harbors (Historically they weren't that important, the Americans never rebuild theirs after the storm and still managed to ship the needed amounts of supply) ... many more problems

All the AAR's found online seem to end mid June (most even end sooner than that) so there is no way of getting a clue there. The problems remain.

It's pretty good, quite honestly.  I have to mention though that the rules are not written as well as they could be.  Not that I could do a much better job, mind you, just that they are a bit confusing as written.

Some rules need to be polished.  For example, a retreat roll against a strongpoint results in a 3 level strongpoint being removed just as if it were a level 1. Instead it should be reduced by 1.

The weather roll is also open to too much variability.  A storm roll virtually guarantees a German victory, and the -1 to further rolls makes this worse.  I would suggest that after rolling a storm roll the next turn the roll should be at +1.  This would not only be more realistic from a weather standpoint, but also be better for the gameplay aspect.

Finally, the CRT leaves a lot to be desired.  The biggest issue is that if you have a 1-step infantry and I attack it at 5-1 odds, I may get a result of say 3 hits on you and one hit on me.  However, with the very same roll at just 2-1 odds, I would have scored 1 hit on you and none on me.  There needs to be a safeguard in the game to discourage this result, since the rules do not account for "overkills".

UPDATE:  Had to drop my rating another point.   CRT issues are just too overwhelming.  Additionally, the way in which artillery "refreshes" doesn't make for a better game; rather it promotes a tit-for-tat approach from the German side, with each side pot-shotting each other in the evening.  

I really want to like the game, and while I wouldn't call my 30+ hours playing it a waste, I think there is definite room for improvement.

Lots to like about this game.  Once the special invasion turns are done with the game is quite easy to play.  5 maps and lots and lots of counters menas that this is a monster.  But it is very playable also, especially once the troops have landed, it then becomes a very traditional hex and counter wargame..
Looking forward to the expansion as well.

I have a few monster games and for the most parts I buy them to appreciate but not expected to play.  This one calls for an exception and true to Dan Holte's words TBfN is grand in scope and yet very playable.  New players get hands on quickly with a short rulebook and clean game system.

However production and proof reading is a mess with numerous counter and rule erratas but this does not distract TBfN from being the new definitive monster game on D-Day theater.

FANTASTIC GAME!  A very playable (and enjoyable) monster.  It is a monster just from the sheer size when you play the whole campaign, not from the rules complexity.  And there are three scenarios which use just one map.  The mechanics are relatively simple, but make you manage your forces as in a realistic manner.  The supply rules and step loss/replacement rules in particular are great, not at all cumbersome.  Plus the maps and counters are gorgeous, while sacrificing nothing in functionality (unlike other companies games).  All in all a fantastic game.  This now becomes THE Normandy game period, not just the monster game on the subject!

Excellent material but rules are unnecessary complex (e.g., attachment rules) and poorly tested (e.g., consistency between game counters and activity limits; forbidding EZOC to EZOC movement while giving full-effect ZoC to all units, including artillery etc.). Some rules update may make it a good game, but design team seems very conservative.

Additional comments. Let me say that the designer does give some support for rules questions and has even acknowledged the need for additional examples in rulebook & more play-aids. Yet what is needed is a complete rewrite of whole sections of the rulebook like artillery support to make it plain and understandable. Current layout is still recursive: one section refers to another which itself refers to another... We are nowhere close to a end-user oriented work.

Besides, game mechanics lacks fun, as a consequence of the attachment and sticky-EZOC rules. One 10-rating says the game "manages to let you focus on strategy without getting you bogged down in procedures", which is plain untrue: one keeps checking for attachment lines ("do I have a corps HQ to make this 2hex-against-1 attack?") & limits ("how many corps unit have I attached to this div HQ yet?") & mandatory attacks ("do I have enough spare artillery to make "diversionary shot" at those hex I need to attack because adjacent to my main thrust? Oh, and can I attach those artillery?") & supply. In other words, all is built in to distract the player from the operations. 

Admittedly, this may change from June 15th or so when counter density has increased so that all is everywhere attached and in supply. But that's already 30 turns into the game - or more than 100h of play...
(Don't trust any reviewer that has not got further than the first days!)

Sticky EZOC and no-attrition-when-oos lead to gamey tactics. Any surrounded unit keeps full defensive strength as well as a fully effective ZoC, yet attacking it costs supply (which is scarce) and CRT does not make it risk free. The best play is then to surround the unit with slow movers (e.g., artillery units, which you have too many to supply anyway...) rather to attack. Although this is by far the best usage of the units, it goes against any realism.

Overall, I believe the community cannot have a definitive opinion yet, primarily because no one is close to have played a full campaign.

One of the finest games ever produced and a replacement for the Longest Day(AH).

The options are endless and Vassal makes it playable with anyone.

I will begin Vassal play of this one in Spring of 2012; So far, I like the fact that it is a monster game but has only 25 pages of rules. Finished this one in December of 2012 after 6 months of play via vassal. Liked it very much and will try in future to get back to it.

Played at "Game On con" in Seattle the campaign. Love it. 

Did take a couple turns to get use to the "mandatory attack" if your unit is in the open. My Commonwealth 6th Para Red Devils learned about that the hard way. 

This mandatory attack can be satisfied with a artillery drop but they were out of supply at this point so couldn't call it in. 

This causes people to actually get their troops from terrain piece to terrain piece much more than say Europa. Some of that can be explained away due to scale some just shows how much better of a game it is. 

The beach landing are done in company level then it smoothly transitions to battalion levels. I really enjoyed the landings. Some might call it fidly but I liked how it was done. It shows just how complicated the beach landings were. 

The game I played Omaha had it extremely tough. June 9th is when it finally got a single hex beyond the beach. This caused a backlog of units trying to get ashore. Next time might say we could use the optional rule of having the units able to land and the various beaches. 

What won the game was 101st, despite over 50% casualties on the drop!, landed at Carentan with a few units. Held it long enough for back up to show. They were finally pushed out but with armor pushed back in. Giving a major victory by June 9th earning us 4 points per city hex.  

Fun game. It's going to be hitting the tables quite a bit at my house.

I got it off of War gamers Marketplace a Facebook group  complete, only game I owned that the base game is completely clipped,  This includes the expansion(not clipped) and inserts/counters from C3i #24(not clipped).  I did get it for a fair price, but I would never get another game clipped if I have a choice and I can afford a non-clipped version.  I will try to get an unclipped version of the base game at some time if I can afford it.  Gameplay is very similar in some ways to    AH The Longest Day, which I own and have played.   Still a great deal of fun,  like most GMT games I find the rulebook to be the games biggest weakness, with some things I have questions about.   At least today, we have BGG/Consimworld(when it's working) to ask questions about the game.  The rest of the components are top notch and I look forward to getting a lot of plays out of this game, just not the campaign game, not enough space. :)

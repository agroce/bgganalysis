RATING: 7
I might be a bit partial to the theme - I love penguins - but this game turned out to be a very nice filler. Really easy to learn, plays fast and it can become quite evil (in a good way, of course). It's more about trapping your opponents and keep the most of the board for yourself than just accumulate more fish, and in its simplicity this game is more subtle than you would think at first. Compared to the game itself the setup takes time, but it’s really nothing to worry about (just prepare the board all together).
Oh, and the official "Pushing Penguins" variant is a must.

Phalanx Games version, good components.

Simple little game.  Rating based on one session of 3 x 4 player games.  It was surprisingly cuthroat and evil.

After nearly a hundred games on Yucata, finally played this with my kids. The penalty rules of them starting on 3s and going first worked really well and they won. Also it was playing with the delux edition which is a great improvement.

Played quite a lot more and upgraded to an 8.

Fun little game that plays quickly. Players move their penguins to different tiles while only moving along a straight line. When you move off a tile, you pick up the tile and get points for however many fish are on it. When players can no longer move, the game is over and the person with the most points wins.

Plays great with 3. With four there is a lot less strategy but it is still fun.

This is a penguin game, you eat fish and while eating the ice melts, thus changing the shape of the board. Whomever eats the most fish wins. Game play is simple but fun. I could play this game multiple times and not be board.

I rated this as a 10 because I literally always want to play it.

I like the concept of Go, but HATE the length and endgame turns.

This is perfect, I taught this to my young niece, and my grandma. (Both of which don't play games as often) while playing 2 player I gave them both 3 penguins so I could play aggressively (teaching the art of surrounding) and have them almost win.
If I have my way I'll play once a day for the rest of my life.

Simple light tile-laying with a solid theme.  This is definitely a tactical game, and I like the theme.  The problem is that it really does take about as long to set up as it does to play, and there really isn't that much game in there to make it worthwhile to set up very often.

[I]tl;dr - Hey! That's my Fish is a filler classic that's dead simple to explain, but maybe more fiddly to set up than it's worth.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Players move penguins around and pick up the tiles that their penguins leave behind. Every tile has one, two, or three fish on it. At the end, total up the tiles you have collected and the most points wins. 

This is a quick game that's about strategically blocking other players and trying to get as many three-fish tiles as you can. As you pick up tiles the map quickly gets holes in it, and it becomes easier to block others from encroaching on fish that you want. 

I find this a solid game, but it's a little too random with more players -- I find it a better two-player experience. Also, the setup takes as long as the gameplay -- [thing=169654][/thing] is a much better filler game that's quicker to set up and just as easy to explain.

More strategic than it appears, yet playable by very young children.  There is an engineer in our group that seemingly cannot be beaten (by any of us), so we don't play it much when he's present.  He must have figured out something we haven't seen.  My tip?  Carve out a section to isolate one of your penguins.

You have to love the Penguins in this game. Do I go for more fish and risk losing the penguins to the other cunning player or less fish and attempt to eliminate the competition?

Man, I like this game! The single and only downside to it is the set up, but I'm getting pretty fast at that now. The single largest bonus is the speed. It plays incredibly fast (in maybe 15 min) and has this simple, 30-seconds to explain, rules system that gives a very nice abstract-type strategy - except it covers what might be otherwise bland with a sassy, shiny theme of penguins sliding around on ice. Perfect!

As a side note, the fancy penguins in the deluxe version are well worth it!

Hey, That's My Fish is a really neat game. You have to appreciate the amount tensions and agonizing decisions that have been packed into a game that plays in 10-15 minutes. Every turn you're have to value different trade-offs while worrying about not being shut out by other players or not painting yourself into a corner, unless that secures you the whole corner. This is really the meat of the game. Another good thing is that usually when one player finds himself in a situation in which there is simply nothing more to do, the game is already very close to the end. 

I like the balance between the need to rush vs. playing safe. Moreover, it is amazing how in a game that is so fast and tactical, you can even try to execute some longer term strategies. Plays well with children as well.

However, after several plays the game can get a bit repetitive, i.e., it is always the same kind of situations you face. But I do not mind, since the game plays so fast.

Very quick game, great as a filler, and with many strategic choices. Highly recommended.

I do not understand the hype around it. Well, not bad, but too abstract for a gateway game, and too evil. I mean, the best way to win to squeeze out and paralyze the others' penguins. That is not very much appealing for a non-gamer, I guess.

Smashing game to play with kids from about aged 4.  They'll love it and so will you.  It's got easy rules, but there's a fair bit of simple strategy in it and it's cute to look at.  You can really think hard about what you're going to do, but it's better to play fairly quickly, of course.  And it's easy to do variations by playing KO - 4 players start and the weakest drops out each round until there's 2, or by varying the initial tile set up.  I reckon it would work great if you made extra tiles, too, and you could even have a few different fish values in there - lots of scope if you want it...BUT this game works brilliantly as it IS.

Great little game. The assertion that it takes longer to set up than it does to play is humorous exaggeration, yes, but it's close to the mark, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Fast-playing is awesome = more games played. 

As it is, though, this is a super-good game to play with the kids. They love to be in charge of the set-up. The production values (those plastic penguins!) are comically through the roof. My only quibble, and it's niggling, is that it only plays up to four, which is too bad.

RATING: 7
Kind of wish we had the version with the bigger tiles vs. the silver line, but still a fun game.  Only downside is that it often takes as long to set up as it does to play.

This is a quick little abstract strategy game with a quirky theme. I love how the early game is a race for the best tiles, while the mid and late game quickly becomes a strategic blocking game as you seek to capture as many of the one-fish tiles as you can before floes get cut off permanently.

What a little gem of a game.  Plays in about 5-10 minutes and is extremely easy to teach.  It is deceptively strategic despite its cutesy theme of penguins.  I have been playing it about 5 times a week and often play it on my phone as well.

The only reason I am not giving it a 10 is that I dislike playing it with 4 players.  I think it is the best at 3 players.  It is a great introduction abstract game that I throw on the table with people who have played chess or checkers.

A fun abstract strategy game. The goal is to gather as many fish as possible while cutting off and isolating your opponents on ice floes. My only complaint is the amount of time needed to set up the game.

Super simple, super strategic! Like many abstract games, it's very easy to make a mistake and be unable to recover from it; however, the game is over so quickly that you don't really have much time to mope about the agony of defeat. Two annoying things about this game: it takes about as long to set up as it does to play (which isn't much time, in either case), and it's quite easy for butter-fingered players to knock the flimsy ice floes out of position.

A light strategy game with a little bit of mean mechanics as you block your enemies penguins. It plays in 10-15 minutes and the only drawback is that you have to put the tiles in order every time.

A great little game that acts as a good filler for either the beginning or end of a game night. The main downsides for me are the set-up time (a pre-printed sheet to speed up the hex placement would have sped things up) and the limitation to only 4 players are what I see as the drawbacks. But for the price and the quality of the components it's a great addition to any board game collection.

This is a work of mastery game. The only motive I don't rate it higher is because a game to be perfect must have more things to do/worry about than only moving your penguin. 

But on its proposal, the game is perfect! The balance is great, the replayability is very huge, since every game has a new map, and the tactical positioning is one of the best I ever seen in a game.

8/6/11 - Picked this up at the Mayfair booth at Gen Con.

8/12/11 - I'm going to have to say I really like this game after playing it just one time. It's so much fun when you can catch one of your opponent's penguins on an ice floe that allows you to leave them stranded! This is going to be something I'll regularly play. 

The version I have has the fish printed on both sides of the tiles, but I don't think it's that big of an issue at all. I'm also very happy I picked up the Mayfair Deluxe version for $12 instead of the Fantasy Flight version for the same price!

Not a children's game.  Very calculated.  After the first few moves, you can often simply compute how many fish you will gain by moving before your opponents in each of several areas.  Of course, multi-player games are generally unsolvable, but you can make very tight worst-case bounds.

i hate to be critical of such a fun-seeming game, but after some plays on bsw i'm glad i didn't buy a copy.  i know people say this about several games, and i usually find it to be false, but i think this one could really take longer to set up than it would to play.  furthermore, i'm not sure how much game is left after setup among roughly equal, skilled players.  especially with 2p.  games like these seem born to have turn order issues.  i'd still be glad to give it more of a shot, but it doesn't look like it could have long-term value for me.

Fun spatial game which is a lot less innocent than it originally looks, you're placing and moving your team of penguins around to try and score the most fish, and also want to position yourself so that if you do get isolated on an ice floe, you are reaping a lot more points. I got this AFTER Battle Sheep and Crab Stack, but it's certainly in that same entertaining wheelhouse. Recommended.

Great game. Although the set-up is a bit annoying, the game plays fast and has interesting decisions. Very easy and simple game to play - you try to get to the best spots (more fish) before your opponents do, and trying not to get blocked by the other players, unless of course you become blocked in a favorable position. Works well with 2 players, but maybe with 3 is better. With 4 players it's very messy but good anyway. A good game for non-gamers perhaps.
The deluxe version features nice plastic 3d penguin pieces, and bigger tiles.

Initial Impression: This is a wonderful little abstract game with amazing components (the deluxe edition) which seem to turn heads and suck people into the play. My daughter often requests this game and does extremely well. When played seriously, the game is highly tactical and can be very cut-throat.

10 Plays: The delightful components draw us into this game. I'm lucky to own the Mayfair edition with the large penguins. I'm finding that as my my daughter is becoming more comfortable with board games in general, she's becoming more vicious at this game and is providing some serious competition to myself and other opponents. I'm looking forward to the next 10 plays.

This rating is only after 4 plays.  So far I really like it, and I suspect that will only increase.  As a result, my rating may actually increase.  Simple to teach and fun to play; you can knock a game out in like 5 minutes if you really wanted to.  Perfect game to end game night on.  You can even fit all the pieces in a bag, so you don't have to lug around the huge box.  

Plus it has penguins.  Who doesn't love penguins?

UPDATE: After numerous plays, I bumped this to a 9 (from an 8).  There's potential for this could become my first 10 rating.

UPDATE (07/01/2008): My enthusiasm for this one has waned a bit.  Still a solid game, but the desire to play it isn't as strong as once it was.

This is an instant hit with my 13-year-old.  She hasn't beat me yet, but she enjoys the game enough to keep trying.  Since all tiles are visible from the start, this game is almost straight strategy.  It's quick, simple, and fun.  What's not to like?  Unfortunately, the setup almost takes longer than playing the actual game and removing tiles can be very hard to do without messing up the alignment of the other tiles.  Those two gripes aside, I really like this game.

Good small game with more to offer than other of its size. Move your penguin along a path, take the tile that path began with, get those points for the end of the game. As the tiles get snatched up, the "board" becomes tighter, and you have to think to keep yourself from getting cut off from major points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A cracking game for players across the entire spectrum, from children and families to gamers with an appetite for superb fillers, with the side note that it only is fun if all players are of similar capability. But when they are, it can be a brilliant exercise in optimal positioning and blocking on a rapidly shrinking bit of ice.

And I'm a sucker for flippers, it's hideously cute. The 2(?) rules take less time to explain that it takes to read this sentence, but what you are faced with is one clever hexagonal puzzle-in-reverse, in which scoring tiles are removed one-by-one. It screams out for a bigger board and special tiles, but what you get instead is probably just right. Dead-simple, dead-fast, and dead-addictive.

It is true that if one player lets something slip on their turn, someone else is likely to profit disproportionately, often giving them an advantage that can be impossible to counter. Especially in the middle game, when the ice chucks that a single player can pick unchallenged are starting to emerge. And even though not decisive, like in Settlers, well-chosen starting locations will make your food fight that much easier.

In a 4 player game you do rely on other players making the most of their options, to keep everyone working equally hard for their fish. Being the last player with 4 could also mean that all your viable options have been ripped away from the 2 penguins you have on the ice. It is often someone's weakest move that decides who the winner is, regardless. I like it better as 2 and 3 player game, as that is far less of a factor. With 2 it can be a great clash of minds. With 3 it has some sweet unpredictability. On ice that only seems appropriate.

It reminded me of Fossil on ice, but with hexagonal movement, and that is so much more interesting. Scoring is brought back to a bare minimum, and for once, stripping off complex layers and going for a the bare essentials turns this Arctic land grab into one hot experience. Recommended.

SimpleAbstract, MultiOnly

I own the first, entirely wooden edition, called Pingvinas.  The penguin pawns in the new version look much better, but you can't beat the tiles of the old version.

The game is a very short abstract based on breaking up the board and isolating your opponents in disadvantaged positions (e.g., where they can only rake up measly amounts of fish).  It's fast, tactical, and involves penguins; what else is needed?  :)

I got the second edition in trade.  The tiles aren't wood, but they are much more practical.

Good filler. Easy to learn. Difficult to master.

My latest strategy revolves around trying to move my penguins into spaces near center-placed opponent penguins in order to block them from the outlying large fields of fish. In doing so, this puts a field of fish between me and the edge of the board and it puts me between the opponent and the field of fish. So opponent in the center, then me, then field of fish, then game's edge. This strategy does not yet account for non-center placed opponents or edge dwelling oppponents. My guess would be to still apply the largest field strategy only without the limiter of the game's edge, perhaps another opponents  piece, or my own. Hmmm.

I bought this almost solely for the name; imagine my surprise to find out it was actually good as well!  Games play pretty quickly; takes about 3 minutes to set up and ten minutes to play.  Strategically rich for such a simple game; really makes you think, but doesn't burn your brain out since the games play so quickly anyway.  A fun game to randomly break out and mix things up with.

After more plays, it's hard to get excited about busting it out.  It has some interesting mathematics, bit it takes so long to set up in relation to how long it takes to play.

A deceptively great game.  Easy to learn but contains strategy to satisfy gamers.  My kids have devised a couple of variants for Hey! That's My Fish!.
#1 - Floating - If your penguin becomes isolated, you can spend one turn to float him back to the nearest section of the board.  He may move normally on the next turn.
#2 - Fish Hunter - Start by setting up the board with the tiles upside down.  Play as usual.  It is a surprise to find out what your tile holds.
#3 - Holes - turn some of the tiles upside down in a regular game to create holes in the ice. Your penguins can jump in one hole to emerge through another on another part of the board. 
#4 - Bump! - Another version of this lets you spend your turn to bump another penguin into a hole thereby costing him a turn to get out.  Beware!
I hope these help make an already fun game even more fun.

The FF edition doesn`t have good components. Even though it is easy to carry around, that doesn`t matter much for me, only in case of vacation/pinic games, which are not my thing so much. Game is everything it could be. My grade is mostly because of the FF edition. Takes a lot of effort to set up compared to how quick it is played.

6 plays:

Intriguing combination of simplicity and depth. Sometimes I think this should be a game played as often in 2nd grade as Checkers and Chess. In a way, it's a perfect game to exercise chess-like strategy and tactics, with less depth and complexity than chess. 

The theme isn't as big a draw with kids as I'd think. 

Gets asked for moderately often.

Traded to a friend.  While I enjoyed this game as a quick little filler with some strategy the setup time just makes it a more of a pain as a filler.  Filler games where the setup takes as long as it does to play just can't compete against some of the quick and strong fillers out there now.

I wanted to like this much more than I actually did.  The concept sounded great, and it seemed like there would be lots of strategy.  But it wound up being too short to really enjoy - it was over so fast that I didn't have time to care whether I was winning or losing, let alone really develop a strategy.

RATING: 6.5
Cambiado a Waltien en la BSK por un Warhammer invasión (junto a un Atlanteon y un Hive), en Octubre de 2010

Juego hipersencillo. Cada jugador parte con una serie de pinguinos que se mueven sobre unas losetas hexagonales, siempre en linea recta, y no pudiendo saltar huecos vacíos ni a otros pinguinos. Cuando un pinguino se mueve, el jugador se queda la loseta de la que partió su movimiento. Las losetas contienen 1, 2 o 3 peces. La partida finaliza cuando nadie se puede seguir moviendo. El que más peces haya pescado, gana. 

Se explica en un minuto y se juega en 10 o 15. Se tarda casi más en montar el tablero. Es un juego indicado para no jugones, o para rellenar huecos en sesiones jugonas. Tiene un toquecito de estrategia, pero sin complicaciones.

Fun game with a bit of area control in it. You need to block the other players from reaching all the nice tiles with 2 or 3 fish on.

Extremely easy to learn, but exremely hard to master. There are to ways to play this game: 1-thinking A LOT about every move you make, always trying to maximize bth yo current and future score, and 2-quickly and aggressively attacking both the fish and you opponents. I tend to find the latter a lot more interesting, since dragging the game out for ages spoils the experience. Need I say that I hate chess.

I love this little game for some of the same reasons that I like GO. Now I don't know if I will ever play GO again. A bit unforgiving and mean, but super fast and easy to catch on to, and the kind of game that makes non-gamers say "this is a good game!" after like two moves. I'm sure it will see plenty of play.

EDIT: After a solid number of plays, but after only a few months of owning this, I've traded it away. There just isn't a ton of variation to the strategy to keep me coming back for more. Though I do really enjoy it, my plays were already getting quite samey. Wanted to keep it to laugh at the art, but inevitably let it go. Fare well! A candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long.

Phalanx' many travails left me completely unprepared for this wonderful little gem of a game. Fast-playing, simple, fun, and interesting, this is a great opener and or closer and is surprisingly thoughtful for a little game. The theme is wonderful, and the Phalanx production is great. When it comes to light games, give me something simple, clever, and artful like this over the more pondorous Ticket to Ride (the game we played before H!TMF!) any day.

This was a surprise winner, and I'm sorry I missed playing it last year when it came out in English, because it would have comfortably made my "best of 2005" list.

UPDATE: The replaybility of this hasn't been quite what I hoped. After about 20 games, it's lost its edge for me. But still, 20 games for a game at this level is excellent.

Great game for abstract/strategic thinkers. Surprised to see this recommended for kids so often though, it seems to me that this is completely skill-based and requires a good portion of strategic/spatial thinking. While my strategic/logical son likes and excels at it, my tactical/imaginative daughter doesn't like it at all, penguins or not. 

And the time it takes to set up, although not more than a couple of minutes at most, is somehow a little off-putting to us. Or perhaps it is the fiddliness rather than the set-up time that means that this isn't brought to the table so often in our house.

It's mean, which I like. But sometimes cutting people off helps them get more points. Not sure about it's merits yet. It's length helps it. I've never found set up to be a bear if everyone helps.

RATING: 6
It's clever, quick, and quite interactive. On your turn you will want to move all of your penguins, but you can't. So it's certainly got tension as well.

To note, the game is vicious. It is not about collecting fishes, it is about cornering the other penguins so that that they can't get any.

A design feature I really appreciate is that, compared to a game like Amazons (a very similar game), the beginning is more interesting. At the beginning of Amazons, there is no real reason to do anything. You make moves because it is your turn, the game is far too opaque at that stage to evaluate what is a good move and what isn't (at higher levels this may not be true, but at my level it is and it turns me off enough such that I won't be getting any better). However, in HTMF, you know what a good move early on is, it's a move that gets you three points as opposed to one or two. Now, eventually the game is about claiming area for yourself, and it's important to know when to transition, but early on the moves are not opaque because there is a secondary objective, get short term points.

The games biggest flaw is likely that the set-up time is equal to the play time. However, if played on a tablet, the game is awesome and would be rated much higher.

Unfortunately for HTMF, Battle Sheep has a very similar feel in play, but is much faster to setup.

This is really a perfect little abstract. It's not the brain burner many classic abstracts are (Your Gos, Your Chesses, Your Hives) but the level of strategy in this game is absolutely perfect for its short length. More importantly, though, the fact that its strategy is entirely centered around fierce player interaction just raises the fun factor above and beyond most abstracts for me. Lots of abstracts are competitive, but an abstract that plays well with 2-4 and is this cutthroat is a thing or rarity and beauty indeed. Blokus comes close, but there the mean plays come mostly in the endgame... whereas Hey, That's My Fish starts with is all teeth and claws (beaks and flippers?) from the very start, because there isn't time to fuck around.

Plus, adorable penguins! MEAN adorable penguins! THAT'S THE BEST KIND, YOU GUYS. Honestly I feel like the game's length + adorable factor wins over even my least-competitive friends. There's something that's just funny about the cute vs. evil dichotomy.

Update: This is the abstract that's gotten the most consistent play for me, so after many years with the original Mayfair version, I've upgraded to the FFG small box edition via a trade. Love it! Easy to transport, better & clearer art on the tiles, and the penguin minis are much cuter.

Previously owned the deluxe edition, but I sold it and bought the new tiny edition because of storage issues. It's precisely the same (somewhat lacking) game, so I'm glad it now only takes up less than half of the room it did before. It can be played nicely or cutthroat if you want and you need to make sure you don't get blocked! An okay game which can be played on two different "levels".

Love that the theme hides what a vicious little game this is.

I am really struggling with developing an on-going strategy. I'm not terrible, but I am so not getting better at this game. Things just start to break for a player and it takes off. But I kind of enjoy that I can't figure out the game---I respect it more for that!

Charming game. Not a fan of the deluxe version. The original is best. Especially for what the game is: a charming and deceptively evil little game that plays very quickly.

EDIT:  My daughters are now 17 and 15, and I reacquired a new copy a few years ago (cheap, cheap discount) in the hopes that maybe we could play again.  It has sat unplayed, and we may never get that chance.  But I will keep it just in case.

Hey! That's My Fish is one of the most deceptively ruthless games. On appearance, you have what appears to be a children's game with cute penguins and hex tiles of fish. And, the rules can be explained in about a minute, with a game lasting about 5 to 10 minutes.

Sounds silly and light? Just wait until you start moving your penguin pieces in this no-luck, chess-like, abstract game. Each player quickly begins to cut off one another, marginalizing each player and trying to capture the best areas. It is delightfully cutthroat, and I forget how good of a filler this really is. It's one of the best options for 5 minutes of gaming. 

For the record, I'm a fan of the deluxe edition plastic penguins.

Great game that is incredibly simple to learn and teach with a fun and accesible, if pasted on, theme.

I bought this to play with my six year old.  On the plus side, he enjoys the bits, the theme, and the gameplay.  He completely understands the rules and the basics of strategy.  Obviously, the more sophisticated strategies still elude him (cutting off your opponent) but its still fun to play a non-luck driven game with my son.On the minus side I would never choose to play this game against an adult.  My taste in gaming is not for abstracts or games with meaningless themes.  I like my games to portray something interesting, be it historical, fantasy, or sci fi.

RATING: 10
Pretty close to a perfect game. Kids love it for the theme and simplicity, but there is lots of room for strategy. A 2-player game between adults feels like a good game of chess. 

It's a perfect information game, which basically means that there are no hidden cards in your hand or the deck or any die rolls or anything random at all. Every bit of information you need to win the game is sitting right in front of you, and it's up to you to mess it up or not. 

My only complaint is how long it takes to set up versus how long it takes to play, and the fact that I constantly bump the other ice pieces out of place when I pick up the one my penguin is on. 

My wife described it as if a game of checkers decided to grow up and become a real game, but got taught by Phase 10. When played with adults, you end up loving the game and hating the players. 

At the 10-15$ price point, no one has any excuse not to own a copy.

RATING: 8.5
An AP-heavy game if you want to play optimally, but not doing so still makes the game super fun. This isn't a 'you always have 1 right decision' kind of game. You can use different strategies and still do well. It's super fun, super light, yet super heavy at the same time.

The mechanics here work better than any similar kind of game I've played. I have the tiny version of the game (the newest edition iirc). It works well at this size. If it were too big, it'd lose some of its value. It's a small and simple game, so having small tiles works perfect.

Set up is also quick. Just have all players help out and don't worry about optimizing the board layout - placing the penguins at the start is like Settlers - it's a self-balancing mechanism for the random board.

This is a great little portable game. I bought this to take tramping (hiking), and it was perfect for that situation. It is small and very portable, with two players is a quick strategic game that we enjoyed plenty. It was also really cheap ($18 NZ), which was a bonus - I have seen plenty of small games that cost much more than this. 

It is essentially an abstract but the theme attracts me to it and makes it much more whimsical than if it were just generic pieces, so I would say the theme makes sense to the game play.

I would rate it higher if I had played it more, so perhaps once I do I will revisit my rating - and I will play it more because I will keep taking it tramping (hiking) with us.

This is an excellent game to start teaching the difference between short-term gains vs. long term goals. 

My tiny tably toppers love how they can say the phrase in so many different ways, to mean different things!

- Anger when someone beats them to a particular tile: [b]HEY!!![/b] That's my fish!
- Gloating when they got a key tile: Hey! That's [b]MYYYYYY[/b] fish!
- Confirmation that they just blocked you out of a huge section of ice: Hey! That's my [b]FIIISSSSHHHHH![/b]

If you can get the delux version - every kid loves penguin figurines. If you get the smaller version, go get one of those plastic toy guns that shoots "plunger stick bullets" (or whatever they are called). Then you can use the plunger to retrieve tiles that are hard to pick out from the middle.

Cute but cut throat game.  I love it with three.  Who are you gonna block out of their fish stash?  The game is about moving yourself into isolated fishing holes rather than focusing on high value fish pieces.  The most agonizing phase of the game (and some would argue the whole game) is placing the penguins with this end game in mind.  It becomes a game of reacting to your opponent before anybody has even claimed their first tile.  Set up, however is fiddly.

RATING: 6
Extremely cute abstract game, but the theme veneer is charming and adds something to it for me. The game is basically all about positioning oneself and trying to isolate sections of the board if possible. The movement scheme feels something like Yinsh and Zertz combined, as you remove pieces from the board like Zertz, but have the movement range of Yinsh, and like that game the board piece that is effected is the one that you started the turn on.

I like the fact that the game seems to have plenty of range for good tactical play, but is still very quick to explain and very quick to play. Quite enjoyable, though its lightness and lack of depth mean that I wouldn't want to play it too often, because I imagine it would be an easy title to burn out on.

The whole family likes it! I can play with anyone, any time.  What a rare combination.

Wow. Talk about dirt simple rules. But it feels elegant. Not sure how long it will last, but it feels a bit Go-like. The penguin movemt is ridiculously simple. Nice ratio between strategy and rules complexity. This *looks* like a light game, but it's a perfect information game with no luck, and plays like an abstract, despite the cute pictures. Very good.

Short tactical game which gets more trickier as the playing field begins to resemble a swiss cheese more and more&mdash;but by then your pinguins may be in the wrong place to do much about it. There is also a distinctive point where you know the game is at an end even though a third of the tiles is still available. The end result is something I'm in two minds about: some interesting   strategies, but without a high replayability. A '5' should do it justice.

I'm liking this one less than I did initially.  

The game begins with the climax; the first few moves often decide the winner, and the bulk of the game is essentially an extended epilogue.  Usually, you can stop playing several moves in advance, and determine the winner by simply tallying the remaining tiles.  

That's not such a bad thing.  In many ways, this forced, razor-edged decisiveness is preferable to a game that drags.  The whole experience is fast, exciting and painless.   I guess I just want a little more "epic-ness" in my abstracts.  This is more like a barroom brawl than a clash of powerful armies.  It's an interesting game, and I'll continue to play it, but my first impressions haven't quite held up, which is disappointing.

This is a simple little game that I can actually play with my two-year-old son.  There's some strategy involved, sure, but it's fun for him to simply move his penguins around and collect fish.

RATING: 7.5
Quite nice and light pseudo thematic abstract game. All you have to do is move your penguin and take the tile which you just left. Usually there is not much to think about in your turn (move, next player, move again and so on) but occasional it can burn your brain cells. Better than Coloretto but not good as 6nimmt! All three are good titles to choose if you want pleasant start to your gaming event.

Great light game. Theme and simplicity make it very accessible; yet it's still strategic for those who want to think. Limited scope means it's quick to play, but freeform board means replayability is high. Also reasonably portable if you dump components in a bag rather than using the box. Excellent for what it is; I'd rate it higher, but tend to prefer slightly heavier games.

Components: Funky wooden penguins. Thick, attractive, functional tiles that are easy enough to handle. The box could be half as large.

Experience: The allure of the 3-fish tiles helps give the opening game some direction. As the penguins edge around each other, Go-style, the board's vulnerabilities begin to develop. Soon it's a tactical game of sectioning off chunks of tiles, with each player trying to ensure that their penguins will have uncontested access to fish when the endgame begins. Quick playing.

Other than the theme, this game could live happily among the GIPF series, as there are some pleasant similarities to TAMSK.

I've played enough now that I'm no longer itching to play, but each game is still absorbing.

Enjoyable area capture game with cute penguins. Plays well with 2/3/4 players and young children. Setup is tedious but short. I think people complain about it because the game time is short as well and the board is taken apart while playing, meaning it has to be set up all over again for a second game. This is not an issue for me.

No luck, perfect information abstract game with cute penguins.  It's positional, as you try to isolate your penguins on large islands of ice while keeping your opponents from doing the same, or at least keeping their islands as small as you can.

I love the rules - very elegant.

Simple and easily explained within a couple of minutes but with loads of emergent tactics and strategies to employ.

As a 2P game, it's actually a deep abstract game but I imagine it as a fun, chaotic 3/4p.

2009-07-29 8>7.7

With 4p, it still feels fairly ordered - maybe because of the fewer number of penguins per folk, retaining some semblance of sanity in the game.

I feel that with multiple folk, it definitely becomes less strategic (as I expected) but rather than simply being chaotic and on the verge of 'too complicated to plan', it becomes beneficial to be competing with a weaker player (Finn giving John a large island she should have won).

I definitely enjoyed both the games, but it wasn't the riotous affair I expected. With the limited movement and power to only compete with those close to you, relative player strength of those you're competing with matters a lot.

Great game for both kids and adults.  Lots of cutthroat moves to screw your opponents over.  

Only downside is the relatively long setup time (actually only about 5 minutes but seems longer) for a small/quick game.

Plays really well as a two player game. Compact. "Coffee shop game".

Top drawer light-filler. What is great about this game, is that it works equally well when played lightly (could be played by 5 year old kids), or played seriously (could be played like a simplified version of Go). Very rare that any game has that sort of range.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very simple.  Kids love it.  I don't find myself wanting to play it a lot but I do every time the kids want to play it.  The kids (around 8 years of age) rate it 9.

From the looks of it, the manufacturer did not put to much work into the game.  For example, rules state: Put tiles face down and shuffle.  Then turn face up and align them.  ?? The same thing is on both sides of the tiles.  What's the point is putting them face down?

I love the simplicity of this game, and how amazingly fun it is. I'm planning on painting up my minis to match different species... Little Blue, Emperor and Gentoo penguins for sure, and trying to decide between Galapagos and African penguins for the last player's pieces. I just hope they come out awesome. ^_^

To update my review, I have painted the playing pieces that come with the game, and I'm quite pleased with how they came out. I went with the Galapagos for the fourth species of penguin, and now they're my favorites. I need to take pictures, so I can share them.

RATING: 6
Reminds me of Ingenious which I really like, and it is themed (which I tend to not like abstracts). But the gameplay didn't do much for me. More of an area control game and your ability to win is largely determined by your opponents moves.

What I liked:
* Theme
* Not just getting the most fish, you have to look at future turns

What I didn't like:
* nothing seemed new or excitingly different.

Probably time to get the kids (6-7yo) into this.

Edit: still popular with the kids, now 9&10yo.  Coming up with their own rules: "guard penguins", that you have to "defeat" (with a die roll...!) before you can pass them by.  Setting up the hexes as paths underground, and the penguins are dwarven miners (?!) going through tunnels.  Marvellous fun :-)

Hey, That's My Fish! is, just like Plants vs Zombies, an example of unspeakable evil and horror receiving a cute face.  Oh, on the surface the game is just about happy go lucky penguins snacking on fish, but the reality is that entire penguin families will starve to death or die of loneliness on an isolated ice floe.  The horror...the...horror...  The game is really fast; scales well between 2 and 4 players; there are lots of difficult decisions to make, but the set up time is annoying.  I always want to play, but I do not always feel like setting up the game.

RATING: 6
Players navigate their penguins over an 8 x 8 hexagonal tile game board.  As the penguin leaves a tile, it claims that tile as part of it's end of game score.  Penguins can't turn, jump over gaps or other penguins, thus get more and more restricted by the ever shrinking play area.  When all penguins are locked out, score the value of the tiles claimed (one to three fish each).  Highest wins.  Good game - seems to take longer to set up than play!

I mean this is a really simple game. The setup takes a bit of time since all of the tokens have to be flipped upside down. My wife and I played a few times... probably will just sit on the shelf until a garage sale

RATING: 7
Cute little abstract, plays quickly.  Suffers somewhat more than others from beat-on-the-leader syndrome, so it may be best as a two-player or four-player-partnership game.  Picking up hex tiles from the middle of a set-up is a bit awkward; might be worth investing in a suction-cup thingie from Kadon.

Hey, That's My Fish is typically thought of as a simple filler game, but there's actually quite a bit more going on than meets the eye. Aside from the random setup, the game functions as a no-luck area-enclosure game. Much more accessible and somewhat simpler than Amazons, the game is equal in play. The differing values on the fish tiles offer new players clear goals and create slightly different games each time.

Much hay has been made of the setup time. Honestly, I'm not sure that it's something you need to worry about. Yes, it takes a little while, but no more than a minute or two, and playing the game will take a good bit longer than that.

The game scales fairly well. Multiplayer abstracts aren't my favorite, but this one works well, avoiding excessive chaos while retaining interaction. There's an implicit lesson about fighting a two-front war that can be learned when attempting to save two penguins from threats from different opponents simultaneously. Recommended for a fan of abstracts, multiplayer or otherwise.

I was first introduced to this game via iOS on iPad. Fell in love with it and bought the FFG version of this game. The tiles are too small and very fiddly during setup and gameplay. Due to the small tile size, they're prone to dislocate when someone wants to pick/remove a tile.

This game is PURE EVIL! I was expecting a light kids' game. While this game could indeed be easily taught to children, there is actually a savage game of punch and counter-punch here. Collecting fish is secondary to screwing your opponents by leaving them stranded on ice flows, or strategically isolating yourself on large ice-flows with lots of fish. I like it. I especially like the fact that you can play a whole game in about 20 minutes. The components are nice. I suppose if I had one very minor gripe it's that setup can be a bit tedious, but that's a very minor point. The child friendly appearance makes me think of Reiner Knizia's Through The Desert. That game, like Hey! That's My Fish!, has colorful and kid friendly components, but it is actually a brutal and highly competitive game.

Try flipping over a bunch of the tiles when playing with kids/non-gamers. Handicapping through starting with different numbers of penguins is also possible.
 
One set up I liked was playing on a mini board with one penguin each and all the iceberg tiles but a few 2 fish tiles upside down.  Players place their penguin on a 2 fish tile to start the game.

There are lots of options. :)

Don't let the cute penguin minis and short play time fool ya, this is a fairly cut-throat game.  It is quite family friendly as the rules are super simple to learn, but there are enough tactics involved to give it some meat.  The only small complaint is the slightly long setup (especially when compared to the play time), but it does not detract from the fun!

2015-01-13 : When playing it for the first time I went through 3 phases :
1) uh, this looks pretty straight-forward - are you sure this is a game ?
2) wait a sec - if I do this, then they can do that and I get stuck
3) need to play this again, because I can see the mistakes I made - there's more to this game than first meets the eye

RATING: 7.75
Very simple to play, but with great strategy and some nailbiting, especially with more players. If I had a complaint, it's that the cost is pretty steep for the type of play you get, mostly due to the 16 large, hand-painted penguins.

UPDATE: I don’t play this one as much as I’d like but it’s a good one. A deceptively confrontational game.

UPDATE: I always enjoy pointing the box out on my game shelf and saying "Hey, that's my 'Hey That's My Fish'!" I love doing that.

I loved this game when we first tried it in its original "Pingvinas" incarnation. I wish I could have gotten a copy of that with its nice chunky wooden tiles, but I was overjoyed when I head that Mayfair was redoing it. I hate the name though.

This is a decent little abstract strategy game.  The rules are so simple my friends 4 year old daughter was able to play.  The game is still good enough that adults can enjoy this.  My only problem with this game is that I personally feel setting up the tiles takes longer than it should based on how long the actual game takes to play.

It might be difficult to invent a game with less rules - did each designer contribute one only? But astonishingly enough this is a winner - not in the "world-shaking-over-the-top-great" category - but in the equally difficult "abstract-strategy-game-that- doesn't-bore-you-to-pieces-while-the- other-player-takes-5 hours-to-do-his- move"-discipline. Essentially a game of the "survive-to-be-able-to-garner-points" family, but this should end this review of the "long-made-up-names-for-game-categories" sort...

RATING: 3
Looks like a fun, family style, puzzle game, and to a certain extent it is. However, the entire game comes down to penguin placement. Once players get a knack for the game it becomes fairly easy to determine which players have the best (or worst) chances of victory, but players don't have enough options to effectively turn to the tide.

Very nice little game. Quick to explain, and play. The game is really an abstract game wrapped like a game for children. I especially like the earliest part of the game where the penguins are trying to move into position to get a lot of fish and at the same time to cut other penguins off.

Played it both with kids and gamers and everyone seems to love it.

[b][thread=476527]The PLAYMOBIL® Legion reviews "Hey! That's My Fish![/thread][/b]

(As of [b]9[/b] plays) A family-friendly game about penguins who mysteriously can't swim. The rules are extremely simple, but there is enough potential for strategic maneuvering to keep more experienced gamers interested. Set-up is a bit fiddly, but it plays fast (although can cause Analysis Paralysis in some - you know who you are, Eric) and seems to scale well from 2-4 players.

[b]2 year verdict:[/b] Still a fun game. Wouldn't mind playing more often (although with 2 players I would still prefer [GAMEID=2655].)

RATING: 6
For looking like a children’s game, Hey! That’s My Fish! is surprisingly cutthroat. New players will often spend their first few games making a beeline for the 3-fish tiles until they realize that the person who wins is the one who manages to isolate other penguins as soon as possible. Then the game becomes much more aggressive and tactical.

Hey! That’s My Fish! is certainly enjoyable to play. But there’s something about spatially-based games that doesn’t quite do it for me. I never get the sensation of digging my teeth into this game and chewing on it. If you can plan several moves ahead,  you should be able to set yourself up for a pretty good position in the endgame. 

And the endgame is where Hey! That’s My Fish stumbles a bit. Because you remove ice flows as your penguins move away from them, the game board gets smaller very quickly, thereby limiting your options and making it easier to see which move is best. The final few turns of the game consist of just moving your penguin around on its own isolated group of ice flows until you run out of room. The first three or four moves are the most critical; everything after that is merely a continuation of your original tactics. 

It’s a shame Hey! That’s My Fish! kind of sputters to a halt, because if the designers could have kept that same level of initial tension throughout, I would rank this as one of my favorite abstract games (along with Yinsh). But the ending is unfortunately anticlimactic. I’ll still happily play this game on occasion, but it doesn’t quite scratch my brain-burner itch.

We played this game for the first time over vacation and just loved it. We played with two friends who are not gamers and they both loved it too. We gave the game to them so they could take it home to their kids. This game should appeal to both adults and children over seven, maybe even younger. If playing younger kids, you could give them an advantage by make the 3 fish tiles available only for them. -- We played again recently, four games in a short session, and the two new players loved it too. I have bought two copies so far, and given both away, so now I need to buy a third.

My girlfriend and I can play a game in about 5 minutes. That's not counting the 10 minutes of setting up tiles and placing penguins.

We really enjoy this little filler game.

The penguin figures are awesome and I love the cheeky smirk one of them has however game play is very abstracted.

You may move only a single of the two penguins that you play with and the tile you started on is removed from the game and scores you points which means the game board shrinks and eventually you run out of moves.

Gameplay is repetitive and rather tedious.

A pure strategy game that's great for children and adults.  The rules are simple - but it's smart, charming, and plays quickly.

It takes just as long to set up as it does to play.  Grade: B

The top game among cute cartoonish animals who sit beguilingly in the corner until, approached by unsuspecting strangers, eat people in one swift, silent cartoonish chomp. Also popular among people who like knife fights.

I've seen it compared to Battle Sheep, which I haven't yet tried, but it's true that Hey...! has a fiddly setup. The travel version is highly portable and it's a solid abstract that's deceptively cute. But it hasn't come out for a long time and I'm curious to see if Battle Sheep doesn't capture my kids' fancy better.

Enjoyable Game and good with kids. For 3-y-old it was just about moving the penguins, but as 4-y-old the basic premise of collecting fish is understood.  Only disadvantage is the set up of the tiles at the start which is slow for such a quick game to play.

1 play. 2p x 1.

1st play: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:. NOV14. This game didn't blow me away, but the small box and tactical play, combined with a low price point, is attractive. The tension is scoring and keeping movement options open, and denying those same opportunities to your opponent as the board shrinks. Neat!

RATING: 5.5
With 2 players, it's still an OK game, but it kind of feels like Chess then, the better player able to outthink his opponent most of the times. If after 5 plays the score is 4-1 or even 5-0, the other player wants to quit. Who can blame him/her ?

With 4 players, it becomes too much of a luckfest, as by the time it's your turn again, a lot of chaos has happened and you might be completely locked in.

So my feeling is this plays best with 3, as then some tactical skill is rewarded, but you still need a bit of luck as well. Only downfall is that you don't stand a chance at all if the others are playing against you. So if after a couple of games they sense you are the smartest, they will form a pact against you and you can forget about it. Hence my rather poor rating for this game. I like to compare it a bit to Tamega (coincidentally from the same year ?), but I prefer the latter, certainly with 2 players.

I also can't help but feel that this game is also missing something. More tiles and/or some special ones could do the trick.

RATING: 3
[Abstract Strategy] (Packeis am Pol) [2P:3, 3P:3] A simple idea that wasn't taken far enough as a game. Players plunk penguins down on a hex grid made of individual tiles. The players then move them around in straight lines. When a penguin leaves the tile it's standing on, the penguin's owner claims the tile. Shades of an even simpler, less random version of Verflixxt. Too short, and has all the depth of a children's wading pool, which is appropriate I guess since that probably is the extent of the target audience for the game. PS: If you like where the game was going, but are frustrated that it ended six stops short of its destination, check out Kris Burm's YINSH. It's got similar ideas but is executed differently, plus it takes the ball all the way into the end zone, complete with celebration. ***UPDATE: Still completely unremarkable, and has a tendency to be anticlimactic. I really don't understand the appeal beyond the fascination of some gamers with the penguin-shaped bits. Might be ok as a children's game. Think training wheels until the kid can graduate to YINSH.

It's a great multi-player abstract strategy game, simple to explain, very cute looking, but still very challenging. Still, I just don't do well in/enjoy abstracts, thus the low rating.

Lots of fun for all ages, though setup can be a bit boring and removing tiles can knock adjacent ones out of alignment. Try to counter this by leaving gaps between tiles and young ones find it harder to see the straight diagonal lines across which they can move. A board that held the tiles in place would be lovely

For a light quick filler with a good dose of strategy, rating this an eight is high (I'm not sure I'd rate any game this short any higher).  Very accessible but unique - great for gamers, kids, and non-gamers alike.  It has extremely simple rules, but it's fun to watch people catch on to the elegance of how the rules play out in the course of the game.

RATING: 8
Don't let this game fool you into thinking it's a kids game! It's a GREAT game for any age! Sure, your average 4 or 5yo can understand what they are doing, but the strategy is a bit deeper. When I really love it is when the kids leave the table and the gloves can come off.  About halfway through his first game (5 minutes?!), my 25yo nephew says, "Wow, this is vicious!".  And he's used to playing PR, so he's no newbie.

H!TMF has two of the three strategic elements of chess: timing and position.  The one that is missing is material; all pieces in this game have the same power. As a result, it is lighter, quicker, and more accessible.

Fun to play, but game doesn't last long enough IMHO.  Wish the playing field (aka the ice field) were larger.  At least the penguin figures are fun to look at and use in the game.  They kind of remind me of the penguin characters in the cartoon "3-2-1 Penguins".  Changed my mind.  Giving it away to Goodwill.

OK, 7 seconds after the box was opened, we were up and playing.  And we loved it!  Simple, great bits, semi-strategic, plenty of opportunity to screw other people over...  A beautiful, beautiful game.

Beware when playing with 4: one person can fairly easily be ganged up on and eliminated.  Don't care, this game is still super fun.  And it's got penguins!  Penguins.  What's not to love?

A very solid, strategic abstract game for all ages. I really enjoy playing this to pass the time, or between other games.

The only drawback I can find to this game is that the hexes tend to slide apart if you are grabbing some of the center ones. However, this isn't a major issue and can easily be worked around.

Don't let these cute penguins fool you. They are jerks.

Hey, that's my "it's a pain in the ass to set this up with all these Q!#$@# tiles considering how quickly this plays."

The FFG version is a feat of modern engineering in how they fit what was a Mayfair-sized game into a tiny little box.  The small tiles are kind of a bitch to handle though and makes the (relatively) lengthy set-up even worse.

Understand when I say "Relatively", I'm talking about in relation to the actual depth and length of gameplay.  It takes me ten minutes to set up War of the Ring; we'll play for three hours.  This takes me five minutes to set up; we'll play in about five minutes.  Grrrrrr.

Otherwise, a decent, but theme-light family abstract game that's okay, but it isn't going to blow my skirt up.  Cute artwork will make it appealing for kids.

I love this game! A few people I've taught don't understand what sort of game it is until they find themselves isolated while I'm getting buckets of fish. Then they say "oh, it's THAT sort of game" and we have a rematch and it's brutal. Very good!

However once players do know what they're doing it becomes a game of hitting the perceived leader. As you can't really tell who the leader is, it's a political game, and that's not something that interests me.

A no luck brain burning filler.  It suffers a little bit for the setup, seeing that it sometimes takes as long as the play, but other than that Hey That's My Fish is a wonderful little abstract strategy game.  The gameplay is quick, simple, and clever. It has a lot of wish I could do more, and a fair share of screw your opponent moments.  This is a game I see ending and starting evenings with for a while to come.

UPDATE:  The more I play this, the more I enjoy it.  Although the mechanics have that feeling of something old and familiar, for some reason this penguin panic plays fresh.  I believe this one has longevity after now having played a few more times. 

UPDATE: The set up in this one hurts the game.  still enjoy it, just find it cumbersome to set all the tiles up for such short game time.

Førstehåndsindtrykket for de fleste er sikker: Sikke et nuttet lille spil! Men er der noget Hey, That's My Fish! ikke er, så er det nuttet! Det er et benhårdt spil om overlevelse på isflagerne. For hvert træk bliver området man kæmper på mindre og et øjebliks uopmærksomhed kan betyder, at du er fanget på en isflage og isoleret fra den videre kamp om at samle flere af de eftertragtede fisk op, der er spillets point. Det største problem med spillet er i mine øjne, at opsætningen af spillepladen oftest tager stort set lige så lang tid som selve spillet. Når selve spillet kan spilles på omkring 10 minutter gør det ikke så meget, men det trækker alligevel ned i den samlede vurdering. Spillet skalerer fint, men spiloplevelsen med de forskellige spillerantal er dog meget forskellig - jo flere spillere desto mere kaotisk. Ved to spillere er det til gengæld meget analytisk.

A fun game that can be picked up by anyone. It looks like a kids game but it's fun abstract strategy game to play. 
Players place their penguins in hexs and move around trying to collect fish, hexs have from 1 to 3 fish each, every time someone leaves an hex it will sink it and may cut paths to other hexs, if you're penguin is cut-off and doesn't have where to go it will also sink. At the end the player with most fish wins.

RATING: 8
Similar to yinsh in that you can move a piece along a straight line as far as you want, as long as there are no other pieces blocking that path.
Similar to zertz in that the play area shrinks with every move made.
Similar to go, through the desert etc in that you get points for enclosing areas

Move your piece one or more steps along a straight line, holes or other pieces block your path. Take the tile that you started your move from. This tile will give you victory points at the end of the game.
The gameboard will quickly break up into smaller clusters, and you must position your pieces to get the best clusters for yourself. This often involves denying your opponents any good moves by blocking their pieces.
Some tiles have a larger point value, but in many cases it is better to get a big area of low scoring tiles for yourself than to fight over a few high scoring tiles.

The initial placement of pieces and the random board prevents standard openings and scripted play which makes the game feel relatively fresh every time.

Very easy rules make it possible to play with just about anyone. It takes no time at all to go through the rules, and the game is over in about 15 minutes which means many people will agree to at least try it once. 
This is an abstract strategy game, and the gateway suitability of this depends mostly on if you think your players find such games fun or not. But on the other hand, I have noticed that the cute(?) penguins makes the game a little bit less intimidating and some players are more willing to play this than other abstracts like zertz for example. 

I've seen many people complain about the ratio of setup time and play time. At 10-15 minutes play time, and 2-3 minutes setup time, it definitely is noticeable but I'm not bothered by it.

I like the 2 player version best since you have more control. The rating drops a point per extra player. The four player game, although more chaotic, is still fun, but mostly because it is such a quick game.

Hey! That's My Fish is a thinky abstract game wrapped in a fun, family-friendly theme. The components (in the deluxe edition) are oustanding, comprising sturdy cardboard hexes and cute cartoonish penguin figures in four humorous postures. Setup takes a few minutes. The rules are simple and easy to remember. As a short, light-weight game, it is perfect for a prelude or postlude to longer, heavier games or can be played several times in succession.

In a two-player game, the competition can seem aggressive because a winning strategy often involves isolating and stranding opponent pieces. No luck is involved; therefore, if the two players are not evenly matched, the weaker player is unlikely to win. Turns can take some time while a thoughtful player decides how to optimize a move, but the other player can usually spend that time planning the next move.

This game might be appropriate for players with low vision. Color-blind players could play if the penguins are given distinguishing marks.

This is an amazing game.  It ranks up there with classics like checkers for games with very basic rules that have an amazing level of strategy in them.

Horrible name, terrific game.  Reminds me of the Cwali game Floriado crossed with a GIPF series game.  It looks like a kid's game or a lightweight filler, and while it can be played as either of those, it can also be played as more of a thinker's game.  Although it's just a reissue of Günter Cornett's homemade Pingvinas, I consider this to be Phalanx's first successful game.

 There is some nastiness hiding behind this one, but it is good natured nastiness.

Sure it's a bit mundane, but it only takes about 90 seconds.

Quick, enjoyable game of optimizing placement and movement choices that works for kids and adults.  Takes almost as long to set up as it does to play.  The goofy penguin theme helps it from feeling too abstract, and while gameplay is simple the choices grow increasingly difficult as the game goes on.   Helps a lot if you pay attention to the rules (I didn't) and only use two penguins each when you have four players...

Penguins must have a good P.R. agent.  First they have a hit movie with March of the Penguins, and now a new game.  Hey! That’s My Fish! is a game with a cute theme of hungry penguins vying for their next meal.  

The rules are very easy with no ambiguities.  Play is swift:  20 minutes or so seems the usual time frame.  In spite of this, though, the game is quite tactical in nature, and there are numerous important decisions to be made throughout the short duration.  While gathering fish is most important, players must also play defensively in order to prevent opponents from cordoning territory from which they can reap the benefits without outside competition.  Additionally, it is useful to isolate opponents’ penguins so they may no longer move, or only have one or two more fish they can capture before running out of space.  Nasty, but hey -- to the bold goes the most fish!

Hey! That’s My Fish! is fun, fast and tactical, one of those perfect games for when time is short, or when you want to introduce folks to gaming.  The theme is non-threatening, and the rules can be explained in a minute or two.   Yet, the tactics and choices are significant, so skill prevails over randomness.  Plus, who could resist those adorable, smiling penguins?

Sok a pingvin, de túl kevés a hal.
Maximum 4 pingvincsalád versenyez, ki is tud több halat összeszedni a jégmezőn. A gyors szabályismertetés után a rendelkezésedre álló pingvinjeiket a játékosok egymás után lehelyezik az előkészített jégmező (ennek előkészítése a játék leghosszabb feladata) egyik olyan lapkájára, amelyen csak 1 halacska van (van még olyan lapka is, amelyen 2 vagy 3 hal található, persze ezekből nagyságrendileg már kevesebb). Játékosszámtól függően 2-4 pingvint indíthatsz el a mezőn.
A körödben a 6 oldalú lapka 6 irányából az egyiken tudsz egy pingvineddel mozogni egy vagy több mezőt választásod szerint. Két dologra kell figyelned: se nem léphetsz át másik pingvinen, sem üres mezőn. Ahonnan elléptél, azt a lapkát megkapod és a rajta lévő halacskák száma adja a végén a pontszámodat.
Az értékesebb lapkákért komoly csaták folynak, de néha a nevető harmadik ügyes lépésekkel lezárja a viaskodók területét, lehetetlenné téve mozgásukat. Itt bizony egymás ellen tesznek a pingvinek, mert csak egyetlen család lakhat jól, illetve jobban a végén.
Könnyed játék, egyszerű szabályokkal, amelyekből kellemes játék kerekedik ki. A család kisebb tagjai részére is ideális szórakozás lehet.

This game surprised the heck out of me.  Thought it was going to be really wishy washy, but there is a decent amount of strategy in choosing where your penguins go.  Could have easily been an abstract game; it just happens to have fish on the tiles instead of numbers.  Really quite fun :)

Finally got the physical version and really like the penguin poses

Very good on BSW.  Reminds me of YINSH in the movement of the penguins, and the blocking off of pieces; and Through the Desert or the second half of Fjords, where you are trying to contain areas, and deciding which areas are a priority.

Fast and fun.

I think it might lose some of it's bite with more than 2 players.

Picked up 2nd hand to play with my children. And they really liked it, both loving the theme and simplicity of the rules. Obviously far too light for an all adult table, but perfect with the wee ones.
It was a close call whether we set it up again, or my daughter went out on her brand new skates. The skates won,  but only just, it was a very close call. Which is high praise for the game in this house! 
When my lad saw his dad isolate one of his penguins for the 1st time. The realisation and look of horror on his face was a picture! But I could hear the gears ticking in his bonce. Revenge forming in his minds eye within a heartbeat! 
Box says 20 minutes but it's the other side of 15, 5 mins of that being set up.

Very nice pieces, and a fun theme, but it is very pasted-on. This feels like an abstract, not like being a penguin. But it is a fun abstract. As with most abstract multi-player games, sitting next to the new player can be a big advantage. In my first game, I realized that I had given the game to the player on my left with one bad move. Still, it is very replayable, and the game is never the same. This one is quite competitive as a 2-player game.

RATING: 6
This is a good 20-minute filler game.  It's easy to learn and play (even for younger kids), but could turn into an analysis-paralysis fest if you wanted to.  The 2-player game could seriously be compared to chess with penguins!  The main strategy is to block off other players so that you have a monopoly on a large section of ice floes which you can then pick up at your leisure.  However, I think that where you place your penguins initially is more critical to the outcome than any tactical moves during the game.  Also, if two (or more) players gang up on another player, that player is probably going to lose, which could invalidate the best-planned strategy.  In a 4-player game, you have only 2 penguins and so have little chance of planning far in advance.

So, I'd generally conclude that this is a random filler game; just enjoy it for what it is and don't think too hard about it. :)

Good game in the aspect of easy- and fastness(?).Easy to learn, fast to start, fast and easy to play (although it offers something for the strategic mind) and short time to finish a game.I played it some times with both adults and kids, and it was appreciated.As the tiles shows the value, we tried a variant with some of the tiles facing down, so to give the game a little bit more of surprise aspect. Good for beginners, but I can imagine that the game will fade after 20-30 times. But as a fast, short and quick game, it is really good.

Great vicious little multi-player abstract with shrinking space. While the game is one part valuation (i.e., which move earns me the most points?), the possibility of cutting people off altogether through a bit of opportune positional play makes this meaner than it looks -- the doubled goals prevent this from becoming a shear exercise in tactical optimizing. The set up time for a physical copy takes a bit away from its quick nature, but I also don't think that it's as bad as some make it out to be.

RATING: 7
[Initial Impression: 7] 
This game is quite deep for such a quick, fun, and light-feeling game. It has the advantage of being incredibly intuitive and fast to teach, but allowing enough strategic flexibility in the intial positioning and responding to your opponents to make it worth returning to again and again. Even though it would play just as well as a pure abstract, the theme actually enhances the fun, as you can gloat as you grab fish that other players were clearly aiming for.  The strategy is all about positioning yourself to trap opponents on small ice floes, watching them float off to starve, while simultaneously trying to trap yourself on a large ice floe so that you can float off to get fat on a solo feast of fish.  Don't make the mistake of going for quick 3-fish tiles, since you can sometimes guarantee yourself a much larger score by taking a well-positioned 1-fish tile.  The four-player game feels as though it is spread too thin, as you only have 2 penguins to work with and more turns before you can act again - I wonder if getting a second set to make a larger board and using more penguins per player would revitalize the four-player game.  The two- and three-player games are both excellent, however. 

After more plays, I think I like this best as a two-player face-off, which really showcases the strategic opposition and the zero-sum nature of the game.  With 3 players (and also with 4), it actually requires a funny bit of cooperation between sets of players - Players A and B have to make sure C doesn't corner off a large section of the board, B and C have to work together against A, and A and C have to join forces against B.  This is all happening simultaneously and implicitly, and you obviously don't want to make a move that meets this coordinated aim at the expense of hurting yourself.  What this means is that the game can really suffer if one or more players fails to keep in mind this "semi-teaming" aspect of the game.

This is an interesting area control game.  I've only had the chance to play with two players, so I feel my rating might go up after playing with three or four.

The short playtime is nice, as well as ease of explanation.  It feels a bit like chess with just two.  The penguin theme helps a lot for this type of game, whereas a game like Tigris & Euphrates feels very dry and the theme is just as dry.

I have the Silver Line edition, so the small box size is awesome for transportation.  There is no reason for me to not bring such a small box along, just in case.  I feel like it might not have enough depth for the long term, and feels too directly competitive to be a great entry point for new gamers.  We'll see how it balances out.

RATING: 7
Deceptively simple little game, that is accessible to family and friends, young and old. Under the amusing penguin theme, it is actually a profound abstract, much like multi-player Go or Othello--minutes to learn, a lifetime to master! The 3P is cutthroat with each player maneuvering three penguins; like Go, there are several 'battles' raging simultaneously, vying for territory, capturing valuable fish tiles, and cutting off opponents. Like Go or Shogi, tempo is key--the first one to move to the correct spot could prove devastating to others, but may result in giving up an opportunity elsewhere. The 4P is a tad more chaotic, as it is much more difficult to discern the optimum move, since it is always changing with every opponent's play! Quick, deep, and fun. The deluxe version with the 3D penguins rocks. Initial rating is an '8'.

Update (05/27/12) 20 plays: 3P is the sweet spot. With 3x penguins, each player has enough options to somewhat control the outcome. The outcome for 4P seems like a crapshoot. Two penguins is not enough. It is more of a game of "Chicken", to see who blinks first and cedes area to the other player(s).

Update (08/04/12) 25 plays: Yes, 4P is chaotic. It is strongly driven by what the other three players do collectively. A boneheaded move by one player can easily give the game to another, so the 4P is fragile, easily breakable. It is probably better to approach the 4P game as more family-level fun, rather than any meaningful mental exercise. Dropping to a '7'.

We really want this one. Played it at a nearby game shop that has games for rent and it has the right balance of theme and strategy. I like the idea of finding some cool penguin figures to replace the wooden ones. We've since resolved how to deal with retiring penguins and whether or not to score the final fish (we like the idea that penguins eat the fish when they land on the ice and the ice melts when they leave, which means you score the tiles when you retire, though we can see not scoring the tiles if we agree to that at the beginning of the game)

RATING: 7
A quick, fun, abstract game that's genuinely appealing to both children and adults and is thinky enough to reward a certain amount of strategising without being at all hard to pick up for the first time. 

The FF edition would maybe benefit from less fiddly pieces (in the form of larger, thicker tiles) but if you're looking for a family-friendly, all-ages, penguin-themed filler, this is the way to go!

Juego de relleno que se juega en 20 min, pero sorpresivamente estratégico. Cada jugador controla a un grupo de pingüinos que se desplazan por un tablero modular para capturar peces de diferente valor. Sin embargo, cada vez que se mueve un pingüino el jugador debe remover del tablero la ficha de la que salió el pingüino; así el tablero se va achicando mientras avanza el juego. Divertido.

penguin uses slide ... it's supereffective! because it appeared somewhat thin (i. e. no more "discoveries" in future plays) in the beginning, the game'e rating started with solid 7; the simplicity though, a slight bias for abstract concepts, short game time, superb components (deluxe edition), the fact it's easy to teach and captivating + its flexibility (serves all board gaming needs, from more thinky approaches to casual, rather careless play) grew on me and thus raised my rating to 9

HtmF! claims company with the small, elite group of quick, painless fillers that actually hold some depth.  The game can be explained in less than a minute and played faster than the time you spend to set it up.  There's plenty of decision making and the bits are cute.  I really like this game when that downtime mood drifts in at the end of an elongated, stressful workday.  Plus, I'm always attracted to tactical excercises like this little gem.

06-12 - I bought this game to play with my 6 yo niece.  It was easy enough that she was able to make her own decisions as far as moving her penguins, but she's not quite there in grasping the strategy of blocking and cutting off.  We offered some suggestions, but let her make her own choices and after losing three games, she was a little frustrated so we moved on.  We'll bring this back out to the table soon because I think it's a good opportunity to introduce her to strategy.

Looks neat.  But at the same time, Through the Desert seems a little similar and cooler...

Finally played it, and gotta say, Through the Desert is a welcome step up from this one.  I wouldn't mind playing it on occasion, and trying out the gobs of variants could be fun, but it's just not quite enough to sell me on it's own.

As many others have said, it takes almost as long to setup as it does to play.  And that's more a statement to how long it takes to setup than how long it takes to play.

Beautiful little strategy game for all ages.  Aim of the game is to move your penguins around a hex grid collecting fish, all the while the previously occupies tiles are being removed to create holes in the ice.

I love the fact you can block off your opponents and strand them on a small chunk of ice, and it's great fun trying to be the first to the most valuable tiles in the grid.  Highly recommended, particularly for families.

Just received in the mail and played two games right away with a 6 year old.  The set up time wasn't that bad, at least there is no separating parts, just a pile of ice floes and wooden penguins.   The game definitely is easy to play and understand, but the choices are not foolproof and the choices to make are varied.  I won the first game, but soundly lost the second one.  I think I made a good choice.

A simple and efficient abstract strategy game. With Penguins. 

I like how the "board" gets smaller and smaller as the game goes on, increasing the tension. It's super fast, and pretty fun for the weight and time it takes to play it. The mechanics don't really fit the theme... I feel like this game is begging for a more morbid re-theming where players are playing as polar bears trying to stay afloat on melting ice flows. I think that would fit perfectly.

My reliable gaming friend was dead on for this, too much set-up for the amount of return. Not only that but once set up the tiles are hard to pick up without disturbing the others. 

Now well these things can sometimes be overlooked in a game here they definitely detract as it is a light 10 minute game. The aspects I did like were the slight screwage factor of stranding an opponent and the 'no luck' factor but the game lacks in many other areas, scoring and strategy being big ones. 

Slightly overated in a TTR kind of way but would be an excellent game for kids and their low attention span or just a light light filler. 

Blokus Trigon and TTD kick all kinds of A__ on this one though.

aka PINGUIN ("Packeis am Pol"). Vier pinguins per speler plaatsen op ijsschotsen met 1, 2 of 3 vissen. Om beurt een van de eigen pinguins verplaatsen (loodrecht op zijden zeshoekjes) zo ver je wilt in rechte lijn, maar je mag niet over andere pinguins of over lege ruimtes. De ijsschots waar je net vandaan komt, krijg je. Wie zo het meeste vissen verzamelt, wint. Duurt slechts ca. 10 min. Best leuk; beetje tactisch ook. Eerste spel dat Pepijn echt leuk vindt.

We own this but I've also made a homemade version using disks instead of hexes: setup is a LOT quicker.

I like this game. It's just enough of a brain-burner that strategy does matter, but the rules are simple enough and there is enough chaos with three and four players that kids are able to play fairly competently.  

The game plays quickly enough that you can easily play "one more" if you feel cheated by all the chaos.

This is a quick, light abstract game that could be renamed "Hey, Don't Block Me!"

I enjoy the way that the initial randomness settles in and gives players a chance to put some order to the chaos. Even if the way the game shakes out puts the player in a bad situation, it's over before it's easy to get to upset about bad luck.

Kids can play this, but there's a real game here as well.  A very quick, simple, area control game that is fun to play.

My two-year-old understands the rules, and likes to move the penguins, but has no concept of winning or strategy (as expected).  She still enjoys to play with the big people though.

I'm planning to pick up a copy of this to bring to family funtions.  Non-gamers will enjoy this, but the gamers can still be satisfied.

A great little abstract gem, hidden behind a facade of what looks like a kids game. Uber-cute penguins; simple rules; quick play.  This could easily be an unofficial member of Project GIPF.

Simple fare, the Missus loves it, as do our teenage neice and nephew. Usually you can spot the winner half the way through as the optimum plays are always very obvious. Known in our house by the more memorable name of 'Hey! That's my Self-Esteem' whenever Liz beats me at it. :)

Fun to play but once everyone knows how to play setup can take longer than the game. So it's a little on the short side, but makes a good filler game between bigger games.  Cute penguins and can be quite cut-throat.

Only played two player so far, and have enjoyed it. A very Go-like game, and that's a good thing.

Lives up to its reputation as a cutthroat game in a cute package. The quick play time makes it suitable for times when some other abstracts would take too long. I haven't played it with more than two enough times to know if it really works well for three and four players; if so, it would be nice to have this type of game available for multiplayer play. 

It can be fun for kids, too, if it's played in a more relaxed way.

Overly-simple collection game where the optimal move is usually obvious, the winner is usually determined mid-game, and one bad move almost guarantees a loss.

This would be a fantastic game if not for the board being such a hassle to pick pieces out of and constantly readjust during play.

Brutal, quick playing, I don't know why people consider it a children's game.  A child should not beat a competent adult at this game.  It is very nasty.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (October 2011)

This is a good game, however I don´t like to play with it very often, not sure why. It is an abstract game with paper thin theme and a peculiar name. For me, it is reminiscent to Through the Dessert and Zombiegeddon, both from Knizia. Its main advantage is the short playtime. It has also some interesting decisions and zero luck after setup. I should like it more, but for some reason I don’t. 

Best with 3 players. 

For now, I’m holding onto my copy of the game, but I will probably sell it.

We bought this game after an initial enjoyment of it, but it turns out our first game/s were played with wrong rules. With the right rules we decided we didn't like it quite so much as we first thought.
:what:
Unfortunately, we haven't been able to recall and recreate the mood of the "wrong" rules we had.
-----------------------------
After 1 play: An elegant abstract which almost could have been a GIPF game, but it ain't... the cute theme lends a little colour without feeling like just pointless artwork. Quick to learn, intriguing to play, just a little slow to set up (vs playing time).

RATING: 7
I love this 2 player (so far the only way I've played it). It's fast, pure strategy, and very cool. The set up vs. game play is a bit tedious, but it's not hard to set up at all (it's just that the game plays faster than the set up time).

You could have some longer games if people spend a lot of time thinking about the moves, but this is a very cool little game and it'll still play pretty quick once people pick up the basic strategy of creating separate ice islands just for your little penguin alone if possible.

Good, and direct, player interaction.

Fun, quick little game.  I'm sure you've already heard how terrible the setup is.  Almost makes it a deterrent to play.  I was gifted the smaller travel version, which would make it nice to play on almost any small tray.  But, I doubt I would ever do that.  Hard to keep hexes from moving around too much when needing to flip tiles over.  Spent a lot of time pushing things back to where they belong so we knew how the penguins could travel.  Highlight was that my 5 year old beat us(with a bit of help) and it made her day.  Anything that can help encourage a love for board games, is still okay in my book.

El juego tiene una o dos reglas, creo recordar, la verdad es que es muy facilito.

Las partidas arrancan bien, intentando rodear a tus rivales para eliminarlos del juego, pero una vez que ocurre esto y los pingüinos quedan aislados, el juego es un ver pasar los turnos para que acabe sabiendo ya como va a quedar la partida.

La gracia del juego es tener a tus rivales cerca y cerrales los caminos, una vez pasado ese periodo el juego se acaba, aunque siga quedando partida.

Se trata de un juego táctico, en el que los movimientos adecuados son vitales, pero es un juego muy corto y no da para grandes cosas. El hecho de eliminar las losetas no permite que se pueda desarrollar una estrategia, pero tampoco que se alargue la partida.

Simple rules, deep game. No, really! You would think, on reading the rules, it would be nothing more than move and collect some fish, but once the ice starts to get limited, and your paths are limited, and other players' penguins are all making a grab for that area filled with 3-fish tiles, it can become cut-throat and lending itself to several moments of pondering just what the best move is.

Awful title, but cool penguin meeples.  The setup is a little bit of a pain, mainly because it's such a quick game.  But the rules are very easy to explain and totally intuitive.  It seems like players need to be all at about the same skill level to be on equal footing here, players skilled at abstracts and forward thinking should excel.  Having multiple pieces creates a little more confusion and unpredictability, which is nice.  Even though the setup is annoying, it's nice how the board cleans itself up as you play.  I like how this plays very quickly, it's whimsical and fun, though it can get pretty vicious.

Such a good game. You think, "Oh look at the cute little penguins, it must be great for little kids."  But you're wrong.  This is one of the most selfish, cut-throat games you can play.  Every move you make screws over your opponents, and possibly yourself.  The board gets very small, very fast.  It's evil; pure evil.


If you can find it, get the older version with the larger tiles, which helps with set up time because the pieces don't feel so much like fiddly bits.  The larger tiles are easier for adults to manipulate and I believe makes set up much faster.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A nasty little filler where you try to trap your opponent's pieces to stop them from scoring. Fortunately the game is so quick that its not that big a deal. Its also one of the easiest games to teach.

This game is so abstract, it almost feels like a GIPF game but with more colorful bits.

RATING: 8
A simple game, but the best part is that it was designed by Lithuanian. A game runs pretty quickly and doesn't need too much thinking. Of course, players must decide how to cut off largest possible area for their penguins, but more often - how to cut off smallest possible area for their opponent. Moreover, even though the game box is much too big, game components look beautiful and of good quality.

Paprastas žaidimas, o kas geriausia - sukurtas lietuvio. Žaidimas vyksta pakankamai greitai ir nereikalauja daug mąstymo. Žinoma, reikia pagalvoti kaip kuo didesnį plotą atsikirsti sau, bet dažniau - kaip kuo mažesnį atkirsti priešininkui. Ir dar, nors žaidimo dėžė gerokai per didelėje, komponentai iš tiesų yra visai gražūs ir geros kokybės.

good game that would see more table time if it could be set up quicker.

RATING: 4
While the box is pleasantly small and the little plastic penguins are hard to resist, this game is just a pain to set up.  Once you're done setting it up, you'll find the pieces to be difficult to remove without disturbing the hive you worked so hard on.  Use something with suction, like a Nerf dart, to take away tiles during the game.  Gameplay is fun enough, but the setup ruins this experience for me and hinders my desire to play it.

RATING: 7
A great blending of tactics and strategy that could be a nice tool for teaching game theory. Other than that I think this is super for three players. With four it might be too easy to lose both penguins - with three you have three penguins which also means more possibilities. With two this could be an AP-trap - with three it is much more open. FFG version with its mini box is very convenient, but deluxe version's bigger tiles are much easier to handle.

Quick, simple and very cutthroat abstract game. Somewhat chaotic with more than two players, as one player's move never hurts the other players symmetrically, but this is part of the fun. Possibly the tiles should not be scored differently, as this adds to the randomness.

A zippy little abstract game where you try to collect more fish than your opponent(s) with your little penguins.  The biggest complaint I hear about this one is that it takes too long to setup.

Definitely a game that will remain in my collection, I have the large box version which I find a lot nicer than the small one. It is however a game that with the more players you add the less control you will have over the board which can be frustrating.

Good: Very short, easily explained.

Penguins are moved across tiles, always taking the tile they left. Once all penguins can no longer move, count up the fish on the tiles.

This is a great abstract filler game for 2 to 4 players. You need to think a lot especially in a two player game, because in a 3 or 4 player game if the others don't like you they will quickly eliminate you :P This game is very easy, with a bit of luck concerning the initial setup. The only problem of this game is the long setup which sometimes is longer than the whole game. You also should avoid playing this game with slowthinkers. All in all, this is a very good game which is never the same.

Hey! That's My Fish! is a game I sometimes shudder to bring out because it looks so juvenile but it's a deep, cerebral game that in some ways plays like a multiplayer YINSH or Othello. It plays quick, is very easy to learn, and I haven't played it with a person that didn't like it. 

The largest problem with Hey! That's My Fish! is the setup time. The setup time is roughly half the time for each game - this has always felt very tedious. This remains a small point of contention but it is a fundamental component of any board game's experience, so anyone interested in buying it should consider it.

RATING: 8
This is a great game.  Quick and fun.  You can make it a quick, casual game or you can take your time and really get into the strategy.  I'm rating this an 8 but it's quite possibly a 9.  Oh, and I think the complaints of "long set-up time" are unfounded.  It takes maybe two minutes to set it up.  Download the paper placement guide and it can be set up in seconds.

Hey, this ain't fun!  Well, okay, lots of other people will enjoy it, but I can't stand these perfect information games. I can't look at the board and see 15 moves ahead like my opponents always seem to be able to, so I always lose horribly. Losing horribly isn't necessarily a deal-breaker, but I always know the only reason for it is that everyone just plays so much better than me. So, boo!

After seeing this game played once I could see that it's a wargame in sheep's clothing. After playing a few times, this game is even more ruthless than I could have imagined!

Still, I can imagine that its simple rules and ease of gameplay would make it fun for all ages, provided the correct proportions of mercy. Just as fun with the family as it is with the hardcore wargamers.

I was pretty excited about getting this with all the positive press it's gotten, but it just leaves me a little unfulfilled.

I built a home-grown set of this game with white poker chips and hand-drawn fishes.  I create 4 sets of penguins using backing clay by Sculpey [url]http://www.sculpey.com/[/url].  I incorporated the "pushing penguins" and "hidden orca" rules.  The game was played with my nieces and nephews; ages 4-6.  They loved the game!  I thought that the game-play was a bit limited but I'd play again if my young in-laws would want to.

I got this game because I heard it belonged to the "seconds to learn, ages to master" school of game design. I was not disappointed.

First things first: the game only works with two. More than that and it becomes extremely chaotic and uncontrollable.

Now, if you do play with just two, it's a very solid tactical game which can be taught and finished in minutes. Components are lovely, and the more modern editions, which are quite small, can be easily carried around.

As long as games for two which can be finished in ten minutes or less, this is the best one I've played. The biggest issue it has is it's cumbersome to set up.

Pinguïn from Phalanx Games is an easy, light and very fast abstract strategy game (although it looks like a game for kids). Fence off your area and get those fish! Minor point: set-up time takes almost as much as actually playing the game. Too short to be really impressive.

Traditional Isolation -type calculatable abstract with perfect information and no luck. Good players can say who'll win after couple of moves, which is actually great, since it makes the game end quickly. Best thing about Packeis am Pol is, that thanks to its high rating its easy to sell your copy to the next victim.

good filler :)
It is a whole different game with four than with two. With two it was actually quite light. With four however it became much more tense. With two play was quick. With four players there was sometimes some slowdown when a player thought too long about a move. But because the board changed all the time this wasn't much of a problem. The quality of the tiles are not comparable to the ones of carcasonne. But this isn't much of a problem. 
***Update*** After playing "Through the Desert rating drops. I still give it a 7 because it is a fun game. And the problem that a weaker player can decide the winner in one turn isn't here.
There is however another problem. That is that the endgame is an anti-climax. Because whole areas disappear from the board.  These secluded areas work much better in through the desert.

In Hey, That's My Fish!, players want to catch as many fish as possible with their waddle of penguins. Each turn, a player moves one penguin in a straight line over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. The player then collects the hex from where the penguin started its movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which penguins can't cross on future turns. When a penguin can't move, it's removed from play with its owner claiming the tile on which it stands. The player who collects the most fish wins.

It's just too short for its own good but a fine game of tactic and logic with a little Through the Desert feel (probably it's only because it's a simple area enclosure game with hexes worth 1, 2, 3 points and also a set-up and a playing phase).

Extremely fast, simple, ultra accessible filler.  You can play this with kids and/or grandparents.  Obviously too shallow for my taste but still decent tactics and a good introduction into the hobby.  Deluxe version has these very catchy toy-like pieces that's always a hit with non-gamers.

RATING: 8
You can play it strategic or for fun. The first will take forever, the other is faster, but who wins will be a bit random. The best solution is to do a little bit of both. Think, but don't overthink. 
It works as well with 2 players as it does with three or four.

CUTE and fun.  The setup isn't long, really.  It's just sort of an effort to get out the box and set up all the pieces for a five minute game.  And it's not THAT good, so we don't end up playing it often.

"Tuxedoes fight it out over one big shrinking iceberg!"  Penguins carve out portions of an iceberg pangea with a limited quantity of fish.  After a penguin leaves a ice hex (eats the fish), it leaves an empty spot.  A good fast filler.

Picit macerás az előkészülete, amikor szépen hexagonális rácsban lerakjuk a sok lapkát, utána viszont már pofonegyszerű, hangulatos kis játék. Lehet benne gonoszkodni, hiszen ez alapvetően egy kiszorítós játék, amiben az ellenfél pingvinjeit célszerű egy minél kisebb szigetre beszorítani, hogy én meg egy nagyobb jégsziget erőforrásait (halait) eszegethessem meg szép nyugisan, nem tartva attól, hogy eleszik előlem őket.

Szóval élvezetes kis logikai játék, de túl rövidnek érzem, és ahhoz képest túl hosszúnak a pálya összeállítását.

I don't mind dressing an abstract in these frosty tuxedoes.  I just wish the underlying game were more worthy of my attention.  Too, I can't stand the way these cheap cardboard tiles slide around and make it hard to see what's left of the board.

A nice filler that feels limited. Although the potential for a really cut throat game exists between two seasoned players, most games are over quickly, with the likely winner becoming obvious early on. Setting the pieces up is cumbersome and time consuming for such a short game.

Light, simple, but interesting "tile removal" game.  Can be played with 6  year old children.  Strategy is present, albeit sometimes a little bit difficult to follow (tiles disappear quickly after your turn).  Tactics is always present.

The setup is bothersome: it takes too much time.

RATING: 5
A fast paced game about getting more fish than your fellow penguins. This is a childrens game for sure, but plays well with adults as well. The setting up part is a bit annoying with the small tiles, but that's not a big issue. There isn't much meat on the game though, so it doesn't stand too much playing. The small size makes it easily transportable.

UPDATE: The setting up part IS an issue...

RATING: 4
A very fun game - its biggest appeal, aside from the fact it has penguins, is that a game will take about 15 minutes to play. This makes it great not only as a filler between games or to wrap up the evening, but also for when you don't have a lot of time to put something on the table.

A great little game aside from the set up. It's the perceived time dilation of the set up being disproportionate to the play time. There are a few games like this one and Memoir '44 where it feels like it takes as long or longer to set up vs. play. 

It's one of those irrational beliefs that quantitative data won't defy. You could stopwatch me setting it up and concretely prove that the set up is super short, but that don't change my feeling that it's very long.

March of the Penguins vs Battle Royale.  While the theme blows a raspberry at all the seriousness in the world with greedy penguins that is only the tip of the iceberg.  Below the waterline is a deep tradition of abstract games. 

A simple move and remove mechanism, on a random board of hexagonal tiles, grabbing land while cutting down your opponents options is nothing new but it is given an invigorating twist by the scoring system (not every ice tile is the same with either one, two or three fish (points) on offer) which provide some interesting choices - there is the chance that the last penguin standing will not always be the winner.  Recommended for an abstract fan who wants to introduce their hobby to non-gamers in a irreverant way.

Made a re-themed personal copy using hexagonal floor tiles painted with dragonflies and plastic toy frogs, and for that reason at least a little of my rating is nostalgic/pride based. Even so, it doesn't make the game table as much as it should, and for that reason I'm ambivalent about it at the moment. Kirk, who is a bit better at abstraction than I am, won the last few times we've played. Will have to give it some more tries.

RATING: 6
While essentially this is an abstract family game, it makes sense thematically for the ice floes to disappear as you move the penguins move around, and that you can't change directions as you slide across the ice. The placing of the penguins to box in someone is important, and you need to balance getting the good tiles with not losing your penguins too early. At the same time, sometimes it is beneficial to cut off a section of the board so that only you have access to it. All in all, a nice easy filler that can be played strategically by gamers or chaotically for laughs by non gamers alike.

Cardboard thickness of the ice floes is good and there are 4 unique molds for the penguin models.

Meets the most desirable traits of a filler; Quick, plays well with 2. About on the level of Fjords but better than Poison or Lost Cities in my opinion.

Played three times.

Ken:
Approachable, incredibly fast-playing title that excels with 2 - 4 players.  With 2 players, plays like an area control game.  Luck in tile placement, but otherwise entirely tactical abstract.  Cute theme, although mechanics would work with anything.  Would be appropriate for family or kid play.  Sold as it didn't really have a place in my collection.

Would be happy to play again.  Might be a future re-acquisition when there is a smaller player in the picture.

Constructed Jan 2006

This is an excellent game. Short and sweet, but good tension. After three plays my sister exclaims, "This is WAY better than Ticket to Ride!"

DIY
16 penguins (4 each in 4 colours)
60 hex tiles 30x1 fish, 20x2 fish, 10x3 fish, water on the reverse

Lowered my rating after playing 2 player. It is an excellent game but some of the shine has worn off a bit for me. I prefer it with more than 2.

One of those odd games that looks cute, like a kids' game, but in fact it's a fairly thoughtful abstract. You need to look a few turns ahead to do well, something I don't really like in games. The cute penguin pieces and theming seem to let people relax, and just play by gut-feel a bit more. In the end, it's something my kids can play (the rules are simplicity itself), but aren't very excited about.

I found this game completely underwhelming and even though it only took 15 minutes, I felt I could have used those 15 minutes better elsewhere.  Too simple and lacks anything resembling fun.  Might be OK as a kids game, but even then might be too boring.  It felt like an exercise and not a game.

Wow. Gotta break with the BGG masses here. Like Balloon Cup, I feel kinda betrayed by this one. *sniffle*

It's just not very fun, really. Pretty cut-throat, and maybe more screwage than you might want for a supposedly 'fun little filler'. And it's kind of a pain to set up, for what you get.

It does, however have wooden penguins. So it's got that going for it.

Maybe with kids?

A light positional game, able to play with kids. Fun theme and quite fast to play (5 min 2 players).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is an abstract with cute pieces (love the penguins!) and a light theme, and it's a good one. It only has a couple of rules, and those are easy to teach -- including to kids.

In our first play, my kiddo -- age 7 -- scored 37 points to my 43. Which is awesome! It's easy to pick up, and I can see strategies that will emerge over time.

It packs a lot into about 10 minutes, too. Not as much as, say, Hive, but it's not TRYING to be Hive, either. It's a light, fun abstract that's good for mixed age groups, which offers an enjoyable amount of depth.

---

So far, good with both 2 and 3 players.

Setup is a bit fussy, since the tiles are small and the "board" has no retaining elements. It's also pretty fiddly in play, since it's easy to mess up the whole array by bumping a tile...and you pick up a tile every turn.

Playing on a cloth surface would help.

---

Also good with four players. I continue to be surprised by how solid -- and nasty, in terms of hosing each other -- this game is.

I also use this game to strengthen his math skills as I have him stack his fish piles in different increments such as 5's, 10's, etc.

Wow. Just Wow. Its pretty. Its SOOOOO simple yet surprising. Board shrinks, the most obvious strategy isn't the best, you have to plan where you'll end up. Easy enough for a kid to play, intreguing enough for the gamer = perfect match. That's value! This one is going to grow on us. I would have rated it higher, but its just so simple. Maybe that does make it perfect and it should be higher.. time will tell.

RATING: 7.5
Fine as a little filler. Abstract, but really not too deep or fulfilling enough to be great. Set up takes longer than the game, while not a deal breaker is slightly off-putting. I do enjoy this more than many of the filler card games we play and it has a fun theme which appealed to my silly friends. Will happily play this as a filler, not as a satisfying abstract. Edit: This has actually turned out to be one of our most played fillers. It is one of those unique games that is great for kids and still keeps adults interested, and can be played silly or as a more serious abstract. Really like this one!

Simple, easy-to-learn abstract game.  The cartoon theme hides a very nice abstract game underneath, with few rules and lots of depth.  As a pure abstract, I'd say it's best with two as multiple player interactions can be unbalanced, but for a casual play it's fun no matter how many.

I am disappointed I waited so long before trying this out.  It sat for over a year on my shelf.  My son and I tried it just the other day and I think it is awesome.  The only reason it didn't get an eight is because the board setup takes a couple minutes.

A very good abstract game with a nice theme suitable for kids and adults alike.  The strategy reminds me a bit of Through the Desert (if you can secure your own little area with little effort you can pick up some easy points).

10/30/12 Played two three-player games. This game nominally has a theme, but to me its just an abstract game about creating enclosures (roping off territory).

Le plateau de jeu est composé de 60 tuiles "bloc de glaces" qui représentent la banquise. Chacun de ces morceaux de banquise contient de 1 à 3 poissons. Les joueurs vont pouvoir y placer leurs pingouins en espérant pouvoir s'empiffrer un maximum.

A son tour, un joueur peut déplacer un de ses pingouins horizontalement jusqu'à rencontrer un obstacle(un autre pingouin, la fin de la banquise). En partant, il récupère la tuile sur laquelle il était. Petit à petit, la banquise se réduit donc et de pauvres pingouins vont se retrouver isolé, tout juste bon à démarrer leur marche d'empereur, le ventre presque vide ! C'est triste la vie d'un pingouin !!!

Le jeu se termine quand plus aucun joueur ne peut déplacer un pingouin. Le vainqueur est celui qui possède le plus de poissons.

Hey! That's My Fish est la réédition d'un jeu sorti en 2003, de manière plutôt confidentiel, chez Bambus Spieleverlag sous le nom de Pingvinas.

Fun abstract that everyone can pick up and have some vague understanding of strategy. I guess you could get good at it - but the reward for it isn't really there. It's still a fun 10 minutes though, and I'd break it out more often if it wasn't such a hassle to piece together the hex-grid board. I'm not sure what else to say, it's very simple, very quick, but still gives you quite a lot to consider. Also, in a multiplayer game you have the opportunity to "collude" via moves-as-offers. Two players cutting of the third by coordinating moves so they can share the greater island. Fun, though I'm considering to look at Battle Sheep as a similar game with easier set up.

A great little, fast and fun game for all ages.  Every play has gotten a little more intense and thoughtful as to strategies, but it never stops being great fun.  The "hardest" part of the game is setting up the tiles in alignment.  One of the all-time best fillers and a great intro to gaming.

Game in a Nutshell: Teams of Penguins move around a sheet of ice, breaking it up along the way, while trying to secure the most fish.

Played as: 2 (Yucata.de), 3 player (live)

Pros: It toes the line with simplicity and cute-factor for casual gamers and tactically intensity for more gamery gamers making it a excellent middle-ground for all types of people. Has a structured but organic flow to the game that appeals to me.

Cons: Maybe too simple at times as it can feel samey. It's possible for a player to eliminate themselves earlier in the game with a few bad moves. Likewise, the game can become very cut-throat and mean with blocking and similar tactics... which will be nice for some but also possibly hurt the feelings of others.

Other: If you really want to play up the cute factor, you can't go wrong with the deluxe edition which adds so much personality to the game. If you don't go deluxe, then you're still getting a game with solid mechanics.

Best Use: An introductory game that can grow to be a light brainburner.

Great. Should not be pigeonholed as a kids' game, although it does benefit from rules that can be explained in a minute. The long jumps add something to the tactical options. Best for two of course; viable for three but some room for double-teaming; a bit of a mess for four. 

As much as I enjoy HTMF, it's never going to get into that upper pantheon of abstract games for me, since once you decide on a goal (isolating a particular one of your opponents penguins, for example), there is usually one clear best way to accomplish that. I've seen long jumps used effectively, but the situations for that are relatively rare. There isn't much in the way of forks (even though it is good to play over lunch). So while I rate HTMF solely as a 2er (with more, it would go down), it stays safely below something like Twixt.

Please don't bother turning the tiles over or matching the exact array shown in the rules; just spread em out and play!

"The game plays fantastically at 2P, though initial placement can often have far-reaching impacts. At 3P and 4P, the board becomes very crowded, and there is a lot of 'ganging up on the leader' in play.

The theme is very lightly pasted on, but the game itself is strategic and cutthroat. One of my top 10 abstract games, if only the set-up were not so fiddly."

I enjoy this, and see 2 player as a particularly full on conflict type game.  3-4 is fun, but there is enough chaos that the personal attack feel of the 2 player game is diluted.  I've played it with 5 year olds, teenagers and adults and its been enjoyable every time, but when I played with my brother, it was WAR! :) 

Like most about it - quick and simple to explain and introduce, pretty small and portable, has enough tension/competition to get a but of cursing going on (in adult only games of course).

Like least - slightly fiddly setup each time.

My girlfriend, Dana, picked this game for us to play, because it has a silly title. It ended up being a super interesting game, and I'm glad she picked it.

Players move their penguins along ice, but as they move, the ice begins to disappear. Eventually, penguins can become trapped, which leads to much of the strategy of the game. How can I keep my penguins free and mobile, while forcing your penguins into a corner?

Hey, That's My Fish is quick and easy. More like quick and icy! lolololololol

(iOS version)  Streamlined, simple, light, but still strategic abstract game with a cutesy theme.  Think I probably prefer the digital version to the actual boardgame, since set-up and scoring is such a breeze, and the game only lasts 5-10 minutes anyway.  Great if you need a (very) quick game.

Mivel úgy láttam, hogy az előkészületek elég macerásak a hexák miatt, ráadásul kezd már helyhiány lenni a játékdobozoknak köszönhetően, úgy döntöttem, hogy megveszem Android app változatban.

Röviden: nem bántam meg.

Hosszabban: faék egyszerűségű szabályokkal rendelkező absztrakt taktikázós játék, amit már kisgyerekkel is lehet játszani, de a finomságok miatt (szükséges hozzá több lépés előre tervezése) a nagyobb küzdelem inkább felnőttekkel jön ki. Szóval gyerekjáték is, meg nem is, olyan tipikus 5-99 év közötti kategória.

Az appban egész jó az AI, három nehézségi fokozattal, kifejezetten jó vele játszani.

Tetszett. Fillernek, 1-2 perces játéknak tökéletes (legalábbis az appban, ahol nem kell setupolni).

What a great game! This looks like a small kids game (and to be sure, small children can play it) But it turns out to be a real game of strategy with 3 elements: get to the tiles with the most fish, try and cut your opponents adrift on small ice flows and try to cut yourself adrift on a large iceflow and hoover up all the fish. Its really quick, the rules couldn't be easier and it can be played by any age.

This is my son's game (got it for Christmas '06).

The game is extremely straightforward; you set up a playing field of hexes with fish on them, place your penguins on the grid, and each turn you move your penguin and remove the hex that the penguin was last on.  Repeat until nobody can move any of their penguins, then count up the number of fish each person has acquired.

Light?  Oh, yes; it would float away if given the chance.  Fun?  Yes, it's light filler-type fun.  Is it the centerpiece of a gaming night?  Um, no; if you end up with this as the big game in a gaming session, then it was a light evening indeed.

Within it's sphere (light filler-type games), it works very well.  Don't try to make it any more than what it is, and the game is fine.  The rating reflects the reality of the game for what type of game it is and whether it fills that need, no more, no less.

Simple to teach and learn with, in Deluxe form, great components . The Penguin figures  appeal to younger players and draws them in like magnet,( just as Panda does in Takenoko), making it a fantastic family game.   Quickest playing on my top 10 list, but one of the more tactical,  but playing non-competitvely with gamers and non-gamers and families is most rewarding. 

This is one of the longest residents of my top 10 list, being on the list since the Deluxe version came out and never dropping off since.

I have now played this game in a number of occasions with my 6 year old and my wife.
The game is simple enough for my daughter to understand what is going on but at the same time I personally do not find it challenging for an adult (possibly because I tend to win without having to think).
For my daughter is all about grabbing fish without thinking where she's going to end up and for my wife....no comment.
Enjoyable family game but nothing too exciting.

A very solid little filler game that sets up and play in 10-15 minutes. Excellent with kids and adults which is also a big positive. It feels like a bit of a cross between Trias and YINSH but the gameplay is different from those.

A very "efficient" design where the designer has gotten a lot of mileage out of a few bits and a mechanism.

This is essentially an abstract but the fun theme of penguins "fishing" on ice floes works well IMO.

Certainly a game worth owning and one of the very best fillers in my collection.

An abstract game that features 60 tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. Each player has a number of penguins. After they move, the penguin eats the tile they are on, earning those number of fish as victory points. Movement is straight in any direction, but blocked by gaps in ice floe or other penguins.  It's a very cute, very simple game that plays quickly. I have played twice with four players, where it is slightly  chaotic, but I imagine the two or three player game can be quite strategic. Also, the first player has a slight advantage in being able to seed their penguins first and get the first move to capture fish.

Cute little brightly coloured and characterful penguins! And they're running around snatching fish! And while they're doing so, someone will get cut off on a little patch of ice and yell "NOOOOOOOO!" It's fast and fun and you'll almost forget it's also a serious abstract strategy game.

I've never seen people stare so intently at a set of cute little cartoon penguins.

Its an excellent abstract with a theme!

This is an elegant little game -- ultra-simple rules.  It's very abstract, but this doesn't detract from the game for me since it's so short -- you can probably play a round of this in 5-10 minutes.  The only nuisance is that the game takes almost as much time to set up as it does to play!

When I was first introduced to this, and similarly whenever I first introduce people to it, people end up thinking it looks like a kids game; then you start playing and realise within a turn or two just how ruthless and tactical it can be.

Like the penguin in Fight Club, all you do in Hey! That's My Fish! is "Slide!"

A simple game with very limited strategy based on isolating your opponent's penguins from the main ice flow. Games take almost as long to set up as to play, which isn't that long at all.

I bought this with the intention of giving it to my niece for her birthday. Unlike A La Carte, which I purchased for the same reason, this game I won't be sorry to see go. Its not bad, just not enough game for an adult. Play Through The Desert instead, for a more complex game with a similar feel.

The game is deceptive.  The theme and layout pretend to be a child's game.  The reality, to me, is that this may be one of the deepest strategy/tactics games I own.  I may never forget the knowing look and laughter my Dad and I shared after one of my moves threatened to cut one half of the board off.  My Mom was clueless as I saw my Dad's understanding of the game change in his eyes.  My Mom played me later and did quite well, doing much better than she predicted.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not want to play this all the time
-> I enjoy this in little bits at a time.  The abstractness of it wears on me after a while - too many variables that really require more analysis time than I want to spend.
+ I will suggest it for sure and will not turn down a game

Vicious little abstract, I have it on iPad as well and that is nice because the only annoying part is the setup, it would be nice if the tiles were a bit bigger/chunkier to help with that.  My wife and I call it "Penguin Bastards" and it is a much more appropriate title.  Simple, quick, fun.

RATING: 9
Complementing the well-known shrinking board mechanism with the unequal tiles pretty much dismantles all strategies to conquer space from other similar games, and having the tiles put at random just keeps the interest every round of play. A good setup and a strategy are vital to succeed, but a single right choice at the right moment can be decisive as well.

So we're left with a very flexible game, accessible but intricate, entertaining straight from the first round, replayable and - what is best - it works wonders for any number of players involved.

RATING: 7
Travestito da gioco per bambini è in realtà un ottimo gioco strategico di piazzamento. Simpatico e veloce è un gioco che consiglio, la possibilità di creare ad ogni partita un 'tabellone' differente lo rende longevo. Regole semplici, setup un po' noioso e lento. Esistono diverse versioni, quella italiana (Pinguin Pescatore) ha una scatola troppo grande rispetto al contenuto; vista l'indipendenza della lingua consiglio la versione inglese (Hey, That's My Fish!) oppure la versione Deluxe della Phanlanx, più grande ma con materiali migliori. Il gioco mi è piaciuto talmente che alla fine ne ho tre copie.

RATING: 7
The simplest rules so often generate the best games, and there is no better indicator of this fact than here. This little penguin-shifting gem (totally abstract, to tell the truth, but actually gaining a little from its theme - a rarity in itself) is brain-burningly tough, but will be picked up by gamers and kids alike; the friendly theme will be inevitably warmed to. But there's a devilishly tough game of vector mathematics and double-guessing underneath. Beware!

Worth buying the deluxe version or some nice penguin figurines for the finishing touch.

Further Thoughts: Good, yes, but not 9-good. Downgraded to a more realistic 7.

Altogether, that's an abstract game with a pasted on theme, but doesn't matter, because the game is a good filler, and the theme is funny. Makes you think of the Madagascar penguins, doesn't it? 

Set up takes a little too long for a filler, but who cares. At least, it looks nice. Played it only 2p, and imagine that things become pretty chaotic in the best sense with 3 or 4 players.

Was an instant hit with my family, but over time I couldn't get them to play it again, so I eventually sold it. But, to borrow from the old potato chip ad, betcha can't play just once. I like games like this, in which the rules are simple, but the strategy goes deep. It's rightly named one of the 'Top 20 games that adults love to play after the kids go to bed.' The penguin and fish theme is fitted over what's basically a thought-provoking abstract game. The only drawbacks are the set-up time to lay out all the tiles before being able to play, and the basically abstract nature of the game, but to me these are relatively minor points.

A clever 15 minute opener for when you want a thinking game. The main idea is to head off your opponents and cut off islands of tiles that only you can get to and therefore score at your leisure, allowing you then to focus on moving your other penguins and claiming yet more tiles. With no luck in the game, it's all about thinking through moves and countermoves. Thumbs up.

10/29/11 - This game is so misleading with it's cute penguins in candy colors. It lures you into thinking it's a light friendly game and it isn't.

Hey, That's My Fish is a very solid cutthroat game.

I bought this to play with my 4 year old. He's able to follow the game because there is no text to read and the pieces only move in straight lines. But, he really likes trapping my penguins on ice floes more than trying to win the game.

A quick abstract whose worst flaw is setup time.  Each player is trying to move their penguins (pawns) around to try to isolate them on a large fish-filled area.  Of course, there's lots of blocking and screwage.

I consider this a checkers/chess killer.  While not as deep as chess, it's a quick simple, however strategic of moving and blocking your opponents.  It's very accessible and always a lot of fun.

The game's setup is annoying and better with preprinted templates.  Often the setup can take almost as long as the game.

A small gem. Based on simple and brilliant idea, it also has very smart tuning of the game. Hard to believe that it's been made by a non professional game designer.
The more I play it, the more I find it good. Trapping the opponent is the key and there are really many ways to do it. It's difficult to believe that such a simple abstract game wasn't invented before.

RATING: 5
There's a depth to playing here that is more apparent with 2 or 3 players, where moves can be planned out to a certain level. The cost is pretty low and the size is small, and it's definitely engaging for our kids. There is a setup time and the cardboard pieces can be annoying, but the game is nice.

Might be useful to help encourage kids to gain a "feel" for numerical concepts. I'd rather play this than checkers.

Cruel competition of penguins trapping each other while the most cunning one gets the most fish. Rather weird gameplay since the game looks like a children's game.
It sure is quick, but be sure that no player is easily offended. These little penguins tend to sow hatred among players.

Looks like a kids game and kids pick up the rules quickly but don't pick up the strategy very well.  It's actually a nasty little game in terms of making your moves in order to hurt the other players -- strand their penguins on unconnected ice floes.  The most annoying thing is that set-up takes longer than the game.

An abstract with cuteness and cutthroatedness.  I think this would play well with many ages.  I think the moves are simple enough and the game is cute enough that youngsters would enjoy it.  But there is also plenty of cut-you-off and sink-your-iceberg strategy to keep adults interested.  I don't tend to want to play abstracts over and over though, so that's my only limitation.

I have the Dutch, deluxe edition with the cute penguins in it. :)
It is a very simple game, but it really has something to it.  I originally thought it was more of a kid's game, but there is certainly a bit of strategy to think about.  Now, I play it quite often with my husband as well.  Originally, we bought it to play with my niece.  She had outgrown many of the younger games and we needed something to bridge that age gap and keep her interest in gaming.  This has become a favorite filler game.  The game play is entirely different playing with 2 people than 3-4 people.

This is a great game for both experienced gamers and newby gamers.  I have used this as a gateway game for many of my friends who are not into boardgames.  It always goes down a storm and can really bring out the meany in everyone (on more than one occasion an inexperienced player has managed to cut me off in the very early stages of the game).  One bad thing that I have found about this game is that the set up time is a little long considering how short the actual game play is.  Overall this is a fantastic game, suitable for all ages (having played this with both my parents and also with 8 year olds).

I got the "deluxe" version with the penguin figures making fun of each other.

An abstract game with an engaging theme, in which your penguins collect fish that your penguin lands on. The aim is to create gaps which not only isolate a bounty but also limit your opponent penguin's movement. (This isolation element reminds me of Zertz, which I prefer because the player score status is simpler to determine so I get more competitive tension). Interesting as a spatial puzzle, I just can't get excited about it until I want to do the maths and think ahead about optimum moves. I'd imagine a good intro for kids who you want to push later into that horror called Chess.

Too many hungry penguins are around! You have to be quick and get your fish before it goes as a prey to other hungry bird. Make sure that you secure your hunting ground so no one will be able to catch your snakcs, and you will be rewarded with plenty of tasty fish.

Nice family game which suprised me with the number of tactical and planning decisions you have to make. Basicaly it's about dividing a shared area in that way, that my part will bring me more profits.

This is a fun filler game. In this game, players control penguin teams and the objective is to collect maximum fish even as the ice floes on which the penguins are break up.

A 4 player game doesn't take more than 20 minutes and where there is some strategy, there is a good dose of luck stemming from the initial configuration and the starting point where you place your penguins. The game offers a number of "grrr! I wanted that fish" moments justifying the name.

From a non-gamer I showed this to: " At first I thought the sinking tiles were just something that happened, but then I understood that it's something you need to control and react to. This has an extra layer that really makes you think. I hate it."

Take out those last three word and you get an accurate review of this game. At $10, the price is right for this clever filler that impresses.

#6 on personal list "Top 10 games for a new gamer to own"

UPDATE: I have never had a bad session of this game. Approaching my tenth play, there's still more to discover in this thing. Pretty good for a $10 filler.

RATING: N/A
Surprisingly deep given the cartoony art/theme and the overwhelming "this is a children's game" vibe that it gives off. It works at 2p, 3p, and 4p, and can be a bit aggressive when people try to cut one another off. Very confrontational and offers a not-overwhelming amount of lookahead for forward planning. Very quick to explain and takes a play or two to really start to grasp. Good candidate for the always-welcome "let's play again!" 

Nice risk/reward balance between doing a straight Fishgrab versus the more spatial claiming of territory, cutting people off, etc. 

This is my obligatory comment about the setup time: people complain about this as if it takes five minutes to set up and ten to play. It takes a little time to set up, yes, but complaints about the setup time are almost always hyperbole. It takes like 60-90 seconds.

Exellent game with basically no luck involved. Short playtime makes this good game to play while debating which game should be the main star in the same evening. Cute looks hide serious tactical challenge for 2 player. Or truly nasty two or three against one stabbing, if more players are involved. Gets bit repetitive soon for more than 2 players, but short playtime means 2 or 3 games more often than not.

11/08/2007: Played this as a filler game during a recent boardgaming meetup session. Game went pretty quick and it was fun strategizing how best to move my penguins but I felt there there was little else to do in the game.

I enjoy playing this game with my children and my grandchildren.  The concept is simple, yet chess like.  You must think ahead.  First set up the tiles in a square.  Place your penguins (number of penguins dependant upon the number of players).  Players take turns moving their penguin one or more straight spaces picking up the tile the penguin was sitting on prior to movement.  The player with the most fish including the one you're penguin ends on wins

Takes almost more time to set up than to play. Nice little game, perhaps a tad too strategic for newer gamers - I think people can kinda sense how the dryness of the game is covered up by the cutesy theme. Would like to see how this plays with kids.
As long as the players are of like abilities, than this game can play great.  VERY fast, and filled with decisions.
I would probably recommend it to more people as a good family game, except - it is ABSURDLY overpriced!
It is very surprising to me that a simple family-friendly game with some (boring wood) penguins and tiles, and it was priced at $25!
Then they figured that was too cheap (?!) and discontinued that version (which already was so high it turned off many prospective buyers, myself included) and then released the Deluxe version, with plastic penguins, and thought $40 was a pricepoint that people would accept for this kind of game.
And now it's out of print (?) - well, if you can pick up penguin figures somewhere (I'd suggest the Mumble Tumble version of Penguin Pile-Up, or just print out the little circles available here) and print out the tiles, you can try the game out and see if the original is worth that much $ to you.

At $11 this is a very nice cute portable abstract. I am glad that I own it. 
~7/16/12 (after 4 plays)

I sold it. It may be a cute abstract but it is still very abstract. Abstracts are like meals that don't fill you up and don't taste that great but which have a lot of calories. I want the calories (challenging decisions) but I want flavor (enjoyment) and to not be hungry right away (feel like I did something interesting when I am done). 
Hopefully that analogy works...

It's a great game for kids as well.  My 5 year old son can play this game without any problems.  Some complain that the setup is tedious, but it's really not that bad.  I think it only seems long because of how quickly this game plays.  The setup only takes about 2-3 minutes.  Wonderful game!

Players: 2-4
Time: 15 min.

Light strategy game. The "board" is made up of hexagonal pieces of ice flow, with 1-3 fish on each piece. Players move their penguins on the board to claim fish, but each time, the last hexagon they were on is removed. As a result, the playing board disintegrates, and players must be careful not to let their penguins get cut-off from the "(sea-)lion's share" of the fish.

This is the perfect game for game geeks with a wide range of ages to please. It's quick. It's simple enough for smaller kids to grasp the rules. The rules can be explained in less than 1 minute. There's just deep enough strategy to keep the older more sophisticated interested, but even then, the scores will never be totally skewed (although older kids and adults will regularly win due to superior planning and strategy).

RATING: 7.8
Very nice abstract tactical game. Easily plays in under 20 minutes, and often takes longer to set up than to play. Satisfying despite it's short length, this game offers up plenty of tough decisions and provides room for cutthroat play. Also scales very well; the play time doesn't vary much between a 2 player and a 4 player game.

RATING: 6
(Pingvinas edition) Good for non-gamers as it is easy to explain and get started.  Also nice as a family game with a very short (~10 minute) playing time.  Perfect as a game to play while waiting for others to finish.  Shrinking board seems expansive at first, but then becomes very restrictive in surprising ways as the game progresses.

Theme-wise, no one can fault the concept of greedy, iceberg-hopping penguins screaming about their rightful ownership of fish.

Tangentially related to Through the Desert, this game is fast and fun. The play time is shorter than setup time, which is odd; this turns out to be a negative point. On the other hand, almost everyone can tell how the game goes, so the strategy is approachable.

Great fun with kids.

A great filler game for the strategically inclined. Simple and quick to play, but an interesting puzzle to solve. Not game you'd want to play over and over again in an evening, but as that in-between-games game it's a nice alternative to the usual filler games that are luck driven.

Setup can take a bit longer than I would like, given the length of the game, but with a second pair of hands to arrange the hexes it goes by pretty smoothly.

RATING: 8
Played and bought at Essen 2007-10-18.  Very simple elegant pure strategy game with cute theme.  At first we forgot penguins can move more than one space, and it felt like the endgame of Fjordes, and seems fine as a variant!  Then playing it with full mobility made it like Yinsh or Terra Nova.  (I later learned it is similar to the game Amazons, studied by combinatorial game theorists.)  Quite good and plays very quickly.

There is a crazy persistent meme that "it takes as long to set up as to play", but this is nonsense. You're just dealing out rows of tiles! A single person can set it up in less than 2 minutes! (Literally; I've timed it.) If multiple players cooperate to deal out rows simultaneously, then it's even shorter. Anyone who "takes as long to set it up as to play it" is doing something wrong. (E.g. foolishly wasting time dealing the tiles out face down and then turning them all face up afterward, instead of simply dealing them out face up.)

10-05-2015. Rated after 1 play. Fun abstract game, themed around pinguins collecting fish. 

Each turn, you move one of your X (depending on the number of players) pinguins to a tile. You have to move in a straight line though.. and you can't jump over water. Water you say? Every tile you leave, you take out of the grid and score the fish printed on the tile. If your pinguin ever can't move, it's out.

Fun, light, quick. Not much here, but what there is is good and interesting. I liked it a lot.

We were trying to find games our hyperactive 9 year old can play and I think we did very well buying this game.  It played wonderfully the first time.  Everyone had the rules down in about 2 minutes.  We played 3 games in about 45 minutes.  Although this game has very simple mechanics, there is plenty of strategy behind it to keep hardcore gamers happy.  It also plays very well with 2 players, but scales to fit 4 players perfectly.  I am very happy I purchased this game.

It's one of those perfectly harmless games, maybe even fun while you're playing it.

A game that you can teach to a 6 year old that can be played by hard core strategists as well.

Plays best with 2, though is ok with 4.  Don't play with 3, or it becomes a game of often accidental king-making.

Oddly enough, despite the cutesy nature of the game, this is one that is liked by our casual gamers, and by those who would be happy playing nothing but Caylus 8 hours a day.

That for me is the mark of a good game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Perfect knowledge game, very abstract. But because pieces are removed as part of movement, this PK game gets easier to play as the game progresses. Good filler, cute pieces. Marginal set up time for a quick filler.

Penguins hop around ice floes and try to get the most fish. To play, you arrange 60 tiles into a random hexagonal grid, with each face up tile showing 1-3 fish on them. Players take turns placing their 2-4 penguins (depending on # of players), then players take turns moving one penguin. When a penguin moves, you pick up the piece that it started out on, and claim that # of fish. A movement is in a straight line, without jumping over gaps from removed pieces or any other penguins. The game ends when the ownership of the remaining tiles are no longer in contention. Add up your fish to see who's the winner. 

What tends to happen is players vie for the three-fish tiles, which immediately begins to fracture the board. The disappearing tiles create gaps and passageways, and this forces you to make some pretty good decisions for such a light game. Which penguin do I move? Should I block an opponent, or go hop on some big-fish tiles, or can I do both? If I try to fence off an area will I succeed, and will my resulting isolation be a benefit or a hindrance? Nice game. Plays very fast.

My main draw to this game is the time. It does have a relatively high set up to play ratio, but set up, play, and clean up should all be able to be done in 15-20 minutes. The game is very fun and very fast pace. It can be played with all ages, but is in depth enough that I find myself wishing I had moved one more tile or one less after finishing my turn. I highly recommend that this game be added to your collection of "emergency" games that goes with you everywhere. You never know when you'll have that extra twenty minutes to spare at the end of your game night and this game will fill the time perfectly!

This is a game that I really like.  I enjoy the way the board shrinks as the game proceeds.  A lot of the game then becomes positioning your penguins not only where they benefit you, but also hamper your opponents.  This positioning reminds me of train games, which is why I suppose I like it so much.  In some way, this positioning also seems similar to Through the Desert, another game I really like (and don't play enough).  Unfortunately, this game becomes more chaotic as you add more players.  I really think four is too many (as much as I wish it were not).  I need to see about getting some more plays in.  [01/08/2011]

Had to bump-up my rating slightly after discovering I was playing a rule incorrectly (we were putting starting penguins on any tile at the beginning of the game, instead of on the 1-fish tiles).

I enjoy trying to cut-off my opponent(s) in this game by sliding my penguins all over the board like a bunch of rooks/bishops in chess.

Plays well with kids and adults - quick and fun!

Hey! That's My Fish! -- Played once; four-player.  This is really an abstract game.  The theme is established solely through the artwork.  The mechanics are entirely independent from the theme.  While the fun artwork brought some enjoyment to the play, I'm not sure that this wouldn't fare better without the superfluous theme.  In some games, the theme brings a coherence to the rules which makes learning the game easier or playing the game more fun.  In this case, the game gains no such coherence from its theme, so it can't lose any by eliminating the theme and simply using unadorned player tokens along with hexes depicting 1, 2, or 3 pips.  

For example, Ingenious (Einfach Genial) could have used a penguin theme -- Instead it was given handsome components, and it traded theme for style.  I believe Hey! That's My Fish! would do better to follow that model.  

I'm generally not a fan of abstracts, but because this can be learned so readily and it plays so quickly, I'll play it or not, as my group decides. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Playing this a bit more, rating's going up. 

It's a very accessible abstract game (yeah, it's abstract, what else could it be?) - and I love how it is about spatial thinking. Cutting off opponents, grabbing territory for yourself. Playing more, it seems there is more to fish tiles (1,2 or 3 fish) than I'd like to care about, being more focused on areas, but maybe I'll wrap my mind around this. 

The game is simple to explain (for an abstract) and can be quite intuitive to play - I like the notion of moving along lines (not the chess type of moves by patterns)

Takes a while to set up, so get your group involved in it.

Such an adorable game, and also downright mean. 2p games seem to work best since players have more control, and there's a lot more thinking needed for this game than meets the eye. Set-up may take some time, but that's not really a problem for me.

Played the deluxe version. The hefty price tag means that I won't be adding this to my collection anytime soon.

The playing surface is 60 hexagons with one to three fish per hex. Move your penguins along a straight line without hopping over others and you take the tile your penguin started on. Continue until no one has legal moves remaining. Add up your fish, whoever has the most, wins. 

That's it. The box says 20 minutes, but unless you're playing HARD, your games should be over really fast. I would put this on par with For Sale as far as quick, light fillers go.

I would say Hey! That's My Fish almost has a YINSH feel to it because of the straight line movements. I like YINSH, but I love that i now have a 2-4 player abstract filler.

[26 plays] This is a cute game. Good for lighter adult fare, but a 5 year old can grasp the rules. The strategies are deeper than first glance would suggest.

RATING: 8.5
Great, fun filler. Essentially an abstracted area-control game: players move penguins in straight lines across a tiled board and pick up the tile their penguin just vacated. Tiles are worth 1 to 3 VPs.

Once all penguins run out of moves, tiles are scored. Game plays quick, fast and there's lots of room for cutthroat play. It's all about not being caught in the corners and manouevring your penguins to section off a whole part of the board for yourself.

Fun, fun, fun.  Kids love it.  Adults love it.  Basically, trying to grab fish but as each move removes an ice tile, eventually leaving penguins drifting off on tiny floes, the strategic elements are addicting.  Takes as long to set up as to play, however, so have it ready and waiting when guests arrive.

RATING: 6
Trickier than people give it credit for. I feel like it's oddly placed. It looks cute, and the rules are very simple, which is good for children. I taught it to the 10-year-old daughter of one of my cousins, and she seemed to really like it. At least, she kept asking to play. So clearly it works as a family friendly game. 

On the other hand, if you get a bunch of adults to play, it's extremely cut-throat. I had trouble finding people willing to play with Lauren, because I guess it's boring to play it with children ... You absolutely have to go easy on them or it's going to be a bitter experience, and those of us (ie, myself, my sister, and some of my many cousins) that are willing to play boardgames aren't the type to hold back against lesser opponents. 

We played one 4-player with all adults, and it was actually pretty cool. A good filler, I guess, but filler is as much as most of my family has the patience for anyway.

RATING: 6
Supposed to be a kids game, but many kids have trouble understanding the hexagonal movement. The tiles are also a pain in the ass to pick up off the table.

As for the gameplay, has a good amount of strategic depth for a "kids" game. I think that if this game had better components and a re-skin, it would be a more accessible "abstract" game to adults.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] 2-4p, 20m.

Abstract, Area Control. Really enjoyed a couple 2p plays. Not as dry as one would think after reading the simple rules. The theme somehow works for me; one sympathizes with the plight of penguins who become stranded on the ice. Also, allows some surprisingly cut-throat play for a family game. Looking forward to playing this with 3 or 4.

EDIT: I've played some 3p and 4p games now. Dropping rating slightly to an even 7. It's a nice little filler with some tactical play, but would overstay its welcome if played too much, I think.

It's really stunning how competitive and engaging this game is given it can be explained in two minutes. The players control between 2 and 4 penguins and move one of them each round, picking up the tile they moved from. This allows you to block your opponents and in that sense, the game reminds me of Through the Desert, except it scales better. Clever play is required to win the game but take your strategic thinking down a notch and it can also be enjoyed with kids. A solid entry that, at its price, should find space in everyone's collection.

Finally, got to play this light-filler today. We played a full 4-player game twice. It is fun, but I felt it was a little short. Feels a little by checkers, but definitely way more eye-catching.

Played two 4-player games so far, which I really enjoyed. I do like these kind of space-grabbing games (felt like high speed Domaine in the way you are trying to grab a huge icefloe to yourself).
We managed to play at a quite high speed, but I still have concerns about AP. I suspect my friends might be able to play this as well as me, but only by thinking for considerably longer than me.

Once you get the hang of setting it up quickly with the help of a second person this is a nice quick game that is different and interesting enough each time to always be fun. It looks very simple, and certainly the rules are very simple but after a few plays you realize there are interesting choices and tactics that can block other players and you can often move pieces just to trick the other player into moving a certain piece defensively and leaving other spots on the board open.

I picked this game up from the store without reading any reviews. To be honest, it had Penguineeples so I was intrigued. It appears to be a kids game but man....this actually has some deep strategy. My wife and I played two games last night that lasted about 15-20 minutes each. We loved it! It plays great with 2 people. I cannot even imagine with 3 let alone 4 players which would get vicious. A very pleasant surprise and highly recommended.

Very fun, multi-player, well-themed abstract.  It's a very quick game that takes place on an ice floe.  You move one of your three penguins any distance in a straight line.  You then remove the hex tile it was sitting on, claiming the # of fish represented on the hex (1-3).  Game over when no penguin can move.  My only complaint is that it seems to take almost as long to set up as to play.  Much quicker if two people set it up building out from a central line.  Highly recommended.

The kids love this game - ages 5, 7, and 10. It was very easy for them to learn, and not many rules to think about.  For the price, this is a no brainer for family games to own.  And with a little guidance my 5 year old did not completely destroy the play field (the tiles on the table can easily be bumped/moved). :-)  Of course, some of the finer points of strategy needed some explaining (such as blocking), but that was not a drawback. The kids also loved the penguin who is throwing is arms back and yelling because someone took the fish he wanted. They thought that was so funny.

For such a simple game, it's surprisingly competitive. Both myself & my wife like this: the theme is lighthearted, plays very quickly and a soupçon of tactical nous is required to outfox the opposing penguins. Our guess is that with more than two players it'll probably play as more of a dash for fish rather than manoeuvering to block out big scores.

This is a great abstract - Bruno Faidutti's game of the year, in fact! The board is a 7x8 grid of hexagonal pieces (floating ice tiles) with 1, 2, or 3 fish on them (randomly placed). Players get 2, 3, or 4 penguins (for 4, 3, or 2 player games, respectively) and take turns placing them on any 1-fish tiles, then take turns moving a single penguin. When a penguin moves, you take the tile it started on and add it to your score pile. Penguins may move for any distance in one direction to a new empty tile, but cannot jump over other penguins or empty spaces. The game ends when there are no legal moves left (you do get to score the final tile your penguins end up on). Scoring is simple: 1 point per fish. Highest score wins!

VARIANT: If one of your penguins is next to a penguin of another player and there is a hole in the ice in a straight line directly behind the opposing penguin, or that penguin is at the outside edge of the play area, you may move your penguin to that space and push the penguin into the water” (out of game). The ice floe you moved off of STAYS in play.

This is an abstract with a thinly pasted-on theme. But the theme works remarkably well! The pieces are cute, and the game plays very quickly. So despite my general dislike of abstracts, I do enjoy this one

One of the best light, multiplayer abstracts I've played.  Actually, I'm not even sure I can call it an abstract -- the theme works!

In any case, a very solid, interesting, fun game.  The first penguin-themed game I've actually enjoyed, and that's gotta be worth something!

I always apreciate the shrinking board mechanism found here and in other games like Don't Break The Ice.  There's more going on here, but the game still plays out quickly and the penguins look cool.  Good for a quick game when you're waiting for the rest of the group to arrive.

Not a big fan of abstract games so obviously this one is not for me.  It's a fine and well-designed game.  Easy to learn, that plus the theme makes it a great family/kids game.  I don't have kids though so I like games with more meat to them and I'm just not one for abstract puzzle-like games.  This game also plays rather quickly so I'll give it that it is a good time filler.

Kinda cute but a bit too much of a filler to fully convince me. But a good one at that since it does include some strategic planning! I first encountered and enjoyed it online (on yucata), now after having had a live game I have to say that the set up and the removal of the plates is a bit tedious, really prefer the online version. The game is still a good one.

"Light and quick" doesn't necessarily preclude cutthroat play. Children would probably love it with others of similar skill level, but skilled, determined players will focus on cutting off their opponents mercilessly. Piece movement and territory claiming is similar to "Terra Nova", though play is quicker and more chaotic.

This game actually takes A LOT more strategy you'd think. And it only gets a lot more technical the more people you have. This game is pretty fun, the only drawback I see that noone else seems to is it takes kind of a long time to set up for how quick it plays, but then again it doesnt play as fast with 4 players instead of 2.

Stealing fish for fun and profit, does it get any better? A cute theme layered on top of what can be a very nasty abstract has wove it's spell around me. I enjoy analyzing the board to decide where to place my initial penguins, how I might cut my opponent off onto the smallest iceberg. Bearing some similarities to Zertz, the board shrinks in odd ways through the game. Played more lightly, this is a good game for family, being super easy to teach and grasp some strategy. That said, I do have trouble playing it lightly, my wife WON'T play this with me, I "play mean" she says.

Super good game and one of my favorites.  It looks like a cute game about penguins, but it is a nasty vicious game of cutting off your opponents.  It lies in between family games, abstracts and euros.

I think that it is excellent.  The set up time is a little long given the game length, but that is my only criticism.  It is also a good gateway game. You can explain that it is simpler than checkers, which it is, and lure people in.

Given how cheap it is and how good it is, I think all gamers should own it.  Very replayable.

Fast, some AP, since it has quite a bit of "look ahead" involved, and fun.  Easy to learn and teach, plus it really does play in 15 minutes including set-up.  Also this can be played with fairly young players as they will get the mechanic quite easily.  Optimal play might come much later, but if you can 'self-limit' your own down-stream analysis, even young kids will make fun opponents.

Very strategic with 2 players, the player-added chaos will make the game much more tactical and faster as you add players.  Also for playing with kids playing with 3 or more players will flatten out the skill-curve and make the youngsters more competitive.

Of all the games I own, this is one of the fastest to learn (under 2 minutes), yet it has a shocking depth of strategy.  Despite the cutesy name and packaging, this is a game that can most definitely be enjoyed by adults as well as children (in fact, I think they should market an adult-oriented edition that includes a couple of well-chosen words between "My" and "Fish").  Once you realize that it is less about jumping on the 3-fish tiles than about trying to trap your opponent(s)'s penguins, then the game becomes almost Chess-like as you attempt to out-maneuver your opponents and react to their moves (my apologies to the venerable game of Chess for the comparison to the penguin game).  3 players seems to be the ideal number, although 2 works just fine.  With 4, I recommend playing as 2 teams of 2, with both players on a team combining their final score to see which team won.  I just keep wanting to come back to this game with all its simplicity, strategy, and fun.  It has rapidly become my favourite "filler" game, despite the unnecessarily-bitched-about need to spend a few minutes laying out all those hexes for the set-up.  So get over the name and the cartoony look already, and give this one a try!  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

[Phalanx 'Packeis am Pol' 2005 edition] {Abstract, animal; modular-board; scalable} Hey! That's my fish! is a nice family game.  It is also a very good game for children. The design is elegant!  It is easy to learn and teach.  Player interaction is strong.  Fun. No luck.  The game is so short that I won't be bored after a few games.  It's moderately deep and tactical but down time is not strong.  Recommended if you have children.

This is an excellent game for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

[House rule] When placing the initial Penguins, follow this order: the last player places first, then player places in anti-clockwise. After all players have placed the penguins, the start player moves first and follows clockwise. This makes the game more balanced, IMO.

Fantastic little game. Requires no reading comprehension (other than the rules, which can be explained pretty easily) and scales very well with the number of people that it can handle. Makes for some interesting decisions later in the game.

Now that I've gotten to play this with the kids more than a handful of times, my eldest (soon to be 9) is starting to pick up on some of the strategy of the game.
Did discover that we had been playing incorrectly with more than 2 people last night, tho' (we had been using ALL the penguins, ALL the time...).

My only real issue with this is that setup takes nearly as long to do as actually play the game.

This is a great game, but if you are clearly better than your opponent, it will seem too easy and boring.  Its really important that both players understand how this game works to make it challenging.

WOW! I really love this game! Its simple to play and I often play with my children Sam (8) & Sophie (6) who can easily grasp the strategy and will be in with a shout of victory. If there is one thing that bugs me about the game it is that it takes almost as long to set it up as to play it! A minor irritation. All in all agreat game - especially easy to introduce to non gamers - just set it up before they arrive!!

his is one of those games a lot of people rave about so picked up a copy in a trade. It was quite fun, perfect size (including box size) and weight for the game concept. It was a little fiddly in the set-up, which also took longer than you might normally expect from a game at this complexity level. More strategic than you would thing given the theme.

I love this game, and the kids enjoy it too. It has a couple of drawbacks: first, set-up is long and the pieces get jostled during play, and second, the theme is all wrong. Otherwise, wonderful game.

RATING: 7
This games player super quick (10  to 15 mins). Nice and easy with some cool looking wooden penguins and nice hex tiles.  Balancing trying to score the high fish tiles, with keeping yourself from getting cut off means there is a nice bit of abstract strategy involved.

A very good abstract game. Plays fast and very captivating. The only problem preventing this game from being played more often is that it is pretty cumbersome to set up. I will like to play this more often. Will have to go dowload the game board that some BGGers so kindly constructed and upload.

Admittedly there's not much to this.  Rules are very light and easy to grasp, gameplay is fast and gets cut throat.  It's great for all ages and has a fair bit of hidden strategy to the play.  What looks like the obvious choice in the start may become a poor choice leaving you stranded at the end.

07 JUL 2009 - Looks like a kids game, but definitely does NOT require kids. You can play this game with little thought, or you can make it a real brain burner and carefully plan out every move (you CAN, but you probably SHOULDN'T).

Yet another solid game that you can play with the kids and have fun, or even play with no kids and still have a great time.

RATING: 7
I like this small game a lot.  up until recently had apparently been playing it wrong as I always thought you had to move as far as you could until you ran into a space where you could not move further and stopped on that tile rather then moving in a line to a tile in your movement route that you wanted to stop on. 
Makes for a very different game that has a very different strategy to first placement.

I still like keeping the the house rule that the ice slides you until you stop and cannot choose where to stop as well.

This is one of those surprisingly fun fillers that are so valuable in a game collection.  It is fast to play, yet it carries a hidden depth that makes it suitable for just about any group, I would think.  It feels a little bit like deeper abstracts (such as Yinsh), yet it's quick and multi-player.

A small area control game of Penguins moving on an iceberg and scoring fish when they leave a space. I look specifically for games that I can play with my wife and this one fits the bill perfectly. I was told it was simple yet held some great choices to be made, and it does just that. MY wife is not a huge tactician, but there were a few times in our first games that she moved and I had to sit back and rethink my plans, because she trashed the previous set of plans. At one point she even giggled after she cut off one of my penguins and saw that I saw. And she has ASKED to play it. So yes. Simple, but fun. Thank you Fantasy Flight.

RATING: 6.5
This is a very cute game, usually fun for non-gamers or new gamers because of the simple rules and the funny theme (you can play with kids because, "Yay, penguins!", and then you can play with the adults and act out some truly disturbing scenes of back-stabbing and starvation). The set-up is very long for such a short game and can be a little boring if you're not the type for antics or you've only had a beer or two. But it is surprisingly strategic once you give it a chance. If I seem a little back-and-forth on this one, it's because I am; I think it's an "when the mood strikes" thing, but it's so cheap it was worth the purchase.

If the setup was just a little quicker, I'd love it even more.  This is a perfect family game -- the schemers can plot and stab to their heart's content, while the more strategically oblivious can just zoom about the ice.  That said, I've been soundly thrashed by an eight-year-old, so....

It's a fun abstract area control game. I'm not a huge fan of abstract games, but the fun theme of this game helps keep me somewhat interested. It plays very quickly, so I don't bore while playing like I do with many abstract games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've played this both online and in person. The online implementation at Yucata is done quite well, and removes the "fiddliness" found in the setup of the game which is caused by the very small size of the ice floe hexes.

While I believe this is a decent game, it's simply not for me. I believe this was designed to be a quick, fun,"filler" type, but I find it to be AP-inducing when playing in person. A fun enough game, but one I simply have no desire to own at this point.

After just a few plays I can see that I really like this game. It has some similarities to one of my favorite abstracts, Through the Desert, but this game plays much faster.

I don't love abstracts, so this one's doomed from the beginning. I like it for what it is though: a quick-playing, not-overly-thinky, cute abstract. I have the travel edition and it fits nicely on a tray table, so that's a bonus for me and the wife. It's a good abstract for kids too. There's something about penguins hopping around on floating ice, pouncing on fish that makes the kids go crazy for it.

To sum it up: good, abstract, family game. But not my cup of tea.

Nice little abstract with a pleasantly pasted-on theme.  The components are high quality and cute, which adds to the allure for children and non-gamers.  The game itself can become pretty cutthroat as you leave the other player on a tiny iceflow while claiming two-thirds of the board for yourself.  Two dings on the game - 1) it takes a long time to set up for such a short game and 2) the box (while not all that big) is literally four or five times larger than necessary.  I've taken to using it to transport other card games (like Incan Gold, Coloretto, Bang! & Tarot - all at once).

I usually have to be talked into playing this; and I don't know why.  The bits are nice, the game-play is straight-forward, my kids really enjoy it, and I do too when I'm playing.

I played this game half a dozen times with a colleague who bought it for his daughters.  Yes, there is a basic tactical element, and yes it is a good crossover game.  I am not sure to mark it as a adult game is the right thing to do. However, which ever way you look it is a damn site better than playing 'Snakes and Ladders'.  Maybe, to me it was not as satisfying to play as Yinsh, but I was impressed enough to buy it for my children.

Nice, quick and easy game. Great area enclosure game - it is so mean! That was indeed "my" fishes that the others are taking!

It is also so portable and cheap.

The "problem" is that is best to play with people of same level of experience, which can be hard. A noob mistake can simply give the win to someone else - though, the game is quick enough to be played again.

Fantastic. Some of this rating may just be novelty value, but as a light two player game, it is incredibly simple and streamlined. The conflict between collecting valuable tiles and ensuring good penguin placement is nicely balanced. Something of SeaSim in this, I think, but beautifully delivered. A winner!

Rated in terms of fillers.

This game is a simple and short strategy game (fairly abstract) in which your penguins are competing for the most fish by hopping around on ice floes. It is very cute, with great bits and nice art. It takes a minute to learn and not long to finish a game. This has become one of my favorite fillers. It's just so nice and easy.

STOLEN: I left this in the break room at work and someone grabbed it . . . and didn't turn it in to the lost and found. Goodbye, little penguins.

UPDATE: Someone gave me their copy! w00t! I'm very thankful!

Found this game to be pretty fun with a 4 year old at first, but after a few plays it sours...the hex layout combined with the  rule about moving in a straight line doesn't make inherent sense to kids we try to play with. I've never been able to play "all out"--I have to play bad and throw the game. Still think there is an interesting game in there, but this one wasn't for the young crowd, which is what I bought it for.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an extremely small and simple game that offers the potential for a good amount of genuine strategical thinking.  It feels akin to Chess in that you have to think several moves ahead to do well and there are several different moves you can make each turn.  But unlike Chess, it is cute, goes up to 4 players, and plays extremely quickly.  The only slightly annoying part is the setup which takes unusually long for a game this small, but it isn't as bad as some people make it out to be, especially if everyone helps.  I am a big fan of this one.

Stop complaining about the setup time.  It takes a couple of minutes at best - yes the game is short, but exactly how long does Agricola or Puerto Rico take?  Ticket to Ride?  Setup goes quicker if you don't worry about making a regular starting shape/board.  Just make a blob of tiles and go.  

Our 5 year old caught on to the blocking mechanism in just a few games.  A great game to introduce the kids to - you can tone down the agressiveness of your play for a few games until they get the knack. Great fun.

Seriously, don't be put off by the setup time complaints.

Yeeeap. Gud game I suppose. I'm kind of ambivalent towards this one.

But hey, thats just me, its still a gud game!

Can't get enough of this game!  Sometimes we play in three minutes, sometimes it takes us 30.  Either way, it's a strategic, tactical, all-ages wonder!

Excellent filler.  Childishly simple rules, but nice depth of gameplay.  From comments, those who rated this 1-3 were obviously looking for a Civilisation that plays in 10 minutes - good luck to them, muppets.

Yes, its an abstract in disguise, but the disguise lasts about 20 minutes, which is two games, by when other people have turned up to play something else.  

And the penguins are sooo cute!

Reminds me of tron/surround in that you use movement to try and block players from getting points. (When you leave a space, you claim it creating a hole. Lock off sections of the board and you have free reign to all the points therein.)

RATING: 8
OK, light abstract with cool components.

update: rating: 7->8 after more plays. There's definetely more than meets the eye here: the game is about to make your opponent(s) isolated and not about what tile to pick next. You can improve your skill level quite a bit in this game, I believe (which is good). The biggest downside is the setup.

The first question is always; "Why are we playing a kids game?"

I played a two player game of this, and that's how I rated it.  It is a pretty decent game and fairly fast playing, but it has the same problem as most perfect information 2 player games.

This little gem of a filler has much more depth that it seems.  The theme is cutesy, but (like the ice flows you're hopping on)this abstract has about 80% of it's mass beneath the surface.  Its an area-control game with plenty of screwage opportunities where the constantly evolving (and shrinking) board keeps your head on a swivel.  Great game for all ages.

My 3 year old loves playing this with me.  He gets the mechanics, thanks to the ipad version.  His strategy amounts to moving his penguin to the tile with the most fish, which is good enough.

If you're going to choose to participate in this tactile hobby, I say go all in and get the big penguins.

Good fun family game, but most people are right, that it is a pain in the rump to set up, I should have held out and got the bigger box version of it if it is still around, but it was still a lot of fun while playing.

RATING: 7
I would call this a fun light filler game.  I think it plays best with more than 3 players.  For a cutesy theme it can be a vicious little game :devil:  Genre wise it is really an abstract not a Euro.  I would it call it a very well done light abstract.

It is also the first game my son played with correct rules at 4 years old so it is a great game to help kids learn how to play games.

Everyone I have played this with so far have loved it.  Games play quick, and am always asked to play a game or two more immediately after totalling up the scores. 

It's also a game I can teach a six year old in minutes.  A definite plus.

A solid game to play with the kids. The penguins are cute and they like to collect the fish with them. It takes about as long to set up as it does to play because of the number of tiles and the speed of a game.

You pinguin is hungry. You can feed him fish by moving to the next tile (1,2 or 3 fish tiles). Once you step on it, your receive your previous tile that way creating an empty space.

You lose if you can't move anymore

RATING: 9.5
Probably the best filler game we own. It's trivial to learn the rules, but there's enormous tactical depth. Could be taught to and enjoyed by players from 8 to 80. The penguin pieces are adorable.

Is very vicious with two players so don't play if you don't like malicious drowning of penguins.

As much of a classic as Through the Desert.

Any downsides? Laying out the tiles at the beginning is a bit of a pain.

Interesting game with 3 players where there is enough multiplayer chaos for it not to be dry but enough control for your decisions to feel real. A perfect gift were it not for the lame theme.

RATING: N/A
A short (20 minutes) game in which players control a number of penguins. The penguins move over hex-shaped ice tiles with 1, 2 or 3 fish on them. The player takes the hex from where the penguin started his movement from the table, thereby creating a gap which other players can't cross. If a penguin can't move, he's taken from play. The player with the most fish in the end wins. Category: Animals, Abstract Strategy;  Mechanics: Point to Point Movement, Modular Board, Area Enclosure  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game is very simple, but also just challenging enough for its time length.  It also can be played quickly, as a light filler, or more intensely, as you make an effort to plan your moves and trap other players.  It plays out differently based on the number of players in the game (with 2 players, you can save penguins to block certain areas; with 4 players, you don't have enough penguins to try that tactic), but that's not a bad thing.  I can see this being a big hit with families.

Portable version, set up is hell, and removing the tiles isn´t better.

Gave it way to nices, how realy loved it... and was forced into playing it. It's a nice litle filler alright. The flow is good, there is some trouble with it. (Uhmm like geting adults to understand how it's played)

Add 30/8-07: It's getting overplayed, it don't take to so much replay with non kids, as the amount of brain use is way to high.

June 2014 - Well after that I havne't played it. The rating might acctually be low. Also the neices are now a lot older. Like one of them is twenty and working over the summer in Texas. Oh the years goes by quickly.

RATING: 6
This has a fair amount of meanness, for what is at first glance a very simple and abstract children's game. At least it seems like a kid's game when you factor in the silly premise and the cutesy penguins. It can deliver a pretty good brain burn if you let it, but there's not a ton of depth. As someone else around here mentioned, it sort of feels like the Tron motorcycle game; you have to watch your path to stay on the board, while at the same time try to cut your opponents off from their path. Once you have played it a few times, it becomes pretty repetitive, so I'm not sure I even like it as a filler...especially considering the set-up time is kind of a pain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Super light theme application (BGG lists it as abstract).

Move your penguin, take the tile it had just been standing on! That's it! Deceptively simple, but with a great potential for emergent strategy. A brilliant, simple gateway game or low mental-effort filler.

There probably isn't enough in this for long term veterans to keep visiting too often, but I suspect it'll be great to teach my nieces and nephew in a few years as a way to get them into contemporary games.

An abstract game with a penguin theme that kinda fits the mechanics.  The penguins are hilariously cute and play consists of penguins catching fish while ice floe hopping.  Some decent depth, but the game is rather boring; even the kids say so.  Nevertheless, we still do enjoy the occasional play.  Setup is a pain in the ass for as quick a game as this.  Even claiming tiles is difficult without jostling other tiles.

Very light but fun. Downside is that it's probably quicker to play than it is to set up. Also the tiles are a bit fiddly to pick up - a board with gaps between the tiles would rectify this but I don't think I can be bothered to make one for something so light...

RATING: 7
Players reduce the game board as they score points based on the position they move from. Interaction revolves around blocking access to prime scoring tiles and trapping opponents on isolated tiles. 

Movement reminds me of Ricochet Robots but with more control. Very engaging. 

Box is way too big, but it might be fun to combine two sets or create special effect tiles.

"Like Chess and Go,  but I can understand what's going on"

The name is silly,  and I'm still on the fence about the wooden meeples...but this abstract/penguin game is pretty amazing game for a filler.  The only randomness is the board layout - the game itself has no randomness.  There are maybe a handful of rules,  and all of these can be explained in a couple minutes.  But there's plenty of nail-biting strategy,  and it plays easily from 2-4 players.

I would have used cute penguins like the "Don't Wake the Dragon" tuxedo penguins instead of meeple cutouts.  And it's definitely not enough for an entire game night...playing it a couple times in a row might be a bit much.  But you could easily pull it out again in a week - after all,  it's 15 minutes!  How many strategy games fit in a 15 minute slot?!

I have played once with the pushing variant - changes some moves,  but never actually got to see much pushing (you can usually see and avoid possible first-degree pushing situations)

This started off being one of my all-time favorites, mostly because of the theme (yay penguins!). I still like it a lot but have found overtime that I am not as good at it as I could be- I struggle a bit with the strategy component. Don't get me wrong though, I continue to enjoy it nonetheless. I like the variable board set-up, it really suits the game, and I like how fast it is to play. It is also really easy to learn and can be played without strategy too, which is sometimes successful. So overall, I feel that it is a strong game and I enjoy it a lot. It's just not as good a match for me as other games, now that I've been exposed to so many. I would rate it as a 7 for quality, but it gets a 7.5 since I enjoy it so much, despite how bad I am at playing.

Don't let the theme fool you into thinking this is a game for children.  This is actually a remarkably strategic abstract game, cleverly hidden behind a theme that will get even non-gamers interested.  It can get downright cutthroat with skilled players.

Games seldom last more than 10 minutes so you can have numerous plays in a single sitting, and anyone that says it takes longer to set up than play is lying to you; if it takes you more than a minute to set up this game, you're doing something wrong.

I also recommend a nerf dart with a suction cup to pick up the tiles.

I have kind of wanted this game for a while.  I like penguins, and it seemed like a light abstract.  The 1st quick game was interesting, and had some surprises.  but nobody wanted to play after that.  I think it would probably make a good 2 player game.

This is a very interesting little game.  It's a great game for kids, but it will feed their budding gamer.  It really hones their skill in thinking ahead and using positioning.  There is something there for experienced gamers, too.  Can be a decent filler.  I played with my kids within 10 minutes of receiving the game, so it's very user friendly.  The small box version from FFG travels really well, too.  Highly recommend.

After owning this for a few years now, it is a mean and kind of boring game that plays itself halfway through.

This is a great quick game that non-gamers and gamers alike enjoy.  It is for this bridge that I usually break out 'Hey!  That's my Fish!'

A must for parents of children 4 and up.  Have this in your home before a Chess set, Checkers set, or Snakes & Ladders set.  Difficult to imagine a better introduction to board games and abstract strategy.

o Perfect duration.

o Perfectly simple mechanics, and thus very easy to adapt rules and/or handicap for the very youngest. I've played it countless times with 5yo & 8yo; now introducing 2yo.

o The theme is irresistable and fertile for young imaginations.

For adults the game is pretty good, too, though with a board this small play tends to become trivial a few moves after initial placement.

Some reservations about the new and so-called "Deluxe" edition: considering that the original seems to have been discontinued, the "deluxe" tag fails to assuage it's 30% premium.  And I might add that's a pretty hefty surcharge for 16 mass-produced plastic figurines and nothing else whatever: no additional hexes for the adults; no new rule variations or scenarios. Dispite it's simple construction, the original kit probably justified purchase; at this point it's better just to assemble your own set of coasters and figurines from the toy box.

it's a little too childish for me, though it does have some strategy.  with four players, it's very chaotic, and difficult to implement strategies, since every other players can affect it greatly.

This game fits my family perfectly.  It is quick, scales well between 2-4 players, and is a game my younger children can play too.  They win a majority of the time, I might add :)

RATING: 7.5
Easy to learn but carries a little depth. That, plus its theme makes it highly suitable for the family. Game time is a little short relative to its setup time, and the game is on the pricey side. 

The latter concern will be lessened by the 3rd edition, which price is much more affordable. The size of the tiles in the 3rd edition, as well as its artwork, is not as good though.

Great, clever little game... I've enjoyed this immensely both online and face-to-face, with 2, 3 and 4 players. Scales very well, plays quickly, and deceptively nasty gameplay. The rules are very easy to teach, and it often takes only one play to see how everything works together. Plus, it's got penguins! Benefits greatly from a tight online interface at BSW - but even face to face, it's one of the better 15-20 minute strategy games out there.

Fun li'l game. Can be a little cutthroat for a kid's game. Simple mechanics and great components add up to a nice filler. Three player games don't last longer than ten or fifteen minutes and makes for a fun time.

Very good area enclosure game, that while it looks nice and fluffy with its penguins and fish, is actually wickedly cut-throat! This game is not for families that don't like confrontation, because you are constantly messing with each other.

An incredibly simple and easy game to teach that has a deceptive depth to it.  The balance of claiming ice floes with the most number of fishes as well as considering their location must be constantly observed to set yourself up for the next move.  The initial placement of your penguins is probably more important than most people have realized.  I just wish someone could design a board for this that will make setting up much easier as well as less messier.

One of those games I quite like: rules that are easily explained, mechanics that allow (in principle) for very serious, concentrated tactical play, but that, probably because of the 'levity' of the game, aren't actually played that seriously most of the time, but lend themselves more to "casual & fun" (I'd say Abalone is another one of those, but only for two players).
Complexity of this one is a tad on the low side, but there are two big plus points: it can be played with more than 2 players (3 or 4 both work well), and the games are short, but not *too* short. Perfect in-between brain teasing game, or to play with friends and relatives who usually aren't into (board) games.

When this game was originally released, it received very good ratings and even some great reviews explaining game play, etc.  After reading and researching this for a couple months, I decided to add this one to my growing collection.

I would like to point out that I think the components are VERY nice!  The 3-D penguins play into the theme better than the wooden figures and the tiles are nicely illustrated, durable, and easy to handle.

To be completely honest, the game play isn't very fun.  Setting up really takes a toll on players as the actual gameplay is only a fraction of the time it takes to set up the tiles.  This was disappointing and definitely annoying.  I am not a lazy gamer, but I found the setup (per instructions) to be such a downer!

When it comes to playing the game, sure it is fun... for the first few rounds.  Then, everything becomes VERY redundant and dull.  

Children will a blast playing this game and I would highly recommend it.  As far as adults go, your money would be better spent on something else.

Good game, since it is brainy (makes you think) but also good and sweet looking (for the kids, ladies and non-gamers)

Really shines with two players, if you are careful not to choose an AP opponent.

With 4 players, it is better to play a series of games (4 or 8 so everybody plays first), and then sum up the scores.

I'd mentioned it to my son in passing and he actually asked for it for Christmas .. an opportunity I wasn't going to miss.

This is about as simple as it gets but can be great fun. My son doesn't like much confrontation but with this he really gets into the fun of it. Its so quick to play that its not really a huge deal when someone deliberatly cuts off your penguins from the best fish. Its so obviously a valid tactic that everyone does it and theres never any hard feelings.

The only down side, and I'm clutching at straws, is that it can take longer to lay out the tiles than to play! For that reason alone we'll limit ourselves to maybe 3 games in a sitting so it doesn't get tedious but its a fantastic intro game to get everyone into a competative and fun frame of mind.

Skilled players will win. My dad, in his first 3 games, wupped us mercilessly. But he's played a lot of chess and draughts and is good at seeing patterns and planning his own and other moves well in advance.

I would probably rate this higher if it didn't have the penguin theme pasted on. Gameplay is also too simplistic and one dimensional.

The 2 player game of H!TMF is not going to go down in the annals of zurupeto's favorite games.  I don't know why it didn't tickle me, I guess I felt it was sort of a 1-trick pony that couldn't hold my interest.  3 or 4 player games might be better; I don't know.

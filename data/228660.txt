GAME: Betrayal at Baldur's Gate
RANK: 1619
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Never played the original Betrayal, but this re-theme drew me in right away. I'm always excited to play this one, though it can be a bit steep if you're introducing new players and they're lucky enough to become the traitor. Also... the traitor often has a very strong advantage. This is especially true in lower player count games.

I got to play this game once. The designers really learned from all their design bumps in Betrayal at House on the Hill. Everything is smoothed out. And because all the characters have special abilities you actually feel unique and empowered, rather than just some human.

RATING: 1
First phase of the game is multi-player solitaire and very random.  With so many games with so much player interaction vs. this sit and wait it instantly lowers rating to to 6.  Then randomly one player is selected as the betrayer, down to a 5.  Then it was completely imbalanced and after 1-2 rounds of the "real" part of the game it was clearly over and the next 30m was just finishing the job, 2.  Very poor D&D theme'ing, just adding some fantasy characters to this extremely boring dungeon crawler, 1.  

I feel there is a fundamental problem with trying to fit D&D into a board game.  This one is a very poor execution of that.  Struggles from some horrible imbalance issues and "secret" rules that end up make any strategic thinking completely pointless.

A total dice rolling randomfest.  No thanks.

I'm sure there are much better D&D games (D&D 5e, Tyrants of Underdark, Waterdeep).  I'm sure there are much better dungeon crawlers (Descent, etc).  Not sure why anyone would want to play this when all the others are so much better.

RATING: 2.1
Was very much hoping BaBG improved on the original, but yep it's still nonsense. 

The good: can be fun if you're looking for something that doesn't require paying much attention, interaction, or strategic thought. I guess it's fine if you're looking to just kill some time to take your mind off rising sea levels and solar flares. Maybe if you're just really into D&D lore but even the "Minsk & Boo were here" graffito didn't get me there. 

The bad: see above. Most of the game consists of wandering aimlessly, with no interaction or any strategy beyond trying to draw cards at random and hope they're good for you and not bad. The haunting phase (usually an hour or so into the game) finally creates some tension but in my experience the conclusion is rarely close: most games are a blowout one way or another. Also commits the cardinal sin of early player elimination.

Changes from the original: unique player abilities add a little spice. Otherwise, seems pretty similar.

Just as fun as Betrayal at House on the Hill. The switch up Haunt rolls makes sure you get at least 3 omens before triggering a haunt. The D&D theme is a definite plus, but that's my bias.

RATING: 7
Initial Impression: After my first game I can confidently say that this game feels very much like a retheme of Betrayal at House on the Hill. Please refer to my comments from that game as they all pertain to this one. Personally, I was a little disappointed that the publishers didn't even bother for a clean retheme. The Omens and Haunts  are still referred to as Omens and Haunts. Personally, I feel that the game works a little better as a horror than as a fantasy theme. Either way, it's an enjoyable, light game that I would play but not too often.

We found the component quality to be pretty good overall, but some elements of the game are a bit flimsy. The minis are painted, which is a big plus.

Gameplay-wise, this game is a bit of a mixed bag. Our 3-player games have been uniformly disappointing. The randomness of the gameplay is definitely better suited for 4+ players, so play it with bigger groups, if possible. Also, the rulebook is pretty difficult to navigate when looking up rules on the fly. There's a lot to remember, so that can quickly become problematic.

All in all, Betrayal at Baldur's Gate, while an improvement over House on the Hill, is an unspectacular game that's best suited for larger groups. However, if you love DnD and horror games, then there really isn't anything better out there.

D&D themed Betrayal at House on the Hill. 
Not that there’s anything bad with this statement but: gameplay-wise, there’s very little to differentiate this from the original.

I rate this lower than the original because I prefer the classic horror theme over this D&D quasi-horror theme.

Enjoyed this more than Betrayal at House on the Hill since this one felt like it ran faster and smoother. However it is to much move and draw a card to get a good RPG-feel but there is to many descriptions and texts to read to make it fully feel like the quick and easily accessible boardgame it could be.
Ok and I can play it but nothing that catches my interest much.

The changed haunt roll makes game length more consistent, although the roll itself provides less tension.

Slightly better than Betrayal at House on the Hill. The fact that you don't have to roll to get things, instead just drawing from a deck, is an improvement. 

Player elimination is still a problem that can't be overcome by slightly better mechanics and a theme I'm more interested in.

My one play to date I was the betrayer and I won, yet I'm still uninterested in playing again.

RATING: 8
Plays much faster than the original in my experience.  I enjoy the retheme, but personally, I miss the B-horror movie theme, which is too bad because I thought DnD was a good opportunity for roleplay-lite but they seem to have opted for making the game faster/more hectic.  

I like the fact that I can actually get a game done in an hour now, but I actually kind of miss the longer gameplay personally.  Also, this version seems less broken than the original.  However, the original was broken in both directions, whereas in this version it seems very hard for the betrayer to win.

But I need to play more, and I want to play it again soon!

I like dungeon crawlers and co-op games but this one feels so random. The map is random, the goals are random, the combat is random, who becomes the traitor is random. 

I know I oversimplified things and certain rooms  (like omen type) are more likely to appear in catacombs than in the streets. But that's how the game feels to me. Random. Not my favorite  game but it's short enough that I wouldn't necessarily turn a game of it down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very similar experience to the original, but even faster. Like in the first Betrayal, some haunts are unbalanced and are highly dependent on the position of the tiles, which can lead to crushing defeats. If you liked the original, you are going to like this.

RATING: 6.7
Rating a 10 temporarily to offset the irresponsible people who rated the game a 1 because player count is 3+. Really? Ratings should reflect the actual gameplay, not a personal preference for player count. I mean, the game has been 3+ players since 2004...is it really unexpected?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The slight tweaks to the basic Betrayal formula are mostly successful at balancing and polishing a system that has really begun to show its age. I was sorely missing a Swords and Sorcery game in my collection, and the theme here is well enough applied and integrated to do the trick. My favorite aspect of this new version of Betrayal is the more unique characters, each with their own ability and decent enough mini. It is definitely easier to stat-hoard in this version, which seems to be an intentional choice and works thematically, but there also seems to be less variety of items, omens and tiles (that might just be because the my last few plays with BaHotH included the expansion) and now there are essentially two floors instead of three, with the door way indicating whether you are going to building, street or catacomb tile. That's okay I suppose. Each tile is much more richly designed than in BaHotH, which is great for individual tiles, but muddies the overall layout of the board. The haunts I've had so far have not been particularly interesting, but it is hard to judge on that so early. If I come across anything amazing (good or bad), I'll update this post. In general, you will likely have a similar feeling about this game as you do about BaHotH, and your preference will likely come down to theme. Though this new version is the mechanically more solid game, it also is less charming, coming out in a much more competitive market. There are other games that do many of the same things but better, but you can currently get this for 35 bucks, which I would say is money well spent if you like this sort of thing. Seven stunned monster tokens out of ten.

While it adds some nice gameplay improvements to Betrayal at House on the Hill, the scenario writing felt lazy and uninspired given the them. Of the few scenarios I've looked at they were all pretty generic and didn't actually resolve. I basically felt like the scenario was, "The bad guys want to get this thing to this room for unspecified reasons. It's up to you to stop them by getting the thing to this other room and not doing anything that would actually stop the bad guys from getting the thing back." Then when we finished the game, the victory text was basically, "You did it, congratulations!" I know I haven't seen most of the scenarios, but when I look at 3 scenarios, (1 I played, and 2 played by the other people) and they all boil down to the same thing, I don't have much hope that the other scenarios are going to be any better.

Hopefully they take more time to improve the writing on a future reprint, but for now I'll stick with House on the Hill despite preferring the theme and improvements in Baldur's Gate.

I was sceptic about this game, but it isn't just a reskin and new scenarios. In here instead of constructing the floors of a building, you can build the sorroundings of the starting tavern from building and street tiles. The haunt roll also changed, and the characters are much more buffed, compared to the original. I say it's a fine alternative of bahoth.

This is exactly what you get when you cross Betrayal at House on the Hill with DnD.
Good: There are a lot of quality of life improvements. You get items more frequently and characters have abilities so the characters are balanced and interesting.
Bad:  My immersion was damaged by the random drawing of tiles making the city feel like an abandoned amusement park. Some of the haunts tell the betrayer to just kill the other players with out much else to do.
Bottom Line: I feel that this edition isn't as good as HoH but still fantastic. Definitely play it. I would say get this one if you either really like DnD and/or you've already played out HoH and Widow's Walk expansion and want more.

I was hoping this would expand upon Betrayal at House on the Hill formula and update the game with more modern mechanics. Instead this is pretty much a clone of BaHotH but feels even more disjointed. 

Good: 
DnD/Fantasy theme is one that is more appealing to me over a haunted house.

Bad: 
Locations make absolutely no sense in this game. Where two oddly adjacent rooms in a haunted house could be due to the haunted nature of the house it just doesn't work for the DnD theme. They could have had a more robust system to ensure you don't have nonsensical locations next to each other but they didn't, this is amplified by the encounters being one size fits all, so you can have slimes or other critters roaming the streets or hiding in closets at the inn. 

The DnD theme is pasted on. 

The haunts are still unbalanced and bring gameplay to a screeching halt when triggered. 

Note: Because this is a clone I think you only need one of the Betrayal games. So I would stick with House on the Hill because the theme is slightly more entertaining and believable.

Solid re-implementation of Betrayal at House on the Hill. Unfortunately not much has changed from the first game. In many ways, this feels like BaHotH 1.5.

I'll be keeping both, as sometimes this theme is more up my alley, though I personally prefer the original slightly.

Betrayal at Baldur's Gate takes what was a really solid game (Betrayal at House on the Hill) and improves upon it. If you're a D&D fan you'll really love all of the improvements, but you don't need to be one to enjoy the game.  None of the haunts I've played overstayed their welcome and there have been a few where there was either no traitor or no traitor at the beginning, which was new and interesting to my game group. Love the game and I think my group will end up playing it a lot.

Theme integration is a bit odd but I do love both of these IPs.  Unique powers for investigators is great, most rules changes are good.  The component quality is still pretty lacking, the cardboard quality is poor and black and white art on the tokens is lazy considering they own all that art in color already.  But hey, the clips on the characters are seemingly better so that's a thing.

RATING: 9
It feels cleaner than the original Betrayal, of which I am a huge fan. I credit this to the different tile piles and the rule reminders (on the tiles, player aid, and rulebook, which is remarkably brief).

The character abilities are VERY fun. They help to immerse your player character into the fantasy world, by giving them traits which are distinct, interesting, and applicable. 

The events, items, and omens are also enjoyable as they reinforce the theme. We were particularly impressed with the vibrant colors of these cards, which helped significantly in determining how many omens were out (for the Haunt roll).

Overall, it's a fulfilling experience which has the clear hallmarks of a game which has been years in the making. It is by far my favorite rendition of the Betrayal series as far as mechanics are concerned.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After one play, and despite the original Betrayal being one of my absolute favorites, the jury is still very much out on this one.

After the piece of crap release that was the Widows Walk expansion, this is very much a “try before buy” game. In fact, I will be “trying a few times before buying” anything from this team.

RATING: 6
Betrayal at Baldur's Gate is a refinement of the game Betrayal at House on the Hill, but this time rethemed to the Dungeons & Dragons universe.  As in the original, players take on roles, move around to discover new tiles, and draw cards to improve stats, until at some point the haunt occurs.  Then, a specific scenario is chosen based upon the circumstances, and one player acts as the traitor and tries to compete against the other players using scenario-specific mechanisms and objectives.  This game doesn't have the same component issues (the plastic tabs actually stay attached), and introduces special powers for characters instead of just variable stats.  I'm sure the scenarios are more balanced too, but I can't say for sure.  On the whole though, it's really the same game.  If you like one, you'll like the other.

Very similar to the earlier Betrayal game but slight improvements that make the game a bit better. We have not played all of the scenarios but the one's we have played seem a bit more difficult but certainly better organized.

More Betrayal at House on the Hill, but D&D themed. Same problems as Betrayal, it's an experience generator, just don't expect to win because you're 'good at games'.

Better theme than haunted house. Good for storytelling, and a usually different experience every time. The characters all have interesting powers to choose from. Two levels, with street vs building, and then catacombs.

It's still Betrayal, with all the usual flaws. The Balder's Gate theme is worth exploring for a couple plays, perhaps, if you're a die hard D&D fan.

RATING: 7.5
So, if you've played Betrayal at House on the Hill, then you've played this. It's just a re-skin as far as game play it concerned. It seems like the player stats cards for tracking your levels is better and less likely to move and get bumped. There's obviously a whole new set of possible haunt endings. The one we had was good and the game was fun. It's just not really my typically type of game to play. To really have this game shine, you'd likely need to enjoy dungeon crawls and add in your own stories and a bit of character role playing.

I like the exploration and the coop at the end. Would like to play this more, but needs a group.

Aside form some superficial theming, it's really not any different from the original.  The haunts are a bit more balanced in favor of the heroes and a bit more likely to be fully cooperative.  But it is still a period of undirected randomness followed by an actual game which is sometimes wildly imbalanced, sometimes ambiguously defined, but sometime really quite fun.  Very much hit or miss.

I like the use of this game concept in the Baldur's Gate world and the artwork is quite nice! The component quality is a bit meh, the first edition Betrayal was quite a bit better. The scenario we played was quickly over and we won easily, but Betrayal has learned me not to judge a game on just one scenario

I loved the original and love this re-skin ed edition even more! Best played with an experienced group of gamers, but Im always up for a game. Components are a bit lacking with card thickness dissapointing a bit and custom card size making an exact sleeve fit a hassle.

Hard to rate because every play is so different (and some just don't work out well).  Certainly a quite unique game (ignoring that it is a re-theme).  The haunts I've played have utilized the D&D world well.

Out of 4 games I feel it's more mechanically solid than the original Betrayal, maybe a hair easier, but not by much. It's far less possible to trigger a Haunt on turn 1, and the haunts seem to be well balanced. The game is a little more generous with items, but I feel this is a good thing because in the original you could trigger a haunt without any items drawn and then the haunt would require 2 specific items. The fact every character has a special ability (one for both sides, 12 total) is also a great touch.

It's pretty much the same game play experience as Betrayal at House on the Hill with a Dungeons and Dragons theme.  If you liked the first one, you'll like this.  If you didn't you won't like this.

Fun game where no one knows the traitor until the haunt is triggered.
Good number of unique characters for a variety of playstyles.
Sometimes feels like the villain is at a decent disadvantage.
"Procedurally" generated board is different every playthrough.

Plays almost exactly like it's predecessor (Betrayal at House on the Hill) with the exception that it played almost as if it was rushed out without each scenario being play tested. 
A perfect example of an issue we had was our first play through. Three adventurers had to play haunt scenario 15, the one with the Kobolds. The objective of the traitor was to get six of his kobolds into the mansion while the other two adventurers set traps to kill or stun them. It came down to one stunned kobold and the traitor decided to use his Whispering Skull to move the kobold one more space into the mansion, winning the game for the traitor. The other adventurer and I quickly argued that since the kobold was stunned, it shouldn't be able to move. We consulted the rulebook and even though it had card clarifications for several other ones, it didn't specify whether or not a stunned monster can be moved with an omen card. We ended up voting the traitor down but it would have been nice to find an official ruling for that situation.

Enjoy the theme, the gameplay and the randomness (at least when the dice always hate you) However, the rules could have been done much better and the components were not the best quality. This game will probably make it to the table rather often despite the downfalls

I think enjoyment can really vary depending on how the haunt plays out (aka the game can be really unbalanced). Unfortunately on our first play through the haunt dragged on FOREVER and eventually some of the players ended up intentionally bringing about their own demises out of frustration. It's been a bit of a hard sell after that but will definitely reassess once we've managed more play throughs.

What Betrayal at House on the Hill should have been the first time around. The character powers make the games feel a lot more interesting. It's still a lot of the same though. Also, the terminology and card labeling are all the same, which doesn't really fit with the theme.

Our fist official board game was the original Betrayal and adding a DnD theme only made it better. Hoping for an expansion because the content is pretty predictable after a couple plays.(item, events, and omen cards)

The graphic design is strictly worse than [i]House on the Hill[/i]. The dark brown palette makes it difficult to discern important details such as stairs, sewer grates, and tile entrances.  These really need to pop, and they don't.

Characters now have powers, such as the dwarf adding extra dice to combat (for a price).  And some of these powers you don't want to see attached to a traitor.

The new "inverted" haunt roll (one die per omen, haunt triggers on 6+) means that the haunt won't trigger too early, but the reverse is also true: a late haunt is similarly unlikely, meaning that that the board and characters might not develop as much as they could.

I miss the multi-level tiles. Now the same rooms appear on the same floors (building, street, catacombs) - and there seem to be fewer tiles?  So less variety?  And I personally prefer the horror theme to the D&D theme.

Unfortunately, our inaugural haunt was rudimentary: kill the traitor while avoiding his dull minions.  I one-shotted our enemy with my frenzied dwarf (10 dice for a net 7 damage) without issue.

The conclusion: There's no reason to own this if you own the original, particularly if you expanded with Widows's Walk - which already adds more haunts to the scare menu.  But [i]Baldur's Gate[/i] is still worth playing occasionally, so encourage your neighbor or gaming buddy to invest.

(rating assumes you don't own the original and prefer the new theme)

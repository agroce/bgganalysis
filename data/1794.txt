Really like the wide open map in this one.  With the possible exception of Italy, there's no where to hide.  Have to manage your front line very, very well and conserve your forces carefully.  Has Mission Risk cards that are all tough to accomplish.  Advanced rules are very hard to understand in English; can't make heads or tails of them.

Dans Risk, les joueurs tentent de conquérir des territoires et de faire avancer leurs armées. Plus les armées sont importantes, plus la chance de gagner augmente. Des objectifs secrets sont là pour pimenter le jeu.

IMO this game is a much improved version of the basic risk game. The Advance Rules add some new twists and game play.

A lovely game both for Risk and Napoleonic wargaming fans, especially those from Risk. Enjoy when you own. A good sharing time with pals. One point deduced for its rarity and less publicity - a French style ?

Much too expenisve this one, but I bought this because I wanted a better Risk. And it is. There are some new rules (some I don't really understand because they're in French), and the map of Europe gives the game also a new spirit. I'd rather put all my armies in Scandinavia than in Australia for instance. Won't be played that much I fear because German style games are just better and shorter.

LE Risk à avoir ! Cette version n'est sortie qu'en français et est désormais introuvable, sauf d'occasion.
J'ai eu la chance de dénicher cette perle sur LeBonCoin.fr pour 15€ (le 4/11/2014). Truc de ouf !
Bon jeu !

Que dire du risk Napoléon ? Vive l'empereur !!! Les guerres de napo au niveau stratégique, en toute simplicité. Il faut de la chance (et des dés), mais tous les grands généraux ont besoin de chance non ? Et puis si l'on a pas de chance, il reste la diplomatie pour convaincre les autres que celui qui vous a battu est trèèès dangereux (hop plan machiavélique, hop manoeuvre,...et après hop hop, conquête de la Russie, et puis...).

Advanced rules: An improved version of Risk with a few additions to the rules (fleets, which never came out in my game, generals & fortifications for example).  At it's heart it's still Risk, you still role a bunch of dice but it's more difficult to run the board.  The Secret Missions keep the game from lasting forever, especially if everyone's keeping the leader-of-the-minute at check.  The mission cards might be unbalanced depending on the circumstances of the game... maybe drawing two cards would help as some people are just going to have a  very difficult time winning.  Haven't tried the historical variant yet.

A twist of the original formula: new map (that I love because of how everything is connected and you're never safe), a set of advanced rules (I like the general, the recruitment and the fortress but not the ships) and a campaign (that I've never played because the spanish translation is not well made and to me it looks like some players will be almost idle half the game). I recommend this one over the vanilla Risk

Para mí el mejor Risk. Si bien este es un juego que queda anticuado y obsoleto en cuanto has probado unos cuantos eurogames. Risk dura demasiado para el infinito azar que tb tiene. No está mal pa jugarlo alguna vez, en plan homenaje casi.

Risk with a map of Europe and a few generals.  A few special rules, but still a game of luck for the most part.  Definitely not a wargamers game.  Beer and pretzels with this one please, but keep them off of the pretty game components!

Elegant artistic board is a beauty to see. Rules from original French. Basically Napoleons campaigns reduced to RISK play with added features of forts, ships, Generals and special cards representing Napoleon, Wellington and Blucher.
Scenario rules seperate campaigns and countries involved. I bought this from a guy who picked up several copies in France. I was lucky to get it.

We played this game through from 10pm to 2am with the advanced rules & some historical addition as a starter. The game is well researched & plays very realistically. Either playing a winning or losing side, this game has very good appeal. The fleet rules are a little complicated at first, but give the game a good strategic element.

Rating is for HC only. See standard Risk for ratings of play as ordinary Risk. [See review.]

The Historical Campaign [see my light review which just introduces the game] seems to me most appealing. It recreates the whole of the Napoleonic wars in a series of rounds with VPs and goals for each nation. It plays pretty well as just ordinary or slightly modified Risk too but the HC just seems I richer deeper game to me.

There are a few omissions in the rules of the HC but I have written up and submitted a file on this.

See reviews.

This is a really interesting game.  I would say it is the best "Risk" game by far given the historical backdrop.  However, it is still a "Risk" game.  (You can play it like a regular Risk, or Mission Risk game.)  Don't confuse this with something like Napoleon in Europe or La Guerre de l'Empereur.  At the same time, the linked historical scenarios are a pretty impressive conversion.  It might make an ideal game to help introduce current Risk fans to more complex historical games.  The English rules are so well done the French just adds even more theme, if you don't speak it!  Highly recommended.

For some reason I like this better than Hansa, even though Hansa has more tactical decision points and is less luck driven.  For me Paris Paris is just overall a better formula for a light family game.  A solid offering.

A very interesting design, but I'm not sure about it yet.  I dig that you are fighting over short and long-term scoring opportunities, but it didn't seem exciting.  And the graphics are as bland as they come.  But...it was short...like 20-25 minutes.  The decisions are not that brain-busting.

The game works as a game, but how much fun to play is up for grabs.  I played one game with my wife that came down to one fought-over point, yet it still lacked tension.  The mechanic listed in the database description is "point-to-point movement," but I would call this a very light introduction to area control or worker placement (particularly in how you leverage locations combinations to substantially boost points).  I also think it would make a pleasant tool to teach children a little Parisian geography, especially exciting if played shortly before visiting Paris.  It is more fun to play this game quickly by gut feeling because it is too simple to really enjoy optimizing each play.  In sum: a good stepping stone to help children develop towards playing more interesting Euro-style games.

Only a run through by myself - seems incredibly dull. Looks dull with its ghastly 90's designed board in pale purples(!), plays dull with it's arbitrary theme tacked on a non too exciting abstract mechanic. At least it comes with a draw pouch and wooden house tokens that can be used for other games. Just wish the houses weren't painted purple(!) and grey(!)

This is a light, fast strategy game. I don't feel it is constrained on your choice of move. The first player has a lot of choice to place their shop, but he is also disadvantaged since the next player has more advantage (can break the previous's network). There is a lot of deep strategy in this game, a lot of choices. Fun and light.

RATING: 7
Light 30 minute filler.  There is a fair amount of luck involved with 4 players as you need the right destination turn up at the right time so that you get to pick it when it's your turn.  A 7 rating is probabally the best it will do due to this.

It seems like a family oriented game.  Very fast and quick.  Decisions look simple yet there is more to it than meets the eye.  Don't rate this game until you've played it more than 5 times and can consistently beat the best on BSW.  Otherwise, you'll end up rating it low and not realizing that you've made a alpha I error.

You build tourist shops in one corner, and bus takes tourists where no-one has built. A principally nice game, but I feel the constructing and breaking of shop chains is too random compared to their scoring.

RATING: 7
michael schacht's stock is really rising for me.  i won't say this is thematic.  it's more like it casts a pleasant, thematic breeze over the game and i think it's a good model for stepping up an abstract.  the rules are medium for a game of this technical weight, but once they're assimilated the turns can flow pretty easily.  works very well with 2.  so far the strategy rather than tactics seem difficult to visualize.  it will take many more plays to decide if this is because there is less control than it seems.  a later playing with 4 was still fun, but i think it's better with less.  still fairly with the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At the heart of this game is strategy and planning.  Its theme is arbitrary except for the dependancy on the map of paris that dictates the possible connections.  The designers did a very good job of picking the possible routes from the Paris streets., but it is clear that the routes could exist in almost any city.  Visually, the game benefits from the map theme more than one would expect.  Since game play is fairly quick, this game fills a nice quick serious filler role nicely.  [GTI Code: APSD]

RATING: 4
I tend to like Michael Schacht designs but this one just doesn't cut it for me. Generally speaking, luck of the draw is simply too much of a factor, especially in a 4 player game. Yes, there are some interesting, tough choices to be made at times but typically  there is an obvious move. I'll acknowledge I don't mind playing it as a 2-player as you can play several games in row but even then, I think I'd rather play Lost Cities because of the tougher decisions throughout gameplay. For 3 or 4 players, I'll pick Web of Power over this everytime.

I picked this up in a trade partly because of a mechanic or two that looked interesting.  After reading the rules, I was unimpressed and expected the game to fall very flat.  Well, it's not a great game but certainly better than I expected.  I played with 3 players and was crushed, but I can see the importance of positioning and, especially scoring the correct routes on grand tours.  I'd have to play again to see if it holds up, but the first play was actually pretty decent.  It's an abstract with pasted on theme, but I think works for what it is.

Great game!  Despite the speed of the game (and this could be considered a downfall by some) there are some tough choices as scoring happens in 3 ways (small tours, large tours, end of game tours) - and there are opportunities for defensive and aggressive play.  Frequently the choice is deciding who needs the points the least out of your opponents (in multiplayer).  The mechanic whereby the person who had the most shops removed from the board scores them as a bonus is a clever way to thwart 'leader-bashing' which is prevalent in the game.

A really great little game that should keep even die-hard gamers happy as a light change of pace.  A clean, elegant system.  Nice balance of luck and strategy...perfect for this type of game.  Defense is as significant as offense.  Limiting your opponents&#039; score is often more important than maximizing your own (although the game itself keeps leader bashing to a reasonable level).  A lot to like here.  Schacht is starting to become a favorite designer of mine.

Schacht rocks, and I LOVE the city of Paris, so any game utilizing a fun old-style map of the City of Lights is OK by me! Like Hansa, a very dry tactical exercise--this one creeps up on you. First few turns you think nothing's happening. Suddenly about turn four or five BLAMMO! Your choices are suddenly both agonizing and absolutely critical! Sweet.

RATING: 6
Enjoyable light, but not mindless, game.  Very good with three.  I think the people who say that the game is boring because you always take the tile that scores you the most points are playing suboptimally.  I find it more important to play so that you build a more stable network, even if that means you forgo some points early on.  Surviving so that you score a good number points during the grand tours at the end of the game is more important than getting a few extra points early on.

I think there's a really cool commerce game to be had with the ideas presented herein... businesses on tourist routes through a classical city... but this game is only okay.  One play and I have had enough of this iteration of the theme, and the strategies are too simple to really develop over the whole of a game.  Okay as a quick filler, but I wish there was a more interesting and deep game that approached this subject matter.

Pretty weak. Not much in the way of interesting choices, no game tension, not much control. Similar to Kardinal &amp; Konig/Web of Power in feel, but not as good IMHO (and I didn&#039;t care much for the previous game either). Very dry too. Fun factor is completely absent. Little in the way of strategy that isn&#039;t fairly obvious on one playing.

Another Schacht delight. While I doubt it will achieve the status of Hansa in my book, the scoring mechanic is fresh and interesting. The tradeoffs between going after the intersections versus going after the less travelled stops reminds me a lot of the tradeoffs in Hansa - drop a market to gain influence or use one up to gain VPs and lose influence. Totally different mechanic, same feel.

Fun game which I plan to aquire. Easy to learn. Quick to play. The game involves choosing which locations on bus routes to place you markers and collecting points as buses pass by. You choose your location by picking a tile from a group of tiles that are randomly turned over. One more tile is turned over than players. The points are then scored by players with markers on or closest to the location tile that was not chosen. The major scoring involves when buses run along one of the entire bus routes of which there are 5. I'm not sure the strategy boils down to much more than just picking the best location which is almost always one of the main intersections crossed by two bus routes. I had a lot of fun with this game but I'm not sure it will have staying power.

RATING: 2
A completely shallow and uninteresting design. Any decisions of significance are obvious, so the game contains absolutely no tension at all. The winner boils down whomever retains more of their houses (luck) and keeps control of the key stations (more luck), as the mechanism for compensating removed pieces is badly broken.

RATING: 5
Production: The components are durable enough, but the business colors are not as distinguishable from each other as they could be, and the board could be both prettier and less convoluted (my vote would be in favor of a more cartoonish map).  The tiles are functional and durable.

Play: Clever use of a counterintuitive mechanism, where I must avoid picking a tile, if I want that tile to score.  The choices are very few, so players must optimize their business placement.  I enjoy this more with two than with three; with two players I find it easier and quicker to assess the relative merits of taking each tile.  I'm not sure what a strategy should be, but there are fun decisions each turn to maximize one's score. (1+1+3) (3 plays)

Michael Schacht excels at the 30-45 minute boardgame and this is another example of such.  Players open businesses on bus routes and score points when the bus routes "hit" or when there is a tour along a route.  Very elegant to play, a little bit of luck, but at 30 minutes it's not a big issue.

Played once with 3, found it really dry and unintuitive.  The board layout is really confusing; the theme gets in the way rather than enhancing the game.

[1 play] Clever little game set in modern Paris.

So I'm hoping to play again soon.  I foresee this game being a moderate like that gets kept around for the sake of the theme.  Any game set in Paris is automatically better.

Reminds me why I don't especially like Paris (those loud tourists, those tour buses, those overpriced cafes) even though I love rural France.  Still, I'll return just to go to Berthillon and Mariage Freres again.

As far as the game goes...it doesn't do much for me.  There doesn't seem to be much long-term strategy, because it's too easy for other players to dislodge your buildings.  Usually you just have to take whatever will give you the most points in the short term.

Great little game especially if you like Paris. Like the placement and addidtive scoring mechanism.  Some turn decisions feel really tough and other times not.  So it hits a lighter weight niche for me.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this in its mechanisms, but it seemed to have more luck than control. Getting ownership of adjacent junctions is the way to big points, but I was concentrating on getting the single spots next to junctions and scored half the points of the winner. Technically, there's a good deal here to interest gamers, but the game left me feeling vaguely disatisfied. I still enjoyed it, though it may get marked down on successive plays.

Played 1 time. Well that was a disappintment! Ultra abstract depsite a good idea for a theme. In the "post-game", the teacher, Patrick, pointed out that the board is actually a grid disguised as a map of Paris which made me mad at the game. =) Don't think I'll play this again. Clans and Cartagena already fit the bill...

RATING: 7
A light family game with a twist to help those who constantly get picked on.  You know like that older brother we all love to target with each possible nasty trick; well in this game, he gets his revenge as the shops in the bag eventually score for the most picked on victim.  Utterly inappropriate but well thought regardless.

RATING: 6
  The constant scoring is mildly annoying, but I'm getting used to it.  Love the colors and the look of the game, it is unique.  We drew the tiles out of a bag to avoid making stacks, it shortens setup time.  I'm a big fan of the Schacht games I've played and am hoping Paris Paris will be a good two player one.  

Update:  A fun game, but you have to do lots of scoring.

[Route connection, Tile drafting] [4P:7, 3P:7, 2P:6] Strange little Schacht game. Has the requisite streak of chaos and randomness, but there's a few quirks in the system that make it just a bit interesting for a couple of plays. However, the lack of depth makes the title suffer, and it's not even as good as the mediocre KUK. Nothing I'd want to go back to. *** UPDATE: Hey, I was wrong. I guess it takes a different set of players, who are willing to be vicious and calculating. Paris^2, played as a lightweight tactical game (yes, with a bit of luck), is a pretty nice palate-cleanser without the fluff of the usual fillers. There's a largish bit of luck in the game end Grand Tours, but let's see how we can fix that with a house rule. (Looks like Mike did it himself. See the BGG links.) Schacht delivered this one, almost under my nose. I'll have to give China a look now, at the very least.

This little game is growing on me. At first I was some what on the fence, but with more plays now I am really beginning to enjoy this quick area control offering.  I believe you need three or four to play, as two just never seems to capture this games potential.  Definetly a lighter game, but it makes a wonderful introduction to euro-games, or as a quick opener with some real decisions.

UPDATE: I am not sure why this Michael Schacht title has found appeal with me, but I enjoy the pace of this title in pairing with it's level of depth.  Something about Paris Paris seems just right when I play it.    Something about this game fills a needed hole in my collection, and provides fun to boot.

I tend to like Schacht's stuff, but this one is beyond terrible.  There are almost no difficult decisions.  If you can get a middle stop, take it, otherwise see which stop will either build your (highly fragile) network or will cause the bus to run and get you points.  It all comes down to which stops happen to come up when you are the first player of the round.  There's some very interesting ideas in here, but it just doesn't come together into a meaningful game.  The randomness kills it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not a bad game at all.  It's not as up there as say Web of Power or Hansa, but this game is still worth checking out I think.  It's take a little while getting used to placing your businesses and doing what you can to start or prevent a Grand Tour.  Some nice choices in the game, especially since you don't want to beat up on one person too much, otherwise they might get a nice little 5 point bonus at the end of the game.  In our game, 5 points would have changed the outcome completely.  I am not a fan of the board, since it can be hard to read, and also the scoring track is too small.

As a fan of Web of Power, I really like this one.  The turn order tile selection mechanic gives you a different set of decisions each turn, and the "displaced businesses go in the bag" effect makes you think carefully about ganging up on the leader too aggressively.  5 minutes to learn, 40 minutes to play.  Great!

Augh. Parsing and juggling multiple (prospective) scoring procedures that change with yours and everyone else's every move. Choices seem almost obvious with 2, almost random with 4. Much as I want to like this, it feels as if it's won through the mistakes of others rather than cleverness of one's own. It should be realized that overbuilding does not work as a straightforward bash-the-leader mechanic since at most one player will get points back: the one that was overbuilt the most. As an aside, this is hidden but very trackable and trackworthy information.

Only played against bots. Interestingly, I consistely win against a single bot and consistently lose against several; usually multiplayer chaos tends to work in the opposite direction. Surely they aren't colluding?

A lot more abstract than I thought, and the wooden pieces are not all that attractive. But, as a 2-player, anyway, it is a decent game that I think gets a bad rap.

But for secret-color-guessing games, I prefer the goofier Drunter und Druber or (especially) Familienbande.

Paris Paris is a very enjoyable boardgame. The game-mechanic itself is extraordinary which makes this game even better. Rules are very simple and one game doesn't take a lot of time which is always a good thing - still Paris Paris offers a lot of fun and  little brainwork too. Only negative aspect in the game is, that the gameboard and used components are quite colorless. But the game itself works! 
Updated: after many-many games it's still fun, but there is a quite high luck-factor which why it's impossible to play well in every single game. But that don't bothers me.

Interesting placement game which plays very quickly and builds towards a tense and satisfying conclusion as the number of houses on the board makes the endgame significantly more interesting (and important for scoring) than the early turns.  Often one is faced with difficult decisions about whether to make the more advantageous long term placement or the short term scoring bonus.  I enjoy the fact that the game is set in Paris, a favorite city of mine, despite the basically abstract, themeless nature of the game.

RATING: 7.5
After second game upgraded from 6 to 7.5

As we started and we felt our way into the game it appeared to be quite a gentle and enjoyable family game.  However, once scoring started it quickly emerged that certain points were key and the game suddenly turned cutthroat taking on an entirely new character. 

The lack of different routes (please ignore the pun) to victory, your choices dictated by turn order and not much real substance to the game meant I did not feel any great attachment to the game.  However, I would play again with the knowledge that I have to roll-up my sleeves and appreciate that I am in a straight shoot-out for high scores rather than an immersive gaming experience.

Second play got into the spirit of the game. Enjoyed more now I know its a one-dimensional headdown charge up the scoreboard. 

P.S. An additional note is that at the time of writing the game is nearly 10 years old and did feel slightly dated.  Hard to pinpoint why but others around the table commented on this.

RATING: 6
Something of an underestimated game, in my opinion, probably because it really is a chaotic mess with four or five players.  With three, the tile draw and station selection comes under control, and the game starts to so it's quality.  As a two-player game, PP actually starts to shine a bit, with light but interesting decisions.

Because of the math and the difficulty of tracking what scores when, this is definitely a gamer's lightweight, not a game to try and hook non-gamers with, but it fills the role rather nicely under the right circumstances.

UPDATE: haven't played in quite a while, and haven't missed it, so I guess I should call this a 6 now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A little dry, a touch abstract. It is occasionally difficult to see where the bus stops are on each bus line, making it easy to miss adjacent stops when scoring, or to add in a stop which appears adjacent at a glance but is really 2 stops away.

Clever mechanisms and fast play give this one an edge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Never let any comments or reviews convince you that this is a non-game. There is future planning despite the short term benefits of some decisions. The only wrinkle, and the one I won by, was that of the removed businesses. I'm sure you could track that information, but in a game this light why should you have to, and more to the point why should a close game be decided by such an arbitrary mechanism. 

The game is light, fast, and some what of a light deduction experience. Purchased cheaply and played briskly I suppose it is worth it but it fits the same time frame as Chine or Web of Power. I can see the origins of both of those games here, but given that I own them I would default to them.

Kind of unusual Schacht game. It grew on me a little, and it definitely has that Schacht feel, short and deeper than it first appears.  It's a little bit random, but it ain't hurting anybody.  It could do with some improved art, though.  Not sure about the color scheme.

Each round, place a business at a location, then a small tour comes through generating money for locations of businesses. Grand tour at the end of the game. I've played this enough times to like it, but strategy wise, I think all one can do is optmize their play (boot someone out of a station, score small tours) and hope things work out. Much like Web of Power, this one is light, with some appearance of some strategy. Neat idea at the end of the game to reward the one with the most removed stations points.

RATING: 6.5
Quick and light.  More abstract than the board would have you think, but has just enough decision-making elements to make it worth playing.  It's nowhere near as good as Web of Power, the author's 'other' influence-and-connections-game, but I'd still recommend it to those who want a decent opener or who can look past the sometimes dry gameplay.  Plays much better with two than with four players, IMO; three players is okay.
Downgraded rating slightly after further play.  The game is just too chaotic with four players.

The kids and I played a couple of 3 player games and had a lot of fun. The rules seem complicated (just reading them), but once you start &quot;playing them out&quot; you see how simple the game rules are. The aspect of the &quot;secret&quot; color and the use of the &quot;blind bag&quot; to award additional points (after the board play is over) add a nice touch. But the blind bag is not a blind as it seems. Since each player has 19 &quot;business markers&quot; and can only play one marker each round, it is pretty easy to figure out how many of each marker are in the bag. In our games, the bag awarded 6 points to a player each game we played. After more play (especially a 2 player game) I may change this rating.

A solid typical "7".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a quiet game as the bus stop tiles are turned over and players evaluate the various scoring opportunities. Once you grasp the two scoring concepts, it&#039;s a case of evaluating the worth of the turned over tiles as well as the consequences of the unused tile. At least this info is open to all so evaluation is more simultaneous rather than being turn based so pace is good. Game play fits theme well and its good to learn the locations and reminisce about Parisian suburbs. Best with at least 3 as this introduces the black bag for deposed businesses, a linen &quot;castillo&quot; which scores for most (so maybe reducing the intent to depose) which adds a nice tension of uncertainty at game end, thought there is doubt how uncertain the quantity of businesses in the bag. This element of consideration is added to the memory element of determining what tile locations are left, though speculation is helped by placed houses reminding you what tiles were drawn previously, so long as you can remember the exchanges. Scoring can be a little confusing when you consider adjacent businesses. Just a little quiet and mathematical for my taste. Also found bus tile choosing situations imposes a kingmaker attitude. Feels a little like Clans and I&#039;m suspecting the latter maybe better.

A game of almost no decision making. Put your brain on autopilot. This is a one-strategy game: always place your pices on intersections. The final result is determined by luck and meta gaming factor.

Several plays and still not sure we're playing it 'smart'.  Scores are so close during the game that the final 'bag' score may often be decisive. Hopefully there's more strategy/tactics to this game than I've been able to bring to it; it just may be me though....

This could go up to a 7, time will tell.

A nice light game, by the way scoring is handled you have some tough choices. Block and opponent trying to make a big score, go for one yourself. Force a grand tour before others are ready. While Paris Paris has simple rules you have a lot of options on how to play

Connection game on a board with a very small number of nodes with a drafting element. 

Pros: Fast-moving fluff. I prefer it over Hansa (which has way too much downtime). Very tactical -- limited options on your turn. Sneaky plays possible as players control when scoring occurs.

Cons: not very strategic. A little too long for fluff: interim scoring throughout the game slightly bogs the game down (I believe fluff should have as little bookkeeping as possible) and mechanics get repetitive.

Perhaps not quite enough here to match it with Schact's better games. Very speedy game play and enough to satisfy most gamers, but doesn't really break out of its limited, ultra-light mechanic. If it were food, it would be a waffle.

Whenever I try playing this game, I tend to think I haven't learned the rules properly. The mechanics are strange, enough to cause a nagging feeling of confusion throughout.

Sure there&#039;s a basic strategy in there - good things to do and what not to do, but in the end it&#039;s just a big luck fest. There&#039;s little opportunity to defend your placements when you&#039;re not the first in turn order, or when multiple cities come up that you should defend. You can adjust your strategy accordingly, but luck is still luck and there&#039;s too much of it in this game to really rate it as anything more than a very ordinary game indeed.

Interesting game where you hope to place your bus stops in places such that Lady Luck will smile the sweetest at you when she arrives. But scoring is a little too weird. And there's quite a bit of luck; you can only do the best with what luck has given you, and no more. Also weird in that with 2 players, there is more luck in the tile-draw and more strategy in picking which tile to draft, but with more players, there is less luck in the tile-draw, yet less strategy in drafting the tile. I'd rather the designer just focus on minimizing luck and maximizing strategy for just one player complement.

Paris Paris -- I've seen criticism that the decisions are too obvious, so play is mechanical.  I think that's too harsh.  The decisions lack agony, and they're rather limited, but they do affect subsequent play.  I find the game balanced and quite fun.

RATING: 6
Seems easy to learn and relatively quick to play... Place your businesses at various points on bus routes to score. Definitely go for the middle multi-junction places for better scoring opportunities.

The Good: Scales well from 2 to 4 players. Quick and usually close scoring games.

The Bad: Board quite dull looking. Game can feel a bit samey after a few plays.

2015 UPDATE: Looks like this one could be heading for the exit, as friends and family just can't get into this one. Bit of a shame, but I'm gonna need the space... eventually :P

RATING: 8
Because it is essentially a territory control game (a la El Grande or Web of Power) stripped of any bells and whistles (the bus route intersections and the cool scoring mechanisms provide the all of the complexity), I assumed it would be  quite dry.  However, the few games I&#039;ve played have been very fun and tense, one reason being that the scores throughout the game can fluctuate wildly, but not chaotically, if that makes any sense.  It&#039;s also nice to see a medium to small game look so great.  My guess after limited experience is that it is ideal for three players.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
There is a strategy to this game, but sadly there is only one strategy.  You are always going to take the tile that will give you the most points.  It would be like turning over a tile that says 4/6/9  if you qualify for the nine points you will take that tile to get the nine point.  It doesn&#039;t need any players the game plays itself.  YAWN!

After witnessing all the brickbats rained down upon this game by the BGG community-at-large, I was a bit surprised at how much I liked it.  To figure out what was going on, I went back to reexamine the main lines of criticism: too tactical, too much luck, too dry and mathy.  Well, I prefer tactical to strategic games, I don't mind a healthy dose of luck, and I was a math major once upon a time, so that's fine too.  Mystery solved!

I like the theme (transit in Paris), especially that you are rewarded for building a network, and the hidden endgame (you know one line that will have a major tour and the possibility of scoring a few extra points from the sack).  However, your set of choices are a bit limited and the amount of luck too high to elevate this above an occasional play as a lighter game/filler.

I've only played this game twice so far with 2 and 3 players.  The 3 player game seemed more satisfying.  There was more interaction and it I enjoyed the the extra guessing factor of the 'black bag'.

Oddly, the 2 player game saw both of us running out of houses (businesses) by the 2nd to last turn.  I couldn't find what to do in this case, so I guess I'd have to mark this one as an asterisk game.  :)

It's a family game with some interaction but maybe too much randomness. It makes players feel that they could be in control of something but I guess we're not controling anything. I've only played it once and with two players so I have to give it another try with more players before deciding its rating.

It plays quickly and it has some good things. Strategy can be a bit blasted by luck or by what the other players do but in the end it's a not bad, bad game.

This is basically a network game.  Each round 4 players choose from a set of 5 randomly selected set of nodes (street intersections) to play on, the unchosen 5th determines which nodes score that round.  It's a clever game that plays fast.  The game's color choices are a bit odd.  For instance, grey and clear are too similar.

Only played once but really enjoyed this fast-paced game.  Every turn you are torn between building your routes for future points, gaining a quick point now, or preventing an opponent from scoring.  And who doesn't like to drive the bus along its many scoring routes?  Ahh, Paris in the spring time...  The colors of the bits and board are very hard to make out in dim cafe lighting which is a shame because the map of Paris attracts people to come by and look.  The route lines should have been thicker to make them easier to follow.  The poor production quality takes away from a game that has a lot of fun built into a short amount of time.

Michael Schacht discovered Paris Paris while developing Hansa, then carved it off as a seperate, lighter game.  Frankly, I think Paris Paris is better.

when this game first came out on brettspielwelt i played it several times and enjoyed it very much - the mechanics are very fun and there was a feeling of 'more than meets the eye' to the game.  however, with repeated plays, the game's lack of real decisions has come glaringly to the fore. firstly, it is possible by chance or minimal effort of his opponents for one player to get completely hosed if his houses are removed too often. this is NOT remedied by the bonus for most removed houses. secondly, it is nearly useless to try and set up a winning structure because one's houses can so easily be removed - especially in the important spots. thus the best move is basically to choose the best individual spot, without much if any planning ahead. in essence, this game is fairly deterministic as far as player decisions go, and where's the fun in that?

Michael Schacht; Every year, millions of tourists visit Paris and the many attractions the city has to offer. To the joy of the Parisian business owners – represented by the players – the tourists leave a substantial amount of their vacation money in the Cafés, Bistros, and Souvenir shops. There are five tour bus operators that offer different routes. The places where the most successful tour buses stop are great places to open businesses that cater to tourists. Then the next time the tour comes by, the owners can reap big rewards for their investments. Point to Point Movement

Much of the game is out of your control, thanks to the tile draw and the ability to replace existing businesses along the routes, but the backwards-logic of the game appeals to me.  I like route-planning games, but this one has a higher element of Take That! to it, meaning it might lose its sheen over time.  I really need to play this one again to see how it holds up.

Maybe be because I only played it twice, but this is not a very outstanding game. Light and fast... good at the end of an evening, but too difficult to play with non casual gamers.
Good in it's category as light end of the day game, but there are better ones in that genre.

Very enjoyable game. 
Many people say that Michael Schacht's games are repetitive, i.e. you keep doing the same thing throughout the game without any change in strategy. And it's pretty much true of Paris Paris -- but what you keep doing is fun enough and a game from start to finish is short enough for the whole thing to be more than worth it.

Making connections, and claiming property.  There are some great decision making points where one has to decide on future or immeadiate reward.  (And future reward isn't always guaranteed.)

Again, this is a game I probably will never own, as my wife doesn't care for spatial relationships.

Tokens control intersections on the bus lines.
Easy and quick.  
One of my favorite light games that is just fun.

RATING: 5
This game consists of players working to build tourist shops along bus routes.  Whenever the shops get visited, players get points.  You have to be careful balancing long term strategy and short term scoring.  The colors of the wooden pieces are a little hard to distinguish.

Fairly light and dry, but I am enjoying it for what it is. Plays fast and works for 3 and 4, (haven't tried with two). Three better than four I think, (due to only three routes scoring at the end).

Now that i totally understand the scoring possibilities in this game, I've been at least a little taken by it. It's not as good as KUK, but the same weight.

The Parisians had better hope this game doesn't get popular, or they'll experience a dramatic downturn in tourism.  Visiting central France should be a sensory explosion, not a visit to the dental chair.

Hard to describe. Quick and easy but there is some strategy.

Played on BSW only. I imagine the numerous scoring phases would  make the real game quite long. Unfortunately, most decisions in that game are easy, mainly because of the perfect symmetry of the board.

A solid game. I could see myself introducing this to younger players.

Ugly game with AP.  Nice box.

It seems like there are a lot of decisions to make when choosing tiles, but the only strategy that really works is protecting your position on major intersections. So the game comes down to which player draws the tiles you need.

RATING: 6
Quick and fun, without being too taxing on the brain.  I don't think the choices are as obvious as everyone makes them out to be, as you can trigger tours throughout the course of the game depending on what you choose.  There's more than meets the eye, in other words.

RATING: 8
While the rules seem complicated at first it only takes a couple of turns to get into the swing of the game. Delightfully simple, a decent balance of strategy and luck make Paris Paris a great, quick game. As an added bonus it's fun to reminisce about our trip to Paris by tracing our travels on the detailed map.

Build the best tourist traps in Paris to catch the tourists on their tour bus rides.

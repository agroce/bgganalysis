Very enjoyable, maybe medium weight, family game.  Lot of randomness can surprise you, but as the designer says, it's about managing risk.  Excellent theme and even a bit of a history lesson.  My family likes it, so I do too!

This game is the perfect example of a game with great ideas and a very well implemented theme but surprisingly when you play, Blockade Runner stays a little flat in choices and the game lasts too long for such little deep.

It's a beautiful looking game and it has all needed for being a great game... but strangely it isn't.

I prefer Popular Front from the same designer.

RATING: 6
High risk transport game. Interesting feel
as you watch the confederacy collapsing (in
part due to your own selfishness), and the 
job gets harder.

Weird part is that the rewards for success decrease
as the game moves toward completion.

Component issues (smokestacks) make this damned near 
unplayable though.

After playing opposed, I find the risk element is
even more fun than I suspected, AND I found a smokestack
solution (wet paper).

RATING: 3
Not sure why this game is rated so highly initially (play testers?).   Our group found this game incredibly tedious, and threads suggesting this game was at all similar to "Brass" are so off the mark that it's not funny.

This is not, in anyone's even wildest imaginations, a euro game or a euro crossover game.   Its turns and pacing are like that of a wargame.   It is slow, has a lot of downtime, and the decisions aren't incredibly interesting.

The decision to have a player make all of his turns at once (rather than one at a time around the table) is incredibly odd, because it results in players having turns that are 10+ minutes long, and that's not doing much thinking.   Since everything changes every time you move, other players CANNOT plan ahead.  They must just sit there, and then when it's their turns feel all stressed out about having to try to do things quickly.

The production is also pretty awful.  There are typos in big bold text printed on the board ("defense" and "defence" appear right next to each other, for example), and the little flag thingies don't at all fit in the boats, making for aggravation.

Perhaps this game has a very niche audience (history buffs perhaps who are fine with sitting around a table and talking about the civil war for hours, for example).

But avoid if you are a euro gamer with little interest in the history.  In fact, even war gamers will likely want to avoid too.

Blockade Runner belongs not with wargames or euros, but in the rare genre of economic simulation.  This does with dollars what wargames do with bullets... model a historic event with attention to realism and detail.  Blockade Runner shows you the whole Anaconda from the prey's perspective.  Big downtime and fiddly components mean it won't hit the table often, but I will always look forward to it.  Like Chrononauts, this will be a game I think about a lot more than I actually play.

RATING: 3
Good try, but way too fiddly, too long, and the luck in the game is too swingy and not nuanced enough. Definitely some good ideas here, and the theme is ripe for an interesting game of this sort, but but this just has all the failings of a newbie designer and publisher: bad rules, unclear cards, playing time that's too long by at least 50%, too fiddly. I really like what Numbskull Games is trying to do, but I hope they can pull it together.

RATING: 9
This is another fun, Euro-style game that uses the American Civil War blockade runners, who ferried goods back and forth between the Confederate ports and nearby neutral islands like Bermuda, Cuba & Puerto Rico to attempt to continue antebellum trade between the South and Britain, Europe, and South America.

This game plays well and developed smoothly from its original design.  There is enough variety, suspense (the land war & blockade impacting the blockade runners' plans), the planning & movement of goods, taking risks to get the better payoff while you flee the Union Navy, and cards & random events.

Choices you make regarding whether to traffic in the profitable Cotton and contraband goods vs. whether to leave space on the return voyage for 'war supplies'.  The latter gives far less profit (you can attempt at auction to buy newer / bigger / faster boats with your profits) but can slow down the Union advance, whereas going for large short-term profits will creat a mess for everyone.  But only one player can win, so make your plans, roll your dice and seek the better part of valor on the seas!

Great subject wanted to really like the game.  Several of our group were really bummed out, they quit, when the Runner got sunk.  Would suggest a house rule that just damages the Runner with a payment penalty to repair and losing your load.  Will attempt to play again with our house rule.  If it works then might give it an 8.5.  Really great looking game that works well, mostly.

Could not get passed the rulebook. Completely unclear. Thankfully the other games I've played from this publisher do not have this problem, or I would probably have stayed away if this was my first exposure to them. It's possible there is a good game in here, but after reading about some of the balance issues... I never felt the desire to try and sift through the rulebook again.

my first look at a pick up and deliver with a combat element...well, let's be honest, it's more about running and surviving combat while gathering cash as fast as you can.

RATING: 6.75
Rating based upon two, two player games.  I would like to play this with more but suspect four players is probably the tops to maintain interest and ensure turns proceed reasonably quickly. I was initially concerned about the dice on the actual running but you can try and stack the odds in your favour, and you don't have to run.  Much more debilitating is the random placement of the High Seas Squadron - if its repeatedly in the same place and it affects you, then you will be struggling.  Some tactical quicks in the two player game seem to have become apparant (i.e. things not to do, to avoid giving the game to your opponent) but I need to play more before I regard them as caveat. Shame about the ships/funnels problem, and rulebook can occassionally be a bit vague.

I like Civil War games, mostly they are all war games, so this is refreshing.  The theme is well represented by the play and actually makes you feel like Rhet Butler!  The play is extremely tight and unforgiving, but the risks can be minimized by the card play.  Too bad the smokestacks didn't fit  or I would rate 10. Note: the Numbskull company replaced my smokestacks!

RATING: 4
A reasonably good mix of risk management and adapting to a changing map. Played with 3 players. I think it needs at least 4. I also don't like how each player takes all his actions at once. It should be split up more so there is less down time for each player. Many of the port locations were never utilized, this may change with more players. The theme is excellent, the map is nice. The pegs in the boats don't fit at all and were quite distracting, a big production blunder but it is a new publisher so I can cut them some slack. The other components are all good.

Update: after posting my comment and rating I was contacted by Patrick Stevens thanking me for the rating/comment and informing me that replacement smoke stacks are available. Customer service is hugely important to me and to have a gave developer contact me unsolicited with this information is greatly appreciated. I don't even own the game! I am increasing rating by 0.5 for the improved smoke stacks and the above and beyond customer service.

A good game if not played too competitively.  A bad roll can completely ruin your chances of victory.  However, a good game that keeps things up in the air until the end.

I do have some problems with the situation as is.  The Black Market goods getting really cheap in the end game doesn't really make sense with history, as does the general slowness of the Union inland advances.

I was a play tester so take it from there.  Good economic game with interesting decisions and fast play.  Rich historical theme is covered throughout the components.  A very interesting set of dynamics keeps flow smooth and pointed in the direction that players choose. While player interaction is prominent, individual choices are not usually a personal issue like in many multi-player games.  The deals that can be made are the part I like the most. Coercion is always fun, and I like to see people squirm and beg.

RATING: 7.5
Wow, after 1 play, this is a really neat game. Definitely a significant luck factor: As with the other Numbskull Games game I've played, Last of the Independents, the random element is concentrated into a few very-high-stakes moments. But the theme really comes through with this one. Just really different, in a good way. Good to read here on BGG that the component issue with the smokestacks is limited to the first print run and that they will replace them for you.

RATING: 4
I should preface my rating by admitting that I am not the target audience for a game like this.  I definitely appreciate the historical flavor and attention to detail that the game offers.  I can also see why the game has its fans - it gets trickier as the game goes on to balance profits and safety.  But I can't really see myself ever playing this again.  Downtime was the biggest problem, as players' turns just lasted too long.  It was also difficult to plan too heavily for your own turn when a lot of things could change during the turns taken by your opponents.  The components are definitely problematic as well - the little pegs that are supposed to go in the ships did not function at all and we just had to try and remember which ships were ours.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
An economic growth game with no working mechanisms for catching up if you fall behind.  And falling behind is far too easy - I lost two out of three ships when the ports that I was in became blockaded and I rolled poorly. The leader in the last round lost because he lost a ship and valuable cargo to another unlucky dice roll.  This sort of thing might have been acceptable in the 1970s but not in 2011.  Poor rules and bits that do not fit together are also unacceptable.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First play was rough.  Numbskull rules are always a bit terse, and this is a case where the rules were bouncing off my brain more than usual.

Once we figured out the rules, the analysis and action point style of the game caused for a slow event with lots of down time for the players.

The game is also fiddley.  Lots of cubes.  The smoke stacks fall off the ships too easily, and the clutter on the board with charts akimbo - it just made for a somewhat unruly scene.

I like the idea of the game, more than I liked my first play.  I would play again, but it's not a game I need to own and control when I might next play.

Impulse buy at FLGS.  The theme grabbed me and I took a flyer on this one with no background info at all.  Can't remember the last time I did that.  Components look quite good for a small publisher and the attention to historical detail appears to be superior for economic Euros of this sort.  I have very high hopes for this one.  Will rate and review once I get a chance to play it.

RATING: 6
It is a good game for multiplayers. A simple wargame - Euroish but thematic. Players join in the game for running the Southern smugglers out of the Union blockade for commodities like tobacco, cotton, war and black market goods (no one is defining what black market goods but you go figure the trick here).  

The Union North placed an embargo on the Confederate South by blockading the ports on the Gulf an Atlantic regions. To survive the war, which requires supply of the arms from the offshore ports in Bermuda, Bahama, Haiti, Cuba and finally Matamoros in Mexico, the South was to export the commodities in return to support the war economy. Prices of the commodities will drop when the "commodity boxes" are filled up, representing a decrease in the demand of the commodities. If none was delivered in a year (mostly because an effective blockade along the coasts, resulting in a longer distance for the ships to travel to unload the stuffs on the offshore ports), the prices will go up two spaces. Otherwise, they will go up one space at the end of each yearly turn.

Each player is dealt randomly 3 ship cards (2 small and 1 large) and compete to profit from this smuggler trade, while avoiding the Union blockade with the help of the port defense and the speed of the ship. The port defense is built up from level 1 with the use of port defense fund, accumulated through the play of action card (4 each players) at $5,000 each ($10,000 if the card is discarded). The ship is individually rated with different size and speed. The larger the ship, the smaller the cargo in each ship convoy and the slower its speed to get through the Union blockade. For example, my "Dominion" was lost in the first turn (!) when I rolled two dices and both of which exceeded the value of 6 after the calculation: Speed of the ship + port defense + cards played - union blockade level. The speed of the ship also determines the number of sea area a ship can travel in one turn on the map. The number of ports being blockaded by the Union is determined by the War Efforts Chart, which is generally depending on the amount of war goods being delivered to the Southern mainland.

Overall, a simple but very effective and artful game mechanic to simulate the Southern war economy aptly.  The components conveys a strong sense of the years back in 1861. The game map is hard-mounted, shaded in light old yellow for distant memory. The cards are illustrated with plain sketches of ship captain, torpedo boats, ironclads, ports and cities etc. Ships counters (with the little funnel on each) are pictured with the historical painting of the actual ships. So when you play the game, you really feel that you are operating the ships in a war, one that which is severe to test mankind's will to survive.  Selling goods and stuffs via black market merchant sounds like more professional than a pirate..... A Euroish wargame at its very own that every one is quick to pick up the mechanic and then focus on the mini-max strategy.  On the minus side, the rules are constructed in no manner like a wargame one and the flow within the rules takes me some time to cross reference here and there.

A very thematic game, with mechanism that really make you feel like an investor who is running blockade runners. BUT the game is too long (and I like game that are long) for what it offers and it is way to luck-based. The downtimes are too long and the components are of bad quality (the map is sturdy and very good, but the rest....) Also has some very basic design flaws (rules and arrows on the war effort chart)

RATING: 4.75
The basic game is ok, but it is doing the same thing over and over five times, and whoever manages to roll better and not have cards drawn that block you can win.  There are some seriously overpowered cards in that deck.  Essentially the actions you choose each turn are pretty much the same.  Interesting try, but not a favorite.

The map is absolutely fantastic.  The components are a minor problem (smokestacks don't fit out of the box, fiddly ships and cubes don't 'transport' fluidly).  The idea is great, the execution maybe not so much.  The player aid is more clear on some rules than the rulebook itself and some of the optional rules are essential.  FAQ is a must.   Company support on their issues has been outstanding.  Rating based on two player play. Based on the downtime experienced in my two player games I don't think I'd enjoy it with more than three. Fun theme, and worth looking into if you like pick up and deliver games. 

Ultimately - traded.  I have too many wargames that are just better than this.

RATING: 8
Yet again, Numbskull Games have produced a tightly designed, playable hybrid – euro/war/economic mix. The theme is brilliantly functional and integrates well in your decision making. The components are very good. The rules are kept to a minimum and  yet, I don’t feel that there is a need to add anything else. There is a collective challenge in the Union Actions and individual challenge in working around those to run the blockade, hoping not to lose ships to the Union Navy, and then having a balance of choices to pick from. And if you don’t keep bringing in the War Goods…

Another brilliant game from the boys at Numbskull and for this Civil War buff, a hearty well done!

The rules were quick to learn and the theme and game play are nice.  I would have rated it higher, but I found the game bits to be cheap.  The paper money, although it looks good, is too thin and several bills got creased after one play.  The markers didn't punch smoothly and have frays.  I found the wood cubes frustratingly fiddly and my copy was missing the dice and the 'smokestacks' don't fit well.  I contacted Numbskull Games and to their credit they quickly replied and stated they would send dice and replacement smokestacks when they came in as they weren't happy with them either.  5/15/11  The replacement parts don't really work, either. 

The game itself is lack luster, not much going on there. I really wanted to like it but I just don't. The play testing seemed to have been lacking to ensure there was a real game here.

Thematically I think it accheives what it sets out to accomplish with it's gameplay but the game is a bit slow and perhaps a bit too chaotic. Initial rating based on the out of the box ruleset. I belief some house rules are needed to address the disadvantage of being last in turn order on the first turn...perhaps each player after the first should receive and incremental 2k in starting money more that the previous player. Additionally I think a few of the action cards only seem worthy of play if they were playable reactively as free actions.

Perhaps the most brutal "euroish" game I own. It is a different kind of simulation, because it does portray quite well some aspects of commerce in war times.

The game was fun.  I liked the theme and how it played. It was a bit random as the blockades can show up where you do not want them, or the High Seas Fleet can show up just when you need your fleet to get out.  It was also a bit slow.  Even with only three players it was a long time between turns as there is a lot for each player to do.  We played with three players and it may get worse with more players.

A pickup and deliver game with a unique theme (runners evading Union blockades to deliver resources to foreign ports, while bringing hoome black market goods and military supplies in support of the confederacy). Ships are sold via auction, action cards assist with mobility and capacity, ports are captured by Union troops over time (although this can be slowed by the influx of military goods, for which transporting players also get a bonus), and when your captain finds himself face to face with the Union navy, die-rolls (along with support from friendly forces) ultimately determine whether you escape unharmed or take a hit to your fleet. Despite the theme, most definitely a Euro style strategy game.

The game lasts 5 turns reflecting the five years of the war, 1861-65.  Players represent blockade runners who buy cotton & tobacco from Confederate ports and sell to foreign ports.  At foreign ports, you can buy black market goods and pick-up war materials to sell to Confederate ports.  The purchasing price per item remains constant, while the selling price will fluctuate up & down depending on supply & demand.  As the war progresses, the Union naval blockade tightens, ports close due to assaults, and inner cities are captured making trade goods more difficult to obtain. Player actions include load, unload, move, bid on new ships, and play specialty cards that can effect play.  Overall, the game is a thematic reflection of blockade running during the Civil War.  The cardboard ships are identified by name, speed, and cargo capacity; however, the color pegs placed on the ships to identify ship ownership are unstable.  Be prepared to use alternative solutions for ship ownership.

The only downside is that this game does not scale.  It heeds a house rule with 2 players in that the number of ports and inland cities that disappear due to not enough war goods coming in is brutal.  It could be solved by a simple chart showing how many war goods "neutral" blockade runners were bringing in each turn and that would be added to the number of war goods total delivered.  It seems to me to be about 
Players      War goods

But I would have to play test it

Our first 2 player game that only brought in 2 goods turns 1852 - 1863 because of setup and very small boats with out the cashflow to buy enough big boats during those turns due to not enough actions between 2 players to get in a ship auction just hammered us.  you may be able to scale those extra adds in by dropping 1 per year but in the 5 player game the number of war goods delivered went up every year due to lack of anything else to deliver

Blockade Runner is a resource trading game in the Euro style, but with a dash of danger. In Blockade Runner, players take on the roles of entrepreneurs attempting to make the most money by shipping cargo in and out of the South during the American Civil War. Positioning is achieved by competing with each other for access to commodities, top market prices, and newly built ships. Hard decisions include whether to play safely to keep ships afloat or take potentially profitable risks. The crux of the play is hinged upon whether to bring in vital war goods, which reduce the intensity of the growing blockade, or more profitable black market goods. This enables a potential for cooperation, but competition is the heart of the game.

Beautiful components. I love the great & splendid map.

An interesting idea and concept but the execution doesn't quite live up to expectations. There are issues with components, the rules are not as clear as they could be, and the game does not scale well between different number of players. Worth a look though for those interested in the theme.

One game, 6 players, provisional rating.  We all felt afterwards that the rules should include something to soften the loss of a ship, reckoning that a single sinking would similarly sink any chance of a player winning.  However, I'm not sure we approached the game "right", with only one ship auction in the first 4 years and little rail movement due to the infrequent shortage of goods.  Perhaps if we'd been buying more ships there would have been a more even distribution of sinkings and with more income from shipping the loss of ship value would have been less significant.

A very interesting take on an economic game, if only for the theme alone. I like that the game incorporates a semi-cooperative element, as the players need to keep the Union blockade at bay, however the game can still only have one winner, i.e. the player with the most money at the end. The temptation is to deliver the expensive goods, but if the players don't deliver enough cheap war goods, then the Union forces will make it really difficult to conduct any business at all!  I also appreciate that games don't tend to play out the same way, with the random distribution of action cards and the random manner in which the Union will attack ports. Very tight design and I can't wait to get hold of the advanced cards expansion. Two thumbs way up!

Pretty good game. A little long between turns and the ships are a little hard to sink with three die. Also not sure if the black market goods are too profitable even with the penalties. But I would play again.

An interesting and different game that has very large, but usually avoidable luck events.

If you hate luck in your games, you won't like this one.  But, for the rest of us, it is well worth playing.

My only real gripe is that the smokestacks don't stay on the ships.

I can't really see playing it with more than 4, however.  With 4, it was enjoyable.  With more, I'd see the downtime really creating issues.

A lot more interesting than the theme would imply.  Would rate higher except for the down time between turns.

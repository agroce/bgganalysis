RATING: 9
This isn't my favorite game, but it is my wifes. She loves the fact that each time she plays it, she learns something new. It is a great family game, scales well for additional players, and games are rarely blowouts - which means there's always a chance for someone to win. There is hardly any chance to the game, which means strategy and spite help, but aren't always the key to victory. Each game plays different than the last, and we are always eager to play again and again.

RATING: 6
Only played with 2 players and it was pretty limited at this count. I suspect there is more to explore with more players (pun intended…)

Ultimately, this game is beautifully illustrated but the gameplay is less complex than Ticket to Ride and really has nothing to offer me.

Traded away for Steam.

RATING: 8.5
Rating based on the advanced game (Kickstarter version).
Components [10/10] - Absolutely first class - excellent cards, board, miniatures and one of the sturdiest boxes I've seen.
Cost [8/10] - Reasonable for what you get.
History/Theme [20/20] - Lots and lots of excellent flavor text on the cards.  I believe some of the dates are wrong (depends on your view of evolution vs creation) on 5 of the 79 cards but that's easily fixed with a sharpie ;-)  Great for teaching geography and some history.
Strategy [6/10] - Some strategy but overall fairly light.  More strategic than I originally thought (rating changed from 5 to 6).
Fun Factor [8/10] - Enjoyable, light, family game.  Rating increased from 7 to 8.
Replayability [10/10] - Likely to be different every time.
Length [8/10] - Likely 1-1.5 hours which seems ok.
Intangibles [15/20] - Far exceeded my expectations in component quality and flavor text.  Gameplay is fun but not quite to the level of great - explorers, event cards, and hazard tickets definitely help in this area.  Advanced rules could be clearer in the rulebook - it'd be nice to have all the advanced rules together instead of having to combine them with the basic rules.  Increased from 12 to 15 as it seems to improve with play.

Overall: [85/100] = 85.0%

Edit: Rating increased from 8 to 8.5 after more play - seems to be getting better with more experience.

Haven't used the explorers yet, but it's largely the original game.  The color choices and graphic design here are fair but the rest of the production value is excellent.  Oddly laid-out rules.  It's a good classic game.

Although this is touted as a "family" game, it is very competitive, even cutthroat, so I hope your family members have thick skins! With that said, there are lots of interesting things going on in this game. The game is almost purely tactical, and your plans can change from turn to turn depending on what your opponents do. Sometimes it is worth going for the scoring cards or diverting a route away from an opponent's special destination even if it means you won't get to a location in your hand.

The "advanced" rules are not really that advanced, and make the game a lot better, so unless you're playing with kids I'd start using them right off the bat.

Vastly underrated game. I have yet to try it with six, but plays very well so far with 3, 4, and 5.

People keep saying it's the advanced version of Transamerica, but I'm not getting that at all since everyone can influence the shared routes being built instead of focusing on their own. I'd say that makes it closer to Isla Dorada, but much much better.

A likeable and fun path building game. The rules around loops need to be a bit more detailed with several more examples. Having separate markers to place on the board for the location of the 'public' destinations would also have been useful.

I've wanted to try Kramer's "Exploration" and had no idea a new version came out. What joy! It was actually better than I expected. I thought it'd be too chaotic or too simple, but it hit a nice spot of trying to manipulate the expeditions for points. Tight game too. Not sure about replayability in the long run, but a nice game to close out the night.

The loop rule is more restrictive as is the ticket rule.  But I'm not sure these are good idea.  The extra cards and the face down display cards are interesting ideas but I'm not sure how well they work.  The explorer cards cost a lot and need to be bought before the other others but they are not useful until late in the game.

Card routing game based upon famous explorer locations on a world map. Score points by moving 3 "caravans" over your properties while diverting around other players spots. Some issues with determining "legal loops", and the artwork could have made the map locations easier to find by providing better visibility in colour coding ... but overall this game was quite fun, enjoyable, light fare.

Explore the world.  Players are building three routes simultaneously, from the same starting point, to try to connect to destinations in their hands and common destinations on the table.  At the beginning of the game, you designate some of your routes as special routes that score double.  There are ways you can place extra pieces on your turn (to extend routes) or remove pieces from the map (to shorten them, usually so you can take the route in a different direction).  I wasn't blown away, but it's okay.

Expedition: Famous Explorers is an updated version of two award-winning Wolfgang Kramer games – Wildlife Adventure and Expedition – with a new theme: discovery and exploration. Players lead three expeditions to various locations by placing arrows on a map. When an expedition arrives at a location that matches either a location card held by that player or a public location, that player scores that card by placing it in front of him.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is another solid entry in the Wildlife Adventure or Expedition mode.  Placing one of three color arrows, one is finding locations and/or explorers.  In this one, every player selects four locations to be public from one's hand and one seeks to complete those locations for +2 points.  If you fail, you lose 2 points!  As well, there are additional advanced options in the game which I'm curious to explore which can grant additional end game points if you meet certain conditions as well as secret objectives which can be completed for 2 points as well. 

================================================

I should have kept my Wildlife version - prefer its art and theme. Thought I would like this one more, but I was wrong. Still, it is an excellent game, just prefer one of the other themes. Sold.

A remake of the old Expedition which I find pretty interesting. There is text provided with a little background for the locations to visit which is great stuff to read while waiting for your turn though it is interesting enough to see what other players are doing. 

I can do without the added features of the game over the older version especially the event cards this game just doesn't need these added distractions and it feels like something that was just tossed in without much thought.

I really like Wildlife Adventure that this is similar to, but I can't say the same for this one.  I really hate the way the loops work.  It seemed to make it too easy to get where you needed to go.  I like the routes to just extend off the end of where they are headed.  if you played this game with the Wildlife Adventure rules it would be much better.  I also liked the animal theme much better.

I like the kinds of games that teach a bit of real history as you play. The bonus this game gives is that it is also actually fun and challenging.

Oh my, this game has an ugly box. And an ugly board. And ugly cheap feeling plastic bits. And it has - the horror - pictures instead of illustrations on some bits. Ugh. But let's not judge a book by it's cover. After all, this game is designed by Kramer, who I consider to be one of the most consistent designers when it comes to quality designs.
The rules are ridiculously simple. So we jumped right into the 'advanced' version with some extra cards. It was still very light and family friendly. Unfortunately this simplicity didn't lead to a perfect rule book, as some questions where not answered by the rule book. But we came to a consensus and the game held up well.
This game reminded me a bit of [thing=2842][/thing] because everyone has secret destinations on cards and you collectively build a network and the game ends when someone finishes all his destination cards. But there are 3 networks and each network has only one point at which it can be extended by the next player.
We enjoyed this game. It's more compelling than you would expect from the rules. Or the ugly artwork. It works well. But it's not a strategic masterpiece, it's a fine family game.

Initial rating: 6.8/10

This did feel a lot like TransAmerica: the world map. Except with some pretty poor graphic design choices. I'd play again with the advance variant but I'm not excited to have seen this resurface.

Love it! Though I prefer the loop rules from the National Geographic version and will use those (after creating loop, can play off any arrow point of that expedition). Determining which arrows constitute the loop is often difficult and just leads to arguments.

Can't compare this to any other game, because I've never played anything else like it. A decided classic that sooooo deserved a reprint! I'm sooooo sooooo grateful that 8th Summit made it happen. They did a beautiful job! Kudos!

Expedition: Famous Explorers is a reprint of the Wolfgang Kramer arrow games. The graphic design is hard-to-read.  Worse, new rules have been added that would have been easy to execute in the other printings, but here they add to the cosmetic morass.

OK- the rulebook could be better, the cards a bit higher quality. However, this game really snuck up on me, as it never hit my radar.

Don't let the busyness of the map scare you away- it is a breeze to learn, teach and play, taking about an hour with 4 players.

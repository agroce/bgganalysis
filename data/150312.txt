A good take on the Love Letter type game. Bluffing but still with some strategy and creates some really tense moments when you're going through the Dungeon. The decision of how to print cards is baffling but once you've sorted them all out it's not an issue.

RATING: 7
Fun game with bluffing and some thought involved.  Not a lot, since it's a light game, but went over quite well.  It's almost like a party game, where you're just having fun and enjoying the gameplay, without worrying about who wins or loses.

Note: If playing as two-player, and there is a mismatch in deduction skill, play a different game.  This plays much better with 3-4 due to the chaotic joy, playing with two player feels very adversarial and not as much fun due to knowing too much of what is in the dungeon.

Traded this one out since the wife does not enjoy it, based on the aforementioned mismatch in probability and deduction.

A microgame that stands out for the cool idea, the beautiful artwork and the high quality of its components! 

The game is very simple. It's pure push your luck with some bluffing and memory involved, but it's nonetheless entertaining and exciting, especially when you're flipping the cards one by one, when it can mean that you either win or lose the game.

There's not a great deal of re-playability in Welcome to the Dungeon, but it's a good game to play every once in a while, especially when you don't have the space to play something bigger.

1st play: played with the wife and really enjoyed the theme. Plays quick and pushing your luck is fun. It can feel a little randomly, but a pleasant diversion. 

2nd play: played with gamers and we tend to push our luck a bit. The game doesn't feel too serious and for what it is it's fine.

A wonderful game that I would describe as Skull that works for 2 players. In fact, I believe the game would be more strategic with 2 players, as you know 50% of all drawn threats. It suffers the same fate as Skull though; it drags on. I'd recommend Liar's Dice or Indian Poker.
Pro: Great art, variable powers, Well-machined box

Went into it thinking it would be the ideal filler. Was so boring that I thought I was playing this wrong.

Looked at the rules and realized it really doesn't play how I thought it would play. It's amazing how anticlimactic the final resolution was, even among people who like the dungeon clearing theme.

Couple friends love this one more than I do, but it's a solid light filler that's a good push-your-luck game.  Unfortunately it doesn't feel terribly satisfying, maybe because of the genre's normal randomness?  Mechanically it's pretty solid though, and it's short enough that I can't complain.

Pushing my luck and bluffing are two of my favourite things.  Welcome to the Dungeon gives me both in a bite sized package.  The idea of a hero gradually shedding equipment while the hoard of adversaries grows is amusing. There's tension, there's laughter and it's all done in 15 minutes.  A tasty snack.

My IELLO edition has jolly artwork and good production quality.  The rules are OK, but could have used an extra page or two explaining the equipment powers in a little more detail.

ίδα το κουτάκι και το όμορφο artwork και είπα να κάτσω για καμιά παρτίδα. Welcome to the Dungeon λοιπόν, θεματικό φιλεράκι με απλούς κανόνες και χαβαλεδιάρικο gameplay. Διαλέγουμε τυχαία έναν ήρωα ο οποίος θέλει να μπει στο dungeon για την δόξα και το χρήμα. Εμείς στη σειρά μας τραβάμε μια κάρτα-τερατάκι και ή το τοποθετούμε κρυφά στο dungeon είτε το κάνουμε discard και αφαιρούμε ένα equipment από τον ήρωα. Κάποια στιγμή που θα σφίξουν τα γάλατα καθώς θα έχει τιγκάρει με τέρατα to dungeon και ο ήρωας θα κοντεύει να μείνει γυμνός από το βγάλε βγάλε, θα αναγκαστούμε να πούμε πάσο.

Ο τελευταίος πρόθυμος παίκτης παίρνει τον ήρωα με ότι εξοπλισμό του απέμεινε και μπαίνει στο dungeon. Αν καταφέρει και σκοτώσει τα πάντα τότε παίρνει ένα πόντο (στους 2 κερδίζεις) αν τον σκοτώσουν οι ορδές των τεράτων τότε ο παίκτης τρώει ένα damage (στα 2 χάνεις και βγαίνεις από το παιχνίδι) Οι μάχες είναι απλούστατες, είτε ο ήρωας έχει το κατάλληλο όπλο για το κάθε τέρας ή τον χτυπάνε και χάνει life. Ξεκάθαρα πράματα.

Το ότι τα τέρατα μπαίνουν στο dungeon και γίνονται discard στα κρυφά δίνει στο παιχνίδι ένα αίσθημα ψευτο-μπλόφας/deduction ή push your luck πες το όπως θες. Ξέρεις μόνο το τι τέρατα έβαλες εσύ. Οπότε προσπαθείς να καταλάβεις αν τα equipment που έχουν απομείνει στον ήρωα είναι χρήσιμα ή όχι. Αν το life του ήρωα είναι αρκετό για να αντέξει τις επιθέσεις.

Αξιόλογο φιλεράκι. Όμορφο, απλό και γρήγορο. Καλή ποιότητα παραγωγής. Το συμπάθησα αμέσως.

A push your luck game with player elimination and poor theme and artwork. It has a strange mechanism where players want to kill the game and it comes down to who is unluckiest to be forced into the Dungeon through no choice of their own.

It doesn't work as an auction game, a push your luck game nor a bluffing game and there are many other superior games I would play instead even though it has a fairly short playing time.

In this game, players are weakening the hero or passing. If they pass, they can't win/lose. But if every player has passed but one, that one player becomes the hero and goes into the dungeon... and thus will either win/lose. If you win twice or manage to outlive everyone else, you win the game (This game has player elimination, but it plays very quickly).

Mechanically speaking, this game provides a twist on the whole reverse auction mechanic and facilitates a bluffing element. In practice, it feels like a push-your-luck game with bluffing. Overall, it's intriguing, simple to learn, and fast to play. It's one of those fillers that is nice to have around.

RATING: 8.2
Welcome to the Dungeon is definitely a party game.
Strictly nothing is serious in this game and the mechanism is pretty simple : Everything is based on risk calculation.

This game is not that interesting when played with 2 players. So you should mainly consider it with 3-4 players ;-)

Being a party game, you should expect a game to last about 10 minutes (+/- 3 minutes). Knowing there are 4 different characters to play in the 2015 version (not the japanese original version), it will take you 10x4 minutes maximum to understand the entire game.

Beware, you shouldn't play this for more than 30 minutes, it will get boring!

So as a party game, a filler, it is perfect.
If you are looking for something more serious, just forget it!

A game of dare, in card form. You're going to chuck away your armour before venturing into the dungeon? I'll chuck away my armour. You'll put another monster in the dungeon? I'll put another monster in. You'll discard your dragon spear? Good luck with the dungeon mate, I'm outta here.
It's more thematic than Skull, to which it is sometimes compared, and with more choices. 
One small complaint: I wish the names of the monsters were printed on the monster cards, or at least the player aid cards, as opposed to only in the rules. That means, especially among new players, that monsters tend to be referred to by strength, which is printed on the cards. EG: "I'll kill the 5 with my Vorpal Sword", as opposed to "I'll kill the Golem with my Vorpal Sword". It slightly detracts from the theme.

Pro's:

1) Artwork, style, the chits themselves, the build the dungeon mechanism part.
2) Game is pretty quick.

Con's:

1) The mechanism becomes stale really quickly, it is fortunate that the game is over quickly.
2) Actually going through the dungeon for some reason never feels as rewarding as it should be, win or lose. This may be because I have not developed a good meta game with it to really figure out how and when people play the cards, certainly this is probably my fault and not any reflection of the game.

RATING: 7
This is a small push your luck, game where you are an adventurer who is considering going into the dungeon to face the monsters within. On your turn you either secretly add a monster to the stack, or you take away one of the pieces of equipment that whoever ends up going in will use. If you decide you don't want to risk having to go in against the monsters there using the equipment left, you can back out, that is, if you aren't the last person left. Once one person is left in, they face the monsters with the rest of the equipment. If they make it through, they get a victory csard, if they fail, they flip their card to the red side. 2 deaths and a player is eliminated, 2 victories and a player instantly wins. 

Dead simple, easy to teach and to understand, fairly quick usually, but with interesting decisions to be made for sure.

Also, I really like the artwork & graphic design of this one.  Really glad to have this in my collection!

This is a great filler game. We have even managed to play this silently at a rather dull staff party, during the speeches. It made the evening bareable. Ultimately, this is a fun game of chicken. The art work is nice, and the inclusion of different heroes gives you enough variance that you can play this multiple times without getting bored.

Pretty entertaining and very fast, if not always the most profound play experience. The different personalities within your group will definitely shine through. I enjoy the silly twist on a fantasy theme. A fun party game.

I recommend playing with the Wizard, which has multiple victory conditions and therefore allows for the most interesting strategizing.

Fun little Press your Luck game.  You start with a fully equipped hero, and take turns drawing monsters to put in the dungeon, and after drawing you can either put the monster in the dungeon, or remove the monster form the game and also one of the hero's items.  If you don't want to delve into the dungeon as the hero, you pass your turn to draw a monster.  last person who doesn't pass has to enter the dungeon and try to kill all of the monsters with whatever equipment he has left.  Make it alive out of the dungeon twice and you win.

RATING: 6
I like the premise of the game, but you need the right group of people. If people don't talk then it will most likely be boring. The main grab of the game is the push your luck and hope you get out alive. I like to play to 3 deaths and 3 wins especially for a 2 player game. Quick and easy though.

If you've ever read any of the Battletech books then you're pretty familiar with the premise of this game... Basically players are bidding to see who will enter the dungeon with the least amount of equipment or against the most monsters. The winner of the game is the first player to either successfully complete the dungeon twice or the last player standing. A light straightforward game where you're trying to out think your opponents, I like it.

Cute little combo of bluffing and pressing your luck. If you primarily are interested in this game for the bluffing aspect, there's other games I would recommend over this. But if you're interested in the press-your-luck dungeon crawl, this game is definitely worth checking out.

I feel like one of the main things that separates this from other small bluffing games is that there's a lot more content to internalize that affects decision-making. All the information about the makeup of the deck and stuff is open, but the need to balance that with the equipment tiles in your head makes it a harder game to just jump right into vs. something like Liar's Dice or Cockroach Poker. It takes a couple of rounds to figure out how to bluff and read other player's moves.

But there is good potential for bluff and it's all a big game of chicken where you're trying to back your friends into corners and really, who doesn't love that?

A press your luck sort of game.  Each dungeon starts will a full list of cards that would deem a success.  Each player plays a card and takes away one of the "winning" options in the dungeon.  This keeps on going until you say its impossible or delve in.  If the last one succeeds they get a point.  First one to succeed three times (?) wins.

RATING: 6.75
This game didn't appear to have much substance to it, and I wasn't very keen to play it. But when your better half buys the game thinking it will be cool, you have to give it a whirl.

I was pleasantly surprised. While there isn't much depth, it is a rather clever game of chicken and outguessing your opponents. Take an equipment tile out of the mix and you risk being sent into the dungeon severely handicapped. But if you pass you've lost the opportunity to score a crucial success card.

A very fast filler that helps pass the time. I think we'll keep this for awhile. One minor quibble – the rules spell out how you win/lose in the dungeon rather poorly, and actually had me confused at first. It would have been much simpler to say, “If you have any hitpoints left – you survived! Take a success card.”

This is a push your luck delve into a dungeon but is based on bluffing and guessing how hard it will be to defeat the monsters.  It was much better than I expected it to be.

For what this game tries to do, it does it very well.  It is a light, press your luck game for 2-4 players, and each player takes a turn drawing a new "monster" card from the deck and has to decide whether to add it to the dungeon, or keep it out of the dungeon and instead remove a piece of gear from the hero that will face the dungeon when all but one player has passed.  If the player survives the dungeon, they get one victory point (2 points wins), if they die, they get one "death" point (2 deaths and you're out).  The game is far more tense than I imagined it would be, and not knowing exactly what others have added to the dungeon is where the challenge comes in.  I bought the "Welcome Back to the Dungeon" game for my brother, and that included a nice health track and health marker, which I wish was included in this original game as it is very handy (I just made up my own on a notecard which I keep with the game.  Doesn't look as nice, though).

A small "push your luck" game trying to fill a hidden discard pile with monsters but trying to not be the last player to add a monster. The last player who adds a monster and doesn't pass has to go through the deck with the displayed hero and their equipment. If you can use the equipment and still have HP remaining, you get a point. The game ends when a player has either 2 points or dies twice. It's a pretty standard rule set for this type of game. I personally didn't enjoy the theme and since so much of the game is driven by the theme, it's rated just a tad lower for me.

Fun little Japanese game where players are all playing the same generic dungeon entering hero.  Players take turns either secretly seeding the dungeon with one of 13 monsters, or withholding a monster from the dungeon but also removing a vital piece of the hero's equipment.  When the dungeon is looking too dangerous, players begin to pass, and last one standing has to run the dungeon.  If they fail, they take a wound - two wounds you are out of the game.  Two successful dungeon runs is a victory.  Really fun minimalist game, firmly in the Love Letter / Skull family.  Works well.

C: "Pshaw, I can beat 5 without even using my spear!"

And then adventurer A and B said "Okay, you do it then", and adventurer C gets eaten by a Dragon.

SOLD IT! ($11)

Great mini game that merges a well represented theme with the concept of playing chicken. Great filler and easy to teach and snag players over to your table.

I sold it since I personally just got bored of it and began to sour on mini games for being a bit samey after a few plays.

RATING: 6
Played once. An enjoyable filler, if you like "pressing your luck" and trying to double-think what your opponents are going to do. The game feels like you don't have a whole lot of control, though, and there's a significant amount of guessing.

Fun push-your-luck micro game. Component quality and artwork are exceptionally fantastic. I was surprised to find a small bluffing component as well (Did he just put an easy monster into the dungeon because he knows he can beat it, or a tough monster because he's going to pass next turn and knock me out?). The play is similar to other push your luck and bluffing games like Liar's Dice, Skull, or Cockroach Poker. This one is slightly more complex because of the numerous equipment abilities and symbols on the monster cards. Players can be eliminated but the game time is very short. 

Welcome Back to the Dungeon included, it all barely fits in one box.

This game blew me away as I bought it on a whim but WOAH.

For such a simple game of pushing-your-luck, bluffing and doubling-down it is amazingly engaging.  Yes there is a lot of a luck but this is definitely a game gamers could enjoy for a filler or new gamers would love as an introduction.

+ Such a great medium-light filler game.  I really like the push your luck aspect and the different adventurers.

RATING: 7
Interesting push-you-luck deduction type microgame whereby your hero sheds more and more equipment as the monsterous horde grows, until finally only one brave player remains and then the adventurer runs the gauntlet, and hopes they make it our the other side, make it out twice and you win.

Really surprised as this is still very good fun even after many many plays :)

Un party game dynamique et fun. Pas mal de bluff et de calcul. Je suis pas sur de la rejouabilité sur le long terme mais c'est un jeu à moins de 15 €. Au final le jeu ne s'use pas si vite et l'extension rajoute de la variété.

L'extension est moins bien que le jeu de base ; moins limpide est plus brouillone.

IL est très difficile de jouer avec des gens de niveau (et d'expérience différente).

I like the concept but it's difficult to get people to play this, especially play it well. There's something about wrapping your head around how the game works. Seems there's always someone at the table giving up and just playing silly. While the strategy of making random moves in ineffective and will get the player eliminated, it still kills the mood for the rest of the players.

Components: good tiles and good cards

Players: 4, good also with 3
Length: good one, although it has elimination
Opinion: good filler to play where you want to. It is not hard to teach, but the theme does not help you to do that (dungeons are not known everywhere). Once you have understood the bluff and the push your luck part, the game is a gem. Should I risk one more monster or it is time to run away. Only thing I would disappoint is the elimination, if you are eliminated early in the game, although the game is fast, it is not so enjoyable.

A supercharged game of chicken that plays in 5-10 minutes. Ace.

However, I should rap Iello on the knuckles for a poor English translation. Some of the cards are highly ambiguous, or actively contradict the rulebook or subsequent clarifications made on baordgamegeek by Iello. No excuse, for such a major publisher, especially for a game with such a small amount of flavour text in the first place! I'm annoyed with myself when I play a game wrong - but when it's because the wording on the cards is actually incorrect, I'm annoyed at the publisher.

Excellent micro-game that I must add to my collection. It is a quintessential push your luck game, and has the same feel as black jack, or even poker where you're trying to read your opponents and fill in the missing bits of information. On top of that, there's just enough theme for an ameritrasher such as myself to buy into it. Each round is so short that it is hard to hold any of the game's minor failings against it. Like, like, like.

Pequeño y bonito juego, lo que más me ha gustado son sus ilustraciones. La mecánica es de subastas ciegas, lo cual es algo que no me agrada mucho, se dan situaciones caóticas y a veces muy azarosas, lo curioso, es que el juego cuenta con un apartado de ilustraciones graciosas y un tema desenfadado, pero parece que hay que ir contando cartas para ver si te interesa seguir en la puja.

La parte del dungeon tampoco me pareció interesante, muy pocas decisiones importantes, como la vida misma.

El juego es bastante correcto, pero no es mi tipo de juego, me da la sensación de que se juegan varias rondas y al final uno gana.

Si todos pasan menos uno ese que no pasó entra al calabozo y con las herramientas y armas que sobrevivieron las rondas de selección, ve si puede superar los horrores que se acumularon en el calbozo. Si lo logra gana un punto, si no recibe una herida. El que reciba dos heridas sale de juego, el que gane dos PV gana el juego.

[b]Workplace & 2 Player Review:[/b] 

It's short but entertaining. It's not too deep but no two games are the same. It brings our everyone's poker faces but the fun factor is through the roof. I was introduced to this game at the Tokyo Game's Market 2013, and the crowd that gathered around the table confirmed that it was not only me that was intrigued by the game play. The theme is just the icing on the cake, even though "Men" are not the only ones I've seen enjoy this Dungeon of Mandom. 

It's been a huge hit during breaks at work, with coworkers almost daily coming to request a match. Even after introducing several other great fillers that they have all enjoyed, the requests keep coming for more Mandom. I'm guaranteed a good time even when breaking it out at a restaurant with the boyfriend. Get it if you can!

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Easy to pull out and play at work everyday. 
- Games are variable with different strategies ridden to victory, or one's own doom, every time.
- In micro-game fashion, games are very quick.
- Every time you flip a card there are cheers and surprises abound.
- It has a very small footprint
- More people increases the bluffing factor and intrigue. 2 player is much more tactical.
- 2 player is a great "waiting for your food" filler at a restaurant. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- It is what it is. Short and sweet. A great filler and a surprising amount of meat on a tiny bone.
- Can't play it on the train. haha

Welcome to the Dungeon is a very light, luck-pushing game that is a bit more luck-based than I prefer, but redeems itself in two ways.

First, unlike many other luck-pushing games, the odds of failure climb not steadily but in major bursts every time a hero's equipment is removed. This gives the game an interesting feel where a safe bet one turn can quickly become a dangerous proposition.

The second stand-out attribute of this game is the big reveal. Even for players who are eliminated, it is exciting to watch a player take on the dungeon and see if their judgement is accurate.

It's not a perfect game and isn't too deep, but it's quick, portable, and easy-to-learn with some exciting moments - all good characteristics for a filler game to have.

Beautifully tense game of chicken.

Lowered to a 7 because the game isn't as good with 2, and the player elimination means every game is eventually down to 2 players.

Having played more Cockroach Poker, I think Cockroach Poker manages to be a better pure bluffing game without the player elimination and the going through the dungeon minigame, which takes up time and only involves one player at a time. I think I'd always rather play Cockroach Poker.

Initial Rating: 5.5 (June 2015)

I bought the game without any knowledge about it (as usual), but it was fun....at first. Then, we played it again and it began to be boring for me.

The art of the game is great and I enjoyed the idea behind it, however it gets old and repetitive very quickly.

The rules are very simple and you can explain it under 2 minutes, you can play it under 20 minutes. I think those are its best advantage. It features player elimination but as the game is so fast, I don’t care much.

I enjoy the theme. With 4 players there is a lot more luck/chaos that with 3 players, so I prefer to play it with 3 players.

Bottom line, an ok “push your luck” game to play from time to time. I feel it becomes very repetitive rather quickly. I already sold my copy of the game but I would play if requested.

2016-07-11 - My first impression is that this is a pretty good press your luck game. The gameplay itself is pretty good, but I think it's much better with 2 than with 4, just because the downtime is a bit much.

Welcome to the Dungeon is weird.  I think I like it, but at the same time I'm sort of "meh" about it.  I really love the artwork and the pieces are thick and feel good.  The gameplay is just fine for the type of game it is.  I don't know.  There's just something about that game that's like, "I should enjoy this, I do enjoy this, but I don't enjoy this."  Like I said, it's weird, but it's not bad.  That's all I can really say.

A fun idea for a game, and the component quality (like all Oink games) is very nice. I really enjoy bluffing games and this one feels pretty fresh, but when it comes down to it, does this offer anything that you can't find anywhere else? I'm not completely sure.

Improves on the original version of the game in all ways except for in the illustrations. I don't really care for the theme, so the fantasy illustrations are actually worse for me than the original abstract drawings.

Lo jugué a 2 jugadores y, como en la mayoría de juegos, supongo que mejora con más gente. La mecánica de juego me recuerda al "7 y medio", porque tienes que intentar plantarte en el momento justo.

En tu turno robas una carta y decides si añadir una criatura más a la mazmorra o quitar al héroe una pieza de equipo, siendo cada vez más complicado superar el nivel. De ahí lo de plantarse o retirarse a tiempo.

Super fun! It is quite random, but I don't mind that in this game. It produces a lot of cheering and groaning, games full of stupid mistakes, double bluffs, second guessing, and unlikely heroic wins. 

My only quibble is that you could be eliminated quite early and the game is not that short (30 minutes is accurate). I'm not sure about the longevity but since this is a small, inexpensive game I don't mind that either. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A light push-your-luck with a deduction component. Great production values, but I feel there aren't all that many possible combinations nor viable moves, which will make the game largely play itself once you are familiar with it. This makes it rather analytical, reducing room for small talk, which is sort of what I'm looking for when playing light-hearted games. Not my thing.

Out of nowhere, this little press-your-luck bluffing game has gotten a lot more plays than I was originally expecting. It's a very simple game: either look at a card and place it in the dungeon or keep an item from the stock OR simply say "pass" and hurl other players inside. Sending other players in to the dungeon to their doom is hilarious and rewarding!...until you see that they've been planting 1s and 2s into the dungeon that are defeated by that torch you didn't take out earlier! Lots of fun, lots of silliness, lots of bluffing and in just a few minutes of playtime.

A fun bluffing game disguised as a push-your-luck. There's an outside chance this might have some timing issues at some player counts, from my first look, but even if it does the bluffing element should mitigate them to an acceptable level for such a short game.

Update: Ultimately I just didn't care to choose to play this much, even if I don't mind it. I'd go to Skull before it almost every time, so I'm going to move it on.

Similar in concept to Gauntlet of Fools except only one person actually dungeon delves.  Everyone goes around either adding an unknown monster to the dungeon or pulls it back and takes away a weapon or armor piece to make it harder for the hero.  Or, one could pass and be safe.  If you die twice, you lose.  Win the dungeon dive twice and you win.  Fun, push your luck filler with quite a bit of bluffing, trash talk and table talk.  

The English version adds in a bit of variety in throwing in four adventurers to choose from with different equipment.

I wasn't sure about this one as it was being explained to me, but it turns out it's a really clever little game. A hero is going into the titular dungeon. Each turn you draw a card with a monster on it and either add it to the dungeon or remove one of the hero's items with it. Alternatively, you can pass and you're out, but the other person has to enter the dungeon and hope he can beat the monsters in there. So it becomes a game of chicken, trying to either hope you can ruin the dungeon for the other guy or make him *think* it's ruined so he'll let you go in and grab all the glory. It's a neat dynamic.

While perhaps my rating doesn't reflect it because I generally prefer games that aren't so light, this is one of the best fillers I've played so far. This is how you do push your luck correctly, not just your overdone draw cards till you think you should stop, but also with bluffing of what is in the dungeon deck, deduction of what your opponent could have put, and denial of key powers on the dungeon hero. I really like how this game has as much interaction as a take that game in that you can pass at a crucial moment and screw someone over, but you can choose if you put yourself in that position or not so it doesn't just feel random, kingmaking or wail on the leader. Each hero's equipment feel quite unique from the others, and you can also just draw 6 random tiles and still have the game work unless you e.g. get all +health tiles. While player elimination sucks, this game is short enough that it isn't too big of a deal, especially since you can kind of mitigate it by passing early if you're wounded.

This showed up on a lot of 2015 Top 10 and Top 100 lists, and I really just don’t get it. It feels very formulaic to me. Both times that I’ve played, no one beat the dungeon, and it was all a matter of whether or not you got stuck having to be the one that went into the dungeon. So, I just really didn’t get the point. I really did not like this game at all, and I have no idea why people enjoy it and what they get out of it. There are way better bluffing games.

Cute little filler where you can put a monster in the dungeon, take the monster you drew and take away some of the adventurer's equipment (there are six pieces of equipment) or pass.  Once everyone passes the last player must go into the dungeon with the remaining equipment.  If he defeats all the monsters with the equipment remaining you get a point.  If you fail you flip a reference card.  If you are successful twice, you win.  If you are defeated twice you are eliminated.  

It is a cool little filler.  It reminds of micro games like love letter.   I like it enough to be interested in the expansion

RATING: 5
This is a game where you need to understand a strategy for each card and why you are using it to discard a tile or putting it in the dungeon.at the start you dont really have that so its random. You dont understand the effect of each action. Although the game is short its not so short as to take no time to build up that information especially as you are using different adventurers.

The healing card seems rather over powered. It has player elimination. I don't think it is so short thats this is not a problem. I don't see how the elimination helps the game. I suppose it may be there to prevent completely reckless play but surely thats better than not playing or maybe not.

in summary, It was ok, I didn't really "get" the strategy failed both the 2 attempts I did and got eliminated without really understanding why. Didn't get more understanding from watching the others.

A fun game whether played solo or with a group. I like the modularity of the components: it makes creating new classes from existing (or even DIY) components easy. Great art and components, well-balanced, and with a push-your-luck style that actually gets everyone involved. It lends itself to all kinds of house-rules and variants, from solitaire style to using multiple adventurers at once and even more. And it costs a pittance. Check it out.

Mi opinión en [b]http://zacatrus.es/u/miqueljornet[/b]:

☛ Jugado en #LNMCMLDJ2016 en el Club Amatent (gracias a Freddy).

✔ Accesible juego de "exprime tu suerte" con engaño y puteo a partes iguales.
✔ El tema de la mazmorra le sienta muy bien y las ilustraciones son geniales.
✔ Hay que gestionar bien la (poca) información que te entra en cada ronda.
✔ Muy minimalista de componentes (a la japonesa).
✔ Se pueden dar rondas épicas. En este sentido, y en el que saca lo peor de cada uno de nosotros (algunos de los pecados capitales salen a relucir aquí a pequeña escala), recuerda un poco al también japonés "Deep Sea Adventure".

✘ Se podrían haber aprovechado los troqueles para hacer héroes en cada una de las caras y venir con 8 en lugar de los 4 a doble cara que trae el juego.
✘ Para los adictos al control, puede adolecer a grandes rasgos una sensación de falta del mismo. ¡Pero es un juego casual!
✘ Por el tipo de juego que es, brillaría si el rango de escalabilidad fuese mayor (de 3 a 6 jugadores, por ejemplo). Jugarlo a 2... no lo veo.

My greatest problem with this game is that my friends don't really play games repetitively, and this one really benefits from being played a good many times in a row.

The mechanics are dead-simple, but actually playing the game in an efficient / strategy based way isn't that self-evident. You need a couple under your belt to get how it's supposed to work and a couple more to get enough familiarity with the cards to really play with something close to "poker-type" strategy.

So it's a "filler" game - that should probably best be played as a kind of "main" game. Perhaps in some form of tournament-style structure?

If you have a group of friends who enjoy this game, this can really be a sort of "main activity" while you talk about stuff with beer and nachos. It's usually pretty predictable in outcome, but once in a while you get a really good "OMG" moment - which makes it great for a "pay half attention to game" sort of game.

A surprising hit for me, given that having the word "dungeon" in the title is usually a sure-fire way to instantly kill my interest in a game. However, this isn't one of those bog-standard dice chucking dungeon delving games that's basically just a dumbed down D&D style roleplaying experience transferred onto cardboard. Instead, this is a smart, simple, and quick push your luck game that could just as easily have been a game about stock market manipulation or race car driving. There's just enough of a twist to make it feel fresh and interesting in a genre that, like so many other genres, is awash in games with clever twists that are neither clever nor much of a twist.

Push-your-luck isn't necessarily my favorite, but it works here. The partial information you get as you're filling the dungeon and observing which items your opponent(s) discard actually tells you a lot. It's quick. It's got great components. And most importantly, it's fun.

On your turn you either add a monster to the dungeon or take away equipment from the hero about to venture into said dungeon or pass. When all but one player has passed, that player then takes on the role of the hero and tries to survive the dungeon.

The theme is what lowers this from close to a 10. The game is simply, easy and fun to play, but I really struggle to accept a game as part of my collection that has a special ability as a demonic pact...

...in spite of how good the mechanisms are, probably going to trade at next Maths trade.

Silly little game that is more fun than it has any right to be.

Gameplay is all bluffing and mindgames as you compete with other players to send an adventurer through a Dungeon, you pass or you take a monster card. If you see you can take it you add it to the dungeon, or you can discard it by discarding an equipment tile from the adventurer.

Essentially round by round you decide between pushing the stakes or getting out of the race. But the different monster types and special powers given by the equipment tiles make things way more uncertain and enable all sorts of mind games.

Western Iello edition changes all the lovable artwork of the original (for the worse if you ask me) but adds different classes of adventurers with their corresponding tiles, so the game definetly has more variety now. Seriously reccomended.

Welcome to the Dungeon is a push your luck game where the players are "bidding" with equipment, for the right to run a Dungeon. Can you survive it with five pieces? Well I can survive it with four! I had a great time with WttD as a quick and fulfilling filler game. The entertaing part of WttD comes from trying to gather information from your opponents; Why did he take our THAT equipment? What monster did he just add? If I added the dragon and he removed the dragon spear I probably should flee this dungeon. I do eagerly await an expansion that will add more heroes and maybe more monsters. As it is now, there are only four heroes and eight monsters. I don't want to say the game is same-y, but the prospect of more variety would excite me.

WELCOME TO THE DUNGEON is a fun one for RPG players as you will already know the tropes.   This one is a little more difficult to explain, but once you play a round it’s easy-peasy and a quick play.  Basically the players are vying to be the character going into the dungeon while also creating the dungeon.  Before you is a stereotypical hero (fighter, wizard, etc) and their magical items.  Each player takes their turn drawing a monster card. They can either add the monster to the dungeon (unseen to the other players), remove the monster from play while also removing a magical item, or pass and drop out of the running to play the character.  The drawing of monsters continues until there is one player left.  That player then enters the dungeon with whatever magical items are left and attempts to “battle” the monsters added by the players.  This is a multi-round game, as you play until one player wins the dungeon twice, or all other players fail twice and you are last player standing.  B+

Great little game that fits into the Skull and Love Letter niche, but with more of a game in there than both.  Seems so simple from the rules that you can't imagine it could be much fun.  You'd be wrong.  Very tense with some good decisions and a lot of second guessing.  Very nicely designed and balanced.  Oohs, aaahs, and a-has abound as cards are flipped during the resolution.  Highly recommended!

I really enjoy this bluffing style game.  The dungeon can really be utilized as an effective means of player elimination.  However, it is sometimes also fun to take the gamble and go stick with the game as long as possible so that you can traverse the dungeon and see if you survive.  My biggest complaint is that dungeoneering almost seems like the least viable strategy in the game.  Perhaps that is part of the fun: creating a horrible dungeon without realizing that you will be the one to traverse it.

Welcome To The Dungeon is just Incan Gold, but with Player Elimination and hidden information. The hidden information makes the game harder to introduce to new players who then may be eliminated first, forcing them out of the game where they may be waiting for quite awhile. Not an improvement.

Beautifully produced light party game about risk calculation (push-your-luck).

It is what [thing=129293]Gauntlet of Fools[/thing] should have been: more elegant, more streamlined, faster and components are much nicer.

It works very well with any number of players (from 2 to 4).

It's not the kind of game I'll want to play once and again, but one game every other month can be fun.

I have only played this with two players but I thought it was pretty strategic. 

Each player has a good idea of what is in the dungeon so you tend to be pretty cocky if and when you decide to take the plunge. I can't see that the different characters change the game much but it gives the appearance of more variety and the game art is terrific.

RATING: 7
I could easily see this/these getting a decent amount of replay. The game consists of just one decision each turn:
- If I draw a monster, can I add it to the dungeon safely because if everyone passes,  it seems like there are enough skill tiles available for me to kill all the monsters in the dungeon, or 
- can I remove a skill tile and still get through the dungeon if everyone then passes. 
As you have no idea what monsters the other players have added to the dungeon, it's basically guesswork. But at least it's fun guesswork. The start provides you the freedom to do things like use a low monster to kill off the best skill tile (with the intention of passing quickly), or putting in a low monster with the intention of staying in, and similar options with high monsters. These different approaches provide most of the interest in the game, together with different sets of skill tiles to assess each round. The biggest downside, which stops it being a purchase for me, is the player elimination aspect - when you want an opener or a closer, you want to be inclusive, not have people watching and not participating. But otherwise, a fun time while you're in.

Still trying to figure out if I like this game or not. Was expecting something similar to dungeon roll, but the mechanisms are completely different. It's bidding, and you can strip down a hero of all his equipment before he has to go in the dungeon, but there's the risk that you might be the one who has to run said hero through the dungeon. One thing I do love is the artwork, and yet again that's what attracted me to purchase this game. I really need to stop doing that. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
We all quite enjoyed this game, the first thing you note is the beautiful artwork, it is nice to see original art and you can tell a lot of effort went into it. The game is great as a stop over as its appeal does not last very long though, so after two games we thought it was best to move on to another game. It is a filler, you can either draw a card or pass. If you draw you chose to place the monster in the dungeon or remove a special ability. Once you pass you are out for the round. The goal is to be the first to complete two dungeons, meaning you are the last standing and then enter the dungeon or have every one else fail the dungeon twice. So you push you luck each time you draw, go too far and you may be stuck entering the dungeon with a week character. An original push you luck.

Fun and cute game with a sweet theme. Four player games can take too long (1h+) with non-gamers where I have the feeling this should be played rather fast. Also there's player elimination, which in a four player game feels bad when you're out first.

RATING: 3
It's exactly what I thought it would be. You build the dungeon as a group and make the hero less and less powerful to try to make it so that it becomes less likely that they will make it through. But, you want to drop out before that happens or set it up so that it will succeed if you're the one stuck with it.

Very little information to go off of, and the deck and heroes are pretty similar. I'd play it again, but not likely. The biggest redeeming feature of the game is that it's short.

Players add monsters to the dungeon, eliminate equipment from the shared 'character' or pass; last player left must face the dungeon. Survive the adventure twice and you win, eliminated if you fail twice.
Med-light filler, memory + press your luck (and light bluffing), does have player elimination, but it's a pretty quick game. Probably enjoy better with higher player counts.

RATING: 3
With three players, I found the chaos frustrating. With 4 players I was able to get more 'into' it. This is a basic filler game where players chose to pass or draw a card. If they take the card option, they look at it, and decide to put it into the 'dungeon' pile where the single hero NPC will eventually face it, or they can remove it from the game, but when they do so, they remove one piece of the adventurer's gear, weakening them. The last player to pass then gets a point if the adventurer lives through the dungeon. At it's core, it's just the normal push your luck game. It seems to want you to predict the cards your opponents add to the pile, but that's sort of flipping the coin, as you don't have anything significant to go on.

It's another bluffing/push-your-luck microgame, where players are daring each other to enter the dungeon and take on the monsters that lurk there. On your turn you can look at a monster card and either add it to the dungeon deck or throw it out and also discard one of the vital pieces of armour that the eventual adventurer will need to protect themselves. Different monsters are repelled by different items and you each have partial knowledge of what is and isn't the dungeon. When all but one players pass, the other player has to reveal the dungeon cards and decide his fate.

It has elements of the game Skull in it without the blatant levels of poker-like interactions, and for its weight and size is rather impressive. If you've got fifteen minutes or so you can probably get a game of this done, and it certainly fills the same sort of niche as skull, and I'd say is as good if not slightly better, so it certainly can fill a distinct spot in terms of types of games you might want to play. It feels a lot like Of Dungeons Deep, Dragon's Gold, and Skull mixed together, certainly outclassing the former two, and revisiting the elements of the latter.

So incredibly amusing with three players. I love doing things like putting the dragon into the dungeon right after another player removed the only weapon that can defeat it. Whether you have a good feeling about running into the dungeon or know you're basically doomed, it's always a blast. My husband and I liked the game so much that we attempted it with two (our usual play count) but the game kind of fell apart—it was fairly obvious whenever the other had put something terrible into the dungeon, and the game got a bit too predictable. Maybe we just know each other too well, but the magic wasn't there with just two players. Still, I'd play with three any time.

A interesting press your luck bidding game.  Trying to out guess your opponents and deduce what they may have put in the dungeon is fun.  A good filler game but maybe runs a little longer than it should. Feels like it could use a few for heroes to chose from so keep this one interesting.

Interesting game, which I've only played twice so far but would like to play again. It's a difficult game to describe, really it's push-your-luck but involving the whole group rather than just each individual player. Definitely another original short game to come out of Japan, and very different from Love Letter and its derivatives.

Fun little push your luck game. It is one that may take a couple plays through before you are able to get a good grasp of when to push and when to pass. You also have 4 characters worth of equipment to learn. However, the equipment is close enough in abilities that they aren't hard to understand. It also plays so fast that getting a couple learning rounds under your belt takes no time at all. Small box game that's easy to travel with.

Best microgame out there IMO, if for no other reason than the hilarity of watching somebody's face when they're a card away from making it through, but the last card was the dragon or the demon and they die.

It's basically just chicken, but in a dungeon crawl setting.  Surprisingly tactical at low player counts, and complete madness at higher counts.

Quick and nice push-your-luck game. I like the "Iello" artwork and the surface feel of the tokens. I would say: a perfect filler game! Sadly there are only four characters available in the base game so you are definitely interested in trying out the expansion.

Does a good job of filling 20 minutes with some light fun. Nothing too serious. I'll play when I want a break from the Love Letter and Coup fillers.

Simple to play, teach and learn. You'll be up and running in no time. Pick a character and if you're not passing you're making a decision after drawing a card - add the monster to the dungeon, or don't add it and in the process remove one piece of the character's equipment. Last person to stay in the round gets to fight the monsters in the dungeon.

There's a little bit of room for clever play, but most of the fun is in suckering or being suckered into the fight. There's pressure of not allowing a player with one success an easy fight. There's the temptation to be too reckless.

Not bad for something short and fun in a small box.

RATING: 3.5
A push your luck game which kind of lacks immediacy. Blame Incan Gold for spoiling me in the obvious department. 

It's bluffing meets risktaking and probably some groupthink involved. And some game of chicken. Players fill the dungeon with monters or remove hero's items or pass and the last one standing has to go in and hopefully win. Writing this I realise I need to play it more with different groups, I was just hoping it would fit for kids workshops. but it's not immediate enough (most of it happens in people's heads).

RATING: 6
A solid game of bluffing and pushing your luck, in which players take turns either adding a monster to the dungeon or removing a piece of equipment from the hero. When players think that the survival rate of the hero nears zero, they have to scram and leave the last soul standing to brave the dungeon.

The extra characters in the Iello edition are a welcome addition as they change up the required tactics. The Mage's Omnipotence spell, for example, offers a last gasp for victory and makes players pay extra attention to the types of monsters going into the dungeon.

Having said that, the actual gameplay experience feels oddly static, and the flow of the game is often disrupted by the inevitable pauses which occur as players take stock of the situation. While I initially assumed it was a group-dependent issue, the long pauses were also apparent even among more casual gamers. The game can also run long, which is especially apparent if you're eliminated early in a 4P game.

Light, push-your-luck microgame.  Players take turns either stacking face-down monster cards to create a "dungeon" or removing an adventurer's equipment until everyone passes and one player must try to conquer the dungeon with the remaining equipment.  The game plays relatively quickly, but takes a few runs to fully appreciate the strategies and can lead to some slow turns while players try to math things out.  Generally fun though, with nice solid components.

Excellent press-your-luck filler. The choices are awesome each round, as either make the dungeon harder or make the character weaker, and each time, you know that you may get stuck with the bad situation you've just created if everyone else passes. I love the different characters, and I like how there's actually two endgame conditions in play: you can conquer the dungeon, or you can die trying and get eliminated. It just adds to the tension, and makes this a compelling filler.

1 play, 4er

This is a cool, quick-playing, dungeon-themed microgame that feels a lot like [thing=92415]Skull & Roses[/thing] (but is still its own game). Push your luck by staying in the fight, bluff about what you've seen, remove key equipment if you plan (hope!) to abandon this round ... a lot of bluffing fun packed into a teeny tiny package! I wonder if I could make my own version with some of those thousands of [thing=463]Magic[/thing] cards I have laying around?

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Start the game by placing all the equipment (weapons, armor, and other tools) in display. The deck of cards has a bunch of different monsters in it, each of which attack with different strengths and can be countered by some weapon. On your turn, you can either:
- draw a card: either add it, face down, to the dungeon pile or take it AND remove one piece of equipment from the display.
OR
- pass: you're out for the rest of the round

After everyone else passes, the last player must face all the monsters in the dungeon pile, using only equipment still in the display. Countered (e.g., torch scares off weak monsters, holy water for undead, dragon lance for dragon) monsters do no damage, but the rest hit for some number from 1-9. Baseline HP and armor are used to absorb the damage. If you face them all without losing all your HP, you win the round.

The first player to win 2 rounds wins!

The iello version has 4 characters (warrior, barbarian, rogue, wizard), each with its own set of equipment tiles. There are new/varied equipment as well, going along with the new mix of characters. You can play with a different character every round so the game isn't quite as same-y as the original ... very nice production!

This is a press your luck filler and this one actually doesn't involve dice.

In this game there is an adventurer in the center of the table with several pieces of equipment.  This equipment does different things like give the hero more HP or defeat certain monsters.  On a players turn they either pass removing themselves from the round or they draw a monster card and either add this monster to the dungeon or they remove one of the pieces of equipment from the adventurer.

Once all but one player has passed they need to defeat all the monsters in the dungeon with the equipment left.  Two failures eliminates a player from the game and a player wins after two successes or if all other players are eliminated.

This is a great filler.  It's easy to teach, super quick, and actually has interesting decisions.  Each time you add a monster to the dungeon or remove a piece of equipment you put yourself at risk of tackling an unbeatable dungeon on your next turn.  At the same time though it's difficult to win via elimination so you want successful runs and the only way to stay in the game is by adding a monster or removing equipment.

Fun, accessible, and quick filler with nice colorful artwork.

Cute push-your-luck filler. Players take turns either adding monsters to the dungeon or setting them aside; setting one aside requires discarding one of the hero's pieces of equipment. The last player left in takes the hero and either beats the monsters or dies. The first to win twice (or the last left when others have died twice) wins.

I have minimal interest in push-your-luck fillers, but it's not a bad one. Compared to similar titles: it's light years ahead of Gauntlet of Fools, but I would probably prefer to play Dungeon Raiders.

Very simple 10-15 minute game where players send in 1 of 4 unique adventures and their remaining equipment into a dungeon full of monsters set forth by the players.  On a players turn they may either add a face down monster card to the dungeon, discard a monster card along with a piece of the adventurers equipment, or pass their turn.  Once all but 1 player has passed the remaining player must then try to make it through the dungeon by defeating the monsters that were played face down.  To win the game a player must either make it through the dungeon twice or be the only surviving player.  The sweet spot for this game is 3 players.

A game which is underrated in my opinion.  It doesn't deserve any top 10s or major awards, but it is still a fun simple  game with a great theme, great art, and two of my favorite mechanics: press your luck and bluffing.  

The game's biggest flaw is that it often feels a bit too random/unpredictable since you don't even have the slightest clue what the other players are drawing from the deck.  This would bother me much more in a heavy game, but this game is a light game and so you really don't need to get invested in it.

Not my cup of tea. There are many games in both the lightweight dungeon exploration category. Likewise, there are many games in the Princess Bride category of deduction exercises ("But then I know that you know I know you know!"). Here we have a game that is one part push-your-luck and two parts trying to fake your opponents out. The core mechanic feels like "Name That Tune," but in the sense that you can also sabotage your opponents. It's quick and it's good for a few laughs, but there is precious little control to be had, and I felt more like I was playing a gimmick than a fully developed game. The illusion of control comes from believing you know what everyone else has done -- but of course it's typically no better than a guess. For something goofy, I'll play when asked -- but not more than a few rounds.

Welcome to the Dungeon is basically a game of chicken with a dungeon crawling theme. You start with a bunch of gear that makes it easy to defeat monsters and each players' turn either adds a monster the dungeon (with only that player knowing which) or removes a piece of equipment from the round. The last player to pass goes into the dungeon with whatever equipment is left and fights as many monsters as were added. The equipment varies as you can use a warrior, wizard, cleric, etc. When you go into the dungeon you either succeed or fail. Two fails and you are out of the game. Two successes and you win the game.

I like the idea and the theme of this game, but it kind of failed for me. Mostly because it's a highly random game of chicken, but also because there is player elimination and the game goes longer than I would like.

RATING: 8.6
I like 'push your luck' games, but usually I don't enjoy them as much as I do this one. One of the primary reasons why is because of the set number of cards, and the fact that every player has insider information, which makes for great table tension. Did someone put the dragon in? Who knows it's in there? Why did that player pull out? Are they expecting me to go or trying to keep me in? It's almost push your luck combined with bluffing and deduction. 

The ability to make the mission harder for everyone is also very fun. You could be removing it knowing it poses no risk, or to sabotage the mission. But the other players have to try and deduce your motives.

Amazing game.

A good alternative to Skull. My only issue, compared to Skull, is that this seems to be best with exactly three players whereas Skull is better with more players. With four players the game can take quite a bit longer, the dungeon and hero can change quite a bit before you get back to your turn, and if one person gets eliminated early they might have to wait around for a while.

Still, really fun and unique game.

This sort of game just doesn't work very well with two, and with four you have a lot less information to go on. It oddly feels just right with three.

I really wanted to like this.  Other people have said it better than me with ratings near mine.  There's not really any bluffing involved.  The moment you take 1 equipment away, everyone else passes and you go in the dungeon and lose.  You have to have nearly no monsters in the dungeon to win it.  Our 3 player game ended with 1 person passed enough that the other players died, so he won by default.  I will try this as 2 player and I bet it'll be a solid 4, MAYBE 5, but for now, 3 in BGG standards sounds perfect for this game.
Not worth your time.  Too complex for beginners and too swingy for veterans.

A surprisingly fun push-your-luck game when you take turns seeding a dungeon deck. You can, in secret, place easy or difficult monsters to face and if everyone passes to you you have to take on the dungeon.

There's not much agency once you're forced into the dungeon, but it's a light and quick enough game where this isn't a huge deal. The player elimination is a bummer, however.

Dungeon of Mandom, oink games

Bluffing, push-your-luck game that operates better with two players. With two people, it is much easier to accurately assess the risk of entering the dungeon. This makes it more fun to take the gamble and try to pass through.

With more than two players, I find that turn order dictates success too much (since rounds are so short). Too often the best strategy seems to be to ruin the chances of passing through the dungeon, then essentially push the person sitting in the wrong seat into the dungeon by passing. This does work out sometimes for the person forced into the dungeon, but not often enough.

The game is not bad with more players, I just find it less exciting. I find that players tend to just barely make it through the dungeon in two player games more often. More than two players tends to yield super-dead or nearly untouched adventurers (less-near deaths). Aggressive bluffing becomes more important with more players if you want to win, as you need to scare people out of the round or lure them into not passing.

If considering this game, I would actually recommend Kobayakawa instead. I think I enjoy the more subtle bluffing. But this is a great option for a filler with quality components.

This is a light filler game. The players are playing a push your luck game, where the progressively make the dungeon crawl harder and harder until everyone drops out, leaving one schlub to attempt the dungeon.

There's an adventurer who has cool stuff and HP's. On your turn you either pass (and your out) or you draw a card (which means you could get stuck doing the adventure). When you draw a card, you either play that monster to the stack of monsters in the dungeon face down, or you discard the card but remove some piece of the adventurer's equipment.

You only know the cards that you've played to the monster stack, so it's never entirely clear how hard the dungeon crawl will be. If you succeed the dungeon you get a point and the game plays to two points. If you fail a dungeon you take a wound and you're knocked out on your second wound. Last man standing is the second way to win.

It's quick and kinda cute. I wouldn't object to this as a filler, but I wouldn't seek it out either.

Bluffing interests me in any game; that Welcome to the Dungeon was said to work well with two made my interest all the more intense in this case. I play a lot of games with just my wife, and I tend to regret the social style games which I love seldom work that way.

However, further investigation of this game prior to playing left me puzzled. Though the rules are simple, the motivation behind decisions was hard to anticipate: if you draw a card, either choice you make, in principle, makes life more difficult for the player who ultimately enters the dungeon. Either you put another monster into the dungeon, or you give that player less monster-slaying equipment. What might tip you one way or another? No review had been able to encapsulate why this worked as a dilemma, just that it did.

I mention all of this, because my initial experiences teaching the game were hard: it was a challenge to sell with it being unclear to me and my fellow players where the fun was in this game.

My early thoughts are that it's about a few particular cards with each hero. For instance, one piece of the mage's equipment automatically kills both the demon (one of the toughest monsters in the game), and the following monster. Being the one to draw the demon, being the one who knows whether it's in the dungeon or not, is huge. So huge it's a challenge to maintaining your poker face. 

Once in a round you might see a power card. It might be less. But to play well - and, what's more to enjoy the game - you need to be ready to act every time you draw a card. Pretend that drawing a feeble goblin arouses emotion. Pretend that the demon is nothing. And keep talking to you opponents. Ask them what they drew. Ask them to explain why they took away a particular piece of equipment.

The game to me, feels less about the dilemma of what to do with cards (there aren't really cases where adding something to the dungeon or not is objectively better or worse), and more to do with the skill of reading counterparts. I've had, from playing this way - from deducing by half-smiles and hesitant comment - a pretty accurate picture on some occasions of what I'd be facing in the dungeon. I've also been wildly wrong on others, but I flatter myself that I'm doing better than I would if I didn't engage with my opponents in this way.

You need to make the bluffing come to life with this one. You need, by extension, other players who get the spirit of this  - that you're trying to read and thwart readings. Those things granted, I've been enjoying this rather a lot.

A very typical and compact Japanese game where players push their luck in dungeon delving. The twist is that players are playing chicken to see who wants to enter the dungeon while simultaneously handicapping their chances to best the dungeon by populating the dungeon with monsters and removing equipment that will help the adventurers. Interesting concept but I see very limited replayability. Good for a few forays and testing the new characters (which is fun!). A very light filler that is good for a specific crowds.

A pretty fun game, you really experience everything there is to experience in 10-15 minutes.  It's a quick push your luck filler.  It has some novel concepts, a fun twist with some nice components and good art.

I feel like it's lacking some variation.  A dozen monster cards you're cycling through, the different hero characters don't change the game up much.  Feel like it's a great setup but it's missing something that could increase player count and make it a bit more dynamic.

Still, the game is definitely enjoyable at the higher player counts.

Pretty fun game, it's got a bit of push your luck, some round-about "take that", and pseudo player powers. Fairly unique and innovative base mechanic for a simple card game. Very good for the 15-20 min game niche it's in, but not as fun as my personal king of the genre: Coup.

Very good, push your luck game. Clever mechanisms where each turn you have to pass or to stay in, make it harder by adding a monster to the dungeon or removing some of the hero adventurer's equipment; and attempts to win the game may fail and eliminate you from the game instead.

Significant improvement on the original Dungeon Of Mandom with four, very different heroes to choose between.

Press your luck isn't something I'm a fan of but this is hardly luck. You have the same deck of cards every time. You know what is in it. It comes down to reading your opponents in a deduction style.

I have a weird relationship with filler games: I want to love them and I’m typically indifferent towards them. This game falls in the indifferent boat for the moment, but I could see it going up once I better understand how to play.

The basic premise is someone is going into the dungeon and attempting to come out alive after defeating all of the monsters. It’s a bit abstract because the players all represent that same person, but only one person is going into the dungeon. Each round a hero is selected and then the players, one at a time, look at a card from the monster deck and either put it in the dungeon deck (meaning the hero will encounter it) or it is set aside along with one of the hero’s six magic items (where the hero cannot use the item, but won’t encounter the monster either). So if you know you don’t want to go on this particular trip, you might draw a weak card, set it aside, and bring a very strong item with it. However, if everyone else passes, you’re stuck going to the dungeon. You’re playing a low stakes game of chicken, essentially.

In that regard, the game is very good. That tension is definitely there and the game is over way before it’s worn out it’s welcome. It has player elimination, but I never have a problem with player elimination with fillers. I’m happy I purchased this game, but I’ll need a few more plays before I actually understand the strategy.

While I think the game mechanic is clever, the game itself is feather-light...lighter even than Love Letter. Also, because it needs a surface to set the components on, it isn't quite as good a travel game (no playing on a train, for example). I can't see myself playing such a light filler very often.

Fast and light-ish, fantasy card game of Chicken or Name That Tune. The remaining player that doesn't blink steps into the dungeon to face a hand picked stack of monsters stocked by the other players AND without some of their best gear. Simple? No. Fun? Yes. At first it is just a matter of who is brave or dumb enough to go in.  After a few rounds the players start to memorize and learn the combinations of gear with monster weaknesses to math crunch their chances of survival. But, there is never perfect information so it is always a calculated hunch at best. First player to score two dungeon successes wins. But, for our family, we are too competitive and can't help stubbornly staying in until it is going to be certain death. Inevitably it becomes the last player not to loose twice that wins. Same in Pinochle. The team that goes set the least.

super light push-your-luck dungeon game in which you eat up your 8 inventory items until you think you can stop and take on the dungeon with what remains. 

Incredibly, this is actually quite complex for the youngling as it looks so very simple.

A press-your-luck game with multiple people. Basically is bragging who will enter the dungeon as it grows more and more deadly.

[i]Welcome to the Dungeon[/i] is a filler, but different from its close cousins.

There are many 'silly' fillers such as Ring-o Flamingo, Coconuts, Get Bit, We Didn't Playtest This At All, and the like.  These games are beloved by daffy adults, heavy drinkers, and cheerful families.

It would be a mistake to put WTTD into the same filler category, since its unusual push-your-luck design (some brain waves required) is more appropriate for hardcore gamers taking a breather between heavier designs.  The fantasy theme will put off "serious" hobbyists, but that's their loss.

I do wish that WTTD could be a tad shorter.  Possibly it's best with three (we played with four) - or perhaps it needs smarter players, in which case our games will never be as short as they could be.

Overall rating:  Recommended, riveting, and graphically appealing.

[i]Update:[/i]

Yes, it's been clarified that the dungeon pile shouldn't be shuffled before entry.  The fun option is always the better option, however, so we shuffle.

Excellent little game. I originally played the Japanese version. This version has more characters. This is a bluffing kind of game. Are you putting weak monsters in the dungeon or strong ones? Can you afford to play another round? Tough decisions.

A light, filler, press-your-luck game that doesn't use dice! Great fun for the 30 minutes it takes to play. Best with three or four, but works with two.

Original score of 7, upgrading to an 8. Our first number of plays were with 4 players, and I felt underwhelmed. Why were so many people lauding this game?

Then we played with 3. Now I get it. Now I get it.

Nice push-your-luck game. I like how you can try to trick another player into running an impossible dungeon or that you can try to bluff people out into letting them think it's an impossible dungeon. The dungeon running them might limit the audience that would like this game, but I haven't really suffered under it :)

Fun filler game. I actually liked it a lot more than I thought I would based on the rules explanation. Navigating the dungeon was fun for all players simply because nobody knew what was in it.  I'd actually rate it higher if it weren't for the "reset" time between rounds - it's a bit reminiscent of Jaipur in that respect, though both the playtime per round and the round reset time for WTTD are a little shorter.

A 2-4 player fast push your luck game. Draw a monster and add it to the dungeon or take a piece of equipment off the central adventurer. Last person to pass has to go into the dungeon with that adventurer. Survive twice and win, but die twice and you're out of the game.

Played at Essen (2015) Quote: "Of course, this is the dragon which I am NOT putting in the dungeon, that's why I am blocking him with the dragon-killing lance!" Secretly laughs an evil-overlord-muhaha.
 
"No, I totally didn't place two of the huge orcs in the dunegon and then removed the only piece of equipment that could have killed them, and then passed before you could."
 
A fast, hilarious bluffing game for 2 to 4. We played with 3 and had lots of fun. There is a hero who wants to go into the dungeon, he's loaded with all kinds of equipment: the dragon killing lance, the goblet that will vanquish all foes with an even-numbered strength, and so on.
 
Then there is the dungeon. Each turn a player has three options: pass, or draw a card and place it in the dungeon, or draw a card and place it in the blocked stack. But you can only block a card by taking a piece of the hero's equipment.
 
A round ends when there is only one player who hasn't passed. This player has to enter the dungeon. Then the other players have fun showing the player which monsters are in the dungeon. Depending on his equipment the hero either emerges victorious or takes a wound.
 
The game ends as soon as one player has successfully completed two dungeons (2 VP) or if only one player is left standing, because the second time a player takes a wound he is removed from the game.

Fun little surprise of a dungeon crawl! We played the tiny Japanese version. Love the design. I'm discovering that I can rather enjoy push-your-luck in games. This feels like it'd be a great warm-up game. Keen to try the beefed-up IELLO version with the different heroes and items.

لعبة خفيفة وجميلة تعتمد على استنفاذ حظك والمخادعة. الفكرة هي أن تنسحب في الوقت المناسب وتتجنب دخول الزنزانة لمقارعة الوحوش إن كنت تعتقد أنه لا حظ للبطل في الفوز، أو في المقابل محاولة خداع الآخرين لكي ينسحبوا ويتركوا لك المجال لتدخل الزنزانة الملىئ بالوحوش الضعيفة التي وضعتها بنفسك!

Gra rywalizacyjna w "chickena". Gracze: 2-4 os. Tłumaczenie: krótkie. Wymagania: żadne. Czas: 1/2-2/3h

Bardzo ciekawa implementacja gry w "chickena" w klimacie Diablo/Warcrafta. Mała, ładne wykonanie. Bardzo szybka, bardzo proste zasady. Świetnie nadaje się na przystawkę. Niezależna językowo.

I really enjoy this game. I like how it packs small but can play pretty big, especially with such a small amount of cards. This game is great though, and feels very much like Poker without having hands. The tense stare downs, the anguish of having a really great item taken away by the bastard friend who wants to stir the pot... it is really cool. Love it! Eventually, I want to get a copy of my own :) I just wish there were maybe different versions with other themes. I saw an excellent fan-made Zelda remake of this, and it blew me away.

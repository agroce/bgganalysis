To me, it's just another command and colors game. I like the system, and I like this iteration of it, and it's got some great "aha!" moments and exciting dice rolls. But I don't find this game, nor the system, to be quite on par for me with the other 2-player games available right now. I'm keeping Memoir '44 for the off chance that I get an urge to play a C&C game in the future but expect that to get replaced within a couple of years as well. Just not as good as the competition anymore.

RATING: 10
I was searching for a long time for a good 2-player skirmish game and after watching some reviews Battlelore seemed just the right one for me. The components did the rest to convince me: absolutely beautiful! Now I can say... I really love this game. The system is simple enough to be easy to teach, but it offers great strategical and tactical choices. It's so interesting for me how important are the movement of your troops, their positioning on the board and the synergy between them. There's so much more skill in this game than how it looks at first sight. 

Yet for sure there's a lot of luck: the dice combat can mess you over, as well as bad drawing. I understand that this randomness is necessary to the game, but it still is my one issue with Battlelore. The reason of this being that the game is not so fun anymore, when one player simply gets annihilated by his/her own bad luck. It doesn't matter whether you are that player or not, because at that point the competition and the tension disappears. Overall though Battlelore is a very good game, that became great with the expansions. The base game really suffered of missing variety, but now I can see myself playing this a whole lot more!

Rating without the expansions: 7.5

Excellent game!  Better than Memoir 44, which uses the same game mechanic.  Highly recommend finding a campaign game.  I found one on BGG, there are probably others out there that can be found with a little effort.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It is a great two-player wargame, based on the ruleset of the previous Memoir game and set in the Runebound-universe. Although the game setup takes up almost half of the playing time, it requires great tactics skills. The randomness is provided by dice-rolling which can be very frustrating when you think you have got a winning strategy. The downside of the game is that there are only two factions battleing each other and only eight scenarios per factions.

RATING: 6
1st Play: I like this game, it uses a similar system to Memoir 44 but in a fantasy setting. I like how the lore builds over time, and how there is a huge variety of units. There were some rules ambiguities that I didn't like, that required frequent consults to the rulebook, but I think after a few plays, it wouldn't bother me and the game would be a lot of fun.

Combat is a lot bloodier in this than in Memoir, and the counterattacks and pursue abilities really make combat dangerous and deadly. Overall, a good game, and will likely get better with familiarity.

2nd play: Played the scenario version with wife. It's a testament to how fun and easy the C&C system is that a non gamer can have good fun with the game. Hard to evaluate the Battlelore parts when playing intro scenario though. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of the best games I have ever played (and I have played many). It is easy to learn, plays fast, makes set up part of the game, and has deep tactics that heavily offset any randomness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not nearly as good as GMT's Commands and Colors games but definitely better than Days of Wonders' game. Pure fantasy works better than the semi-historical original setting. There's a lot more variety in the units too, without being completely unbalanced (dwarves vs goblins).

Excellent 2 players, I had my eye on Memoir 44, but decided to take my chances with Battlelore first to get to know the system, as fantasy is more in tune with our taste, and I haven't regreted a bit. Some peolle mentioned the long setup, bu we enjoyed it a lot as it is part of the game. the game in itself is fast and the minis are great.

RATING: 8.5
Really fun game. Scratches the same itch that Warhammer fantasy does, but much less work and time to play this one. Simpler than WFB of course, but fun. The only complaint I have so far is that it seems to me that Hernfar are better than the Uthuk. The expansion Warband of Scorn Army Pack is boring I think. Would have been more fun if there were more daemon units in the expansion pack, instead of boring wimpy evil humanoid types with strange and rather complicated skills. Grotesque is really boring. The Doom bringer is fun though.

Like a light miniatures game. They've got everything right in this game.

This game is somewhat more straightforward and quicker to learn than first version, but not all changes are good. The sides feel a bit unbalanced, greater mobility of Daqan is in many scenarios more useful than brute force of Uthuk. Rules aren't clear in many special situations, and terrain feels to have lost most of it's role on battlefield.

RATING: 10
This has been a favorite and love at first play. The army building and deployment aspect takes some time but is a satisfying pregame. Lots of fun strategy during the game and with well-matched players never fails to tell an amazing story. I've had a lot of edge-of-my-seat victories and defeats. 

Very solid rule book and reference book. Awesome components. 

Played about 15-20 games before starting to log plays and expect to hang on to this indefinitely. Will buy any future expansions, too (hoping for elf army next).

I own the first edition which is a thousand times better.
I also don't like being lied to. They claimed that they were forced to stop supporting the first edition because it was impossible to reprint the base game without it costing less than 80$ which they considered excessive. 2 years fast forward and ffg has 2 boardgames at that price and Great War Commander with almost the same number of minis costs about €75. Ffg is completely unreliable in this regard.

On the strategic part: there had never been a non siege battle in medieval history that has been decided by controlling specific points in the battlefield. This is modern era warfare only. This is an answer to fools that don't like the first edition because it is "unrealistic".

This game suffers from the same liability for us as Battle Cry. We really don't need more than one Commands & Colors game. Granted this one is getting the content added to it on a regular basis thanks to Fantasy Flight. As much as we like fantasy, we prefer the real world scenarios of Memoir '44. Plus the way the combat in addition to the magic works , BattleLore 2.0 doesn't flow as easily in game play as Memoir. But if you like skirmish combat and you are a fantasy fan this is certainly the C&C game for you.

RATING: 8.5
Maybe it's the fantasy trappings,the story-evoking lore cards combined with some really simple processes for moving and attacking that makes this a game that is just fun. The word simple has been used a lot, but I feel that it's a dangerous word. The method for making decisions isn't convoluted with a ten pound rule book. Without convoluted sub-rules, the choices you have before you each turn are simple. The specific choices you make are the hard part and that is exactly what I want from a war game or ANY game for that mattter.

P.S. Had to sell this because it was hard to justify just a 2 player game at game nights. Also, the cool, but expensive army expansions were too much of a temptation to avoid.

Battlelore is a great light game.  The components are excellent.  The rule book is well written.  I am not sure why Fantasy Flight waited so long to release expansions. I am glad they finally did.  If you are interested in the commands and color system this would be my top recommendation.  There are many great games in the system. If you do not like the fantasy theme try Memoir 44 (World War II).

RATING: 9
After 10 plays...this game is pretty solid. I never played the original. With the right opponent this is nail-biting and fantastic. Seems that the game balance may be swayed slightly and I mean just slightly toward the blue side. The blue team (the good guys) have some really cool powers and some impressive ranged attacks. Don't get me wrong...the red team is pretty solid but a bunch of their powers and abilities are melee driven. That is great for theme but they tend to get shredded by arrows before they can engage.
Last but not least (Yes it is based on the command and colors system, I know...I get it) your hand can kill you quicker than your enemy if you continue to get unlucky draws. Small complaints aside the game is pretty, has fairly sturdy components, and can scratch your itch for a quick tactical throw-down. Word.

RATING: 7
Több év különbséggel játszottam a két változattal. Emlékeim szerint a régi nem ilyen szép, és néhány dologban más is, de élményre kb. ugyanazt hozza. Sajnos volt pár szabály, amit nem jól játszottunk, és amúgy is csak 1 gyors partira volt időnk. Ez tipikusan az a játék, amit nem lenne szabad 1 menet kedvéért elővenni, legalább 3-4 csatát le kellene játszani egyhuzamban. 1 csata 1 óra, az előkészület+elpakolás is van összesen vagy fél óra. Nekem a C&C jobban tetszik továbbra is, letisztultabb, és itt most voltak olyan (lovas)kártyáim, amikhez nem tartoztak egységek, ezért csak 1 egységet tudtam utasítani. C&C-ben ez nagyon ritkán fordul elő. A Memoirban is pont ez volt ami zavart minket.

A fentieket leszámítva van létjogosultsága ennek is a C&C és a Memoir mellett, egyrészt az eltérő téma, és a Lore rendszer miatt. Meg a titkos seregfelpakolás is tetszik.

BattleLore 2nd ed. is an easy, quick and smooth fix of good ol' fantasy wargaming. Just when I needed it…

The game is another iteration of the Command & Colors system (possibly the best introductory light wargame rules system out there), but there is a couple of great tweaks in BL2: the scenario generator instead of fixed scenarios from a scenario book is an awesome idea (each army has 7 deployment/scenario cards: from a hand of three, each player secretly selects one, then both reveal and the map is built and the special rules read); the point system, instead of typical kill'em all, makes for an exciting game of maneuvering.

Production wise, it is classic FFG: great components, awesome minis. Rulebook is not classic FFG: clear, concise and straightforward. Thumbs up.

I am really excited to play it again, and can't wait for the inevitable expansions!

RATING: 7
Easily the best of the C&C series I have played. Not only does it streamline some of the rules but I love being able to buy your units, choose a terrain set for your side of the board and the focus on location objectives for points (vs. picking off units). But one of the most overlooked improvements are in the command cards themselves which are less frustrating than in other games I have played in this series. (ie. no probe cards, more multi-area cards etc.). With the way they have built the command deck it always felt like you had useful cards and there was no "obvious" choice to play. Likewise getting stuck with an unlucky set (ie. 5-6 cards for a flank you are weak on) just doesn't seem possible.

Maybe the best implementation of Borg's Command and colors system? Takes awhile to set up but there's some strategy to that part too. The basic game works well, but the Lore cards played shake things up from getting too predictable.

This has a lot more going on than M44. It kind of takes that system and mashed it with a wargame like Warhammer. You have points to decide your army, you choose the placement, you even choose what the layout of your side of the board it. Almost too much flexibility for my taste (I like when those decisions are made for me and I have to manage with what is given).

RATING: 7
I have played through en entire campaign, an ad-hoc "Epic" battle with a friend, and many standalone games. I've boosted my rating to an 8 because it is a solid game in the vein of Richard Borg's many other C&C titles and expansions.

If there's a flaw, it will be in the way the Lore Cards, Unit Abilities, and Components, interact. There are countless abilities and card effects and it is rarely clear how one stacks up against the other. (Can the Unstoppable Lore Card overrule the Vigilant Ability? Why or why not?) This can lead to game-halting rules-flipping and discussion. That's never fun.

But being a fan of all things Richard Borg, I would not have missed the chance to jump in and see for myself. I appreciate that expansions for U'thuk and the Daqan are forth-coming, but a chance to to tie this game with RuneWars through the introduction of factions for the Elves and Undead is not being taken at the moment. 

Could be there are bigger plans down the road. I hope so!

This game makes a GREAT first impression!
Unfortunately this game is all flash and no substance.
Within five or so plays you'll grow bored of it.
The game is all pretty and "ooh shiny" at first glance, but you'll soon realize that playing this game is like eating a plate of nothing but condiments. Condiments can definitely enhance a meal, but they can't be a meal.

I MUCH prefer Commands & Colors: Ancients over this.

A couple points:
- The aesthetics of this game are amazing! Unfortunately that's about the only compliment I can give it.
- The setup time is REALLY long for how short the game is. (and that's without any of the expansions)

RATING: 8
Probably the best C&C implementation I've played and I think it's a great system- almost an essential light 2P tactical "war game" system.  There's a lot of fun in the base game but after about 10 plays in three days I'm already anxious for more- more armies, more units, more everything.  If this becomes a huge game system with tons of armies and units and campaigns and so on it will definitely go up to a 10 for me.  Here's hoping it's well supported- knowing FFG it will be.

2017  Lots to like about this game.  The components are top notch - thick board and tiles, well sculpted minis, nice dice.  The rules take the Command and Colors system to the next level, with asymetrical armies, units with unique powers, and a scenario system that allows each player to pick a scenario for their half of the board, allowing for a wide variety of combined scenarios (49 just in the starter box.)  And the game itself is a blast to play. 
***Own Terrors of the Mist, Heralds of Dreadfall, Hernfar Guardians, Warbands of Scorn, and Neutral Mountain Giant, Dragon, and Razorwings expansions as well.

I have at least one of every BL2E product, and I've played them all with great delight. I mourn the evident shuttering of this line (with elves kicked to the curb), because it's really one of the best games I've ever played--by far my favorite tactical combat game.

Victory is defined by mission objectives instead of kill count! The retreat and support rules are also very different from the other C&C games. Dislike the scenario cards, I prefer pre-designed scenarios.

BattleLore v2 is fantastic. My girlfriend and I already love it after our first three skirmishes. We love that it plays fast and focused. Not have owned or played BattleLore v1 we don't really have anything holding us back from jumping into this new edition. My only bone of contention with this game is the slowness of the Uthuk units, which makes it difficult to get into position to nab those all important VPs. Looking forward to additional factions being added to this.

I liked moving my little dolls around the field, thinking about where they would be most effective and what not. And then I rolled dice for resolution whenever I was attacking and felt supremely frustrated.

Random resolution is a feature of games I really don't enjoy.

Finally, considering how much fun Memoir 44 is, this game, as an evolution of that one, is particularly disappointing.

Initial thoughts: The optional rules with the first four  command cards pre-determined are a must for this game to have any strategic value. The rules are not very well-written. A lot of word choices are wrong and some explanations are unnecessary complex to describe simple rules. Of all my games this has been the most unclear rulebook. The set-up with one rulebook and one reference-book is also just an odd choice. Especially with standard rules described in the reference book and no explanations of special situations anywhere.   

Comparing the two different armies the Daqan army seems to be more powerful with better abilities. The Uthuk have some good abilities also but they tend to rely on special situation and luck much more. However this seems to be balanced by the set-up scenarios with the Uthuk having a lot easier taking VP. The scenario Blood in the Water is way too good for example to have a balanced game.  

With two equal players the one who draws the right cards and are lucky with dice rolls will win. This is why I much prefer eurogames. Was actually looking out for a wargame without dice (Kemet) but was unable to find it.    

Completely retarded storage. Needs a proper solution. Why is there no insert?  

Nice components and minis. Long set-up time but at least it is gamified. 

Not recommended.

RATING: 7
BattleLore second edition is a game like Memoir ’44 and Commands & Colors: Ancients, but it does have some differences. The main reason is the way you score points which is very different to C&C, and it’s actually probably a little more euro-y because you don’t get points when killing units, but for holding specific areas on the board (though certain scenarios may dictate other ways to earn points). Speaking of these scenarios, it was very cool that you each choose one part of scenario/board and you then put the two together to form the gameboard for that particular game (and choose what you earn points for)! After setting up the board you also choose which units you are actually going to play with and where to place them (you use decoy cards so the other player doesn’t know until you’re both ready). That’s so cool!

The movement cards are quite basic, but I like the special cards as well as the mana card you can buy each round. I have to say, though, that because you get points for controlling areas, the scores are usually very close, and I cannot see that a player can win a major victory simply because you both are likely to get 1-2 points each round. Of course that can also be called a pro as both have a chance to win, but it’s just hard to pull away from your opponent and win a decisive victory. This actually meant that I lost a game I probably should have won. Even though you can play well, there is a big luck aspect due to the random card draws and roll of the dice. I lost a game when a single army unit made 3 hits on 3 dice which was quite unlikely, and at the same time I rolled a bunch of misses which would have sealed the deal. Furthermore I only got a single “right flank” card during the entire game, and due to how the board was set up, all of the points were at that flank – so I ended up spending at least three turns playing a regular movement card to move just a single unit. That’s hardly effective! It just felt a little anticlimactic as I only lost by a single point, but then again, in my other game I felt like I had the upper hand the entire time and only won by 3, so the games seem to be always close no matter what.

If I didn’t already own C&C, I would probably buy this as the two games don’t feel too similar because of the cool plastic figures/theme/mainly the way you score points.

I picked up Battlelore after already playing Memoir '44 and C&C: Ancients, so I was already a fan of the system. I was attracted to the fantasy theme and the fact that setup is now integrated into the game.

After one play, this delivered as expected. I love the unit abilities, and this provides something more complex than M44 without all the dizzying unit differences of C&C: Ancients. I look forward to playing this more.

Update: up to four plays now, and this is a candidate for a 10, particularly once I have the chance to customize with some of the expansions.

So Fantasy Flight buys Battlelore and does nothing with it for a few years, then busts out this second edition version placing it in their Terrinoth universe.  Is it better than the first edition?... I don't know, however I like the streamlined rules and setup, army mustering is flexible and allows you to adopt your style of play. The scenario cards are interesting in that you match your card to your opponents card to create the scenario, making for ALOT of possible combinations.  Combat has been simplified, the games play quickly and smoothly.  Overall a-lot of fun.

My favorite of the commands and colors games from Richard Borg. That is saying a lot because I really enjoy all of the ones I've got to try so far. Amazing components and nice variety in the setup and army building. Really amazing heads up 2 player game with just the right amount of randomness to keep the game interesting; but the player with better strategy will be at a big advantage. Between the ups and downs of the dice and card distributions there is always excitement, even if you fall behind.

Recently sold.

There are those that will love the additional card play and miniatures but of the numerous other titles that use the C&C engine that I own and have played this is by far my least favorite.  I would venture to say it should probably just be called "Lore" as that is one of the most important mechanics in the game.  No victory points for destroying enemy units (outside of specific scenario textual effects) really sealed the deal for me.  This one will probably collect dust on my shelf.  Fortunately someone unloaded it on me for free so I'm not out anything :)

It's pretty great and in spite of not owning any of the army expansions this has given me many hours of joy. Great rules, very quick, and the best version of the Command & Colours system for those new to this style of game.

Really enjoyed this game. Similar to Commands and Colors Ancients but with some interesting variations. The game adds the concept of 'lore', which is essentially an additional deck each player has to manage in the game to achieve extra in game effects. Quite a cool addition. The variable initial setup and fog of war (implemented through decoys) is also a nice variation that adds tactics to the initial setup. It has clearly been designed with balance in mind. The combat system is also much simpler than Commands and Colors Ancients (i.e. terrain rules, support/retreat are much easier). 

Rated as 9.5 on a par with Commands and Colors after 3 more plays. I really like the scenario building mechanism, the fog of war created by the army muster process and the additional elements added by the lore decks.

The simplicity of the Commands and Colours system mixed with the deep strategy of learning every unit and how they play off of each other yields an amazing experience every play. The artwork is gorgeous, the theme is rich throughout, and it doesn't hurt that it's a hell of a lot of fun! One of my favourites.

Had fun with on the first few scenarios. Still a lot to discover. I hadn't played BLv1, but I had played a bunch of M44 scenarios, and even with the base game of M44, it seems to have more bells & whistles in terms of scenario construction. But for some reason I find myself enjoying BL a bit more. I haven't played M44 in a long time, and perhaps absence makes the heart grow fonder? Perhaps less asymmetry of scenarios? I like that BL has scenario construction based on 2 cards, one for each half, and you can mix and match. 

I gotta find an FAQ though. Lots of corner cases came up tha I couldn't figure out from the rules. I also detest FF's approach to rules writing with a loose intro, and then a reference glossary with details. You basically have to read the glossary, but there's no flow to it, so it's a total slog.

A really great lightweight war game! The plethora of scenarios, and the custom setup increase replayability a lot and make the game more flexible. The tutorial and rules reference are very well-written and help you understand really fast the rules. The rules are pretty clear; One thing that was a bit fuzzy for me was the line of sight which got clarified after watching some examples of play in youtube and reading some threads in BBG forum. If you are already familiar with Command & Colors games, you will probably have no problem at all with it. The duration of the game doesn't take so long, it depends on the scenario though and the familiarity with the game. The first games are a bit heavy when you start playing it, but since you have played your first 4-5 games and have a good picture of the different command cards, lore cards and army abilities then everything goes smooth! Miniatures are really amazing! I have painted all of them for the core game and I have half painted the ones of Hernfar Guardians and Warband of Scorn Expansions. Really can't wait to bring those guys to the table, which will add even more options! Overall, it is a great tactical/strategic game that is also based on luck. The battle system is based on dice rolls. I'm sure it's not the most fair combat system but adds a little spiciness and suspense in the game. At least I prefer it  more than a system where the result of a battle is totally expected and known in advance. Every time we have played the game we always have a blast! The only drawback is that sometimes the result of the game is known some/several rounds before it ends. But there are times that suspense is there until the final round/action! Moreover the Scenario Builder (https://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/battlelore/) is a very cool tool that can be used to create your scenarios/maps and share them online with other people. In this page you will find really great scenarios. In some of them the setup is standardized so that you can start playing even faster!

I always want to play this game! Really excited! I think that currently is my #1! :)

Most fun game in the system.  They did a great job of bringing the magic and monsters out in the second edition...in the first edition, they were secondary to the medieval feel.

So I never get to play my favorite of the series.

After some plays, eh, it's an ok hex based tactical combat game. It basically uses the Memoir system with some added Lore cards and a few special unit quirks for flavoring, which is fine. While there are some tactical choices with how, when and where to move and fire, overall I don't feel there's a great deal of depth. So, ok to play on Steam or the iPad from time to time, but not something I'm especially interested in playing face to face.

After buying nearly a complete set of Battlelore 1st edition, I found that the 2nd Edition is much more in line with what I hoped to get out of the game.  Some of the improvements:
* Better use of the dice.  The color system made little sense in 1st ed, as each color was only on one face anyway (at least Battles of Westeros made better use of the colors on its d8s).  The 2nd edition dice are much better use of those 6 faces.
* Objective-based point system feels much better to me than the kill-based VPs of 1st ed.
* Random scenario setup with army mustering is much cleaner and variable than the 1st edition, even with the somewhat kludgy Call to Arms expansion.
* Full-on fantasy setting is more cohesive than the historic/fantasy hybrid of 1st ed.  
* I REALLY prefer the new new unit system of just having all the unit stats on the single card.  The colors/weapon based system in 1st edition meant you had to cross reference 2 or 3 different cards to figure out movement and attacks.  Once you added in the expansions, the whole thing became very unwieldy.

As a downside, the game really should have included boards and markers to track lore and VPs.  The token-based system is needlessly fiddly.  I think I may whip up my own, likely ugly but functional, score tracks.

Overall, I like this game a bunch, and it is even more fun than I expected!  A light wargame should be easy to pick up and play, and this fits the bill much better than 1st ed.  If I decide to go for a purer C&C experience, I will pick up ancients.

UPDATE Jan 2014: Loving the game.  I am appreciating the mustering phase.  The units each have their specialties, and tailoring your lineup to the specific scenario combinations is a fun challenge.  With an expansion or two to ensure continued variety, this could become a 10.  I would especially like to see a better campaign system.  Also, they need to sell dice packs (they really should have included more dice in the box).

I've had a lot of fun with this one and after only 3 plays I am thinking I want to go all in on this one and pick up all the expansions. The setup is a little lengthy but to me it's almost a game in itself as you are trying to out think your opponent is how you are going to build your army for your drawn scenario. The cards can definitely turn against you and give you poor options but sometimes the battle just is not going to go your way. Has made me a even bigger fan of the Terinoth universe created by Fantasy Flight.

Playing Battlelore 2ED is a pure pleasure. Fast paced fantasy wargame, with random map builder and plenty of cleaver rules. Easy to learn but very deep. Dice are great, of course a lot of randomness, but can be controled by playing lore cards in right moments.

A neat, superlight two-player wargame that looks gorgeous on the table. I like the fact that it has simple rules, but there are still many decisions to be made, from drawing lore cards or just lore, which units to activate, etc. Just right up my alley.

A great game for beginner strategy/wargamers, or for more serious wargamers who want to take a day off for some lighter fare and quick games. Easy to play, lots of possible actions, and a ton of replayability.

The game improves (in my opinion) on other command and colors games I've played such as Battle Cry and Memior '44. The improvements are greater diversity of unit abilities, easily customizable armies instead of an emphasis on scenarios with set rosters, and the battle lore dynamic in which "misses" build up to provide you with tactical advantages later in the game.

Components are high quality with linen cards and heavy cardstock, tons of miniatures are included, and the art is just the high quality execution that I've come to expect from Fantasy Flight Games.

I tend toward wargames of all types and strategy games, but I can also appreciate lighter games such as Bohnanza. This game instantly made my personal top 10 list.

I'm not even sure if I can competently rate BattleLore. Before each game I'll be on fire with visions of epic battles and glorious victories. As we set up the game, drafting armies and secretly choosing scenarios, my mind is ablaze with the strategic possibilities. I map out a game plan, crafting a fighting force that I think will synergize with my strategy.

Then the game begins, and Dawn's troops slaughter my forces, routing them completely. I roll ranged with my melee and melee with my ranged. Before I know it I have three victory points...and Dawn has ten. 

A few weeks will pass, and I will forget the ignominy perpetrated against me, and the cycle will begin anew.

RATING: 6.5
I really enjoyed this skirmish game.

Whilst it still sticks to the principles of battlelore with the movement order cards they can all be discarded to move a single unit of the board somewhere so they are never a dead card. 

The set up cards for each faction are really nice as every game will be different as both armies have differing objectives that they wish to achieve.

The human army is a bit squishy but it moves really fast whereas the daemons are more lumbering and slow but hit really quite hard, the armies themselves are customisable as you play with 50 points made up from whatever you wish to include and deployment is over 18 hexes with several decoy cards thrown in so your opponent doesn't know exactly where any of your guys are going to begin the game.

It is a little disappointing that all the units have the same chance of hitting any other unit (melee attacks)as the original battlelore had a nice scaling on the dice which mean more elite units were more difficult to harm with your novice units. In this version everything rolls looking for the same face of the die.

It is set for an expansion already (elves and undead) as the art work is already in place depicting these units. As it is also set in the runewars world it is possible there is a runewars expansion coming too as there is a golem unit for the humans which doesn't yet feature in runewars.

The best miniatures wargame I have played. I like the Terrinoth setting and as is expected of Fantasy Flight all the artwork and components are great. The miniatures look great and I like the bright colors they have.

It uses the tried and tested command & colors system and adds some cool magic powers into the mix. I like the variable setup and the different feel of the armies.

Only downside of the game is the length and the setup length. Not a real negative but you have to reserve some time to play this.

I've owned and played 1st edition for a number of years now and have been quite interested in 2nd edition for comparison. Finally got to try it! I was surprised that it was quite a bit different than 1st edition. Some of the things I really like is the larger scale, special traits of each unit type, and some of the rules have been generally streamlined for the better.  The dice combat has been modified slightly as well and I think I like how this works more. I wasn't as much a fan of the setup phase as I thought it would be. Unless you play a lot of this, I'm not sure how much my decisions really mattered with where I placed units. In fact, it probably has more to do with where you put your decoys than where your units are placed. I like the asymmetric VP conditions, but the board and unit setup takes such a long time that I found the experience deflating. I much prefer scenario-based setup. I also think I much prefer VPs for destroying units outright rather than gaining VP solely on holding objective points. I get why 2nd edition does this and the asymmetric VP objectives means each player is attacking the other in slightly a different way. But the tension doesn't build in the same way as 1st edition and a couple of missteps and a point lead by one player usually means there's no catching up for the loser. 1st edition always feels like a nailbiter and it's an excellent example of how to do attrition correctly in a battle game. Killing units in 2nd ed. doesn't matter except for generally weakening a player's overall control of the board.  Overall, there's nothing I truly disliked about 2nd edition and in fact there are things I like more in here than 1st edition. But I don't feel any need after playing to get it or even replace my 1st edition. If anything, I'll take DoW's generic fantasy-history setting over FFG's lame Terrinoth universe any day.

This is a great, great game and better than the previous iteration in most capacities. It deserves a place in BGG's top 10.
-------------------------------------------------
My final judgement of this purchase will, as with the original game, depend on further development of the system, new factions and extra mechanics they'll hopefully add on. If they keep putting out more of the same or not release any further expansion I'm sure I'll sell it within a year, after giving it a fair spin. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for many great new expansions (I'm especially eager to see some undead). 
-------------------------------------------------
It seems 2ed is Battlelore done right. Army creation and scenario cards work great. I'm also happy with the four expansions they announced so far. I hope the next thing they release will be additional factions (maybe another core set with rules for Epic play with two boards combined).
I can see myself enjoying this for years to come.
---------------------------------------------
The army expansions for this game are too expensive. Two expansions (one for each faction) together are more expensive than most games. This probably means that I'm out. (Also deck building rules are unsatisfying.)

Tactical board game with a bunch of randomness that can mess your plans up but has such a smooth rules and gameplay that it absolutely doesn't bother me in the least. It doesn't outstay it's welcome and even if a battle lasts for an hour or more, you'll be ready to play another immediately.

Another iteration and refinement of the excellent C&C light wargame system - and with excellent 28mm minis, custom dice, and set in the Runebound world.

I like this edition a lot. I have almost all the expansions of the first edition and I believe that in this edition they have made some progress in the rules. Also the army placement is a very good aspect. You needed an expansion for this in the 1st edition. 
The only thing that i disliked is the game's box. You cannot place anything in that box. Just an empty square thing with no partitions. The quality of Days of wonder was much better.

Depending on how delicately Fantasy Flight handles expansions for this, I think this is my favorite iteration  of the C and C games.

EDIT: with the new army packs, and the undead factions on the way, there's little not to love. The relative weakness of any ranged unit compared to the caster units is the only thing that keeps this from being a 10 for me.

When compared to 1st ed., I miss the war counsel, but like the diversity that individual lore decks create. Set-up can be cumbersome, but the design allows for easy integration of new units and scenarios. In the end, I like the direction that FF has taken a game that I truly enjoy. I was happy to see the undead and was looking forward to seeing more factions (elves possibly). This is the right direction for BattleLore. Unfortunately, I am saddened to see the game apparently morph into Runewars.

A worthy entry in Richard Borg's column card command system. Battlelore adds some of Fantasy Flight's spins with numerous fantasy races detailed miniatures. It also adds "lore." Lore is a resource used to cast spells and special abilities. There is a bit more to this than Memoir '44 and could appeal more to the right crowd, but I prefer the WWII theme of Memoir and its fewer tweaks to the base rule set.

wargame borg engine. mejora algunos defectos de sus antecesores (como memoir 44) y es muy vistoso, con unas minis de plastico excelentes.

ya lo tiene bastante expandido: 

- expansion de ejercito para humanos
- expansion de ejercito para "bestias" 
- DOS expansiones de ejercito de "no muertos" (un bando que no venia de serie con el juego)
- TRES expansiones de unidades neutrales (alascortantes, gigantes y un dragon)

a mi me parece una animalada y un desperre espectacular. ya me parecia desperre el memoir... :S

Extremely promising. Once in a blue moon (no pun intended), FFG can actually take a good design and tweak it. The new setup rules are amazing, prolonging the setup only slightly but making it much, much less tedious. I'm not a huge fan of the new support rules, but it's a necessary concession to the new design--and it does encourage a certain amount of maneuver and outflanking.

This was surprinsingly good.. i actually don't like the C&C Carddriven System, but in Battlelore they implemented a good chunk of rules to mitigate that "oh.. i can't do anything because my cards suck" moment.

E.g. you draw 6 cards & discard 2 of them BEFORE building your army.. that means you can easily plan ahead for 4 turns.

Wich brings us to the next neat feature, the building of your army.. there is some serious strategy you can apply now. Where do i put my troops? What will i hold? Wich troops will i use for what objective? How many points will i not spend & instead take lore points for? etc.

And finally the magic.. felt pretty balanced & spices things up. Lore point management was also nice, do i take two points, one & a card, or 2 cards & discard one..

Light while being flashy & quick enough.
Hope the expansions will be as good. Good job.

I love these more simple war games (I usually don't have time or patience to throw myself into the multiple hour long proper wargame sessions). The reason I bought this one was the fact it's a proven form of war gaming for two players re-themed to be placed in the realm of Terrinoth. So it's an older game that came originally with a different theme. It's hard to say which one of these editions is better, for me it was Terrinoth that got me hooked. I haven't played this yet.

Being a huge [gameid=10630] fan—and thus predisposed to liking the Commands and Colors (C&C) system in general—it was a great disappointment when the original [gameid=25417] (1st Edition) fell flat for me.  Everything I liked about C&C was there, but, man—the theme was tepid.  I only got a handful of plays out of it and never bought any of the expansions...

When this came out, it wasn't even a vague shadow on my radar.  And then the whole Terrinoth retheme—[i]ugh[/i].

So if I didn't like the original and I'm not a Terrinoth fan, why the hell would I give this an 8?

[b]BECAUSE IT'S [i]AWESOME[/i], THAT'S WHY[/b]

Seriously, it's a GREAT GAME.  The change from "kill 'em all" to "hold ground/secure the objective" is HUGE.  We lose the weird, gamey moments in which an entire army wheels to engulf a single solitary unit at the periphery in order to cross the win-threshold and instead we get a tense back-and-forth, rain-arrows-and-push fantasy wargame feel.  We get strategy and tactics and real maneuvering for position.

The whole Terrinoth thing fades into the background, leaving a plethora of unique unit abilities that must all be taken into account for combined arms synergy, as well as understanding how your abilities will interact with those of the enemy, for good and ill.  It's bewildering and heady at first... but once things click the armies get [i]dangerous[/i].

The way armies are mustered and scenarios built is [i]genius[/i]—with seven different scenario cards for each army we have 49 unique plays [i]just in this box alone[/i].  As the inevitable expansions hit (a Good Thing) this number will quickly crank into the realm of the Functionally Infinite.*

UPDATE:

[q="Chris Tannhauser"][size=12][b]Lady Luck Is a Carnivore...[/b][/size]

...and we are all of us made of meat.  [i]Deren thought of the oft-repeated line, a favorite of one of his sergeants at battle school, as he sat his horse across from what looked for all the world like the host of hell vomited into the dawn.  The barbarians had been up all night, howling, drumming, dancing, burning things—keeping Deren's men from their rest—and now as the sun lanced between mountain peaks he could see something horrible and huge rising unsteadily in the dung-fire haze of the enemy's camp.

The line wavered.

"Hold!" bellowed Deren, "Await the banners and trumpets!"

The horses shied and stamped as the riders faked their courage through the reins.

Deren turned to the new Lord Commander, the replacement for the one that got beheaded the previous week.  "It's not just men this time, sir.  New orders for the line?"

The Lord Commander shifted in his tooled-leather show-saddle, stroking his chin absentmindedly.  "We'll do—" he waved a hand, "—the usual.  If things change I'll let you know."

"Sir—"

"I'm sure something will come to me.  It's in the hands of the gods now."  He shrugged and pointed skyward.

Deren stared.[/i]


[url=http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4742]***[insert thousand-word strategy article about not relying on the luck of card draws & die rolls here]***[/url]


[i]"Banners!" the Lord Commander shrieked.

The boys let them fly and the wind took them, unfurling to snap this way and that.

Deren thought of that old sergeant, a slight man with a hatchet-altered smile, left-handed by circumstance.  "If you lean on Her, boy, She'll bite just as soon as kiss ya—but it's not the kisses you'll remember."  He would gesture with what was left of his master hand and laugh, a dark gurgling not unlike the sounds coming from the host arrayed against them.

The hunched men and worse things loped at them laughing—[/i]laughing[i]—and with the warble of the trumpets Deren put the spurs to his mount and replaced his prayers with steel in his fist.[/i][/q]

Mein liebstes Zweipersonenspiel. Leider etwas abhängig davon welche Kommandokarten man zieht. Selbst der synchrone Spielaufbau der beiden Feldhälften macht irre Spaß! Und die Machtkarten bringen noch zusätzliche Würze zu den ohnehin schon coolen Sonderfähigkeiten der einzelnen Einheiten!

Fun game, though Memoir 44' does it a tad bit faster (lore can slow the game down, but I do like how units retreat opposite of the attack and not just back to their edge of the map) (as of 11/08/2017).

Really good fun. The lore cards can be ridiculously powerful sometimes, and in combination with a potent order card can completely flip the direction the game is taking, which might frustrate the more serious tactical gamer. But for everyone else, me included, it's huge fun.

This is a great 2-player light war game.  Set-up feels a little involved and lengthy, but the actual skirmish can be done in under an hour, lending itself well to quick games or repeat games over an evening.  FFG components are first-rate (as we've come to expect) and the game looks awesome when in full swing.  I have only played with the base box, but the expansions and the new undead faction look fun.

RATING: 8
A truly awesome two-player game. It can take a bit of time, and it can seem rules heavy, but once everyone knows what they're doing, a game can be done in about an hour. The game looks intimidating but it really isn't at all. The Commands & Colors system is very easy to learn, but provides enough strategy and tactics with card play and how you muster your troops.

My only gripe is I wish it came with 4 armies in the box, just for replay-ability purposes. You get a bunch of content for what you pay for. What pisses me off is FFG for not releasing more content for this game. WHAT THE HELL FFG! Seriously this happens with games that don't have the "Arkham," "Eldritch," "Star Wars," or "Descent" franchise keywords, FFG just won't support it. The kicker is this game takes place in the Terinoth universe...the same as Descent! Seriously FFG, you've already increased all your prices on everything, and we are still willing to give you money for more armies. Get your thumbs out of your asses and support this great game.

Update: Wound up trading this one away, due to FFG dropping it and wasting time with Rune Wars(which by the way is getting the much requested Elf army...typical) and decided to pick up Memoir 44' to replace it, since there is  a wealth of expansion content and it's the same system as BattleLore. So disappointing FFg, poor form indeed.

Excellent use of the C&C system, might even be my favourite. Manages to streamline the rules considerably, without losing any of the detail. Terrain, movement and attacking, retreats, everything is clear and straightforward, with plenty of room for units to have individual flavour. VP system is good, Lore abilities are great. Scenario card system is genius. Plays quickly. A bit of a home run really. Only thing missing is EXPANSIONS to flesh out the army building.

And now the expansions are here!

I like how it's like table-top wargaming, but simplified. I found myself not needing to read a book every time I wanted to attack with a lowly knight. The Lore and Command cards are unique, as are the unit abilities. I like that, like Stratego, there's an element of surprise in what you put out at the beginning of the game. They don't stay hidden like in Stratego, but it's still fun to set up your army in secret and use decoys to trick the other player. Can't wait to play this game more!

So far I'm not sure if I like it. The one thing I do like is the scenario generation system. The main annoyance I have with other C&C games is the prevelance of historical one sided scenarios. While I like historical scenarios, their often one sided nature is a definite minus from a gameplay standpoint. 

The nature of combat resolution in Commands and Colors games is already a pretty swingy affair. The Left, Center, Right command system combined with a combat resolution system that often sees you rolling just a couple dice with less than 50% chance to roll successes on each one makes for a lot of luck in a game. I feel like C&C Ancients manages to usually still feel like a fair game despite these mechanics. I'm not sure I can say the same about Battlore 2e.

I haven't nailed down everything that I dislike but a couple of things I find frustrating are:

1) Lore cards and another huge layer of luck on top of everything else. They range from back breaking to decent to absolutely useless (many of them only work for specific units which may or may not be alive or even in your army at all). I like that you get the mana to use the cards from what would otherwise be whiffed die rolls but I feel like the cards are too swingy.

2) The blue cavalry seem way too good. The fact that they add a die to every unit attacking enemies that they are adjacent to (even if they are not themselves activated!) is already really good. Adding the ability to not be battle backed against just makes them seem broken.

I'm still holding out hope that this game will be good but so far it just feels extra swingy and imbalanced and i'm quickly tiring of it. I'm not sure it will survive much longer.

One part-play only, so tentative opinion, but I like it.

Streamlined entry into the command and colours world. The core C&C system is pretty simple so I like that here the focus is on not cluttering the basics (the unit differentiation is on the unit cards and the dice, rather than a bundle of charts) while adding new levels of decision making. Good new things: the players control how victory points are to be won and how the map looks, and the magic / lore system allows the players to boost turns and keep each other on their feet.

I'm not normally a fan of fantasy settings, but the over-the-top, almost cartoony units and the dramatic gameplay seem to suit the fantasy world better than they would a historical battle.

Nice addition for RUNEWARS in a tactical game. This system beats the rest of the C&C series all to hell, especially "Memoir 44'" (sucks total ass). You can always do SOMETHING in THIS game as you can ditch a card to move any unit and weak units are reduced in attacks = 2 things Memoir is sorely lacking. The APP is even better (amazingly better and should be retro-fitted to the ENTIRE C&C system) on how you use the cards so I adapted it to use in this version.

BattleLore 2nd edition is an impressive tabletop miniatures game. The rules blend strategy, tactics, and luck smoothly and in ways that make sense. Choosing a scenario, mustering your army, and setting up your initial position is a big part of the game. The mechanics highlight battlefield tactics and combat strategy, and unit abilities enhance these aspects of the game. The lore system and cards add elements of surprise to the mix. Great components and high-quality production provide the final touches for an incredible tabletop minis experience.

Won my first game of this today as the Daquan Lords with an army consisting of the Roc Warrior, 4 x Citadel Gaurds, 2 x Citadel Lancers, 2 x Rune Golems, 2 x Barricades and a command tent.

We played the scenario where if I control both of my victory conditions with undamaged units I receive an extra victory point. It also aloud me to place barricades and if a unit stops on that space would receive a damage.


On my right flank just in front of one of the victory points I placed both the barricades and sent Rune golems and 2 x Citadel Gaurds.
Then on the left flank I had 2 x Citadel Lancers and 1 x Rune Golem which I sent the cavalry onto the victory point on the first turn.
Then down the centre I had my Roc Warrior to threaten either flank and I used it to attack both flanks and fly back to the centre afterwards with 2 x Citadel gaurds as reinforcements on the lines between centre and flank.

My Opponent also fielded a command tent on his right side to which I destroyed with a set of cavalry who survived 1 legend and 1 full unit of blood harvesters attacks which was amazing!

Competent and playable version of BattleLore in FFG's Terrinoth setting.  We knocked out the campaign in an afternoon and had a decent time with it.  The differences between the two armies remind me of Warcraft, where there is a rough similarity in roles (footman, archer, cavalryman, etc.), but the actual units have meaningfully different abilities.  Game is much improved by the army expansions as they add a lot of depth and customization which is just not present in the original box.

Similar to its older brother but not, IMHO, quite as good. The board and models are bigger. The models are more detailed but I prefer the look of the old game. The dwarves and goblins in that edition look more tongue in cheek where here everything is more real and more dark.

I also prefer preset scenarios and points for killing a unit. Here you have to make your own board based on a draw of three cards each and you get points for holding certain tiles.

It has three different factions that are complete one of them being the undead not exactly the hoped for plethora of factions. You pretty much have three complete factions in the old game

The simple combat system, highly variable objectives, and high level of army building (and units which feel very different), make this a superb game, one of the very few Amerithrash games I enjoy. I particularly enjoy the dice committing mechanism for units to use some dice result as something else: opens up a lot of design room. When this game will have more factions, my love for it will only go up. NB: We play with commands cards being drafted a la Ticket to Ride instead of drawn, takes away a large part of the luck factor in the card draw, which can lead to very limiting play, which is no fun.

Though Lore Decks and unit special abilities are adding an interesting layer, simplified terrain rules and smaller unit sizes make it tactically lighter and more unpredictable than C&C Napoleonics, but faster and bloodier. Still a very good game.

forgot to update this, so after couple of plays i disliked/hated it mainly because of its victory conditions as i said, so got rid of it and i m extremely happy that i did! rating 2.0 (2016)
=================================
Havent played the lore cards yet because my plays are with my 12 year old son but having over 250 plays with CCA makes my mind difficult to synchronize with these victory conditions (capturing the flags instead of eliminating the enemy units) and i m loosing badly.. so from this point of view i m beginning to dislike it..
rating 7.0 (June 2014)

==================================
A pleasant game, more lighter than CC:A, but it is negative for the production value that it has 1 die less and some victory point tokens (2-5v.p. at least) in case of a tie for example 18-18 points...

BattleLore Second Edition is a two-player board game focused on squad-based battles between the hardy defenses of the Daqan Lords garrison in Nordgard Castle and the unleashed ferocity of the demon-worshipping Uthuk Y’llan. You must strategically command your troops and use the power of lore to tip your battles in your favor.

In every game, you will create new maps and scenarios, before mustering a new army for each game, so you can tailor your army to suit your favored play style. Command armies of fearsome warriors and deadly creatures, and lead them against the enemy in this intense game of warfare and military strategy. By seizing victory points from objectives on the battlefield and by eliminating enemy units, a skilled commander can raise his banners as the victor over the borderlands of Terrinoth!

Fun game in the C&C family with quite a bit of potential for building a larger fantasy world.  The addition of lore and how it is handled in this fantasy setting feels well done from my limited first play perspective.  Some of the lore cards are extremely powerful and knowledge of the cards and opponent's abilities is important.  The odds of success in die rolls is marginal but that is likely good for this type of game.  For ranged units you have a 1 in 6 chance of a hit but you can hit from four spaces away.  Melee units have a 1 in 3 chance of hitting unless they are in a weakened state (one token left) which reduces their hit chance to 1 in 6.  

The forces are asymmetrical and act very differently.  The scenario creation system is also interesting and well done as each side chooses between 7 setups that grant a special condition for your forces and also usually a special point scoring mechanism.

While I have some experience with the game's first edition, I am no familiar with the game system other than that it is a deriative from the Command and Color game by Richard Borg. However, the second edition is completely redesigned by Robert Kouba and hence I should look at it from a new perspective. After the game, I counted what I like about the game:

1) It is what I like Command and Color as a simple basic wargame system with all the chromes I wish they could have been added in modeling the ancient warfare.
2) More rules flexibility in adapting the rules to a fantasy world, bending the rules as the designer likes.
3) The units of the two sides, Daqan the more mobile and Uthuk the more bloodthirsty, are characterized by different movement, combat rates and health points and scenario specific rules vividly. Some special abilities like pursue, poison, massive, etc. pertain to only specific side.
4) The creation of a scenario and both sides objectives are entirely built by combining players' own choosing of one out of three scenario cards, yielding some interesting conflicting objectives at times.
5) Winning combat earns lore points, which are in turn used to trigger the unit's abilities or pay the cost of using "magic" on the lore cards.
6) Range combat and line of sight, blocked by hills, forest or buildings, are handled neatly like the archer units in the ancient.
7) Weak unit, those remains with only one figure on the board, has a fewer chance to score a hit in combat, ignoring the cleave dieroll result.
8) Hidden deployment cards, including decoys, are placed on the mapboard initially conveying a sense of fog of war in the beginning of the game.
9) Players can compose their respective army of a total of 50 muster points or follow the army cards suggestion. A player can choose to muster five extra army points if he decides to deploy a command tent. The tent, however, would add victory points to the enemy if it is captured by him. This flexibility in composing an army adds further uncertainty on what you might expect.
10) Victory is not limited to beating units up now with move varied types of victory points to earn, spicing up the strategies taken to win the game.

Overall, I like the game as much as the first edition. It's very quick to set up a game. I am sure I will find another to play it again. My interest in the game Battles of Westeros which utilize the same engine to the world of Game of Thrones heightens.

RATING: 9
In the Command and Colors system, I like Memoir 44 for it's simplicity (3 types of units, with a summary card for each type). I sold back Commands and Colors: Ancients because the rules where too complicated to remember in-between rare sessions (subtleties like support by leaders, elephants, units that can advance or not, etc.). Battlelore Second Edition is between both in terms of complexity, and is closer to Memoir 44: the rules are streamlined enough. That's a plus, in my book. 

The number of cards in hand is also limited to four for both the command cards (always four) and the lore cards: this uniformity helps going back to the game after a hiatus. 

Similarly, all the costs of removing some token that I have seen so far are of 2 lore. The uniformity makes playing the game easier (while playing, and when putting it back to the table).

Compared to Memoir, I like the simple but game changing additions: the variety, graphic design and surprise of the lore cards, of course, but also the initial liberty of the scenario choice (where players can indulge in what they feel like), and strategizing with the army mustering.

So, in my mind, Battlelore = Memoir 44, plus a very manageable bit of streamlined complexity, that brings the pleasure of choosing one's own scenario card, of strategizing during army mustering, and of wielding some surprising lore effects. 

I have not yet experienced the potential pleasure of choosing between more different units (which is offset partially by the added complexity), but this is another potential benefit compared to Memoir, during the mustering part.

This game is in the same category as Warhammer: Disk Wars, in my mind: customizable armies and unit placement, scenarios, objectives, fantasy world, multiple races, two-player wargame, not too long, relatively simple rules (a bit more involved, for Disk Wars). Now, Disk Wars replaces the random lore cards by strategically chosen and remarkably varied command cards (in a mini deck building way), adds a strategic choice of terrain, and richer and more varied units (even though this may be disputed), and adds a layer of guessing and mind reading with the secret objectives and its important initiative system. All in all, Battlelore is the simpler one, so it is easier to get to the table I guess, but Diskwars adds layers of goodness through simple mechanics.

* After playing once with the physical copy:

The rules are quite streamlined and clear: we had just a few questions, and the answer was right in the rule book, except for one (the wording for hill is a bit ambiguous: can units that attack units on a hill similarly ignore other units along the line of sight? symmetry would imply yes). I like games that allow me to jump right back in. For instance, the rules for support are so much simpler than in Commands & Colors: Ancients, while still allowing for some strategy.

The units have flavor (I like how the Viper Legion differs from the Yeoman Archers), which adds to the pleasure: one gets acquainted with each of them.

The scenario was not as flavorful as those in Memoir 44 (no reaching a village behind enemy lines [or am I making this one up? :)], no crawling on the beach under fire,…). We spent a lot of time defending nondescript points of interest.

The lore cards are a nice, flavorful addition that brings variety, compared to Memoir 44. They also add a bit of thinking at the end of each turn.

The game material is very good (very good drawings, nice linen finish on the cards, plastic figures that are quite hard—not as good as the amazing ones from Space Hulk 3rd edition, but still good—,…).

Now, this is still a game that is not so dense in terms of "gaming time": simple actions like moving troops and rolling dice take a good part of the time without being fun (discovering the result of these dice can be a lot of fun, but the dice rolling is still both very simple and repetitive).

The only thing I am currently missing from Memoir 44 is the more memorable scenarios. I need to try the official scenarios from the Scenario Builder and from the iPad app.

The base game feels way more strategic vs. the base game of Memoir 44. The deployment and mustering, 5 types of units vs. 3, the counterattacks, the Lore cards. It is still not overly complex. It's still quite simple and lots of silly fun. 

It is necessary to make chicken sounds when moving the bird around!

Gameplay:

+ plays in about 60-90 minutes
+ very tactical
+ unique armies with unique special abilities and various units
+ unit combos
+ various terrain
+ random maps
+ objective based Victory Points, which can vary each scenario

+ new expansions add even more variety and tactical possibilites to the game

- some rules need some getting used to and may easily be overlooked the first couple of sessions.

Components:
+ top-notch, high quality components
+ A LOT of very cool and detailed miniatures
+ nice artwork
+ you will definitely not be disappointed when unpacking this game

- too few dice, you will have to buy an additional set of dice. there is no way around it, unless you want to memorize dice results and then reroll.

Probably my favorite game in the Command & Colors system. Where Memoir 44 felt way too random, this game allows you to mitigate the luck of the rolls by giving you powers and ways to turn the tide slightly in your favor... so no turn feels like a complete waste.

Early first impression. I feel like it will fall in the 7-8 range. It is a more balanced system than say Imperial Assault skirmish that gets min/maxed into 4x4 tournament play. The downside is card draw can screw you over in terms of the command and lore decks. While you have ways to counter the poor draw in your lore deck, you still need to "waste" an action to do so.

Dynamic setup is really nice, but there's a solid reason additional expansions are being added in for more units. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
FUN:  I really like Battlelore 1st Edition, but in this version both factions feel different right off the bat because of their dedicated lore deck and more unique units. Most of all I like that there is no longer a casualty based victory condition that suddenly ends the game, but a system where boardposition matters until the end. I was afraid that this would lead to turtling, but thanks to the introduction of 'weak' units there's still enough incentive to attack.

UNIQUE: very similar to the 1st Edition, but better in almost every way.

NEGATIVES: setup takes even longer than in the 1st Edition and is only marginally more interesting.

BattleLore (Second Edition), from here on simply referred to as BattleLore, is a tactical fantasy war game for two players.  And it's a beauty to behold!  The competing armies are intricately detailed miniature renditions of soldiers, archers, cavalry, and creatures of varying description.  After set up the over-large board comes to life with an array of terrain types including: woods, hills, rivers, and buildings.

The game-play is simple.  Order your units, attack with them, and draw up new cards and/or Lore.  Lore is a sort of mana that allows players to play special Lore cards at certain points in the game.  These cards are powerful, and give players benefits in battle.  To win, players must either gain 16 points by controlling specific regions on the board, or by utterly eradicating the opposing army.

BattleLore is great fun!  If you like tactics, head-to-head combat, or fantasy, all in a reasonably short amount of time, then I can't recommend this game enough!  Buy it now.

Keep an eye on this. Never really liked battlelore... The system was interesting but the battles felt meaningless and gamey. So many wargames lack powerful scenarios that add any real purpose to the conflict. 

The custom objective terrain setup system may be just what this gaming system needed but I'm curious if it will have enough umph to make it stand out.

The miniatures are beautiful... But have the changes to the system added more meaning to the player choices and interactions? The setup time also needs to be much faster than the original. The more I think about the more I think this isn't for me... Not much call for a 2 player only combat game In my gaming group.

2 core sets
Dec 2013 - We like this iteration of the C&C system.  2 core sets give us excellent choices for army construction.  We like the map construction, army construction, in-game lore and lore cards, and movement and combat mechanics. The rules have a bit to be desired in its attempt at programmed instruction, but the reference booklet clears any ambiguities.  Lee loves the theme, and I'm expecting we'll get quite a few runs in with the base game just in time for expansion content.  The 5 base unit types on each side are balanced yet varied enough, and with the Lore and possible campaign options, this game is looking pretty hot for us right now.

Might be my favorite game right now. Really enjoying it! Love the theme, units, and the use of the command and colors system. Can't wait to play it more.

The digital app Battlelore Command is also excellent and you can play through a little campaign against the AI. That's what got me hooked on this game.

Edit: While I still think this is a great game, I have started to be bothered by how dependent the players are on the dice. Can be frustrating at points.

While the setting is a fun change from 1st edition, they sure did mess up the rules. The new retreat rules is causing some very strange and gamey play, and most of the other "streamlining" has removed a lot of the tactical depth of the original.

*Dec 31, 2014* Played my first game of this. I have played C&C:Napoleonics in the past and found that game was both awesome and tedious. This one was awesomer than I allowed myself to hope. Look forward to exploring it more. Right now, it's a solid 8 if I overcome how new and shiny it is, a 9.5 if I don't!

*March 2015* Excellent game. I like Napoleonics more, I think, but happy to play this one and can't wait for the expansions to really turn the army building into something exciting!

*August 2015* Raised from an 8.5 to a 9. With the two army packs, this game is exceptional. Every game is like the first one. I still like Napoleonics more but that one is a bit harder to get to the table with its more dry presentation. This game is just so much fun!

Current favorite with the girlfriend.  She keeps winning.  Turns are quick, factions feel balanced after 6 plays, scenario cards and VP system based on holding locations combine for a cohesive and exciting narrative through-line.

So long as the inevitable expansions stay balanced with what's here, this is likely to remain a favorite.

From the interactive setup, to the pieces (Warhammer Fantasy Battle - quality - worth), to the refined ruleset where the Borg's system finally can shine (more than in the WW1/2 settings imho), this game is just gorgeous.

If I had had it when I was a kid, I would have played like crazy every day. Now I play it [i]with[/i] kids, and they have a blast - but the game itself is dicey, random, and very light; 2 nice twists are that you can always spend a card to command a unit everywhere, and the Lore powers.

Let's hope to see other expansions translated in italian.

In Battlelore 2nd Edition treffen zwei riesige Fantasy Armeen aufeinander. Die menschlichen Daqan Lords und die dämonischen Uthuk Y´llan schenken sich nichts im Kampf umd en Sieg. Da es nur zwei Armeen gibt, ist Battlelore auch nur auf zwei Spieler ausgelegt. Zu Beginn sucht sich jeder Spieler seine Armee aus und kann diese leicht modifizieren. Nie werden alle Einheiten in die Schlacht geführt, die Spieler müssen sich entscheiden und legen damit ihre taktische Grundnote fest. Danach wird noch ein Szenario ausgewählt, welches die Siegbedigungen bestimmt. Und dann geht es auch schon los. Die Spieler befehligen ihre Truppen mittels Karten. Auf diesen Karten ist immer ein Bereich des Schlachtfeldes dargestellt (Links, Rechts, Mitte) und nur diese Einheiten dürfen agieren, die sich im entsprechenden Bereich befinden. Dadurch kommt taktische Würze ins Spiel. Unterschiedliche Geländearten und mächtige Zaubersprüche sorgen für zusätzlichen Tiefgang. Das Spielmaterial, allen voran die Miniaturen sind toll. Das Spiel selber ist ebenfalls gut, allerdings kam bei uns nach einigen Partien die ersten Ermüdungserscheinungen zum tragen. Eine Erweiterung mit einer dritten (und vierten) Armee, würde hier Wunder wirken.

RATING: N/A
You command an army of fearsome warriors and deadly creatures against your enemy, strategically commanding your troops and using magical powers to tip the battle in your favour.

A scenario-based fantasy wargame with a modular board, customizable armies, and variable player powers.

RATING: 8
Looks great, fun to set up, fun to play, enjoyable feel. Seemed a bit random and luck oriented, but the battles don't last that long, so I don't mind too much.

On the downside it's very expensive, since you basically need at least two expansions to make the armies more varied. I always cringe, when 2-player games cost this much.

Memoir '44 with fantasy. The units do more and have special abilities, but if you don't have the cards you can't use them. Sculpts are great but I just don't like the Commands and Colors system.

RATING: 9.25
The ONLY thing that holds this game back is the randomness of getting the command card that you need to help you.  I can handle the dice rolling, but it really hampers you when you just can't do anything productive!  Also think some of the scenario cards are a bit off balance!

Good game that streamlines the 1st edition.  I like the scenario creation and army mustering rules. Commands & Colors: Ancients is still the best game in the series but this is more accessible so I'll be able to play it with my daughter.

I've cooled on this game significantly over the past few months. I still think it's a solid system, but it just doesn't hit the table like it used to. Sometimes I just prefer the simplicity of Battle Cry. Still a fun game, just not one I'm always itching to play. Also feels a little imbalanced in favor of the monsters with just the base game.

BattleLore is Richard Borg's card driven combat system taken to a fantasy setting. Having previously played, and thoroughly enjoyed, Memoir '44, I can only judge BL by comparison.

As I unboxed BL the first glaring difference appeared: While M44 had a custom molded, plastic box insert, designed to hold the game's various components, BL had a simple cardboard trough, typical of Fantasy Flight Games. This was an immediate disappointment as I'd forgotten the games were published by different companies and was left fantasizing about the quality insert I would have received had BL come from Days Of Wonder.

Gameplay is similar to Memoir '44, but not the same. Unfortunately, how terrain functions and other minor differences are enough for me to get confused between the 2 games, requiring a rulebook to be onhand, which annoys me, so I feel I'm forced to choose one game or the other. BattleLore has to go. I prefer Memoir's simplicity over BattleLore's unit abilities and Lore system. I must say though, I wish Memoir had a scenario setup like BattleLore, as it is truly inspired!

Has some problems in play. After a few games we found the scoring method broken in comparison with the original. Needs some tweaking or rule changes to fix it.

Didn't really care as much for the new "world" either, but did like the newer ideas to take it really into the fantasy realm with different races. Sadly the scoring change killed it in my book.

Have only played the intro scenario, and it's a great twist on C&C. I'd like to get to the Lore scenarios eventually.

Despite mechanically being better than Battle Cry, it is missing a certain intangible something that keeps it from being a true contender for me.

And the gameplay is very challenging and surprisingly subtle.  

The Lore game is vastly improved over 1ed, as are many other things.

Haven't played this nearly enough to determine whether I enjoy this more than C&C: Ancients, but the magic system and the unique way to set up the board is excellent. I think the biggest issue I have with this version over C&C is that I much prefer a scenario over the randomized setup. Nothing wrong with this at all, I just prefer the historical context over this. I am excited to try out the additional armies though, I just wish they weren't $40 a pop (and yes, I understand that it's not THAT expensive given the content), I'd much prefer 2 in a box for $60.

Overall, the production quality is pretty good and there seems to be a lot in this box even with just the two armies. Neither being my preferred playstyle though. I vastly prefer the undead or evil side.  

Includes: 
* Great Dragon Reinforcement Pack
* Mountain Giant Reinforcement Pack

I’ve been a big fan of the Commands and Colors games since trying Memoir ’44 years ago. The only one still in my collection is BattleLore, and when 2nd edition was announced, I wasn’t sure whether I’d need to upgrade. After one play, I’m still not sure, but I really like some of the changes. Second Edition feel a lot more like a miniatures game than other C&C games, which feel like board games to me. This is mainly the result of giving all the units special powers, and I’m sure army construction/customization will further intensify this impression. Unlike previous C&C games that I’ve played, the units are asymmetric in this game. For example, the archers of the good guys have a different ability than the archers of the bad guys. This might mean that one side has a better chance of hitting while the other side has the potential to cause poison or another conditional effect. The large creatures now have health. When squads are down to a single unit, they are weakened and have a lessened chance of hitting. A player doesn’t necessarily score points for defeating his opponent, but instead must accomplish objectives laid out at the start of the game. The list of tweaks goes on, and I’m sure there are even others I didn’t notice or discover. Overall, the changes increase the complexity of the system. I think I need a few more plays before I decide whether or not to upgrade my 1st edition to 2nd.

I was feeling nostalgic for playing battle masters in the basement as a kid and decided to give this a whirl.  It is a fine game, but that is about it. I'm not crazy about the randomness introduced by the lore cards. I'd rather be able to have a better idea of success probabilities in battle. I could see how it would be right up the alley of some players, though.

RATING: 6.5
The setup to pay-off ratio the game brings was one of the reasons I sold it, it was so painful to get to the table that I didn't want to. Also, the need for expansions to make the game different from game to game did no favors to it.

I prefer Memoir '44, with its different maps integrated in the game to give it more variety and the realness of it. Also, the asymmetry of it was always the same, Memoir's maps change the assymetry with the maps and giving some different roles that can be taken away or put in easily

If you like Fantasy, over WW2, maybe this is better, but you have to spend more money on more armies/factions?

A very balanced and streamlined miniature war game for 2 players. BattleLore includes great looking miniatures and artwork in a deceptively deep yet light strategic game. Customize-able starting conditions makes no two games the same.

Pros:
- Allows customization of your army and starting conditions.
- Fantastic looking miniatures and artwork.
- New rule that allows the use of any card (ignoring the text) to order any one unit is a great addition to this game system.

Cons:
- Does not come with enough dice. (Game is playable with the 4 included dice but 8 would have been ideal)
- Additional dice are overpriced.

Thought I'd enjoy this more, but getting bad rolls is really annoying. Especially when you don't have good Command Cards to follow up. It obviously averages out in the long run but the game is relatively short, while the setup is long. 
If you play fast-ish, close to half of the time spend with the game is just setting up. And you still have to put it back in the box! So I only play multiple scenarios in a row. 
Still, it's a good game in this genre. Might introduce some house rules.

Battlelore is a heavier version of Memoir '44. I really like Memoir '44 for its educational and historical aspects. There is definitely some great strategy in Memoir '44 as well, but Battlelore is better mechanically. There is more to think about, which is not always great; but there is way better strategy at every stage of the game. From setup to actual resolution; way better. The length is a bit longer, but the game is definitely amazing. For a two player strategical miniature game, this is the best! Another thing that I really like about this game compared to Memoir '44 is that the two factions are of an equal strength. Each side has a legitimate chance to win each game. I like that better, even though I don't mind playing both sides in Memoir '44 twice to see who is the ultimate winner. The bottom line is that Memoir '44 is a great game, Battlelore takes the prize by a small lead. Both great games though. **Wife:6.5

My friend originally brought BattleLore over to my flat for a game, but we never got around to playing it on that occasion. It would be almost a year before we finally got around to playing.

I was quite eager to play BatteLore because it was based on the C&C system, and I hadn't previously experienced the system.

The board and miniatures are both of excellent quality, and I did enjoy the setting up process using tokens and the simultaneous army reveal so that each player didn't precisely know either the army composition of their opponent, or exactly where the units were set-up on the map. When the game actually started is when it began to fall flat.

Simply put, BattleLore is a simplified, light generic fantasy miniatures game that uses a bastardised version of the C&C system, and uses very light wargame mechanics.
It works ok as a "dudes-on-a-map" game, but fell flat for me because I was expecting a whole lot more from the C&C system. 

It speaks volumes that after the 1 initial play, we haven't played again, and my friend is putting it up for trade. He also informed me that has has Combat Commander: Europe, as well as C&C: Ancients. At least BatteLore didn't put him off the system.

I've played most of the C&C games, and appreciate them for their simplicity and speed of play. This is the most complex iteration of the game yet, with more moving parts and details to track than I look for when I play a C&C games. However, the innovations it has brought to the system in customization and balance gives this more depth than the rest of the system. And that customization is very well presented, so it's easier to handle than it could have been. I'm eager to play more.

Big fan of the original but look forward to this revision especially the scenario generation system, building your own force and specific stats for units.

So far after 4 plays I would say this is one of the best CC type games, feels more like a Miniature board game then a Boardgame with minis. 

Looking forward to all the possibilities in expansions, more scenario's with specific set ups, lots more units and abilities, Lore cards and more.

02-05-2014. Rated after 2 plays, about 1 month after playing it. 

I really like this game. Figures look awesome. Combat system is very much C&C, and I like how the cards constrain your options. 

FFG has stream-lined the dice-rolling and hit resolution significantly. I like the game a lot. For 2p games, I think I like a couple of games better than I like Battlelore. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with this game (well, WHERE ARE THOSE OTHER 2 FACTIONS FFG!!! ;))! But otherwise, I'd be happy to play it when suggested, although I may suggest Spacehulk or Magewars before this title.

My husband loves this....it is very similar to Memoir '44, just fantasy.  It is definitely a war game, which I'm not a huge fan of it, but it is very easy to play.  If I am going to play a game like this, I'd rather do the historical version (Memoir), but this is okay.  I don't really get excited about setting up my own army and starting  positions, which this games allows and Memoir doesn't (because Memoir is historically accurate), but if you like that type of thing, you will enjoy this game for that added freedom (which I personally don't need or want).

Light, straightforward tactical combat.  I dig it.  I did feel like my first few games required a lot of rules lookups for as light as this is, but overall they did a good job here.

Games generally feel tight with a bit of back and forth.  It is also quite pretty to look at.

Unfortunately 2 player games aren't really my jam and this wasn't changing that opinion.

RATING: 8
A great game with a huge replayability.

Scenarios are build by matching two different cards, so that before you see the same combo being drawn again you can have played more or less 50 games.

Mustering the armies grant a plus valore to replayability, and offers a good chance to exercise strategic thinking since the setup.

The terrain tiles, the different abilities and movement capacity of the units, the heterogeneity of the Lore decks, the special rules coming with each Scenario: all these elements make Battlelore 2nd edition a unique experience.

Even if rules appear to be streamlined and semplified from the Battles of Westeros experience, the result is great and, eventhough the game is not difficult, there are indeed a lot of options so that you have to think a lot in order to play well.

Recommended to anyone who wants a light wargame to start with

The game is a lot of fun and well balanced. I hope FFG will bring new expansions with more faction.

I just think the victory point system should be tweak a little bit. One thing I would suggest is to make VP at the start of your turn instead of at the end. So for example you would have to occupy a banner marker an entire turn to make points.

[1 play] Gave this to Orrin for Christmas 17. I had played the original, which has a few less refinements than this version, but has a more friendly cartoonish atmosphere than the darker more brutal artwork and theme of the Terrinoth theme.

I think they did a nice job with the army and scenario building component in this version. The creatures are cool and scary looking. Looking forward to many more battles of this with Orrin.

After playing this for the first time, I think I prefer it to Memoir '44.  The size of the tiles and the art on them, as well as the extra and modified mechanics make this seem easier to play.  Knowing how your opponent scores points and defending the areas that accumulate points is more important than just wiping out enemy units since killing a unit doesn't actually score you any points unlike Memoir.  I still like Memoir for sure, but I know whenever I do play it from now on, I'm going to think of how much better it would be if it just had the larger tile and unit sizes of Battlelore.

When I was little I had a game called Battle Masters (which I never learned to play-just used my imagination to create scenarios by myself) and looking at the box, this game reminded me of it and the minis looked great so I picked it up with the intention of learning to paint.

I promised myself I would learn this game-and I did!!
Not only that, but I managed to do so without needing to go to Youtube!!

I spent about 10 hours over 2 days just playing against myself, choosing the best options I could for each turn for each side and had an absolute BLAST!!! However I do recommend playing against a human.

THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE THIS GAME BETTER: Somehow create a companion app that makes movements/decisions for the opponent.

I have to repeat something said by Tom Vasel and others: Why would you spend hundreds of dollars on Warhammer figures, when you have everything you need for 2 players in a box?!! Not only that but there are so many different combinations you can create depending on what would work best for the scenario/battlefield chosen.

Uses the Command and Colours system (memoir 44) and Fantasy themed which is my personal preference. The lore cards do give this game a bit more depth than Memoir 44 imho and allow for greater strategy.
 VP,s are earned in various different ways depending on the set up scenario, sometimes it's for holding certain areas others for killing certain troops etc so loads of replayability and variety.
 Now that extra armies are available I have had to raise my rating as they bring so much more variety to the table both in terms of troops that can be fielded and also set up scenarios although there are different set ups on the Fantasy flight forums.
Playtime including set up is usually around 2hr 30mins but often less.

I REALLY like the new rules. Now my favorite of this series. Mildly chaotic lore in a very enjoyable way.
Edit: lowered rating to 8 from 9 due to the Darken the Skies command card issue: there are, with the new armies now released, 30 units, only 3 of which can use this card. A game like this does NOT need low usage cards clogging up a hand.

I had never played any of the Commands and Colors system games before.  They are war games and I'm not the biggest fan of war games.  So is this of course but the fantasy theme drew me in more than those others would.

And my favorite part was the command card system.  Drawing command cards and choosing which one to use which all dictate different units in different areas that can be activated on a turn is a deep strategic mechanic that I really enjoyed.  The lore cards/powers was another great mechanic that gave the gave lots of flavor and variability.

Plus the turn-based fantasy battles really intrigue me, I love that the units are all fantasy-themed with varying powers and custom dice that do different things.  If I were able to acquire a frequent two-player partner for games like this and keep up with the expansions which I would just NEED to have I would be scrambling for my own copy right now.

Having come from a long history with Warhammer Fantasy Battle, I got out of games like that because I hated the measurements and the arguments that could arise from that.  The hexes of Battlelore do away with that.  But aside from that, the combat system, the scenario system, everything is great.  The only thing I am not happy with is the lack of armies.  I just wish that there was more!

The fourth version of the Commands & Colours system that I've played if you count Battlelore 1st edition as a separate game.  The production design is beautiful, the battle generation system is excellent and a vast improvement on 1st edition.

I think that it is best to have one version of the Commands & Colours games and expand it, rather than have several.  I think that the primary choice should be based on theme.  I have ancients which is the right theme for me and which is a slightly harder game to wrap your head around.  But this game is certainly beautiful and the most lavish production.

Does everything the original does, but with 50% less fat. Less bookkeeping, less fiddliness, less setup and much more theme and chrome. The miniatures are top notch, and the unit abilities are really thematic. I like the point buy army system much more than the original Call to Arms. All in all, it is a no-brainer: Daddy BL to the shelf.

EDIT 2018/01/11: With all the troubles BL has gone through, I finally found out what I really wanted was a simplified miniatures fantasy game that was cheap and easy to play and tinker with. Song of Blades and Heroes has completely replaced BL for me.

A joy, pure and simple. This (in conjunction with Combat Commander) will almost certainly replace Memoir '44 for me.

I played the original Battlelore once. I don't remember hating or loving it. I do remember thinking it was a bit fiddly and I despised the fact that all the units were the same color. I tried to attack my own units at least twice. The flags were annoying. I was happy to play it that one time, but it didn't call to me.

Battlelore 2e is an entirely different story. It is streamlined in comparison to its parent (BL1), but it's actually somewhat heavier than M44, ruleswise. Each character has slightly different rules and each scenario card also gives slightly different rules and rewards. A bit swimmy for me in my first few games but I'm getting used to it.

Speaking of those scenario cards, I do love them. Much more than pre-printed scenarios from a book. Also, the simultaneous placement of units using cards is an inspired idea. We've been ignoring the decoy cards in casual play. We find them a bit jammy. I can see they would have a place in serious competition.

After a handful of games I'm already ready for expansion armies. Hell, expansion ANYTHING involved with this game. And I never say that about any game. I'm an abstract, old-school-Euronut but this game has truly captured my soul.

My first C&C game, and it's excellent. Good balance of luck and tactical skill. The Lore cards are pretty fairly balanced. The ability to build your own scenarios on FFG's website pretty much extends the replayability infinitely. A must-buy if you have any interest in tactics games.

Solid improvement over the first edition, especially because it has customizable armies and the Lore system is much better implemented. The scenario-building aspect is great and combined with the fact you get to build your army every game, it ensures varied and different games every time. High fantasy wargames are hard to do, but this certainly scratches that itch on a battlefield level.

I like the gameplay a lot and prefer the theme over the other games that use this system. The scenario system is a nice addition and I like the hidden setup.

However, it seems like the blue team has a much easier time winning. The blue team has won by at leas 6-8 points in each of my games so far and I've seen people on the forums with similar experience.
It's also very disappointing that the game didn't come with enough dice to play. Some of the units require you to roll five or more dice, but the game only comes with four dice. To make matters worse, FFG is releasing a dice pack that you can buy separately just to make the game complete.

If this proves to be more balanced, I can see this replacing Memoir '44 for me.

What I like about this 1vs1 game is that is comes with a simple rules that you can start with and then go on with the full intended rules. It is also rather quick.

It has a fair amount of randomness to it but that said the game is not entirely luck driven. Not sure the expansions will add much but core box sure contain enough for a good amount of plays.

What I like about this edition of Battlelore, is that it offers streamlined summary cards (no need to reference weapons with units anymore), a clean and fast system to set up a scenario and assemble an army, and multiple ways to score victory points. All of them improvements over the first edition. Personally, however, I still like the scale and epic feel of the original miniatures better, and the support/pursuit/battle back rules of that edition felt more natural too. All in all, both editions scratch the same itch, and it is an itch that I do not feel too often, because of the randomness of the dice results and card play. Pleasant to bring to the table every now and then, but not too often.

I really don't know how this happened. Total waste of time. Core set introduction game (learning set) give you an impression that this is a very simple and, unfortunately, just dull game without any depth. Extended rules gives you only more units but they are not any different from basic units - just different names and different values for attributes. Total random in all ways - beginning with placement of units up to the dice rolls. Mechanics sucks as basic unit can in one move destroy your massive unit (really? how this could be possible in more "real" model). I really loved Warzone Mutant Chronicles. This was/is an amazing game - 300-350 PLN for such weak game like Battlelore is a misunderstanding. I own runebound which is not perfect but doesn't look like it was made on a knee under pressure of time and money... one point for great quality custom dice set - with Runebound FFG did something terrible in this matter...

The only thing that is missing from this soon to be classic is more races and units.

As soon as I see Elves and/or more races, I will buy this game.  As of now, it has too few options to make it a buy.

Enjoyable, but has some serious problems with turtling and catching an early leader... in other C&C games a leader has to keep DOING things to keep their lead, while in most of these scenarios they will still get a reliable stream of a couple VPs per turn from camping on certain terrain or objective hexes even as you fight to both dislodge them and make up the deficit at the same time. Step one - deploy chaos lord next to VP banner hex. Step two - move him onto VP banner hex and leave him there the entire game.

On the plus side, the minis are excellent (the best of any C&C game) and the heavily asymmetrical units and lore decks keep combat very interesting, even if broader gameplay isn't always. 

That is to say, this game has exciting moments, but overall is often anticlimactic.

Takes what I liked about the original and puts in the Terrinoth world.  I think the lore cards are terrific.  They really add to the Commands and Colors system.  The scenario generation is also really neat.  The art and miniatures are top notch.  The ultimate in the Commands and Colors system.

Love this game. Have played seven times in three weeks, every game challenging and fun.  The game dynamics make it stimulating. Best of Command & Colors due to fog of war set up and victory conditions which compel players to fight for objectives.

It takes the tried and true system of C&C and gives it a nice magic abilities addition. Part of the dryness that comes with C&C is removed by the inclusion of Lore cards that spice the gameplay up and adds an exciting degree of uncertainty.

Fast becoming one of my favorite games. Cuts on downtime when setting up scenarios, every match is unique and very personalized, the mechanics open up a lot of new possibilities when compared to Memoir 44, Which I still really like but felt was too randomized, one-sided and not personal or individual enough, and took too long for one person to set up. This game fixes that.

Still a decent game.  But I really hoped for more from this FFG redesign.  The armies out of the box are kind of boring and seem to be unbalanced.  There hasn't been any interesting content released either.  Disappointing because I really think Borg's C&C system could support a fantasy mini's hobby to rival Warhammer.

I love the new scenario set-up and army building, but am less happy with the new style of order deployment. Command and Colors has always been about fog of Command and that is completely lost in the new system. I also mourn the loss of historical battles, because I have zero interest in the Runebound setting. I always had a minor complaint that battlelore took longer to set up than it did to play. I feel like that has gotten worse! The unit special abilities and new retreat rules seem to generate an awful lot of one shot kills.

At least the system found some life somewhere, I guess.

Great game, great components. Stands the test of time. To bad FF does not support it anymore with more expansions and armies. Would love to see a campaign book for this à la Memoir'44.

I rated the original a "10" and think this version improves upon it.  Better minis, mission oriented scenarios, tighter rules.  Worth having both.

RATING: 9
Basically 1st edition cleaned up. The dice are essentially the same but cleaner (no color matching, much easier to read). Deployment is like the expansions for 1st edition, it's now just part of the base game (again, making the game cleaner). Points for building the armies makes sense and is intuitive. Hex grids are larger and the models are larger allowing for easier handling (also no assembly!). However, they removed heroes, removed the war council, and it's not backwards compatible, so not only is 1st edition obsolete, even if you wanted to use them they look funny sitting next to their larger kin.

RATING: 8
I liked the original BattleLore, probably more so because of it's fantasy theme, but compared to Memoir, there were a few problems: the flags depicting sides, the ever increasing and unwieldy number of additional units, the complexity of the war council, and the resulting combined lore deck.

Well, the second edition fixes all of those problems and adds a much more interesting win condition based on scenario cards chosen by both sides. The units are now two different colors, easily showing who's who. Each unit type comes with it's own card and YOU determine what units you play with (in addition to some prebuilt armies) so you can change complexity based on your desires. The war council is gone and now you have a faction-specific lore deck that gives each side some flavor in addition to the units.

Overall, this is a fantastic update to a wonderful property and it continues Fantasy Flight's trend of fantastic second editions.

I like how easy this game can be picked up and played. Rules are not complex, but scoring felt a bit odd at first. Unit variety in the base box does feel a bit restrictive (I would have given it an 8 instead of 7 if more unit options were available).

I really enjoy the system of Memoir '44 but also like fantasy settings. The new tweaks that this game makes to its predecessor takes the gameplay up a notch in my opinion. I really enjoy how you set up each scenario and your ability to customize what troops you're going to bring in to battle.

The two plays that I have of the game to date were a lot of fun. Looking forward to playing it again soon.

This is the Battle Lore that I've always wanted. THe main things I like about it are:

1)No flag set-up like in Battle Lore 1.0
2)More stream lined combat
3)The retreat system is way more intuitive
4)The mustering system is just awesome
5)The scenario setup is phenomenal
6)Having objectives to try and control over just killing other units makes it way more tactical
7)Both players get the same number of turn, no sudden victory

So interesting to start playing this after Memoir 44. As much as the C&C system is clearly at the heart of it, this feels like a very different game to me. I love how game-changing and brutal the lore cards can be. Can't wait to spend more time getting to know the units better. Not entirely sold on the 16 VP endgame condition - I do miss gaining VP for destroying units - but I've seen that there are a few scenarios that bring this into effect as a special condition, so we'll see!

Excellent Miniature skirmish game. The Scenario building and mustering are very unique and a bit more to the game. This is the right simplification of the Commands and Colors system. The same amount of strategy is still there, but you have to think less about some things that I considered fiddly in other C&C games.

Also love the universe and it makes a great Realms of Terrinoth game.

As a diehard Battlelore Fan, I was worried that FFG would dumb this down like they did with Descent second edition.  I did not have any problems with the changes made and actually enjoy having the fantasy theme strengthened.  I was also glad they did not use the same boring world as Runebound and Runewars.  I sort of miss the war council and the scenario books, but like the faction specific lore decks too and flexibility of mustering too.

Only reason it's not a 10 is that it takes long to set up - I wish there were more pre-made scenarios. I understand the fun and strategy of choosing your armies, it just makes the barrier of entry and playing time a little longer than I think it needs to be.

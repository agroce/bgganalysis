This game might be a 8 but I give it a 1 for the poor customer care on Essen.

I went in Essen 2013 to there demo table. Be sighs me and the demo person no one was at the table. I ask if I could get an explanation, I told I had already bought the English version of the game. Know comes the clue. Because I already had bought the game they refused to explain the full rules. They only want to explain the global rules. 

At the stand they don't want to put more effort in explaining the game two some one who has it. I have no words for this behavior to a customer.

RATING: 6
There is lots in the box and it is all very good looking, but at heart Venetia is a plain old area control game with Doge elections providing a second source of victory points that should not be ignored.  There are also quite a few random elements from War of the Ring-stye action dice, to turning chits for military success (a way of placing cubes in an area), to action cards with some quite strong effects, and foreign powers who pop up and kill your  cubes.  It plays quite smoothly, but doesn't really develop, beyond the board growing more crowded.  I felt that there wasn't quite enough going on to merit the time investment.

The rating is tentative.  I can say that when the Dicebox reviews a game I have played, or am thinking of getting, I end up liking the game.  It is just another example of how subjective such tastes are, but I find Tom's negative criteria--his complaint about Venetia being "fiddly," for example--sometimes has me wanting to fall out of my chair with laughter.  More to come.

I liked it till the point where you draw threat cards. Totally random. And in our play 1 player was never affected. Drawing victory points from 1-3 is also luck based. And it takes much too long.

Acquired 2014 BGGCON VFM

Played 3p game at Texicon 2015

I really enjoyed this game. The dice are very nice. I like the difference between the commercial, military and political actions. The Doge election is interesting. The epoch "clock" is also a different mechanic. The cards add some fun twists. The game plays fast once you get past the small learning curve. I agree with comment above that a scoring track and canvas bags would have been nice. I can see this one getting played a lot in the future. I disagree that you have to have keen interest in Venetian history to appreciate this game. This game is different from other games with some interesting mechanics. It has a somewhat cooperative feel to it, but can be quite cut throat. The game can be acquired at a pretty reasonable price. I recommend it.

Interesante juego de control de zonas de los creadores de War of the ring. Bebe de este la mecánica de selección de acciones a partir de un juego de dados disponible para todos los jugadores

Cada jugador representa una casa de la ciudad-reino de Venecia durante la época de su esplendor. A través de la elección de un dado de los disponibles el jugador activo tiene una serie de puntos para influenciar de determinada manera (nuevamente marcada por el dado) en las colonias que pueda alcanzar. A medida que las colonias van recibiendo influencia se convierten en puestos comerciales que los jugadores quieren controlar para puntuar.

A la hora de elegir el dado, el jugador activo debe decidir si elegir pocos puntos de acción que le reportan cartas de acción o bien muchos puntos de acción que le dan cartas a los demás jugadores.

Estas cartas de acción aparte de ser putaditas sirven para poder influir en la elección del doge que es el jugador inicial y posee una pequeña ventaja que potencia su turno o puntos gratis

Visualmente muy bonito

It would be another area control game but the action cards make it different. It has some good ideas (dices for actions, variable length of the game) but some options are poor (VP chits, identical areas, hazarous threat cards). In summary the result is too randomness. The historical background and the design are very good, but the box is incommesurate.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Has an interesting twist on area scoring with each scoring area having multiple provinces: minor ones where presence will be fairly secure but only allow limited scoring potential, and the major one that can score the area fully but that are much more vulnerable. The interesting bit is with the interaction with the threat cards with cause external attacks to be launched on player holdings at various times.

However, there were a couple of sources of randomness too much for my liking (dice, 2 different decks of cards, vp tokens, attack tokens, blind bidding).

RATING: 9
The positive surprise package of Essen 13. A sort of an area majority game with only a minor hint of a stacking contest problem. Players are thematically smartly cooperating a bit to expand the Venetian might, but the competition is still the main point. The dice system is nice and dice are of great quality. The action card system is even nicer with cards seemingly in a really good balance and having a nice multiuse function with a clever voting mechanism. The threat cards add a thematically well implemented surprise factor and the epoch clock is also a fine little mechanical piece. A really compact and quickly playing offering. Pros also for adding cool historical background info and making attacking other players directly possible, but not encouraged; and cons for not adding a vp score track around the board and two canvas bags for vp tokens and battle tiles.

A very original dice-based action point scheme. The action points are mostly used for gaining area influence but the game cleverly avoids the tug-of-wars so typical for influence games. 

After reading the rules, I was worried about card effects and the voting. Both are actually quite interesting: Card effects are moderate and also balanced by the possibility and need of using the cards for voting instead of their effects. The voting is rather clever since depending on both the available dice and board situation, you don't always even want to win the vote. The event cards do not really create chaos either but instead work as a timing device that has to be kept in mind when planning for board movement.

Forcing the players to keep score with pen and paper is a really weird design choice.

Well, this must be the strangest 'demo'-experience ever. We were sitting at a table of Venetia at the Passport Game Studios booth. We asked if someone could explain the game to us. So I guy came with us, said we had to take a set of playing pieces and cards of one colour. Then he said we should chose a card. 'Why?', I asked him. 'To see who will have first choice of the die' he answered. So we played a card. Then he found in the rulebook what the different coloured dice did, so we all picked one and put down some pieces on the board and drew some cards, not having a clue why we were doing things. Then I asked him a - imho - simple question: 'when does an era end?'. Then he just left and called someone who seemed to be his boss. He explained that in fact nobody could explain the game to us. 'So why put this game on a table and take up space (they only had 4 tables or so) if you can't explain it?' I asked him. 'Because then people can see the components and it works because it is selling well', was his answer before he left us :s.

So the only thing I can say about this game is that it has some really ugly artwork and that the components aren't that great!

RATING: 6.5
Super nice components in this game, but the box is definitely bigger than it needs to be. The dice action selection system is pretty good here, and it does a good job of balancing the value of cards vs the value of action points. You definitely want to play with the optional rules and with the full complement of players.

I'm generally not a big fan of games with a lot of direct conflict or a lot of randomness. So I was a little hesitant about this game.

Venetia is sort of an area control game, but not really? There's a pool of communal dice of three types. Brown dice let you put cubes in a single city, a number of cubes equal to the number of pips. Yellow dice let you put a cube in a number of different cities, the number equal to the pips. Gray dice can be used either way, and also let you attack pirates... but they're risky. You draw a token from a bag and see if anything happens. You might put 2 guys in a spot, or one or none. Or you might draw a card instead. All the dice range from 2 to 4 pips, with the low numbers giving you a card draw and the high numbers giving everyone else a card draw.

When putting cubes out on the board, in order to put cubes in a city you must be connected to that city area, which means that you must trace a naval path from the start space to the city by placing a cube on each sea zone it takes to get there. It doesn't matter if you've done that in the past, you have to recreate it each turn... unless the sea zone has cubes equal to it's sea number, at which point it gets a token on it and no one has to pay anymore cubes for that sea zone.

Each city has a city number. If there are at least that many cubes in that city, then whoever has the majority of cubes there is promoted to the controller of that city and places a throne (or something, I can't remember what it was called) there. During scoring, those pieces will generate points. If there is a tie, no one gets the throne, and thrones are dynamically checked if anything changes in that city. If there's ever six or more cubes in a city, there's a riot and every player with a cube in that city loses a cube from there and majority is checked again.

There are threat cards that get played periodically. These will randomly determine which cities are attacked by other empires. When a region is first attacked, the players with cubes in the capital of that region lose a cube there. When a region is attacked and already is controlled by another empire, everyone in that region loses a cube in each city. You can spend your dice points to attack the empire and remove control from another empire, which gives you a shield symbol from that empire... each unique shield gives you a point (but there's a lot of attacks from the Ottoman empire and doubling up on shields doesn't do anything). Threat cards also send pirates out which conquer sea zones, breaking your connection to distant areas. No one can place cubes in any city in the regions that a pirate is blocking or beyond. You must spend gray dice actions to kill the pirates (worth a point) before you can do that, and then you'll have to rebuild a route to the appropriate region.

The game is played over three rounds, the timing of which are triggered in an unusual way. You track how many thrones there are with a white pawn on the "time track". When it hits 10, that triggers the end of the first round. When you draw threat cards they can move the black token from the other side of the time track down. In the second round, when the black token reaches the white token (or vice-versa) the round ends. The last round ends when the black token reaches zero.

At the end of each round, there is scoring. You either get 1 point for having a throne in any non-capital city of a region (multiple thrones in the same region don't do anything) or capital points for having a throne in the capital, which range from 1 for close regions to 3 for distant regions.

The cards that you draw during the game give you special abilities. They are color coded and can be played with a die of the matching color. When you acquire them you can alternatively bank them to augment your next bid for doge. During the doge auction you play one of your family cards from your hand, which are numbered 1-6. Whoever has the highest number, which is the sum of the family card and banked cards, becomes the doge. They put three doge tokens on their family member and for the next three rounds they either score a point or get an extra pip on the die they choose. After the last token is used, a new doge is elected.

The game does have a fair bit of randomness. During our first play, one player took an early lead and had a lot of thrones on the board, but lost a lot of them when other empires attacked his particular regions. Also, you can use gray dice and just lose out, attacking and drawing the zero tokens and doing nothing. Despite that, I did enjoy the game.

Absolutely underrated; this game deserves surely an average evaluation higher than the current Geek rating.
A very beautiful board, very good materials, an evocative setting, interesting mechanics. A must-have for lovers of Venice's history.
My suggestion is to use the optional rules from the very first game.
Just a thing for the editors: a rule-summary sheet per player and three velvet bags (for combat tiles, VP tiles and sestrieri tiles) would have been glad in the box.

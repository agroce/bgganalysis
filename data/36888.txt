RATING: 6
The Treefrog line is becoming the most dependable set of games there is (more so than Alea) and a subscription is now mandatory. I have some concerns that the military strategy is too dominant but I trust Martin's playtesters too know more than I do after just a handful of games. The length and the need for exactly three means it won't get played too often but that is also one of the reasons why i really like it.

It's a great game, lots of decision to make, but not complicate if you grasp the designer's idea. The first
game (in fact, we only played one round out of five), took 2 hours, though it is fully justify to have all five rounds.

I am not ready to rate this yet.  I've only played it once, and it took me several turns to begin to see how all the elements meshed.  When I asked one of my companions during the game what sort of game he would call it, he said "It is a Martin Wallace Game;" a unique blend of mechanisms.  I can say I was very impressed how it balanced the play between three players, even when one (me) was significantly weaker at the strategy.  I would not turn down the opportunity to play again, but in an ideal world I would first take time to play with it on my own to work out how to efficiently produce points.

Typical Wallace territory, melding Euro mechanics with light wargaming. The interplay between the resource management and the military is really quite original and the game's most interesting feature. 

Like other commenters, I think that After the Flood is deceptive.  Reading the quite lengthy rules, you have the impression of a fairly complex and deep game.  However, turns resolve into trading up resources to enhance cities and build bigger armies. Since combat favours the attacker, you delay founding your empire as long as possible in order to cut down your opponents' empires rather than be cut down.  Delaying tactics lead to dawdling little steps of play.  And this is a three hour game...

I agree with candoo's comment that After the Flood feels like "Five rounds that seemed disconnected and without a story arc."  This is underlined by the empires that entirely vanish between turns.  It would have been better, in terms of story arc, if vestiges of empires had remained on board in the style of History of the World.

Production quality is good and I found the artwork quite pleasing.

Definitely an interesting and challenging resource conversion, action sequencing, victory point calculating challenge of a game, with some final round area majority thrown into the mix as well.  

Perhaps not as elegant, or thematic, as it could be, it still has a certain fun factor to it.  With all the VP calculation strategizing going on, this game feels kind of a bit like Amun Re or other Knizia games wherein the correct play is certainly not intuitive or thematically obvious, but instead, thoughtfully "solved" by comparing victory point path options.  Nothing wrong with that really since that fairly well describes a lot of great games, but "figuring out" the correct victory point path in this game feels pretty opaque at times, at least on first play.

All in all, I still like the game.  I think it deserves another play to see if things come into slightly greater focus.

This is only my third Martin Wallace game, and I'm really gaining an appreciation of his design style.  I like the way the theme and mechanics are integrated in this one.  There's worker placement, resource management, ever-changing strategies, and lots of nice wooden bits.  A very good game.

Rating could certainly go up; I definitely like this game. It is an especially tight game, which is impressive. We managed a game in two and a half hours for my first play, not counting the few rounds I played solo to learn the game.  I think that I would appreciate this game less if there was a lot more conflict between empires. We certainly vied for control, but more often than not empires were used to prevent others from trading in regions, which is pretty devastating as it is.

After my initial play this could turn into my favourite Wallace game, which is quite a compliment.  Very enjoyable - despite getting several rules wrong.  The dynamics worked well as the game was fairly fluid.  The clever positioning of the new territories means that an attack on one opponent does not result in you being overly vulnerable to the other.  The two types of 'workers/soldiers' reminded me of Pillars.  Looking forward to further plays as and when player numbers (3) permit.

Second game, ebbed and flowed as I went from first to last and back.  Conflict is beautifully balance.  This is a first class design.

Third game and a major blow up between my two opponents with one (unreasonably) feeling victimised.  I will have to be careful who I play with in future!

you can feel a wallace in this from a mile off.

some very well working together mechanics, however:

the military part seems too important as getting a big army helps you a lot in being the last to pass which seems crucial.  I haven't seen 'optimize your actions' in the least in this one.

A deep game with smooth mechanisms and constant player interaction. I should love this, but I cannot understand why Martin Wallace keeps crippling his games with clumsy dice elements. The combat with 2 d6 is crass and I felt nothing but dispair as a large army only intending to move two areas was eliminated by a constant series of 3's & 4's rolled. The modifiers in our game made a difference once in the entire game.

I know the wargamer's argument that small forces have frequently beaten large ones throughout history. Agreed but that is warfare this is a game. I used to be a wargamer, now I have moved on and am a board gamer. I object absolutely to important tipping points of any game being decided so fundamentally on the roll of a die.

Some people think dice are OK. For me it breaks a game. Unless someone can think up a variant that removes the dice, I don't want to play again.

Initial impression:

Played only first round and decline - took 1.5 hours.

I'm really not liking the MW games where you have 5 nearly disparate rounds as much as the others.  Brass with 2 nearly disparate rounds works fine, there are enough things that carry over (namely income and level 2 buildings), but this game is likely not so much for me.

I really don't get why the "stronger army/dice rolling" mechanic is necessary, simply killing off any unit would have been simpler and made things flow better.

RATING: N/A
I'm glad I played this as I feel like I'm getting a better appreciation for Wallace and his ability to develop a complex system of give and take with fairly simple actions.  The early game resource management was very interesting, though I did struggle with it (don't miss out on grains and textiles).  Later in the game, there seems to be a heavy 3-player balancing effect with the empires in that a two will beat up on the leader... at least, that's what happened with us.  It made for a close game at the end but a somewhat deflated finish.

I love what Wallace is doing with this Treefrog line. Picking obscure themes and bring them to light through three hours of gaming. All of these games are fluid and capture the themes well. In After the Flood players use the Sumerian workers to fuel everything else in the game. This is done through trade, tool making, and production of grian and textiles. This fuel is then used by different invaders of the time to oppress your opponents Sumerian and slow them down. Quite clever. "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

Another strong Wallace game. 3 player only games are rare. Only played this a couple of times so far, but it's very clever. Area control, dice rolling combat, trading, this game has it all! 

All 3 of us want to play this again pretty soon as we all learned a few things as went along.

Like all 3 player games, it's important to balance things by having the 2 players in second and third gang up against the leader, otherwise it tends no to work too well.

I can't quite put my finger on why I didn't like this game. I'm a fan of lots of Wallace games, particularly the longer, more 'thinky' ones, it's designed specifically for three and we played with three. It just seemed like a set of mechanics put together in a box and called a game. It's not necessarily that they didn't fit together, although the logic behind some of them left me guessing. I just felt like I was playing the mechanics rather than playing a game. At the end of the day, it just wasn't fun and its a long game to play when you're not having fun playing it. A shame, but this one was a miss for me.

First off, the feeling.  It feels like you're in the cockpit of a plane and all around you are all of these controls and you have no idea what button to press or lever to move.  

Unlike every other Wallace game I've played, there wasn't that gnawing feeling of starvation.  There's no money, so he can't have those awful loans (or pollution or whatever the black things are in Automobile).  Resources are still tight, but you feel like you're playing against the other players less than against the game.  

Each round you get a set amount of grain and textiles (based on the relative ordering of players in those two boxes) plus what you have left over from previous rounds.  That's it.  You have no more chances to get more resources till the next round.  All you can do is trade resources for other resources (same quantity but more "valuable").  There's no way to get more.  That may have been the greatest breath of fresh air.  No Agricola "let me take the 4-wood spot".  

You place workers on a map so that you're able to trade resources for other resources and to found an empire.  Founding an empire gives you access to armies.  Armies are one of two principal scoring mechanics.  You expand armies (empires, whatever) in a Small World area-control mechanic.  However, at the end of the round, all armies disappear from the map and you have to create a new empire in the next round.  Fighting is easy and quick and the only question is who "equipped" their army better  when it was originally formed (by spending resources) because that person has an advantage on rolling.  

The second principal way to get points is by turning in a set of different resources at the end of the round to "expand a city" (basically just converting a set of 0 - 4 different goods into VPs.  My gut is you can get almost equivalent points by going military or going city expansion, but after one play I'm not sure.  

There's a lot more there than what I've said, but that was what stood out.  Resources are tight but not strangling.  Armies are fun.  Placing workers is tough, especially because they consume resources you'd like to use for other things.  A tight, brain-burny game that after a single play, I think smokes God's Playground.  

I can't really compare it to AoS or Brass because they are so different, but I think AtF may be in my top 3 brain-burny Wallace games,  After one play, I'd say it's more brain burny than AoS (with the basic map) and easier to teach than Brass (though not necessarily any more brain-burny).

(1 play) The components are really nice, the board is clear yet colourful and I like the wooden army and worker pieces.

The game itself ... well ... it's too long for what it is and the so called "delay strategy" doesn't help either. "Delay strategy" means that you can make small moves and trades, thereby trying to be the last player to pass (thus being able to make some unopposed moves). 

I wonder if this game has been playtested and I'm rather disappointed by its poor quality.

Only played once. Another typical Martin Wallace game, with a weight between Tinners' Trail and Brass. Players try to convert resources into city VPs while also spending them on actions. Workers are required for trades and to claim an Empire (like Britannia and Small World you will control multiple empires throughout the game).

By no means was this a bad game... in fact I thought it was pretty fun.

However, it did seem to drag on a little longer than I had hoped, and by the end of the game it had reached a point where people were spending way too long moving armies around.   

I could be talked into playing it again, but it wouldn't be one I'd ever choose.

First game was tough slogging - the rulebook was interesting to say the least. We laughed at how the rulebook states that Sumer is the only area on the board in which you cannot place workers. Then it mentions in order to begin an empire you need at least one worker in an area and equal to or greater than the next player. So, we were kinda stumped when in the very first turn SUMER was one of the areas you could begin an empire. We basically just began an empire in any Sumer area without having workers there first and called it a house rule - 'SUMER is the only area on the board in which workers are not required to START AN EMPIRE'. Then while trying to find out what happens to the used scribes and toolmakers we came upon the last page of the rulebook where there's this thing called 'Easy to forget rules' and it mentions Sumer is the only area on the board that you can begin an empire without having workers. What a hoot - duh, no kidding that's an easy rule to forget - SINCE WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!! Mr. Wallace get some better proofreaders dude!!

RATING: 5
Very well designed interplay between military and economic concerns.  Plenty of turn angst as you try to get something accomplished before the others shut you down.  Skewing combat so that attacking is always better than defending creates an interesting and aggressive game.  In the end though, I just don't have much fun playing it.  Everything is so well balanced that turns progress very similarly.  I appreciate that it is a fine design and that others will really enjoy it - it's just not the type of game for me.

'Charity' edition. Wow, excellent first impression with a clear hint it may end up higher in my estimation.  

One of our marks of complexity is how soon we reach for the malts - this triggered them before the hour was out; not a record, but at the upper end of the scale, so be warned.  

We started with a 12YO Cadenhead bottling of Royal Lochnagar; even at cask strength this is a vanilla, honeyed, dram which I, personally, could drink to a band playing. 

It was followed by an deeply sherried SMWS bottling of 5YO Arran; while young this was smooth and rich, with a sweet sherry nose and palate, redolent of Dundee cake and barley sugars - with a super, dry, finish typical of oloroso.

We finished with a superb SMWS bottling of Springbank - smoky but smooth - 'a sweet arbroath smokie eaten on the beach' was the unexpected description sugested but I can't do better - that briny smokiness is there - lovely.

Back to the game - two of us loved it while one of us didn't - one decided on 'a nine' early on and didn't change his mind, the other only revealed his reservations at the end, but admitted the game hadn't really 'clicked'.  I'm closer to the 'nine' but can see why not everyone would enjoy this on first encounter.

This is, if you will, a complex malt of a game - not a straightforward, welcoming, Royal Lochnagar, nor is it a sweet and approachable sherried Arran.  This is more akin to the Springbank - perhaps a mite too peaty and smoky on first impression but one which rewards perseverance; revealing a delicious, complex, and tantalising malt which delivers unexpectedly delicious flavours on longer acquaintance.  In other words, this is a game that I think needs to 'click' for you before you'll enjoy it.

OK, cut this out now and send it off to 'Psueds Corner'; I plead guilty but defy anyone to attempt this game and these three malts and not reach the same conclusions!

Strongly recommended, even without the whiskies. 

Evident on further play that previous experience is a big advantage, which can be leveraged into a major points difference.  Not surprising with a game of this weight that it looks like you need to have players with roughly equal experience/expertise to have a balanced game.

I like this one quite a bit!  While it was a little long, I really liked everything else.  With such limited resources, it's really tough to decide how to best use them.  Do I trade them for tools to buy more soldiers with and get points with soldiers, or try to trade them for other luxury goods that will score me points?  Overall, a lot of good decision making.  However, it still suffers from the plight that almost every 3 player game has, which is kingmaking situations.  It's very possible for one player to have to decide the winner.  I doubt it would happen every game though, and I enjoyed the game enough for me to look past it.

An awkward, overstuffed, baffling game.

RATING: 7
First play, we all agreed that we'd misplayed the first third of the game before getting more sense of how to play more effectively. I enjoyed several aspects of the game, but two things kind of disappointed me.

1) The ability to trade pretty much any good for any other good....if you have an adequate network, seemed a little gamey. There are things to disrupt someone else from doing that, and maybe we didn't grasp that soon enough to really benefit.

2) I was expecting more novel mechanics that were "3-player only" balance mechanisms. If they're there, I guess its more subtle than I could appreciate. It really seemed like this game could have easily been a 4p or 2p game, maybe with a different map. In the end, one player was trailing so badly that it created a kingmaker situation. That's exactly the MAIN problem in most 3p games, to my mind. 

I need to play again. I think if the endgame can have all 3 players in the mix, it could be quite tense and more interesting. I expect my rating to move up or down (if more of the same) with repeat playings.

Update:  After a second play I enjoyed the game a great deal more. More variability of strategy suggested itself. I had a much better grasp of the role of military (and its limitations). The resource harvest box didn't seem to dominate as it had in the first game.

RATING: 7
After the Flood is a finely honed, tightly packaged empire game set in ancient Sumer. Designed for only 3 players, AtF gives players a variety of ways to generate VPs, and brings some unique things to the table, all while packing into a relatively compact time frame.

In very broad strokes here's how the game works: Players collect resources based on area majorities in the two basic goods. They then enter the main action phases where they can place traders onto the board using resource cubes, where they can take trade actions to increase the value of their goods, where they can found cities, and where they can found military empires that can ravage the board by restricting trade, trashing cities, or just standing around and collecting VPs.

The scoring is based on a couple of major things. First, building cities by tithing rare resources which are produced via trading. Second, by covering up a lot of real estate with the military empires that are formed.

After the Flood differentiates itself by its empire system, which deserves some explaining. Each round there are 3 potential military empires which are associated with a specific region on the board. Players with a majority or a shared majority of traders present in that area can opt to discard their existent traders and form a military empire there. The military empires are listed on the board, and have a base strength value that tells you how many military worker pieces you will get with them, base. You can then tithe resource cubes to get more pieces, or to upgrade their weaponry. The pieces thus created can then move out onto the board where they can restrict trade (traders in their area shut down, only armies will trade, very important), score VPs, and raze cities (important, you can advantageously raze your opponent's, and sometimes your own cities with this). At the end of each of the 5 rounds, the military pieces are wiped clean though, so even a momentous turn for a given military empire will be short-lived. This system creates much of the game's novelty.

I quite like this game. It has just the right mix of logistics and direct combat type interactions to hit a sweet spot with me. The logistics is not overly complex at a base level, but it is made more complex because of how the players are capable of interfering with you via the military. There are also interesting timing aspects involved in forming an empire, how you use the troops, and other things of that nature.

If you consistently have 3 and are looking for a very well-tuned game for that number, then I give this the thumbs up. It's probably 2 hours with experience, though your first game will run longer, obviously. A very good game though, quite easily the best in the still young Treefrog line. Seems like it will appeal to people who like stuff like Antike a lot. I don't personally care for that particular title, but this has a sort of similar baseline engine in that you have resources and logistics aspects combined with combat. The AtF "wipe the board clean" system seems to mitigate a lot of the typical entrenchment and corner patterns that plague these types of games. Another solid title for Martin Wallace, though, like Josh Miller, I have concerns about its long term fun factor because of the essential sameness of the narrative from one game to another. The ultimate similarity from game to game is why I eventually dropped the rating on this from 8 to 7 and opted to sell my copy. It's not a bad title at all, but it seems to be a bit too scripted for much repeat play, and I absolutely require that games in my collection have replay, as I keep it pruned down so tightly.

On a minor strategic note: don't get behind the 8 ball on textiles and grain in this or you'll be taken to the cleaners. Though they are the least valuable goods, you need a small pile of them to put workers out and to trade up to more valuable things.

After a few false starts, and then a number of full games, After the Flood proved to be a 'typical' Wallace: long playing time, lots of details to work out, all tied together by simple mechanisms. It is by no means a simple game: there was a certain richness of gameplay I hadn't expected while pouring over the rules on many occasions. That said, it was also typical that the length can cause the game to begin to drag on. In games like Age of Steam and Brass there is a certain point where all you do as player is hoarding and making the best of your situation, all the while hoping you do better than your opponents. Liberté has this less, but still the stack of blocks to place can prove quite large, and if at some point it becomes apparent that the game is not going to end via a sudden death-victory the losers are in for a long haul. After the Flood sees a lot of ebb and flood of soldiers, workers and cities, but there is little sense of progression, of matters becoming more or less difficult... although there is a certain 'flow' to the entire affair. I think a game of this length needs such a 'story arc' to keep the players occupied—even though I absolutely hate using the term. But if I have to use it, games by Wallace are a fitting accompaniment.

Despite the lack of the story arc, there are certainly some recurring patterns visible. Popular is pre-positioning workers as to grab a juicy empire in the next round, and relying on soldiers to do the trading, and blocking others from doing so. Timing can be of the essence here—and thus passing order, and thus sacrificing a valuable resource. Another popular strategy is positioning yourself in Dilmun because soldiers cannot attack you here—yet there is a grim reaper active in round 4 which sees you losing all workers there. It's all in little differences: the special powers of cities may not look like much, but they can be very useful under the right circumstances. Southern Sumeria tends to see less soldiers than northern Sumeria—and it is in northern Sumeria that the most obviously powerful properties are to be found. The dynamics are subtle, but they are there nonetheless.

Scoring is another thing which surprises me. In the games I played to date we usually ended up within 5 to 10 points of each other. That doesn't look like much, but if you realise that at some point point differences of 40 units or more existed... There is absolutely no guarantee that doing well in the early game means you'll do well in the late game. I attribute this to the player dynamics: someone in the front is obviously the leader so should be reigned in, but there is no point in beating a dead horse because the other live horse may gallop you straight by in the process. You cannot play this game individually. If you can, the others deserve to lose.

I was very worried about the dreaded stalling strategy, but it just didn't appear. The main reason is that waiting and stalling can only happen [i]with respect to the others[/i]. If one player is doing exessive trade-throughs and repeated expand empire-actions, then he is using up his resources much quicker than the others. [i]Then[/i] it makes sense for those others to wait up and trample his sorry efficient ass. The remedy is simple: don't try to wait. Competent players will catch what you're doing and match their playing tempo to yours; and you [i]must[/i] do something. Trade eventually runs out, workers too. And then it's the soldiers' turn. Again, the dynamics of this game are such that you cannot play on your own. The downside of the game is that matters are a tad slow at times, with small trades and small empire expansions. This isn't a dramatic prehistoric game of fast-paced trade and conquest. But don't underestimate the impact of [i]gote[/i] and [i]sente[/i] either. Doing something elaborate [i]right now[/i] will cost you, and it is always good to consider whether those resources do not deliver elsewhere.

All in all me appreciation for this title is growing the more I play it. I like discovering its subtleties, and look forward to the moment I can truly try an interesting variant, like changing the timing of the arrival of the various empires. Upgraded the rate to a 7.

I do not like that one of the dominant strategies is to stall. Ignore upgrading cities, get a military advantage (better equipped + excessive number of units), stall till both other players pass, then clean up the board getting a larger swing on points then upgrading the cities. 

Makes the game drag out unnecessarily sometimes. 

Probably will not play again unless the group really wanted to.

Another great Wallace title. It combines a great and difficult to manage economic theme (2 kind of resources available to you as direct production and more available only via trading) with another perfect empire building/rising/declining engine (and another dicey mechanic for winning battles). The only culprit is the number of player: only for 3 plrs.

I really like the theme, ideas and mechanisms of this game. However, somehow, it does't work very well. Probably the biggest flaw is the way the empires are handled. Furthermore the strategy seems to be very scripted. First turns: build cities and buildings. Last turn: build big armies.

Ordered on 11/04/2008, arrived on 11/13/2008.  

I ordered After the Flood directly from Treefrog in Great Britain. It was the first board game I ordered from Europe, and the first Martin Wallace title I owned. I got it mostly because of intense interest in the time period, and because the game itself sounded very, very interesting.

The game seemed reasonably balanced and engaging but failed to capture my imagination. After three plays I found myself without the desire to bring it to the table and ultimately traded it away. I am still not sure if this was the right decision, but I do not really regret.

I was pleasantly surprised by my first playing of After the Flood.  It's either the best Wallace game since Brass or the best one since Age of Steam.

The project to design 3-player games is a good idea, though tricky to implement.  After the Flood immediately made me think of The End of the Triumvirate, but it works a lot better, with rules that fit together nicely.  It does have some of the "you and him fight" aspect that 3-player games tend to have, but there's also a nice ebb and flow in the need to balance trading with military action.

After the Flood is worker placement, set collection through trading, and military expansion. All of these aren't particularly new, but they way they are combined here makes for a pretty unique game.

Worker placement is the basis for everything. You don't get resources without workers, cannot trade without workers, and you cannot build armies without workers. There are two very distinct strategies, one being trading for resource sets and using them to build up your cities to earn VP, or buying armies and expanding your empire which will also earn you VP. Neither of these is possible completely without the other, and while the approaches are very different the scores are always very close.

We got a few rules wrong on our first play (partly corrected during the game) which probably had a significant impact on our final results. Even so, up until the final scoring round all players were within inches of each other. This great balance is also the reason that two players ganging up on the third doesn't seem to be a problem. You always need to think about your own needs, too, and actions are just too precious to waste them on merely destructive moves.

The rating may well go up further when played correctly.

Final comment:  I bought it, played it a few times and sold it off.  For the game length, there just wasn't enough there, there.  

[b]Primary complaint (and the thing, at the core that I think probably turned me off on the game):[/b] everything is so incremental - each action (100-150 of them, per game, per player) is so small that it seems to take forever for things to develop.  Pair that up with a 2-4 hour game length and you've got a problem.

I guess I prefer games that have fewer, more meaningful actions - even if those games might take an equal amount of time to complete (e.g. Age of Steam).

---------

Update: Dropped my rating to a 6 and traded it away.  The decision involved in play just aren't as compelling as I initially thought. Also a strategy focused on doing as little as possible as slowly as possible seems to dominate.  Somewhat plodding and repetative.  False alarm.  Move along....

-----------

I can't stop thinking about this game!  I haven't played it enough to go higher, so I'm starting it at an 8.

Empire building and conflict are the heart of the game. Timing when / where / how to do it may be where the most important decisions lie.

The bits are fabulous: beautiful and functional.

RATING: 7
Short version: very good game, but probably won't be an evergreen.

Long version: I enjoy After the Flood for two reasons. First of all, it's a game with real finesse. The timing and pacing decisions are interesting. Sometimes, you want to make every effort to be rush ahead with something before the window of opportunity closes. Other times, you'd rather play a game of chicken and wait as long as possible. The game is a series of little jockeying moves, setting up threats and counterthreats, and trying to stay mobile and flexible enough to respond to your opponents' moves. There's a lot going on all at once, all of it intertwined. You're competing to produce goods, to upgrade them at various board locations, to get the biggest and best army, to conquer territory, to build cities in safe and/or powerful areas, and to place a majority of workers in certain areas.

The second reason I enjoy After the Flood is the way that it handles the classic problems of a three player game of conflicts. The players do not have permanent military forces or borders in this game. Empires rise and fall quickly in different parts of the board, much like in History of the World or Britannia. You don't even necessarily know which empires will be controlled by which players. This fluid, chaotic structure makes it impossible for one player to get squeezed out of the game. You may be getting pounded this turn, but next turn you could just as easily be the one doing the pounding.

My one concern here is replayability. I've played three times so far, and enjoyed each game. Will I still enjoy it after three more plays? I don't know, but I suspect I'll be tired of it by then. For all its subtlety, it's basically the same game each time. There is some variability with the attack die rolls, but I doubt that's enough to dramatically change the complexion from game to game. After the Flood relies on players trying different strategies for its replayability. I can easily see the same group of players getting in a rut if they played it repeatedly. My prediction is that After the Flood will be the type of game that gets played several times, then relegated to the shelf or the trade pile.

[Update] That's exactly what happened.  After four plays, I feel like I've explored everything here, and I've traded the game.  Lowered the rating by one point as a compromise between initial enjoyment and current desire to play.

It's another game that rewards careful resource planning as the system is not forgiving. It's very tight and one cube decides over an action and an action can decide your success.

Only played one game, and the point spread was rather large...  Mechanics seem a bit odd, especially the armies, which appear à-la [thing=224][/thing], except the armies disappear at the end of every turn...  Felt more like a sub-game, although this IS how one scores VPs prior to turn 5.

The dice combat system seemed useless and adds randomness in order to force players to expend resources.

Will probably be replaying this again, to see if we did something wrong, as this one really did not impress me (which usually means it will not be played again).

Typically Martin Wallace is either brilliant or terrible. However this one is just a bit "meh". It feels like they went to proof before finishing testing.

Cities/developments need more to them. Battles shouldn't favour the attacker so much - it results in people wanting to hold back in a round to be the attackers rather than setting up a defensive position. Changing to 6+/8+ would fix that.

House ruling the turn order makes sense.

OK, I'll admit that I'm a Wallace zombie. The dude makes games I like playing; so sue me!

I think AtF does a great job at balancing militarism and mercantilism, and the passing mechanic, where you can keep taking actions after passed opponents if you pay for 'em, is brilliant. In any Wallace resources are tight, and here you've really gotta keep an eye on the resources you're producing each turn; if you get stuck on the ass-end, you can get hosed fast.

Mmm... The delicious horror of too few actions, too few resources...

I've played with & without the variant & I'm not sure whether it's necessary.  I'm going to start playing this online now so keen to see how that goes.

Combat is very important: there's a 58% or 83% chance of causing a 4 or 5 point swing with each attack.  Towards the end of the game that kind of means you've got to calculate who's winning & attack appropriately.  Until then I don't mind playing by gut.  Of course, 3p works well with this since you can gang up on the leader in most situations (as long as all players have played well enough to keep it tight until the end).

And Assyria really is in a good position for the army in the last round.

UPDATE: OK, played this a bit more & I've decided it has to have the variant to deal with the delaying tactic.  Won't play without it now.

Rating is for playing with the variant, otherwise it would probably be a 3 or so.

A reasonable take on the Civilization genre, but  the designer has made the classic mistake of setting a conflict game on a long, slender land mass that means players at opposite ends cannot attack each other. Whatever you do, don't fall behind in the grain and textile boxes as there's no 'catch up' mechanism later and once you've got fewer resources than the others you're screwed. After initial interest this crashed and burned quite badly for me. It's an oddball majority game with dice-based combat, but there are no competing strategies. Why wouldn't you want the biggest army for instance? The restriction to 3 players and the long playing time means that I won't be seeking this one out again.

Could go higher.  Its long, probably a touch too long.  But as Perikles is an interesting mix between a light wargame and an election game, After the Flood is an interesting cross between a light wargame and a resource development game.  The interplay between armies and the economy is particularly novel, and unlike anything I've seen before.  

Still, its a 3 hour game easy.  I am not sure it packs the punch to hit the table too often with that time frame.  Had I more confidence on that front, it would be an 8.

Wallace shows it again: the game is original, unique and feels very fresh.  It presents agonizing decisions as resources are multi-purpose. Generally - 'wow!' effect at first.

BUT:
- balance of the game is seriously skewed towards the military approach.  There AREN'T two equally strong strategies: military and expanding cities.  Even if you plan to focus on expanding cities, you HAVE TO care greatly about military aspect, otherwise you might wake up with no cities to expand... :>
And the mechanics strongly suggests that both strategies should be valid alternatives.  They are not.  When somebody starts an arms race, everybody _has_ to follow and expanding cities is non-existent then...
You can win with military force and not expanding the cities, but you cannot win with expanding the cities and not taking care too much about armies.

- the game is too long (3-4h) for the experience it delivers.  Many micro-moves of players contribute to that.

- the game might be tedious, because of these many micro-moves and generally not rewarding enough for the effort of performing them


[POSITIVE NOTE: After 5 plays I don't find strategy of 'passing-as-the-last-in-a-turn-at-all-cost' as ruining the game or even a problem (as some people complain).  Personally I recognize the power of passing as last (and there ARE periods of micro-steps during particular turns), but I have doubts about receiving great advantage when every player pursuits this strategy.  It seems the game self-regulates in this area, when everybody watches the others and tries not to pass too early.  It seems it *can* be controlled as people who play after the 1st player has passed have to pay for this.  This payment is NOT so insignificant, so it's enough to pass when you see that others can perform only ~2-3 more actions (considering this payment).]

Sold.

A long and intense game. Mechanics work well, and there is a lot to think about. Nice, typically Wallace'sque mix of euro (resource collection) and territorial wargame. A lot of aggression, so if you don't like seeing your armies defeated and your cities burned, for god's sake stay away! My one play (so far) was exhausting but it left me impressed. Thematically very strong, even for a Wallace game.

An unusual blend of resource trading and warring that is specifically geared to work well with 3-players. The mechanics seemed a bit alien at first, but grew on us as we played. By the time we finished, we were quite fascinated with the inter-relationships between the different elements. More plays are needed to determine if there is a dominant strategy, but looks very promising so far!

I like the idea of a three player only game. I like games about ancient civilizations. I like Martin Wallace games. So why am I luke warm about this game? 

I think for these reasons. I don't often get to play with three. I usually play with two or four or more. Three is a number I am least likely to play with. Whilst it's no Tigris and Euphratis in it's lightweight theme, it left me feeling a little detached. And I think I might have OD'd on Martin Wallace. I went through a stage of buying all his games I could find. Martin's games are usually fairly complex with a lot of fiddly rules and I think I am getting a bit fed up with too many fiddly rules and this has loads.

I don't dislike this game but since my only play, whatever mood I have been in this has not been high on my list of games to play.

[b]Completely New Comment [1-28-11][/b]

I've played After the Flood twice, and I think I completely misunderstood it the first time. The game is billed as a 3-player only resource-conflict hybrid. That is, one fully developed layer of the game involves gathering and improving (trading up) resources. It's a pretty large pool: grain, textiles, wood, metal, tools, oil, gold, and lapis lazuli. The other layer involves raising armies and taking over big expanses of territory on the board. At first, the main connection between these two brands of gameplay seems to be cities. Sets of resources (which are quite difficult to assemble) can be used to expand cities, and this is a major scoring option. Armies can be sent it to burn down cities (pre-emptively, as expansion can't be negated after the fact) and to claim new sites for buildings. Some points also scale with the number of territories under control. 

So it looks like players are either revving a resource engine to expand cities, going on the warpath, or finding some balance between the two. But really that mischaracterizes the game severely. 

Here's the real deal: 

After the Flood is a game that throws players head-first into a system that is [i]constantly degrading[/i]. [i]All parts of this system are interconnected[/i] such that armies, resources, workers, actions, and opportunity cost are all pegged to a central, nebulous "value." And this value is constantly slipping through players' fingers, for two main reasons. First, players begin the turn with a small income of textiles and grain, and though these resources can be upgraded several times over (all the way to Lapis Lazuli), the players can never exceed the number of goods they began the round with. Better, not more. However, once a single player passes, the other two players must spend [i]something[/i] for each additional action taken. This means that players could invest most of their turn upgrading their initial goods, only to find that they must now fritter those goods away in order to partially implement their original plan. 

In other words, the opportunity cost of upgrading your resources is huge, so chasing the higher values of tools, oil, gold, and lapis lazuli can be akin to pursuing a mirage. 

The military component of the game starts out as an alternative scoring path but, the in last two turns (2/5), becomes a balancing mechanism to keep leaders in check. After the Flood is brutally unforgiving, so it's usually clear who has "won" by the end of turn three. That forces the other players to resort to raw military aggression, so the game becomes a question of whether the leader can hold out. All this does is make the game quite close when the music stops. 

The first three turns are much more interesting than the last two. But overall, the fundamental, defining feature of this game is that everyone is slowly bleeding, and it's up to the players to bandage the wounds as best they can. It is one of the toughest systems I've ever played. I can respect those first three turns, but find them exhausting. The last two turns are a lot less distinctive and engaging. 

I can't help but feel that there's an amazing game waiting to break out here. The incarnation that Wallace published isn't worth it for me.

Needs repeated plays to make the best of it, and its not going to get them.

Ok game of building empires and having them swept away with scoring through area control or resource gathering.  Sadly the luck of the dice can be slightly overwhelming for such an otherwise lengthy and meaty game. I'm not adverse to luck and dice (often I prefer them) but here they seem out of place.

While I enjoy Wallace's economic games I'm not so fond of his conflict games. This one was a positive surprise for me. The tight three player constellation avoids that a player falls hopelessly behind and also avoids that the leader before the last turn of a game is the sure loser because there are only two players bashing him. Rules weren't as confusing as I thought and I couldn't find any of the typical odd design decisions Wallace usually takes.

I enjoyed playing this more than I expected.  I'm not too excited by the theme, but at least it's a little bit novel.  I like the management portion of the game, the combat is definitely important, but I like how it plays a smaller role than in, say, Perikles.  It is a little rules heavy, but that is nothing new for a Wallace game.  Once you get it down, it seems fairly easy to play.  My main problem is that my opponents were not thrilled by the game, and that it might be a little difficult to have 3 players willing to play it.

RATING: 8
A game of the ebb and flow of empires in and around Sumer.  There's quite a bit of resource management and a low-level of wargamey-ness involved.  Military units acquired from era to era, ebb and flow so they are never carried-forward, unlike most wargames, since each era is several hundred years.  Calculating all the resources that you need is like doing mental gymnastics or flowcharting and does require some planning or calculated thinking involved (is the most difficult aspect in the game, at least for me).  You also have to allocate your Workers well to plan for military & resource claims.  Most cities have a unique special ability/power when you control it and each era has advantageous armies w/ different startup locations.  So, selecting, claiming and maintaining any/all of these could be key to whatever strategies you pursue.  I found that the "A attacks B, and C attacks A to win" triangle problem was a non-issue with respect to this type of 3-player game.  It's fairly deep but not overly complex and our first game clocked in at about 3hrs w/ learning.  If you want a rich, deep and balanced 3-player game in your collection then ATF will probably fit that bill.

RATING: 7
I really enjoyed this game and the interweaving of the different mechanisms/options during the player turn.  The empire decline is just brutal if one doesn't take care, particularly since linen is impossible to come by other than at the beginning of the turn.  Wiping out opposing players' unfinished cities can be really brutal for the opponents if they are not in a position to prevent it.  Initially, the game is very overwhelming, but after the first couple rounds, it becomes pretty smooth as you get a good feel for how the game works.

It is way complex, but most rules are written on the board, so that helps.

It is way complex, a little less than Brass, a whole lot more than Tinners Trail and Steel Driver.

It is way complex, and I did not find, that it added to the experience - in short it seems to me to be complex, because it really wants to be complex. But I respect that some players actually like complexity, more or less in itself.

It is way complex, and I must say, that I now know, that I prefer simpler games with equal or deeper gameplay.

It is way complex, but fortunately I am too busy most of the summer to show up at our weekly gamesessions, so the rest of my group can play this as much as they want ... until I return and force them back into the narrow confines of Chvatil, Rosenberg and their ilk.

I think the conclusion is, that even though it is not made for me, then I can still appreciate the massive skill it requires to make such a game and the result is so hardcore its daunting.

Not as scary as the back of the box makes out, once you get your bearings it is fairly intuitive. The main problem for first time gamers is that resources are not gained through production but by 'trading up'. I really like this mechanism, which is a great reflection of ancient Sumer.

I should have liked this more than I did given that I like interaction and conflict even in my euros, but this just didn't grab me in my first play. I think the game is simply too incremental. Many turns are simply - trade one cube, trade one cube, trade different cube, place one soldier . . . it takes five or six turns seemingly to accomplish even very small tasks. It was also far too long for what it was although I could see play time decreasing substantially with more plays.

Rank unfortunately going down from 8. You ALWAYS want to be the last to move, that's why you need big armies (not to fight, but to pay with them after somebody passed). For the whole turn you make small moves, just to longer your ability to perform further actions - that's something opposite to author description,  optimizing actions. Our game was very long and bit frustrating.

01/03/09 Played once. The production value of this game is high. I like the theme and it has some interesting aspects. Its not quite a brain burner. But for a Euro/war game hybrid I feel it just takes waaaaaay too long (3.7 hours). A lot of that feeling comes from the down time. I agree with some on BGG who called it "clunky, awkward, inelegant, and unforgiving". A few months ago I had thought of buying it. I'm now glad I didn't. Oh I'll probably play it again. Its very hard to find three-player only games. But I won't be clamoring for it.

RATING: 8
Another strong Wallace offering with a lot happening and various paths for success.  Players vie for resources and then work to upgrade those resources (8 in total) through various trade mechanics.  Some regions allow for trade if you have a merchant there but an opponent's military presence in that same region will allow him/her to trade and keep you from trading.  Grain can be traded for wood or metal.  Metal can be made into tools for trade or increasing army size.  Gold, Oil, Lapis can upgrade cities for VPs, etc.  

Each turn a player starts an empire, brings that empire onto the board and then decides whether to increase the size of the army and how to equip it.  Basically here you put down a one-time bid for your army's strength.  Usually the best empire available goes to the first person who takes this action.  However, subsequent empires may start with less armies but can come onto the board stronger by increasing the previous bid.  During fighting if a player has a better army than the defender than they hit on 5s and above otherwise they hit on 7s. A 58% versus 83% chance of success which is significant.  Armies are used to take over territory, defend cities, etc. & leave the board at the end of each era.

I've only covered a small portion of what players are competing for.  There's a nice ebb and flow to the game.  It melds economics and military choices decisions well and should usually take 3 hours to play (probably more with my game groups) as there is a lot to think about.

this game gets a bit of a bad rap.  lots of subtleness with gears moving in the background.  ebb and flow of armies and players as if you want to score, it might prevent you from having as many options for the next turn or two.

avoid playing with anyone with AP (might be true for most games), but this can hum along with everyone making an effort to move the process along.  should clock in 2hrs.

Finally got a chance to play the game properly and was very impresssed. This is a resource management game which is extremely tight even by Martin Wallace standards. The basic currency of the game is grain and textiles which can be used to upgrade to other resources and ultimately armies, workers and expand cities. Victory points are scored for army occupation of territories and developed cities. Because armies are removed at the end of each turn and decline (ie the removal of the majority of workers)occurs in turn 2 and 4, each turn plays like a mini-game. Also, each turn has its own flavour - eg Turn 1 is all about building cities and trading with very little conflict whilst turn 4 is aggressively militaristic. There are a myriad of choices to make and my feeling is that with repeated plays a number of routes to victory could be established. Like Brass, I think this game will be a grower with more and more people realising the subtle intricacies and strategies. However, unlike Brass, there's not enough copies out there to build momentum. As a result, with many people only playing one or two games, it will have to languish as a lost minor gem.

Very odd...a 3-player Wallace empire builder set in ancient Sumeria...should have been a total play and order the next day for me, but actually no.  For those of us with a deficient Euro-strategy gene, there's no catch-up mechanism at all.  There is really one main path to victory, so those looking for alternate routes are stymied.  Finally, unlike Wallace's best strategy games, many of the design decisions don't make sense thematically.  I never got a very strong sense of time or place, and it certainly didn't teach me anything about Sumerian history or culture.  Struggle of Empires or Perikles this is not!

Very chess-like 3 player take on History of the World. The way all the mechanics come together is pretty cool, but I can already see this getting very samey very fast. There is hardly any randomness here save for the dry combat system which is weighted pretty heavily towards the attacker. This is something I'll probably try out a couple more times maybe, then move on.

This is a game in which early mistakes will lead to long term misery, and it has an extremely tight economy which allows major investments to go completely down the crapper thanks to a string of low rolls on 2d6.  (Giving your army the best equipment often means they'll just leave behind the shiniest debris when they get slaughtered by Lady Luck's caprices.)  I wanted to like it, but it really amounts to little more than a lot of fuss and bother over two relatively straightforward scoring mechanisms.  It's one of Martin Wallaces's lesser efforts.

Interesting game, sometimes tense to play, but with some problems. 

It seems more tactical than strategical: there is not so much story. Each turn is almost independent from the others; not completely, but a bit too much for my taste. I prefer to have a game in which an important move in one turn really "shapes" the rest of the game and not only in the possibility to win or not. Instead this game seem to give more importance to the single tactical choice, still depending by the context, but with too short "memory".

The real problem seem to be that, contrary to what the designer suggests, it is better to pass as last as possible. If you pass as first the other players may ruin your position completely. The price to pay for each further move after someone passes doesn't balance things enough. 

So what happens is that there is a common strategy adopted: trying to postpone the moment you pass, making very "small" actions. As a consequence, the workers are placed in the only place where they can't be attacked : only one worker in this safe area, and you can do all your trade, as slowly as possible. The other areas on the board are almost ignored when you have to place workers (with some exception: like in the end when they are worth points, or because there is a single area that can give a valuable good or to start a new empire). 

So the game becomes a fight to be the last to pass and mostly a military game. The tactical choices, most based on timing, are not the ones I like.

Still not a bad game, with tense moments and still worth to try, but not the best of Wallace, IMHO.

Rating after having studied carefully rules and strategy and having played 3 times.
The game is too much on military and the author's suggested strategy to optimize everything and try to end the turn quickly does not work. 
All the plays turned out to be a drop by drop slow down in order to try to be the last player and invade as many regions as possible.
If I have to spend 20 minutes moving one cube after another just to try to be the last in the next 1 minute of actions, I would prefer to play tic-tac-toe.

Martin Wallace scores big time with this one. A heavier title that takes the better part of a game to understand how the different parts inter-relate. Timing is a big part of effective play. Once you understand how it all comes together, it is a VERY entertaining ride.  Another play or 2 to confirm my initial impressions and I'm confident it will break into my top 10.  A half point deduction for game length (3+ hours).

A solid and interesting game, although I feel it gets a too samey in the last hour - exaggerating, but you're playing the same game 5 times with some variance between start positions depending on what resources you retain from the previous turn. I'm not a fan of the need to delay actions to meet the seemingly powerful need to go last into the resources boxes, which are crucial for the following turn. I like how the aggressor is rewarded with the armies, but this again seems to favour the late-player (especially when coupled with the resources to buy extra units). The game  makes me wonder about different strategies, but I'm not sure I want to play it again too quickly, given I feel I've played it 5 times in one play already.

I thoroughly enjoyed my first play of this. 

It reminded a little bit of HotW, which is great, because HotW would suck with three, and this really nailed it for 3p.

Was 3 hours, but that was first time plays for everyone. And for that time, I was completely engrossed in this game.

The win went to the player that most effectively balanced the economic and warring engines, and adjusted to the other players tactics.  What more could you ask in a game?

Update 3/14- 2nd play at GS. This is really half economic trading, then half military action. Each phase, you struggle to get the material needed to either cap your ziggurats (or whatever they're called) and get workers on the board, and a race to establish the best army and get it established on board, then race to pass to it costs everyone else a wood to keep going. I didn't see that til half into play today.

After one play of AFTER THE FLOOD the "9" got to be counted as a very preliminary rating. Especially since the gameplay felt very complex during the first turn. Even though I figured out how to build some strategies later on, I still don't really know the nature of this beast just yet. But learning to play the game was a very exciting and rewarding expericence. Ratings may go up or down with furter plays...

Wallace should stick to economic games. There's nothing special here, just mediocre combat mechanics and a rudimentary "trade this for that" system. The complexity of the rules belie the depth of the game. It really didn't seem much more complicated than "Start big army, collect resources to improve cities, rinse, repeat."

That said, I've played this thing once with all noobs. Would like to try again and see if I've missed a gem.

Edit: I have played this a couple more times, and my opinion of the game hasn't improved.

Rule intensive and takes time to digest, which is similar to most other Wallace games. I thought this was a 7 for production value and I really like the Theme personally. But as a game I would only give this about a 5. Too bad, I was dissapointed since I normally like Wallace games. This just felt clunky and ackward, there was no flow to the game or originality. There was basically a set pattern of actions that had to be executed by everyone. Rinse and repeat. Everyone would trade for the same resources every turn. Everyone would upgrade cities. Everyone would try to start the strongest empire first just to grab as much land as possible for victory points. Next turn same thing. Didn't have any fun, just felt like going through the motions. Too bad since I was looking forward to a good meaty three player game, since this is a niche that needs more games.

3p-only game that is more of a Euro than a game of conflict. Worker placement, resource production, trading, and area-control form the heart of the game. City building, armies, and expansion facilitate victory point scoring. The rules are clear and very well-written, a classic Treefrog/Wallace design.

RATING: 4
Revised rating down after fourth game. Has serious runaway leader issues. The triple-power of the kingdom armies (kill, trade, stall) means whoever gets the big kingdoms wins. 

If a player comes out of the 1st round with more resources, and first shot at the big kingdom in the 2nd round, you may as well call it.

=====================================================

Played three times now, and my rating settles in at a 7.

Some really ingenious mechanics. Lots to think about.

However, there isn't a whole lot of long-term planning, or real empire-building. It's all about tempo, efficiency, and tactical targetted aggression.

RATING: 8.5
Woah, this game is hard. 

It is difficult balance trying to spend to get workers on the board, spend to trade up, spend to increase your army strength, spend to start successful empires, spend for resources, spend for special actions, spending for the next turn order and oof spending when others have passed.  How can you afford to do everything that you need to do? You can't, it's a Martin Wallace game.  

It is tough to wrap you head around how these completely independent seeming systems are all intertwined.  At times, as a coping mechanism, I had to see the whole thing in the abstract. Because of this, it feels removed from theme at times, but then I found myself back buying into the illusion.  I found this game intensely engaging. 

I tend to be a very impulsive player. It is very easy to make an accounting mistake and leave yourself without the ability to do essential things, like say, starting an empire and earning VPs.  I can be a big dummy, but even when you are in last place it is fun to figure out how to get back into the game. This is cruel puzzle, but what is fantastic is that you can come back.  So the cruelty makes the game even more rewarding. 

Note to future self: Place the cubes on the workers as you are trading up, this will prevent you from being a big fat cheater.

It has a tough learning curve.  Not nearly as accessible as the other games in the Treefrog line. This is the kind of game that requires a practice game.  You really can hose yourself, so you need to let it go and just make mistakes. 

I could see my rating on this go up, especially when coupled with homemade cards for the controlled cities with their powers on them so that you don't forget to take advantage of them.

RATING: 7
Like Liberté and Byzantium, players don't represent a particular faction/nation. Instead, like Vinci, the game covers a long period of history (~1500 years in this case) and players temporarily control empires as they rise; they score VP at the end of each turn (~150 years), when the empires fall. Players start with several resources and 2 workers in their available stock, and workers in the irrigation and weaving boxes. 

See http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/340154 for initial impressions.

Still deciding about this one. It seems very tight and very original, once again. I just don't know if I like the transition period where you lose almost everything you've built on the previous turn (armies). I'm not fancy about wargames and this one doesn't seem like being clearly one although it has its moments. It also seemed a bit too long. Have to play it again.

I think I have for the collection feeling because it's not an easy game to put in the table. I've played the game for almost two years now and I really want to play it again now. I may find it better now after all this time. We're all different players now and that's important for judgement.

Very much like way Euro mechanics works with the theme of rise and fall of empires. Probably needs 3 or 4 plays to get best out of it - which might prove difficult as it is 3 player only. However, probably worth the effort. The conflict of empires makes the game quite tense and interactive.

In first impression is good, but the game itself has some quirks.

Gameplay is somewhat obtuse - it's easy to understand the mechanics of what you can do, but not at all apparent how you piece things together into a "plan".  I've played this one online several times, and while it should have the attributes to make that a great way to play it (longer play time, lots of thought between turns), it doesn't gel that way.  Finally got to play a F2F game, and it was much more coherent, especially by the end of the game.

I think this game could be an 8 or even a 9 if you had 3 experienced players and played it regularly.  For most people, playing it once or twice, it may be a bit of a head scratcher.

After the Flood was yet another quirky combination of traditional German-style mechanics with wargame mechanics, reminiscent of Wallace’s Byzantium (2005) and Perikles (2006) because both of those games were also quirky Euro-wargame hybrids. After the Flood has resource management and converting resources into victory points through various combinations, but it also has direct player-to-player combat, albeit very simple combat. In each of the 5 rounds, players will likely raise an army and march across Sumeria to claim as many territories as possible (worth 2 victory points each if held at the end of the round). When you create your army you “equip” it by discarding resources. The value of the discarded resources will create a hierarchy of player’s armies with those discarding a more valuable assortment of resources fielding stronger armies. When you attack an army stronger than your own then you need to roll at least a 7 on two dice to win, and when you attack an army weaker than your own then you only need to roll at least a 5 to win. It’s that simple. As you can calculate, the attacking army wins more often than not, regardless of whether it’s stronger or weaker, although even more so when it’s stronger obviously. This makes the board fairly fluid as the armies conquer and re-conquer each other. Then suddenly the year ends, each player gets 2 victory points per territory they occupy, and all of the armies are wiped off the board. This process repeats 5 times and then the game ends (about 3 hours later). It’s an interesting and somewhat intriguing game, but didn’t grab me in the same way that Byzantium did. Byzantium is another quirky three-player (much better with three than with four in my view) Wallace Euro-wargame hybrid, but I’ve played Byzantium five times now over the past few years and it has become one of my favorite Wallace games (behind Age of Steam and possibly Liberte). I won’t go into too much detail on Byzantium here, but the most interesting concept in the game is that players control both the Byzantine and the Arab sides of the conflict, scoring victory points for fielding armies on both sides, and then add their points together at the end (unless you score more than twice as many for one army, in which case you don’t get to count the points for your weaker army, which encourages balanced growth like in Tigris & Euphrates or Ingenious, although not requiring nearly as much balance as those games since you don’t simply count the lower of your scores). The verdict is that I’d play After the Flood again, but don’t feel the need to own it, especially given the fact that I already own Byzantium and Perikles, which scratch a vaguely similar itch.

Another brilliant game by Martin Wallace. Components are top notch. The game is a delicate balance that you have to keep between military expansion and trade. Many tough decisions. You need to realize the limited number of resources that you have available in each turn. The theme blends perfectly with the game mechanics. It is a 3 hour game for 3 players but it worth to play it. And you will play it again!

A good game, with solid mechanics, as one came from expect from Martin Wallace. The design made some really smart choices (the way the army uses one or other type of weapons/material; how the resources are used; and also the scoring - since, from one phase to the other, you score and leave the place).

A fine design, but my only one play wasn't really good, so I'm not particularly interested in return to it.

My first play, I was amazed at how rich you are on the first turn and how impoverished you are afterwards. It's so important to get ahead and stay ahead in weaving and irrigation, that I worry that that might be the whole game right there.

Tasty, robust, and intensive, in that way that Wallace games often are.  There are complex interactions between your workers, your raw materials, your armies, and your trade goods.  Managing your empire requires fine-tuning your turn, and keeping a close eye on your opponents.  Certainly this is a good three-player game, joining [gameid=20134] as the best games I know of for three.  If this game had wider distribution, it would be regularly in the discussion as one of Wallace's best wargame/euro hybrids.

Production is a nasty little beast that you need to keep up with or you will fall behind permanently.  Unlike most games, military has absolutely no function in getting you raw materials.  Still, as long as you understand this and don't allow yourself to fall completely behind, this game is very tight.

During a handful of plays I've gone back and forth on how I feel about this game. There are some interesting timing elements and as a whole the experience is pretty unique, but in the end the game is just too Sisyphean for me. Gains are painfully incremental, which is only exacerbated by the way the board resets after each turn. At five turns the game just becomes too repetitive and long for what it is. I would play if asked, but my own curiosity to further explore this game has run its course.

There are certain games that get a decent rating from me and then I never, ever get the urge to play them again.  This is one such example.  (Rise of Empires, as it happens, is another.)  The strategic focus on resources is not a big plus, to be sure.

Also, I never thought I'd say this, but I'm becoming more and more intolerant of Mr. Wallace's lax approach to rules authoring and readability.  I once considered myself a huge fan, but now I actively avoid buying his games - or even opening his rulebooks - because there is a 100% certainty that the rules will be sufficiently vague or incomplete that I'll be forced to dig through the rules forums for clarifications, and I just don't have the patience for that anymore.

There's also a nonzero chance that something in a complicated Wallace game "approaches" brokenness.  (Bulgars? Byzantium?  Ring a bell?)

OK, this isn't really the appropriate place for this rant.  But I hope you catch my drift.

Rating is after just one play via internet (on Slothninja), so take it with a grain of salt.

It's kind of complex in ways. Partly area majority. Partly economic engine. Partly fighting, complete with dice rolling. Overall it seemed too complex for the payoff, but I feel like I could be wrong and that after another few games I could really see something great in there.

Martin Wallace 3 player game. Quite long.

An above average Martin Wallace game (the only games of his I really like are Age of Steam and Moongha Invaders).  Rules are pretty clean and playable.  Made for 3 players, which is nice.  Not something I'd seek out, but I'm happy to play.  Seem to be multiple ways to win.

Nice game. Little too heavy on mechanisms though. Could me a little more fast paced by removing an mechanism.......

OK, we screwed up a lot in the first part of our first play, but we all dug it by the end, and looked forward to trying it again, with comprehension and inklings of strategy.  Subsequent plays have proven interesting.

a worker placement game with a touch of wargame - definitely distinct from what we have seen. I like it very much

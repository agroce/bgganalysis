Not a fan of Berg designs but had to give this one a go. Looks good overall but I do wish the artist hadn't used the slightly tacky embossed/shadow effect on the land. Much fun to be had with the game but unfortunately the rules are, as is common with Berg, clunky, ad-hoc and inelegant. This manifests particularly in the various status tracks, which are a mess.

I like this very much.  It has depth and subtlety.  The rules are cleanly written and it plays very well.  The Play Book helps a great deal.  The map's lovely, too.  I agree that it's as much of an experience and a system as a game - but I think that's no bad thing.  There are a few ways of gaining points and victory, but you need to be as aware of what the other players are doing as you are of your own plan.

I've played as each side and the problems and challenges are all very different.  That adds an enormous amount of reply value.  If you're the East, you will maybe have a slow burner and need to be opportunistic.  Events will often be against you, but your strategic position is quite good. If you are Rome you need to take as many neutral territories as you can early on and hope you are left alone long enough to become a powerhouse. If you play Greece, you'd better be a really good diplomat as you are in a weak strategic position and need to make sure you don't fight The east and Rome simulataneously.  On the other hand, the sea is your friend more than anyone else's - use the very powerful galleys well and you can prosper.  If you're Carthage, you start in an intially good position but need to be aware that your chances of fighting Rome at a disadvantage increase all the time.  Rome is almost certain to come for you and it might be best to strike them first unless you can come up with a really good deal with them.

The cards provide a great variety of events and no power is ever safe from the tides of dad fortune that tend to sweep over the board at regular intervals.

It's definitely a game that more people should get around to playing, and if anyone is put off by the length, my advice would be - do the shorter scenarios F2F first and then hit the longer ones on ACTS.

This is the game I have been looking for for a long, long, time...

The theme is strong and there are many profound options.  This is not a complicated game, nor a simulation.  It truly is a "game," set within a (for me) highly engrossing period.  The rules are fairly easy to grasp, and usually intuitive.  Outstanding and highly recommended.

RATING: 7
Suffered the typical newbie issues the first time playing this - misplayed rules, misplayed positions, and misplayed my opponents (and played the wrong scenario!)  Nonetheless, its a beautifully complex game that I'm eager to play again - and especially as a 2-player game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based upon one advanced 4-player game. Gameplay is obscure for the first impression. There are so much things to observer (number of towns, provices, cities, civ-points, income, treasure, HI units) and only one small track is there for dozens of counters.
Rated up after an additional advanced game. "Advanced" means a game with less influence and more unexpected events - if the bad luck is withg you, you can be hit very hard from babarions, slaved and rebellions coming from nothing. Next i'll try the standard game.

11/16/13 Update:  Looking forward to the reprint.

I'm a sucker for historical games.  I'm just getting into this now, but love what I see.  This is a Civilization game first and wargame last.  You score points buy building towns and cities and controling provinces.  This is similar to Hannibal in that it is momentum based game, once you've got momentum on your side it's a good thing.  The other players need to counterbalance this by keeping the leader from running away with the game.

One of the things that I enjoy most about this game is the table talk as different players jockey for position and react to events.

The biggest downside of this game is that I feel that it plays best with four because the diplomacy / uncertainty aspects of this game are what makes it what it is, and the 4 player scenarios are longer.  With my gaming groups, and currently life, I don't see playing four player face to face very often.  As a result of this game, I'm learning about playing online and am playing my first game via Vassal (PBEM).  Learning about the game the same time you're learning how to use Vassal and ACTS is very daunting, and took much more time than I had imagined.  However the positive side of this is that I can spend time looking at each players move and run to the rulebook without holding anybody else up.

I've already spent hours soloing this game to get a feel for the rules.  Unless some serious play-balance issues emerge I feel this game could become a classic up there with Civilization and Diplomacy (well maybe not Diplomacy!)

Update:
Played the first 3 turns of an Advanced 4 player game (about 8 hours of play).  I think for us the thing that makes it great is the chaotic nature of events.  Greece may get control of one of The East's armies, Rome may Ally with the Pergamum and screw over Greece.  Carthage may put a Pirate on a critical Naval point to cut off Rome's lines of communication and therefore her income.  Make no mistake, Pax is great fun.  Remember fun fellow wargamers?!

Update:
I'm still playing this and still enjoying it.  Just when I was starting to think it was unbalanced someone points out a different strategy.  Lots here to like, just remember that Rome and Greece should ally initially or they could both be doomed!  Very well suited to PBEM play.

Update:  I *do* now believe there are balance issues.  These can be mitigated by diplomacy however.

Update: I've had to drop the rating down from "8" purely because I cannot get it on the table.  The only scenario which seems balanced and well play-tested takes 16+ hours to play, sadly.

Great game with a good rule- and gameplaybook. Fascinating but not less time consuming. If the player with seleukos gets the support in Asia minor then the greek player has a problem. The Roman player gets to enjoy this situation only for a short time because he is next. There are 2,3 and 4 player scenarios, but like in the most games only the big scenarios are the best. Strength and honor!

RATING: 8
It will take you a couple hours to read the rules but, suprisingly, the game itself is not overly complex. In fact,  I find War of the Ring more difficult. Regardless everything makes sense (well except Crete and Cyprus) and I'm enjoying my games. Leading your empire requires military might, strategic control of regions, as well as settlements to pay for everything. I like the unit differences, such as legions being slightly more powerful than a phalanx. I also enjoy the brutal unpredictability of battles, which are decided with a single dice roll by each side (with shifts and modifiers). This game satisfies my ancient wargaming needs! The two player are excellent, I've played the Punic War and had a great time. I have my map laminated and it looks beautiful.

Update:
After playing Pax Romana many times, with experienced players and rookies, I've definitely have developed some strong opinions of how best to play this game. Sometimes I can't help but feel I understand this game better than anyone I know. It was after all, one of the first games I ever purchased.

You can check out my suggested best way to play the game here:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/357569/belisarius-collection-of-optional-rules-and-varian

The one drawback to thinking so highly of myself in regards to this game is that I am loath to play it with different rule interpretations than mine. I feel like I am wasting time playing an earlier version of a game I've already moved on from. This becomes an issue when trying to play face to face.

Here are some early (May, 2006) impressions.  On the down side:

1) The board needs to be larger; was the size question not raised in the design or play-testing stages?  I am guessing the decision came down to, 1) money, and 2) what can we fit in the typical GMT box?  But C&C Ancients is not your typical GMT box, so why the limitation here?  The board is crowded, especially in a four-player game.  

2) Having but one "General Record Track" on this small board is a mess in the four-player making.  If there was only room for one chart, than why were there not play-aids included?  Even one that could be photo-copied would be helpful, given how many aspects need tracking. 

3) The selection of cards could have been better, particularly given the fine historical "mind(s)" that went into the game design.  To have more than one of the following, 

Revenues and Stability
Bounteous Harvest
Famine and Drought
Stability Check,

is a lame excuse for what was, and could have been, over this lengthy period of history.  And the "Day of Wrath" card is just plain silly, given that the gods can be molified for a mere two talents.  Why, why, why?  Especially given the historical brains behind the box.  Oh, Richard!  Why?  So much history is packed into this time period that there have to be more options than those presnted in the event deck.  Blah!

(June 2006) To the above cards I would add that players consider also limiting:

Slave Revolt
Rebellion
Barbarian Invasion
Tribal Resurgence
Alliance

Yes, I know each full turn represents 25 years, and a lot can happen, etc., but it practical game turns, I feel that there are too many opportunities for these things to happen to the same player.  A possible house rule idea: if you are already undergoing a rebellion, etc., put the card back into the deck and reshuffle it, and do not draw another card for that phase.

Then again, maybe I am just too darn picky; I have not found a card-driven or card--what's the correct word here?--"assisted" game that had a really decent set of cards.  

4) I found the examples of game play in the Playbook to be disappointing, but then these things always seem like artifical constructs to me.

5) I just cannot fathom the position of Greece in this game  The optional rule does not really seem to reflect the historical divisions.  I think a separate, and strong, Macedonia is necessary.  New units, new colour, new expense, I know.  This just does not seem like the Roman challenger of "The Conquerors."  If Rome wants to just shore-up Rome with decent strength, between it and The East, Greece may just become the nut between the proverbial nut-cracker.  Where's Philip V when you need him?

(June 2006)
I find that the Sucessor Wars Roll On card can fatally hurt the Greek player if he/she is already in dire straights.  I do not feel that it is "right" for a player to be virtually knocked out of the game because of one card.  There should be a house rule modification to deal with the possibilities.

Enough moaning--for now--let's look at the up-side:

1) A rulebook that is, on the whole, generally clear.  The examples are helpful.  It is neither too long nor too complex (for my tastes).  

Now for an aside, while I quote from the always interesting Chris Farrell:

"Just got my copy. Not sure what I was expecting; in retrospect, the P500 write-up page does some creative hand-waving on crucial details. It's another game with 30+ pages of rules and 6+ hour playing time. Even the version described as "fast play" appears to be complicated and 4+ hours. Which, to me, is not fast play, even by wargame standards. This is RHB, after all, so perhaps I have only myself to blame there."  And this, "It's still got too many rules, though."

Yes, Chris, you only have yourself to blame!  :)  This "is" Richard H. Berg in all his hoary glory.  You, who have played more games than I could ever imagine, how can this have too many rules?!  

Those gamers who complain about the length of rules in this game, well I cannot do any better than to quote RHB himself:

"As for, as someone above said, the claim that the game has too many rules, that's like the straight line from The King (what, Frederick II?. III?) in"Amadeus" about a Mozart opera. "Too many notes". PAX has all the rules it needs to present to the players the skeleton upon which they will hang the muscle of their decisions. There is far less fat on PAX than there is on most of those who will be playing it . . . or designign it, for that matter." 

2) A neat, nip-and-tuck, ebb-and-flow, system of game dynamics.  Yes, I am being very general, but one, you either have to wait for a real review, or two, you have to play it a while to experience that of which I speak.  

Another digression:

Charles, I don't care if you give it a "4;" that is your well-entitled opinion.  But I am very curious about these remarks:

"An odd mixture of generic empire building game and historical simulation. I'm not sure that it will tell you why Rome got to be Rome. It is full of decision points, but they do not always seem to be historical decision points."

Given that fact that ole Rome wasn't built in that proverbial day, pray tell, please explain what you mean in greater detail.  Was Rome "destined" to be Rome?  Or did Rome become Rome based on luck of the good, dumb, and bad (for the other guys) variety, along with hard-fighting, hard-thinking, and hard-drinking?

And Charles, realy, when you write this,
" Ty Bomba seldom produces a bad game," the depth of sarcastic replies is almost limitless.  :)

As for this comment from a Geek who is sure to know more about Roman history than your average Joe-Canadian:

"If you look for some historical insight, go somewhere else, this is a generic empire building strategy game with "some" historical flovour thrown in,"

perhaps it is best left in the hands of those who are both, one, Roman historians of note, and two, experts in these kinds of historical simulations.  Since I fail on both counts, I can only offer an opinion must humble.  Yet, I feel that I have learned a thing of two about how things might have been, and how they might have been different.  To each his own.

3) Combat resolution is simple, with the frequent possibility that loses may be applied to both sides.  Given that the defender, as well as the attacker, roll a die, smaller forces may hold-off, or possibly defeat larger forces.

4) The structure of "operations" means you cannot do everything at once; you are limited to one "major" move and two "minor" moves; planning and forsight are essential.  It is an elegant way to simplify and portray limited resources and strategic choices.

---------------

After giving it a go for a couple of weeks, it strikes me as a grander, more expansive version of Swords of Rome; this is not a favourable comparison.  It is an empire-building game with a strong dose of historical flavour, but flavour is all it is.  Sigh.  It's time to go back to Rise of the Roman Republic--bring on the 2nd Punic War.

Why still give it a "10?"  Because I like it.  It is playable, enjoyable and historical.  It is not the "perfect" game on the Roman Empire; that game has yet to be made. 

Some further comment on the:

RULES

1) Remember, you can only control a space, other than a home space, by have some kind of land-force in that space.  A naval or a commander by itself will not cut it.  

2) Read 12.1 on Garrisons with care.  There is a "strict" sequence to when you can build/move garrisons, which, if followed, has a significant impact on how quickly a player can gobble up empty spaces.

3) Naval movement through transit points is another picky rule; if you are moving an army, you could find yourself stuck, or worse, sunk because of the tp's.

4) I was slow to get wrap my head around the combat rules and the CRT.  I think this was not because it is complicated, but because I was expecting it to be complicated.  It is much simplier than ROR, which is neither a compliment or a criticism, just a factual statement.  Make sure your friends grasp it.  Duh!  :)

5) I have not downloaded the living rules, other than the revised victory conditions--15.0, I believe it is--so, make sure you know those.  It is possible to knock one side out of the game, though I had to be "intuitive" in order to figure this out.  Perhaps the living rules have made this clear.

6) Be a good boy or girl and photo-copy those charts.

7) Watch for the unit limitations and costs, as they are not the same for each side.  

8) Unit reduction, step reduction--it seemed to me that they went out of their way to muddy the waters, so have a clear understanding of this or you will either be losing too little or too much after combat.

Q: Why rate a game a "10" after listing all of this?  A: How many games are "perfect"?

I thought it might be helpful to gamers dropping in here to know that PAX was NEVER intended to be a historical simulation (in the sense that, say, RISE OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC is/was). I wanted to do what folks call a "Civilization-type" game that had a nice layer of historical flavor, enough history to give the  game some resonance, and a large dollop of the type of decisions (not all the decisions, to be sure) that faced the major powers of the day.

However, the main focus - and you folks know how  I feel about a game's Focus - is that PAX be a game that presents the players with a constant flow of difficult - and fun - decisions and challenges. To that extent PAX mirrors the development of The  Med generally, and generically . . . I doubt whether any game of PAX that covers more than 2,3 turns will provide any true, rigid sense of historicity. It will, however, provide a  great deal of "aura". And, if one can draw from the comments, above, a fair amount of Fun. 

As for, as someone above said, the claim that the game has "too many rules", that's like the  straight line from The King (what, Frederick II?. III?) in"Amadeus" about a Mozart opera. "Too many notes". PAX has all the rules it needs to present to the players the skeleton upon which they will hang the muscle of their decisions. There is far less fat on PAX than there is on most of those who will be  playing it . . . or designign it, for that matter.

Pax vobiscum, folks . . .

played it my first time today and like it very much. Much rules but logical and easy to learn.The current living rules had no holes. Battles include different unit types like elephants, cavalry and legion and go very fast. 

Some events seem very strong but they give a good historical feeling. In our game the romans had several towns in southern gaul but didnÂ´t protected them. The randomly arriving gaul horde destroyed 3 towns, punching Rome complete out of Gaul and destroyed a major income source. Hard for my game partner but gives a good feel of what can happen if you doesnÂ´t protect your endangered border territories and donÂ´t want effort enough to conquer complete Gaul. Vercingetorix won!

My favorite strategic game.  I played Greece and came in second to Rome.  Was a hard battle but the deciding factor was Carthage that decided not to attack Rome and tried to attack me.  He basically underestimated my strength.  This game is very tense and engaging.  The only negative to this game is down time between turns.  Other than that its a solid game that is cut throat.  You have to capitalize on the weaknesses of your opponents or your going to die quickly.

I've only played through about half of the first scenario, but I like it really well so far.  It can only improve as we move into the later scenarios.

I really, really like this game.  I have played scenario I twice and just started scenario II.  The options are endless and you get a lot of interesting scenarios too.

The game just keeps getting better.  Could reach a 10 eventually if it keeps being so much fun.

I've been reading through the rules for this one, with some desire to give it a play-through.

About 20 pages in, though, I just lost steam. So ... many ... rules. And not just a lot of rules, but lots of little moving parts you have to keep straight. Are we sure this couldn't have been just a little bit simpler? Or at least the rulebook more compactly presented? Trying to figure everything out here is a huge chore. Anything where you really want to have 4 players really needs to be more accessible than this, I think.

I'd still like to play sometime, but wow, it's a lot of rules.

Just got my copy. Not sure what I was expecting; in retrospect, the P500 write-up page does some creative hand-waving on crucial details.

Which, to me, is not fast play, even by wargame standards. This is RHB, after all, so perhaps I have only myself to blame there.

Bottom line, though, is that I'm a sucker for Ancients, and I do appreciate the range of scenarios supplied, from the 2-player Punic wars through 4-player Empire Buildathons. Like many empire-building games and many RHB games, I'm not sure it has great promise for actual repeated play, but it'll almost certainly be fun to contemplate, and probably to play a couple times. And who knows, maybe it'll really grab me. As an eclectic gamer, recent RHB efforts like Carthage have been more appealing than some of the stuff he did in the 90s/early 00s. Of course, Nero really sucked.

It's still got too many rules, though.

[12/12/2007] After a having played a couple of turns of Pax Romana, I have to say I'm not particularly enthused. This rather generic empire-building game seems to be just too fiddly and long for what it has to offer, as far as I'm concerned.

The combat system is rather interesting, but involves too much math and fiddliness for my tastes. Also, I found the link between naval and land warfare not as strong as it ought to be. For instance, unlike in Here I Stand, your own fleets do not help you hold a besieged city. I find this in terms of simulation and gameply value disappointing.

Great strategy game. Plenty of decisions to make and events to respond to with lots of flowing moves. On the other hand, moves can be hurt by die rolls and event cards, and some rules (i.e., amphibious attacks), and exceptions, need to be simplified or removed. Not very historical but who cares, it's still a great 4 player game. Excellent for PBEM, but long. If it didn't take so long to play it would be a 10, plus no one else wants to play it.

This game feels a lot like Richard Berg trying to imitate Mark Simonitch with a dash of Martin Wallace, but it just doesn't quite work. Instead of a seamless blending of styles, some sharp edges reach up and cut you from time to time. It feels like a strategic level game trying to be an operational level game.

It's not a terrible game. The mechanics are basically sound, and the stability track is a nice touch. With the right group of dedicated gamers it's probably fun for a play or three.

At the end of the day, though, the game is seriously overchromed and it's just not that interesting.

It feels more like an experience than a game. It's an ok ride but don't expect to able to control where you're going. It's fiddly, unbalanced and doesn't give you a feeling of the history it is supposed to portray at all. 

Honestly, I'm probably too kind with this rating, but the game seemed so interesting at first that I can't give it a lower rating just now.

Update. Sold it. No regrets.

You either cheat the history to make it play (The East) or condemn the Seleucids and Ptolomids to also-ran status. Wanted to love it but only like it (and in small doses). For the learning curve, I'd rather play Ancient World series.

Edit: I have no problem with the activation or combat/shift rules, but the naval/amphib rules are FIDDLY. I don't care what the game's supporters say.

Thought scale and similar topics to this game (plus few scenarios) would make it a bust; more downtime than you would think.  Biggest problem is historical: huge disparities in starting positions of the powers.  And 25 years or so per turn is an awful lot of time.

Very fun system, but someone needs to design a 4 or 5 turn campaign game for 4 players.  A 10 turn game must last three days!  I do not think it is possible for Rome or the East to win the campaign game as it stands.

Fascinating mechanics conflict with completely random game play. Some of the 2-player scenarios might work, but once the (awful) event cards come in, this is uncontrollable to such an extent it will most certainly annoy you. As a historic simulation it has some merit, but don't expect it to be the great strategic game it looks to be.

RATING: 4
I think my problem with this game is that it tries to be both a wargame and a civ game and it doesn't quite deliver on both. No real hard decisions to make about building towns and cities, even in mountainous areas. As long as you have A and B, hey presto, a city appears. Not like Civilization which attempts to show in a very effective way why cities were historically built in certain areas. Combat rules sound simple but are fiddly. The interception rules were incredibly chromey to simulate ... what, exactly? 

And that's the nub - chromey bits do not deliver on realism but certain thematic aspects are simplified to the point of blandness. Thus, my criticism of a 40+ page rulebook is not that it is long but it is long for the wrong reasons. 

Overall, the pacing for this game is slow. Things take a long time to develop. Lots of things, like through the random events, can happen in a turn but most are incremental and overall don't really have an impact. Or they have a devastating impact and completely derails a player. There's no happy middle ground.

RATING: N/A
Mix of eurogame and wargame (although more the latter) - I've now tried the shorter two player game.  One of my most memorable game sessions ever was a turn of Pax Romana where I did not even see the board, but teamed up with my buddy for an amazing come-from-behind win (to be honest, I just did some cheering and counselling).  See the session report here: "[url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/347903]Rewriting History: the intense and hilarious drama of my best ever game that I didn't even play[/url]"  The rules are too complex for my tastes and the game has too much emphasis on military combat for my liking, but I can appreciate the civ aspects that it offers, and it's undoubtedly a good game for the genre.

A must have for ancient war lovers. The East, Carthage, Greece, Egypt, and of course Rome fight it out to see who's the supreme power. The more provinces a player conquers the more talents he gets, which is used for buying light or heavy infantry, cavalry, galleys, elephants, garrison units, and militia. Buy towns and/or city walls to make your city stronger and harder to capture, in addition to increasing your earnings.  Up to four players can play and the game is also great solitiare.  Another GMT classic.

Beautiful map-board and counters. But the thick rule book and apparent fiddliness to the game will frighten off too many, particularly due to the naval rules. If this game's rules had a streamlined option, making it easier for most to learn, it would be a fantastic (and probably best) game concerning the ancient conflicts around the Mediterranean. I'm still holding onto my copy  for now.

RATING: 8
Just finished marathon 4 player solo game of Pax Romana, took about 12 hours to get through 6 turns of the grand scenario (IV) with the historical setup of separate Seleucid and Ptolemaic player. (includes reading the rules and punching/setting up counters)

It was a gigantic struggle with the Carthaginians taking the early lead invading Hispania and by turn 3 was able to subdue the Iberian Peninsular for lots of GOP points and a decent income. 

The Romans had a very slow start and remained in contention by staying low (since they had NO victory points till turn 4, it was certainly working) and out of everybody's way eventually making an excursion to conquer the Danube soon after Turn 3 with the power of integrated cavalry in their legion units (this is when the Roman Legions come into their own), their initial slow start and low income will soon come to haunt them as they couldn't later muster the huge Roman Legions needed to face of Rome's many enemies.

Then we come to the Greeks, the poor Greeks, starting the game on two fronts with a tenuous foothold in Bruttrium (pun intended) and an equally unsteady foothold in western Anatolia with the Seleucid with no where to go but west. The Greeks' seemingly good starting resources just wasn't enough to survive being between the hammer and the anvil. Knowing this likely outcome, the Greeks took a defensive strategy, concentrating forces in the east before the Romans have the strength to mount a strong offensive in the west... felt like Germany all over again. It didn't work. 

The Seleucid player starts in a very strong position with their sedate NPC Ptolemaic buffering Carthage, they were able to concentrate their relative stronger income to create forces to invade Anatolia. Not only did they succeed, they laid the ground work to victory being able to build a ton of towns in Eastern Anatolia with their spare cash and of course this snowballed to even more cash...

By Turn 6 (of a potential 10 Turn game), with the play of an Alliance card by the Romans, it was decided an UNHOLY and totally unhistorical alliance between Rome and Carthage (where just the turn before, the two were at each other's throats in Sicily) Both sides allowed the other's units to past through their territories unmolested. Hoping with one less front to worry about, they could contain the Seleucid Juggernaut. 

By the end of turn 5, the Greeks were almost gone with just a few tough units holed up in Pella, Athens falling to the Seleucids in Turn 5. More importantly with the control of the Aegean Sea, the Seleucid player amassed another 5 VP every turn as it is one of their victory objectives. 

Similarly the Carthaginians controlled the Tyrrhenian Sea for some bonus GOP points but getting actually Victory Points is A LOT better. By the end of the Turn 6, the Seleucid player's score had caught up with the Carthaginians and looks to rush past in the next couple of turns.

Turn 6 saw the Carthaginians invade Egypt to open a Southern Flank into Syria, they barely scraped through taking Alexandria only with the lucky draw of the Soldier of Fortune Card, with the help of the mercenaries they were able to take control of all the Ptolemaic player's lands but at a very high cost, with only a very weaken force holding Egypt and with the Soldier of Fortune Mercs gone at the beginning of next turn, all the Carthaginians have managed to do is make it easier for the Seleucid player to spawn reinforcements in Syria to take Egypt the next turn. 

During turn 6, the Seleucid player concentrated up north, exchanging territories with Rome. The tactic here being to stress Rome's stability to Unrest which will ensure Rome not having enough might in later turns to make a come back. And with Rome's poor finances it is doubtful they could make a come back with the whole empire on the verge of unrest. 

So it was, that the other players surrender to the might of the East.

Great game with sweeping narratives during play, especially at this scale (25 year turns). It's like seeing history unfold before you. The game's rules are fairly clear, with the current living rules clearing up some questions I had. The system and the geography does an amazing job of emulating history. After the game you see why the Greeks were in decline and understand the meteoric rise of the Roman empire (even though they lost in my game). 

At first I thought the Seleucid player would be in trouble without control of the Ptolemic areas but it turned out to be a boon and being able to concentrate forces in the North, practically ignoring the South, I kept a few units in Judea for the occasional Ptolemaic incursions which never amounted to much. 

What I found most unique about the game is the empire building feel to it, it was clear that the Seleucid won because of good colonizing skills to lay the ground work for future turns and not just war. The hidden objectives and various victory objective also lend flavor to the empire nature of the game. 

Are there any negatives? Not too much, I didn't use the Galley Fleets much, they certainly made attacking via the sea a big NO NO in some situations, but those situations were few and far between since there seems to be lots of land approaches to most places. The cost of the fleets also made me think twice about having too many around, but maybe you could build a strategy around naval power, but I am not seeing it. 

The other thing is the war elephants... they were practically useless since you can retreat prior to combat to fight in towns and cities or mountains where war elephants can't be used, (or cavalry for that matter), they made war elephants useful very very rarely. Probably historical though. As the game progresses and more towns and cities pop up the less and less useful are the elephants and even the cavalry. The latter only useful when you are out in the open and NOT fighting the Romans whom has built-in cavalry that will surely outnumber yours.

These are small nit picks of what is a wonderful game. I like how cities are handled much more than Imperium Romanum: The Clash of Legions, but more fiddly.

Well this IMO is over-complicated. The ratio between sheer size of rules (2 books and 8 pages of tables) and playing fun (which is considerable) is yet too big. And the physical side of things: hundreds of (small and fiddly) counters, bad methods of bookkeeping and a big map on ordinary paper. I am an old wargamer and holds nothing against a complicated game, but things have happened the last 10 years, haven't they? So my initial 8 (for a good game) gets -1 for appearance and -1 for all-too-long rules boils down to a 6.

RATING: 8
It's a brain burning game. There are lots of choices, lots of interesting twists and turns. There can also be diplomacy which can get quite involved. 

The game covers an interesting period of ancient history. The game conveys a strong sense of that period.  

RULES
The rules are long (over 40 pages) and then there is the playbook running at just over 30 pages. The rules are well written and thus easy to absorb. That said there were a few occasions in the game where I missed / misunderstood a rule and was duly punished. The rules are designed to bring depth and some historical faithfulness to the game which I think they succeed in doing. 

DURATION
I have played this just once. I played it over the internet using ACTs / cyberboard. Cyberboard is an impressive system but it does test one's patience. Pax Romana is a long game and playing it on cyberboard dragged it out a bit longer. Our game took about 5 months and many hours to play. That said the game was quite engrossing. 

FACTIONS
The Factions each have their own historical characteristics and position on the board. The Roman's have strong legions. However, Rome starts the game comparatively weak. Carthage and East have elephants. Greece and Carthage have strong fleets at the start. The Greeks have a shortage of cavalry and not much cavalry building opportunities. Rome and Greece are the most vulnerable to barbarian invasions. 

Diplomacy can be used to prevent a faction from gaining too much of an advantage. It probably pays for Greece and Carthage to make sure that Rome does not with fulfill its superpower potential.    

East represents Egypt and the Seleucid Empire. These two empires fought each other. Each turn there is a 1 in 6 chance that the Greek player will get to use an East army to attack the East. East's self harming tendency can be very troublesome and annoying for the East player.

Pax has been unfairly described as a 2 x 2 player game with Rome fighting Carthage and East fighting Greece. There is a strong tendency for hostilities to develop along those lines there can still be a lot of other player interaction.      

RANDOM EVENTS
There is a lot of randomness in the game. Some die rolls and some events at critical points in the game can have a significant impact. Multiple players add more uncertainty. Other people can surprise you with the things they do. Consequently you can feel to some extent like a hostage to fortune if events and other players don't do the unexpected. That said I quite like a bit of randomness. It can produce some surprising twists and turns which can be more fun than simply watching the best player grind out a victory. 

The uncertainties in the game can make it tense and compelling. It means that although you may draw up plans and ponder various scenarios and options, you never really know what is going to happen next - there are so many possibilities. You have to be adaptable. 

The randomness also makes each game different, thus adding to the replay value.

DRAWBACK
The 4 factions never get entirely knocked out. Your faction can be crushed leaving you in a 'zombie like' position were you can no longer really compete and can't do much, but still have to play on. It would be particularly tough on a player if this happened early in the game.  

DIPLOMACY
The game is one in which the player doing well will continue to do well, unless the others get together to stop him. Similarly, when you're down, the game kicks you. Diplomacy is the best way to stop players running away with the game. It also provides the best hope for players who are struggling.

RATING: 9.1
Something for us decaying Empire in Arms players to play :-) Thumbs up. Heavier than NAP Wars. Playable. Lots of fun. Random events and the luck of the activation of leader order SIGNIFICANTLY impact the game. No EiA here, But, what is EiA or WiF but EiA and WiF?

2 LONG (all day) sessions to do the campaign game.  Experienced gamers will take about 1 1/2 hours to do a complete game turn (which will generally have 16 activations - 4 players with 4 activation each. Activations can come out in any order, so, strap on to the luck roller coaster :-)

Recommend bidding VPs to play side to play balance Scenario V - 4 Player. That particular scenario should be called Punk Romana because Rome can be stopped in its tracks before it ever gets going. Sadly, this would mean no HBO Rome series. This is true with all the powers (except Carthage); they can be TOTALLY stuffed turn 1 or turn 2. So, you'll need to modify that in couple of ways: gentlemen's agreement to not totally gut another player early, low VPs gets to pick were it moves and other house tweaks as needed (have posted our current house rules).

Other likes/dislikes:

1) The campaigning/moving/dancing. Mr.Berg has come up with a very good/relatively clean/fun system for marching & fighting. Feels right. He nailed the sea/land integration. Hats off to the designer.

2) Supply rules don't really come into play. Where's the forage values? Don't exist. How about some attrition for concentrations of troops? Doesn't exist. Generally, logistical considerations can be ignored. Grumble, grumble. Don't like the lack of supply & logistical considerations.

3) The event cards. About a 1/3 have any impact. The rest are noise. The effect is that one player usually is hit hard each turn, regardless of their strategy. Don't like that either, but, this is an "experience" game: you are long for the ride.

4) Combat. Like it. Clean and brutal. Wish their would have been some chits also. But, really dig the combat system.

5) Economics. Works well. Like it.

6) Political Stability sub-system. Doesn't work. Nope. We've softened on our original critical view of it...somewhat. Will give it yet another chance.

See my session reports on the 3P and 4P scenarios. 

I would HIGHLY recommend wargamers get a copy of PAX. It won't completely fill the EiA ache/itch, but, no multiplayer wargame in the last 30 years does. Can anyone produce a meaty, historical, fun multiplayer wargame anymore? My crew will give Clash of Monarchs soon....when we tire of PAX...which may be awhile. 

PAX is a real blast!

One of the things that really draws me to pax is that the players really have difficult decisions to make. You have to decide where to attack, what to build and who to trust. The beauty of the game is how necessary war is, but how bad it is as well. An interesting Asymetric game, I love it :).

I like the game, I have played the first 3 senarios:
- The Pyrrhic War (introduction really)
- The Punic War (unbalanced hard to have something else then draw)
- Selecus in Asia Minor (unbalanced hard to have something else then draw)

I beleive they are all introduction senario, and I like it, this kind of game need to have lot of small senario to learn rules.

Now I am getting prepared for 
Carthago Delenda Est or The Rise Of Rome

This game is realy interresting

incomme :(geographic + town/city) add strategy when planning conquest
fleet : (nice system for fleet movement combat etc.)
production : (related to country) Elephant can only be trainned in Africa, etc.

combat system is not bad at all 


The not so good aspect of the game for me is lots of random factor, fleet moving, combat resolution.

I want to like Pax more than I do.  I love the theme and era.  I love a great deal of what the design is trying to accomplish, but in the end, the game suffers from a cumbersome fiddly rule-set.  Massive quantities of disasters, 'take that' events, and general chaos detract from any long term planning imo.  The combat system is fiddly, complicated, and hard to grasp at first.  Naval movment is like studying for the bar.  

More plays only resulted in more frustration.  Me no likey.

Update: I cracked. The second edition is on pre-order. CScott got my interest up at Geek con 2007 when he asked if I'd ever picked it up and then mentioned that it was almost his favorite game at the moment. I know it's damn long, but I couldn't get past the Rome kick. Count me as a goner when Rise of the Republic comes out as well.

Original thoughts: 
I'm on a huge Rome kick at the moment, this looks good, but can I get it to the table or stoke up interest...does it play good with 2?

I fully admit that Chris Farell's comments have given me a moment of pause. I was expecting less in the rules area...still intrigued, but well, I've been given pause. I'll read the online rules if I get a chance.

It's so damn appealing...will I be able to get it to the table...if it is good solo I can always play it so that's a plus, but it's always better to have players across the table...must investigate more and would love to try it if possible.

Rome is not built in one day...The combat system is another new one from Richard Berg, where ratio of battle points between the attacker and defender is the no. of "shifts" to the combat dieroll, result of which can turn to inflict more on the other side or reducing own troop's percentage of units loss.  

Activation based, the game utilize event markers in the basic game and event cards in the advanced game. Prepare to bring along other games' counters as the countermix doesn't mean there is a "limit" on the size of anything. 

There are an extensive naval operations rules and the use of effective naval transport and amphibious attacks are crucial to a player from having more flexible strategic options.  Types of troops also play important role in the combat, e.g. calvary superiority and supermacy (yes they are 2 types), elephants and galley (in case the battle is fought in a port).  

Leader is subjec to death roll after a battle.  Leader has both tactical (for combat) and campaign rating (for movement and interception).  Each side has 10 leaders and they are randomnly selected every game turn, akin to the Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage system of the Roman consulates.

6 games played. Currently my favorite grand strategy game. Brilliant mix between strategy (your goal) and tactics (how you achieve it). Some unnecessary complexity, but once you learn how to play (which isn't hard with the excellent tutorial and "Quick Start" rules), it actually becomes very intuitive. Very good solo play, and will receive excellent support. Enough depth here to play for years (a sequel is already in the planning stages).

Interesting war/empire building game.  This game nails it for me with respect to a fast war/civ lite game.  Love the battle mechanic and the random activations.  The cards add some interesting problems and opportunities.  A lot of bad can happen that seems 'random' but one has to remember the time scale.  One must manage their civilization over time.  The Slave Revolt Card is, perhaps, one of the most powerful cards in the game.  The game flows very well once you are up and started.

I playtested Pax Romana and I am very happy with how the game came out.  I think it is one of the best multiplayer wargames I have ever played.  Here is why:  1.  Each power has absolute control over their destiny, provided their plan and their diplomacy is up to the task.  2.  Though there are very few specialized rules, each power you play seems very different and you face different conflicts.  3.  There are many different strategies you can adopt.  You can choose to be a warrior, a planner, an economist, a colonizer, or (normally) a mix of all these roles.4.  Though it is important to know how to fight, it is unlikely that war will decide the game.  You can lose many battles and still do very well if you have good diplomacy and a good plan. We play with two small changes.   First, we adopt the "talk the talk" rule, where diplomacy is free-wheeling.  Second, we pay for all activations at the beginning of a turn, so nobody has to pass.  This is because we are notoriously bad at budgeting. I really enjoy the game.  The combat system is extraordinary and the strategic situation is just sensational.  This is a GREAT game, in the full sense of the word.Anyone interested in PBEM?  I will be moderating games during the summer.

My only issues with the game at this juncture:  I hate the tracks.  I don't like the money - I use Poker Chips.  That's about it.

Basically Genesis on steroids.  There's a lot going on here and a four player game is going to take multiple sessions.

If you've played Genesis, Successors, Sword of Rome, etc., then you'll definitely want to add this to your collection.

RATING: 3
Both extremely fiddly and random, which annoys me to no end. I read a remark somewhere that said this is more of a simulation than a wargame, and I'm inclined to agree- you spend as much, if not more time reacting to random destructive events than engaging your opponents. I like the activation model, and the battle mechanic is actually quite cool and opens up some interesting choices , but there are endless rules and charts to constantly deal with. This *could* have been a great game, but is just not fun. A better title for this game would be "Richard Berg's Series of Unfortunate Events".

Incredibly fun. Played two full, four player, advanced game, scenario VI, 20-25 hour marathons - back to back over 10 weekly sessions.

RATING: 8
Epic game of military conflict in the Ancient Roman world. Quite heavy rules, but once it clicks they're not too difficult. Loads of historical 'chrome' gives this a real feel of the Empires in conflict. The battles are simple and can give unexpected results (smaller forces defeating larger, sieges, Phyrric victories etc). It can be very long and does require a lot of attention to get the most out of it - not a game for the casual gamer, but if you're interested in the grand sweep of Roman history its a must.

Played this a few times, a couple of scenarios and the big campaign twice.  I thought the scenarios were OK, but nothing special.  I didn't get a great feel for the period playing them.

The big campaign takes a loooong time to play, which I'm not against per se-- I like long games-- but I just felt it didn't provide enough "bang for the buck" for the amount of time it took to play. That being said, we didn't play with the cards, which could add some more flavor to the game (at the expense of even more playing time from what I've heard).

I guess for me the verdict is still out on this one. I love ancients so I'd be willing to give it another shot, but it's not at the top of my list.

Update 2: Acquired the 2nd edition and played Scenario VII. I like it, though it may be difficult to get on the table. Lots of chrome, still, with little streamlining.

Update: I respect Pax, and if it was lighter and a more friendly system I'd definitely get it on the table.  As it is now, I can't imagine doing so.  Up For Trade.

Even though this is dead on target in my era of interest (the Ancient world and the rise of Rome), the rulebook and my inexperience with earlier Berg designs gave me the willies.  I shouldn't have worried; after one Turn of trying different maneuvers, it's pretty simple to see what you can do (with a lot of help from Mgringo, of course!)  It's just got LOADS of options, and I don't feel constrained in the slightest.  Want to civ-build?  Go ahead!  Make war and not love?  Bring on the elephants!  It's a pretty deep game, and I'm still sifting through the layers.

All that said, though, I do feel in my present Pbem game that I'm the Seleucian red-headed step-child.  The other players are double me in VPs, so I must be doing something wrong, but we are all of us civ-building (well, not so much now) so I'm not sure what I'm missing.  There are also many particularities in the rules, and I just can't imagine playing the Advanced scenario ftf, much less GMing the thing.  However, I think that is my inexperience talking; I just bought Berg's Alexander Deluxe and I'm very curious to see what OCS is like.  And I don't mind feeling "under the gun" in games as long as I've got options, and I've got loads.

RATING: 6
This is a preliminary rating after around 15 hours of playing and with the Living Rules of June 2006. Nevertheless enough time to get a grasp of components, rules and mechanisms.

The game feels somewhat unfinished, possibly pushed to fast into production to get some late time changes integrated, e.g.: missing syracusian and egyptian fleets, clumsy manpower rules, unfit for 3-players (except you give the 4th power completely to one of the players, otherwise it is prone to abuse).
The rules are from wargamers for wargamers, the so called "standard rules" (there are also "advanced rules") are already more complex than that of many wargames, but the basic mechanisms (move, fight, build) are easy and sound. I think it would have been a better idea to have a basic game system and in addition tons of optional rules to allow the players to add as many complexity and historical chrome as they want (e.g. not everybody needs/wants a gallic rebellion that looks like Vercingetorix vs. Caesar). This would also have allowed a more open system where later different variants could have been developed - the topic and timeframe would allow and even justify a lot of different interpretations of possible what-ifs (would have a gallic uprising vs. a carthagian occupation in the 2nd century BC looked like Vercingetorix vs. Caesar?).

I bought this cheap as I was in the mood for another multi-player CDG, and was short of Ancient Med games. There are four powers (Carthage, Rome, Greece and Selecuid) who use resources to build towns and cities, which in turn produce more resources. They also build military units, cavalry, light troops, heavy infantry and warships, and randomly drawn leaders of varying quality each turn. These are stacked up into armies and fleets which can be used to defeat barbarians or fight the other players. The cards can be helpful, but are not essential or game-changers. In my only full game the Romans were hampered by the non-player invasion of Pyrrhus and thereafter were always in fourth place. Carthage won by spreading across Spain and Gaul, Greece took over the Balkans and invaded Italy and the Selecuids took the middle east.

Playing this game is an experience.  The art is absolutely beautiful, the game has twists and turns providing many interesting decisions and the concept of the game is exactly what I was looking for with its civ building  / war game / how the Med came to be.  Sure, it is not a simulation (why should it be?)... sure, it is chaotic...  sure, you can fall behind with no hope of recover...  sure, Greece can get totally screwed with card play...  This game is a blast.

RATING: 9
I love this game.  This is probably a 9, but it's gets a 10 from me as it such pure fun to play.  It encompasses a lot, empire building, diplomacy, warring, etc.  There are many approaches to take in how you play this, and it is important to pay attention to all aspects of your empire.  Your choose which units to build based on your objectives.  It do not play like a card driven game, but has event cards which are important and drastically affect the game play.  The cards add a large degree of unpredictability, as you can be prepared to go campaigning and teach that annoying Roman neighbor of yours a lesson, when all of a sudden barbarians come down screaming from the hills and you have to change your plans to deal with that situation.  There is a great Vassal module for this game (thanks Kevin).  The developer, Neil Randall, provides great, ever present, support for the game.  My only complaint is that the tracks for recording the various book keeping needed to be larger.  The game is not very complex, while not a means to study history does provide a great feel of the history, and most importantly is great rollicking fun!  Too often with wargames I think we forget this is supposed to be fun.  This game will provide that for you.

Just not enough bang for your buck when it comes to rules look-ups and playing time. I could maybe be talked into an online game with experience players and a dedicated admin, but I'm through with this as a face-to-face experience. Adjusting rating accordingly.

==================================================

Long. Lots of luck. Many conditional rules difficult to remember. Has built-in mechanisms where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.

Yet despite all that, Pax manages to be a tremendously engaging and fun game. The tactical maneuvering - with considerations for both land and naval approaches - is rich with possibilities without being overwhelming. Combat runs smoothly, but features some important decisions. Chock full of historical flavour. Gameplay produces enjoyable narrative.

Once you understand the system, the tense four-way diplomatic struggle becomes paramount. Interaction of board play, card events, and table talk generates a fantastic story for every game.

A rollicking history ride that fits the standard "rewards repeated plays" line... except you'll need a whole day to play the standard game so you'll have to wait until retirement to really get the best out of it. So, aside from the length on the game the game itself is reasonable fun. Once the most used rules have been committed to memory you can finally lay the rule book aside and see what you're doing, what you should have done and what you're going to do differently if the game ever makes it to the table again. I really like the combat system of percentage losses modified by basic step advantages - really, really like. The basics of the game with unknown turn order and a simple one major and two minor movements each activation is very simple and works well. My main criticism is that in a game with so many dice rules it really isn't necessary to have so many exceptions and tiny modifying rules - the game would just play so much faster and cleaner if a few aspects were simplified. It mightn't be as good a simulation, but it would definitely be an even better game. The game is interesting enough that it might just be worth commiting the whole damn thing to memory and buying a copy myself.

This game really hits a sweet spot for me. I love the historical empire building theme with military and civilization aspects as well as the need for economic planning and diplomacy. The limited actions per activation as well as the randomness in combat, movement, turn order, and events make for a very fun game. There are a lot of interesting decisions and yet it is not brain burning b/c of the fun and "realistic" randomness. Wonderful game that I look forward to exploring further in the years to come!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Here's the thing. Did I have a good time? Most assuredly, yes. How much of it was due to the game? A little hard to say. I think I like the basic system of city-building, campaigning, and the subtle unit differentiation. I like less the lack of political rules and the basic similarities between all the powers. The crazy random events I had heard much about turned out to not be that big a deal; but then again, I'm used to stuff like that anyway from Joe Miranda 101. So what's the problem here?

I think it might just be the situation. The East has only one serious strategic option, which is to subdue Asia Minor and use it as a springboard for world domination. Rome and Carthage have "rear" areas they can develop (Gaul and Hispania, respectively). Greece has the Balkans, but my feeling is that they would lose that footrace against the Romans if they went north. That means the Greeks often turn east against the Seleucids, and usually both powers suffer for it. Not to say that Rome and Carthage don't come to grips with each other (I suspect they usually do) but perhaps not until they've had a chance to fatten themselves a bit. The East just does not have that luxury.

Assuming this is a problem (and I am by no means convinced there is one) what is the solution? Expanding the map to the east to give The East more options is not such a great idea to my mind. I don't think you want to give everyone too much incentive to play in their own backyards and the expense of having to wait so long for direct conflict. TrÃ¨s Diplomacy, sirs. Perhaps the answer lies in cutting off some of the western side of the map, like parts of Spain and France.

In any case, the biggest valid complaint against Pax is that it takes a while to play. I can agree with that. It also suffers from being a multiplayer free-for-all wargame with all the "fun" that entails. I can't seriously take Pax to task for being what it was designed to be. In the end, I managed to have a good time while taking a seriously grave beating, and I guess you can't complain too much about that.

Rating based on going through the rules and play of Pyrrhic war scenario (which didn't even try to be interesting). Certainly on the fiddly (a lot of rules to remember, in a Bergian sort of way) range of the spectrum, but probably very much my cup of tea, if I'll ever get a chance to tackle the grand scenarios.

Did try the grand scenario, 4 players. Loved it though I was being thrashed.

RATING: 6
I really want to like this one, but it's just so long -- I don't see how the actual 10-turn game could ever be played when "short" 1-turn scenarios take ~5 hours. Granted, a lot can happen in 1-turn (such as Pyrrhus' entire campaign), but at that level you're not experiencing the empire-building aspect of the game. There are some good ideas such as the cavalry supremacy/superiority rules and effect on retreat. Also, the rulebook is surprisingly clear. But the game's got some supremely frustrating bits with naval movement at the top of the list. The map doesn't really excite me. Finally, I thought the event deck might spice things up, but you're mostly dreading what terrible thing will befall you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My initial rating of 9 was based on complete rules reading and solitaire play.  Now that I've had a chance to play it five times, it goes up to a 10!  This game is a blast!  More chaos than most wargames, but to my tastes, that's a big plus.  This is NOT a dry game.  Loads of fun, the best laid plans fall apart as a new event occurs, lots of strategies to try, but no one is guaranteed to win - I love it.

So far:
This is a complex game, and an interesting mix of wargame and civilization building. There is a strong civilization building element for three reasons:

1. You only get income from expanding your empire and building cities and towns. If the other players have too much more money than you, you'll lose painfully.
2. You get victory points for conquering provinces and territories and also for building cities and towns.
3. You are limited in how many heavy infantry/legions you can field by the number of cities and towns you control.

It's a long game, and that means most Eurogamers won't care for it. There are short scenarios, but they tend to focus on military matters more than civ building.

The rules are long, and as I say complex, but I've actually played wargames with more complexity. The rulebook is, largely, very clear and easy to understand - there are just a lot of rules which is why it takes a while to learn. The short scenarios are really for teaching the game, and they do a good job of it.

If you don't mind a long, complex game without trading, but with plenty of civilization building, warfare, possible alliances and backstabbing, and random events that throw monkey wrenches into everyone's plans, this in an excellent game.

Richard Berg has an enormous knowledge of the Ancient world, and if you pair him with a developer who knows how to create a playable game, the result will always be magnificent.
Pax Romana very well creates the historical flow of events on a grand strategical scale. Try the Punic War scenario for 2 players - it is marvelous.

RATING: 8
Tremendous enjoyment, both ftf and solo. Raise Legions (and other troop types), sail Galleys, subjugate Barbarian Tribes, construct Towns and Cities, manage your Treasury, conquer enemy Provinces, deal with random events, etc. This one has it all - military, political, and economic - in a very accessible and easy to play format (the rules are not as daunting as they appear).

There was a glitch where the wrong Victory Section file was printed, so be sure to check the download for the latest version. 

The flexibility of the scenarios is very well done. Note that I prefer the 2-player scenarios, and I'm not a big fan of using the cards.

PAX is immersive and compelling, setting the standard for the conquest/empire building genre - it is THE ancient world in a box.  

[update] The second edition should (hopefully) polish this to a gem. Unfortunately, with the mounted map and such the 2nd edition should have had a deep box as not even a single counter tray fits (and there are 5 sheets of counters).

Combat rules at first a bit strange but it's a big stretch of time and one 'fight' represents a whole campaign.

Needs four players for a sound game. Hopeless solitaire and not all that great two player. Worth owning for what it can teach you for your own game designs for the period.

This one is "my precious". Lots of rules, lot of chrome but a helluva lot of fun and overwhelming amount of decisions to be made. This one will fry your brain while being interesting and entertaining. All those needing gateway games and thinking about Agricola and Caylus as "complex" should reconsider their definition of complexity. In spite of their number the rules are clearly written and everything should be clear after a couple of plays. Some say it's chaotic but I like the constant pressure and the need to be prepared for everything.

One of my favorite games. The nature of the rules and decision-making, as well as the random elements, definitely doesn't make it a game for everyone. Neither is it particularly historical when you stop to consider some of the options. But no other game captures such a great feeling of competing ancient empires, their conflicts, their expansion and their rivalries.

Great map and wonderful detail, but too much of the latter to get onto the gaming table.  Traded away with best wishes.

Long, fun - a mix of empire building and campaigning. A bit too heavy on the building side, though, it could use more player interaction.

Interesting scenarios : II (for a one-session 2-players game), IV (for a longer one 2-player) and VI (the whole enchilada with 4 players and the optional rules)

Chances are that Pax Romana will have permanent place alongside Hannibal and Wilderness War as the best board games ever.

System is very nice indeed. Games can be long, but then again, for time constraints, the length can be adjusted easily by leaving out advanced details, or adding them accordingly.

Good game, especially the scope of time it covers. Lots of choices and options, great map and components. It's very simple in design but there is really just too many rules and there not explained very well in the first edition rulebook. The shear length of time the game takes to play to completion, especially the full campaign, almost makes it unplayable. I like the game, but this one will be taking up table space for weeks and as a result, will seldom hit the table.

My one play of this was not under the best conditions.  I hadn't read the rules ahead of time, it was a three player learning game, and there was a lot of referencing the rules for the game, especially how they were counteracted by the rules for the scenario.  Finally, due to a lack of understanding of the strategy in the early game, I completely got my first army quickly wiped out in a foolish invasion of Egypt.  But there's potential here.  I am interested in playing again.  But I don't think I'm going to seek it out.  I will make sure I read the rules beforehand so that I have a better grasp on what's going on.  I like the civ-building that the scope of this game allows.  It can be a viable strategy to outbuild your opponents, as well as out-militarize them.

One of RB okay games on the Ancient period. I have others I prefer now. Still it is a RB design and for me that is always a positive when looking to buy a game. You will not go far wrong getting this game.

Me gusta este juego pero tengo algún sentimiento contradictorio con él. Su principal problema es su gran duración y sobre todo el excesivo entreturno que pueden tener los jugadores. Eso si, solamente para jugarlo con cuatro personas.

I played two four player games of scenario V and we all agreed that the game is overwrought with procedures and exceptions and one time events that suck the life out of the game. The combat system is interesting and there are some good things going on in the game but the whole package just totally misses the mark.
Game is up for sale or trade.

Much too complicated and fiddly for my tastes. I could see how it might be more fun if my friends and I had the opportunity to play regularly and get somewhat familiar with the rules. If you're like me and only get to play big strategy games a few times a year, though, then I can't recommend this one.

The idea was great. I like the ancient period. But too much errata at first and not balanced (Rome is too weak at the beginning and Cartago is andvantaged for this). Of course I understand only some games after that there was a mistake on the map (the link between pisa and corsica was missed).

Nice design with this multi-player game, but the cards in the advanced game can be extremely random and cause huge swings in fortune.  The randomness of leader draws and movement/combat rolls can also lead to erratic games.  Down time between your turns can get pretty long.  The powers could be better balanced.

I love the concept.This game contains some very innovative idea of how ancient wars really were.On the other hand, development is very poor.  The rule is too long for the gameplay value.  Some mechanics doesn't work well and IMHO most of them should be deleted from the game and make the rule clear and short and also playtime short and comfortable.I usually don't become disliking the game because it has long rule (I love ASL.).  But, this rule is too long and doesn't meet the game value.

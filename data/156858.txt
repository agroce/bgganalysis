For me a perfect co-op. Mechanics are very straightforward, and easy to play. Plays well solitaire and multi-player, and recreates the tension and situation the plotters found themselves in. It is luck dependent, but then that reflects the situation the real situation.

There is randomness but it does not govern the game. Your moves around the board, your play of cards, what Actions to take, where and when to strike...all those are players decisions. Event cards provide changes in the board you need to react to. And even the Plot roll is not final if you miss, you might have another chance if you try harder...

The most important thing (besides that its fun to play) is that achieves the goal to build up tension in the players and make them feel like building up a conspiracy. Very thematic game. Great art and component design as well.  Really hope it gets done.

Provision Rating.

Love the theme. Love the idea of the game. Less enamored with the execution. 

Core mechanisms feel a bit simplistic, or convoluted (conspire action). All in all, the game has a very unique feel, but instead of having micro goals and accomplishments littered through the play experience (ala Pandemic), there is a singular goal all players are building up to. This can be anticlimactic if that perfect moment never arises.

New players also find it hard to prioritize a plan from the myriad possibilities given.

Black Orchestra is a cooperative game set in 1940's Germany, with the goal of assassinating Hitler.  You work together to build your motivation while avoiding increasing your suspicion, also being careful not to be arrested and interagated while collecting materials and finding plots that will ultimately lead to success.

Excellent Game!

I received my pre-ordered copy this week; and had a chance to play this three times over the weekend all 2-player experiences. I must say WOW! There are many things we liked about the game.

First, the artwork and graphic design is excellent. The board and rules are expertly laid out (IMHO). We never felt like we had to hunt for a rule, a symbol, location, etc. The cards are a wonderful blend of art and text, with just enough of both and never too much of either.

Second, the event decks really create a story for the game – from early war until the end. We felt it was very cinematic. They created realistic movements for Hitler and his deputies. The raids (or just the dread of potential raids) kept the tension throughout. In each of our three games we were able to ramp-up our motivation early only to find we didn’t have the right plots or items to successfully attempt the assassination. But then after scheming (collecting good plot cards) and collecting the right items we found either our suspicion levels too high or that our motivation was waning.

Next, this game is difficult (the mark of a good co-op or us), even starting with Military Support at the easy level. We have three plays under our belt. In each game, we could only put together 3 to 4 assassination attempts. We haven’t won yet. It could be we stink at this game, but we’ve really enjoyed the experience.

Finally, there is enough luck for our tastes to create tension and excitement. Yes, die rolls and card draws can screw you in this game. If you don’t like that then stay away. We however really loved it.

I know the theme of this game may be a turn off for some; but I think it would be no more “distasteful” than any other WW2 themed game.

I’m curious to hear what others have to say about this one. I really haven’t been this impressed with a game in a long time!

I feel there's too little control and too much chance. I can't say the feeling of hopelessness keeps me wanting more. To be able to scrape up five individual attempts at assassination in one game and still walk out an incredible failure doesn't lead to a happy table, especially when strategy discussion is mostly moot by gameplay.

The theme on this game is really cool, and comes through very well.  I don't feel like the special abilities do enough to make each character feel unique, and you can only use them if you have enough motivation to get rid of Hitler.  Felt very Pandemic like... but I didn't find the options / actions as interesting.  So all in all cool game (because of the theme), even if the mechanisms in the game are not really all that interesting.  Would definitely play again.

RATING: 8
Looking at the game in play, I thought it was crazy complicated. It really isn't.

In fact a highly thematic game with a relatively simple and straightforward ruleset is not common... and great when you play it. In my single play, we worked toward the goal but it always seemed out of reach, or unlikely to succeed. Then an opportunity comes, and we say to ourselves, "Should we take this? Should we wait for a better chance? But one may never come." This is [u]exactly[/u] the sort of tough decision a real conspirator would have to deal with. Real kudos for the design. Just brilliant.

Up to 3 plays and have generally enjoyed, and think there is a game here. But wow, it's just long. I really don't see how you can get the 60-75 minutes advertised on the box if you try to actually play cooperatively; I'd budget two hours, which is just too long. There are 84 event cards in the game, of which 70 will be in. Each card is a turn. Some number of the cards will get discarded, either to key events or specific events, but we're still looking at probably 60 turns in the game. While many will be quick, there are also logistics to be managed and risks to be taken, and keeping up a clip of a turn a minute is pretty aggressive. In the middle War the Military Support is likely to remain high, and any attempt either low-odds or impossible, which isn't super-interesting. So anyway, I'm toying with the idea of removing extra cards from each deck, maybe as many as two more from each, just to make the game move a bit better. Playing on any difficulty level above easy is going to be extremely hard anyway, so maybe just play on easy but take some cards out.
---
Played and enjoyed, but a bit worried about pacing - the box says about an hour, but we took two to get through 5 of the 7 card decks. Part of this was just how the event card flowed, with key events and others there is quite a bit of chaos on just how long the game is going to go, which is interesting but long outliers are not great for a first impression. Still, someone did their historical research on this one and it has a solid historical feel, quite good for a euro (I'm glad they didn't bow to EU custom and included a lot of Nazi iconography, which is obviously important to the historical setting). Anyway, this didn't quite feel as tight as the better co-ops in terms of always giving the players high-leverage stuff to do and managing tensions consistently well, but there is stuff t like here.

Part of the dynamics of the many assassination plots Hitler survived as that the conspirators always had to wait for an opening. They had to decide whether to take their chances on a window that wasn't optimal knowing that Hitler was very rarely vulnerable, or whether to wait. The game does capture this dynamic, although it doesn't always make compelling gaming - when Hitler's military support is very high there isn't a ton you can do, you just need to chip away at it and wait for events to turn in your favor.

Lastly, I'll just add that Black Orchestra seems to weirdly over-romanticize the conspirators. I get why it was done, to make the players feel more like the good guys than the actual historical conspirators may have been (for some of them their primary objection was not moral, it was just that Hitler was losing the war). But I have to think that the majority of the interest in this game will be people interested in the history? So why mess with it? One of the reasons that the early assassination attempts against Hitler failed is that the conspirators with Jthe clout to actually do something about him just didn't have that much of a problem with him until the war starting going south. It wasn't until the bomb plot that you had a serious conspiracy. Not quite sure if this all matters. But conspiring against Hitler in the game isn't nearly as hard as it would have been historically.

Black Orchestra is a strong blend of theme and streamlined mechanisms. You can tell the concept and setting were at the genesis of the design as the gameplay drives straight at it. 

During play you're moving around Europe avoiding Hitler and his deputies (Hess, Goebbels, etc.), trying to pick up items to build requirements to enact assassination plots. Plots culminate with a roll of a dice pool based on meeting minimum requirements with bonus dice for additional items and abilities. The game will come down to these tense and dramatic assassination rolls perhaps a couple times throughout play. The odds will be stacked against you and the success rate is very low.

More likely you will be tossed in jail by the SS and interrogated. You will need to manage your suspicion level to keep this from happening, and will also need to work to get your Motivation (commitment to the cause) appropriately high. 

A wonderful game that is likely not for everyone due to its difficulty and climax residing in rolling fistfuls of dice with at best a 40-50% chance of success, and typically much lower.

When a turn consists of one die roll, while other players at the table have full turns is never a good time in my book. When that happens 4-5 times in a row, the game becomes wildly boring, no matter how co-operative. Too much downtime between turns.

RATING: 4
The theme comes across just fine, and all but the player pawns are of high quality...but the gameplay was just not fun for me. While at first I enjoyed seeing Hitler and his deputies randomly move around the board, I eventually got tired of seeing safe spaces turn incredibly dangerous or Hitler moving halfway across the board just before you could do anything.

Thematic, yes! Fun, no.

The event cards also throw more chance into the game as most of them just move this track or that track up and down, which sometimes can destroy your plot. You know, once you finally got the gun, signature, Hitler in the pantry, two friends in Berlin...Oops, this card now says you don't want to kill Hitler anymore. Too bad! *Wah wah*

The game tries some interesting twists on the tried and true cooperative genre, but I feel like they took one step too many down the random path. Maybe if Hitler moved in a more predictable way, or the motivation track was not as fluctuating, the game would feel better. But the game just felt too random and frustrating in a way far beyond any other cooperative game I've played to date.

El juego es ágil y funciona. Aunque por temática y quizás por estética podría parecer complejo en un principio, es muy accesible y bastante sencillo (ligero medio).

Quizás esperaba algo más de inmersión y al final es más un juego de mecánicas aderezado con un temática muy atractiva.

I finally get how to play the game:
- keep quiet and draw cards until you get a plot
- the player with the plot plus maybe another one must keep their suspicion as low as possible. This also avoids everybody getting arrested by the Gestapo
- the rest of the players conspire like crazy in order to boost the player holding the plot (not themselves!), lower the military support and gain actions to reveal necessary tiles.
- gather mitigation cards (crucial!)
- wait for the right moment and strike

Main issues I have with the game:
- too much randomness for my taste
- too many dead turns

Great theme, not so impressive execution.

Love it, great combination of mechanics and theme where they really compliment each other.  We felt like conspirators, felt desperate, felt like we needed to wait but had to go for it, and debated such excitedly and breathlessly and urgently.

This could go up from a 9 if it holds up (3 plays in quick succession thus far, across a four day span after purchase).  Very few games have generated this much excitement for me and my fellow gamers.

Was really interested in this game until i "broke" it on Tabletopia, legitimately winning the game in 2/3 rounds and in doing so finding the game to feel fake and stagey, as if the drama from the game is only delivered by the games manufactured inefficiency, which in turn is largely delivered by randomness. If such randomness aligns then you just win and think "well that felt cheap". Strange experience. High Score remains for its originality and theme.

I have watched the playthrough and found out that this game is more a game of chance than strategy. There is wayyyy too much luck in it.

I would chop the luck factor in two by making the choices of the players matter in the game. All I see in the course of the game is gauges going up and down due to some random factors and not because of their actions. Sure, there should be events, but only ONE per whole turn, not per player's turn. You shuffle each deck (1 to 7) pick like 3-6 cards depending on the length of the period represented by the pile of cards so players will have 3-6 turns each before moving on in the war. I would also reveal all tiles on the board once a region is activated but still distribute them randomly., at least we can plan our turn, have a goal.

There are other things that bothers me in the game, but they are small things. The main downside to the game is its huge reliability on luck rather than being a car and mouse game where players takes tough decisions to take down the Fuhrer. So it falls into the ameritrash category. If there was less luck in the game and more strategy and the decisions a player takes are worthwhile, then I would definitively recommend this game.

Remove half the amount of randomness in your game and I will give it an 8.5 or even 9 out of ten here.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2017)

A friend compared Black Orchestra to Pandemic and as I heavily dislike Pandemic my desire to play Black Orchestra was very low. After playing it, I can say it was an interesting experience, but the luck factor is too much for me.

The rules of the game aren’t very complex but there are many of them. You can explain the game under 18 minutes. The game board has an useful summary of all the rules so the game moves at a quick pace. Playtime is around 60-120 minutes. It depends on the player count.

The game´ s components are good and the art is good as well. 

I really like the theme, and the game feels very thematic, that is, the game mechanisms do support the theme. I love that the game comes with lots of characters to play, each with his own set of abilities.  

The game´s decisions aren’t very hard. There are lots of them at the beginning so the first couple of turns are very slow. You need to get a good plot and also need to get the elements required to finish it, then you need to move Hitler to the place specified by the plot and then you have to throw some dice to try to kill it. It sounds great on paper and it was fun at the beginning of the game, but later it becomes repetitive. 

Black Orchestra is a hard game to beat, but it is hard due to the uncontrollable luck factor of the events, items, cards and dice, not because the decisions are hard to made and that’s why I didn’t enjoy the game very much. Your ability to plan is very limited and you don’t know where Hitler is going to move next or if you have the right plots to catch him. The cards that allow you to move Hitler are VERY valuable.

When a players is being interrogated he doesn’t participate in the game, that can be boring if it goes for too long.
 
Bottom line, Black Orchestra is a mediocre CoOp game, highly thematic but not fun enough for me. The luck factor is what makes the game very hard to beat, the decisions needed to play the game aren’t very hard. Your ability to plan is very low. It is, however, way better than expected and I could play again if requested but I won’t buy it. My desire to play it again is low. 

Current Rating: 4.5

Rulebook is easy to grasp and rules straight forward. The dice add a random element to the game which I think works for this theme. The quality of the components keep this at an 8.5-9 for me (e.g.  hollow plastic pawns and some corners peeling up on the board and dossier cards). Overall great game and theme. PS. Thanks for not going "PC" and sanitizing the nazi symbology. Having those symbols as they were make the game more sinister and more realistic which adds to the richness of the theme. 

First Victory - Game 3: Carl Goerdeler, Suspicion low, Motivation Zealous, Kidnap plot, Military Support 3, two re-roll cards, 6th stage. Hitler kidnapped and murdered.

Game 4: Carl Goerdeler, Suspicion low, Motivation committed, train derail plot, Military Support 4, two re-roll cards, 4th stage. Hitler train derailed and instantly killed.

As a history buff, this game really hits home. It's a tour through WW II and trying to get rid of Hitler. The tensions does ramp up as you very often need to make the perfect roll or hope you have the cards to modify your dice when attempting your plot. Really great game that my wife, who isn't the biggest history or war fan, can get into and enjoy. The thing about the game though is it is very dependent on dice rolls so the there a good deal of luck involved.

Have since traded it as I've realized teaching history for a living and coming home on my down as fun as the game is, there are other non historic games I'd rather play just to take a break :-)

This game was given to me by my brother in law & sister in law and may end up being the sleeper pick of my Christmas haul. My wife and I played it today and loved it! The WW2 theme is beautifully implemented throughout and while there is luck in the dice roll, their is a beautiful balance between taking a calculated approach to the assination attempt and feeling the tension of being a conspirator who is willing to risk it all for a chance to bring down Hitler. This game is excellent especially if you are interested in the history of WW2.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Uncertain what to think after my first play. It is a good history lesson and each game will be somewhat different depending on what cards are randomly removed from the game. However, it appears you either get lucky and assassinate Hitler early or more likely try to wait out the game and assassinate him once the war goes poorly and his military level is low again. Still, each assassination attempt is up to a roll of dice and you usually only get 3-5 dice at base level which can be modified using a few cards that hidden in the player deck. Each time you roll a die, there is a 1 in 3 chance of success.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game carries the theme really well and leaves some dark aftertaste, especially when losing the game (which is, by the way, pretty common--it is rather tough to win). In many ways, the game positively stands out of the typical coop crowd.

What a great game!  Black Orchestra is a cooperative game in which you and fellow players are traversing Germany and various cities in Eastern Europe collecting items and intel to ultimately assassinate Adolf Hitler.  Players randomly choose a player card in the beginning of the game representing a historical character who was involved in one of the many attempts on Hitler's life in the 1940's.  I drew Claus Von Stauffenberg (Tom Cruise's character in 'Valkyrie').  Each character has a unique ability but your motivation status needs to be high enough to utilize it.  For instance, normally players can only take up to 3 actions.  Von Stauffenberg's ability is to provide 4 actions.

Anyway, on your player card you'll want to manage Motivation (the higher the better) and Suspicion (the lower the better).  Throughout the game you are seeking plot cards and collecting the items needed by that card that allow you to enact the assassination attempt to the best of your ability (more items = more dice you're allowed to roll for the assassination attempt).  I failed in my attempt and when this happens, you lose all the resources (items) you gathered to perform the assassination.  It was back to the drawing board.  However, as all three of us had high suspicion, someone drew the Gestapo Raid card which threw us all in jail.  When that happens, it's game over.  You need at least one player to break you out.  Thus concluded our efforts to rewrite history.  Still, even in defeat this game was a blast.  The first couple rounds I was wondering when the fun would kick, but after a few trip-ups in learning the rules, we all bought in to the theme and the overall game itself.  

As I mentioned, there were three of us that played and that felt like a great number.  I'm sure four and five would be better yet.  While this game can be played with two players or even solo, I'm not sure of how that would play out.  For a co-op like Forbidden Island, two is a good number.  For Black Orchestra, I've got a feeling it just wouldn't be that great, but I could be wrong.  There's something about the teamwork with multiple people (3 or more) that made this a big winner for me.

Nice cooperative game with theme about assasinating Hitler. It's a cat and mouse game, trying to avoid Hitler and his agents while getting items, plot cards, and motivation up, then catching Hitler at the right place while not too high on the support track.

[Played 1 time]

Solo game that can be played cooperatively, with a (brave) original setting.
It doesn't offer many (significant) choices and it boils down to a single dice roll (you can and should grant yourself as many positive modifiers as possible, but it is still sheer luck; the difficulty level just changes the probability of passing that final roll, so they do not modify the challenge, just the probability to win ).

A challenging cooperative puzzle, but in this game the theme actually fits the mechanics and provides a compelling narrative. Unfortunately, part of the theme fitting the mechanic is that the successful execution of the plot to assassinate is a very chancy thing. So most games you work to get the plot together, find a good opportunity to make the attempt, and then fail because it requires a very luck die roll.

Love the historical premise of this. First playthrough I think I fixated too heavily on pulling the trigger without having cards in hand to augment my rolls for the better. Lost on a Gestapo raid that caught both conspirators (after having lost all stage 1 and 2 items to an earlier interrogation, which pretty much ended the game). Going to retry this one now that I'm more comfortable!

RATING: 6
Black Orchestra feels at times random.  But, that is a good thing in this game for me.  It adds to the tension of trying to plot and assassinate Hitler without being found out or arrested.  Luck definitely plays a part int his game and does make the game challenging, but since Hitler was never successfully assassinated in real life, it makes those failures a little more thematic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In this cooperative game for 1-5 players, you play a person in Nazi Germany trying to assasinate Hitler. Your character has certain motiviation and suspician. Ideally you want to increase your motivation which gives you bonuses, and you want to decrease your suspician so you won't be arrested when there are Gestapo raids. Each turn you can conspire by rolling dice, move, look for items, exchange items or draw action cards. The game is played through 7 epochs and there are event cards that represent each epoch that mirror the historical background. Hitler's military support will go up or down during these events, and to perform an assasination attempt you need a plot card and you need to roll dice to exceed Hitler's military level to suceed. A number of Gestapo raids are seeded in the 7 epochs as well. 

It's a fun game and it is hard to suceed. The game does create the tension in the era, wtih Hitler's lieutenants moving around, and reducing your powers, and events that increase your suspician.  Rating likely to rise with more plays.

Great co-op game where timing and teamwork are essential to win. I liked particularly the different seven war phases that deeply influence your possibility to succeed ( HItler is weaker in phase 1-2, strong phase 3-6 and weak again in phase 7). Enjoyable also in single player version.

A tense 1-5 player cooperative game that rewards careful planning over quick thinking.

My only real complaint is that even with perfect planning and every complication mitigated as much as possible, the game still heavily relies on luck. This factor is especially compounded in the higher difficulty settings and can make victory highly improbable in even the best of circumstances, which really takes a lot of the joy out of the game.

Unique. Awesome personal-fantasy-type game aesthetic. This could even go up with repeated plays, unless replayability becomes an issue.

Highly recommended.

It's a highly thematic co-op game where you try to plot for assassination of Hitler while the WWII unravels around you. It's very historic, except the fact that here you can succeed in killing the Fuhrer and saving millions of lives. 
I actually got super excited to play even while I was reading the rules and can say that the game is great and I can't praise it enough! Love the theme, the co-op nature, the historic event cards, the various plots, the characters! There's luck in the dice rolls but I find it also very thematic, since, well, the Schwartze Kapelle's plot was uncovered after all. 
I really recommend checking Black Orchestra out, especially if you are partial to the WWII theme and like richly themed co-ops.

Enjoyable if you like co-op games. There's a lot of chaos (randomness) throughout this game; things happen constantly which you have no control over. Ordinarily that would bother me but I feel here it works well with the theme. I mean, you're trying to assassinate Hitler and so you need things to line up just right before you strike. Not easy (even when played on Easy difficulty) but the tension does escalate as the game goes. I don't think I'd suggest this often but if suggested I'd be up for it.
Players who need solid strategy will want to stay away as this experience is a huge battle against a constant onslaught of chaos. It's all about the tactics and making the best choices you can at any given moment. And usually, in the end, it comes down to one last stitch attempt which either succeeds or totally fails.

Very thematic and very, very luck dependent. I feel that the game needs more dice mitigation options. You can have a great plan, execute it well, have good odds, fail the dice roll, and repeat that three more times until the game ends in an unsatisfying loss.  Or you can get very lucky at the beginning of the game and win with little effort. Despite that, playing the game is a lot of fun.

Excellent historical co-op game. Filled with theme. The longer the game lasts the bigger the pressure and the pain, the choices become harder.

The game was OK and certainly clever in some respects. It would be more enjoyable with at least four players, but even then the game seems to lack significant interaction. 

Also, being caught by the Gestapo isn't a big deal. You get arrested and then let go over and over until 1945 (when you finally get put to death). It takes you out of the game, but it didn't feel right.

This is an INCREDIBLE cooperative game. The theme came though brilliantly. When Hitler did things I didn't like, my character's motivation went up. Very hard game to win, so if you have a chance to play a plot (even an unlikely one) take your shot!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A co-op game that I find to be truly cooperative and less prone to one player dictating what everyone should do, but admit this might depend on the game group and the social dynamics.  One aspect that helps is the "interrogation by the Gestapo" for arrested players where that decision must be made the player and cannot be discussed with the table co-operatively.  

The tension is high as the challenge (even at the lower difficulty levels) is high as well.  The story that unfolds as the game feels like it is simulating the events of history. The emotion (both of the players as well as the motivation/suspicion of the conspirators) will ebb and flow as the war flows and ebbs waiting for the opportune moment to put the plan in action.  Despite the number of possible plots, the conspirators need to focus on the one (or two) that has the best chance of success and organize themselves for that effort against of background of suspicion, raids, and arrests as the war progresses.

Relatively easy mechanics, lots of player aids/prompts on the board allow the game to be set-up, explained, and started in short order even with all new players.  

If it matters - the game is true to history and uses historically accurate symbology throughout.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Had high expectations going in but after playing, it just seems too random and luck dependent for me.  A lot of the time you are just hoping for rolls to go your way or to draw the right cards.  The events can be fun and the art/history is interesting but gameplay itself is just average.

I feel like a caveat is needed here: I do not like co-op games. There are a lot of trappings about co-op games that I just plain do not like or find fun. That being said, this is one of the better co-op games I have played. There are several things that this game does right. First and foremost, it captures the theme. The historical nature comes out in a very evocative way. The game also captures the feel of being conspirators working together to take out Hitler. After a few turns there might be multiple plot cards, and the players need to stay flexible and work together to make it happen. The biggest plus about this game is it felt like we were working to accomplish something. I can not stand to play co-op games where the whole game is about preventing losing, rather than doing something to win.

RATING: 8.5
It's fantastic to have a coop that tries (and achieves) to separate itself from 'Pandemic'. With a theme that sets the diference, and the pressure of trying to kill Hitler being there even before you begin playing, 'Black Orchestra' is, for my money, one of the best cooperative games you can play nowadays.

I'm always on the lookout for a good co-op and this is one that tackles a tough subject really well.  Managing Motivation and Suspicion while trying to put a plot together and not all get arrested was a really fun time and you truly felt like you were playing against another player and not just the game.  I love the Key Event impact and the Conspire mechanic is very fun.  Great stuff.

I don't play a lot of co-ops at all, and if I compare this to Pandemic it's a less streamlined design. But Black Orchestra is rich in theme and I do like the speed of gameplay. This comes out pretty often!

[2 plays] Most thematically woven co-op game I have played. We lost the first time but succeeded the second in assassinating the bastard Adolph. The artwork is terrific in this game and it seems balanced for a real challenge. The fear of imprisonment and SS torture is real.

RATING: 6
Rated as a solo game (pretty much the only way I enjoy most co-ops). Played controlling 2 random characters.

2 plays (medium difficulty), 2 wins ... too easy? Still, the game does a surprisingly good job evoking the theme (players are in a conspiracy during WW2 trying to assassinate Hitler):
- you have to get your own motivation up in order to be able to do the more dangerous things
- Hitler and aids move around randomly, and Gestapo raids spring up randomly; you're always worried that something will just end up in your space and hurt you! In the case of raids, though, it's not quite as bad: once the card(s) have come up in an event stack, you know you're safe from them at least until you're into the next stack
- plots come randomly into your hand, and then you have to run around getting the stuff you need in order to enact the plot, all while trying to avoid raising too much suspicion
- when you (finally) get your hand full of the right combination of cards and items, success comes down to a die roll; it's always possible that you'll simply fail due to bad luck!

Production is quite good, with a very helpful summary of key rules printed at the bottom of the board. However:
- the pawns could have been nicer
- the Hitler/aid chits are, for me, hard to find on the board. I think they would be better (more visible) if they were in stands?
- it would be nice if you could see the printed board text hidden behind the item tokens. Since that never changes, it shouldn't really be hidden (I don't like bothering with memory elements in games).

Gameplay is also good. I'd guess that fans of co-ops would love this, actually! Except maybe for how random it can be: despite your best efforts at putting together what you need, you might just not roll well enough. That probably fits the theme pretty well, but may not be so popular with people who want a more logic-y deduction-y cooperative game. For me, as someone who almost always (Pandemic Legacy being the lone exception so far) hates multiplayer co-ops, I might be willing to try this again at the hardest difficulty, but I'm not especially hungering for it -- a bit too much randomness/luck in it for my tastes.

A super polarizing game. People will either love it or hate it. If you're cool with everything coming down to one dice roll then go ahead and start conspiring because this game is rich with theme and depth. But be warned...it can feel like a slog with the wrong people.

I'm not sure when I'll get this out again. The theme makes it something I sort of hate playing.

Would love to play this again. Really difficult co-op game. Seems like it's better to try to kill Hitler with a small chance earlier than waiting for better odds because the whole game can change in a minute making it impossible to do the plan you meant to, or someone ends up in jail.

RATING: 8
Better than similar games (e.g., Covert). Difficulty level (for success) fairly high, as it should be (because the historical event never occurred, of course). Extremely thematic and relatively easy to learn, but can also be very swingy due to luck elements (I'm OK with that because the historical narrative is so strong). Quite the build-up, followed by roller-coaster rides.

Enjoyed it quite a bit!

While the theme does stand out and the historical details are accurate and well integrated into the game play, Black Orchestra fell flat for me. Rather than tense, I found it a bit dull and repetitive. Worse, it seemed that the random event cards revealed each round have far more influence on whether an assassination attempt on Hitler will succeed than anything the players do. Still, everything worked well enough that I'd play it again if requested. It just lacked the sort of appeal and player control needed for me to be the one requesting to play.

(Based on 4 plays in 8 days, including 2 wins.)

A co-op game that either keeps you on the edge of your seat or bemoaning your impending defeat while still allowing victory to be snatched from its jaws at the last minute.

While I can see this game becoming somewhat repetitive with time in terms of the the broad play arc, it does a good job of randomizing individual sessions with the layout of items, drawing of plot and event cards, and unpredictable movement of Hitler and his deputies. The roll of dice to conspire or plot and the Interrogation cards substantially mitigate the alpha player effect.

The release of tension when a plot fails - or, better, succeeds - at the last minute keeps you motivated to continue.

Because you'll have very few opportunities to actually get to the point of enacting a plot with enough dice and cards to have a good chance of success, the 'kill two deputies' variant adds a significant challenge, even on Easy level - do you wait until Hitler and his associates are in one space and try to take them out together, or do you risk several attempts at individual deputies and risk squandering your hoarded resources?

I wouldn't want to play this every week, but I'm enjoying this one.

One of the few Co-ops I really like to play.  The theme and narrative of the game combined with the history of the time period has this game firing on all cylinders for me. 
It is tough to beat?  Yes.  And that reflects history -- Hitler was a difficult man to kill and there was no successful attempt.  Many, many plots failed and many people died trying to oust him.

Another first time play where none of us realised the significanc of moving potential useful equipment to new locations in preparation for an attempt on Hitler's life as this reduced suspicion levels. We all went into Gestapo headquarters, without even making an attempt on the Fuhrer's life, and were given a right going over until we confessed!

A game that is just not fun. It is definitely much longer than an hour and a half. I played a five player game and half of us were bored to tears half way through the game as we realized that our chances of winning this game even if we did everything right would come down to an extremely lucky die roll. Basicly rolling better then the odds.  The only thing that kept us going was not knowing the cards and figuring that there had to be cards that gave you more dice, NOPE. Now that I know that is pretty much not the case I won't play again.

I like the concept of the game, but I'm not sold on the dice rolling as a resolution mechanic. It definitely has that 'push your luck' element so maybe it fits but like many co-ops, once successfully complete I'm not sure I need to play it again.

Caveat: this is based off of one partial play. Game seemed tense but luck seemed to be a huge (almost too huge) factor. No amount of planning seemed to go our way but that could be because we were fleshing out the strategy portion. Definitely willing to try it again.

WWII themed cooperative effort to coordinate and execute the assassination of the Fuhrer against the mounting odds of history.  At first the subject matter was off-putting for me but the historically based story of members of the Third Reich conspiring against him is really interesting and alleviated my concern.  The player board tracks for commitment and suspicion are perfect measures of individuals being driven to revolt.  The point-to-point board movement through Germany for pick-up-deliver to gather mission intel and resources chased by the unpredictable Gestapo adds great tension.  The historical progression of the event deck creates a sinking feeling of doom with each foiled attempt as time counts down and Hitler's power expands.  I like the concept of push-your-luck to get more actions at the risk of raising suspicion.  Getting caught and incarcerated as a conspirator but able to get busted out by your cohorts is a welcome and thematic alternative to avoid player elimination.  For me this is a solid, clever, and climactic challenge that introduces game elements that I hope to see showing up in future games.

I was not surprised to learn that the designer's first game had been published by Steve Jackson.  Black Orchestra would have fit comfortably into the SJ line in the 70s and 80, and the masses would have approved.  You know what also used to be great?  Asbestos as a building material.

In our case, muliple players ended up in Interrogation for 4+ rounds doing absolutely nothing.  I was one of them, and I could not have imagined a worse way to end the evening.  Except for jumping into [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178570/unusual-suspects]Unusual Suspects[/url] straight away, the surprisingly offensive game that was suggested next.

I've considered taking up a new hobby for months, and this really didn't help.

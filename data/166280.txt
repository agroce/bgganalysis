RATING: 6
Light Coloretto-like game of making piles and then choosing the best pile for you.  Main difference is that some cards are hidden and there are more ways to get negative points.

The area control mechanism of burning the village seemed excessive, but many in the group enjoyed it.

I'm not sure how I feel about this yet. I initially liked it quite a bit but I seem to like it a little less each time I play it.

Seems like two completely unrelated minigames with some guesswork in-between. Still will play it, would like to try it four player, that might be a load better!

Fun game where you're burning villages and nailing castles for points, a little bit of bluffing involved but really simplistic mechanics. Nice, simple artwork, fire meeples and I like how the round order determines how many of the three cards a player has to play facing down or up.

Finally a game where I can steal princesses, make trouble for my opponents and burn the land. I love dragons and this is filled with strategy and plotting.

I think this could be a fun little filler game, but rules are a bit unclear or needs some tweaking. Rating could go up.

A guessing game with some meaningful choices, but so much chaos as to render those choices devoid of strategy. 

Instead of bids, it features building offers of some face-up cards and some face-down cards. Then players, in turn order, just grab the pile that suits them. Echoes of the old Alan Moon game San Marco here in the building of the offers.

Poison the pot gameplay with odd little area control side game. Feels thematic.

RATING: 5
Takes some elements from Fairy Tale, Cleopatra, and Coloretto and combines them somewhat successfully.   The art has a nice whimsical style to it, but the card suits (colors) are not clear at all due to the heavy background.   Probably the biggest offender is that the scoring is terribly unclear and could have easily been fixed with a single good example in the rules.  Some artifact cards can be incredibly swingy.  All of this reeks of an underdeveloped, unpolished product.   The wooden flame bits are nicely done.   If you don't have any of the aforementioned games, this could nicely fill a gap in your collection.

Sort of felt like two separate mini games being played at once, worked well enough, but a bit muddled for my tastes. The theme of strafing villages as a dragon comes through.

Really like the theme!  There's some interesting strategy in this game too.  A mix of psychological and mechanical strategy  Only have been able to play the 2 player version so far.  Looking forward to what the 4 player version will bring to the table.

This game is just a bunch of fun. It's set collection with a bit of bluffing and village burning on the side.

An innovative and fun design. I'm often fond of you-cut-I-choose mechanisms, and this takes them in a very innovative direction. It's got interesting choices and fun set collection and some great fantasy art.

Easily a fan favorite at our gaming table. Since its arrival, a gaming day hasn't gone by that we have not played it. 

There is a remarkable amount of strategy that comes with these simple mechanics. Knowing when and where on the board to sweeten the pot to drive your opponents to place valuables in a certain castle, ignore your hidden treasures, or cede the coveted first-turn for the next round is devilishly fun.

Yes, luck plays a modest role in how you're going to end up point-wise, but the same can be said of all board games. Admittedly, it's hugely frustrating when you take a castle with a negative point value or sprinkle high-point cards in the 3rd or 4th castles in order to claim 1st turn-order, then only getting cards that are absolutely lousy for that position, but that's part of the gamble.

I'd also say it's usually surprisingly balanced. We've had a couple ties, and several within a few points of one another. Rarely does someone get completely smashed, which keeps everyone happy--nobody likes to suffer through a boardgame where they haven't a chance.

The theme is delightful and, honestly, I just wish I had more. Expansion pack?

A nice quick card game that plays quite differently depending on the number of players. A two-player game is much more psychological match against your opponent related to the hidden cards where a single good bluff or gamble can cause a huge swing. When more players are involved the village game takes on greater role towards a win. I've yet to play it with someone who isn't eager for another game.

Card drafting fantasy filler taking the roles of competing dragons collecting treasure and razing villages. The game mechanics explore imperfect and inside information in building draft piles containing revealed and hidden cards that can be desirable like a powerful dragon flame or princess, or cause harm like knights and curses. This draft system largely reminds me of Stockpile. I like how the unique set collecting rules fit with the theme. Does your dragon want variety of treasure or is it competing to amass a horde of a single kind.

If you like strategic decision making (sometimes manipulating, sometime conflicting, and sometimes risk taking) with hidden elements then this game is for you if you need a light filler.
